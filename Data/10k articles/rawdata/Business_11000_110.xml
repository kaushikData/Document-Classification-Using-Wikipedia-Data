'''Abigail Aldrich "Abby" Rockefeller''' (born 1943) is an American ecologist, feminist, and member of the [[Rockefeller family]]. She is the eldest daughter of [[David Rockefeller]] and Margaret McGrath.
__TOC__

== Feminism and left-wing politics ==
Drawn to radical humanism on the behalf of women (feminism) and leftist politics, she was drawn to [[Marxism]] and was an ardent admirer of [[Fidel Castro]] and a late 1960s/early 1970s [[radical feminism|radical feminist]]&lt;ref&gt;Echols, Alice, ''Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America: 1967–1975'' (Minneapolis, Minn.: Univ. of Minn. Press, 1989 ({{ISBN|0-8166-1787-2}})), pp. 158 (&amp; perhaps n. 106), 163 &amp; nn. 132–133, &amp; 211 &amp; n. 37 (author then visiting asst. prof. history, Univ. of Ariz. at Tucson).&lt;/ref&gt; who briefly belonged to the organization Female Liberation Front (not to be confused with a much later group called Female Liberation run by the [[Trotskyite]] SWP) before it changed its name to Cell 16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/M122findprint.htm Northeastern University Archives and Special Collections].&lt;/ref&gt; She joined [[Cell 16]] (founded in 1968) in 1969 to work with Betsy Warrior, Roxanne Dunbar, [[Dana Densmore]], Jayne West and others who were providing ground-breaking feminist analyses.

Abby Rockefeller and Jayne West joined other members of Cell 16 in promoting self-defense for women and became skilled in [[karate]]. They set up a [[Tae Kwon Do]] studio in Boston and taught hundreds of women who, in turn, taught other women, becoming pioneers in self-defense for women. This effort was initiated in response to the frequent, if unremarked, street harassment and sexual assaults women were subjected to during this era. After reading the literature of Cell 16, especially the initial "Journals of Female Liberation", Abby Rockefeller decided to join them. One of the articles she contributed to the Journals of Female Liberation was Sex: The Basis of Sexism, which posited male desire to access and control female sexuality for their own ends as a driving force in sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/1/16/feminist-says-physical-desire-is-cause |work=The Harvard Crimson|title= Feminist Says Physical Desire Is Cause of Female Oppression|first= Hollis |last=Gorman|date= January 16, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being infiltrated by Trotskyites and [[FBI agent|F.B.I. agents]], Cell 16 disassociated from its splinter group Female Liberation, which was providing a front for Trotskyist recruiting of aspiring feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Online. [[Ruth Rosen]], ''The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America''. New York and London: Penguin, 2000. The FBI was apparently able to recruit informers to attend meetings and report back to the FBI with ease. Bureau files contain summaries of feminist meetings with such subversive aims as, "They wanted equal opportunities that men have in work and in society" (p. 242).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Woman'', a Toronto-based feminist newspaper with cross-Canada circulation "Infiltration of the Women's Movement by the LSA/YS" Issue: Nov.-Dec. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/life/905W-000-004.html|title=LIFE MAGAZINE - AN 'OPPRESSED MAJORITY' DEMANDS ITS RIGHTS - 905W-000-004|year=1969 |first=SARA |last=DAVIDSON|website=www.maryellenmark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Complete-set-More-Fun-Games/dp/1888009306|title=Complete set of No More Fun &amp; Games|first1=Dana|last1=Densmore|first2=|last2=editor|date=1 October 1968|publisher=Cell 16|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Despite her class background, Abby was subjected to many of the stinging barbs other women are subjected to.  For instance, as a young girl she was told that although women did most of the cooking in the world only men could be great chefs.  In her own relationships with men she often encountered the same sexist attitudes when they expressed an underlying trivialization or contempt for women's aspirations - no matter the man's class or race.  Her feminism was not some dilettante's passing fad, but arose from an analysis of her lived experience.  Some, mistakenly misreading her commitment to justice as vulnerability, tried to exploit her for her name or money.&lt;ref&gt;Conversations with Cell 16, Schlesinger Library, Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dubious |Talk:Abby Rockefeller |reason=Incorrect or dubious sourcing of Conversations with Cell 16, Schlesinger Library, Harvard University |date=June 2017}}

== Founding of Clivus Multrum, Inc. ==
More recently Abby Rockefeller has written extensively about the ineffectiveness of conventional sewage treatment and its destructive effect on water and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rockefeller, Abby A. |url=http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_16631.cfm |title=Civilization &amp; Sludge: Notes on the History of the Management of Human Excreta |journal=Current World Leaders |volume=39 |issue=6 |publisher=Organic Consumers Association |year=1997 |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a proponent of alternative methods in dealing with human excreta, specifically by using the [[clivus multrum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivusmultrum.com/ |title=Clivus Multrum, Inc.: Manufacturer of Composting Toilets and Greywater Systems since 1973 |publisher=Clivusmultrum.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKay |first=Jeff |url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/crapshoot_the_gamble_with_our_wastes/ |title=Crapshoot: The Gamble with Our Wastes |publisher=National Film Board of Canada |year=2003 |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; model of [[composting toilet]] rather than the conventional [[flush toilet]].

'''Academic analytics''' is basically defined as the process of evaluating and analysing organisational data received from university systems for reporting and decision making reasons (Campbell, &amp; Oblinger, 2007). According to Campbell &amp; Oblinger (2007), accrediting agencies, governments, parents and students are all calling for the adoption of new modern and efficient ways of improving and monitoring student success. This has ushered the higher education system into an era characterised by increased scrutiny from the various stakeholders. For instance, the Bradley review acknowledges that benchmarking activities such as student engagement serve as indicators for gauging the institution’s quality (Commonwealth Government of Australia, 2008). 

Increased competition, accreditation, assessment and regulation are the major factors encouraging the adoption of   analytics in   higher education. Although institutions of higher learning gather a lot of vital data that can significantly aid in solving problems like attrition and retention, the collected data is not being analysed adequately and hence translated into useful data (Goldstein, 2005.) Subsequently, higher education leadership are forced to make critical and vital decisions based on inadequate information that could be achieved by properly utilising and analysing the available data (Norris, Leonard, &amp; strategic Initiatives Inc., 2008). This gives rise to strategic problems. This setback also depicts itself at the tactical level. Learning and teaching at institutions of higher education if often a diverse and complex experience. Each and every teacher, student or course is quite different. However, LMS is tasked with taking care of them all. LMS is at the centre of academic analytics. It records each and every student and staff’s information and results in a click within the system. When this crucial information is added, compared and contrasted with different enterprise information systems provides the institution with a vast array of useful information that can be harvested to gain a competitive edge (Dawson &amp; McWilliam, 2008; Goldstein, 2005; Heathcoate &amp; Dawson, 2005).

In order to retrieve meaningful information from institution sources i.e. LMS, the information has to be correctly interpreted against a basis of educational efficiency, and this action requires   analysis from people with learning and teaching skills. Therefore, a collaborative approach is required from both the people guarding the data and those who will interpret it, otherwise the data will remain to be a total waste (Baepler &amp; Murdoch, 2010). Decision making at its most basic level is based on presumption or intuition (a person can make conclusions and decisions based on experience without having to do data analysis) (Siemens &amp; Long, 2011). However, a lot of decisions made at institutions of higher learning are too vital to be based on anecdote, presumption or intuition since significant decisions need to be backed by data and facts.

Analytics, which is often termed as business intelligence,  has   come out as new software and hardware that enables businesses to gather and analyse large amounts of information or data. The analytics process is made up of gathering, analysing, data manipulation and employing the results to answer critical questions such as ‘why’. Analytics was first applied in the admissions department in higher education institutions. The institutions normally used some formulas to choose students from a large pool of applicants. These formulas drew their information from high school transcripts and standardized test scores. In today’s world, analytics is commonly used in administrative units such as fund raising and admissions. The use and application of academic analytics is meant to grow due to the ever-increasing concerns about student success and accountability. Academic analytics primarily marries complex and vast data with [[predictive modelling]] and statistical techniques to better decision making. Current academic analytics initiatives are bent to use data to predict students experiencing difficulty (Arnold, &amp; Pistilli, 2012, April). This allows advisors and faculty members to intervene by tailoring procedures which will meet the student’s learning needs (Arnold, 2010). As such, academic analytics possesses the ability to improve learning, student success and teaching. Analytics has become a valuable tool for institutions because of its ability to predict, model and improve decision making.

== Analytic Steps ==

Analysis is made up of five basic steps: capture, report, predict, act and refine
Capture: All analytic efforts are centred on data. Consequently, academic analytics can be rooted in data from various sources such as a CMS, and financial systems (Campbell, Finnegan,  &amp; Collins, 2006). Additionally, the data comes in various different formats for example spread sheets. Also, data can be got from the institution’s external environment. To capture data, academic analytics needs to determine the type of available data, methods of harnessing it and the formats it is in. 
Report: After the data has been captured and stored in a central location, analysts will examine the data, perform queries, identify patterns, trends and exceptions depicted by the data. The standard deviation and mean (descriptive statistics) are mostly generated.

Predict: After analysing the warehoused data through the use of statistics, a predictive model is developed. These models vary depending on the question nature and type of data. To develop a probability, these models employ statistical regression concepts and techniques. Predictions are made after the use of statistical algorithms.

Act:  The major goal and aim of  analytics is to enable the institution to take actions based on the probabilities and predictions made. These actions might vary from invention to information. The interventions to address problems might be in the form of a personal email, phone call or an automated contact from faculty advisors about study resources and skills, such as office hours or help sessions. Undoubtedly, institutions have to come up with appropriate mechanisms for impact measurement; such as did the students actually respond or attend the help sessions when invited.
Refine: Academic analytics should also be made up of a process aimed at self-improvement. Statistics processes should be continually updated since the measurement of project impacts is not a one-time static effort but rather a continual effort. For instance, admission analytics should be updated or revised yearly. 

===Comprehending Involved Stakeholders===
Analytics affects  executive officers, students, faculty members, IT staff and student affairs staff. Whereas students will be keen to know academic analytics will affect their grades, faculty members will be interested in finding out how the information and data can be appropriated for other purposes (Pistilli,  Arnold &amp; Bethune, 2012). Moreover, the institution staff will be focussed on finding how the analysis will enable them to effectively accomplish their jobs while the institution president will be focussed on freshman retention and increase in graduation rates.

== Criticisms ==

Analytics have   been criticised for various reasons such as profiling. Their main use is to profile students into successful and unsuccessful categories. However, some individuals argue that profiling of students tends to bias people’s behaviours and expectations (Ferguson, 2012). Additionally, there is no clear guidelines on which profiling issues should be prohibited or allowed in institutions of higher learning.

The '''arms industry''', also known as the '''defense industry''' or the '''arms trade''', is a global [[industry classification|industry]] responsible for the [[manufacturing]] and sales of [[weapon]]s and [[military technology]]. It consists of a [[commerce|commercial]] [[industry]] involved in the [[research and development]], [[engineering]], production, and servicing of [[military]] material, equipment, and facilities. Arms-producing companies, also referred to as  '''arms dealers''', '''defence contractors''', or as the '''military industry''', produce arms for the [[armed forces]] of [[State (polity)|states]] and civilians. Departments of government also operate in the arms industry, buying and selling weapons, munitions and other military items. An [[arsenal]] is a place where arms and ammunition are made, maintained and repaired, stored, or issued, in any combination, whether privately or publicly owned. Products include [[gun]]s, [[artillery]], [[ammunition]], [[missile]]s, [[military aircraft]], [[military vehicle]]s, [[Naval ship|ship]]s, [[electronics|electronic systems]], [[night vision devices]], [[holographic weapon sight]]s, [[laser rangefinder]]s, [[laser sight]]s, [[hand grenades]], [[landmines]] and more. The arms industry also provides other logistical and operational support.

[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI) estimated that 2012 military expenditures were roughly $1.8 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sipri.org/yearbook/2013/03 SIPRI Yearbook 2013]. www.sipri.org. Retrieved on 2016-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a relative decline from 1990 when military expenditures made up 4% of world GDP. Part of the money goes to the procurement of military hardware and services from the military industry. The combined arms sales of the top 100 largest arms-producing companies amounted to an estimated $395 billion in 2012 according to SIPRI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sipriyearbook.org/view/9780198712596/sipri-9780198712596-chapter-5-div1-6.xml# Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]. Sipri.org. Retrieved on 2012-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 over $30 billion were spent in the international arms trade (a figure that excludes domestic sales of arms).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4238644.stm Arms trade key statistics]. BBC News (2005-09-15). Retrieved on 2012-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; According to SIPRI, the volume of international transfers of major weapons in 2010–14 was 16 per cent higher than in 2005–2009. The five biggest exporters in 2010–2014 were the United States, Russia, China, Germany and France, and the five biggest importers were India, Saudi Arabia, China, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title= Trends in International Arms Transfer, 2014|url= https://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=495|website= www.sipri.org|publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|accessdate= 18 March 2015|ref= SIPRI Fact Sheet, March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[industrialized countries]] have a domestic arms-industry to supply their own military forces. Some countries also have a substantial legal or illegal domestic trade in weapons for use by its citizens, primarily for self-defence, hunting or sporting purposes. [[Small arms trade|Illegal trade in small arms]] occurs in many countries and regions affected by [[political instability]]. The [[Small Arms Survey]] estimates that 875 million small arms circulate worldwide, produced by more than 1,000 companies from nearly 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/weapons-and-markets.html|title= Small Arms Survey&amp;nbsp;— Weapons and Markets- 875m small arms worldwide, value of authorized trade is more than $8.5b|date= 8 December 2014|publisher= |accessdate= 26 March 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Contracts to supply a given country's military are awarded by governments, making arms contracts of substantial political importance. The link between politics and the arms trade can result in the development of what [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] described as a [[military-industrial complex]], where the armed forces, commerce, and politics become closely linked, similarly to the [[European multilateral defence procurement]]. Various corporations, some publicly held, others private, bid for these contracts, which are often worth many billions of dollars. Sometimes, as with the contract for the international [[Joint Strike Fighter program|Joint Strike Fighter]], a competitive tendering process takes place, with the decision made on the merits of the designs submitted by the companies involved. Other times, no bidding or competition takes place.

==History==
{{further information|Military production during World War II}}
[[File:Ministry of Information First World War Official Collection Q30035.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Painting shells in a shell filling factory during [[World War I]].]]

During the [[early modern period]], France, United Kingdom, Netherlands and some states in Germany became self-sufficient in arms production, with diffusion and migration of skilled workers to more peripheral countries such as Portugal and Russia.

The modern arms industry emerged in the second half of the nineteenth century as a product of the creation and expansion of the first large [[military-industrial complex|military-industrial]] companies. As smaller countries (and even newly industrializing countries like Russia and Japan) could no longer produce cutting-edge military equipment with their indigenous resources and capacity, they increasingly began to contract the manufacture of military equipment, such as [[battleship]]s, [[artillery|artillery pieces]] and [[rifle]]s to foreign firms.

In 1854, the [[British government]] awarded a contract to the [[Elswick Ordnance Company]] of industrialist [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] for the supply of his latest breech loading rifled artillery pieces. This galvanised the private sector into weapons production, with the surplus being increasingly exported to foreign countries. Armstrong became one of the first international arms dealers, selling his weapon systems to governments across the world from Brazil to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamarmstrong.info/about-the-man|title=William George Armstrong (1810–1900)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, he opened a shipyard at [[Elswick Ordnance Company|Elswick]] to specialise in warship production—at the time, it was the only factory in the world that could build a battleship and arm it completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dougan, David |year=1970 |title=The Great Gun-Maker: The Story of Lord Armstrong|publisher=Sandhill Press Ltd. |isbn=0-946098-23-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory produced warships for many navies, including the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. Several Armstrong cruisers played an important role in defeating the Russian fleet at the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905.

In the American Civil War in 1861 the north had a distinct advantage over the south as it relied on using the breech-loading rifle against the muskets of the south. This began the transition to industrially produced mechanised weapons such as the Gatling gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Defense Industries - Military History - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|url = http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199791279/obo-9780199791279-0036.xml|website = www.oxfordbibliographies.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This industrial innovation in the defence industry was adopted by [[Prussia]] in 1866 &amp; 1870-71 in its defeat of Austria and France respectively. By this time the machine gun had begun entering into the militaries. The first example of its effectiveness was in 1899 during the [[Boer war|Boer War]] and in 1905 during the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. However, Germany were leaders in innovation of weapons and used this innovation nearly defeating the allies in [[World War I]].

In 1885, France decided to capitalize on this increasingly lucrative form of trade and repealed its ban on weapon exports. The regulatory framework for the period up to the [[First World War]] was characterized by a [[laissez-faire]] policy that placed little obstruction in the way of weapons exports. Due to the carnage of World War I, arms traders began to be regarded with odium as "merchants of death" and were accused of having instigated and perpetuated the war in order to maximise their profits from arms sales. An inquiry into these allegations in Britain failed to find evidence to support them. However, the sea change in attitude about war more generally meant that governments began to control and regulate the trade themselves.
[[File:Ministry of Information First World War Official Collection Q30049.jpg|thumb|Stacks of shells in the shell filling factory at Chilwell during World War I.]]
The volume of the arms trade greatly increased during the 20th century, and it began to be used as a political tool, especially during the [[Cold War]] where the United States and the USSR supplied weapons to their proxies across the world, particularly [[Third World|third world countries]] (see [[Nixon Doctrine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvGRBE1QxBUC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The International Arms Trade|author1=Stohl, Rachel |author2=Grillot, Suzette |year=2013|publisher=Wiley Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land-based weapon===
This category includes everything from [[SALW|light arms]] to [[heavy artillery]], and the majority of producers are small. Many are located in third world countries. International trade in [[handgun]]s, [[machine gun]]s, [[tanks]], [[armored personnel carrier]]s, and other relatively inexpensive weapons is substantial. There is relatively little regulation at the international level, and as a result, many weapons fall into the hands of organized crime, rebel forces, terrorists, or regimes under sanctions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpa.org/newsletter_info2584/newsletter_info.htm |title=International Defense Industry |accessdate=2007-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726062433/http://www.fpa.org/newsletter_info2584/newsletter_info.htm |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}. www.fpa.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Control Arms Campaign]], founded by [[Amnesty International]], [[Oxfam]], and the [[IANSA (NGO)|International Action Network on Small Arms]], estimated in 2003 that there are over 639 million small arms in circulation, and that over 1,135 companies based in more than 98 different countries manufacture small arms as well as their various components and ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main article|Aerospace manufacturer}}
Encompassing military aircraft (both land-based and [[naval aviation]]), conventional missiles, and [[military satellites]], this is the most technologically advanced sector of the market. It is also the least competitive from an economic standpoint, with a handful of companies dominating the entire market. The top clients and major producers are virtually all located in the [[western world]] and Russia, with the United States easily in first place. Prominent aerospace firms include [[Rolls Royce plc|Rolls Royce]], [[BAE]], [[Dassault Aviation]], [[Sukhoi]], [[Mikoyan]], [[EADS]], [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo]], [[Thales Group]], [[Lockheed Martin]],  [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Boeing]]. There are also several [[multinational corporation|multinational]] consortia mostly involved in the manufacturing of [[fighter jet]]s, such as the [[Eurofighter]]. The largest military contract in history, signed in October 2001, involved the development of the [[Joint Strike Fighter]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Naval systems===
Some of the world's [[great power]]s maintain substantial [[naval force]]s to provide a global presence, with the largest nations possessing [[aircraft carrier]]s, [[nuclear submarine]]s and advanced [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-air defense systems]]. The vast majority of military ships are conventionally powered, but some are [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]]. There is also a large global market in second-hand naval vessels, generally purchased by [[developing countries]] from [[Western world|Western]] governments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Cybersecurity industry ==
{{main article|Computer security}}
The cybersecurity industry is becoming the most important defence industry as cyber attacks are being deemed as one of the greatest risk to defence in the next ten years as cited by the NATO review in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2013/Industry/EN/index.htm|title = NATO review|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, high levels of investment has been placed in the cybersecurity industry to produce new software to protect the ever-growing transition to digitally run hardware. For the military industry it is vital that protections are used for systems used for reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence gathering. However, to protect the cyber world from attacks there are advanced cyber protection strategies used such as content, cloud and wireless security. These can be intertwined to form several secure layers.

Nevertheless, cyber attacks and cyber attackers have become more advanced in their field using techniques such as Dynamic Trojan Horse Network (DTHN) Internet Worm, [[Zero-Day Attack]], and Stealth Bot. As a result, the cybersecurity industry has had to improve the defence technologies to remove any vulnerability to cyber attacks using systems such as the Security of Information (SIM), Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) and [[DDoS]] techniques.

As the threat to computers grows, the demand for cyber protection will rise, resulting in the growth of the cybersecurity industry. It is expected that the industry will be dominated by the defence and homeland security agencies that will make up 40% of the industry.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Cyber security for the defence industry {{!}} Cyber Security Review|url = http://www.cybersecurity-review.com/industry-perspective/cyber-security-for-the-defence-industry|website = www.cybersecurity-review.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International arms transfers==
According to research institute, [[SIPRI]], the volume of international transfers of major weapons in 2010–14 was 16 per cent higher than in 2005–2009. The five biggest exporters in 2010–14 were the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, China and France, and the five biggest importers were India, Saudi Arabia, China, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Pakistan. The flow of arms to Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania, and the Middle East increased significantly between 2005–2009 and 2010–14, while there was a notable decrease in the flow to Europe.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

SIPRI has identified 60 countries as exporters of major weapons in 2010–14. The top 5 exporters during the period were responsible for almost 74 per cent of all arms exports. The composition of the five largest exporters of arms changed between 2005–2009 and 2010–14: while the United States and Russia remained by far the largest exporters, China narrowly, but notably, replaced Germany as the third largest exporter as Germany slid down to 6th place. The top 5 exported 14 per cent more arms in 2010–14 than the top 5 in 2005–2009.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 2010–14, 153 countries (about three-quarters of all countries) imported major weapons. The top 5 recipients accounted for 33 per cent of the total arms imports during the period (see table 2). India, China and the UAE were among the top 5 importers in both 2005–2009 and 2010–14. Asia and Oceania accounted for nearly half of imports in 2010–14, followed by the Middle East, Europe, the Americas and Africa (see figure 3). SIPRI also identified seven groups of rebel forces as importers of major weapons in 2010–14, but none of them accounted for more than 0.02 per cent of total deliveries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Please note that rankings for exporters below a billion dollars are less meaningful, as they can be swayed by single contracts. A much more accurate picture of export volume, free from yearly fluctuations, is presented by 5-year moving averages.

Next to SIPRI there are several other sources that provide data on international transfers of arms. These include national reports by national governments about arms exports, the UN register on conventional arms and an annual publication by the [[US Congressional Research Service|U.S. Congressional Research Service]] that includes data on arms exports to developing countries as compiled by [[US intelligence|U.S. intelligence]] agencies. A list of such sources can be found at the SIPRI website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sipri.org/contents/armstrad/ armstrad — www.sipri.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050520090124/http://www.sipri.org/contents/armstrad/ |date=May 20, 2005 }}. Sipri.org. Retrieved on 2012-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the different methodologies and definitions used different sources often provide significantly different data. 

=== World’s biggest postwar arms exporter===
SIPRI uses the "trend-indicator values" (TIV). These are based on the known unit production costs of weapons and represent the transfer of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://delano.lu/d/detail/news/worlds-biggest-postwar-arms-exporters/172983]&lt;/ref&gt;

Please note that arms import rankings fluctuate heavily as countries enter and exit wars. Export data tend to be less volatile as exporters tend to be more technologically advanced and have stable production flows. 5-year moving averages present a much more accurate picture of import volume, free from yearly fluctuations.

==Arms control==
{{main article|Arms control}}
Arms control refers to international restrictions upon the development, production, stockpiling, proliferation and usage of small arms, conventional weapons, and [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is Arms Control? |url=http://usforeignpolicy.about.com/od/defense/a/what-is-arms-control.htm |work=About.com, US Foreign Policy |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Barry Kolodkin |format=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically exercised through the use of [[diplomacy]], which seeks to persuade [[government]]s to accept such limitations through agreements and [[Treaty|treaties]], although it may also be forced upon non-consenting governments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20417">{{For|the accountancy use of the term|Capital account (financial accounting)}}

In [[macroeconomics]] and international finance, the '''capital account''' (also known as the '''financial account''') is one of two primary components of the [[balance of payments]], the other being the [[current account]]. Whereas the current account reflects a nation's net income, the capital account reflects net change in ownership of national assets.

A surplus in the capital account means money is flowing into the country, but unlike a surplus in the current account, the inbound flows effectively represent borrowings or sales of assets rather than payment for work. A deficit in the capital account means money is flowing out of the country, and it suggests the nation is increasing its ownership of foreign assets.

The term "capital account" is used with a narrower meaning by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and affiliated sources. The IMF splits what the rest of the world calls the capital account into two top-level divisions: ''financial account'' and ''capital account'', with by far the bulk of the transactions being recorded in its financial account.

==Definitions==
At high level:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \mbox{Capital account} &amp; = \mbox{Change in foreign ownership of domestic assets} \\
   &amp; - \mbox{Change in domestic ownership of foreign assets} \\
   
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Breaking this down:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

* [[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) refers to long-term capital investment, such as the purchase or construction of machinery, buildings, or whole manufacturing plants. If foreigners are investing in a country, that represents an inbound flow and counts as a surplus item on the capital account. If a nation's citizens are investing in foreign countries, that represents an outbound flow and counts as a deficit. After the initial investment, any yearly profits that are not reinvested will flow in the opposite direction but will be recorded in the current account rather than as capital.&lt;ref name = "sloman"&gt;{{cite book

* [[Portfolio investment]] refers to the purchase of shares and bonds. It is sometimes grouped together with "other" as short-term investment. As with FDI, the income derived from these assets is recorded in the current account; the capital account entry will just be for any buying or selling of the portfolio assets in the international [[capital markets]].&lt;ref name = "sloman"/&gt;
* ''Other investment'' includes capital flows into bank accounts or provided as loans. Large short-term flows between accounts in different nations commonly occur when the market can take advantage of fluctuations in interest rates and/or the exchange rate between currencies. Sometimes this category can include the ''reserve account''.&lt;ref name = "sloman"/&gt; 
* ''Reserve account''. The reserve account is operated by a nation's [[central bank]] to buy and sell foreign currencies; it can be a source of large capital flows to counteract those originating from the market. Inbound capital flows (from sales of the nation's foreign currency), especially when combined with a current account surplus, can cause a rise in value ([[Currency appreciation and depreciation|appreciation]]) of a nation's currency, while outbound flows can cause a fall in value (depreciation). If a government (or, if authorized to operate independently in this area, the central bank itself) does not consider the market-driven change to its currency value to be in the nation's best interests, it can intervene.&lt;ref name = "IFM"&gt;{{cite book

===Central bank operations and the reserve account===
Conventionally, central banks have two principal tools to influence the value of their nation's currency: raising or lowering the base rate of interest and, more effectively, buying or selling their currency. Setting a higher interest rate than other major central banks will tend to attract funds via the nation's capital account, and this will act to raise the value of its currency. A relatively low interest rate will have the opposite effect. Since World War II, interest rates have largely been set with a view to the needs of the domestic economy, and moreover, changing the interest rate alone has only a limited effect.&lt;ref name = "Wilmott"&gt;{{cite book

A nation's ability to prevent a fall in the value of its own currency is limited mainly by the size of its foreign reserves: it needs to use the reserves to buy back its currency.&lt;ref&gt;By the law of supply and demand, reducing the supply of currency available by buying up large quantities on the forex markets tends to raise the price.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2013, a trend has developed for some central banks to attempt to exert upward pressure on their currencies by means of [[currency swap]]s rather than by directly selling their foreign reserves.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of foreign reserves, central banks may affect international pricing indirectly by selling assets (usually government bonds) domestically, which, however, diminishes liquidity in the economy and may lead to deflation.

When a currency rises higher than monetary authorities might like (making exports less competitive internationally), it is usually considered relatively easy for an independent central bank to counter this. By buying foreign currency or foreign financial assets (usually other governments' bonds), the central bank has a ready means to lower the value of its own currency; if it needs to, it can always create more of its own currency to fund these purchases. The risk, however, is general price inflation. The term "printing money" is often used to describe such monetization, but is an anachronism, since most money exists in the form of deposits and its supply is manipulated through the purchase of bonds. A third mechanism that central banks and governments can use to raise or lower the value of their currency is simply to talk it up or down, by hinting at future action that may discourage speculators. [[Quantitative easing]], a practice used by major central banks in 2009, consisted of large-scale bond purchases by central banks. The desire was to stabilize banking systems and, if possible, encourage investment to reduce unemployment. 
  
As an example of direct intervention to manage currency valuation, in the 20th century Great Britain's central bank, the [[Bank of England]], would sometimes use its reserves to buy large amounts of pound sterling to prevent it falling in value. [[Black Wednesday]] was a case where it had insufficient reserves of foreign currency to do this successfully. Conversely, in the early 21st century, several major emerging economies effectively sold large amounts of their currencies in order to prevent their value rising, and in the process built up large reserves of foreign currency, principally the US dollar.&lt;ref name = "wolf"&gt;{{cite book

Sometimes the reserve account is classified as "below the line" and thus not reported as part of the capital account.&lt;ref name = "IFM"/&gt; Flows to or from the reserve account can substantially affect the overall capital account. Taking the example of China in the early 21st century, and excluding the activity of its central bank, China's capital account had a large surplus, as it had been the recipient of much foreign investment. If the reserve account is included, however, China's capital account has been in large deficit, as its central bank purchased large amounts of foreign assets (chiefly US government bonds) to a degree sufficient to offset not just the rest of the capital account, but its large current account surplus as well.&lt;ref name = "wolf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, in late 2011 China also had periods when it was selling foreign reserves to prevent depreciation, this was due to surges of funds leaving the country through the private sector component of the capital account.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sterilization====
{{Main|Sterilization (economics)}}
In the financial literature, ''sterilization'' is a term commonly used to refer to operations of a central bank that mitigate the potentially undesirable effects of inbound capital: currency appreciation and inflation. Depending on the source, sterilization can mean the relatively straightforward recycling of inbound capital to prevent currency appreciation and/or a range of measures to check the inflationary impact of inbound capital. The classic way to sterilize the inflationary effect of the extra money flowing into the domestic base from the capital account is for the central bank to use [[open market operations]] where it sells bonds domestically, thereby soaking up new cash that would otherwise circulate around the home economy.&lt;ref&gt;

|date=1999-01-02
|author1=Sweta C. Saxena |author2=Kar-yiu Wong |publisher=[[University of Washington]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A central bank normally makes a small loss from its overall sterilization operations, as the interest it earns from buying foreign assets to prevent appreciation is usually less than what it has to pay out on the bonds it issues domestically to check inflation. In some cases, however, a profit can be made.&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher=[[European Central Bank|ECB]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the strict textbook definition, sterilization refers only to measures aimed at keeping the domestic monetary base stable; an intervention to prevent currency appreciation that involved merely buying foreign assets without counteracting the resulting increase of the domestic money supply would not count as sterilization. A textbook sterilization would be, for example, the Federal Reserve's purchase of $1 billion in foreign assets. This would create additional liquidity in foreign hands. At the same time, the Fed would sell $1 billion of debt securities into the US market, draining the domestic economy of $1 billion. With $1 billion added abroad and $1 billion removed from the domestic economy, the net capital inflow that would have influenced the currency's exchange rate has undergone sterilization.

===International Monetary Fund===
The above definition is the one most widely used in economic literature,&lt;ref&gt;Though with a few exceptions, e.g. ''International economics'' by Krugman and Obstfeld which uses the IMF definition in at least its 5th edition.&lt;/ref&gt; in the financial press, by corporate and government analysts (except when they are reporting to the IMF), and by the [[World Bank]]. In contrast, what the rest of the world calls the capital account is labelled the "financial account" by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and by the [[United Nations System of National Accounts]] (SNA). In the IMF's definition, the capital account represents a small subset of what the standard definition designates the capital account, largely comprising transfers.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heakal"/&gt; Transfers are one-way flows, such as gifts, as opposed to commercial exchanges (i.e., buying/selling and barter). The largest type of transfer between nations is typically foreign aid, but that is mostly recorded in the current account. An exception is [[debt relief|debt forgiveness]], which in a sense is the transfer of ownership of an asset. When a country receives significant debt forgiveness, that will typically comprise the bulk of its overall IMF capital account entry for that year.

The IMF's capital account does include some non-transfer flows, which are sales involving non-financial and non-produced assets—for example, natural resources like land, leases and licenses, and marketing assets such as brands—but the sums involved are typically very small, as most movement in these items occurs when both seller and buyer are of the same nationality.

Transfers apart from debt forgiveness recorded in the IMF's capital account include the transfer of goods and financial assets by migrants leaving or entering a country, the transfer of ownership on fixed assets, the transfer of funds received to the sale or acquisition of fixed assets, gift and inheritance taxes, death levies, and uninsured damage to [[fixed asset]]s.&lt;ref name = "IMFmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heakal"/&gt; In a non-IMF representation, these items might be grouped in the "other" subtotal of the capital account. They typically amount to a very small amount in comparison to loans and flows into and out of short-term bank accounts.

==Capital controls==
{{Main|Capital control}}
Capital controls are measures imposed by a state's government aimed at managing capital account transactions. They include outright prohibitions against some or all capital account transactions, [[Financial transaction tax|transaction taxes]] on the international sale of specific financial assets, or caps on the size of international sales and purchases of specific financial assets. While usually aimed  at the financial sector, controls can affect ordinary citizens, for example in the 1960s British families  were at one point restricted from taking more than £50 with them out of the country for their foreign holidays.&lt;ref name = "wolf"/&gt;  Countries without capital controls that limit the buying and selling of their currency at market rates are said to have full [[capital account convertibility]].

Following the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] agreement established at the close of World War II,  most nations put in place capital controls to prevent large flows either into or out of their capital account.  [[John Maynard Keynes]], one of the architects of the Bretton Woods system, considered capital controls to be a permanent part of the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Both advanced and emerging nations adopted controls;  in basic theory it may be supposed that large inbound investments will speed an emerging economy's development, but empirical evidence suggests this does not reliably occur, and in fact large capital inflows can hurt a nation's economic development by causing its currency to appreciate, by contributing to inflation, and by causing an unsustainable "bubble" of economic activity that often precedes financial crisis. The inflows sharply reverse once [[capital flight]] takes places after the crisis occurs.&lt;ref name = "Heakal"&gt;

As part of the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] in favour of free market orientated policies,  countries began abolishing their capital controls, starting between 1973–74 with the US, Canada, Germany and Switzerland  and followed by Great Britain in 1979.&lt;ref name = "inside"&gt;{{cite book

An exception to this trend was Malaysia, which in 1998 imposed capital controls in the wake of the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]].&lt;ref name = "hotMoney"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  
While most Asian economies didn't impose controls, after the 1997 crises they ceased to be net importers of capital and became net exporters instead.&lt;ref name = "wolf"/&gt;  Large inbound flows were directed  "uphill" from emerging economies to the US and other developed nations.&lt;ref name = "wolf"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Subra"/&gt; According to economist [[C.

&lt;/ref&gt;   By the second half of 2009, low interest rates and other aspects of the [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence|government led response]] to the global crises had resulted in increased movement of capital back towards emerging economies.&lt;ref name = "Baseline"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;   In November 2009 the [[Financial Times]] reported several emerging economies such as Brazil and India have begun to implement or at least signal the possible adoption of capital controls to reduce the flow of foreign capital into their economies.&lt;ref name = "hotMoney"/&gt;

'''César Guido Forcieri''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] lawyer, economist, politician, and businessman. He is currently the Executive Director for Argentina, [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Uruguay]] at [[The World Bank]].

Forcieri has been described as the right-hand man of [[Amado Boudou]], a leading member of the circle surrounding Argentinian President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]]. Boudou ran ANSES, Argentina’s national social-security administration, in 2008-9, was the country’s Minister of the Economy in 2009-11, and became Vice President of Argentina in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Alconada Mon| first =Hugo| title =En otros medios: Forcieri venía a declarar a la Argentina y en una escala del viaje decidió volver| work =TN| date =Jun 27, 2014| url =http://tn.com.ar/politica/en-otros-medios-forcieri-venia-a-declarar-a-la-argentina-y-en-una-escala-del-viaje-decidio-volver_510529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Boudou and Forcieri were investigated for corruption in early 2014 as part of the scandal known as “[[Boudougate]].”  

==Early life and education==
Forcieri attended [[Colegio De La Salle]] from 1985 to 1997 and earned a bachelor's degree. He attended [[Universidad Argentina de la Empresa]] from 2002 to 2006 and earned a degree in law. He attended [[Universidad del CEMA]] from 2007 to 2008 and earned a master's degree in Law and Finance.

In 2013-14 he attended [[Georgetown University]] and received a Certificate in International Business Management.&lt;ref name=link&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=197501501&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=VKyT&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=316103581404493359784&amp;srchindex=2&amp;srchtotal=2&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A316103581404493359784%2CVSRPtargetId%3A197501501%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 2006 to 2010, Forcieri held various offices at ANSES (Administración Nacional de la Seguridad Social), the Argentinian national social-security administration, including positions in the Technical and Administrative Department, Acquisitions and Public Contracts Office, and Wealth Fund for the Pension System (Fondo de Garantia de Sustentabilidad para el Sistema Integrado Previsional Argentino). He served as Liaison Manager of ANSES from May 2009 through April 2010.

In 2008, Forcieri formed the corporation Rock Argentina SA, which purportedly provides artistic and advertising services.

In May 2010, he was named Acting Chief of Staff at the Argentine Ministry of Economy and Public Finances, and was confirmed as Chief of Staff in August of that year. He was a Director of Quickfood SA in Buenos Aires from March 2010 to March 2011, and Undersecretary of Financial Services at the Argentinian Ministry of Economy and Public Finances from December 2011 to October 2012. He was a Director of Grupo Financiero Galicia S.A. in Buenos Aires from April 2011 to January 2013, having been appointed by Amado Boudou, then President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner’s Minister of Economy, to represent the interests of the State rather than those of private shareholders. From May 2010 to March 2014 he was G-20 Finance Deputy for Argentina at the Argentinian Ministry of Economy and Public Finances.

Since November 2012, Forcieri has been Executive Director for Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay at The World Bank in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=link/&gt;&lt;ref name=urg&gt;{{cite web| title =Exclusivo: Carrió hunde a mano derecha de Boudou | work =Urgente 24| date =Mar 27, 2012| url =http://www.urgente24.com/197068-exclusivo-carrio-hunde-a-mano-derecha-de-boudou?pagination=show }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Guido Forcieri| work =Forbes| url =https://www.forbes.com/profile/guido-forcieri/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =World Bank Executive Directors Directory| work =Bank Information Center| url =http://www.bicusa.org/resources/executive-directors/eds08a/#Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption charges and Boudougate==
Argentinian Congresswoman [[Elisa Carrió]] and Buenos Aires legislator [[Maximiliano Ferraro]] asked the Anti-Corruption Bureau in March 2012 to investigate Forcieri on charges of “conflicts of interest” and “inconsistencies in the public service.” The complaint noted that Forcieri was involved in Action Media AS and Rock Argentina SA, and maintained that he had used his position in government to obtain favorable loans for these companies, which had assets of only $12,000 and $20,000 respectively but received loans “in excess of $200,000 and $400,000.” The complaint further noted that Rock Argentina had not increased its capital since its founding in 2008. Carrió and Ferraro argued that it was inappropriate for a high official in the Ministry of Economy and Financial Services to be a founding partner of corporations with limited resources that received “generous” loans from banks. They underscored that both Rock Argentina and Action Media were officially chaired by Juan Carlos Lopez, who also chaired Real Estate Investments Aspen SA, a firm half-owned by Forcieri’s former boss Boudou.&lt;ref name=urg/&gt;

One of the charges in the complaint involved the firm Ciccone Calcográfica. Boudou was said to have inappropriately helped the firm in 2010 to free itself from bankruptcy by means of a payment plan that enabled it to be transferred to an investment fund allegedly linked to Boudou, and of then having enriched the firm with government contracts. These charges developed into the scandal known as “Boudougate.” Forcieri was said to have participated in the alleged illegal activities, and was specifically identified as having introduced Boudou to [[Jose María Núñez Carmona]], a central figure in the transactions under investigation. It was discovered that Forcieri, Núñez Carmona, and Boudou had traveled to [[Brazil]] in 2011 with [[Alejandro Vandenbroele]], chair of Calcográfica Ciccone and an official of a shell corporation called The Old Fund, which Boudou and Núñez Carmona were believed to have used to take control of Calcográfica Ciccone. Attempts to impeach Boudou failed because of the Kirchnerist majorities in both chambers of the Argentinian Congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/163068/forcieri-stays-in-dc
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diariopanorama.com/seccion/pais_16/guido-forcieri-vandenbroele-y-naoaez-carmona-viajaron-juntos-a-brasil-en-2011_a_175510
&lt;/ref&gt;

Forcieri was summoned to appear before Judge [[Ariel Lijo]] in June 2014 to answer questions about these matters, but he requested an extension on the grounds that he was doing “strategic” work at the World Bank in Washington. Lijo, who believed that Calcográfica Cicconi had printed ballots in the 2011 presidential election, thus suggesting that the company enjoyed close ties to the Kirchner regime, had earlier warned that if Forcieri did not appear to testify, she would consider requesting his arrest by U.S. authorities. After Forcieri made his request for a postponement, Lijo asked the World Bank and Ministry of Finance to confirm his claim that his professional activities prevented him from traveling to Argentina to testify. Carrió described Forcieri as a “key figure” in the investigation and asked in a radio interview how the region could have a representative at the World Bank who is under investigation for criminal offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =El juez Ariel Lijo aceptó postergar la indagatoria de Guido Forcieri| work =La Nacion| date =Jun 26, 2014| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1704696-ariel-lijo-guido-forcieri-caso-ciccone-declaracion-indagatoria-captura-internacional}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =El juez Ariel Lijo aceptó postergar la indagatoria de Guido Forcieri| work =Perfil| date =Jun 26, 2014| url =http://www.perfil.com/politica/El-juez-Ariel-Lijo-acepto-postergar-la-indagatoria-de-Guido-Forcieri-20140626-0007.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Lijo orders probe on Ciccone money trail| work =Buenos Aires Herald| date =Jun 13, 2014| url =http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/161954/lijo-orders-probe-on-ciccone-money-trail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferraro, charging that Boudou and Forcieri were plainly attempting to drag out the case, called on June 25 for Forcieri’s arrest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laprensa.com.ar/424465-UNEN-pide-que-la-Justicia-ordene-la-captura-internacional-de-Guido-Forcieri.note.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.continental.com.ar/noticias/actualidad/unen-pidio-la-captura-internacional-de-guido-forcieri/20140625/nota/2292267.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disney on Parade''', was a series of touring [[arena]] [[stage show|stage shows]] produced by NAWAL Productions, a [[joint venture]] between [[NBC]] and [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]]. Aimed primarily at children and families, the shows featured live performers portraying the roles of Disney characters in performances derived from various Disney films.

==History==
The initial idea for ''Disney on Parade'' was convinced by Thomas Sarnoff, youngest son of Robert Sarnoff. The elder Sarnoff had served as the president of NBC and CEO of [[RCA]]. &lt;ref name=Kober&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kober|first1=Jeff|title=Leading Disney on Parade|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/8678/Leading_Disney_on_Parade|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;NBC at the time aired Walt Disney Productions' [[Walt Disney anthology television series|weekly anthology series]]. To produce the show, Disney teamed with the network to create NAWAL Productions, with NBC being the [[general partner]] and Disney the limited partner.

Following a trial run in [[Long Beach, California]], the first edition of ''Disney on Parade'' launched in [[Chicago, Illinois]] on December 25, 1969 and was an instant success. However, the show suffered from an overabundance of props, inexperienced performers, high costs and a run time of nearly three hours, so NBC replaced producer [[Bob Jani]] with Michel M. Grilikhes, who made effective changes, including rearranging or removing acts, to reduce costs and time without affecting the show's quality. Grilikhes, affectionately known to the cast and crew as "Mr. G", would executive-produce and direct further editions of ''Disney on Parade''.&lt;ref name=Kober&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kober|first1=Jeff|title=Leading Disney on Parade|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/8678/Leading_Disney_on_Parade|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four editions of ''Disney on Parade'', each with a different set of acts, would tour across the United States and around the world, including runs in South America, Europe, Asia and Australia; a performance in [[Adelaide, Australia]] was videotaped and broadcast as a one-hour special on NBC's ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' in December 1971. By 1976, the shows ceased performing internationally.

==Format==
Each edition of ''Disney on Parade'' typically began with [[Mickey Mouse]] and a cavalcade of Disney characters dancing on the stage and personally greeting members of the audience. The show would then present lavish musical segments, depicting characters and scenes from Disney films, alongside smaller comedy routines with characters like [[Donald Duck]], [[Goofy]] and [[Herbie|Herbie the Love Bug]]. Finally, the characters appeared together for a grand finale and bid the audience farewell. Each show was divided into two acts with one 15-minute [[intermission]].

The arena stages typically sported a giant [[curtain]], from which characters and sets would emerge, and a circular motion picture screen that would present clips from Disney features and shorts at the beginning of major acts.

==Reception==
''Disney on Parade'' was well-received by audiences and critics. The first edition's run at [[Madison Square Garden]] made a record $400,000 in advanced ticket sales, and a run in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] booked 77,255 people in nine days, some 38% of the population. It later toured Europe, Australia, Asia and Latin America, making $64 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=Kober/&gt;

'''Ernest Dichter''' (14 August 1907 – 21 November 1991) was an American [[psychologist]] and [[marketing]] expert known as the "father of motivational research." Dichter pioneered the application of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] concepts and techniques to business — in particular to the study of [[consumer behaviour|consumer behavior]] in the marketplace. Ideas he established were a significant influence on the practices of the [[advertising]] industry in the twentieth century. Dichter promised the "mobilisation and manipulation of human needs as they exist in the consumer". As America entered the 1950s, the decade of heightened commodity fetishism, Dichter offered consumers moral permission to embrace sex and consumption, and forged a philosophy of corporate hedonism, which he thought would make people immune to dangerous totalitarian ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Christopher|title=The Hidden Persuader|journal=Cabinet|year=2012|volume=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Dichter was born to [[Austrian Jews|Jewish]] family on 14 August 1907 in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/advertising Jewish Virtual Library: "Modern Jewish History: Advertising"] retrieved May 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest of three sons of Wilhelm Dichter, a small businessman, and Mathilde Kurtz.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, A., "Introduction to the Transaction Edition," in ''The Strategy of Desire,'' [E-book edition], by Ernest Dichter, Routledge, 2017; Stern, B.B. "The Importance of Being Ernest: Commemorating Dichter's Contribution to Advertising Research," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June, 2004, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; His early education was interrupted due to the family's financial difficulties. However, by working part-time as a tutor, retail-store window decorator and other odd jobs, he was able to educate himself and attended the Sorbonne in Paris where he studied literature. He received his doctorate from the [[University of Vienna]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D., "The Birth of a Salesman: Ernest Dichter and the Objects of Desire," Horowitz, 1986; also available as an unpublished paper at unpublished paper, available at Hagley Museum, &lt;Online: https://www.hagley.org/sites/default/files/HOROWITZ_DICHTER.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, he gained some experience in market research working for the Psychoeconomic Institute in Vienna where he was part of a team that carried out research into the milk-drinking habits of the Viennese; a project where he was exposed to depth interviews for the first time. In 1934, he married Hedy Langfelder, a concert pianist and piano teacher. In 1937, while working at the Institute, Dichter was arrested and interrogated for four weeks. After being released, he learned that his name had been added to a list of subversives. He realised that as a Jew with a record as a subversive, it would be virtually impossible to find work in Vienna. He and his wife fled to Paris, but soon realised that France was also a dangerous place for a Jewish family. The couple left Europe permanently, arriving in New York in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ernest Dichter and Motivation Research: New Perspectives on the Making of Post-war Consumer Culture|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-0-230-53799-6|editor1=Schwarzkopf, Stefan |editor2=Gries, Rainer |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D., "The Birth of a Salesman: Ernest Dichter and the Objects of Desire," Horowitz, 1986; also available as an unpublished paper at unpublished paper, available at Hagley Museum, &lt;Online: https://www.hagley.org/sites/default/files/HOROWITZ_DICHTER.pdf&gt;; Stern, B.B. "The Importance of Being Ernest: Commemorating Dichter's Contribution to Advertising Research," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June, 2004, pp 165-169&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

In 1939, soon after arriving in the US, Dichter sent out a [[cover letter]] describing himself as: "a young psychologist from Vienna ... with some interesting new ideas which can help you be more successful, effective, sell more and communicate better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Retail therapy. How Ernest Dichter, an acolyte of Sigmund Freud, revolutionised marketing |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21541706 |quote=In 1939 he wrote to six big American companies, introducing himself as 'a young psychologist ... |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=December 17, 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his first clients was the Compton Agency who invited him to work on a campaign for [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory Soap]], a [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] product. In that project, Dichter relied on depth interviews where people talked about their experience of bathing. This method, which resembled the techniques used by [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]], contrasted sharply with the [[quantitative marketing research]] methods in use at the time. Dichter demonstrated that bathing had an erotic element -- "one of the few occasions when the Puritanical American was allowed to caress himself or herself." Dichter arrived at the insight that bathing was more than just a physical cleansing, but also a psychological cleansing. This insight gave rise to a new campaign slogan: "Be Smart and Get a Fresh Start with Ivory Soap."&lt;ref&gt;Dichter, E., ''Getting Motivated,'' pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also hired by [[Chrysler]] Corporation to help sell [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth cars]]. In that project, Dichter offered two key insights. One was that women play an important role in influencing men's purchasing decisions. His interviews also revealed the importance of the convertible. People, especially middle-aged men, connected emotionally with sports cars which reminded them of their youth and freedom. Although convertibles accounted for less than 2% of sales, they had symbolic significance in the showroom. Dichter likened the convertible to a mistress, while the sedate, comfortable sedan which most people purchased was associated with a wife. Among Dichter's recommendations to Chrysler was that the company advertise in women's magazines, a move that was highly successful.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D., "The Birth of a Salesman: Ernest Dichter and the Objects of Desire," unpublished paper, available at Hagley Museum, &lt;Online: https://www.hagley.org/sites/default/files/HOROWITZ_DICHTER.pdf&gt;, pp 16-17;Karmasin, H., "Ernest Dichter’s Studies on Automobile Marketing," in Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R. (eds.), ''Ernest Dichter and Motivation Research: New Perspectives on the Making of Post-war Consumer Culture, Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 109-125&lt;/ref&gt;

Dichter's work on the Chrysler campaign caught the attention of the US trade press who picked up on the story of the wife or mistress. ''Time'' magazine also followed with a detailed story of Dichter and his methods. According to ''Time'' Dichter was "the first to apply to advertising the really scientific psychology."  &lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D., "The Birth of a Salesman: Ernest Dichter and the Objects of Desire," unpublished paper, available at Hagley Museum, &lt;Online: https://www.hagley.org/sites/default/files/HOROWITZ_DICHTER.pdf&gt;,pp 16-17; ''Time,'' 25 March 1940, pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; This media coverage launched Dichter's career, just eighteen months after he had arrived in the US.

Dichter also carried out the research that led to the famous slogan for [[Esso]]/[[ExxonMobil|Exxon]]. The slogan, "Put a tiger in your tank" was built around the insight that consumers associate motor vehicles with power.&lt;ref&gt;''Adage,'' "Ernest Dichter," &lt;Online: http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/dichter-ernest-1907-1991/98623/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 he founded the Institute for Motivational Research in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York]], later named Ernest Dichter and Associates and moved his home to Peekskill in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D.G.B. and Tadajewski, M., (eds), ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; In the succeeding years, he founded similar institutes in Switzerland and Germany. Between the late 1930s and the 1960s, Dichter worked on hundreds of advertising campaigns, packaging ideas and product designs - from cake mixes to typewriters.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R. (eds.), ''Ernest Dichter and Motivation Research: New Perspectives on the Making of Post-war Consumer Culture, Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

Dichter borrowed techniques used in psychology; depth interviews, [[projective technique]]s and [[Observational techniques|observational research]] methods and applied them in new ways.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, B.B., "Literary Criticism and the History of Marketing Thought: A New Perspective on 'Reading' Marketing Theory," ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 18, No. 4, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than use these methods to treat neuroses, he used them to understand unconsciously held beliefs and attitudes that help to explain why people behave in certain ways. To do this, he gathered together small groups whose members were typical of the target audience and interviewed them to uncover their desires and predispositions to a product or brand. He called these groups ''focus groups.'' &lt;ref&gt;Page, E., "Ernest Dichter, 84, a Consultant On Consumer Motivation, Is Dead," [Obituary], ''New York Times,'' 23 November 1991 &lt;Online:https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/23/nyregion/ernest-dichter-84-a-consultant-on-consumer-motivation-is-dead.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to standard market research methods of the time which sought to quantify ''what'' consumers were doing, Dichter was interested in ''why'' consumers made given purchase decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R.J., "Is it true what they say about motivation research?" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 22, October, 1957, pp 125–133&lt;/ref&gt;

An oft-cited example of Dichter's studies is an understanding of why people use cigarette lighters. The conscious explanation is that lighters are used to light cigarettes, but at a deeper, unconscious level people use lighters because it gives them mastery and power.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, A., "Introduction to the Transaction Edition," in ''The Strategy of Desire,'' [E-book edition], by Ernest Dichter, Routledge, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; "The capacity to summon fire inevitably gives every human being, child or grownup the sense of power. Reasons go far back into man's history... the ability to control fire is an age-old symbol of man's conquest of the physical world." &lt;ref&gt;Dichter, E., ''The Strategy of Desire,'' 1964, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

Dichter's work was central to the development of the idea of brand image.&lt;ref&gt;"Ernest Dichter," ''Transatlantic Perspectives,'' 2018, &lt;Online: http://www.transatlanticperspectives.org/entry.php?rec=18&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1998 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', he "was the first to coin the term [[focus group]] and to stress the importance of product image and persuasion in advertising".&lt;!--Dichter is credited with originating the [[Exxon]] slogan "Put a tiger in your tank" in collaboration with Chicago advertising copywriter [[Frederick D. Sulcer]].--&gt; In [[Vance Packard]]'s book on Dichter and his practices, Packard recalls meeting Dichter in his castle and finding children watching televisions while resident psychologists, crouching behind special screens secretly filmed and studied their every action so that they could inform advertisers how to manipulate their unconscious minds. Dichter called such focus groups his "living laboratory". One such session led to the invention of the [[Barbie]] Doll: "What they wanted was someone sexy looking, someone that they wanted to grow up to be like," Dichter reported, "Long legs, big breasts, glamorous." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Packard|first=Vance|title=''The Hidden Persuaders''|year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dichter's reputation fluctuated throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;''Adage,'' "Ernest Dichter," Online: http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/dichter-ernest-1907-1991/98623/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vance Packard]] attacked the ethics of his methods in the book, ''The Hidden Persuaders'' (1956). Packard's book argued that many consumers "are being influenced and manipulated far more than we realize in the patterns of our everyday lives." Packard compared Dichter's methods to "the chilling world of George Orwell and his Big Brother." &lt;ref&gt;Page, E., "Ernest Dichter, 84, a Consultant On Consumer Motivation, Is Dead," [Obituary], ''New York Times,'' 23 November 1991 &lt;Online:https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/23/nyregion/ernest-dichter-84-a-consultant-on-consumer-motivation-is-dead.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To Packard, Dichter's gothic mansion was a sinister factory that manufactured and implanted self-destructive desires. The popularity of Packard's book left the general public with a deep suspicion about market research methods.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, M.T., "The Hidden Persuaders: Then and Now," ''Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 37, no. 1, 2008, DOI: 10.2753/JOA0091-3367370109, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, Dichter and the subject of motivation research were rarely mentioned in the scholarly literature.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, B.B. "The Importance of Being Ernest: Commemorating Dichter's Contribution to Advertising Research," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June, 2004, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have questioned whether Dichter was truly responsible for the development of motivational research or whether he was its greatest proponent.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzkopf, Stefan, "Ernest Dichter, Motivation Research and the ‘Century of the Consumer’" in Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R. (eds.), ''Ernest Dichter and Motivation Research: New Perspectives on the Making of Post-war Consumer Culture, Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 4; Fullerton, R., "Ernest Dichter: The Motivational Researcher," in Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R. (eds.), ''Ernest Dichter and Motivation Research: New Perspectives on the Making of Post-war Consumer Culture, Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 58; Tadajewski, M., "Remembering Motivation Research: Toward an Alternative Genealogy of Interpretive Consumer Research", ''Marketing Theory,'' vol. 6, 2006, p. 433, DOI: 10.1177/1470593106069931, [http://mtq.sagepub.com/content/6/4/429 Online]&lt;/ref&gt; This questioninng is based on the insight that the field of motivational research was already well developed prior to Dichter's arrival in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Tadajewski, M., "Remembering Motivation Research: Toward an Alternative Genealogy of Interpretive Consumer Research," ''Marketing Theory,'' Vol.6, No. 4, 2006, pp 429-466, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/1470593106069931; Tadajewski, M., "Ernest Dichter and Consumer Behaviour: Intellectual Primacy and Interpretive Consumer Research," in Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R.

'''Fibre modification''' is a research field in which researchers aim at developing and applying technologies to impart new properties to natural fibres such as those in [[paper]], in order to increase their functionality. Research areas in this field include many different technologies, amongst which the chemical modifications of fibres are widely used. One important sector of application of the chemical modifications is the treatment of [[wood]] for giving it enhanced properties such as higher mechanical properties, water impermeability, less [[hygroscopic]]ity, bacterial and fungal resistance. Transferring and adapting the technical knowledge on fibre modification available for the wood sector to the recycled paper sector is an innovative use of these chemical treatments which has been the subject of studies that have been carried out within an EU co-funded project called Fibre+.&lt;ref&gt;7th Framework Program – SME-AGs funding scheme – Grant Agreement n° 315633 – http://www.fibreplus.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The project Consortium included members representing Paper and Packaging European Associations ([[Confederation of European Paper Industries|CEPI]], FEFCO), and research institutes specialized in the wood and paper for [[packaging industry|packaging sector]] and paper and packaging companies. The focus of the project was on chemical modification of the paper made recycled fibres, investigating the possibility to transfer wood fibre modifications technique from the wood sector to paper and packaging sector. The aim was to enhance the properties of papers and of the packaging, as the recycling process causes the deterioration of fibres.

The chemical modification of recycled fibres aimed at the creation of a new generation of packaging papers characterized for being more recyclable, less hygroscopic, stiff and durable. The high [[recycling]] rate of papers in Europe (which is at the level of 72%) and the consequent importance that recycling has for the circular economy, were at the basis of this study. Paper products form part of an integrated carbon cycle based on the [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] conversion of water, [[carbon dioxide]], nutrients and solar energy into renewable wood-based [[biomass]]. Once consumed, paper may be recovered and used again either as a source of secondary fibres, to produce recycled paper or as [[bio-fuel]]. Fibre packages or corrugated containers made from [[corrugated board]] were the ones that were dealt with in the project, as they are considered as being the most prominent structural application of paper.

==Chemical modification attempts==

Fibre modification with chemicals or [[enzyme]]s had been investigated in the production of [[fibreboard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krzysik, A.M., J.A. Youngquist, R.M. Rowell, J.H. Muehl, P. Chow and S.R. Shook|year= 1993|title=Feasibility of using recycled newspapers as a fiber source for dry-process hardboards|journal=For. Prod. J.|volume=43|pages=53–58|url=https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/6276892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gomez-Bueso et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Fibre modification applying steam (steam-exploded wood) has been proved an efficient pre-treatment method in producing [[thermoplastic]] composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Takatani, M., Itoh, H,. Ohsugi, S,. Kitayama, T., Saegusa, M., Kawai, S. and Okamoto, T.|year=2000|title=Effect of lignocellulosic material on the properties of thermoplastic polymer/wood composites,
|journal=Holzforschung 
|volume=54
|pages=197–200
|doi=10.1515/HF.2000.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Current theories for interfibre bonding during papermaking process are based on general recognition of the [[hydrogen bonding]] model. Consequently, all effort for boosting fibre strength is connected to mechanical beating of fibres in order to generate more flexible and fragmented fibres for increased bonding areas. As a consequence, significant drawbacks are obtained in terms of water retention ratio resulting in poor dewatering behaviour and high energy consumption. New mechanisms for interpretation and control of interfibre bonding are still upcoming. One way to overcome these drawbacks could be the molecular coating of [[cellulose]] fibres using [[polymer]]s targeted on [[entropy]] controlled mixing of polymers and cellulose gel resulting in higher bonding forces. Theoretical results as well as experimental data on how application of polymeric layers (e.g. [[carboxymethyl cellulose]]) and enzymes on cellulose fibres can lead to sheets of high bonding strength without any mechanical beating have been already presented.&lt;ref&gt;Laine at al. 2002, Gustavsson 2003, Danielsson 2006, Erhard 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these attempts were still far from any industrial implementation and their application would have been costly and would not solve the problem of raw material availability.

==Objective==

Based on this state-of-the-art, the objective of the project was to modify and thus improve the characteristics of different types of recovered fibres used for the production of a variety of packaging grade papers used as linerboard and corrugating medium for corrugated board manufacturing in Europe. Information on the actual furnish characteristics and composition of packaging materials is expected to help European packaging industry to evaluate its sources of supply and to adopt suitable methods and processes to improve the available resources in an optimal manner. In the case of packaging, scientific technical knowledge of practical industrial relations between fibre characteristics, paper properties and corrugated board properties also is needed.

From wood fibre modification to paper technology chemical wood modification aims at altering the structure of the cell wall matrix. Wood
properties are improved considerably by converting [[hydrophilic]] OH-groups into larger more [[hydrophobic]] groups. Also the physical fixation of modifying chemicals in the cell wall matrix can considerably change the wood properties. In addition to a hydrophobing effect, the treatments reduce the volume of [[cell wall]] nano-pores and thus decrease the incorporation of water molecules into the cell wall matrix. On a macroscopic scale, wood modification can change important properties of the wood including biological durability (resistance against fungi), dimensional stability, [[hardness]] and [[UV-stability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hill CAS|year=2006|title=Wood modification. Chemical, thermal and other processes|publisher=Wiley, Chichester|isbn=978-0-470-02172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since paper is produced from wood fibres, it was possible to transfer some of the developments achieved in wood technology to paper technology. Several technologies (e.g. chemical modification, nano-scale celluloses, [[polyelectrolyte]]s, functional polymers based on cellulose, [[hemicellulose]]s and [[starch]]) were researched and used by different research groups around Europe (e.g. PTS and [[University of Goettingen]], Germany; [[Kungliga Tekniska högskolan]] (KTH), Sweden.) There is already well established knowledge on chemical fibre modification of recycled fibres. Adamopoulos and Mai (2011) modified recycled fibres with N-methylol compounds and [[glutaraldehyde]] with significant improvement on fibre characteristics and paper sheet performance.&lt;ref&gt;Adamopoulos and Mai (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory sheets manufactured with a variety of chemically modified recycled fibres were found to be superior in stiffness and hygroscopic properties than these manufactured from unmodified ones.&lt;ref&gt;Adamopoulos et al. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of the Fibre+ project is to build on the existing knowledge on fibre modification for adapting, implementing and disseminating this innovative technology in European paper SMEs.

Results of the Fibre+ project on recycled fibres for packaging paper and information on potential developments of the Fibre+ concept can be found on the Fibre+ website including scientific articles that have been published as a consequence of the RTD work that has been carried out during the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hosseinpourpia, R., Adamopoulos, S. and C.

'''Global labor arbitrage''' is an economic phenomenon where, as a result of the removal of or disintegration of [[Trade barrier|barriers]] to [[international trade]], jobs move to nations where labor and the cost of doing business (such as [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]]) is inexpensive and/or impoverished labor moves to nations with higher paying jobs.&lt;ref name=Whitney&gt;The "global labor arbitrage" phenomenon has been described by economist [[Stephen S. Roach]]. See Mike Whitney, [http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/147390483.html "Labor arbitrage,"] ''Entrepreneur'', June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two common barriers to international trade are [[tariff]]s (politically imposed) and the costs of transporting goods across oceans.  With the advent of the [[Internet]], the decrease of the costs of [[telecommunications]], and the possibility of near-instantaneous document transfer, the barriers to the trade of intellectual work product, which is essentially, any kind of work that can be performed on a computer (such as [[computer programming]]) or that makes use of a college education, have been greatly reduced.

Often, a prosperous nation (such as the [[United States]]) will remove its barriers to international trade, integrating its [[labor market]] with those of nations with a lower cost of labor (such as [[India]], [[China]], and [[Mexico]]), resulting in a shifting of jobs from the prosperous nation to the developing one. The end result is an increase in the supply of labor relative to the demand for labor, which means a decrease in costs and a decrease in wages.

==Forms of global labor arbitrage==
Global labor arbitrage can take many forms, including but not limited to:

Capital moves to nations with cheap labor, lower taxes and or fewer environmental regulations or other costs of doing business for the purpose of producing goods and services for export to other markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miszczynski|first=Milosz|date=2016-06-22|title=Labour arbitrage: the lifecycle of a global production node|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JOE-04-2016-0009|journal=Journal of Organizational Ethnography|volume=5|issue=2|pages=106–122|doi=10.1108/JOE-04-2016-0009|issn=2046-6749}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classic example is the case of a factory or office closing in Nation A and then moving to Nation B for the purpose of producing goods or services at lower labor costs for export back to Nation A's market. This can result in layoffs for workers in Nation A. For example, in the United States, the amount of manufacturing jobs has decreased while the importation of manufactured goods from other nations has increased (along with the United States' trade deficit). These trends are now affecting the service sector as well.&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/Nadeem_Global-Networks.pdf "The Uses and Abuses of Time: Globalization and Time Arbitrage in India’s Outsourcing Industries,"] ''[[Global Networks]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importation of foreign labor using work visas===
Labor, often skilled and educated, moves to a nation on a temporary or permanent basis.  This has the effect of increasing the supply of labor in that nation's market.

This type of labor importation may be advantageous. According to the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), a registered [[political action committee]],&lt;ref name="Open Secrets NVCA"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Venture Capital Assn|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00150367|publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]]|accessdate=8 June 2015|quote=FEC Committee ID: C00150367}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 25% of all [[Startup company|startups]] responding to an NVCA survey, in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] of the US in the last 15 years were "immigrant-founded" (most likely former or current [[H-1B]]s).&lt;ref name = NFAP&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Stuart|title=American Made:  The Impact of Immigrant Entrepreneurs and Professionals on U.S. Competitiveness|url=http://www.nfap.com/researchactivities/studies/immigrant_entreprenuers_professionals_november_2006.pdf|publisher=National Venture Capital Association|accessdate=22 July 2012|author2=Michaela Platzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; 40% of all publicly traded and venture founded companies in high tech manufacturing were started by immigrants. These account for more than half of all jobs in this sector.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = To conduct the research, we examined the Thomson Financial database of all publicly traded venture-backed companies founded since 1970. After eliminating those that had merged, been acquired, or were otherwise no longer publicly traded (or in business), we used public records, Internet research, e-mails, and phone calls to identify the nativity of the founders for the nearly 900 remaining companies.4 The companies on our final list of immigrant-founded U.S. publicly traded venture-backed companies had at least one immigrant founder.

Conversely, the NVCA "American Made," publication makes little mention of US born co-founders, makes an errant claim that Intel has an immigrant founder,&lt;ref name="Grove Not a Founder"/&gt; resulting in a faulty claim of the following companies employing more than 245,000 people in 2005:&lt;ref name = NFAP/&gt;

* [[Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems (1982-2010)]] (co-founders: [[Vinod Khosla]]-India, [[Andy Bechtolsheim]]-Germany, [[Bill Joy]]-US, [[Scott McNealy]]-US)

* [[Yahoo!]] (co-founders: [[David Filo]]-US, [[Jerry Yan]]-Taiwan)
* [[eBay]] (founder: [[Pierre Omidyar]]-France)

Previous studies authored by Stuart Anderson, of the National Foundation for American Policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.nfap.com/about/biographies/|work=Biographies|publisher=National Foundation for American Policy|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  had been careful to make the distinction of, "...founded or co-founded..." whereas the National Venture Capital Association uses the term, "immigrant-founded" 55 times in its 39-page document. The publication's data tables disclose only the names of "immigrant-born founder or cofounder", American born co-founders, and the number of American co-founders, are omitted.&lt;ref name = NFAP/&gt; Additionally, according to [[Intel]] Corporation (99,900 employees), Hungarian born CEO [[Andy Grove]] was not an Intel co-founder.&lt;ref name="Grove Not a Founder"&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel Facts|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/company-overview/company-facts.html|work=Answers to our most frequent questions|publisher=[[Intel]]|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===
Impoverished labor moves towards capital in prosperous nations.  This tends to increase the supply of labor relative to capital in the prosperous nations and potentially decreases wages, according to the laws of supply and demand (of and for labor). However, this decrease can be offset by job creation due to talented immigrants, as discussed in the last section.

In [[accountancy|accounting]], '''gross profit''', '''gross margin''', '''sales profit''', or '''credit sales''' is the difference between [[revenue]] and the cost of making a product or providing a service, before deducting [[overhead (business)|overhead]]s, [[payroll]], [[taxation]], and [[interest]] payments. This is different from [[earnings before interest and taxes|operating profit]] (earnings before interest and taxes). [[Gross margin]] is the term normally used in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horngren|first=Charles|author-link=Charles Thomas Horngren|title=Accounting, 9th Edition|date=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458|isbn=0132569051}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''gross profit'' is the more common usage in the UK and Australia.

The various deductions (and their corresponding metrics) leading from [[net sales]] to [[net income]] are as follows:
:[[Net sales]] = [[gross sales]] – (customer discounts + returns + allowances)
:Gross profit = [[net sales]] – [[cost of goods sold]]
:Gross profit percentage = [([[net sales]] – [[cost of goods sold]])/[[net sales]]] × 100%.
:[[Operating profit]] = gross profit – total [[operating expense]]s
:[[Net income]] (or [[net profit]]) = [[operating profit]] – taxes – interest

(Note: [[Cost of goods sold]] is calculated differently for a [[merchandising]] business than for a [[manufacturing|manufacturer]].)

The '''Hallidie Building''' is an office building in the [[Financial District, San Francisco, California|Financial District]] of [[San Francisco, California]], at 130 [[Sutter Street]], between [[Montgomery Street]] and [[Kearny Street]]. It was built around 1917-1918 and though credited as the first American building to feature [[glass]] [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]]s,&lt;ref name="greatbuildings"&gt;{{cite web

The building was designed by architect [[Willis Polk]] and is named in honor of San Francisco cable car pioneer [[Andrew Smith Hallidie]]. Currently, it houses the San Francisco chapters of the [[American Institute of Architects]], [[AIGA]], One Medical, Center for Architecture + Design, the US Green Building Council - Northern California Chapter, Charles M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3817">'''Income Computation and Disclosure Standards''' ('''ICDS''') were issued by the [[Government of India]] in exercise of powers conferred to it under section 145(2) of [[The Income Tax Act, 1961]].

The [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]] published 14 draft ICDS, out of which 10 ICDS were notified by the government on 31 March 2015. The government specified a deferment of one year from the date of implementation of these standards; the notified ICDS will be applicable from the financial year 2016-17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Documents/Notification-86-87-88-2016.pdf|title=CBDT Notification No.88|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icai.org/new_post.html?post_id=12759&amp;c_id=219|title=ICAI - The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India|website=ICAI|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICDS were issued with the aim of bringing uniformity in accounting policies governing computation of income in accordance with tax related provisions, and also reducing the irregularities amongst them. The ICDS were developed using [[Generally accepted accounting principles|Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAPs) with assistance from the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]].

The [[Form 3CD]] (Tax Audit Report) is already been revised for making mandatory disclosures in compliance with ICDS.

== History ==
The [[Taxation in India#Central Board of Direct Taxes|Central Board of Direct Taxes]] (CBDT) formed an Accounting Standards Committee which had earlier issued draft of 14 Tax Accounting Standards in 2012. On the basis of suggestions and comments received from stakeholders, CBDT revised and issued a 12 draft ICDS for public opinion. On 31 March 2015 the government issued 10 out of those 12 drafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Lists/Press%20Releases/Attachments/407/Press-Release-ICDS-26-11-2015.pdf|title=CBDT Press Release|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applicability ==
ICDS are to be followed by all [[assesse]]s, except individual or [[Hindu Undivided Family]] who are not covered under [[tax audit]] provisions, following [[Mercantile System]] of accounting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Documents/Notifica&lt;/ref&gt;

== Miscellaneous provisions ==
* For the sake of be-verity and for the ease of tax payers, the notification provided several transitional provisions for the purpose of application of ICDS.
* Noncompliance of ICDS could result in best judgement assessment by tax authorities, which may lead to protracted litigations.

'''Isaiah Emmanuel Morter''' (sometimes spelled '''Isiah''') (1860 &amp;ndash; 7 April 1924) was born in 1860 in the Freetown district of [[Belize]]. He was of [[Igbo people|Igbo]] descent (some say his parents were [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] royalty)&lt;ref&gt;Peter David Ashdown, ''Garveyism in Belize'', 1990, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; coming from a line of slaves brought to America from Nigeria. [[Marcus Garvey]] wrote that "[[Morter]] grew up fighting the oppositions and difficulties generally surrounding one born to his condition, until he lifted himself to the highest pinnacle of service to his race and to his country."&lt;ref&gt;Garvey, Marcus, "A tribute to the late Sir Isaiah Morter", ''Philosophy and opinions of March Garvey'', vol. 2, [[Amy Jacques Garvey]], 1977, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By planting and growing bananas and coconuts, Morter built a fortune and is widely regarded as Belize's first coloured [[millionaire]]. His nicknames included "the Coconut King" and "Guinea Sigar"&lt;ref&gt;''The Marcus Garvey and Universal Negro Improvement Association Papers'', Volume ... by [[Robert A. Hill (Jamaican historian)|Robert A. Hill]], John Dixon, Mariela Haro Rodriguez, Anthony Yuen, 2011, p. 639.&lt;/ref&gt; and he owned [[Caye Chapel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=vicky&lt;!-- #title --&gt; |url=http://amandala.com.bz/news/ashcroft-sells-caye-chapel-us30-mil/ |title=Ashcroft sells Caye Chapel for US$30 mil &amp;#124; Amandala Newspaper |publisher=Amandala.com.bz |date=2013-08-30 |accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other plantations.

Morter died on 7 April 1924.

'''Judgment summons''', in [[English law]], a summons issued under the [[Debtors' Act of 1869|Debtors' Act 1869]],&lt;ref&gt;Regnal 32 &amp; 33 Vic., c. 62&lt;/ref&gt; on the application of a creditor who has obtained a judgment for the payment of a sum of money by instalments or otherwise, where the order for payment has not been complied with. The [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] summons cites the defendant to appear personally in court, and be examined on oath as to the means he has, or has had, since the date of the order or judgment made against him, to pay the same, and to show cause why he should not be committed to prison for his default. An order of commitment obtained in a judgment summons remains in force for a year only, and the extreme term of imprisonment is six weeks, dating from the time of lodging in prison.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Judgment Summons |volume=15 |page=541 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[debtor]] has once been imprisoned, although for a period of less than six weeks, no second order of commitment can be made against him in respect of the same debt. But if the judgment be for payment by instalments a power of committal arises on default of payment for each instalment.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

However, if an order of commitment has never been executed, or becomes inoperative through lapse of time, a fresh commitment may be made.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Imprisonment does not operate as a satisfaction or extinguishment of a debt, or deprive a person of a right of execution against the land or goods of the person imprisoned in the same manner as there had been no imprisonment.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;  In this regard the judgement summons procedure may be seen as a more extreme—because of the threat of imprisonment—version of the procedure under the [[Civil Procedure Rules]]&lt;ref&gt;CPR Part 71&lt;/ref&gt; procedure to obtain information from judgment debtors.

A judgment summons may now be served by post in keeping with other [[Civil Procedure Rules]] actions but, if this option is chosen, then a commitment order cannot be obtained unless: (a) he appears at the hearing; or (b) it is made under section 110(2) of the [[County Courts Act 1984|Act]].&lt;ref&gt;CCR O. 28 r. 2(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications for these are now made under [[County Court]] rules Order 28.  There is a standard Civil Procedure Rules practice form&lt;ref&gt;Form N342&lt;/ref&gt; which may be used to apply for the issue of the summons.  The current fee for issue is £100.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Fees Guide EX50 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2436">'''Karena Albers''' is co-ounder of [[Whole World Water]], a social enterprise that unites the hospitality &amp; tourism industry to raise money for the nearly billion people that live without clean and safe drinking water, and co-founder of [[New York City|New York]]-based production company [[kontentreal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planet-mag.com/2010/greenspace/nika-knight/earth-awards Planet Mag]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Week"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/images/ss/07/06/0602_serial_entp/source/5.htm Business Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business life==
Albers launched her own marketing company, Integrated Marketing International, which was later acquired by [[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="Business Week"/&gt;  

Following this, Albers’ co-founded kontentreal in 2003 with Tad Fettig, which has produced films for [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and the [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]].&lt;ref name="Business Week"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/e2/about.html PBS]&lt;/ref&gt; kontentreal debuted its first episodic series on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], ''e² design'', in the summer of 2006.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

==kontentreal==
Headquartered in [[New York City]], and the brainchild of Tad Fettig and Karena Albers, kontentreal produces documentaries that raise awareness of global environmental issues. Both were veterans of the advertising world — Fettig as a commercial cinematographer specializing in rigorous location shoots for clients including [[Levi's]] and [[The North Face]], Albers out of [[DDB Worldwide]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mil/features/video_keeping_green/ Digital Content Producer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Whole World Water==
Launched in 2013, [[Whole World Water]] originated from a collective of creative thinkers who were seeking sustainable solutions for the hospitality and tourism industry. An idea emerged where if hotels, restaurants and spas filtered their own local water, bottled in reusable glass bottles, sold it to their guests and donated part of the proceeds to the Whole World Water Fund, they would not only be raising money for the billion people that do not have access to clean and safe drinking water, they would also be improving their bottom line.

He also served briefly as a member of the [[Japanese House of Councillors|House of Councillors]] in the [[Diet of Japan]]. His real name was Ōhashi Katsumi (大橋 克巳).&lt;ref&gt;[http://secondlife.yahoo.co.jp/life/master/profile/b101okyos.html profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205042553/http://secondlife.yahoo.co.jp/life/master/profile/b101okyos.html |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Sumida, Tokyo]], he grew up in [[Chiba prefecture]] and dropped out of the [[Waseda University]]. Declaring "semi-retirement", he then spent most of his time outside Japan, particularly in [[Canada]] during the summer, as well as in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] during the winter in the northern hemisphere, in which he ran his "OK Gift Shop" (OK stands for '''O'''hashi '''K'''yosen).

When he resigned in the House of Councillors, Ōhashi was succeeded by [[Marutei Tsurunen]], the first European-descended and openly [[foreign-born Japanese]] person to serve in the Diet.

'''Lillian Pulitzer Rousseau''' (born '''Lillian Lee McKim'''; November 10, 1931 – April 7, 2013), better known as '''Lilly Pulitzer''', was an [[Americans|American]] [[socialite]] and [[fashion designer]]. She founded '''Lilly Pulitzer, Inc.''', which produces clothing and other such wares featuring bright, colorful, floral prints. As the brand is popular with [[high society (group)|high society]], she was called the "Queen of [[preppy|Prep]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/columnists/lilly-pulitzer-dubbed-queen-of-prep-at-lisa-1117021.html|title=Lilly Pulitzer dubbed ‘Queen of Prep’ at Lisa Birnbach book-signing|work=Palm Beach Daily News|accessdate=May 17, 2011|date=Dec 13, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017221854/http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/columnists/lilly-pulitzer-dubbed-queen-of-prep-at-lisa-1117021.html|archivedate=October 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sentinel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-04-04/features/fl-fashion-column-040410-20100404_1_lilly-style-monkeys-lori-j-durante|title=Wanted: Dancing pink monkeys|work=[[Sun Sentinel]]|date=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

==Early life==
Lillian Lee "Lilly" McKim was born to socialites Robert V. McKim and his wife, [[Lillian Bostwick Phipps|Lillian (née Bostwick)]] in [[Roslyn, New York]] in 1931, the middle daughter of three. Her elder sister was named Mary Maude, and her younger sister was Florence Fitch. Her mother, Lillian Bostwick McKim was an heiress to the [[Standard Oil]] fortune. Robert and Lillian McKim divorced, and Lillian remarried, to [[Ogden Phipps]], in 1937.

She attended the [[Chapin School (Manhattan)|Chapin School]] in [[New York City]], along with [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Lee Bouvier]] (the future Jacqueline Kennedy, [[First Lady of the United States]]). In 1949, she graduated from [[Miss Porter's School]] in [[Farmington, Connecticut]]. She attended the college-finishing school [[Finch College]] in New York City, but left after one semester to work as a midwife assistant with [[Frontier Nursing Service]] in Kentucky {according to townandcountrymag.com} and as a volunteer at the Veterans Hospital in [[The Bronx]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Career==
Born to an heiress of the Standard Oil fortune, she married Herbert Pulitzer Jr. (known as Peter), the grandson of [[Joseph Pulitzer]]; the publisher and founder of the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Lilly and husband Peter Pulitzer settled in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], shortly after their marriage. They owned several [[Florida]] [[citrus]] [[orange (fruit)|orange]] [[grove (nature)|grove]]s and, with produce from the groves, she opened a fruit juice stand on [[Via Mizner]], just off [[Worth Avenue]] in Palm Beach. While working at the stand, Pulitzer found that squeezing juice made a mess of her clothes. Seeking to camouflage the juice stains, she designed a sleeveless shift [[dress]] made of bright, colorful printed cotton. She discovered that customers loved her dress, so she produced more to sell  at her juice stand. Eventually, she was selling more dresses than juice, and decided to focus on designing and selling what had become known as her "Lillys".&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1080933/index.htm|title=Lilly Fashions Her Own Kind Of Pulitzer Prize|last=Lieder|first=Ruth|date=March 11, 1968|work=SI Vault|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1959, Pulitzer became president of her own company, Lilly Pulitzer, Inc. The company's main factory was in [[Miami, Florida]] and the fabrics were produced by the Key West Hand Print Fabrics company in [[Key West]].&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt; From the 1960s to the early 1980s, Pulitzer's bright, colorful clothes were very popular, worn by elites such as [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], [[Caroline Kennedy]], and members of the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefeller]], [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilt]] and [[Whitney family|Whitney]] families.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;  Lilly Pulitzer was a former classmate of Jackie's. After Jackie was featured in [[Life magazine]] donning one of Lilly's famous shifts, many preppy ladies followed her lead. The Jacqueline dress is one of Lilly Pulitzer's most successful styles. By 1984, Lilly closed down the entire clothing operation.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;
Lilly later stated that the first shift dress her former classmate, [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] was photographed in, was made of kitchen curtains.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lillypulitzer.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=OurStory&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival of the brand===
In 1993, the rights to the brand were purchased by Sugartown Worldwide, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4339226|title=Sugartown Worldwide, Inc. Company Overview|work=BusinessWeek.com|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contacted Pulitzer with the hopes of reviving the brand because, "they just loved Lilly, their mothers and sisters loved Lilly, and they wanted to bring the line back," Pulitzer said.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/111988959.html?dids=111988959:111988959&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+09%2C+1994&amp;author=Jean+Patteson&amp;pub=The+Sun&amp;desc=Perennial+returns+as+Lilly+Pulitzer+gets+goony+again&amp;pqatl=google|title=Perennial returns as Lilly Pulitzer gets goony again|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=June 9, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulitzer was not involved in the day-to-day administration of the company, but she continued to serve in the role of creative consultant, approving new designs, fabrics, and collections, and branching out into other product lines. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Today, the company maintains 75 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores (also known as Via Shops).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lillypulitzer.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The brand, carried by 23 company-owned retail stores, also sells to independently owned shops and major department stores, such as [[Belk]], [[Lord and Taylor]], [[Nordstrom]], [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], and [[Neiman Marcus]]. On December 21, 2010, Sugartown Worldwide, Inc. was purchased by [[Oxford Industries, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/OXM.MW/key-developments/article/2049856|title=Oxford Industries, Inc. Announces Acquisition Of Sugartown Worldwide, Inc.|publisher=Reuters|date=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, [[Target Corporation|Target]] announced a collaboration with Lilly Pulitzer. Within hours, the collection was almost entirely sold out, in stores and online.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/fashion/is-target-in-the-consumers-bulls-eye-after-the-lilly-pulitzer-dustup.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2018 [[Worth Avenue]] store located at [[Palm Beach, Florida]] with in very close proximity of the original fruit juice stand has been opened officially with a big block party and fashion show on sections of Worth Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lillypulitzer.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with women's clothing, the company also produces children's clothing, swim, shoes, jewelry, accessories, bedding (revived in 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garnethill.com/jump.jsp?itemID=11089&amp;itemType=CATEGORY&amp;path=1%2C2%2C5%2C11089 Lilly Pulitzer Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305175353/http://www.garnethill.com/jump.jsp?itemID=11089&amp;itemType=CATEGORY&amp;path=1,2,5,11089 |date=2010-03-05 }} garnethill.com&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[stationery]]. Lilly never wanted to produce clothing that was suited for the colder months. “It’s always summer somewhere,” she was quoted as saying. In accordance with Mrs. Pulitzer’s reported preferences, the dress was to be worn with bare feet and was lined, in order not to require underwear. The company launched an exclusive [[Designer Bride|Bridal Collection]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asplashofelegance.blogspot.com/2010/06/lilly-pulitzer-wedding-line.html Lilly Pulitzer Wedding Line]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwd.com/markets-news/new-bridal-lines-make-debuts-3145543?browsets=447296939593|title=New Bridal Lines Debut|date=2010-06-24|publisher=Women's Wear Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; With everything Lilly does she follows the motto "Everything is possible with sunshine and a little pink.", which very accurately represents her fun and vibrant fabric designs. Every Lilly print hides a surprise. "Lilly" is painted into each one. If you look closely at your modern or vintage prints, you'll find it!&lt;ref&gt;http://www.townandcountrymag.com/style/fashion-trends/news/a2576/things-you-didnt-know-about-lilly-pulitzer/&lt;/ref&gt; The company had a collaboration with Target in the spring of 2015 which sold out in a matter of hours. Some Lilly Pulitzer fans were offended that the brand would be offered at discounted prices, and demand was so high for the collection that it crashed the Target website, angering many customers who were unable to purchase any of the products.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/04/why-do-people-hate-lilly-pulitzer/390993/&lt;/ref&gt; The official launch date for the products was April 19, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/life/fashion/2015/01/13/this-why-the-internet-freaked-out-about-lilly-pulitzer-for-target/77K1GypB2rb0TOdpAmOBBP/story.html |title=This Is Why the Internet Freaked Out About Lilly Pulitzer for Target}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulitzer published a pair of lifestyle books&amp;mdash;''Essentially Lilly: A Guide to Colorful Entertaining'' and ''Essentially Lilly: A Guide to Colorful Holidays''&amp;mdash;with her friend, author Jay Mulvaney, showcasing her entertaining style. She also released two desk calendar books, ''Essentially Lilly 2005 Social Butterfly Engagement Calendar'' and ''Essentially Lilly 2006 Party Animal Engagement Calendar''. She was known to make special collections with [[sorority]] prints on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.lillypulitzer.com/2011/03/25/rushing-into-spring/|title=Rushing into Spring|work=Lilly Blog|date=March 25, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430210402/http://blog.lillypulitzer.com/2011/03/25/rushing-into-spring/|archivedate=April 30, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has held contests on her [[Facebook page]] to vote on which sororities will get their own prints.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/#!/video/video.php?v=10150183379859339&amp;oid=20717904360&amp;comments "Greek Chic Announcement"], May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Lilly Pulitzer stopped the production of sorority printed items.

==Personal life==
In 1950, she eloped with Herbert (Peter) Pulitzer Jr., grandson of publisher [[Joseph Pulitzer]]. The couple had three children: Peter, Minnie and Liza. In 1969, Lilly and Peter were divorced. She married Enrique Rousseau shortly thereafter. Although she legally changed her name to Lillian McKim Rousseau, her clothing company continued to operate under the "Lilly Pulitzer" label. She continued to reside in [[Palm Beach, Florida]]. Enrique Rousseau died of [[cancer]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=Gua/&gt;

==Death==
On April 7, 2013, aged 81, Pulitzer-Rousseau died at her home in [[Palm Beach, Florida]].&lt;ref name=Gua&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Lilly Pulitzer|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/apr/10/lilly-pulitzer|last=Horwell|first=Veronica|date=2013-04-10|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;Her son Peter spoke at her funeral service, saying, "Our mother was a woman of extremes…She gave and gave and gave, and asked for nothing in return…. Joyous feelings just oozed out of her…. She showed us how to enjoy life."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/world/remembering-lilly-pulitzer-she-showed-us-how-to-en/nXKGf/#__federated=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
[[Lisa Birnbach]]'s tongue-in-cheek guides, ''[[The Official Preppy Handbook]]'' and its sequel ''True Prep: It’s a Whole New Old World'', feature Lilly Pulitzer clothing as must-have items for "[[preppy]]" women. 
The [[Museum of Lifestyle &amp; Fashion History]] in [[Boynton Beach, Florida]], ran an exhibit from August 2010 through May 2011 about the clothing and designs of Lilly Pulitzer.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlfhmuseum.org/exhibitionschedule/upcomingexhibits.html|title=For the Love of LILLY|publisher=[[Museum of Lifestyle &amp; Fashion History]]|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum director Lori Durante stated ''"Lilly Pulitzer fashion is relative to the American experience ... [it] is relevant to Palm Beach County, to Florida."''&lt;ref name="sentinel"/&gt;
In 1966, [[The Washington Post]] reported that the dresses were “so popular that at the Southampton Lilly shop on Job’s Lane they are proudly put in clear plastic bags tied gaily with ribbons so that all the world may see the Lilly of your choice. It’s like carrying your own racing colors or flying a yacht flag for identification.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.backinstyle.com/blog/2015/04/10-fun-lilly-pulitzer-facts-we-bet-you-didnt-know/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009100409/http://www.backinstyle.com/blog/2015/04/10-fun-lilly-pulitzer-facts-we-bet-you-didnt-know/ |archivedate=2016-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
She changed the summer uniform of countless thousands of American women who once wore flower printed cotton shirts, wrap around skirts and big, klonky, thick-soled loafers.The total look was usually that of a shirt tail flapping out awkwardly in the back. “Lilly Pulitzer,” the article continued, “neatly put a stop to all that.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2901">'''Logistics Support System''' (LSS) is a tool created by the [[Pan American Health Organization]] and six [[United Nations]] agencies for the purpose of facilitating the communication among [[humanitarian]] agencies, non-governmental organizations, donors, media or countries and enhancing the coordination of  humanitarian supply chain. By creating matching tables to collect information from other [[tracking systems]] or by having access to already existing data in the systems' database, logistics support systems have the ability to provide decision supporting reports that show which relief supplies were received or delivered, where they have been stored, which relief supplies are requested and how useful they are at a specific moment. Sorting and classifying incoming supplies are also some functions of a logistics support system. Consequently, the function of the logistics support system enhances the proactivity of a humanitarian organization by improving problem traceability and performance monitoring and providing the advantage to timely change the plan of the supply chain without consequences.

Two modules of the logistics support system have been created: a module that operates under Windows systems and a second module that operates under a web browser. The Logistics Support System has been used in many [[natural disasters]], including Pakistan earthquake in October 2005 and Bolivian floods in February 2006. This is being used in response to the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmsinc.com/Consulting/portfolio/logistics-support-system.aspx Logistics Support System (LSS) for the International Humanitarian Relief Logistics for the Pan American Health Organization and Six UN Agencies]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ma Ying-piu''' ({{zh-t|馬應彪}}; 21 December 1860 – 15 July 1944) was a Hong Kong retailer and businessman. He founded the [[Sincere Department Store]] in 1900, the first Chinese-owned department store in China and was the "father of Chinese department stores".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The China Monthly Review - Volume 38|page=41|year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early ventures and business career==
Ma was born in Heungshan (today's [[Zhongshan]]) of the [[Kwangtung Province]] on 21 December 1860. Following his father's footstep who emigrated to Australia two decades before, Ma went to [[New South Wales]] at the age of 19 to work in a gold mine. He was also involved in the cultivation of bananas and the fruit trade which was dominated by Chinese at the time. In 1892, Ma founded the fruit trading firm Wing Sang Company with other Christian Chinese form his village.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Hong Kong Biography|first1=May|last1=Holdsworth|first2=Christopher|last2=Munn|year=2012|pages=294−5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old Sincere Hong Kong.jpg|thumb|A [[Sincere Department Store]] in [[Central, Hong Kong]], circa 1941.]]
Ma returned to Hong Kong in 1894 and set up a store. Impressed by the Western model of department stores, Ma opened the [[Sincere Department Store]] with other wealthy investors on 8 January 1900 at 172 [[Queen's Road Central]], which became the first Chinese-owned department store in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; In the store Ma introduced Western retailing ideas and engagement of both men and women as sales assistants for the first time which was seen as a revolutionary idea in the conservative colony. He also insisted on the policy of fixed price, practice of providing receipt for each sale and closing the stores on Sundays, being a Christian himself.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; 

The Sincere opened its Canton branch in 1912 and Shanghai branch in 1917. A six-storey Hong Kong store was also opened and was listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] in 1917.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; It had branches in the large cities such as Shanghai, Canton, Singapore, and Namning, with a paid-up capital of $7,000,000 at peak.&lt;ref name="aus"/&gt;{ Ma's business also diversified into banking, insurance, hotels and cosmetics, in the form of the National Commercial and Savings Bank, Ltd. in 1921, with an authorized capital of $5,000,000, as well as the Sincere Insurance and Investment Co. Ltd. and the Sincere Perfumery Factory.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; His business suffered from the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in the 1930s which resulted in the collapse of his National Commercial Bank in 1935.

==Philanthropy works==
Ma has contributed large sums to schools and hospitals, especially in his native town of Heungshan including the establishment Sai Kwong Girls’ School in [[Shiqi Subdistrict|Shekki]], the capital of Heungshan.&lt;ref name="aus"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thechinastory.org/ritp/ma-ying-piu-ma-yingbiao-%E9%A6%AC%E6%87%89%E5%BD%AA/|title=Ma Ying-piu (Ma Yingbiao) 馬應彪|work=Biographies of Prominent Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became the first Chinese director of [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)|Lingnan College]] in Canton, to which he made major donations.&lt;ref name="rag"/&gt; The Ma Ying-piu Infirmary and the Ma Ying-piu Guesthouse of the [[Sun Yat-sen University]] which used to be the site of Lingnan College are named after him.

==Political involvement==
Ma first met revolutionary [[Sun Yat-sen]], also a Heungshan native, in 1892 during a visit home and was impressed by his vision of the resurrection of China that he agreed to provide him financial support.&lt;ref name="rag"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/476852/chapter-ends-sincerely-chinese-rags-riches-story|title=Chapter ends for a sincerely Chinese rags-to-riches story|date=5 November 2004|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the anti-Japanese boycott of 1908 in which he spurned Japanese products and replaced by locally made products. He also helped set up the East Canton Red Cross Society to relieve men wounded in the [[Wuchang Uprising]].

==Family==
He married [[Fok Hing-tong]] (1872–1957), second daughter of Fok Ching-shang, the Vicar of St. Stephen's Anglican Church. Fok Hing-tong accompanied Ma to Australia and helped out his business. She also doubled as a saleswoman on occasion. She co-founded the [[Chinese YWCA of Hong Kong|Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA) in Hong Kong and became its chairwoman (1920–23) and director (1920–28, 1948–57). Under her leadership, the YWCA strongly supported the [[Anti-Mui Tsai Activism|anti-''mui tsai'' movement]] in the 1920s. The couple had 13 children, of which the fourth son, [[Ma Man-fai]], was a social activist.

'''Sir Martin Stuart Sorrell''' (born 14 February 1945) is a British businessman and the founder of [[WPP plc]], the world's largest advertising and PR group, both by revenue and the number of staff. Upon his retirement in April 2018, Sorrell was the longest-serving chief executive of a FTSE 100 company.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/martin-sorrell-resigns-wpp-investigation-personal-misconduct-allegations-ftse-100-a8305366.html|title=Who is Martin Sorrell, the UK’s longest serving chief executive of a FTSE 100 company?|date=2018-04-15|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for being consistently one of the UK's highest-paid corporate executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WPP to cut Sir Martin Sorrell's pay in bid to calm investors |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/wpp-to-cut-martin-sorrells-pay-in-bid-to-calm-investors |accessdate=11 June 2018 |publisher=The Guardian |date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sorrell has served on boards and advisory bodies of a number of high-profile public, academic and business organisations, including several leading business schools, both in the UK and internationally.

==Career==

===Early career===
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent [[Mark McCormack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/business/analysis_and_features/article8032.ece |title=The Interview: Celebrating 60 and two decades of worldwide growth – Business Analysis &amp; Features |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=26 March 2005 |accessdate=19 April 2011 |first=Damian |last=Reece |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121180453/http://news.independent.co.uk/business/analysis_and_features/article8032.ece |archivedate=21 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as ''"the third brother"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/century/people016.html |title=Ad Age Advertising Century: People: Martin Sorrell |work=Advertising Age |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the [[earn out|‘earn-out’]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===WPP===
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in [[Wire and Plastic Products plc|Wire and Plastic Products]], a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566&amp;nbsp;million [[hostile takeover]] of [[J. Walter Thompson]].  Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825&amp;nbsp;million buy of [[Ogilvy and Mather]]. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, [[Young &amp; Rubicam]] and [[Grey Global Group|Grey]].&lt;ref name=MS-B-06/&gt;

In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farrell|first1=Sean|title=WPP's Martin Sorrell gets £36m payout for 2014 under contentious share plan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/16/wpps-martin-sorrell-gets-36m-payout-for-2014-under-contentious-share-plan|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Sorrel said that "digital disruption" was forcing companies to change their business models and reach customers in different ways when shares in WPP fell by more than 10% at the start of trading after the advertising giant reported slowing sales and warned about future growth.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title= WPP cuts growth forecast as second quarter sales slow - BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41021603|work=BBC |accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Sorrell criticised the marketing industry, arguing it is "too competitive" and that agencies value winning contracts, whether they are profitable or not, over content since making the headlines in a trade magazine is more important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/wpps-sorrell-agencies-obsessed-winning-business-just-trade-press-headlines-474300|title=WPP's Sorrell: Agencies are obsessed with winning business just for the trade press headlines - Mumbrella|date=26 September 2017|work=Mumbrella|access-date=24 October 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Sorrell became the longest-serving CEO of any company featured in the U.K.'s benchmark FTSE 100 Index - having stewarded WPP since 1985.

In April 2018, Sorrell retired from WPP after 33 years, following allegations of personal misconduct and misuse of company assets. Sorrell has denied the allegations. [[Roberto Quarta]], chairman of WPP, become Executive Chairman until the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-april-2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=WPP CEO Sorrell Quits After Three Decades at Top of Ad World|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-14/wpp-ceo-sorrell-quits-after-three-decades-at-top-of-ad-world|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|language=en|date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorrell was a "[[Remainer]]" in the run up to the [[Brexit referendum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/17/cnbc-transcript-interview-with-sir-martin-sorrell.html|title=CNBC Transcript: Interview with Sir Martin Sorrell|last=CNBC|date=17 January 2017|work=CNBC|access-date=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has expressed support for a second referendum on EU membership once the Brexit terms have been finalized, stating that when "we finally see what the terms are of Brexit, then the electorate can be asked to reconfirm in whichever way possible, referendum or general election platform, that they still want to go ahead.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cityam.com/248195/wpp-chief-and-remain-campaigner-martin-sorrell-wants-second|title=WPP chief and Remain campaigner Martin Sorrell wants second EU vote|last=Turvill|first=William|date=24 August 2016|access-date=24 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also justified new investments in France, Germany, Italy and Spain as a means to protect WPP against immigration caps following Brexit, emphasising the importance of freedom of movement of WPP's work force, 17 percent are from EU countries other than the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.fr/uk/sir-martin-sorrell-wpp-investing-europe-brexit-safeguard-2017-8/|title=Sir Martin Sorrell: WPP is investing in Europe to protect against Brexit immigration curbs|website=Business Insider France|language=fr-FR|access-date=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provided him instead with no termination payment.

In 2005 his pay was £2.42&amp;nbsp;million including cash and bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Paul Murphy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/executivepay/story/0,,1499108,00.html |title=Martin Sorrell piles up £50m of WPP shares in nine months &amp;#124; Business |work=The Guardian  |location=UK |date= 4 June 2005|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further he exercised £52&amp;nbsp;million in share options, was entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65&amp;nbsp;million shares valued at £15&amp;nbsp;million until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article336156.ece |title=Sir Martin Sorrell: Full of Eastern promise |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2 January 2006 |accessdate=19 April 2011 |first=Raymond |last=Snoddy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906190743/http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article336156.ece |archivedate=6 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5&amp;nbsp;million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.&lt;ref name="Guardian2011"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/apr/28/martin-sorrell-wpp | title=Sir Martin Sorrell's pay rises to £4.5m |work=The Guardian  | date=28 April 2011 | accessdate=28 October 2011 | author=Sweney, Mark | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages&lt;ref name="BBC2011"&gt;{{cite video | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9626000/9626078.stm | title=Sir Martin Sorrell defends top pay | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | date=28 October 2011 | people=Martin Sorrell}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when [[real wages|real average wages]] in the Western world were declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ercouncil.org/chart_of_the_week.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1319202041&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=3&amp; | title=Week 42, 2011: UK Real Average Wage | publisher=Economic Research Council | date=21 October 2011 | accessdate=28 October 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425121646/http://www.ercouncil.org/chart_of_the_week.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1319202041&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=3&amp; | archivedate=25 April 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BW2008"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2008/11/real_wages_cont.html | title=Real Wages Continue to Fall |work=Business Week | date=3 November 2008 | accessdate=28 October 2011 | author=Mandel, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.

In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's [[Young &amp; Rubicam|Y&amp;R]] subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in [[Zimbabwe]]. A report by the ''[[Financial Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6f1ae61e-3e63-11dd-b16d-0000779fd2ac.html |title=/ UK – Campaign link forces WPP sale |work=Financial Times  |date=20 June 2008 |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; found out that Imago was employed by [[Robert Mugabe]]'s campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&amp;R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.prweek.com/article/1252128/wpp-sell-mugabe-associated-zimbabwe-agency|title=WPP to sell Mugabe-associated Zimbabwe agency|access-date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following criticism about his pay from investors, Sorrell agreed to a pay cut that would have reduced his salary from £46 million in 2016 to £13 million by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/29/martin-sorrell-sunset-superstar-chief-executives-wpp-executive-pay|title=Martin Sorrell and the sunset of the superstar chief executives|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=29 April 2017|work=The Observer|access-date=24 October 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[2000 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/14/mediatop100200811 |title=13. Sir Martin Sorrell &amp;#124; Media |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the [[Harvard Business School]]’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by [[Dean (education)|Dean]] [[Jay O. Light]]. The award was also given to: [[Ayala Corp.]] chair [[Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala]],  A. Malachi Mixon of [[Invacare]], [[Donna Dubinsky]] and [[Hansjörg Wyss]] of [[Synthes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/Story_Page/tabid/55/cat/exclusives/news/3815/Default.aspx Abs-Cbn Interactive, JAZA receives Harvard alumni award]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 he was a Trustee of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/management/trustees.aspx The British Museum Trustees], British Museum, accessed 31 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref name="Mail 2009-01-24"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1127055/City-tycoon-Martin-Sorrell--8216-used-45million-shares-pay-divorce.html |title=City tycoon Martin Sorrell 'used £45 million in shares to pay for divorce' |work=[[Daily Mail]] |first=Simon |last=Duke |date=24 January 2009 |accessdate=21 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/features/1161352/sir-martin-sorrell-losing-something-gets-me/ |title=Sir Martin Sorrell: 'Losing something still gets to me' |work=[[Management Today]] |first=Matthew |last=Gwyther |date=3 December 2012 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorrell was previously married to the American-born&lt;ref name="Mail 2009-01-24"/&gt; Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sorrell's "obsession with work".&lt;ref name="Mail 2009-01-24"/&gt; In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,&lt;ref name="BrandRepublic 2005-12-21"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/br/article/533574/divorce-forces-sorrell-cash-12m-wpp-shares/ |title=Divorce forces Sorrell to cash in £12m of WPP shares |work=[[Brand Republic]] |date=21 December 2005 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709021516/http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/br/article/533574/divorce-forces-sorrell-cash-12m-wpp-shares/ |archivedate=9 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Ms. Finestone, represented by [[Nicholas Mostyn]] QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey [[Georgian architecture|Georgian townhouse]]; two [[Harrods]] underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.&lt;ref name="Mail 2009-01-24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BrandRepublic 2005-12-21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FT 2005-10-25"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e9519472-44f2-11da-a5f0-00000e2511c8.html |title=Sorrell breaks trend in divorce settlement |work=[[Financial Times]] |first=Bob |last=Sherwood |date=25 October 2005 |accessdate=21 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.&lt;ref name="BrandRepublic 2005-12-21"/&gt;

The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,&lt;ref name="Mail 2009-01-24"/&gt; and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sorrell — a break from the previously established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Appeal Court]] Justice [[Mathew Thorpe]] in the 2002 divorce between [[Harry Lambert (businessman)|Harry]] and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.&lt;ref name="FT 2005-10-25"/&gt; In the ''Lambert'' judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sorrell was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with [[Hugh Bennett (judge)|Mr Justice Bennett]] citing Sorrell's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.&lt;ref name="FT 2005-10-25"/&gt;

Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to [[Cambridge University]] and then [[Goldman Sachs]], although two have since left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/features/1161352/sir-martin-sorrell-losing-something-gets-me/ |title=WPP's Sir Martin Sorrell is Britain's Most Admired Leader 2012 |website=Managementtoday.co.uk |date=3 December 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Sorrell]] is president of the hedge fund [[Man Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.man.com/teams/jonathan-sorrell|title=Jonathan Sorrell - Man Group|website=www.man.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mexican Stock Exchange''' ({{lang-es|Bolsa Mexicana de Valores}}), commonly known as '''Mexican Bolsa''', '''Mexbol''', or '''BMV''', is one of two [[stock exchange]]s in [[Mexico]], the other being [[BIVA - Bolsa Institucional de Valores]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/articulos/nueva-bolsa-institucional-de-valores?idiom=es|title=Nueva Bolsa Institucional de Valores|first=Presidencia de la|last=República|website=gob.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is the second largest stock exchange in [[Latin America]], only after [[São Paulo]] based [[BM&amp;F Bovespa|B3]] in [[Brasil]]. It is also the fifth largest stock exchange in [[the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-exchanges.org/statistics/monthly-reports |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817220823/http://www.world-exchanges.org/statistics/monthly-reports |archivedate=2014-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exchange platform is owned by [[BMV Group]], which also owns the derivative exchange ''MexDer'' and the custody agency ''Indeval''.

The BMV was created out of the merger of the three stock exchanges which formerly operated in Mexico: The ''Bolsa de Valores de México'', which operated in [[Mexico City]], the Bolsa de Occidente (''Occidental Stock Exchange'') in [[Guadalajara]], and the Bolsa de Monterrey (''Monterrey Stock Exchange''). The exchange kept modernising until its introduction of a fully electronic system for trading which was consolidated in 1999.

In 2014, the Mexican Stock Exchange completed its first trade as a part of [[Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano|MILA]] which, together with the stock exchanges of [[Santiago Stock Exchange|Santiago]], [[Lima Stock Exchange|Lima]], and [[Colombia Stock Exchange|Colombia]], is the second largest securities market by total capitalisation in Latin America.

== History ==
=== Bolsa de México===
From 1880 to 1900, Plateros and Cadena streets in the [[Historic Center of Mexico City|historic centre of Mexico City]] were home to recurring meetings in which brokers and businessmen purchased and sold all kinds of commodities as well as stocks in [[public offering]]s. Afterwards, exclusive groups of shareholders and issuing company representatives would gather to negotiate behind closed doors in different places around the city.

[[File:Calle Madero - Mexico City.jpg|thumbnail|left|Madero Avenue, home of the first stock exchange in Mexico, is today a pedestrian mall.]]
In 1894, Manuel Algara, Camilo Arriaga, and Manuel Nicolín pushed, among the most distinguished brokers of the time, the idea of a normative and institutionalised system to trade securities. With the increased backing and widespread support for his ideas, the '''Bolsa Nacional''' (''National Stock Exchange'') was founded on 31 October 1894 at 9 Plateros Street, later renamed [[Francisco I. Madero Avenue|Madero Street]]. Less than a year later, another group of brokers, led by Francisco A. Llerena and Luis G. Necochea, formed a society named '''Bolsa de México''' (''Stock Exchange of Mexico)'', and registered as a competing establishment on 14 June 1895. Because of coinciding objectives and links between members of the two institutions, leaders began discussing a union between them. On 3 September 1895, the merger was finalised, keeping the name Bolsa de México, and the administrative offices at the Plateros Street address. The company was officially inaugurated on 21 October 1895.

By the start of the following year, Bolsa de México had three public issuing companies and eight private ones, among them, the [[Bank of Mexico]], the [[Grupo Financiero Banamex|National Bank of Mexico]], and the {{Interlanguage link multi|Banco de Londres y México|es}} (later acquired by [[Banco Santander]]).
On 1 March 1933, the [[Congress of Mexico]] passed and President [[Abelardo L. Rodríguez]] signed into law the Regulatory Decree of the General Law of Credit Institutions and Auxiliary Organisations, normalising the exchange of securities and the stock market in Mexico.

===Bolsa de Valores de México, S.A.===
[[File:Abelardo.rodriguez.jpg|framed|right|President Abelardo L. Rodríguez]]
Because of the legal reforms of the time, and the concession authorised by Congress on 28 October 1933, which for the first time included stock exchanges, the charter and bylaws of the Bolsa de Valores de México, S.A. (Stock Exchange of Mexico) were approved, and on 5 September, the institution was incorporated. That same year, the National Securities Commission, later renamed [[Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores|National Banking and Securities Commission]], was established to supervise the Bolsa de Valores de México.

Because of substantial industrial and commercial growth in Mexico mid-century, owing to the rise in the creation of [[maquiladora]]s in northern Mexico, as well as the accumulation of capital and the constant creation of new businesses at the time, the [[Monterrey]] Stock Exchange was established, and it grew to serve the entire North of the country, reaching over 100 listings.&lt;ref&gt;title="Desigualdad, poder y cambio social en Monterrey" by Menno Vellinga. 1988. Siglo Veintiuno Editores&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, businesses in [[Guadalajara]] started organising a third stock exchange, and in 1960, the Occidental Stock Exchange was established to serve the West coast of Mexico.

===Mexican Stock Exchange created===
[[File:Bolsa de Valores México.JPG|thumbnail|left|The Stock Exchange Centre in 2012]]
Because of low performance in the Guadalajara and Monterrey stock exchanges, however, Congress passed in 1975 the Securities' Market Law, which prompted the Bolsa de Valores de México to change its name to Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (Mexican Stock Exchange) and merge the other two exchange houses into it, creating thus the single entity that remains to this day the only stock exchange in Mexico.

On 19 April 1990, the Centro Bursátil was finished on [[Paseo de la Reforma]], turning the Stock Exchange Centre into the heart of the financial district of Mexico City. Five years later, the BMV completely modernised the centre, introducing a completely electronic system (BMV-SENTRA) which was phased into the workings of the exchange, becoming fully operational by 1999.

In 2001, [[Citigroup]] became the first foreign company to begin trading in the BMV, opening the door to many new companies to do the same, especially from Central and South America. The same year, the Securities'  Market Law was reformed according to the demutualisation of BMV. The following year, the Corporativo Mexicano del Mercado de Valores, S.A. de C.V. was constituted to manage the hiring of personnel, and administration of the Stock Exchange and other financial institutions within the Centre.

In 2003, the global market was made available through the BMV, allowing national investors access to foreign securities from within the country. In 2006, the Mexican securities market was opened to foreigners through the MexDer system, allowing them operation from anywhere in the world. In October of the same year, four ETFs ([[exchange-traded fund]]s) over indexes of the stock exchange itself were listed, placing BMV in the first place in [[Latin America]] in terms of ETFs listed over own indexes, and as the leading stock exchange in terms of total ETFs.

In 2010, the BMV signed an alliance with the world's largest derivatives exchange, the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], putting Mexican derivatives within reach of international investors.


The Mexican Stock Exchange, BMV, announced its first trade made as part of the [[Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano|Latin American Integrated Market]] (MILA by its Spanish initials) on 2 December 2014.&lt;ref name="FTMILA"&gt;{{cite web|author= Jude Webber|title= Mexico exchange names Sacristán as new head| url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4ef088e4-7a43-11e4-a8e1-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3OKK1KxiZ |publisher=Financial Times |accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade on MIILA was a $1,415 purchase of 200 shares in Chilean retailer [[Falabella (retail store)|Falabella]], executed by GBM Mexico through GBM Chile.&lt;ref name="FTMILA"/&gt; With the entry of Mexico into MILA, the integrated stock market now counts 798 issuers among the four countries, making it the biggest market by number of listed companies in Latin America, and the biggest in terms of market capitalization, according to the [[World Federation of Exchanges]].&lt;ref name="FTMILA"/&gt; The joint capitalization of the four bourses tops US$1.25 trillion, making it larger than the US$1.22 trillion [[BM&amp;F Bovespa]].&lt;ref name="Nasdaq"&gt;{{cite web|author= Peter Kohli|title= The Andean Exchange: A Developing Market Opportunity In Our Backyard| url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/the-andean-exchange-a-developing-market-opportunity-in-our-backyard-cm331968#ixzz3OKW48vfz |publisher=Nasdaq |accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move comes largely as step in the integration efforts between Mexico, [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], and [[Peru]], as members of the [[Pacific Alliance]].

== Structure and operations ==
BMV is now a public company following its IPO in June 2008, and its shares are traded on the BMV equities market. It operates by concession of the [[Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stockexchange.com.mx/ |title=Data |website=stockexchange.com.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until its IPO BMV was owned by its members, which were a group of banks and brokerage firms. The exchange trades [[debt]] instruments including Federal Treasury certificates ([[CETES]]), Federal Government Development [[Government bond|bonds]] (BONDES), Investment Unit bonds (UDIBONOS), [[Bankers acceptance]]s, [[promissory notes]] with [[Yield (finance)|yield]] payable at [[maturity (finance)|maturity]], [[commercial paper]] and [[International financial institutions|development bank]] bonds. In addition, it also trades [[stocks]], [[debentures]], [[mutual fund]] [[Share (finance)|shares]], and [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]]. Trading is conducted electronically through the BMV-SENTRA [[Equity (economics)|Equities]] System. Settlement is T+3, and trading hours are 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 3 p.m. for the capital markets and 8 a.m. to 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. for debt instruments (Monday through Friday),

== Indices ==
The BMV calculates 13 indices of stock prices. Each [[index (economics)|index]] can be used as an underlying value for [[derivative]] products listed on specialized markets. The main benchmark stock index is called the '''IPC''', which stands for [[Índice de Precios y Cotizaciones]], and is the broadest indicator of the BMV's overall performance. It is made up of a balanced weighted selection of shares that are representative of all the shares listed on the exchange from various sectors across the economy, and is revised twice a year. Weight is determined by [[market capitalization]]. The IPC's value is related to the previous day's value, rather than the base date of October 30, 1978. Since February 2009 the IPC index has included BMV's own A shares. Indice Mexico (INMEX) is a market capitalization weighted index of 20 to 25 of the BMV's most highly marketable issuers, using their most representative series. The sample is limited to issuers with a minimum market value of $100 million and is revised every six months. The weighting cannot be greater than 10% at the start of each calculation period.

{{Labor|expanded=rights|sp=us}}A '''minimum wage''' is the lowest [[remuneration]] that employers can legally pay their workers. Equivalently, it is the [[price floor]] below which workers may not sell their labor. Although [[minimum wage law]]s are in effect in many jurisdictions, differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage. Supporters of the minimum wage say it increases the [[standard of living]] of workers, [[poverty reduction|reduces poverty]], reduces inequality, and boosts morale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Should We Raise The Minimum Wage?  |url=https://www.theperspective.com/debates/living/raise-minimum-wage/ |publisher=The Perspective |date=30 August 2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty, increases unemployment (particularly among unskilled or inexperienced workers) and is damaging to businesses, because excessively high minimum wages require businesses to raise the prices of their product or service to accommodate the extra expense of paying a higher wage.&lt;ref name="Burkhauser"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2210&amp;context=ilrreview |title=Minimum Wages. by David Neumark and William L.

[[Supply and demand|Supply and demand models]] point to welfare and employment losses from minimum wages. However, if the labor market is not perfectly competitive, minimum wages can increase the efficiency of the market.  For example, in a [[monopsony]] labor market (i.e. only one employer available), a minimum wage set modestly above equilibrium wages can increase wages, employment, and economic efficiency. Considerable debate still exists among economists about the real-world effect of minimum wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas C. |last=Leonard |chapter=The Very Idea of Apply Economics: The Modern Minimum-Wage Controversy and Its Antecedents |title=Toward a History of Applied Economics |editor-first=Roger E. |editor-last=Backhouse |editor2-first=Jeff |editor2-last=Biddle |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0-8223-6485-9 |pages=117–144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern national laws enforcing compulsory union membership which prescribed minimum wages for their members were first passed in New Zealand and Australia in the 1890s. The movement for minimum wages was first motivated as a way to stop the exploitation of workers in [[sweatshop]]s, by employers who were thought to have unfair bargaining power over them. Over time, minimum wages came to be seen as a way to help lower-income families. Most [[List of minimum wages by country|countries had introduced minimum wage legislation]] by the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ILO 2006"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/condtrav/pdf/infosheets/w-1.pdf | title=ILO 2006: Minimum wages policy (PDF) | publisher=Ilo.org | accessdate=1 March 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229085643/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/condtrav/pdf/infosheets/w-1.pdf | archivedate=29 December 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern minimum wage laws trace their origin to the [[Ordinance of Labourers 1349|Ordinance of Labourers]] (1349), which was a decree by [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] that set a'' [[maximum wage]]'' for laborers in [[medieval England]].&lt;ref name=Mihm&gt;{{cite news|last=Mihm|first=Stephen|title=How the Black Death Spawned the Minimum Wage|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-09-05/how-the-black-death-spawned-the-minimum-wage|accessdate=17 April 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg View|date=5 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234149/http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-09-05/how-the-black-death-spawned-the-minimum-wage|archivedate=18 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/6760/405260Minimum0101OFFICIAL0USE0ONLY1.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419012530/https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/6760/405260Minimum0101OFFICIAL0USE0ONLY1.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=19 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  King Edward III, who was a wealthy landowner, was dependent, like his lords, on [[serfs]] to work the land. In the autumn of 1348, the [[Black Plague]] reached England and decimated the population.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/29/black-death-not-spread-rat-fleas-london-plague |title= Black death was not spread by rat fleas, say researchers |last1= Thorpe |first1= Vanessa |date= 29 March 2014 |journal= The Guardian |accessdate= 29 March 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140330010701/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/29/black-death-not-spread-rat-fleas-london-plague |archivedate= 30 March 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The severe shortage of labor caused wages to soar and encouraged King Edward III to set a wage ceiling. Subsequent amendments to the ordinance, such as the [[Statute of Labourers 1351|Statute of Labourers]] (1351), increased the penalties for paying a wage above the set rates.&lt;ref name="Mihm"/&gt;

While the laws governing wages initially set a ceiling on compensation, they were eventually used to set a [[living wage]]. An amendment to the Statute of Labourers in 1389 effectively fixed wages to the price of food. As time passed, the [[Justice of the Peace]], who was charged with setting the maximum wage, also began to set formal minimum wages. The practice was eventually formalized with the passage of the Act Fixing a Minimum Wage in 1604 by [[King James I]] for workers in the textile industry.&lt;ref name=Mihm/&gt;

By the early 19th century, the Statutes of Labourers was repealed as increasingly [[History of capitalism|capitalistic England]] embraced ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policies which disfavored regulations of wages (whether upper or lower limits).&lt;ref name="Mihm" /&gt; The subsequent 19th century saw significant [[Timeline of labor issues and events|labor unrest]] affect many industrial nations. As [[trade unions]] were decriminalized during the century, attempts to control wages through [[collective agreement]] were made. However, this meant that a uniform minimum wage was not possible. In ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in 1848, [[John Stuart Mill]] argued that because of the [[collective action problems]] that workers faced in organisation, it was a justified departure from ''laissez-faire'' policies (or [[freedom of contract]]) to regulate people's wages and hours by the law.

It was not until the 1890s that the first modern legislative attempts to regulate minimum wages were seen in New Zealand and Australia.&lt;ref name="Starr" /&gt; The movement for a minimum wage was initially focused on stopping [[sweatshop]] labor and controlling the proliferation of sweatshops in manufacturing industries.&lt;ref name=Nordlund&gt;{{cite book|last=Nordlund|first=Willis J.|title=The quest for a living wage : the history of the federal minimum wage program|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=9780313264122|page=xv|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iNnsATsBQa4C&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=history+of+minimum+wage+laws#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20minimum%20wage%20laws&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sweatshops employed large numbers of women and young workers, paying them what were considered to be substandard wages. The sweatshop owners were thought to have unfair bargaining power over their employees, and a minimum wage was proposed as a means to make them pay fairly. Over time, the focus changed to helping people, especially families, become more self-sufficient.&lt;ref name="Neumark"&gt;{{cite book | last = Neumark | first = David | authorlink =  | author2 = William L.

The first modern national minimum wages were enacted by the government recognition of unions which in turn established minimum wage policy among their members, as in [[Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894|New Zealand in 1894]], followed by [[Australian labour movement|Australia in 1896]] and the [[Trade Boards Act 1909|United Kingdom in 1909]].&lt;ref name=Starr&gt;{{cite book|last=Starr|first=Gerald|title=Minimum wage fixing : an international review of practices and problems|year=1993|publisher=International Labour Office|location=Geneva|isbn=9789221025115|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gzurqlZpyfcC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=the+history+of+%22minimum+wage%22+law#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20history%20of%20%22minimum%20wage%22%20law&amp;f=false|edition=2nd impression (with corrections)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, statutory minimum wages were first introduced [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938|nationally in 1938]],&lt;ref name=DOL&gt;{{cite web|last=Grossman|first=Jonathan|title=Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938: Maximum Struggle for a Minimum Wage|url=http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/flsa1938.htm|publisher=Department of Labor|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416113027/http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/flsa1938.htm|archivedate=16 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were reintroduced and expanded in the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998|United Kingdom in 1998]].&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Jon|title=History of the UK's minimum wage|url=http://www.totalpolitics.com/blog/28013/history-of-the-uk-s-minimum-wage.thtml|accessdate=17 April 2014|newspaper=Total Politics|date=1 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114075901/http://www.totalpolitics.com/blog/28013/history-of-the-uk-s-minimum-wage.thtml|archivedate=14 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is now legislation or binding [[collective bargaining]] regarding minimum wage in more than 90 percent of all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Walter E. |date=June 2009 |title=The Best Anti-Poverty Program We Have? |journal=Regulation |volume=32 |issue=2 |page=62 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+best+anti-poverty+program+we+have%3F-a0203335454}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ILO 2006"/&gt; In the European Union, 22 member states out of 28 currently have national minimum wages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Minimum wage statistics – Statistics Explained|url = http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Minimum_wage_statistics|website = ec.europa.eu|access-date = 12 February 2016|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160207085307/http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Minimum_wage_statistics|archivedate = 7 February 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, such as Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy, have no minimum wage laws, but rely on employer groups and trade unions to set minimum earnings through collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, Ronald G.

Minimum wage rates vary greatly across many different jurisdictions, not only in setting a particular amount of money—for example $7.25 per hour ($14,500 per year) under certain US state laws (or $2.13 for employees who receive tips, which is known as the [[Tipped wage in the United States|tipped minimum wage]]), $11.00 in the US state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Minimum Wage | url=http://www.lni.wa.gov/workplacerights/wages/minimum | publisher=Washington State Dept. of Labor &amp; Industries | accessdate=18 January 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112020816/http://www.lni.wa.gov/workplacerights/wages/minimum/ | archivedate=12 January 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[British pound|£]]7.83 (for those aged 25+) in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.minimum-wage.co.uk/ | title=National Minimum Wage 2018 | accessdate=24 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—but also in terms of which pay period (for example Russia and China set monthly minimum wages) or the scope of coverage. Currently the American federal minimum wage rests at seven dollars, twenty-five cents ($7.25) per hour.

===Informal minimum wages===
Customs and extra-legal pressures from governments or labor unions can produce a ''de facto'' minimum wage. So can international public opinion, by pressuring [[multinational companies]] to pay [[Third World]] workers wages usually found in more industrialized countries. The latter situation in Southeast Asia and Latin America was publicized in the 2000s, but it existed with companies in West Africa in the middle of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="SowellBasic"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sowell |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Sowell |year=2004 |chapter=Minimum Wage Laws |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ax6dsqMdPHQC&amp;pg=PA163 |pages=163–69 |title=Basic Economics: A Citizen's Guide to the Economy |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-465-08145-5 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Setting minimum wage===
Among the indicators that might be used to establish an initial minimum wage rate are ones that minimize the loss of jobs while preserving international competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;''Provisional Minimum Wage Commission: Preliminary Views on a Bask of Indicators, Other Relevant Considerations and Impact Assessment,'' Provisional Minimum Wage Commission, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, {{cite web |url=http://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/rbo/Assessment.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119120419/http://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/rbo/Assessment.pdf |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are general economic conditions as measured by real and nominal gross domestic product; inflation; labor supply and demand; wage levels, distribution and differentials; employment terms; productivity growth; labor costs; business operating costs; the number and trend of bankruptcies; [[Index of Economic Freedom|economic freedom]] rankings; standards of living and the prevailing average wage rate.

In the business sector, concerns include the expected increased cost of doing business, threats to profitability, rising levels of unemployment (and subsequent higher government expenditure on welfare benefits raising tax rates), and the possible [[knock-on effect]]s to the wages of more experienced workers who might already be earning the new statutory minimum wage, or slightly more.&lt;ref&gt;''Setting the Initial Statutory Minimum Wage Rate,'' submission to government by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/ref&gt; Among workers and their representatives, political considerations weigh in as labor leaders seek to win support by demanding the highest possible rate.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Joseph, "Minimum wage legislation for all sectors," China Daily 16 October 2008 {{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2008-10/16/content_7110239.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503235232/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2008-10/16/content_7110239.htm |archivedate=3 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other concerns include [[purchasing power]], inflation indexing and standardized working hours.

===Supply and demand model===
[[File:Wage labour 2.svg|thumb|Graph showing the basic [[supply and demand]] model of the minimum wage in the labor market.]]
{{Main|Supply and demand}}

According to the supply and demand model of the labor market shown in many economics textbooks, increasing the minimum wage decreases the employment of minimum-wage workers.&lt;ref name="Card&amp;Krueger" /&gt; One such textbook states:&lt;ref name="Gwartney"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gwartney |first1=James David |first2=J. R. |last2=Clark  |first3=Richard L. |last3=Stroup  |year=1985 |title=Essentials of Economics|page=405 |publisher=Harcourt College Pub; 2 edition |location=New York |isbn=978-0123110350}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
If a higher minimum wage increases the wage rates of unskilled workers above the level that would be established by market forces, the quantity of unskilled workers employed will fall. The minimum wage will price the services of the least productive (and therefore lowest-wage) workers out of the market. … the direct results of minimum wage legislation are clearly mixed. Some workers, most likely those whose previous wages were closest to the minimum, will enjoy higher wages. Others, particularly those with the lowest prelegislation wage rates, will be unable to find work. They will be pushed into the ranks of the unemployed.}}

A firm's cost is an increasing function of the wage rate. The higher the wage rate, the fewer hours an employer will demand of employees. This is because, as the wage rate rises, it becomes more expensive for firms to hire workers and so firms hire fewer workers (or hire them for fewer hours). The [[Labour demand|demand of labor]] curve is therefore shown as a line moving down and to the right.&lt;ref name="Ehren"&gt;Ehrenberg, R. and Smith, R. "Modern labor economics: theory and public policy", HarperCollins, 1994, 5th ed.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since higher wages increase the quantity supplied, the [[Labour supply|supply of labor]] curve is upward sloping, and is shown as a line moving up and to the right.&lt;ref name="Ehren"/&gt;  If no minimum wage is in place, wages will adjust until quantity of labor demanded is equal to quantity supplied, reaching [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], where the supply and demand curves intersect. Minimum wage behaves as a classical [[price floor]] on labor. Standard theory says that, if set above the equilibrium price, more labor will be willing to be provided by workers than will be demanded by employers, creating a [[Economic surplus|surplus]] of labor, i.e. unemployment.&lt;ref name="Ehren" /&gt; The economic model of markets predicts the same of other commodities (like milk and wheat, for example): Artificially raising the price of the commodity tends to cause an increase in quantity supplied and a decrease in quantity demanded. The result is a surplus of the commodity. When there is a wheat surplus, the government buys it. Since the government does not hire surplus labor, the labor surplus takes the form of unemployment, which tends to be higher with minimum wage laws than without them.&lt;ref name="SowellBasic"/&gt;

The supply and demand model implies that by mandating a price floor above the equilibrium wage, minimum wage laws will cause unemployment.&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;{{cite book |last=McConnell |first=C. R. |first2=S. L. |last2=Brue |title=Economics |publisher=Irwin-McGraw Hill |year=1999 |edition=14th |page=594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GSSM"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gwartney |first=J. D. |first2=R.

A. |last4=Macpherson |title=Economics: Private and Public Choice |location= |publisher=Thomson South-Western |year=2003 |edition=10th |page=97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because a greater number of people are willing to work at the higher wage while a smaller number of jobs will be available at the higher wage. Companies can be more selective in those whom they employ thus the least skilled and least experienced will typically be excluded. An imposition or increase of a minimum wage will generally only affect employment in the low-skill labor market, as the equilibrium wage is already at or below the minimum wage, whereas in higher skill labor markets the equilibrium wage is too high for a change in minimum wage to affect employment.&lt;ref name="M"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mankiw |first=N.

===Monopsony===
[[File:Monopsony3.png|thumb|Modern economics suggests that a moderate minimum wage may increase employment as labor markets are [[Monopsony|monopsonistic]] and workers [[Inequality of bargaining power|lack bargaining power]].]]
{{Main|Monopsony}}
The supply and demand model predicts that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised, and hurts people who are not hired (or lose their jobs) when companies cut back on employment. But proponents of the minimum wage hold that the situation is much more complicated than the model can account for. One complicating factor is possible [[monopsony]] in the labor market, whereby the individual employer has some market power in determining wages paid. Thus it is at least theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment. Though single employer market power is unlikely to exist in most labor markets in the sense of the traditional '[[company town]],' asymmetric information, imperfect mobility, and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wage-setting power to most firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=William M. |last1=Boal |first2=Michael R |last2=Ransom |date=March 1997 |title=Monopsony in the Labor Market |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=35 |issue=1  |pages=86–112 |jstor=2729694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern economic theory predicts that although an excessive minimum wage may raise unemployment as it fixes a price above most demand for labor, a minimum wage at a more reasonable level can increase employment, and enhance growth and efficiency. This is because labor markets are [[Monopsony|monopsonistic]] and workers persistently [[Inequality of bargaining power|lack bargaining power]].  When poorer workers have more to spend it stimulates [[effective aggregate demand]] for goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. DE Card and AB Krueger, ''Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage'' (1995) and S Machin and A Manning, ‘Minimum wages and economic outcomes in Europe’ (1997) 41 European Economic Review 733&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rittenberg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rittenberg|first1=Timothy Tregarthen, Libby|title=Economics|year=1999|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781572594180|page=290|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HveHgrID5GYC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=monopsony+minimum+wage#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of the supply and demand model===
The argument that a minimum wage decreases employment is based on a simple supply and demand model of the labor market. A number of economists (for example [[Pierangelo Garegnani]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=P. |last1=Garegnani |title=Heterogeneous Capital, the Production Function and the Theory of Distribution |journal=The Review of Economic Studies |volume=37 |issue=3 |date=July 1970 |pages=407–36 |jstor=2296729 |doi=10.2307/2296729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert L. Vienneau,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.2005.00467.x |title=On Labour Demand and Equilibria of the Firm |year=2005 |last1=Vienneau |first1=Robert L. |journal=The Manchester School |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=612–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arrigo Opocher &amp; [[Ian Steedman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cje/bep005 |title=Input price-input quantity relations and the numeraire |year=2009 |last1=Opocher |first1=A. |last2=Steedman |first2=I. |journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=937–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;), building on the work of [[Piero Sraffa]], argue that that model, even given all its assumptions, is logically incoherent. Michael Anyadike-Danes and [[Wynne Godley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.1989.tb00809.x |title=Real Wages and Employment: A Sceptical View of Some Recent Empirical Work |year=1989 |last1=Anyadike-Danes |first1=Michael |last2=Godley |first2=Wynne |journal=The Manchester School |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=172–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue, based on simulation results, that little of the empirical work done with the textbook model constitutes a potentially [[Falsifiability|falsifiable theory]], and consequently empirical evidence hardly exists for that model. Graham White&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Graham |last1=White |title=The Poverty of Conventional Economic Wisdom and the Search for Alternative Economic and Social Policies |journal=The Drawing Board: An Australian Review of Public Affairs |volume=2 |issue=2 |date=November 2001 |pages=67–87 |url=http://www.australianreview.net/journal/v2/n2/white.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524091537/http://www.australianreview.net/journal/v2/n2/white.html |archivedate=24 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues, partially on the basis of Sraffianism, that the policy of increased [[labor market flexibility]], including the reduction of minimum wages, does not have an "intellectually coherent" argument in economic theory.[[File:Minimum to Average Wage for OECD Countries.png|thumb|Minimum wage levels in [[OECD]] countries as a share of average full-time wage, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIN2AVE|title=Minimum relative to average wages of full-time workers|first=|last=OECD|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502184031/http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=MIN2AVE|archivedate=2 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]Gary Fields, Professor of Labor Economics and Economics at [[Cornell University]], argues that the standard textbook model for the minimum wage is ambiguous, and that the standard theoretical arguments incorrectly measure only a one-sector market. Fields says a two-sector market, where "the self-employed, service workers, and farm workers are typically excluded from minimum-wage coverage... [and with] one sector with minimum-wage coverage and the other without it [and possible mobility between the two]," is the basis for better analysis. Through this model, Fields shows the typical theoretical argument to be ambiguous and says "the predictions derived from the textbook model definitely do not carry over to the two-sector case. Therefore, since a non-covered sector exists nearly everywhere, the predictions of the textbook model simply cannot be relied on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/01437729410059323 |title=The Unemployment Effects of Minimum Wages |year=1994 |last1=Fields |first1=Gary S. |journal=International Journal of Manpower |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=74–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate view of the labor market has low-wage labor markets characterized as [[monopsonistic competition]] wherein buyers (employers) have significantly more [[market power]] than do sellers (workers). This monopsony could be a result of intentional [[collusion]] between employers, or naturalistic factors such as [[Labor market segmentation|segmented markets]], [[search cost]]s, [[Information asymmetry|information costs]], [[Geographic mobility|imperfect mobility]] and the personal element of labor markets.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In such a case a simple supply and demand graph would not yield the [[market clearing|quantity of labor clearing]] and the wage rate. This is because while the upward sloping aggregate labor supply would remain unchanged, instead of using the upward labor supply curve shown in a supply and demand diagram, monopsonistic employers would use a steeper upward sloping curve corresponding to [[Marginal cost|marginal expenditures]] to yield the intersection with the supply curve resulting in a wage rate lower than would be the case under competition. Also, the amount of labor sold would also be lower than the competitive optimal allocation.

Such a case is a type of [[market failure]] and results in workers being paid less than their marginal value. Under the monopsonistic assumption, an appropriately set minimum wage could increase both [[wages]] and employment, with the optimal level being equal to the [[marginal product of labour|marginal product of labor]].&lt;ref name="Manning2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=Monopsony in motion: Imperfect Competition in Labor Markets |last=Manning |first=Alan |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691-11312-8 |pages= }}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view emphasizes the role of minimum wages as a [[regulated market|market regulation]] policy akin to [[antitrust]] policies, as opposed to an illusory "[[free lunch]]" for low-wage workers.

Another reason minimum wage may not affect employment in certain industries is that the demand for the product the employees produce is highly [[Price elasticity of demand|inelastic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gillespie, Andrew|title=Foundations of Economics|page=240|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if management is forced to increase wages, management can pass on the increase in wage to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since demand for the product is highly inelastic, consumers continue to buy the product at the higher price and so the manager is not forced to lay off workers. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argues this explanation neglects to explain why the firm was not charging this higher price absent the minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krugman |first=Paul|title=Economics|page=385|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three other possible reasons minimum wages do not affect employment were suggested by [[Alan Blinder]]: higher wages may reduce [[turnover (employment)|turnover]], and hence training costs; raising the minimum wage may "render moot" the potential problem of recruiting workers at a higher wage than current workers; and minimum wage workers might represent such a small proportion of a business's cost that the increase is too small to matter. He admits that he does not know if these are correct, but argues that "the list demonstrates that one can accept the new empirical findings and still be a card-carrying economist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alan S. |last=Blinder |title=The $5.15 Question |work=The New York Times |date=23 May 1996 |page=A29 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/23/opinion/the-5.15-question.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701015950/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/23/opinion/the-5.15-question.html |archivedate=1 July 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This disagreement usually takes the form of competing [[empirical]] tests of the [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticities]] of [[supply and demand]] in [[Labour economics|labor markets]] and the degree to which [[Market (economics)|markets]] differ from the efficiency that [[Economic model|models]] of [[perfect competition]] predict.

Economists have done empirical studies on different aspects of the minimum wage, including:&lt;ref name="Neumark" /&gt;
* Employment effects, the most frequently studied aspect
* Effects on the [[Income distribution|distribution of wages and earnings]] among low-paid and higher-paid workers
* Effects on the distribution of incomes among low-income and higher-income families
* Effects on the skills of workers through job training and the deferring of work to acquire education
* Effects on prices and profits
* Effects on [[on-the-job training]]
Until the mid-1990s, a general consensus existed among economists, both conservative and liberal, that the minimum wage reduced employment, especially among younger and low-skill workers.&lt;ref name="Card&amp;Krueger"&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Card |first2=Alan B. |last2=Krueger |title=Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1995 |pages=1, 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the basic supply-demand intuition, there were a number of empirical studies that supported this view. For example, [[Edward Gramlich|Gramlich]] (1976) found that many of the benefits went to higher income families, and that teenagers were made worse off by the unemployment associated with the minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gramlich | first1 = Edward M.  | year = 1976| title = Impact of Minimum Wages on Other Wages, Employment, and Family Incomes | url = | journal = Brookings Papers on Economic Activity | volume = 1976 | issue = 2| pages = 409–61 | doi = 10.2307/2534380 | last2 = Flanagan | first2 = Robert J. | last3 = Wachter | first3 = Michael L. | jstor = 2534380  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown et al. (1983) noted that time series studies to that point had found that for a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, there was a decrease in teenage employment of 1–3 percent. However, the studies found wider variation, from 0 to over 3 percent, in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment (teenagers without a job and looking for one). In contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram, it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force in response to the minimum wage, which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate. Using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations (using [[ordinary least squares]] vs. [[generalized least squares]] [[Regression analysis|regression procedures]], and linear vs. logarithmic specifications), they found that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage caused a 1 percent decrease in teenage employment, and no change in the teenage unemployment rate. The study also found a small, but statistically significant, increase in unemployment for adults aged 20–24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Charles |last1=Brown |first2=Curtis |last2=Gilroy |first3=Andrew |last3=Kohen |title=Time-Series Evidence of the Effect of the Minimum Wage on Youth Employment and Unemployment |journal=The Journal of Human Resources |volume=18 |issue=1 |date=Winter 1983 |pages=3–31 |jstor=145654 |doi=10.2307/145654}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:CBO Projected Effects of Minimum Wage Increases v1.png|thumb|right|CBO table illustrating projections of the effects of minimum wage increases on employment and income, under two scenarios]]

Wellington (1991) updated Brown et al.'s research with data through 1986 to provide new estimates encompassing a period when the real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) value of the minimum wage was declining, because it had not increased since 1981. She found that a 10% increase in the minimum wage decreased the absolute teenage employment by 0.6%, with no effect on the teen or young adult unemployment rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alison J. |last1=Wellington |title=Effects of the Minimum Wage on the Employment Status of Youths: An Update |journal=The Journal of Human Resources |volume=26 |issue=1 |date=Winter 1991 |pages=27–46 |jstor=145715 |doi=10.2307/145715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests that the unemployment effects of small minimum wage increases are dominated by other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/bp178 |title=Minimum wage trends: Understanding past and contemporary research |publisher=Economic Policy Institute |date=24 October 2006 |accessdate=6 December 2013 |first1=Liana |last1=Fox |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216010154/http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/bp178 |archivedate=16 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Florida, where voters approved an increase in 2004, a follow-up comprehensive study after the increase confirmed a strong economy with increased employment above previous years in Florida and better than in the US as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.risep-fiu.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/FL-Minimum-Wage.pdf |title=The Florida Minimum Wage: Good for Workers, Good for the Economy |accessdate=3 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622155415/http://www.risep-fiu.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/FL-Minimum-Wage.pdf |archivedate=22 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to on-the-job training, some believe the increase in wages is taken out of training expenses.

Some empirical studies have tried to ascertain the benefits of a minimum wage beyond employment effects. In an analysis of census data, Joseph Sabia and Robert Nielson found no statistically significant evidence that minimum wage increases helped reduce financial, housing, health, or food insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.epionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/120228_EPI_CanRaisingtheMinWageReducePovertyandHardship.pdf |first1=Joseph J. |last1=Sabia |first2=Robert B. |last2=Nielsen |year=2012 |title=Can Raising the Minimum Wage Reduce Poverty and Hardship? |publisher=Employment Policies Institute |page=4 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108191101/https://www.epionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/120228_EPI_CanRaisingtheMinWageReducePovertyandHardship.pdf |archivedate=8 January 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was undertaken by the [[Employment Policies Institute]], a think tank funded by the food, beverage and hospitality industries.

''[[The Economist]]'' wrote in December 2013: "A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs....America's federal minimum wage, at 38% of median income, is one of the rich world's lowest. Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none finds any serious damage. ... High minimum wages, however, particularly in rigid labour markets, do appear to hit employment. France has the rich world’s highest wage floor, at more than 60% of the median for adults and a far bigger fraction of the typical wage for the young. This helps explain why France also has shockingly high rates of youth unemployment: 26% for 15- to 24-year-olds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21591593-moderate-minimum-wages-do-more-good-harm-they-should-be-set-technocrats-not|title=The logical floor|journal=The Economist|date=14 December 2013|via=The Economist|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801064646/http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21591593-moderate-minimum-wages-do-more-good-harm-they-should-be-set-technocrats-not|archivedate=1 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Card and Krueger===
In 1992, the minimum wage in New Jersey increased from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour (an 18.8% increase), while in the adjacent state of Pennsylvania it remained at $4.25. [[David Card]] and [[Alan B. Krueger|Alan Krueger]] gathered information on fast food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania in an attempt to see what effect this increase had on employment within New Jersey. A basic supply and demand model predicts that relative employment should have decreased in New Jersey. Card and Krueger surveyed employers before the April 1992 New Jersey increase, and again in November–December 1992, asking managers for data on the full-time equivalent staff level of their restaurants both times.&lt;ref name="Card &amp; Krueger 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Card |first2=Alan B. |last2=Krueger |title=Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=84 |issue=4 |date=September 1994 |pages=772–93 |jstor=2118030|url=http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp017d278t020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on data from the employers' responses, the authors concluded that the increase in the minimum wage slightly increased employment in the New Jersey restaurants.&lt;ref name="Card &amp; Krueger 1994" /&gt;

Card and Krueger expanded on this initial article in their 1995 book ''Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-691-04823-1}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the negative employment effects of minimum wage laws are minimal if not non-existent. For example, they look at the 1992 increase in New Jersey's minimum wage, the 1988 rise in California's minimum wage, and the 1990–91 increases in the federal minimum wage. In addition to their own findings, they reanalyzed earlier studies with updated data, generally finding that the older results of a negative employment effect did not hold up in the larger datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Card | first1 =  | last2 = Krueger | first2 =  | year = 2000 | title = Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: Reply | url = | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 90 | issue = 5| pages = 1397–420 | doi=10.1257/aer.90.5.1397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[David Neumark]] and William Wascher reexamined Card and Krueger's result using administrative [[payroll|payroll records]] from a sample of large fast food restaurant chains, and reported that minimum wage increases were followed by decreases in employment. An assessment of data collected and analyzed by Neumark and Wascher did not initially contradict the Card and Krueger results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Minimum Wage and Job Loss |first=John |last=Schmitt |date=1 January 1996 |url=http://www.epi.org/publication/epi_virlib_briefingpapers_1996_minimumw/ |publisher=Economic Policy Institute |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329035236/http://www.epi.org/publication/epi_virlib_briefingpapers_1996_minimumw/ |archivedate=29 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in a later edited version they found a four percent decrease in employment, and reported that "the estimated disemployment effects in the payroll data are often statistically significant at the 5- or 10-percent level although there are some estimators and subsamples that yield insignificant—although almost always negative" employment effects.&lt;ref name="AER"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Neumark |first2=William |last2=Wascher |title=Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: Comment |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=90 |issue=5 |date=December 2000 |pages=1362–96 |jstor=2677855 |doi=10.1257/aer.90.5.1362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidson.edu/academic/economics/foley/eco324_s06/Neumark_Wascher%20AER%20(2000).pdf{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}} {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neumark and Wascher's conclusions were subsequently rebutted in a 2000 paper by Card and Krueger.&lt;ref&gt;Card and Krueger (2000) "Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: Reply" American Economic Review, Volume 90 No. 5. pg 1397-1420&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 paper has reconciled the difference between Card and Krueger's survey data and Neumark and Wascher's payroll-based data.

In 1996 and 1997, the federal minimum wage was increased from $4.25 to $5.15, thereby increasing the minimum wage by $0.90 in Pennsylvania but by just $0.10 in New Jersey; this allowed for an examination of the effects of minimum wage increases in the same area, subsequent to the 1992 change studied by Card and Krueger. A study by Hoffman and Trace found the result anticipated by traditional theory: a detrimental effect on employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1057/eej.2008.1 |title=NJ and PA Once Again: What Happened to Employment when the PA–NJ Minimum Wage Differential Disappeared? |year=2009 |last1=Hoffman |first1=Saul D |last2=Trace |first2=Diane M |journal=Eastern Economic Journal |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=115–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further application of the methodology used by Card and Krueger by other researchers yielded results similar to their original findings, across additional data sets.&lt;ref name="Dube" /&gt; A 2010 study by three economists (Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, William Lester of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Michael Reich of the University of California, Berkeley), compared adjacent counties in different states where the minimum wage had been raised in one of the states. They analyzed employment trends for several categories of low-wage workers from 1990 to 2006 and found that increases in minimum wages had no negative effects on low-wage employment and successfully increased the income of workers in food services and retail employment, as well as the narrower category of workers in restaurants.&lt;ref name="Dube"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Arindrajit |last1=Dube |first2=T.

===Statistical meta-analyses===
Several researchers have conducted statistical [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] of the employment effects of the minimum wage. In 1995, Card and Krueger analyzed 14 earlier [[Time series|time-series studies]] on minimum wages and concluded that there was clear evidence of [[publication bias]] (in favor of studies that found a statistically significant negative employment effect). They point out that later studies, which had more data and lower standard errors, did not show the expected increase in [[t-statistic]] (almost all the studies had a t-statistic of about two, just above the level of [[statistical significance]] at the .05 level).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Card |first2=Alan B. |last2=Krueger |date=May 1995 |title=Time-Series Minimum-Wage Studies: A Meta-analysis |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=238–43 |jstor=2117925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though a serious methodological indictment, opponents of the minimum wage largely ignored this issue; as Thomas Leonard noted, "The silence is fairly deafening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1215/00182702-32-Suppl_1-117 |title=The Very Idea of Applying Economics: The Modern Minimum-Wage Controversy and Its Antecedents |year=2000 |last1=Leonard |first1=T.

In 2005, T.D. Stanley showed that Card and Krueger's results could signify either publication bias or the absence of a minimum wage effect. However, using a different methodology, Stanley concluded that there is evidence of publication bias and that correction of this bias shows no relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0950-0804.2005.00250.x |title=Beyond Publication Bias |year=2005 |last1=Stanley |first1=T. D. |journal=Journal of Economic Surveys |volume=19 |issue=3 |page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Hristos Doucouliagos and T.D. Stanley conducted a similar meta-analysis of 64 U.S. studies on disemployment effects and concluded that Card and Krueger's initial claim of publication bias is still correct. Moreover, they concluded, "Once this publication selection is corrected, little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment remains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8543.2009.00723.x |title=Publication Selection Bias in Minimum-Wage Research?

==Debate over consequences==
Minimum wage laws affect workers in most low-paid fields of employment&lt;ref name="Neumark" /&gt; and have usually been judged against the criterion of reducing poverty.&lt;ref name="Palgrave1987"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eatwell | first = John, Ed. | authorlink = |author2=Murray Milgate |author3=Peter Newman  | title = The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics | publisher = The Macmillan Press Limited | year = 1987 | location = London | pages = 476–78 | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-333-37235-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minimum wage laws receive less support from economists than from the general public. Despite decades of experience and economic research, debates about the costs and benefits of minimum wages continue today.&lt;ref name="Neumark" /&gt;

Various groups have great ideological, political, financial, and emotional investments in issues surrounding minimum wage laws. For example, agencies that administer the laws have a vested interest in showing that "their" laws do not create unemployment, as do labor unions whose members' finances are protected by minimum wage laws. On the other side of the issue, low-wage employers such as restaurants finance the Employment Policies Institute, which has released numerous studies opposing the minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Harry |last1=Bernstein |title=Troubling Facts on Employment |work=Los Angeles Times |date=15 September 1992 |page=D3 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-15/business/fi-836_1_part-time-jobs |accessdate=6 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217204239/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-15/business/fi-836_1_part-time-jobs |archivedate=17 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Erik |last1=Engquist |date=May 2006 |title=Health bill fight nears showdown |journal=Crain's New York Business |volume=22 |issue=20 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these powerful groups and factors means that the debate on the issue is not always based on dispassionate analysis. Additionally, it is extraordinarily difficult to separate the effects of minimum wage from all the other variables that affect employment.&lt;ref name="SowellBasic" /&gt;

A widely circulated argument that the minimum wage was ineffective at reducing poverty was provided by [[George Stigler]] in 1949:
* Employment may fall more than in proportion to the wage increase, thereby reducing overall earnings;
* As uncovered sectors of the economy absorb workers released from the covered sectors, the decrease in wages in the uncovered sectors may exceed the increase in wages in the covered ones;
* The impact of the minimum wage on family income distribution may be negative unless the fewer but better jobs are allocated to members of needy families rather than to, for example, teenagers from families not in poverty;
* Forbidding employers to pay less than a legal minimum is equivalent to forbidding workers to sell their labor for less than the minimum wage. The legal restriction that employers cannot pay less than a legislated wage is equivalent to the legal restriction that workers cannot work at all in the protected sector unless they can find employers willing to hire them at that wage.&lt;ref name="Palgrave1987" /&gt;
In 2006, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) argued that the minimum wage could not be directly linked to unemployment in countries that have suffered job losses.&lt;ref name="ILO 2006" /&gt; In April 2010, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) released a report arguing that countries could alleviate teen unemployment by "lowering the cost of employing low-skilled youth" through a sub-minimum training wage.&lt;ref&gt;Scarpetta, Stephano, Anne Sonnet and Thomas Manfredi,''Rising Youth Unemployment During The Crisis: How To Prevent Negative Long-Term Consequences on a Generation?'', 14 April 2010 [http://www.olis.oecd.org/olis/2010doc.nsf/LinkTo/NT000028DE/$FILE/JT03281808.PDF (read-only PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105115117/http://www.olis.oecd.org/olis/2010doc.nsf/LinkTo/NT000028DE/$FILE/JT03281808.PDF |date=5 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of U.S. states showed that businesses' annual and average payrolls grow faster and employment grew at a faster rate in states with a minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;Fiscal Policy Institute, "States with Minimum Wages Above the Federal Level have had Faster Small Business and Retail Job Growth," 30 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The study showed a correlation, but did not claim to prove causation.

The dollar value of the minimum wage loses purchasing power over time due to inflation. Minimum wage laws, for instance proposals to index the minimum wage to average wages, have the potential to keep the dollar value of the minimum wage relevant and predictable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epi.org/files/page/-/pdf/bp251.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the economic effects of introducing minimum wage legislation in Germany in January 2015, recent developments have shown that the feared increase in unemployment has not materialized, however, in some economic sectors and regions of the country, it came to a decline in job opportunities particularly for temporary and part-time workers, and some low-wage jobs have disappeared entirely.&lt;ref&gt;C.

==Surveys of economists==
According to a 1978 article in the ''[[American Economic Review]]'', 90% of the economists surveyed agreed that the minimum wage increases unemployment among low-skilled workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J.

A similar survey in 2006 by Robert Whaples polled PhD members of the [[American Economic Association]] (AEA). Whaples found that 47% respondents wanted the minimum wage eliminated, 38% supported an increase, 14% wanted it kept at the current level, and 1% wanted it decreased.&lt;ref name="Whaples 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2202/1553-3832.1156 |title=Do Economists Agree on Anything?

Surveys of labor economists have found a sharp split on the minimum wage. Fuchs et al. (1998) polled labor economists at the top 40 research universities in the United States on a variety of questions in the summer of 1996. Their 65 respondents were nearly evenly divided when asked if the minimum wage should be increased. They argued that the different policy views were not related to views on whether raising the minimum wage would reduce teen employment (the median economist said there would be a reduction of 1%), but on value differences such as income redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Victor R. |last1=Fuchs |first2=Alan B. |last2=Krueger |first3=James M. |last3=Poterba |date=September 1998 |title=Economists' Views about Parameters, Values, and Policies: Survey Results in Labor and Public Economics |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=1387–425 |jstor=2564804}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel B. Klein]] and Stewart Dompe conclude, on the basis of previous surveys, "the average level of support for the minimum wage is somewhat higher among labor economists than among AEA members."&lt;ref name="Klein &amp; Dompe 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klein |first1=Daniel |first2=Stewart |last2=Dompe |title=Reasons for Supporting the Minimum Wage: Asking Signatories of the 'Raise the Minimum Wage' Statement |date=January 2007 |journal=Economics in Practice |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=125–67 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/reasons-for-supporting-the-minimum-wage-asking-signatories-of-the-raise-the-minimum-wage-statement |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213221725/http://econjwatch.org/articles/reasons-for-supporting-the-minimum-wage-asking-signatories-of-the-raise-the-minimum-wage-statement |archivedate=13 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Klein and Dompe conducted a non-anonymous survey of supporters of the minimum wage who had signed the "Raise the Minimum Wage" statement published by the [[Economic Policy Institute]]. 95 of the 605 signatories responded. They found that a majority signed on the grounds that it transferred income from employers to workers, or equalized bargaining power between them in the labor market. In addition, a majority considered disemployment to be a moderate potential drawback to the increase they supported.&lt;ref name="Klein &amp; Dompe 2007" /&gt;

In 2013, a diverse group of 37 economics professors was surveyed on their view of the minimum wage's impact on employment. 34% of respondents agreed with the statement, "Raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour would make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment." 32% disagreed and the remaining respondents were uncertain or had no opinion on the question. 47% agreed with the statement, "The distortionary costs of raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour and indexing it to inflation are sufficiently small compared with the benefits to low-skilled workers who can find employment that this would be a desirable policy", while 11% disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_br0IEq5a9E77NMV |title=Minimum Wage |publisher=[[IGM Forum]] |date=26 February 2013 |accessdate=6 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821030142/http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_br0IEq5a9E77NMV |archivedate=21 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
Economists and other political commentators have proposed alternatives to the minimum wage. They argue that these alternatives may address the issue of poverty better than a minimum wage, as it would benefit a broader population of low wage earners, not cause any unemployment, and distribute the costs widely rather than concentrating it on employers of low wage workers.

===Basic income===
{{main|Basic Income}}
A [[basic income]] (or [[negative income tax]]) is a system of [[social security]] that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on frugally. It is argued that recipients of the basic income would have considerably more bargaining power when negotiating a wage with an employer as there would be no risk of destitution for not taking the employment. As a result, the jobseeker could spend more time looking for a more appropriate or satisfying job, or they could wait until a higher-paying job appeared. Alternatively, they could spend more time increasing their skills in university, which would make them more suitable for higher-paying jobs, as well as provide numerous other benefits. Experiments on Basic Income and NIT in Canada and the USA show that people spent more time studying while the program was running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2014/08/25/a-universal-basic-income-and-work-incentives-part-2-evidence/|title=EconoMonitor|first=Designed &amp; Developed by Monkey Do, LLC ::|last=http://monkeydo.biz|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923224115/http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2014/08/25/a-universal-basic-income-and-work-incentives-part-2-evidence/|archivedate=23 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents argue that a basic income that is based on a broad tax base would be more economically efficient, as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers, causing [[deadweight loss|losses in efficiency]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Guaranteed minimum income===
A [[guaranteed minimum income]] is another proposed system of [[social welfare provision]]. It is similar to a basic income or negative income tax system, except that it is normally conditional and subject to a means test. Some proposals also stipulate a willingness to participate in the [[labor market]], or a willingness to perform [[community services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=67osAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vgkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=766,4664677&amp;dq=guaranteed+minimum+income+labor+market&amp;hl=en |title=Suggestion: Raise welfare children in institutions |first=|last=|website=Star-News |year=28 January 1972 |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refundable tax credit===
A [[refundable tax credit]] is a mechanism whereby the tax system can reduce the tax owed by a household to below zero, and result in a net payment to the taxpayer beyond their own payments into the tax system. Examples of refundable tax credits include the [[earned income tax credit]] and the additional [[child tax credit]] in the US, and [[working tax credit]]s and [[child tax credit]]s in the UK. Such a system is slightly different from a [[negative income tax]], in that the refundable tax credit is usually only paid to households that have earned at least some income.  This policy is more targeted against poverty than the minimum wage, because it avoids subsidizing low-income workers who are supported by high-income households (for example, teenagers still living with their parents).&lt;ref name="wbur"&gt;{{cite news|title=What The Research Says In The Minimum Wage Debate|agency=WBUR|date=28 April 2014|author=David Scharfenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, earned income tax credit rates, also known as EITC or EIC, vary by state—some are refundable while other states do not allow a refundable tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateeitc.com/map/index.asp|title=50 State Resources Map on State EITCs|publisher=The Hatcher Group|accessdate=16 June 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423021254/http://www.stateeitc.com/map/index.asp|archivedate=23 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal EITC program has been expanded by a number of presidents including Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W.

The [[Adam Smith Institute]] prefers cutting taxes on the poor and middle class instead of raising wages as an alternative to the minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/news/press-releases/comment-minimum-wage-rise-risks-harming-workers-cut-taxes-on-the-poor-instead |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142735/http://www.adamsmith.org/news/press-releases/comment-minimum-wage-rise-risks-harming-workers-cut-taxes-on-the-poor-instead |archivedate=13 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective bargaining===
Italy, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark are examples of developed nations where there is no minimum wage that is required by legislation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141027-LA" /&gt; Such nations, particularly the Nordics, have very high union participation rates.&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;Olson, Parmy (9/01/2009).

"Low-wage employment subsidies versus the welfare state." ''The American Economic Review'' 84.2 (1994): 54-58.&lt;/ref&gt; advocate a wage subsidy program. A wage subsidy is a payment made by a government for work people do. It is based either on an hourly basis or by income earned. Advocates argue that the primary deficiencies of the EITC and the minimum wage are best avoided by a wage subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/wage-subsidy-better-way-help-poor-7778.html|title=The Wage Subsidy: A Better Way to Help the Poor {{!}} Manhattan Institute|date=25 September 2015|work=Manhattan Institute|access-date=11 August 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811230231/https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/wage-subsidy-better-way-help-poor-7778.html|archivedate=11 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/08/19/wage-subsidies-are-better-than-raising-the-minimum-wage|title=A Better Wage Hike|last=Cass|first=Oren|date=19 August 2015|website=US NEWS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820110346/http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/08/19/wage-subsidies-are-better-than-raising-the-minimum-wage|archive-date=20 August 2015|dead-url=yes|access-date=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the wage subsidy in the United States suffers from a lack of political support from either major [[political parties in the United States|political party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/wage-subsidies.html|title=Noahpinion: Wage subsidies|last=Smith|first=Noah|date=7 December 2013|website=Noahpinion|access-date=11 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811224635/http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/wage-subsidies.html|archivedate=11 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/12/wage-subsidies-might-be-good-idea-republicans-will-never-support-it/|title=Wage subsidies might be a good idea, but Republicans will never support it|last=Drum|first=Kevin|date=3 December 2013|work=Mother Jones|access-date=11 August 2017|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811224733/https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/12/wage-subsidies-might-be-good-idea-republicans-will-never-support-it/|archivedate=11 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions from former McDonald's USA Ed Rensi about raising minimum wage to $15 is to completely push humans out of the picture when it comes to labor if they are to pay minimum wage at $15 they would look into replacing humans with machines as that would be the more cost-effective than having employees that are ineffective. During an interview on FOX Business Network’s Mornings with Maria, he stated that he believes an increase to $15 an hour would cause job loss at an extraordinary level. Rensi also believes it does not only affect the fast food industry, franchising he sees as the best business model in the United States, it is dependent on people that have low job skills that have to grow and if you cannot pay them a reasonable wage then they are going to be replaced with machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/05/24/fmr-mcdonalds-usa-ceo-35k-robots-cheaper-than-hiring-at-15-per-hour.html|title=Fmr.

'''Peter Cozens''' was the Director of the [[Centre for Strategic Studies New Zealand]] from 2002 until 2009 when he retired. The Centre is part of the School of Government at [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. As Director, Cozens promoted and contributes to research and discussion of New Zealand's strategic security environment.

==Biography==
Cozens grew up and attended school in the [[United Kingdom]].{{cn|date=July 2017}} From 1964 to 1972 he served in the [[British India Steam Navigation Company]].{{cn|date=July 2017}} He saw service in the company's cadetship, general cargo ships, passenger and cruise liners and consequently visited many ports of call in the Indian Ocean and in Asia. From 1972 to 1993 he served in the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] and saw service in both the Pacific and Indian Oceans, retiring at the rank of Commander.{{cn|date=July 2017}} He studied at the Royal Australian Naval Staff College and Victoria University where he researched Asian culture and civilisation, graduating with a Master of Arts.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In 1995 he was appointed as Administrator (or in some references Operations Manager) at the Centre for Strategic Studies under original Director [[Terence O'Brien (New Zealand diplomat)|Terence O'Brien]].{{cn|date=July 2017}} Following the departure of [[David Dickens]] in 2002, Cozens was promoted to Director. He also served as Executive Director of the New Zealand Membership Committee of the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific (CSCAP).

==Current activities==
He is an advocate for non-official or [[track two diplomacy]]. In a submission to the New Zealand government's 'Seriously Asia' conference in 2003, he expressed concerns about the country's commitment to understanding Asia. In particular, he lamented the lack of resources allocated to the work of think-tanks and track two organizations. Cozens has been quoted as saying the [[New Zealand Defence Force]] also needs to increase its expertise, in particular that there is a "need to lift the academic ability of our officer cadre: this is well overdue for real professional development."&lt;ref&gt;Denis Welch, "The disarming of New Zealand", The Listener, 29 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As former Executive Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies, Cozens' duties include directing research, giving speeches, providing media commentary and contributing to the School of Government's Masters of Strategic Studies degree. He managed several full-time staff members, and also oversees a number of the Centre's Senior Fellows, including former director [[Terence O'Brien (New Zealand diplomat)|Terence O'Brien]], [[University of Auckland]] academic Stephen Hoadley, and Lance Beath. Cozens has also increasingly found himself raising money to support the Centre's activities.

He is also a Fellow of the Asia/Pacific Research Institute of New Zealand and serves on the Editorial Board of the Sea Power Centre - Australia working paper series.

==Views on security issues==

Cozens has outlined his own views on strategic policy and security issues in numerous papers and books on terrorism, security and maritime cooperation in the Pacific-Asian region. In a 2005 newspaper interview, he called for a "softly softly, catchy monkey" approach to counter-terrorism, saying it would "reward authorities more than a 'reds under the bed', or 'terrorist under the bed' approach."&lt;ref&gt;"Civil rights at risk in terror backlash," The New Zealand Herald, 29 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an Australian report that warned about future resource competition in the [[Antarctic]], Cozens said the [[New Zealand]] Government "should think in terms of increasing New Zealand's military presence" near the south pole.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Field and David Dickens, "Fears of Cold War in the Antarctic" The Dominion-Post, 7 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was not welcomed by the New Zealand Defence Force. In an article in the Australian journal 'Security Challenges' he argued that the [[New Zealand Defence Force]] should be renamed the "Armed Services of New Zealand" to reflect the fact that it increasingly performs a range of non-traditional functions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cozens, "Some reflections on the notion of defence and the use of armed force: a perspective from New Zealand", Security Challenges, vol.2, no. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Cozens' views have not found universal support. A letter to [[New Zealand Listener|The Listener]] magazine in May 2006 described him as an "ex-navy wallah" who needs his "head read".&lt;ref&gt;"Letters, The Listener, 13–19 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health issues==

In early 2007 Peter Cozens was taken to hospital for stress related heart problems related to overwork. He recovered well. In 2009, he retired.

'''Abdull Ghafar Khan''' (born 21 July 1962), better known as '''Phillip Khan''', is a Hong Kong businessman and political activist. A [[Pakistanis in Hong Kong|Pakistani national born and raised in Hong Kong]], Khan's ambitions to stand for election to [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|the city's Legislative Council]] reportedly have been blocked by the refusal of the [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] to consider his application for [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China#Hong Kong|naturalisation as a Chinese national]].&lt;ref name="MingPao20120814"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sina.com.hk/news/3/1/1/2744005/1.html|title=香港仔巴漢申特區護照被拒 (Aberdeen Pakistani man's application for SAR passport refused)|work=[[Ming Pao]]|date=14 August 2012|accessdate=14 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130107210240/http://news.sina.com.hk/news/3/1/1/2744005/1.html|archivedate=7 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Khan concurrently holds [[Pakistani nationality law|Pakistani nationality]] and [[British National (Overseas)]] status. His father came to Hong Kong in 1915, when the city was still [[British Hong Kong|ruled by the British Empire]].&lt;ref name="MingPao20120814"/&gt; His uncle served in the [[Hong Kong Police Force]], and was killed in a bombing in 1944 during [[World War II]]. After the war, his father settled in [[Diamond Hill]], where he ran a dairy farm. Khan himself was born in Hong Kong in 1962 and studied at the former Mansfield College in [[Knutsford Terrace]], [[Tsim Sha Tsui]]; he was the only member of his class not of Chinese ethnicity, and thus became fluent in [[Cantonese]]. He graduated in 1976.&lt;ref name="RTHK20121015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://programme.rthk.org.hk/rthk/tv/programme.php?name=tv/hkcc&amp;p=858&amp;d=2012-10-15&amp;e=193706&amp;m=episode|author=李君萍 (Lee Kwan-ping)|title=身份不明 (Unclear Identities)|work=[[Radio Television Hong Kong]]|date=15 October 2012|accessdate=20 April 2013|post=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, when the [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong#1980s and 1990s|wave of emigration from Hong Kong]] was reaching its peak, Khan made the decision to remain in Hong Kong, stating that he saw it as his home.&lt;ref name="MingPao20120814"/&gt; He runs a trading company, due to which he travels frequently to [[Shenzhen]] for business and speaks [[Mandarin Chinese]] as well.&lt;ref name="RTHK20121015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1013818/businessman-philip-khan-born-hong-kong-cannot-get-passport|first=Simpson|last=Cheung|title=Businessman Phillip Khan born in Hong Kong cannot get passport|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=14 August 2012|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/news-38732.html|last=Li|first=Xueying|title=Minorities facing challenges in HK|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=12 November 2012|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 Minibond protests==
Khan suffered financial losses in the September 2008 [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] due to his investments in so-called "[[Minibond]]s" – structured financial products similar to [[equity-linked note]]s which were marketed to many members of the Hong Kong public with claims of being a safe and low-risk product. In the aftermath, he became involved in efforts to gain compensation for affected noteholders. In November 2008, Khan organised a protest march from [[Sogo]] Department Store in [[Causeway Bay]] to the [[Central Government Offices]] in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]]; attendees shouted slogans calling for then-Chief Executive of Hong Kong [[Donald Tsang]] to step down and criticising the opacity of the banks' operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://life.mingpao.com/cfm/dailynews3b.cfm?File=20091102/nalgd/gda1.txt|title=網民圍禮賓府被阻截 不滿政府漠視基層 喊特首下台 (Internet users blocked from surrounding Government House; dissatisfied with government's neglect of grassroots, call for Chief Executive to step down)|work=[[Ming Pao]]|date=2 November 2009|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, when former US president [[Bill Clinton]] visited Hong Kong for the first annual meeting of the [[Clinton Foundation]], Khan organised protests outside of the [[Grand Hyatt Hong Kong]] where Clinton was staying, in an attempt to draw attention to the issue. Roughly 90 people attended the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sina.com.hk/cgi-bin/nw/show.cgi/2/1/1/961103/1.html|title=90苦主向克林頓請願不果 (Ninety debtholders fruitlessly petition Clinton)|work=Oriental Daily News|date=4 December 2008|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan continued leading protest activities throughout 2009 and 2010. In January 2009, Khan and four fellow protestors collected signatures from over two thousand affected noteholders and set off for neighbouring [[Macau]] to submit a petition to then-[[Vice-President of the People's Republic of China]] [[Xi Jinping]], who was visiting the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/expressnews/20090110/news_20090110_55_551406.htm|title=5名雷曼苦主準備乘船往澳門向習近平表達不滿 (Five Lehman debtholders prepare to board a boat to Macau to express their dissatisfaction to Xi Jinping)|work=[[Radio Television Hong Kong]]|date=10 January 2009|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, after [[Standard Chartered]] admitted that they had made errors in estimating the risk associated with Minibonds, Khan led a protest outside of the [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|Legislative Council Building]], during which he stood in the middle of the street in an attempt to block a Standard Chartered company bus from departing the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.hk.msn.com/local/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3895023|title=渣打高層認錯估雷曼倒閉風險 (Standard Chartered executives admit error in estimating Lehman's risk of collapse)|work=Oriental Daily News|date=8 May 2010|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naturalisation attempts==
Khan has twice attempted to submit applications to the [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] for naturalisation as a Chinese national; however, each time, the immigration officer on duty refused to accept his papers, stating that he did not have a close relative who was a Chinese national.&lt;ref name="AppleDaily20121213"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20121213/18099692|title=植根港百年 巴漢被拒入籍 入境處原因：沒有近親是中國人 (Rooted in Hong Kong for a hundred years, Pakistani man's naturalisation refused; Immigration Department reason: does not have close Chinese relative)|work=[[Apple Daily]]|date=13 December 2012|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an Immigration Department spokesperson, applications will be taken from all persons submitting them, but under the {{HKOrd|name=Chinese Nationality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance|540|5}}, the Department is not required to inform the applicant of the reason for rejection.&lt;ref name="MingPao20120814"/&gt; His inability to naturalise has also meant he cannot obtain a [[Home Return Permit]] for travel to mainland China; instead, he has to use his passport, waiting in line at immigration control at [[Luohu Port]] for more than half an hour each time and quickly running out of pages for [[passport stamp]]s, requiring him to pay additional fees to add pages to his passport or renew it.&lt;ref name="RTHK20121015"/&gt;

News of Khan's troubles prompted [[Equal Opportunities Commission (Hong Kong)|Equal Opportunities Commission]] Chairman [[Lam Woon-kwong]] to write a letter of concern to the Immigration Department.&lt;ref name="MingPao20120814"/&gt; In December 2012, Khan organised public protests over the issue, marching and holding signs at the [[Central Government Complex, Tamar|Central Government Complex in Tamar]] with roughly twenty other South Asians whose applications for naturalisation had similarly been rejected.&lt;ref name="AppleDaily20121213"/&gt;

==Other activities==
In the early 2000s, Khan participated in a number of Hong Kong political activities, including the [[Hong Kong 1 July marches]] against [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Basic Law Article 23]] security legislation, as well as candlelight vigils in [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong|Victoria Park]] in memory of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].&lt;ref name="MingPao20120814"/&gt; He has also spoken out against the Hong Kong [[Education Bureau]]'s refusal to develop a local Chinese-as-a-second-language curriculum for students from non-Chinese-speaking households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.now.com/home/local/player?newsId=62775|title=南亞裔港人：不懂中文等如「殘廢」 (Hong Kong South Asian man: not understanding Chinese like being "handicapped")|work=Now News|date=19 March 2013|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|maternal health}}

'''Pre-conception counseling''' (also called '''pre-conceptual counseling''') is a meeting with a health-care professional (generally a [[physician]] or [[midwife]]) by a woman ''before'' attempting to become [[pregnant]]. It generally includes a '''pre-conception risk assessment''' for any potential [[complications of pregnancy]] as well as modifications of risk factors, such as increasing folic acid intake to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and counseling on smoking cessation, alcohol reduction, and medications that may compromise fetal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Letitia |author2=Zapata |author3=D'Angelo |author4=Harrison |author5=Morrow|title=Associations between preconception counseling and maternal behaviors before and during pregnancy|journal=Matern Child Health J|year=2012|volume=16|pages=1854–1861|doi=10.1007/s10995-011-0932-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians, midwives and baby experts recommend that a woman visit them as soon as the woman is contemplating having a child, and optimally around 3 to 6 months before actual attempts are made to conceive.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} This time frame allows a woman to better prepare her body for successful conception ([[fertilization]]) and pregnancy, and allows her to reduce any health risks which are within her control. Agencies such as the [[March of Dimes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/getting-healthy-before-pregnancy.aspx |title=Get Ready for Pregnancy |publisher=March of Dimes |date=October 2013 |accessdate=2014-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed [[screening (medicine)|screening]] tools that healthcare providers can use with their patients. In addition, obstetricians or [[midwives]] (see [[Obstetrics]], [[Midwifery]], [[General Practitioner]]) have developed comprehensive check-lists and assessments for the woman who is planning to become pregnant.

In one sense, pre-conception counseling and assessment can be compared to a [[well-baby visit]] in which a baby is screened for normal health, normal development, with the benefit of identifying emerging problems that may have gone unnoticed in an infant. For a woman, the Pre-Conception Counseling Assessment and Screening is intended to assess normal health of a child-bearing woman, while at the same time identifying:

*Existing or emerging illness or disease which may have gone undetected before, and
*Existing risks for the woman who may become pregnant, and
*Existing risks which may affect a fetus if the woman does become pregnant.

==Obstacles to pre-conception counseling==
{{Globalize|date=December 2010}}
A common obstacle to pre-conception counseling and assessment is that many pregnancies are still unplanned.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Globally, 38% of pregnancies are unintended.&lt;ref name=speidel&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Speidel JJ, Harper CC, Shields WC |title=The potential of long-acting reversible contraception to decrease unintended pregnancy |journal=Contraception |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=197–200 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18692608 |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, many experts recommend that all women of childbearing age be offered preconception care counseling regardless of intent to become pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coffey|first=Kevan|author2=Shorten, Allison|title=The challenge of preconception counseling: Using reproductive life planning in primary care|journal=Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners|date=22 August 2013|volume=00|page=108|doi=10.1002/2327-6924.12054|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2327-6924.12054/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common obstacle to pre-conception counseling and assessment is of women not knowing, realizing, or understanding the benefits of visiting their physician or [[midwife]] before trying to become pregnant. Most women still take for granted the biological aspects of becoming pregnant, and do not consider the value of pre-screening before becoming pregnant. Most women who want and anticipate having a baby are naturally prone to thinking in terms of having a well baby. In the majority of cases, women do not think about having a baby who has any kind of problem. Most women do not know how their own medical history could pose risks to a developing [[fetus]]. Likewise, they may not understand that pregnancy carries a certain number of risks as well. When family history risks and pregnancy risks are considered together, it may point to potential problems for that particular woman, or to her unborn baby once she becomes pregnant.

==What is involved in pre-conception counseling?==

===Questionnaire===
Pre-screening covers many body-system areas (not just the reproductive organs), as well as aspects of the woman's lifestyle, and family history information. It begins with basic information and becomes more in-depth, especially if the woman has had previous illnesses, diseases, etc. Pre-screening assessments begin with a questionnaire which the woman fills out, generally before seeing the physician or [[midwife]]. Some offices have the woman go over parts of the questionnaire with a [[Nurse Practitioner]], if available.

===Blood work===
Certain blood work may be ordered. This often includes a [[Complete blood count|CBC]] (Complete Blood Count) which can show [[anemia]]. A CBC includes [[White blood cell|WBC]] (White Blood Cell Count) which can show the presence of infection. Anemia and infection, indicating problems with the woman's overall health at that moment, can both affect a woman's ability to become pregnant at that time as well as affect the stability of the pregnancy and health of the fetus. In the majority of cases both infection and anemia can be treated once the cause is identified. Anemia may require ongoing evaluation and iron supplement.

===Urinalysis===
Urine sample or [[urinalysis]] can reveal the presence of [[proteinuria]] (protein in the urine), a possible indicator of infection or kidney disease, or the presence of blood which can indicate a [[urinary tract infection]]. Urinalysis might also show the presence of glucose ([[glycosuria]]), but women of child-bearing age are unlikely to have undiagnosed diabetes (this is separate from [[gestational diabetes]] that may occasionally develop during the course of a subsequent pregnancy).

==Using the assessment==

===Physicians===
When women have pre-existing illnesses / conditions / diseases, these may add to pre-natal risks and will need ongoing evaluation. Also any medications which are used to treat these conditions will need monitored and possibly reduced or increased.

The presence of Diabetes remains a huge risk for the unborn child, and a woman will be screened specifically for this condition. Known diabetics will need monitored closely. For more information, see this online article Diabetes and Diabetic risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=William H. |last=Herman |author2=Denise Charron-Prochownik |date=Summer 2000 |title=Preconception Counseling: An Opportunity Not to Be Missed |journal=Clinical Diabetes |volume=18 |issue=3 |page=122 |url=http://journal.diabetes.org/clinicaldiabetes/V18N32000/pg122.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The woman's role===
A woman may need to adjust certain aspects of her health and well-being which are in her control. These usually include aspects of lifestyle, drug and alcohol use, exercise, rest and stress reduction. In addition, she may need to discontinue certain herbs or over-the-counter medications as recommended by her healthcare provider. Many physicians will also recommend pre-natal vitamins before a woman actually conceives in order to boost her overall health.

'''Probosutedjo''' (1 May 1930 – 26 March 2018) was the younger half-brother of former [[Indonesia]]n president [[Suharto]]. Like many Indonesians, [[Indonesian names|he took only one name]]. Probosutedjo was one of seven children from his mother's second marriage, his father being Atmopawiro and his mother (also Suharto's mother) Sukirah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Soeharto, as related to G. Dwipayana and Ramadhan K.H.|date=1989|title=Soeharto: Pikiran, ucapan dan tindakan saya: otobiografi|trans-title=Soeharto: My thoughts, words and deeds: an autobiography|publisher=PT Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada|place=Jakarta|ISBN=979-8085-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Like Suharto, he was born and raised in the small hamlet of [[Kemusuk]] to the west of the main town of [[Yogyakarta]]. &lt;ref&gt;Brief details are provided in R.E. Elson, 2001, ''Suharto: A political biography'', Cambridge UK, Cambridge University Press, Chapter 1. {{ISBN|0-521-77326-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Suharto was the only child of their mother's first marriage.)&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;McDonald, H., ''Suharto's Indonesia'', page, 10. Fontana Books, 1980, Blackburn, Australia, {{ISBN|0-00-635721-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of his life, Probosutedjo maintained a close relationship with Suharto.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the various references in Elson, ''op. cit''.&lt;/ref&gt; Probosutedjo's business activities flourished under Suharto's [[Orde Baru|New Order]] government. He developed business opportunities in the forestry sector having founded the ''PT Menara Hutan Buana'' company to carry on forestry activities. During the period of the New Order government, he co-founded the Indonesian Indigenous Entrepreneurs Association (HIPPI), a move that reportedly drew the ire of president Suharto.

In the 1980s, he was active in supporting the establishment of the [[Mercu Buana University]] in Indonesia with several campuses in various parts of Jakarta.

During the 1970s, some of Probosutedjo's activities had became the focus of corruption allegations.&lt;ref name="McDonald"/&gt; In 2003, he was tried and convicted for corruption and the loss of $10 million from the Indonesian state. He was sentenced to four years in jail. He later won a reduction of his sentence to two years, initiating a probe by the Indonesian [[Corruption Eradication Commission]] into the alleged scandal of the "judicial mafia" which uncovered offers of $600,000 to various judges. Probosutedjo confessed to the scheme in October 2005, leading to the arrest of his lawyers. His full four-year term was reinstated. After a brief standoff at a hospital, in which he was reportedly protected by a group of police officers, he was arrested on November 30, 2005.

Like other members of the extended Suharto family, he remained a supporter of his brother's activities after Suharto's death in 2008.  He joined with others in recalling personal memories about Suharto in a book, ''Pak Harto: The untold stories'', published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Probosutedjo, 2011, ''Lagi-lagi kena tegur'' [''Scolded again''], in Chapter 5, Mahpudi ''et. al.'' (editors), ''Pak Harto: The untold stories'', Jakarta, PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama.  {{ISBN|978-979-22-7131-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  And in 2013, he supported the publication of a book of anecdotes from palace-based reporters remembering Suharto entitled ''34 Palace Journalists talk about Pak Harto.''

Probosutedjo died on 26 March 2018 at the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Asril|first1=Sabrina|title=Biodata Probosutedjo, Sang Pengusaha Orde Baru|url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2018/03/26/10094201/biodata-probosutedjo-sang-pengusaha-orde-baru|accessdate=26 March 2018|publisher=Kompas.com|date=26 March 2018}} and '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/03/26/soehartos-half-brother-dies-at-87-years-of-age.html Soeharto's half-brother dies at 87 years of age'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 26 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later the same day his body was taken to his home village of Kemusuk near Yogyakarta accompanied by his family and members of the Suharto family including [[Titiek Suharto]] and Mamiek Suharto.  A large crowd of local people from the Kemusuk area attended a ceremony for his burial in the local Soemenggalan cemetery. &lt;ref&gt;Markus Yuwono, '[https://regional.kompas.com/read/2018/03/26/20232241/jenazah-probosutedjo-tiba-di-pemakaman Jenazah Probosutedjo tiba di pemakaman'] ['Probosutedjo's body arrives for burial'], ''Kompas'', 26 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is survived by his wife Ratmani Probosutedjo and six children Diniarti Pertiwi, Septanto, Rita Ria Kurnianta, Rindangsari Kurniawati, Nurani Pujiastuti, and Priasto.

The game has also been ported to Mac OS X by Virtual Programming, Ltd.

==Gameplay==

The player controls the kind of cuisine the restaurant serves ([[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[French cuisine|French]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[German cuisine|German]]). Along with Munich, other cities include [[Los Angeles]], [[Paris]], and [[Rome]].

As a new feature, the player can also own various kinds of restaurants, including a [[coffeehouse|coffee shop]] and a dessert house. In the campaign mode, many new features have been added, such as organizing performance in your restaurant and changing the colors of the uniforms on your staff. Returning characters are Armand and Michel LeBoeuf, Delia Delecoeur, and Don Corleone. The campaign mode features a remade version of the campaign in the original Restaurant Empire. The game also focuses more on the managerial aspects of running a restaurant empire.

==Critical reception==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}

Reviews have been mixed, with praise for adding new content and keeping the game alive, but complaints about micromanagement and the recycled graphics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.ign.com/articles/993/993228p1.html IGN: Restaurant Empire 2 Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Metacritic rates it as "Mixed or average reviews."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/restaurantempire2?q=restaurant%20empire%202 Metacritic: Restaurant Empire 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ron Foxcroft''' (born November 5, 1945) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman and former [[basketball]] [[official (basketball)|referee]]. He is the Chairman, Founder &amp; [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Fox 40|Fox 40 International]], a company best known for manufacturing [[whistle]]s, and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] &amp; Chairman of the Fluke Transportation Group, a transportation, warehousing and distribution specialist.&lt;ref name="About Us - Fox 40 Executives"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us - Fox 40 Executives |url=http://www.fox40world.com/index.cfm?pagepath=ABOUT_US/The_Fox_40_Executives&amp;id=55886|publisher=Fox 40 International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both companies are headquartered in Foxcroft's hometown of [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]].

Foxcroft bought the Fluke Transportation Group and built it from 3 trucks to 176 trucks, 475 trailers and 1.3 million square feet of warehousing. Fluke has the well-known slogan “IF IT’S ON TIME… IT’S A FLUKE.” While working at Fluke, Foxcroft also worked as a [[NCAA]] [[basketball]] [[official (basketball)|referee]]. Foxcroft is Canada’s only [[NCAA]] referee.&lt;ref name="About Us - Fox 40 Executives"/&gt; He has also officiated over 1600 international games in 30 countries.&lt;ref name="About Us - Fox 40 Executives"/&gt;

Foxcroft often became frustrated with the traditional design of referees' [[whistle]]s, which features a "pea" (cork ball) inside that is prone to jamming, thereby preventing the [[whistle]] from producing sound. He  was inspired to create a "pealess" [[whistle]] following incidents in international games including the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]]&lt;ref name="About Us - The Story of Fox 40"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us - The Story of Fox 40 |url=http://www.fox40world.com/index.cfm?pagepath=ABOUT_US/The_Story_of_Fox_40&amp;id=55884|publisher=Fox 40 International}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1984 pre-Olympics game in [[São Paulo]],&lt;ref name=FOXY&gt;{{cite web| title = Famous, Should be Famous and Infamous Canadians: Ron Foxcroft|url=http://www.famouscanadians.net/name/f/foxcroftron.php| accessdate = 2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Foxcroft witnessed an obvious [[Foul (basketball)|foul]] but he could not stop play as his [[whistle]] was rendered useless by a jammed pea; play continued and the referees were [[booing|booed]] by spectators.&lt;ref name=FOXY /&gt; Foxcroft collaborated with an Ontario design consultant, Chuck Shepherd, to design a pealess [[whistle]];&lt;ref name="About Us - The Story of Fox 40"/&gt; they established [[Fox 40|Fox 40 International]] in 1987, and the company's whistles were first used at the [[1987 Pan American Games]] in [[Indianapolis]]. Throughout the 1990s, [[Fox 40]] [[whistle]]s became the standard [[whistle]] for referees and officials in numerous major professional sports leagues including the [[NFL]], [[Canadian Football League|CFL]], [[NHL]], [[NCAA]] and [[NBA]]; it has also been adopted as a standard by numerous public safety agencies around the world.&lt;ref name="About Us - The Story of Fox 40"/&gt; Today, [[Fox 40|Fox 40 International]] dominates the [[whistle]] industry with thousands of [[whistle]]s produced each day in [[Canada]].

Foxcroft has received many awards; he received an Honorary Doctorate from [[McMaster University]], was named Hamilton Distinguished Citizen of the Year, and was inducted into the Hamilton Gallery of Distinction, recipient of the Queen’s Jubilee Medal. He was named by Profit Magazine as one of the 10 top Canadian entrepreneurs of the decade and inducted into the Burlington Entrepreneur Hall of Fame, the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame, and the Hamilton Sports Hall of Fame. Foxcroft is also the [[Honorary Colonel]] of the Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's).

Today, Foxcroft remains CEO of both Fluke Transportation and Fox 40 International Inc. He is also employed by the [[NBA]] to evaluate the performance of their referees.&lt;ref name="About Us - Fox 40 Executives"/&gt; Foxcroft also works as a motivational speaker and supports charitable causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hillfield Strathallen Website|url=http://www.hsc.on.ca|work=Advancement Brochure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Schultz Building''', formerly the '''Atlantic National Bank Annex''', is a historic building in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], United States. It was built between 1925 and 1926 for the [[Atlantic National Bank]] as an [[wikt:annex|annex]] to the [[Atlantic National Bank Building]], located immediately behind it. It stands at 118 West Adams Street, and was added to the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997 as part of the [[Downtown Jacksonville Multiple Property Submission]].

==History==
The [[Atlantic National Bank]], established in 1903, had built the [[Atlantic National Bank Building]] (now 121 Atlantic Center) on 121 West Forsyth Street in 1909.&lt;ref name=ANBB&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wood|first=Wayne |year= 1992 |title= D-58: Atlantic National Bank Building |journal= Jacksonville's Architectural Heritage |volume= |issue= |pages= 61 |publisher= [[University Press of Florida]] |isbn= 0-8130-0953-7 |url= http://www.jaxhistory.com/Jax%20Arch%20Herit/D-58.htm |accessdate= November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1925 the bank had grown such that it required additional space. To accommodate their needs, the bank built the Annex directly behind the headquarters at 118 West Adams Street.&lt;ref name=ANBA&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wood|first=Wayne |year= 1992 |title= D-9: Atlantic National Bank Annex|journal= Jacksonville's Architectural Heritage |volume= |issue= |pages= 61 |publisher= [[University Press of Florida]] |isbn= 0-8130-0953-7 |url= http://www.jaxhistory.com/Jax%20Arch%20Herit/D-9.htm |accessdate= November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Annex was designed by Jacksonville architects [[Marsh and Saxelbye]] and constructed by New York City firm George A. Fuller Co. between 1925 and 1926. Though it had a different architect than the headquarters, its facade is very similar to the older building's, with white [[terra cotta]] and decorative elements such as [[cartouch]]es, a [[balustrade]], and a [[dentil]]ed [[cornice]]. The building stands ten stories high and cost around $400,000 to build.&lt;ref name=ANBA/&gt;

The Atlantic National Bank merged with [[First Union]] in 1985, and both buildings subsequently changed hands. The Annex's lower facade was altered.&lt;ref name=ANBA/&gt; In the 1990s it was recognized as one of Jacksonville's most significant historic buildings, and was included in the [[Downtown Jacksonville Multiple Property Submission]], a [[Multiple Property Submission]] to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. It was added to the National Register on November 7, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/FL/Duval/state.html |title= Florida-Duval County |author= |date= 2011 |work= nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com |publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12204">In [[economics]], a firm will choose to implement a '''shutdown''' of production when the revenue received from the sale of the [[goods and services|goods or services]] produced cannot even cover the [[fixed cost]]s of production. In that situation, the firm will experience a higher loss when it produces, compared to not producing at all. 

Technically, shutdown occurs if [[marginal revenue]] is below [[average variable cost]] at the profit-maximizing positive level of output. Producing anything would not generate revenue significant enough to offset the associated variable costs; producing some output would add losses (additional costs in excess of revenues) to the costs inevitably being incurred (the [[fixed cost]]s). By not producing, the firm loses only the fixed costs.

==Explanation==

The goal of a firm is to maximize profits or minimize losses. The firm can achieve this goal by following two rules. First, the firm should operate, if at all, at the level of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Second, the firm should shut down rather than operate if it can reduce losses by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J. (2009) p.231.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;Lovell (2004) p.243.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The shutdown rule===
Generally, a firm must have revenue &lt;math&gt;R \ge TC&lt;/math&gt;, total costs, in order to avoid losses. However, in the short run, all fixed costs are [[sunk cost]]s. Netting out fixed costs, a firm then faces the requirement that &lt;math&gt;R \ge VC&lt;/math&gt;, variable costs, in order to continue operating. Thus, a firm will find it more profitable to operate so long as the market price ''p ≥ AVC'', average variable cost.&lt;ref&gt;Revenue R = PQ, price times quantity. Average variable cost AVC = VC/Q, variable cost divided by quantity. Thus, ''R ≥ VC'' implies ''p ≥ AVC''.&lt;/ref&gt; Conventionally stated the shutdown rule is: "in the short run a firm should continue to operate if price exceeds average variable costs."&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, W &amp; Marks, S  (2003) p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Restated, the rule is that to produce in the short run a firm must earn sufficient revenue to cover its variable costs.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin &amp; Boyes, (2002) p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the rule is straightforward. By shutting down a firm avoids all variable costs.&lt;ref&gt;Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D:(2001) p.259.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the firm must still pay fixed costs.&lt;ref&gt;Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D: (2001) p.259.&lt;/ref&gt; Because fixed cost must be paid regardless of whether a firm operates they should not be considered in deciding whether to produce or shut down.&lt;ref&gt;This version of the rule implicitly assumes that the firm has incurred sunk costs which are being amortized and treated as fixed costs. Or that fixed costs equal sunk costs. This assumption does not always hold. Sunk costs may have been incurred and paid for, or the cost of fixed inputs may be partially recoverable, through sale and salvage. If all fixed costs are recoverable, then the firm should shut down if price drops below average total costs rather than average variable costs. Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D: (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus in determining whether to shut down a firm should compare total revenue to total variable costs (VC) rather than total costs (FC (fixed costs) + VC). If the revenue the firm is receiving is greater than its variable cost (R &gt; VC) then the firm is covering all variable cost plus there is additional revenue which partially or entirely offsets fixed costs.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, W &amp; Marks, S  (2003) p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; (The size of the fixed costs is irrelevant as it is a [[sunk cost]].&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J. (2009) p.237.&lt;/ref&gt; The same consideration is used whether fixed costs are one dollar or one million dollars.) On the other hand if VC &gt; R then the firm is not even covering its production costs and it should immediately shut down. The rule is conventionally stated in terms of price (average revenue) and average variable costs. The rules are equivalent&amp;mdash;if one divides both sides of inequality TR &gt; VC (total revenue exceeds variable costs) by the output quantity Q one obtains P &gt; AVC (price exceeds average variable cost)). If the firm decides to operate it will produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs because these conditions insure profit maximization (or equivalently, when profit is negative, loss minimization).&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, W &amp; Marks, S (2006) p.286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to state the rule is that a firm should compare the profits from operating to those realized if it shut down, and select the option that produces the greater profit (positive or negative).&lt;ref&gt;Png, I: 1999. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S (2002) p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; A firm that is shut down is generating zero revenue and incurring no variable costs. However the firm still incurs fixed cost.&lt;ref&gt;Bade and Parkin, pp. 353-54.&lt;/ref&gt; So the firm’s profit equals the negative of fixed costs or (- FC).&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S (2002) p.193&lt;/ref&gt; An operating firm is generating revenue, incurring variable costs and paying fixed costs. The operating firm's profit is R - VC - FC . The firm should continue to operate if R - VC - FC ≥ - FC which simplified is R ≥ VC.&lt;ref&gt;Png, I: (1999) p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S (2002) p.194&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between revenue, R, and variable costs, VC, is the contribution toward offsetting fixed costs, and any positive contribution is better than none. Thus, if R ≥ VC then the firm should operate. If R &lt; VC the firm should shut down.

===Sunk costs===

An implicit assumption of the above rules is that all fixed costs are sunk costs. When some costs are sunk and some are not sunk,{{clarification needed|reason=explain how fixed costs can be non-sunk|date=September 2013}} total fixed costs (TFC) equal sunk fixed costs (SFC) plus non-sunk fixed costs (NSFC) or TFC = SFC + NSFC. When some fixed costs are non-sunk, the shutdown rule must be modified. As Besanko notes, to illustrate the new rule it is necessary to define a new cost curve, the average non-sunk cost curve, or ANSC. The ANSC equals the average variable costs plus the average non-sunk fixed cost or ANSC = AVC + ANFC.  The new rule then becomes: if the price is greater than the minimum average costs, produce; if the price is between minimum average costs and minimum ANSC produce, and if the price is less than minimum ANSC for all levels of production, shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Besanko and Braeutigam (2002) p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; If all fixed costs are non-sunk, then (a competitive) firm would shut down if the price were below average total costs.&lt;ref&gt;Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D (2001) p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short-run shutdown compared to long-run exit==

A decision to shut down means that the firm is temporarily suspending production.&lt;ref&gt;Mnakiw, (2007) 296.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not mean that the firm is going out of business (exiting the industry).&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S (2002) p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; If market conditions improve, due to prices increasing or production costs falling, the firm can resume production. Shutting down is a short-run decision.&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S 2002.p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; A firm that has shut down is not producing, but it still retains its capital assets; however, the firm cannot leave the industry or avoid its fixed costs in the short run. 

However, a firm will not choose to incur losses indefinitely. In the long run, the firm will have to decide whether to continue in business or to leave the industry and pursue profits elsewhere. Exit is a long-term decision. A firm that has exited an industry has avoided all commitments and freed all capital for use in more profitable enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; A firm that exits an industry earns no revenue but it incurs no costs, fixed or variable.&lt;ref&gt;Mankiw, N Principles of Microeconomics 4th ed. (Thomson 2007) p 298.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The long-run decision is based on the relationship of the price P and long-run average costs LRAC.&lt;ref&gt;In the long run there is no distinction between average variable costs and average costs because all costs are variable. Landsburg, S (2002) p.167&lt;/ref&gt; If P ≥ LRAC then the firm will not exit the industry. If P &lt; LRAC, then the firm will exit the industry. These comparisons will be made after the firm has made the necessary and feasible long-term adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;As Boyes notes the long run options of a firm are not limited to exiting or remaining in the industry - the  firm can " expand, contract, relocate, enter a new business, exit any line of business or quit doing business altogether."Boyes, W. (2004) p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the long run a firm operates where marginal revenue equals long-run marginal costs, but only if it decides to remain in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J:2008 page 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the firm's long-run supply curve is the long run marginal cost curve above the minimum point of the long run average cost curve.&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S (2002) p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monopolist Shutdown Rule==

A monopolist should shut down when price (average revenue) is less than average variable cost for every output level;&lt;ref&gt;Frank, R., (2008) Mc-Graw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, it should shut down if the demand curve is entirely below the average variable cost curve.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, R., (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Under these circumstances, even at the profit-maximizing level of output (where MR = MC, marginal revenue equals marginal cost) average revenue would be lower than average variable costs and the monopolist would be better off shutting down in the short run.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, R., (2008) (Mc-Graw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculating the shutdown point==

The short run shutdown point for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average variable cost curve. Assume that a firm's total cost function is TC = Q&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; -5Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +60Q +125. Then its variable cost function is
Q&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; -5Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +60Q, and its 
average variable cost function is (Q&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; -5Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +60Q)/Q= Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; -5Q + 60. The slope of the average variable cost curve is the derivative of the latter, namely 2Q - 5. Equating this to zero to find the minimum gives Q = 2.5, at which level of output average variable cost is 53.75. Thus if the market price of the product drops below 53.75, the firm will choose to shut down production.

The long run shutdown point for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average total cost curve. Assume that a firm's total cost function is the same as above example. To find the shut down point in the long run, first take the derivative of ATC and then set it to zero and solve for Q. After getting Q plug it into the MC to get the price.

'''Social BPM''' is a discipline which combines traditional [[Business Process Management]] techniques with [[Web 2.0]] "social" tools and technologies, to facilitate business improvement efforts.&lt;ref&gt;http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/social-BPM-business-process-management&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate about whether Social BPM is a methodology, a set of technologies, or just a buzzword.  Forrester Research's Clay Richardson defines Social BPM to include:
* A methodology
* Social Networking principles
* A combination of Web 2.0 and social tools with BPM to enable bi-directional collaboration

'''Social innovations''' are new [[strategies]], [[concept]]s, [[idea]]s and organizations that aim to meet [[social]] needs resulting from [[working condition]]s, [[education]], [[community development]], and [[health]]. These ideas are created with the goal of extending and strengthening [[civil society]]. Social innovation includes the social ''processes'' of innovation, such as open source methods and techniques and also the [[innovation]]s which have a [[social purpose]]—like [[activism]], [[online volunteering]], [[microcredit]], or [[Distance education|distance learning]].

Prominent innovators associated with the term include Pakistani [[Akhter Hameed Khan]], Bangladeshi [[Muhammad Yunus (economist)|Muhammad Yunus]], the founder of [[Grameen Bank]] which pioneered the concept of [[microcredit]] for supporting innovations in many developing countries such as Asia, Africa and Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Domanski, Monge, Quitiaquez, Rocha|title=Innovación Social en Latinoamérica|date=2016|publisher=Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios|isbn=978-958-763-196-8|url=http://sfs.tu-dortmund.de/Publikationen/Innovacion_Social_en_Latinoamerica.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired programs like the [[Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foreign |first=Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2226809/Info-Ladies-bringing-internet-bike-remote-villages-Bangladesh.html |title=Info Ladies bringing the internet by bike to the remote villages of Bangladesh &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-11-02 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asafeworldforwomen.org/global-news/asia/bangladesh/3284-internet-info-ladies.html |title=Internet rolls into Bangladesh villages on a bike |publisher=Asafeworldforwomen.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh |title=Info Ladies – Riding Internet into Rural Bangladesh! |publisher=Amader Kotha |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2014-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317182454/http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh/ |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Dnet (A Social Enterprise)]]. 

==Focus and application==
Social Innovation has an inter-sectoral approach and is universally applicable. Social Innovations are launched by a variety of actors, including research institutions, companies and independent organizations, which tend to use their respective definitions of Social Innovation. Therefore, it is worth discussing what distinguishes it from other forms of social work or [[innovation]]. 

Social Innovation focuses on the process of innovation, how innovation and change take shape (as opposed to the more traditional definition of innovation, giving priority to the internal organization of firms and their productivity). It likewise centers on new work and new forms of cooperation (business models),&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;Klievink, B., &amp; Janssen, M. (2014). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10580530.2014.923268 "Developing multi-layer information infrastructures: advancing social innovation through public-private governance"]  "Information Systems Management" 31:240–249&lt;/ref&gt; especially on those that work towards the attainment of a sustainable society.

The Young Foundation, in order to distinguish between social and business innovation, stressed that social innovation is developed and diffused via organisations, whose primary purposes are not centred on mere profit maximisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Innovation. What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated|last=Mulgan|first=Tucker|publisher=The Young Foundation|year=2007|isbn=|location=London|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of European Policy Advisers more precisely defined social innovation as socially oriented in both ends and means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=). Empowering People, Driving Change: Social Innovation in the European Union|last=Hubert|first=A,|publisher=BEPA – Bureau of European Policy Advisers|year=2010|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these influential definitions, social innovation is characterised by: the capacity to address social needs that traditional policy seems increasingly unable to tackle; the empowerment of groups and individuals; and the willingness to change social relations. Hence, social innovation is often presented as a way to increase the quality of social services and their cost-effectiveness, offering equivalent, if not superior, outcomes despite considerable budget constraints.

Social innovation can take place within [[government]]; the for-profit sector, the [[nonprofit]] sector (also known as the third sector), or in the spaces between them. Research has focused on the types of platforms needed to facilitate such cross-sector collaborative social innovation.

[[Social entrepreneurship]], like social enterprise, is typically in the nonprofit sector excluding both for-profit and public organizations. Both social entrepreneurship and social enterprise are important contributions to social innovation by creating social value and introducing new ways of achieving goals. Social entrepreneurship brings "new patterns and possibilities for innovation" and are willing to do things that existing organizations are not willing to do.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"&gt;James A. Phills Jr., Kriss Deiglmeier, &amp; Dale T. Miller "Rediscovering Social Innovation", Stanford Social Innovation Review Fall 2008.[http://innovationsociale.lu/sites/default/files/2008_Rediscovering%20Social%20Innovation_Phills%26al.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social innovation is often an effort of mental [[creativity]] which involves fluency and flexibility from a wide range of disciplines. The act of social innovation in a sector is mostly connected with diverse disciplines within the society. The social innovation theory of 'connected difference' emphasizes three key dimensions to social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan. Geoff. [http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/research/Pages/socialinnovationpaper.aspx "Social Innovation: What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated: Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, University of Oxford"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902021840/http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/research/Pages/socialinnovationpaper.aspx |date=2012-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, innovations are usually new combinations or hybrids of existing elements, rather than completely new. Second, their practice involves cutting across organizational or disciplinary boundaries. Lastly, they leave behind compelling new relationships between previously separate individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;Nambisan, S. [http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/platforms_for_collaboration "Platforms for Collaboration"], Stanford Social Innovation Review, Summer 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Social innovation is also gaining visibility within academia.&lt;ref&gt;Howaldt, J./ Schwarz, M.

Since 2014, a subdomain of social innovation has been defined in relation to the introduction of digital technologies. The subdomain is called digital social innovation and refers to "a type of social and collaborative innovation in which innovators, users and communities collaborate using digital technologies to co-create knowledge and solutions for a wide range of social needs and at a scale and speed that was unimaginable before the rise of the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;F. Bria, DSI4EU final report, 2015, available at: http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/dsireport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Social innovation was discussed in the writings of figures such as [[Peter Drucker]] and [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] (founder of the [[Open University]] and dozens of other organizations) in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;see for example Gavron, Dench e ds ''Young at 80'', Carcanet Press, London, 1995 for a comprehensive overview of one of the world's most successful social innovators&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in the work of French writers in the 1970s, such as [[Pierre Rosanvallon]], [[Jacques Fournier]], and [[Jacques Attali]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambon, J.-L, David, A. and Devevey, J.-M (1982), Les Innovations Sociales, Presses Universitaires de France, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; However, the themes and concepts in social innovation existed long before. [[Benjamin Franklin]], for example, talked about small modifications within the social organization of communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15326934CRJ1402_11 |title=Mumford, M.D. (2002) Social Innovation: Ten Cases from Benjamin Franklin, '&amp;#39;Creativity Research Journal'&amp;#39;, 14(2), 253-266 |publisher=Leaonline.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that could help to solve everyday problems. Many radical 19th century [[reform]]ers like [[Robert Owen]], founder of the cooperative movement, promoted innovation in the social field and all of the great sociologists including [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] focused attention on broader processes of [[social change]].  Other theories of innovation became prominent in the 20th century, many of which had social implications, without putting social progress at the center of the theory. [[Joseph Schumpeter]], for example, addressed the process of [[innovation]] directly with his theory of [[creative destruction]] and his definition of entrepreneurs as people who combined existing elements in new ways to create a new product or service. Beginning in the 1980s, writers on technological change increasingly addressed how social factors affect technology diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;notably in the writings of [[Christopher Freeman]], Carlotta Perez, Ian Miles and others&lt;/ref&gt;

The article "Rediscovering Social Innovation" mentions how social innovations are dependent on history and the change in institutions. The article discusses the ten recent social innovations reflecting current change to include:
* '''Charter Schools:''' Charter schools are a social innovation that provides an alternative avenue for students to continue to develop and build upon their educational foundation without many of the issues prominent in the public school system. These primary and secondary schools are publicly funded and operate independently, which allows the teachers and parents to collaboratively develop alternative teaching methods for their students as related regulations are less stringent for Charter Schools.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Charter School." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, n.d. Web. Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Community-Centered Planning:''' This social innovation allows communities to plan and develop systems that cater solutions to their specific local needs by using their historical knowledge and other local resources.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Emissions Trading:''' The Emissions Trading program was designed to address issues associated with the continuous increase in pollution. The program provides solutions such as setting a cap on the amount that certain pollutants can be emitted, and implementing a permit system to control the amount of pollution produced by each participating business. If a business needs to use more pollution than permitted, it can purchase credits from a business that has not emitted its maximum permitted amount. The goal of the Emissions Trading program is that, over time and with increased awareness, society will limit the types and the numbers of pollutants emitted to what is only necessary.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Fair Trade:''' Products including coffee, sugar, and chocolate are currently being traded without high standards that result in tough conditions for farmers and a less sustainable environment. Fair trade is a movement that certifies traders to exchange with the farmers that produce these products. The idea behind this movement is that by being paid a living-wage, being able to meet social and environmental standards and promoting "environmental sustainability, the lives of these farmers will be improved.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Habitat Conservation Plans:''' Habitat Conservation Plans is an effort by the US Fish and Wild Life Service and the Environmental Protection Agency to protect species and their endangerment by providing economical incentives to conserve their habitats and protect these species from endangerment.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Individual Development Accounts:''' This social innovation is made to support the working poor with saving decisions that they have made to better enhance their lives. This initiative will give $2 per every $1 saved by the working poor for College tuition, purchasing a home, starting a business, and other similar and productive initiatives. This is made possible by philanthropic, government and corporate sponsors that donate to this cause.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''International Labor Standards:''' Labor standards differ country-to-country, with some agreeably better than others. In effort to internationally align these, the International Labor Organization, participating governments, and employees contributed to the development of standards that protect workers’ rights to freedom, equity, security, and human dignity".&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Microfinance:''' This social innovation is created to support those financially unable to gain access to financial services such as banking, lending, and insurance. The ultimate goal of Microfinance is to enable an escape from poverty by helping to improve the living conditions and financial viability among the impoverished program participants.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Socially Responsible Investing:''' "An investment strategy that attempts to maximize both financial and social returns. Investors generally favor businesses and other organizations whose practices support environmental sustainability, human rights, and consumer protection."&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Supported Employment:''' Supported Employment is a social innovation geared towards helping disabled or disadvantaged workers who are un- or under-employed due to their condition obtain suitable employment. The Support Employment service provides access to job coaches, transportation, assistive technology, specialized job training, and individual tailored supervision in effort to help program participants become more competitive applicants and better prepared overall for the job market.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Over the last two decades social innovation has gained significant popularity as a strategy to tackle new social risks including population ageing and its health correlates (Hubert, 2010; Mulgan et al., 2007, 2010; Murray, Caulier-Grice and Mulgan, 2010). However, as other concepts recently developed within the academic debate – among them, [[social capital]] (Ferragina, 2012) – social innovation might soon turn out to be simply another way to juxtapose the qualifier "social" to the private sector jargon, in order to avoid heated discussions on structural inequalities (Grisolia and Ferragina, 2015).&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"&gt;Grisolia, Francesco and Ferragina, Emanuele. (2015), "Social Innovation on the Rise: yet another buzzword in a time of austerity?" (Salute e società, Vol. 1(2015), pp. 169-179).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of ‘neoliberal austerity’, a strong call in favour of social innovation might hide the attempt to shift public attention from structural deficiencies and disparities to individual and group responsibility, following the vision: "doing more with less". In order to guarantee universal coverage and universal social rights, however, the welfare state system cannot be managed with the logic of mere cost-effectiveness alone (Grisolia and Ferragina, 2015).&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"/&gt; A Universal coverage is the precondition for any well-functioning economy, not the other way around. As such, the enhancement of "politically motivated policies under the pretence of budget cuts" can be particularly dangerous in its consequences for population health (Kleinert and Horton, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;1074). Social innovation per se might not be able to substantially tackle pressing social needs. Rather, the all-innovating and self-empowering jargon currently in vogue might disguise a dangerous inattention to structural inequalities, adversely affecting health outcomes across the board, but especially of the poorest. Among the therapies prescribed by the neoliberal orthodoxy – liberalisation, deregulation, devolution, individual or group empowerment – social innovation might soon reveal itself as a convenient buzzword, an eclectic concept to dissimulate political choices, legitimated by the doctrine of budgetary constraints.&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"/&gt; The redistribution of resources "from past to present generations" – keeping constant the overall public spending – and the shift from a "transfer-based" to a "service-based" welfare state would represent a truly innovative approach to social policy, offering a credible and responsible alternative to the magic wand of social innovation.

== Developments since 2000 ==
Academic research, [[blogs]] and websites feature social innovation, along with organizations working on the boundaries of research and practical action. Topics include:

* '''Innovation in public services''' was pioneered particularly in some [[Scandinavia]]n and [[List of Asian countries|Asian countries]]. Governments are increasingly recognizing that innovation requires [[healthcare]], schooling and [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/innovation/index.asp Innovation in the Public Sector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110162352/http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/innovation/index.asp |date=2006-11-10 }} an overview of thinking about innovation in the public sector, published by the UK government's Strategy Unit in 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/node/576 Ready or Not?] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070618163301/http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/node/576 |date=2007-06-18 }} published by The Young Foundation in 2007 about the need for public sector organizations to innovate&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional support===
The US created an Office for Social Innovation in the White House, which is funding projects that combine public and private resources.&lt;ref name=economist810/&gt; with foundations that support social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Kohli, J. and Geoff Mulgan (2007) [http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/capital-ideas-july-2010 Capital Ideas. How to Generate Innovation in the Public Sector]. The Young Foundation and Center for American Progress&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the US government listed 11 investments made by its '[[Social Innovation Fund]]', with public funding more than matched by philanthropic organizations. This fund focuses on partnerships with charities, social enterprises, and business.&lt;ref name="economist810"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, educational institutions are now increasingly supporting teaching and research in the area of social innovation. In addition to pioneered efforts by institutions such as the Harvard Business School's Initiative on Social Enterprise (launched 1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/socialenterprise/ |title=The Social Enterprise Initiative at Harvard Business School |publisher=Hbs.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Said Business School's Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship (launched 2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/ideas-impact/skoll |title=The Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, Said Business School, University of Oxford |publisher=Sbs.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  INSEAD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/centres/social_entrepreneurship/ |title=INSEAD Social Entrepreneurship Programme |publisher=Insead.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other universities now offer short-term programs in Social Innovation, and a few such as [https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/professional-practice/mst-social-innovation/ Cambridge Judge Business School], University of Cambridge and Goldsmiths, University of London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-social-entrepreneurship/ |title=The Goldsmiths MA Programme in Social Entrepreneurship, University of London |publisher=Gold.ac.uk |date=2014-04-16 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer Masters courses dedicated entirely to the study of theory and practice in relation to social entrepreneurship and innovation.

Public policy makers support social innovation in the UK, Australia, China and Denmark, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan, Ali, Tucker; ''Social innovation: what it is, why it matters, how it can be accelerated, published by Said Business School, Oxford, 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union’s innovation strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/index_en.cfm |title=Home page - Innovation Union - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2014-05-13 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first well-funded research and development strategy to emphasize social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, R., Caulier- Grice and Geoff Mulgan (2010) [http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/the-open-book-social-innovation-march-2010 The Open Book of Social Innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008044055/http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/the-open-book-social-innovation-march-2010 |date=2010-10-08 }}. The Young Foundation and NESTA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the South Australian government, led by Premier and Social Inclusion Minister Mike Rann, embraced a ten-year social innovation strategy with big investments and a focus on reform in areas such as homelessness, school retention, mental health and disability services.

The Common Ground&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commonground.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; and Street to Home homelessness initiatives and the Australian Centre for Social Innovation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tacsi.org,au&lt;/ref&gt; were established in Adelaide and many reforms trialed in South Australia have been adopted nationally throughout Australia. This initiative, headed by Monsignor David Cappo, South Australia's Social Inclusion Commissioner, was advised by 'Thinkers in Residence' [[Geoff Mulgan]] and New York social entrepreneur [[Rosanne Haggerty]].

== Role in curbing corruption ==
Lin and Chen, in "The Impact of Societal and Social innovation: a case-based approach" have argued that social innovation's goal is to produce actions that are "socially valuable and good for many".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956953682|title=The impact of societal and social innovation : a case-based approach|last=Yeh-Yun,|first=Lin, Carol|others=Chen, Jeffrey,|isbn=9789811017667|location=Singapore|oclc=956953682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In governance, its main role is to enhance and maximize the trust of citizens through active involvement in society, whether in the public or private sphere.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Social innovation's role in curbing corruption is carried out through two main mediums. Firstly, it is institutionalized through actors (in the public and the private sectors), and secondly, it is executed with new tools available, specifically ICTs.

=== Public participation, governmental action and the private sector against corruption ===

==== Grassroots involvement ====
"Corruption cannot be tackled from the top, it has to be confronted from the grassroots"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/06/corruption-confronted-grassroots-john-githongo-kenya|title='Corruption has to be confronted from the grassroots' {{!}} Madeleine Bunting|last=Bunting|first=Madeleine|date=2011-05-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[John Githongo]], a Kenyan member of [[Transparency International]]. The Stanford Social Innovation Review develops that grassroots innovations emerge through a combination of social and ethical capital. That is especially true when the system in which they lie fails to accommodate to people's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/tapping_the_entrepreneurial_potential_of_grassroots_innovation|title=Tapping the Entrepreneurial Potential of Grassroots Innovation (SSIR)|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fight against corruption, individuals or groups of citizens have used their position to lead battles against corruption. An example is the case of RosPil.net, a [[crowdsourcing]] website relying on anonymous tips and alerts to uncover and expose corruption in Russia,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carnegie.ru/2010/12/08/navalny-effect-rospil.net-pub-42105|title=The Navalny Effect: RosPil.net|last=Petrov|first=Nikolay|work=Carnegie Moscow Center|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether in the private or the public sector. The collective action permits a growing flow of information and offers, on a daily basis, around three promising tip-offs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another example is the initiative Agenda Pública, a Civil Society [[Civil society organisation|Organisation]], which is paving way for transparent governance in Brazil by relying on the education of the country's public administrators,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/06/where-inequality-persists-social-entrepreneurs-can-step-in-to-bridge-the-gap/|title=Where inequality persists, social entrepreneurs can step in to bridge the gap|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in more remote and isolated rural areas. Agenda Pública trained more than 5,000 administrators in policy development and basic infrastructure, in order to promote effective parameters for transparency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They do so by making sure that environmental needs and basic financial, education and overall health are met to circumvent bribing.

===== Women and corruption =====
A [[UNDP]] study conducted amongst women grassroots organization around the world demonstrated that "79% of women are better able to stand up against corruption if affiliated with a community group".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/Democratic%20Governance/Anti-corruption/Grassroots%20women%20and%20anti-corruption.pdf|title=Grassroots, Women and Anti-Corruption|last=UNDP|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll suggested that electing women into power in countries heavily affected by corruption should be strongly accompanied by an affiliation to a mobilized grassroots women's group. Moreover, 83% of female respondents gave preferences to organized women's leadership to pursue anti-corruption policies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Innovation lies mainly in the introduction of programmes facilitating access to information as well as a governance agenda designed to augment women's engagement in [[participatory monitoring]].

==== Private sector ====
Rich and Moberg in "Beyond Governments" claim that companies need to take the largest step against corruption and must engage in collective governance in order to include public policy and standards in their core business. It would be way to promote good practices, specifically socially responsible investing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781351286077|title=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|website=www.taylorfrancis.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 2006, the corporate sector fully funded and instigated the creation and development of the Business Code of Conduct for Combating Corruption in Malawi. It is considered an anti-corruption task force which works hand in hand with local groups, members of governments, civil society and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-2010/african-business-ending-corruption-%E2%80%98priority-number-one%E2%80%99|title=For African business, ending corruption is ‘priority number one’ {{!}} Africa Renewal Online|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Governmental action ====
Anderson, Wu and Cho argue that good governance and its benefits can be extrapolated through effective e-governance. The simplification of administrative task and open data transparency, coupled with a clear policy on corruption can have a substantial impact.They also advocate for the strengthening of the delivery of services by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934513454|title=E-government strategy, ICT and innovation for citizen engagement|others=Anderson, Dennis (College teacher),, Wu, Robert (College teacher),, Cho, June-Suh, 1966-, Schroeder, Katja (Social media strategist),|isbn=9781493933501|location=New York, NY|oclc=934513454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the government introduced in 2016 the Open Government National Action Plan with one of the main aim being improved transparency. One of the main commitments is the establishment of an Anti-Corruption Innovation Hub. It is the use of social innovation to mobilize social actors and entrepreneurs against corruption. It is perceived that it will "catalyze and connect [an] innovation approach" while promoting the sharing of good practices.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-open-government-national-action-plan-2016-18/uk-open-government-national-action-plan-2016-18#commitment-4-anti-corruption-innovation-hub|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their plan of action has been supported by Switzerland, Indonesia, Spain, Georgia, Australia, the UAE, France and Norway.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In Kosovo, Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts in Kosovo (SAEK) has been developed in order to strengthen the capacities of the Kosovo Anti-Corruption Agency (KAA). They are using innovative [[Information and communications technology|ICT]], web2.0 and social media technologies as a way to connect the government and younger generations by utilizing the potential of new technologies as well as "giving citizens the opportunity to voice concerns, share observations online and to make these visible to the public while raising the awareness  on the level and form of corruption occurring in Kosovo".&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undp.akvoapp.org/en/project/936/|title=Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts in Kosovo|last=UNDP|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAEK is considered a success as in the year it was launched, more than 1024 cases of corruption were reported (with half of them now resolved).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Information and communications technology as a tool for transparency ===
According to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development (part of the [[United Nations]]): "in addition to being an important technology sector in its own right, information and communication technology (ICT) is important for linking agents in the innovation system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developmentfinance.un.org/promoting-information-and-communication-technology-access-to-technology-for-all-and-social-innovation|title=Promoting information and communication technology, access to technology for all and social innovation {{!}} Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development|website=developmentfinance.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Open data and data mining ====
Open data is currently arising as a corruption-fighting mechanism. Indeed, as transparency in government data increases and becomes accessible to all, there will be opportunities for better accountability as it will increase the odds of uncovering governmental misconduct (specifically in government activities, budgets and expenditures for citizens). Its applications are various, including but not restricted to: following the money, open contracting, changing incentives and enabling cross-sector collaboration.

In 2015, one of the [[G20]] priorities was to reduce corruption and to promote good governance.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2015/G20-Anti-Corruption-Open-Data-Principles.pdf|title=G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles|last=G20|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Corruption Working Group (ACWG) developed the Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles in order to leverage open data as one of the key actions to create and foster accountability and transparency. The principles are directly derived from the International Open Data Charter, which specifies the release and use of government data to reduce the reach of corruption.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Transparency International]] and the Web Foundation carried out a study on certain member countries of the G20 (Brazil, France, Germany, Indonesia and South Africa) to evaluate the effect of the principles on their fight against corruption.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/open_data_and_the_fight_against_corruption_in_indonesia|title=TI Publication - Open data and the fight against corruption in Indonesia|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, for example ([[Corruption in Indonesia]]), it is estimated that corruption has cost up to IDR 31,077 trillion to the country.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Through public information availability, the country has tried to foster and promote its anti-corruption actions by utilizing its legal and institutional frameworks. Nonetheless, the access to datasets remains scarce while the lack of education amongst staff and citizens impedes the use of data as a tool against corruption.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Data mining]] was a crucial tool used in the famous anti-corruption investigation of the [[Panama Papers]] by way of the initiative of the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/|title=The Panama Papers: Exposing the Rogue Offshore Finance Industry - ICIJ|work=ICIJ|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of data reached was 2.6 terabytes or 11.5 billion documents.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The implementation of a [[graph database]] allowed for better efficiency in the research and analysis of the documents as it found hidden links between accounts and owners that would have been hard to dig up otherwise. Mar Cabra, ICIJ Data Editor, claimed that the software used made them feel like: "we [had] superpowers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Neo4j|title=How the ICIJ Used Neo4j to Unravel the Panama Papers|date=2016-05-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAlu3ud2k_A|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social media ====
[[Social media]] is amongst the newest factors that has been shown by researchers to reduce the impact of corruption.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968551831|title=Political scandal, corruption, and legitimacy in the age of social media|others=Çakır-Demirhan, Derya,, Demirhan, Kamil,|isbn=9781522520191|location=Hershey, Pennsylvania|oclc=968551831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media platforms have created a multi-way communication which contradicts the one-way channel of traditional media. It enables individuals to share experiences in a quick and cheap manner through its platforms. It facilitates exchanges of geographically separated individuals which makes it an important tool as a dialogue platform.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In many countries, cases of human rights violations and corruption have started to come out publicly. They challenge the status quo of the government holding the monopoly over information.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The World Economic Forum established in 2014 that social media could be a useful tool to drive anti-corruption because of its ability to advance commentary and information provision to the population.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/12/how-to-use-social-media-to-fight-corruption/|title=How to use social media to fight corruption|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also useful because of its key role in investigating through collective action participation. They use the example of I Paid A Bribe, an Indian website inviting users to input their daily contact with corruption and whether they paid a bribe or not to a public servant.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mobile banking ====
[[Petty corruption]] can be fought by the emergence of cashless payments, and more generally in a cashless economy.

In Kenya, [[M-Pesa]] was launched to allow people to transfer money through mobile phones.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/21/africa/mpesa-10th-anniversary/index.html|title=M-Pesa: Kenya's mobile success story turns 10|last=CNN|first=Kieron Monks,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by almost two-thirds of the population and is gaining momentum as it is opening its technology to other countries (Tanzania for example).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

As traffic police is seen as one of the most notorious sources of corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000189201/i-saw-traffic-officers-extort-bribes-president-tells-top-police-bosses|title=I saw traffic officers extort bribes, President tells top police bosses|last=Reporter|first=Standard|work=The Standard|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; M-Pesa proposed to create cashless payments on public buses to avoid the extortion of bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28106004|title=Kenya's buses to go cashless|date=2014-07-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are currently some logistical and regulatory problems preventing it from getting traction, [[mobile banking]] is seen as a potential tool to fight petty corruption, specifically if it is accompanied by the proper framework for legislative action and [[good governance]].
==Local and regional development==
Literature on social innovation in relation to territorial/[[Regional development|regional]] development covers innovation in the [[social economy]], i.e. strategies for satisfaction of human needs; and innovation in the sense of transforming and/or sustaining [[social relations]], especially [[governance]] relations at the regional and local level. Beginning in the late 1980s, Jean-Louis Laville and [[Frank Moulaert]] researched social innovation.&lt;ref name="Laville, J 1994"&gt;Laville, J.-L. (Ed.) (1994) L’économie solidaire, une perspective internationale, Desclée de Brouwer, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylorandfrancis.metapress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;eissn=1360-0591&amp;volume=37&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=289 |title=Moulaert, F. and Sekia, F.

Another, larger project was SINGOCOM&lt;ref name="users.skynet.be"&gt;[http://users.skynet.be/bk368453/singocom/index2.html Social Innovation, Governance, and Community Building] (2002–2004)&lt;/ref&gt; a [[European Commission]] [[FP5|Framework 5]] project, which pioneered so-called "Alternative Models for Local Innovation" (ALMOLIN). These models were further elaborated through community actions covered by KATARSIS&lt;ref name="KATARSIS Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katarsis.ncl.ac.uk/ |title=KATARSIS Homepage |publisher=Katarsis.ncl.ac.uk |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SOCIAL POLIS.&lt;ref name="Social Polis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialpolis.eu/ |title=Social Polis |publisher=Socialpolis.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent works focus on the societal role of the economic life in terms of innovations in social practices and social relations at the local and regional levels. Social Innovation, therefore, is increasingly seen as a process and a strategy to foster human development through solidarity, cooperation, and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="MacCallum, D. 2009"&gt;MacCallum, D., Moulaert, F., Hillier, J. and S. Vicari (Eds) (2009) ''Social Innovation and Territorial Development''. Ashgate, Aldershot. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-7233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masselin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masselin |first=Matthieu |url=http://www.paristechreview.com/2011/12/16/social-innovation-future-economy/ |title='&amp;#39;Is Social Innovation the Future of Economy?'&amp;#39;, ParisTech Review, Dec. 2011 |publisher=Paristechreview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU funded URBACT programme is designed to help cities to exchange and learn around urban policies.  The URBACT methodology can be seen as a social innovation action planning approach. A typical URBACT network would have ten cities working on a specific theme such as active inclusion or regenerating disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  They examine good practice and then working through a local support group use the results to inform their local action plan.&lt;ref&gt;Jegou F., Bonneau M., (2015) [http://urbact.eu/sites/default/files/03_socialinn-web.pdf Social Innovation in Cities - Urbact II Capitalisation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Innovation Europe&lt;ref name="Socialinnovationeurope.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialinnovationeurope.eu |title=Home &amp;#124; Social Innovation Europe |publisher=Socialinnovationeurope.eu |date=2014-05-15 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiative, funded by the European Commission's Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry, was set up to map social innovation at a European level, by creating a directory of grass-roots examples of social innovation from across the 27 member states.

The European Commission funded the SELUSI study between 2008 - 2013 that looked at over 550 social ventures and examined how these insights can spark change and innovation at a much larger scale. It looked at business models of social ventures in five countries - UK being one of them – identifying which specific practices evolved by social ventures are particularly successful, and how and by whom – be it social enterprise, public sector body or mainstream business – they can be most effectively scaled-up.

The European Commission has launched a new initiative (project) in 2013 under FP7 funding, with the aim to build a network of incubators for social innovation across regions and countries. This network facilitates identification of 300 social innovation examples and facilitates its scaling. The network is organised in a way to identify new models for scaling of social innovations across various geographical clusters in collaboration with each other, communicating the ideas, finding the tools and funds, developing business plans and models in order to promote the new promising ideas throughout Europe.
