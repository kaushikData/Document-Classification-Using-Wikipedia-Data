[[File:1850 acrostic Dearborn.png|thumb|upright=1.3|An 1850 acrostic by [[Nathaniel Dearborn]], the first letter of each line spelling the name "[[Jenny Lind|JENNY LIND]]"]]
An '''acrostic''' is a [[poetry|poem]] (or other form of writing) in which the first letter (or syllable, or word) of each line (or [[paragraph]], or other recurring feature in the text) spells out a word, message or the alphabet.&lt;ref name=acrostic&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://outstandingwriting.com/acrostic-the-many-pleasures-of-acrostic-poetry/
|title= Acrostic Poetry
|publisher=OutstandingWriting.com
|accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the French ''acrostiche'' from post-classical [[Latin]] ''acrostichis'', from [[Koine Greek]] ἀκροστιχίς, from [[Ancient Greek]] ἄκρος "highest, topmost" and στίχος "verse").&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd ed., s.v. ''acrostic''; "The expected spelling of the English word, on the n., ''monostich'' n."&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of [[constrained writing]], an acrostic can be used as a [[mnemonic]] device to aid memory retrieval.

Relatively simple acrostics may merely spell out the letters of the alphabet in order; such an acrostic may be called an 'alphabetical acrostic' or [[Abecedarius]]. These acrostics occur in the first four of the five chapters that make up the [[Book of Lamentations]], in the praise of the good wife in [[Proverbs 31]], 10-31, and in [[Psalm]]s [[Psalm 25|25]], [[Psalm 34|34]], [[Psalm 37|37]], [[Psalm 111|111]], [[Psalm 112|112]], [[Psalm 119|119]] and [[Psalm 145|145]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name=biblicalhebrew&gt;{{cite web

|title= Acrostic Psalms
|publisher=Biblicalhebrew.com
|accessdate=2008-09-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080917055036/http://www.biblicalhebrew.com/alphabet.htm| archivedate= 17 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Notable among the acrostic Psalms is the long Psalm 119, which typically is printed in subsections named after the 22 letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]], each section consisting of 8 verses, each of which begins with the same letter of the alphabet and the entire psalm consisting of 22 x 8 = 176 verses; and [[Ashrei|Psalm 145]], which is recited three times a day in the [[Jewish services]]. Some acrostic psalms are technically imperfect. E.g. Psalm 9 and Psalm 10 appear to constitute a single acrostic psalm together, but the length assigned to each letter is unequal and five of the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet are not represented and the sequence of two letters is reversed. In Psalm 25 one Hebrew letter is not represented, the following letter (Resh) repeated. In Psalm 34 the current final verse, 23, does fit verse 22 in content, but adds an additional line to the poem. In Psalms 37 and 111 the numbering of verses and the division into lines are interfering with each other; as a result in Psalm 37, for the letters Daleth and Kaph there is only one verse, and the letter Ayin is not represented. Psalm 111 and 112 have 22 lines, but 10 verses. Psalm 145 does not represent the letter Nun, having 21 one verses, but one Qumran manuscript of this Psalm does have that missing line, which agrees with the Septuagint.

Acrostics are common in medieval literature, where they usually serve to highlight the name of the poet or his patron, or to make a prayer to a saint. They are most frequent in verse works but can also appear in prose. The Middle High German poet [[Rudolf von Ems]] for example opens all his great works with an acrostic of his name, and his world chronicle marks the beginning of each age with an acrostic of the key figure (Moses, David, etc.). In chronicles, acrostics are common in German and English but rare in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{emc1|Graeme Dunphy|Acrostics|8-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the ease of detectability of an acrostic can depend on the intention of its creator. In some cases an author may desire an acrostic to have a better chance of being perceived by an observant reader, such as the acrostic contained in the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' (where the key capital letters are decorated with ornate embellishments). However, acrostics may also be used as a form of [[steganography]], where the author seeks to conceal the message rather than proclaim it. This might be achieved by making the key letters uniform in appearance with the surrounding text, or by aligning the words in such a way that the relationship between the key letters is less obvious. This is referred to as ''[[null cipher]]s'' in steganography, using the first letter of each word to form a hidden message in an otherwise innocuous text.&lt;ref name=Garykessler&gt;{{cite web

==Examples==
A famous acrostic was made in Greek for the acclamation ''JESUS CHRIST, SON OF GOD, SAVIOUR''. The initials spell ΙΧΘΥΣ ([[Ichthys|ICHTHYS]]), which means ''fish'':
 '''Ι'''ησούς    I  ''esous''   Jesus
 '''Χ'''ριστός   CH ''ristos''  Christ
 '''Θ'''εού      TH ''eou''     of God
 '''Υ'''ἱός      Y  ''ios''     son
 '''Σ'''ωτήρ     S  ''oter''    saviour

There is an acrostic secreted in the Dutch national anthem ''[[Het Wilhelmus]]''&lt;ref name=HetWilhelmus&gt;{{cite web

This was one of the hereditary titles of William of Orange ([[William the Silent]]), who introduces himself in the poem to the Dutch people. This title also returned in the 2010 [[speech from the throne]], during the [[Prinsjesdag|Dutch State Opening of Parliament]], whose first 15 lines also formed WILLEM VAN NASSOV.

[[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s short story "[[The Vane Sisters]]" is famous for its acrostic final paragraph, which contains a message from beyond the grave.

== Multiple acrostics ==
Acrostics can be more complex than just by making words from initials.  A double acrostic, for example, may have words at the beginning and end of its lines, as this example, on the name of [[Stroud, Gloucestershire|Stroud]], by Paul Hansford -
  '''S''' et among hills in the midst of  five valley '''S''',
  '''T''' his peaceful little   market town we inhabi '''T'''
  '''R''' efuses  (vociferously!) to  be  a  conforme '''R'''.
  '''O''' nce home  of  the cloth  it gave its name t '''O''',
  '''U''' phill and down again its  streets  lead  yo '''U'''.
  '''D''' espite its faults it leaves  us all  charme '''D'''.

The first letters make up the '''acrostich''' and the last letters the '''telestich'''; in this case they are identical.
[[image:Triple Acrostic by Thomas Browne.jpg|right|200px]]
The poem ''Behold, O God!'', by William Browne,&lt;ref name=WilliamBrowne&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.presscom.co.uk/leepriory/leebrowne.html
|title=WilliamBrowne:Behold O God!
|publisher=Presscom.co.uk
|accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be considered a complex kind of acrostic. 
In the manuscript, some letters are capitalized and written extra-large, non-italic, and in red, and the lines are shifted left or right and internally spaced out as necessary to position the red letters within three crosses that extend through all the lines of the poem. 
The letters within each cross spell out a verse from the [[New Testament]]:
*left: Luke 23:42: "'''Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.'''"  
*middle: Matthew 27:46: "'''O God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me'''?" 
*right: Luke 23:39: "'''If thou art the Christ, save thyself and us.'''"
The "[[INRI]]" at the top of the middle cross stands for ''Iēsus Nazarēnus, Rēx Iūdaeōrum'', Latin for "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#19:3|John 19:3]]). The three quotes represent the three figures crucified on Golgotha, as recorded in the gospels of Matthew and Luke.

(The text of the manuscript shown differs significantly from the text usually published, including in the reference.&lt;ref name=WilliamBrowne /&gt; Many of the lines have somewhat different wording; and while the acrostics are the same as far as they go, the published text is missing the last four lines, truncating the acrostics to "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kin", "O God, my God, why hast thou forsak", and "If thou art the Christ, save thyself". The manuscript text is printed below, first as normal poetry, then spaced and bolded to bring out the acrostics. The word "Thou" in line 8 is not visible in this photograph, but is in the published version and is included in a cross-stitch sampler of the poem from 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Legg|first=Sarah|title=a piece of antiquity: on the crucifixion of our saviour and the two thieves|url=http://i.imgur.com/kur6Oeg.jpg|accessdate=24 May 2014|date=April 2014}} &lt;br&gt;Described in {{cite web|title=Cross stitch tapestry from 1793 handed down in my family, titled 'a piece of antiquity: on the crucifixion of our saviour and the two thieves' by 13 year old Sarah Legg, England|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/236t8x/cross_stitch_tapestry_from_1793_handed_down_in_my/|work=reddit.com/r/history|accessdate=24 May 2014|author="CubicalBeaver"}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Behold, O God! In rivers of my tears
I come to thee! bow down thy blessed ears
To hear my Plaint; and let thine eyes which keep
Continual watch behold a Sinner weep:
Let not, O God my God my Sins, tho' great,
And numberless, between thy Mercy's-Seat
And my poor Soul have place; since we are taught,
''[Thou]'' Lord, remember'st thyne, if Thou art sought.
I come not, Lord, with any other merit
Than what I by my Saviour Christ inherit:
Be then his wounds my balm— his stripes my Bliss;
His thorns my crown; my death be blest in his.
And thou, my blest Redeemer, Saviour, God,
Quit my accounts, withhold thy vengeful rod!
O beg for me, my hopes on Thee are set;
And Christ forgive me, since thou'st paid my debt
The living font, the Life, the Way, I know,
And but to thee, O whither shall I go?
All other helps are vain: grant thine to me,
For in thy cross my saving health I see.
O hearken then, that I with faith implore,
Lest Sin and Death sink me to rise no more.
Lastly, O God, my course direct and guide,
In Death defend me, that I never slide;
And at Doomsday let me be rais'd again,
To live with thee sweet Jesus say, Amen.
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Amarna letter EA 252''', titled: ''Sparing One's Enemies,''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 252, ''Sparing One's Enemies'', pp. 305-306.&lt;/ref&gt; is a square, mostly flat [[clay tablet]] letter written on both sides, and the bottom edge. Each text line was written with a horizontal line scribed below the text line, as well as a vertical left margin-line, (beginning of text at left) scribe line on the obverse of the tablet. The letter contains 14 (15) lines on the obverse, continuing on the bottom tablet edge to conclude at line 31 on the reverse, leaving a small space before the final tablet edge. At least 4 lines from the obverse intrude into the text of the reverse (appearing as upside-down cuneiform into the text of the reverse), actually dividing the reverse into a top half and bottom half, and even creating a natural spacing [[segue]] to the reverse's text, and the story.

Letter EA 252 is authored by [[Labaya]], by the 'Man, [[city-state|city]]-state' (of) Šakmu ([[Shechem]] today), and written to the Pharaoh. The letter is one of three letters authored by him, to the Pharaoh.

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about [[1350 BC]] and 20–25 years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city Akhetaten, in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

==Brief letter summary==
The topic of the letter is Labaya's defense against other governors of city-states that he is engaged with. A town and statue were taken, and he defends his then follow-up actions of pursuit, to the pharaoh's commissioner. He states: "my parts are eaten/ I'm being slandered". The exact quote is ''"...he has slandered me, (and/ [[U (cuneiform)|u]]), I am slandered-([[ši (cuneiform)|ši]]-[[ir (cuneiform)|ir]]-[[TI (cuneiform)|ti]])."''

Directly next, an [[allegory]], lines 16-19, follows concerning "a pinched ant-defending itself". Basically, if an ant is attacked, should it just sit quiet, or defend against the "hand of the man" that attacks? Labaya then explains his justification for pursuing the men in warfare (Akkadian nukurtu, [[nu (cuneiform)|nu]]-[[KÚR (warfare Sumerogram)|KÚR]]-[[te (cuneiform)|te]], (last syllable most variable in spellings)),&lt;ref&gt;Parpola, 197l. ''The Standard Babylonian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Glossary, pp. 119-145, '''nukurtu''', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; and the events to follow.

'''''Buy the Bi and Bye''''' is an American play written by [[Felton Perry]] that was first staged in 1976 at the Actor's Theater in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=Street Life Inside and Outside LATC : Theater explores, with uneven results, multiethnic community in which it lives|date=March 12, 1989|author=Drake, Sylvie|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-12/entertainment/ca-1030_1_latino-theater}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A group of mostly [[African Americans|black]] actors gather at a theater to read through a fictional play called ''Killing Flo'' by a [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] [[White Americans|white]] writer-director.

==Reception==
The ''Progress Bulletin'' [[newspaper]] praised the 1976 premiere staging of the play calling it an "offbeat and hilarious black satire with a zinging performance by [[Ron Thompson (actor)|Ron Thompson]]."&lt;ref name=PB&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Progress Buelltin|title=Entertainment In The Valley|location=[[Pomona, California]]|date=7 February 1976|page=28|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/71730766/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the play was later performed in 1986 the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote "The voice of a keenly observant satirist is heard throughout "Buy the Bi and Bye," at the Richmond Shepard. Yet Felton Perry's play isn't as sharp as it must have been 10 years ago at Los Angeles Actors' Theatre."&lt;ref name=LAT2&gt;{{cite web|title='Buy The Bi And Bye' Gets A Bit Stale|date=June 20, 1986|author=Shirley, Don|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-20/entertainment/ca-11564_1_black-family|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT3&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|agency=[[Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/173624038/|title='Buy The Bi And Buy' Gets A Bit Stale|author=Shirley, Don|location=[[Los Angeles]], [[California]]|date=20 June 1986|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cartouche''' in [[cartography]] is a decorative [[emblem]] on a [[globe]] or [[map]].

Map cartouches may contain the title, the printer's address, date of publication, the scale of the map and legends, and sometimes a [[dedication]]. 

The design of cartouches varies according to cartographer and period style. On 15th-century maps they are modelled after [[Italy|Italian]] precedent (simple strapwork), by the 16th century architectural and figurative elements (like [[coats of arms]]) are added. The cartographic cartouche had its heyday in the [[Baroque]] period.
Toward the end of the 18th century ornamental effects in cartography became less popular, their style developed to simple oval or rectangular fields with inscriptions.

'''Robert Christopher Knight''' is a [[blog]]ger and [[film director|filmmaker]] based in [[North Carolina]] who received much attention for a video he uploaded to [[YouTube]] and a subsequent [[copyright infringement]] clash with [[Viacom]].  The incident has since gone on to be cited in numerous legal writings and court cases involving digital copyright and the interests of corporations versus independent content producers.

==Education==
Knight graduated from [[Rockingham County High School|Rockingham County Senior High School]] in 1992. He earned an [[Associate of Arts]] degree from [[Rockingham Community College]]. In 1999, he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Historical Studies from [[Elon University]].&lt;ref name="knightforboard.org"&gt;

==The "Star Wars" school board campaign commercial==
Knight ran for one of five new [[at-large]] seats on the [[Rockingham County, North Carolina]] [[Board of Education]] in 2006,&lt;ref name="co.rockingham.nc.us"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.co.rockingham.nc.us/schbdfil.htm | title=Candidate Filings 2006 | publisher= Rockingham County |quote=Age 32 as of 8/3/2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-produced a series of [[television advertisement|television commercials]] for his [[political campaign|campaign]].  Knight paid for airtime and the commercials were broadcast on [[WGSR-LD|WGSR Star 39]] from [[Reidsville, North Carolina]] in the month leading up to the November 7 election.

The first commercial that Knight created, dubbed simply "Christopher Knight for School Board Commercial #1",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLi5B0Iefsk YouTube and WGSR Star 39: Christopher Knight for School Board TV Commercial #1, October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; played off the [[Star Wars]] movies. In the one-minute spot, the [[Death Star]] destroys a tiny red [[One-room school|schoolhouse]] while a female [[voice acting|voice actress]] describes how legislation like [[No Child Left Behind]] has turned the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] into a "cosmic bully" that is "targeting and destroying our ability to best teach our children".  The second half of the commercial features Knight wielding a blue-bladed [[lightsaber]], describing how he is a [[Fiscal conservatism|"fiscal conservative"]] who wants more local control over the county's schools.  The commercial ends with Knight twirling the lightsaber in a flourish as he vows "to defend a bright and shining future for the children of Rockingham County".

Knight uploaded the commercial to [[YouTube]], and it soon became noticed by a larger audience. In the weeks before the election, it was featured in many regional [[newspaper]]s, was shown on the [[Fox News Channel]] and was mentioned in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/us/politics/02local.html "The New York Times: Local Issues Mirror National Ones, but the Special Effects Occasionally Stand Alone, November 6, 2006"]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, the "Star Wars" school board ad had aroused the attention of [[Edutopia]], the magazine of the [[George Lucas]] Educational Foundation, which declared Knight's commercial to be the "Best Campaign Ad Ever".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/viewings?page=2 "Edutopia: Best Campaign Ad Ever!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713184437/http://www.edutopia.org/viewings?page=2 |date=2007-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight aired two more commercials before the election, but he failed to win a seat. He came in 8th place out of 16 candidates who ran, which was the largest slate for a single race in Rockingham County history.

Over the next several months, Knight's commercial was screened at the [[American Film Institute]], and was featured on the [[Heritage Foundation]] website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritageblogs.org/index.php/958_school-board-jedi "The Heritage Foundation: School Board Jedi, July 9, 2007"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009192326/http://www.heritageblogs.org/index.php/958_school-board-jedi |date=October 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in many other media outlets including ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'', ''[[The Soup]]'', on [[MTV]] and numerous international programming.

==The VH1/Viacom/YouTube copyright infringement claim==
The [[television program]] ''[[Web Junk 20]]'' on [[VH1]] aired a special presentation titled "Animals and Other Crap" in July 2007. The show, which highlights funny and unusual video clips found on the Internet, showed Knight's first school board commercial along with commentary by host [[Aries Spears]]. Knight later said that no one from the network had approached him about using his commercial for a for-profit broadcast, or had even told him that it would be aired by the network. However, Knight also said that he thought that the show was so good and Spears' commentary to be so witty, that he didn't mind that VH1 used it at all. As he had done with his original commercial, Knight uploaded the ''Web Junk 20'' segment on YouTube so that he could share it with friends.

On August 29, 2007, YouTube notified Knight him that his video of the ''Web Junk 20'' clip had been taken down at the insistence of VH1's parent company [[Viacom]], claiming Knight's use of the clip was [[copyright infringement]] and violated the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA). Upon being presented with the claim, YouTube had no choice but to pull it per DMCA mandate. Knight objected, as ''Web Junk 20'' had lifted his own material, and claimed that Viacom had violated his copyright first.

Knight contended that per the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], his uploading of the ''Web Junk 20'' clip featuring his own commercial satisfied the four criteria for [[fair use]]. and that VH1's segment was a [[derivative work]] of his own, since the ''Web Junk 20'' clip was based on Knight's original commercial and could not have existed without it. Viacom countered that the ''Web Junk 20'' clip was indeed its own copyrighted material, acknowledging that although it used the commercial that Knight had produced himself, that VH1 had added Aries Spears's image and commentary. Viacom asserted that this was enough to make the entire content of the ''Web Junk 20'' clip, including use of Knight's commercial, their own material protected under copyright.

Following guidelines on YouTube's site, Knight filed a [[DMCA counter-notification|Digital Millennium Copyright Act counter-notification claim]],&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Christopher. [http://theknightshift.blogspot.com/2007/09/youtubeviacom-aftermath-part-2-dmca.html "YOUTUBE/VIACOM AFTERMATH - Part 2: The DMCA Counter-Notification Claim."] ''The Knight Shift.'' September 19, 2007. Retrieved November 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and per DMCA provisions, Viacom was legally bound to take one of two options: to take Knight to court and file a lawsuit against him for copyright infringement, or to let the video be restored on YouTube. After the story gained considerable press coverage, Viacom relented,&lt;ref&gt;Goel, Vindu. [http://www.mercextra.com/blogs/vindu/2007/09/11/followup-chris-knight-wins-battle-with-viacom-over-youtube-clip/ "Followup: Chris Knight wins battle with Viacom over YouTube clip."] ''Vindu's View from the Valley.''  September 11th, 2007. Retrieved November 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and YouTube reinstated Knight's clip of ''Web Junk 20'' featuring his campaign commercial.

The incident has since been referenced in several other stories regarding YouTube and cases of possible copyright infringement, including that of [[Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.|the Lenz family's lawsuit against Universal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3777651&amp;page=1 "The Home Video Prince Doesn't Want You to See."] ABC News. October 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding a clip they had posted onto YouTube that included several seconds of a song by [[Prince (musician)|musical artist Prince]].

After Viacom relented and dropped its claim, Knight asserted that he had no ill toward Viacom and asked his readers to do likewise. "This ends just as I had hoped it would: with the clip back up and, I like to think, with Viacom and me getting to shake hands and move on and wishing each other well. I'll certainly harbor no hard feelings toward Viacom for the past two weeks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theknightshift.com/2007/09/viacom-situation-update-youtube-has.html|title=VIACOM SITUATION UPDATE: YouTube has restored my clip|website=www.theknightshift.com|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Works ==
In late 2010 Knight used his blog to go public about his longtime diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]]. He has since devoted much effort toward sharing his experiences with severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[mania]], and the treatment of his disease. As of 2015 Knight is writing a book about his life with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].

Knight and his filmmaking partner Ed Woody are the founders of KWerky Productions. Knight's first film ''Forcery -'' a parody of the [[Misery (film)|film adaptation]] of the [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'' - was heavily featured in the award-winning documentary ''[[The People vs. George Lucas]]''.

Knight is a published op-ed writer who maintains that he is extremely [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]] and asks to not be considered as either a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] or a [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. He had stated numerous times that he refuses to vote for or endorse any candidate who produces even a single negative campaign ad against an opponent, without exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theknightshift.com/2012/01/tired-of-negative-political-ads-so-am-i.html|title=Tired of negative political ads?

He is active in [[community theatre]] and enjoys [[Knife making|knifemaking]]. As of 2016 Knight is traveling across the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theknightshift.com|title=The Knight Shift|website=theknightshift.com|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|

}}

The advent of [[radio drama]], [[film|cinema]] and in particular, television created greater pressure in [[marketing]] to clearly define a product as either comedy or drama. While in live theatre the difference became less and less significant, in mass media comedy and drama were clearly divided. Comedies were expected to keep a consistently light tone and not challenge the viewer by introducing more serious content.

By the early 1960s, television companies commonly presented half-hour-long "comedy" series or hour-long "dramas". Half-hour series were mostly restricted to situation comedy (sitcoms) or family comedy and were usually aired with either a live or [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] [[laugh track]]. One-hour dramas included such shows as police and detective series, westerns, science fiction, and serialized prime time soap operas.

Arguably, one of the first American television shows to successfully blend elements of comedy and drama together was Jackie Cooper's military-themed series, ''[[Hennesey]]''. Although the show featured a laugh track, it also contains many elements of character drama that occurred amongst the re-occurring characters and the guest stars. The laugh track wasn't excessively used in each episode; by the third season, it was eliminated completely from the series.

While sitcoms would occasionally balance their humor with more dramatic and humanistic moments, these remained the exception to the rule as the 1960s progressed. Beginning around 1969 in the US, there was a brief spate of half-hour shows that purposely alternated between comedy and drama and aired without a laugh track, as well as some hour-long shows such as ''[[CHiPs]]'' in the late 1970s to early 1980s. These were known as "comedy-dramas".

A notable early (1969-1974) example of this genre was the award-winning ''[[Room 222]]'', one of the first fully racially integrated television series. The episodes blended comedy with weighty subjects such as race relations, integrity, student smoking and mortality as well as topical issues such as the Vietnam War and the plight of returning war veterans.

The [[sitcom]] formula pioneered by [[Norman Lear]] in the 1970s in which a half-hour [[multi-camera]] [[situation comedy]] addressed serious issues in a dramatic format on [[videotape]] before a live studio audience is considered another type of comedy-drama hybrid. Examples of this genre include ''[[All in the Family]]'', {{citation needed|date=August 2018}} ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'',{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and ''[[One Day at a Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=O'Dell|first1=Cary|title=One Day at a Time|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/onedayata.htm|website=Encyclopedia of Television|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|date=October 25, 2013|accessdate=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example was ''[[The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd]]'', which aired from 1987 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Brinkmoeller|first1=Tom|title=Classic "Molly Dodd" Series Remains Locked Up, Awaiting 'Bail'|url=http://www.tvworthwatching.com/post/Classic-Molly-Dodd-Series-Remains-Locked-Up-Awaiting-Bail.aspx|website=TV Worth Watching|date=September 3, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the term "dramedy" was coined to describe the late 1980s wave of shows, including ''[[Hooperman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelley|first1=Bill|title=The Best And The Brightest Abc`s Hooperman -- The Hands-down Winner Of The Best New Show Of The Year -- Introduces A New Format, ``dramedy,`` While Slap Maxwell Reintroduces Dabney Coleman|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-09-23/features/8703150300_1_hooperman-lewis-erlicht-brandon-stoddard|work=[[Sun Sentinel]]|date=September 23, 1987|accessdate=September 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Frank's Place]]'', and ''[[Doogie Howser, M.D.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hill|first=Michael|title=Bochco gives dramedy another go with 'Doogie Howser, M.D.'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-06/news/tv-7_1_doogie-howser|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 6, 1989|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early shows influenced how general TV comedies and series (especially family themed sitcoms) were developed. They often included brief dramatic interludes and more serious subject matter. An example of a successful comedy-drama series that distinguished this genre in television was the series ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. It generated critical acclaim and was a highly rated series worldwide. Another example of a successful comedy-drama was the television series ''[[Eight Is Enough]]''. The show was distinct, because it was not a comedy-drama in the traditional sense. It was an hour-long series that used a laugh track, which was very unusual, but is considered a comedy-drama for the fact that it alternated between drama and comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Eight is Enough|url=https://fiftiesweb.com/tv/eight-enough/|website=Fifties Web|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the format first appeared successfully in 1979 with the long-running series ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]'', along with other notable comedy-dramas such as ''[[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]]'' and ''[[Big Deal (TV series)|Big Deal]].''

In addition, comedy-drama series have been associated with the [[single-camera setup|single-camera]] production format.

The '''culture of capitalism''' or '''capitalist culture''' is the set of social practices, social norms, values and patterns of behavior that are attributed to the capitalist economic system in a capitalist society. Capitalist culture promotes the [[accumulation of capital]] and the sale of commodities, where individuals are primarily defined by their relationship to business and the market. The culture is composed of people who, behaving according to a set of learned rules, act as they must act in order to survive in capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robbins|first= Richard |title= Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism |publisher= Pearson|date=2005|isbn= 978-0205917655|page = 13 |quote= The culture of capitalism is devoted to encouraging the production and sale of commodities. For capitalists, the culture encourages the accumulation of profit; for laborers, it encourages the accumulation of wages; for consumers, it encourages the accumulation of goods. In other words, capitalism defines sets of people who, behaving according to a set of learned rules, act as they must act }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of capitalist culture include the mindset of [[business]] and corporate culture, [[consumerism]] and working class culture.

==Capitalist culture and ideology==
While certain political ideologies, such as [[neoliberalism]], assume and promote the view that the behavior that capitalism fosters in individuals is natural to humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/20/human-nature-politics-left-right |title=Who's correct about human nature, the left or the right? |author=Ed Rooksby |date=2010 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=20 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/261927/two-cheers-capitalism-bruce-thornton |title=Two sheers for capitalism |author=Bruce Thornton |date=2016 |publisher=Frontpage Magazine |accessdate=24 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologists like [[Richard Robbins (anthropologist)|Richard Robbins]] point out that there is nothing natural about this behavior - people are not naturally dispossessed to accumulate wealth and driven by wage-labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robbins|first= Richard |title= Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism |publisher= Pearson|date=2005|isbn= 978-0205917655|page = 13 |quote= There is nothing natural about this behavior. People are not naturally driven to accumulate wealth. There are societies in which such accumulation is discouraged...People are not driven to work; in fact, contrary to popular notions, members of capitalist culture work far more than, say, people who live by gathering and hunting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political ideologies such as neoliberalism abstract the economic sphere from other aspects of society (politics, culture, family etc., with any political activity constituting an [[Economic interventionism|intervention]] into the natural process of the market, for example) and assume that people make rational exchanges in the sphere of market transactions. However, applying the concept of embeddedness to market societies, the sociologist Granovetter demonstrates that rational economic exchanges are actually heavily influenced by pre-existing social ties and other factors.&lt;ref name="granovetter"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Granovetter, M.|title=Economic action and social structure: the problem of embeddedness|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=91|pages=487|year=1985|id=|doi=10.1086/228311|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a capitalist system, society and culture revolve around business activity (the accumulation of capital). As such, business activity and the market exchange are often viewed as being absolute or "natural" in that all other human social relations revolve around these processes (or should exist to facilitate one's ability to perform these processes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nyu.edu/projects/ollman/docs/market_mystification.php |title=Market Mystification in Capitalist and Market Socialist Societies |author=[[Bertell Ollman]] |date= |publisher=[[New York University]] |accessdate=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robbins|first1=Richard|title=Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Die Hard'' series''' is an American [[Action film|action]] [[film series]] that originated with [[Roderick Thorp]]'s novel ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (1979 novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]''. All five films revolve around the character of [[John McClane]] (portrayed by [[Bruce Willis]]), a [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] police detective who continually finds himself in the middle of violent crises and intrigues where he is the only hope against disaster.&lt;ref name=nytmag&gt;{{cite news|last=Sternbergh|first=Adam|title=On the Enduring Appeal of ‘Die Hard’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/on-the-enduring-appeal-of-john-mcclane-and-die-hard.html?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_20130224&amp;pagewanted=all|access-date=February 25, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times Magazine|date=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films have grossed a combined $1.4 billion worldwide and received positive reviews from critics, except the fifth installment which was negatively received.

===''Die Hard'' (1988)===
{{Main|Die Hard}}
The first film begins on [[Christmas Eve]] when McClane comes to reunite with separated wife [[List of Die Hard characters#Holly Gennaro|Holly]] ([[Bonnie Bedelia]]) in [[Los Angeles]] at her company's Christmas party. Holly left to pursue her career with their two children, and uses her maiden name.

At the fictional [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Nakatomi Plaza]], [[East Germany|East German]] [[terrorist]]s break in and take the celebrants hostage. McClane escapes detection and hides throughout the building. He kills off the gang and learns their real plan, to steal $640 million in [[bearer bonds]] from the building's vault. In the finale, McClane shoots the terrorist leader, [[List of Die Hard characters#Hans Gruber|Hans Gruber]] ([[Alan Rickman]]), out the window to fall thirty stories.

It was released on July 15, 1988 to positive reviews and grossed $140.8 million worldwide.

===''Die Hard 2'' (1990)===
&lt;!-- Do not added Die Harder on this section. Die Harder is not an official title. --&gt;
{{Main|Die Hard 2}}
The second film takes place two years after the first, again on Christmas Eve. In [[Washington, D.C.]], McClane waits for his wife at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]]. Mercenaries led by former U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Stuart ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) take over the airport communication systems, stranding planes in the air, including the one with McClane's wife. Colonel Stuart wants to free a captured Latin American dictator ([[Franco Nero]]) en route to the airport. McClane discovers the plan, including a conspiracy between Stuart and an Army counter-terrorist unit sent to stop him. He foils their plans and provides a visual landing signal for the circling aircraft by exploding the villains' getaway plane.

It was released on July 4, 1990 to positive reviews and grossed $240 million worldwide.

===''Die Hard with a Vengeance'' (1995)===
{{Main|Die Hard with a Vengeance}}
In the third film, McClane is back in New York City, separated from his wife, suspended from the police force, and a borderline alcoholic. A terrorist known only as "Simon" ([[Jeremy Irons]]) threatens to blow up various locations in the city unless McClane will play his twisted version of [[Simon Says]], riddles and challenges.

Zeus Carver ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), a shopkeeper from [[Harlem]], saves McClane after the first challenge, and reluctantly continues to help. The FBI reveal Simon is the brother of Hans Gruber, killed in the first film. McClane learns revenge is a cover story for robbing the [[New York Federal Reserve]]. McClane tracks Simon to the Canada–US border. McClane kills Simon by shooting at a power line above Simon's helicopter.

It was released on May 19, 1995 to mixed reviews and grossed $366.1 million worldwide.

===''Live Free or Die Hard'' (2007)===
{{Main|Live Free or Die Hard}} 
The fourth film, which was released as '''''Die Hard 4.0''''' outside North America, takes place on Independence Day, over a decade after ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]''. McClane is divorced,  and estranged from his daughter [[John McClane#Lucy McClane|Lucy]] ([[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]). [[Cyber-terrorism|Cyber-terrorists]] hack into computers at the FBI, who had sent McClane to bring in [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] Matthew "Matt" Farrell ([[Justin Long]]) for questioning. Assassins hired by terrorist mastermind Thomas Gabriel ([[Timothy Olyphant]]) attempt to kill McClane and Farrell. Farrell tells McClane that the terrorists are actually in the middle of a "fire sale" — a crippling [[cyber-warfare]] attack on the national infrastructure: power, public utilities, traffic, and other computer-controlled systems. Although the terrorists capture Lucy and Farrell, McClane foils the criminals and saves the hostages.

It was released June 27, 2007 to positive reviews and grossed $383.5 million worldwide.

===''A Good Day to Die Hard'' (2013)===
{{Main|A Good Day to Die Hard}}
The fifth film is set a few years later, mostly in [[Moscow]], Russia and Chernobyl ([[Pripyat]]), Ukraine. McClane finds out that his estranged son John "Jack" McClane, Jr. ([[Jai Courtney]]) was arrested in Moscow for murder. When he arrives at the Moscow courthouse for Jack, Russian terrorists bomb the building and Jack escapes with imprisoned ex-billionaire Yuri Komarov ([[Sebastian Koch]]). In an intense car chase, McClane pursues and saves the pair. Jack, unhappy at the unexpected arrival, reluctantly picks up his father.

When they stop at a CIA safe house in Moscow, McClane learns Jack is a deep-cover CIA operative trying to get close to Komarov for his file that incriminates corrupt, high-ranking Russian official Viktor Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov). Chagarin's henchmen, led by his main enforcer Alik (Radivoje Bukvic), attack the safe house. McClane holds them off, and escapes with Jack and Komarov.

They retrieve a key for the file in Chernobyl, and meet Komarov's daughter Irina ([[Yuliya Snigir]]). Irina betrays them to Alik. The McClanes escape, without Komarov. Jack explains Komarov and Chagarin were partners in stealing weapons-grade uranium from Chernobyl, but enemies after the Chernobyl incident.

In Chernobyl, the McClanes learn Komarov wanted the weapons-grade uranium for himself, and killed Alik and Chagarin. Irina, always on the side of her father Komarov, tries to save him. McClane goes after Irina, while Jack chases her father. Jack throws Komarov off of the roof; he falls on the rotors of the helicopter and gets shredded to bits. When Irina tries to kill the McClanes, they jump into a pool of rainwater. Irina still crashes her helicopter into the building where they were, and dies in the explosion. The father and son walk away, reconciled.

It was released on February 14, 2013 to overwhelmingly negative reviews and grossed $304.7 million worldwide.

===Upcoming===
====''McClane'' (TBA)====
When the production was formally announced for the fifth film in the series, Bruce Willis expressed his desire to retire the John McClane character in a sixth and final film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruce Willis Fears Being Replaced in Die Hard 6|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/entertainment/bruce-willis-fears-being-replaced-in-die-hard-6_100441925.html|work=IANS|publisher=ThaIndian News|date=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruce Willis to Retire John McClane after Die Hard 5 &amp; 6|url=https://screenrant.com/bruce-willis-john-mcclane-die-hard-5-6/|work=Ben Moore|publisher=Screen Rant|date=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, returning director [[Len Wiseman]], who previously directed ''Live Free or Die Hard'', shared the film's working title as "[[Die Hard: Year One]]" on his [[Twitter]] feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=

By September 2017, Wiseman publicly floated that he was casting for a young version of John McClane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|url=https://deadline.com/2017/09/underworld-tv-series-len-wiseman-adaptation-of-movie-franchise-1202175668/#!|title=‘Underworld’: Len Wiseman Spearheading TV Series Adaptation Of Movie Franchise|date=September 17, 2017|publisher=Deadline|access-date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Six months later, the studio enlisted duo [[Chad Hayes (writer)|Chad Hayes]] and [[Carey W.

In July 2018, producer [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] submitted an updated script titled ''McCLANE'', further confirming that the storyline features elements of McClane's and Holly's characters in the 1970s, intermixed with their present-day counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Travis|first=Ben|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/die-hard-6-title-mcclane-exclusive/|title=New Die Hard 6's Title Is McClane - Exclusive|date=September 3, 2018|publisher=Empire Magazine|access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Nick|url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/09/03/die-hard-6-title-mcclane/|title=New Die Hard movie officially titled McClane|date=September 3, 2018|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Wiseman stated that pre-production on the new film should start "fairly soon" once the script has been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/die-hard-year-one-details/|title=The 'Die Hard: Year One' Script Features a Young Holly Gennero, Bruce Willis Will Help Cast the Young John McClane [Exclusive]|date=2018-08-03 | author = Fred Topel |work=/Film|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fox removed ''Die Hard'' from at least its 2019-2020 slate, in anticipation of (federal approval for) the [[Proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|Disney acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=staff|title=Disney wins: Comcast drops its bid for 21st Century Fox |url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/19/media/comcast-fox-disney/index.html|date=July 19, 2018|publisher=CNN Money|access-date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBCUniversal]] ([[Comcast]]) had bid for the rights to distribute the franchise.

===Other appearances===
The character John McClane also appears in the 1993 film ''[[Loaded Weapon 1]]'', which is also portrayed by Bruce Willis, in a brighter version.

==Source material for the films==
''[[Die Hard]]'' is adapted from the 1979 novel ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (Thorp novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'' by [[Roderick Thorp]].

''[[Die Hard 2]]'' was adapted from the 1987 novel ''[[58 Minutes]]'' by [[Walter Wager]].

''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' was adapted from a script called ''Simon Says'' by [[Jonathan Hensleigh]], which was also briefly considered to become the script for ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/movie-legends-revealed-die-hard-3-started-out-as-lethal-weapon-4/|title=Movie Legends Revealed - Die Hard 3 Started Out as Lethal Weapon 4? |publisher=CBR.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/50333/6-movies-were-almost-other-movies|title=6 Movies That Were Almost Other Movies|publisher=MentalFloss.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hook in Hensleigh's screenplay that captured the attention of director [[John McTiernan]] was the idea of a man being targeted for revenge by someone whose life he had unwittingly destroyed. Once the Simon character became the brother of [[List of Die Hard characters#Hans Gruber|Hans Gruber]] and the backstory was established, the project fully came together. It was novelized by Deborah Chiel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/452193.Die_Hard_With_a_Vengeance|title=Die Hard With a Vengeance|author=Deborah Chiel|work=Goodreads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'' was based on the 1997 article "A Farewell to Arms" written for ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine by [[John Carlin (journalist)|John Carlin]].&lt;ref name=Wired-Carlin-Fareweel-to-Arms&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlin|first=John|title=A Farewell to Arms|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]| date=May 1997 |issue=5.05|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.05/netizen.html|access-date=October 9, 2011|authorlink=John Carlin (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also drew on a script 20th Century Fox owned called "WW3.com", which dealt with a massive cyberterrorism attack against the U.S. and was nearly put into production in 2001 but ultimately abandoned because several elements in the story too closely resembled the [[September 11 attacks]].

''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'' was the first film in the series to come from an original screenplay, and not be based upon any prior works. The original screenplay was penned by [[Skip Woods]].

===Critical and public response===
Although the first ''Die Hard'' has been credited as one of the greatest action movies of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/best-action-movies|title=The 100 best action movies ever made|work=Time Out New York|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://whatculture.com/film/50-reasons-why-die-hard-is-the-greatest-action-movie-of-all-time|title=50 Reasons Why Die Hard Is The Greatest Action Movie Of All Time|date=2013-09-30|work=WhatCulture.com|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; critical reaction to its sequels has varied.

The original ''Die Hard'' received substantial praise. Pete Croatto of FilmCritic.com called the film "a perfect action movie in every detail, the kind of movie that makes your summer memorable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=''Die Hard'' | first=Pete | last=Croatto | url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/b1bdbb2b99c40a6d882567b6001b2b89?OpenDocument | publisher=FilmCritic.com | access-date=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] wrote that the film "represents the class of modern action pictures and the standard by which they must be judged."&lt;ref name="beradinelli"&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=James Berardinelli |first=James |last=Berardinelli |title=''Die Hard'' A movie review by James Berardinelli |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/die_hard.html |publisher=ReelViews.com |access-date=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Desson Howe]] wrote that "Willis has found the perfect vehicle to careen wildly onto the crowded L.A. freeway of ''Lethal Weapons'' and ''Beverly Hills Cops''."&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;{{cite news |first= Desson |last=Howe |authorlink=Desson Howe |title=''Die Hard'' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/diehardrhowe_a0b1af.htm |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 15, 1988 |access-date=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willis was also called "perfect as the wisecracking [[John McClane]]"&lt;ref name="beradinelli" /&gt; and "an excellent casting choice as a sardonic action hero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/12/15/die_hard_1988_review.shtml|title=BBC - Films - review - Die Hard|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Rickman]]'s portrayal of villain Hans Gruber was described as "marvelous"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/reviews.php?film_id=9091|title=Die Hard|work=eyeforfilm.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "a career-making performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/b1bdbb2b99c40a6d882567b6001b2b89?OpenDocument |title=Eye for Film: ''Die Hard'' Movie Review |first=Gator |last=MacReady|access-date=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gruber also ranked 46 on the villain side of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains]]. In 2007, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked ''Die Hard'' the greatest action film of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Action 25: The Best Rock-'em, Sock-'em Movies of the Past 25 Years |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20219939_24,00.html |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sequel, ''Die Hard 2'', received positive reviews, although not as many as the original.  Despite only giving the original film two stars, critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave this film three and a half stars and called it "terrific entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900703/REVIEWS/7030301/1023 |title=''Die Hard 2: Die Harder'' |authorlink=Roger Ebert |first=Roger |last=Ebert |date=July 3, 1990 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date=November 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] called the film "somewhat-muddled but still entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berardinelli|first=James|title=Die Hard 2|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/die_hard2.html|publisher=ReelViews|authorlink=James Berardinelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] wrote that "however impressively made, ''Die Hard 2'' begins to wear thin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949145/review/5949146/die_hard_2 |title=''Die Hard 2'' |authorlink=Peter Travers | first=Peter| last=Travers |date=February 8, 2001 |newspaper=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] |access-date=November 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third film, ''Die Hard with a Vengeance'', received mixed reviews.  [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''Entertainment Weekly'' stated that while "[[John McTiernan|McTiernan]] stages individual sequences with great finesse... they don't add up to a taut, dread-ridden whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,297354,00.html|title=Die Hard With a Vengeance - EW.com|author=Randall Wallace|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Berardinelli thought that the explosions and fights were "filmed with consummate skill, and were thrilling in their own right."&lt;ref name="Berardinelli"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/die_hard3.html|title=Die Hard with a Vengeance - Reelviews Movie Reviews|author=James Berardinelli|work=Reelviews Movie Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel L. Jackson]] also received praise for his role in the film. [[Desson Thomson|Desson Howe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' thought that "the best thing about the movie was the relationship between McClane and Zeus," saying that Jackson was "almost as good as he was in ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Desson|title=‘Die Hard With a Vengeance’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/diehardwithavengeancerhowe_c016b7.htm|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=September 7, 2011|authorlink=Desson Howe|date=May 19, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2164109/die-hard-with-a-vengeance-anniversary/|title=13 Reasons 'Die Hard With A Vengeance' Is The Only 'Die Hard' You Need|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth film, ''Live Free or Die Hard'', received highly positive reviews. [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' claimed that the film "is the best in the series, an invigorating return to the style of blockbuster that dominated summers back in the early 1990s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Old-school, bare-knuckle action – McClane delivers and then some |first=Mick |last=LaSalle |authorlink=Mick LaSalle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/26/DDG56QKKFM1.DTL&amp;type=movies |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=June 26, 2007 |access-date=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[USA Today]]'' film critic Claudia Puig said that the film "delivers when it comes to kick-butt, action-packed mayhem," but "as a convincing techno-thriller, it doesn't really work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Puig|first=Claudia|title=Techno stuff shuts down the action in 'Die Hard'  |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2007-06-25-die-hard_N.htm |work=[[USA Today]]|date=June 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth film, ''A Good Day to Die Hard'', received mostly negative reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a rating of 14% based on 223 reviews, making it the worst-reviewed film of the series.&lt;ref name="rt-dh5" /&gt; Critics lambasted the installment for "[entering] generic action movie territory", as written by reviewer James Bernardinelli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2588|title=Good Day to Die Hard, A - Reelviews Movie Reviews|author=James Berardinelli|work=Reelviews Movie Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a "cliched [and] uninspired script". Peter Rainer of Christian Science Monitor wrote, "John's appeal was always his ordinariness, but director John Moore has him surviving more explosions than Wile E. Coyote, and with hardly a scratch."&lt;ref&gt;['A Good Day to Die Hard' makes John McClane a little too invincible (+video) - CSMonitor.com]&lt;/ref&gt; A.O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' also commented that the series has taken a downfall with the movie, saying "Everything that made the first "Die Hard" memorable—the nuances of character, the political subtext, the cowboy wit—has been dumbed down or scrubbed away entirely."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/movies/a-good-day-to-die-hard-with-bruce-willis.html|title=‘A Good Day to Die Hard,’ With Bruce Willis|last=Scott|first=A. O.|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willis has however, been cited as the film's redeeming quality, with Chris Vognar of [[Dallas Morning News]] saying "Willis' presence at least provides undercurrents of easy jocularity."

[[CinemaScore]] polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the series entries grades of "A+", "A", "A-", "A-", "B+" respectively on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="DHcs" /&gt;

===''A Die Hard Christmas''===
The official description read:
{{Quote|A delightful Christmas storybook for adults based on the action-packed ''[[Die Hard]]'' movie

All [[John McClane]] wants for [[Christmas]] is to reunite with his estranged family. But when his wife’s office holiday party turns into a deadly hostage situation, he has to save her life before he can get home in time for Christmas!

The unconventional fan-favorite movie ''Die Hard'' is now an illustrated storybook—complete with machine guns, European terrorists, and a cop who’s forced to rely on all his cunning and skills (and the help of a fellow officer) to save the day. Based on the classic “''[[Night Before Christmas]]''” poem and filled with whimsical illustrations, this cleverly reimagined homage is destined to become a holiday classic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7503">In [[academia]], a '''Festschrift''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfɛstʃrɪft}}; [[plural]], ''Festschriften'' {{IPA-de|ˈfɛstʃrɪftən|}}) is a book honoring a respected person, especially an [[academic]], and presented during their lifetime. It generally takes the form of an [[edited volume]], containing contributions from the honoree's colleagues, former pupils, and friends.

The term, borrowed from [[German language|German]], and literally meaning "party-writing" (cognate with "feast-script"), might be translated as "celebration publication" or "celebratory (piece of) writing". An alternative Latin term is ''liber amicorum'' (literally: “book of friends”). A comparable book presented posthumously is sometimes called a '''Gedenkschrift''' ("memorial publication"), but this term is much rarer in English.

==Description==
Originating in Germany before World War I, this European tradition of honoring special achievements in science and culture was carried to the United States by scientists who escaped the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Irving Louis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qcr1RD5ABbkC&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;ots=k58vm0ExlM&amp;dq=Irving%20Louis%20Horowitz%20Scholarly%20Publishing%201990%20%20&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Communicating Ideas: The Politics of Scholarly Publishing.''] New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ricki Lewis. [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/18041/title/Festschriften-Honor-Exceptional-Scientific-Careers--Scholarly-Influences/ Festschriften Honor Exceptional Scientific Careers, Scholarly Influences], ''The Scientist,''  September 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 20th century, the practice became used internationally. Since no English term for such a book to mark a special occasion had been in use, the German word ''Festschrift'' has been incorporated into the English language and is frequently used without the italics that designate a foreign term, although the capitalization of the first letter is usually retained from German. Its plural may be either the original ''Festschriften'' or anglicized as "Festschrifts".&lt;ref name="Michael2004"&gt;{{cite book | author = Michael Agnes, editor in chief | title = Webster's New World College Dictionary, ''fourth edition''  | publisher = Wiley Publishing | year = 2004 | pages = 524 | isbn = 0-02-863118-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festschriften are often titled something like ''Essays in Honour of...'' or ''Essays Presented to... .''

A Festschrift compiled and published by electronic means on the internet is called a '''Webfestschrift''' (pronounced either {{IPA|[vɛp-]}} or {{IPA|[wɛb-]}}), a term coined by the editors of the late [[Boris Marshak]]'s Webfestschrift, ''Eran ud Aneran'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/ |title=Eran ud Aneran - Transoxiana Webfestschrift Series 2003 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |issn=1666-7050 |website= |publisher=Transoxiana.org |accessdate=2013-10-08}}
*Information on how the term ''Webfestschrift''" was coined can be found in [http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/introduction.html Introduction to the Electronic Version of ''Webfestschrift Marshak'' 2003].
*Book form: {{cite book |authorlink= |title=Ērān Ud Anērān: Studies Presented to Boris Il'ič Maršak on the Occasion of His 70th Birthday |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJi4AAAACAAJ |accessdate= |year=2006 |publisher=Libreria Editrice Cafoscarina |location=Venice |isbn=9788875431051 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published online in October 2003. The corresponding ''Webgedenkschrift'' does not appear to be in frequent use {{as of|lc=y|2015|7}}.&lt;ref&gt;Google search turns up no results for [https://www.google.com/#safe=off&amp;q=Webgedenkschrift "Webgedenkschrift"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Festschrift contains original contributions by the honored academic's close colleagues, often including their former [[doctorate|doctoral]] students. It is typically published on the occasion of the honoree's retirement, significant birthday, or other notable career anniversary. A Festschrift can be anything from a slim volume to a work in several volumes. ''[[Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt]]'', for example, began in 1972 as a Festschrift to commemorate the 75th birthday of [[Joseph Vogt]], a German classical historian. Four volumes were planned, but it has since reached 89 volumes (including several which were planned for the next years, but put on hold in 1998). The essays usually relate in some way to, or reflect upon, the honoree's contributions to their scholarly field, but can include important original research by the authors. Many Festschriften also feature a ''tabula gratulatoria'', an extended list of academic colleagues and friends who send their best wishes to the honoree.

In the case of prominent academics, several Festschriften might be prepared by various groups of students and colleagues, particularly if the scholar made significant contributions to different fields.

In Germany it is an honor to be designated to prepare such a collection, and being selected by a prominent academic to edit a Festschrift, according to [[Claudio Naranjo]], can symbolize the proverbial passing of the torch.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Naranjo. [http://www.claudionaranjo.net/navbar_english/festschrift_english.html Festschrift]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Endel Tulving]], a Canadian neuroscientist, proposed that "a Festschrift frequently enough also serves as a convenient place in which those who are invited to contribute find a permanent resting place for their otherwise unpublishable or at least difficult-to-publish papers."&lt;ref name="Tulving"&gt;{{cite book |author=Endel Tulving |authorlink=Endel Tulving |editor=James S. Nairne |chapter=Are there 256 different kinds of memory? |title=The foundations of remembering: essays in honor of Henry L. Roediger III |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eoh9AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;q=%22Festschrift+frequently+enough%22 |accessdate= |year=2007 |publisher=Psychology Press |location= |isbn=9781841694467 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Irving Louis Horowitz]] summarized, "''Festschriften'' persist and multiply. Why? Because they are not  just retrospective, but prospective. That is to say the ''Festschrift'' is a ''Beruf'', a call to further work, effort, and energy, a call to the improvement of learning, of a discipline, a science, an artistic vision, or an intellectual position. Even in this age of mass ''Festschriften'', they remain a special literary genre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating Ideas: The Politics of Scholarly Publishing|first=Irving Louis|last=Horovitz|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Alan Soble]], in a review of a Festschrift in honor of [[MIT]]'s philosopher [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]] proposed 13 conditions that must be satisfied by any adequate Festschrift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soble|first=Alan G.|url=http://commons.pacificu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1072&amp;context=eip|title=Review of ''Fact and Value: Essays on Ethics and Metaphysics for Judith Jarvis Thomson''|journal=Essays in Philosophy|volume=4|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Frank G. Bowe''' (1947 &amp;ndash; August 21, 2007) was the Dr. Mervin Livingston Schloss Distinguished Professor for the Study of Disabilities at [[Hofstra University]]. As a disability rights activist, author, and teacher, he accomplished a series of firsts for individuals with disabilities.

==Early life and education==
Bowe held a M.A. from [[Gallaudet University]] and a B.A. ([[summa cum laude]]) from [[McDaniel College]]. His [[Ph.D]] in educational psychology (research) was earned at [[New York University]]. NYU awarded him its Distinguished Alumni Award.{{when|date=April 2012}} Gallaudet awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Laws ([[LL.D]]), and McDaniel College has recognized him with two alumni achievement awards.{{when|date=April 2012}}

==Career==

=== "Father of Section 504" ===
Bowe was the first executive director (CEO) of the first national cross-disability consumer advocacy organization, the [[American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities]] (ACCD).  The Coalition’s signature achievement was securing the long-delayed implementation of [[Section 504]], the world’s first civil-rights provision for persons with disabilities. Bowe conceived and led the nationwide protest that led to issuance of landmark regulations for Section 504 in 1977. He later wrote ''Handicapping America'', the first full-length text on social policy and disability, which was published by [[Harper &amp; Row]].

In 1980, Bowe was the first person with a disability to represent any nation in the planning of the [[United Nations]] (UN) [[International Year of Disabled Persons]] (IYDP-1981). Today, many countries are represented in key UN committees by persons who themselves are individuals with [[disabilities]], including 14 who are, as Bowe was, deaf.

In the mid-1980s, he chaired the U.S. Congress Commission on Education of the Deaf (COED), which made 52 recommendations for improving education and rehabilitation. COED issued a public draft of its final report in January, 1988. The example he and COED set was not lost on the students at [[Gallaudet University]] across town when, in March, 1988, they launched the [[Deaf President Now]] protest.

Section 504 led, in 1990, to the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]]. That same year, Bowe was the principal architect of the Television Decoder Circuitry Act, which was sponsored in the Senate by [[Tom Harkin]] and in the House by [[Edward Markey]]. The act requires that [[television|TV sets]] receive and display [[closed captions]]. The 1996 Telecommunications Act took it a step further, mandating that [[broadcast]] and cable programs themselves be captioned. In 2005 and 2006, Bowe gave invited testimony before the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] Committee on Energy and Commerce and conducted demonstrations of high-speed broadband communications for both the House and the [[U.S. Senate]].

Bowe’s textbooks are in use at colleges and universities around the country and in several other nations. ''Making Inclusion Work'' ([[Prentice Hall]]) and ''Early Childhood Special Education'' (Thomson Delmar Learning) are two examples. He was also author of ''Universal Design in Education'' (published by Greenwood Publishing), of the encyclopedia entries on deafness and disabilities in Scholastic’s ''New Book of Knowledge'', and of several hundred articles in professional journals in public policy, special education, rehabilitation, and technology.

In ''Disability in America 2006'', a policy paper addressing health care, employment, and entitlements, Bowe outlined disability policy goals for 2006-2008.

=== Hofstra University ===
As a professor at [[Hofstra University]] on [[Long Island]], Bowe helped to prepare more than 2,000 special-education teachers. He was given the Distinguished Teaching (University Teacher of the Year) Award in 1996. For five years, he was program director for special education. He also chaired several committees at Hofstra and served on doctoral dissertation committees at NYU and other universities.

In 2006, he spearheaded a campus-wide project to make information and instruction more accessible to and usable by students, faculty, staff and alumni at Hofstra. The professor served on the editorial board of five professional journals and as governmental affairs consultant for the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)]].

== Selected quotes ==
*"America handicaps disabled people. And because that is true, we are handicapping America itself". (''Handicapping America'', 1978, p. vii)
*"The present status of education for persons who are deaf in the United States is unsatisfactory. Unacceptably so. This is the primary and inescapable conclusion of the Commission on Education of the Deaf." (''Toward Equality: Education of the Deaf'', 1988, p. viii)
*"[[SSDI]] and [[Supplemental Security Income|SSI]] ... the rapid escalation of costs and the narrowing of employer [health insurance] coverage ... and other factors ... keep the American Dream out of reach for many Americans with disabilities." ("Disability in America," 2006)
*"...[t]ake some of the money now spent on entitlements and turn it, instead, toward postsecondary education and vocational training for Americans with disabilities. ... take some (much less!) of it and put it toward real enforcement of [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] title I by the [[EEOC]]. And ... take some (more) of it and partially subsidize employer-provided [[health insurance]], as an incentive for hiring adults with disabilities." ("Disability in America", 2006)

== Awards ==
Bowe is named in numerous Who’s Who publications, including ''Who’s Who in the World'', ''Who’s Who in  Education'', and others. In 1994, Bowe was inducted into the National Hall of Fame for Persons with Disabilities.  In 1992, he received the Distinguished Service Award of the President of the United States, signed by then-President [[George H. W. Bush]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2305">'''Jewish Futurism''' is used in three different contexts: religious, artistic and futures studies (foresight, futurology etc.)

== Religious context ==
Jewish Futurism is encapsulated in the expectation of the [[messiah]] in the future rather than "recognizing him in the presence of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Körtner U. H. J. ''The End of the World: a Theological Interpretation'', 1995, John Knox Press, Louisville Kentucky,  p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the prophets the future is an "open field of human hope and responsibility.... the future [is] not predetermined ... human beings shape it". According to the Protestant theologian [[Harvey Cox]] "Prophecy insists that the future will be shaped not by  ... irresistible inherent tendencies but by what men decide to do...."&lt;ref&gt;Cornish E., ''The Study of the Future'', 1977, World Future Society, Washington, D.C., pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jews who are futurists==
* [[Alvin Toffler]]
* [[Fred Polak]]
* [[Herman Kahn]]
* [[Ray Kurzweil]]
* [[Dennis Gabor]]
* [[Faith Popcorn]]
* [[Robert Jungk]]
* [[Jeremy Rifkin]]
* [[Arthur Shostak]]

==Israeli futurists==
* Moshe Dror, president of the [http://www.wnrf.org/cms/index.shtml  World Network of Religious Futurists]
* Tsvi Bisk, director of the [http://www.futurist-thinking.co.il/ Center for Strategic Futurist Thinking]
* [[Yehezkel Dror]], founder of the [[Jewish People Policy Planning Institute]]
* [[David Passig]], head of the [http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~passig/vrworld.html Virtual Reality Lab] at [[Bar-Ilan University]]

A particular place on this list should be reserved for the practitioners of [[Foresight (futures studies)|foresight]]. Foresight is a tool for developing ''visions'', understood as possible future states of affairs that actions today can help bring about (or avoid). The practice of foresight is widespread in European strategic thinking, and to a much lesser level in Canada or United States. In Israel, foresight projects are developed at the [http://www.ictaf.tau.ac.il/index.asp Interdisciplinary Center for Technology Assessment and Forecasting] from Tel Aviv University.

This article details the '''geographical distribution of speakers of the [[French language]]''', regardless of the legislative status within the countries where it is spoken. [[French-based creole languages|French-based creoles]] are considered separate languages for the purpose of this article.

French became an international language in the [[Middle Ages]], when the power of the [[Kingdom of France]] made it the second international language, alongside Latin. This status continued to grow into the 18th century, by which time French was the language of European courts and diplomacy. The importance of French began to wane in the early 20th century, when the spread of English due to the British Empire and the rise of the English-speaking [[United States]] to superpower status eroding its place as the language of diplomacy.&lt;ref name=latdecline&gt;{{cite news|title=Seduction Still Works: French, a Language in Decline|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-03-01/news/mn-13048_1_french-language/2|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402224818/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-03-01/news/mn-13048_1_french-language/2#|archive-date=2015-04-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2014 estimate by the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]], 274 million people worldwide can speak French, of which 212 million use the language daily, while the remaining 62 million have learnt it as a foreign language.&lt;ref name=rtbf274&gt;{{cite news|title=La langue française réunit 274 millions de personnes dans le monde|url=http://www.rtbf.be/culture/litterature/detail_la-langue-francaise-reunit-274-millions-de-personnes-dans-le-monde?id=8400114|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=RTBF Litterature|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107072308/http://www.rtbf.be/culture/litterature/detail_la-langue-francaise-reunit-274-millions-de-personnes-dans-le-monde?id=8400114#|archive-date=2015-01-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a decline in the number of learners of French in Europe, the overall number of speakers is rising, largely because of its presence in high-fertility African countries: of the 212 million who use French daily, 54.7% are living in Africa.&lt;ref name=rtbf274/&gt;

===Argentina===
From the second half of the 19th century to the first half of the 20th century, Argentina received the second largest group of French immigrants worldwide, second only to the United States. Between 1857 and 1946 Argentina received 239,503 French immigrants - of whom 105,537 permanently settled in the country. In 1976 116,032 were settled in Argentina. France was the third source of immigration to Argentina before 1890, constituting over 10% of immigrants, only surpassed by Italians and Spaniards. Today more than 6 million Argentines have some degree of French ancestry (up to 17% of the total population), many of them French-speakers.

As the Lebanese people historically call France ''la tendre mère'' (English: The Tender Mother), not only is speaking French in Lebanon common and encouraged,{{fact|date=August 2016}} but it is also a [[self-identification]] with the French liberal and cultural spirit that was mainly the result of the French colonial period and educational, [[Christian]] religious and governmental enterprises. However, most Lebanese privilege French out of fascination and infatuation with the culture, not for any functional purposes.

While the Article 11 of Lebanon's Constitution states that "Arabic is the official national language, a law determines the cases in which the French language is to be used".

Today, French and English are secondary languages of [[Lebanon]], with about 40% of the population being [[Francophone]] and 40% Anglophone.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=217}} The use of English is growing in the business and media environment. Out of about 900,000 students, about 500,000 are enrolled in Francophone schools, public or private, in which the teaching of mathematics and scientific subjects is provided in French.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=218}} Actual usage of French varies depending on the region and social status. One third of high school students educated in French go on to pursue higher education in English-speaking institutions. English is the language of business and communication, with French being an element of social distinction, chosen for its emotional value.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=358}} On social media, French was used on Facebook by just 10% of Lebanese in 2014, far behind English (78%).&lt;ref name=socialmedia/&gt;

Home of the first [[Alliance Française]] in the [[Southeast Asia]] (founded in 1912), it continues to educate many Filipinos and expatriates in the said language. There are currently two branches of Alliance Française in the Philippines, that of Manila and Cebu.

Although the language is not offered in elementary school, former President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] issued a proclamation encouraging the language to be an elective in high school. Also, French, along with [[Spanish language|Spanish]], is a popular foreign language offered in many universities in the country. The [[University of the Philippines]] offers a bachelor's degree in European Languages, where French is one of the possible majors.

===Singapore===
In [[Singapore]], the top 10% of [[Primary School Leaving Examination]] graduates may choose to opt for French as a second or third language in secondary school, though the language is not an official language in [[Singapore]], and is not commonly spoken among locals.

===Syria===
Syria, as well as Lebanon were French [[League of Nations Mandate]]s following [[World War I]], which put French language as one of the main official language in Syria. Following independence, French was demoted as the official language of Syria, but it remained taught alongside [[English language|English]] in schools as the second foreign language. French remains widely spoken among intellectuals and members of the upper class in Syria and most educated Syrians are trilingual, speaking Arabic, English and French. 

French is mostly popular in the cities of [[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]] where the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle and l’École Française, Syria's only two French schools, are located respectively.

In [[Jersey]], a standardized variety of French called [[Jersey Legal French]] is an official language. However, its use is generally restricted to parliament formalities or legal codes and contracts. In [[Guernsey]], English is the only official language, although French is sometimes used in legislation with a ceremonial capacity. Nevertheless, [[Norman language|Norman]] (in its local forms, [[Guernésiais]] and [[Jèrriais]]) is the historical [[vernacular]] of the islands.

Francophone Algerians can be divided into three broad categories: 'real Francophones', who speak French as part of their daily lives and mostly come from a privileged background; 'casual Francophones', who use the language in certain contexts, alternating it with Arabic, and 'passive Francophones', who can understand French but do not speak it.&lt;ref name=berba&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berbaoui|first1=Nacer|title=La francophonie en Algérie|url=http://manifest.univ-ouargla.dz/documents/Archive/Archive%20Faculte%20des%20Lettres%20et%20des%20Langues/seminaires%20facultes%20des%20lettres/enseignement-apprentissage-du-francais-en-Algerie/BERBAOUI_Nacer.pdf|publisher=Université de Béchar|accessdate=29 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010205656/http://manifest.univ-ouargla.dz/documents/Archive/Archive%20Faculte%20des%20Lettres%20et%20des%20Langues/seminaires%20facultes%20des%20lettres/enseignement-apprentissage-du-francais-en-Algerie/BERBAOUI_Nacer.pdf#|archive-date=2017-10-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first French-medium school was established in [[Egypt]] in 1836, and the importance of French expanded throughout the second half of the 19th century, until it became the most common foreign language in the country.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=216}} At the time, it was also a [[lingua franca]] for the communities of foreign origin, especially in [[Cairo]].{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=216}}

French began to lose ground in Egyptian society in the 1920s for a number of political and social reasons;{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=216}} from the 1930s onwards English became the main foreign language, but French was still being learnt by 8 million Egyptians in 2013.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=217}} There are two French-speaking universities in the country, the [[Université Française d'Égypte]] and the [[Senghor University|Université Senghor]].{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=217}}

French is spoken by elderly people in the educated class who are over 40 years old. These people are more eloquent in this language because French was the main language used in education many years back before English prevailed and became the most preferred language of teaching. French is, however, starting to gain more prevalence as many young people are now attending French schools compared to before. As a result of this, the number of young people speaking French has risen to match those speaking English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url= http://www.studycountry.com/guide/EG-language.htm|title= Languages in Egypt|access-date= 2017-08-10|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170810210613/http://www.studycountry.com/guide/EG-language.htm#|archive-date= 2017-08-10|dead-url= no|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

French is a working language in many sectors in [[Tunisia]], including healthcare, commerce or communication. In coastal areas and the more developed neighbourhoods of the capital, it is also a common language of communication for all social groups, either in its standardised form or hybridized with Arabic. In the inland regions and the south it remains a foreign language. French is introduced from the third grade at 8 hours per week. In high school French is the language of instruction for mathematics, science and computing. Teachers are not always sufficiently trained for this usage, however.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=215}}

According to the High Council of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organization of the Francophonie]], in 2010, 96.2 million French speakers were living in various countries in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francophonie.org/IMG/pdf/Synthese-Langue-Francaise-2010.pdf|last=Wolff|first=Alexandre|title=La langue française dans le monde 2010 (synthèse) [The French language in the 2010 world (summary)]|publisher=Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|edition=Nathan|year=2011|language=French|access-date=2015-04-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405071540/http://www.francophonie.org/IMG/pdf/Synthese-Langue-Francaise-2010.pdf#|archive-date=2015-04-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; French has been imported to most of these countries through colonization, and it is not a [[mother tongue]] to most residents. African standards of French differ from European ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1994_num_104_1_5735|last=Manessy|first=G|title=Pratique du français en Afrique noire francophone [The practice of French in francophone black Africa]|journal=Langue française|volume=104|year=1994|pages=11–19|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some linguists discuss a "second French language"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafage|first=S|title=Le français d’afrique noire à l’aube de l’an 2000: éléments de problématique [French in black Africa at the dawn of 2000: problematic elements]|location=Paris|publisher=Université Paris III|year=1998|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even an "African French language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dumont|first=Pierre|title=Le français langue africaine [The African French language]|location=Paris|publisher=l'Harmattan|year=1990|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Paul Wald, "The notion of ownership of an imported language begins when – despite its identification as a foreign and/or vernacular language – its use does not imply a relationship with the foreigner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1994_num_104_1_5743|last=Wald|first=Paul|title=L'appropriation du français en Afrique noire: une dynamique discursive [The appropriation of French in black Africa: a dynamic discourse]|journal=Langue française|volume=104|year=1994|pages=115–124|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; French can thus be considered the result of functional and [[vernacular]] ownerships, satisfying the needs of a society with new [[Sociocultural linguistics|sociocultural]] and [[socioeconomic]] realities. French has begun developing into almost independent varieties, with creation of different types of [[slang]] by speakers with a sufficient knowledge of French. Examples include the [[Languages of Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian]] jargon "[[Nouchi]]" in [[Abidjan]] and the Cameroonian "[[Camfranglais]]", which is a mixture of French and English with elements of indigenous languages.

===Benin===

There are strong regional differences, with the ability to speak French being more common in the south of the country. The [[Atlantique Department|Atlantique]] and [[Littoral Department|Littoral]] departments have a French-speaking majority. French speakers are more commonly men than women, owing to a disparity in access to education.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=87}}

Two thirds of respondents report feeling Francophone.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=78}} French plays an important role in all areas of public and private life across the whole country. French is increasingly seen as an Ivorian language, and a local variety distinct from standard French has emerged ([[:fr:Français de Côte d'Ivoire|français ivoirien]]).{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=139}}

===Madagascar===
{{see also|Languages of Madagascar}}

===Rwanda===
{{See also|Languages of Rwanda}}
French became the administrative language of [[Rwanda]] in 1916. The [[Genocide against the Tutsi]] in 1994 and the victory of the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] were followed by a period of linguistic upheaval, with the return of refugees from Anglophone countries setting the stage for the officialisation of English in 1996 and the gradual usurpation of French as the language of education, culminating in the decision in October 2008 to make English the main language of education at higher levels,{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=126}} effectively relegating French to the status of third language.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=230}} Nevertheless, a survey of students in [[Kigali]] found that French was known by a majority of them.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=67}}

===Senegal===
{{See also|Languages of Senegal}}
French is the sole official language of [[Senegal]].&lt;ref name=bookoffact/&gt; French was commonly spoken by 9.4% of Senegalese in 2002, mainly as a second language, with just 0.6% speaking it natively.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=84}} [[Wolof language|Wolof]] is by far the most spoken language in the country, including the capital, while French remains a second language, becoming the main language only in non-Wolof areas. French is the main language of institutions, however.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=83}} Only half of [[Dakar]] residents identify with a Francophone status or feel solidarity with French-speaking countries, but the French language is seen as essential for everyday affairs and education.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=78}}

French was the language of literacy for 37.2% of the population in 2013, followed by Arabic at 11.1%. French is the main language of education in all [[regions of Senegal]] except for [[Kaffrine Region|Kaffrine]], where Arabic remains dominant, with significant Arabic-educated minorities in [[Kaolack Region|Kaolack]] (15.9% to 33.0% for French), [[Louga Region|Louga]] (15.8% to 22.7%) and [[Diourbel Region|Diourbel]] (15.0% to 17.2%).

'''George Henderson''' (18 February 1866 – 26 June 1912) was a scholar of [[Scottish Gaelic]].

==Life==
Henderson was born on 18 February 1866 in [[Heughden]], [[Kiltarlity]], [[Inverness-shire]], in Scotland.  He went to [[Raining's School]] in [[Inverness]], where he was taught by [[Alexander MacBain]], a [[lexicographer]] of Scottish.  He then attended the [[University of Edinburgh]], studying English literature, philosophy and Celtic.  After graduating in 1888, he became the examiner for the MA in Celtic. He then worked in [[South Uist]] in 1892, collecting oral Gaelic literature, before travelling to [[Vienna]] in 1893 and obtaining his doctorate.  On his return in 1896, he studied at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], and obtained a BLitt on Scottish Gaelic dialects.  He married in [[Iffley]] near Oxford in May 1901 before his ordination as a [[Church of Scotland]] minister in June 1901.

He served the parish of [[Eddrachillis]], [[Sutherland]], until 1906 when he was appointed as a lecturer in Celtic at the [[University of Glasgow]].

He had in the interim obtained a collection of Gaelic folksongs and tunes from the [[Isle of Skye]], collected by [[Frances Tolmie]], and these were published by the [[Folksong Society]] in 1911 upon his recommendation.

He was an admirer of the work of [[John Francis Campbell]] and after Campbells' death in 1885 Henderson started working on Campbells unfinished book ''The Celtic Dragon Myth'', eventually published in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/cdm/index.htm The Celtic Dragon Myth]&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson contributed some translation work, provided an extensively detailed introduction, and completed the editing of the manuscript for its eventual publication.

He died aged 46 in [[Rutherglen]] on 26 June 1912.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/56942|title=Henderson, George (1866&amp;ndash;1912)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004|last=Campbell|first=J. L.|author2=Matthew, H. C. G.|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Henderson had a large output of published material, although his work was sometimes inconsistent.  His principal works include the following:&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

* John Morison's ''Dain Iain Ghobha'' (1893&amp;ndash;96), a two-volume collection and edition (with a memoir) of religious Gaelic verse.
* Publications in ''[[Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie]]'' on Scottish Gaelic dialects (the result of his BLitt at Oxford)
* ''Leabhar nan Gleann'' (1898)
* An edition of ''[[Fled Bricrend]]'' for the Irish Texts Society (1899)
* ''The Norse Influence on Celtic Scotland'' (1910)
* ''Survivals in Belief among the Celts'' (1911)
* ''Arthurian Motifs in Gadhelic Literature'' (1912)

'''[[Haiti]]''' has a sizable diaspora, present chiefly in the [[Dominican Republic]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Cuba]], the [[Bahamas]], and [[France]]. They also live in other countries like [[Belgium]], [[Jamaica]], [[Turks and Caicos]], [[Mexico]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]],  [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]], among others.

In the United States alone, there are an estimated 975,000 people of Haitian ancestry, according to the 2010 Census; an estimated 500,000–800,000 Haitians live in the Dominican Republic&lt;ref&gt;F.

===Particulars===
[[Jean Baptiste Point du Sable]], an immigrant from [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day Haiti), founded the first nonindigenous settlement in what is now [[Chicago, Illinois]], the third largest city in the United States. The State of Illinois and City of Chicago declared du Sable the Founder of Chicago on October 26, 1968.

In January 2010, Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] announced that [[Canada]] will consider fast-tracking [[Immigration to Canada|immigration]] to help Haitian earthquake refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/01/15/haiti-canada-immigration.html Canada considers fast-tracking Haitian immigration], CBC News (January 15, 2010).

There is a significant Haitian population in [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]], specifically the [[Miami]] enclave of [[Little Haiti]]. [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] has many historic ties to Haiti that date back to the Haitian Revolution. [[New York City]], especially in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], [[East Flatbush]] and [[Springfield Gardens]], has a thriving émigré community with the second largest population of Haitians of any state in the nation. There are large and active Haitian communities in [[Boston]]; [[Spring Valley, New York|Spring Valley]] (New York); [[New Jersey]]; [[Washington D.C.]]; [[Providence, Rhode Island]]; [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]; [[Connecticut]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. There are also large Haitian communities in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada; [[Paris, France]]; [[Havana, Cuba]]; [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] and [[Kingston, Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Regine O.|title=Geographies of the Haitian Diaspora|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-88708-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anténor Firmin]] was a 19th-century Haitian [[anthropologist]], perhaps the first black anthropologist and an early writer of [[négritude]], who influenced 20th century American anthropologist [[Melville J. Herskovits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Fluehr-Lobban |first=Carolyn |year=2005 |title=Anténor Firmin and Haiti’s contribution to anthropology |journal=Gradhiva – musée du quai Branly |issue=2005 : Haïti et l'anthropologie |pages=95–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michaëlle Jean]], the former [[Governor General of Canada]] and now Secretary-General of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]], was a refugee from Haiti who came to Canada in 1968 at age 11.

Haitian immigrants have constituted a very visible segment of American and Canadian society, dating back to before [[Haitian Revolution|the independence of Haiti from France]] in 1804. Haiti's proximity to the United States, and its status as a free black republic in the years before the [[American Civil War]], have contributed to this relationship. Many influential early American settlers and black freemen, including [[Jean Baptiste Point du Sable]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], were of Haitian origin.

In modern times, large-scale emigration from Haiti is mostly because they have been steadily migrating in significant numbers to the United States since the late 1950s–early 1960s, soon after [[François Duvalier]] ("Papa Doc") became the strongman of Haiti. The political repression that characterized Duvalier's regime forced large numbers of Haitians to seek safer harbor in the United States. Sustained political oppression, economic hardship, and lack of opportunity continued to drive contingents of Haitian immigrants out of their homeland throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Zéphir 1996, 2001; Catanese 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present status in the United States===
Haitian immigration persists to the present day, as evidenced in the numerous reports of major news networks, such as those of [[CNN]] or the ''[[New York Times]]'', about the boat people disembarking on the Florida shores as recently as October 2002. The combination of push and pull factors led Haitians to cross the [[Caribbean Sea]], by plane or by boat, legally or illegally, in order to reach the shores of America, the perceived land of opportunity, to begin new lives. An examination of the records of the Census Bureau as well as those of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) allows for reasonable inferences about the size of the legal Haitian population currently residing in the United States. However, estimates provided by community leaders who offer assistance to the illegal population as well suggest that the actual number of the Haitian diaspora is higher than that recorded in government documents. In short, there is good reason to believe that the Haitian diaspora in the [[United States]] exceeds 850,000, and according to community leaders may be close to 1 million.

That the Haitian community in the U.S. is one of the fastest-growing ethnic groups is reflected in its political gains. Florida boasts two Haitian-American state lawmakers, and another recently served as secretary of health under former Gov. Jeb Bush, who actively courted the community's votes. In Chicago, [[Kwame Raoul]], the son of Haitian émigrés, now fills Sen. Barack Obama's former state Senate seat. [[Pierre-Richard Prosper]], the son of Haitian doctors, served as U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes after he was nominated by President Bush in January 2001. He ended his term in 2005.
Under heavy lobbying by the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus and some Republicans, Congress enacted the HOPE Act, and President Bush signed it. The act provides duty-free imports for some Haitian textiles. The Bush administration also spared Haiti some of the deep aid cuts that hit other Latin American nations.

The [[Congressional Black Caucus]] has urged more economic aid for Haiti and criticized the lack of U.S. support for former Haitian President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], ousted in 2004 amid a violent uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, J. (2004, March 7). Island offers a lesson for U.S. St. Louis Post-Dispatch, p. B1. Retrieved from http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Belfast News Letter.

===[[New York City]]===
New York City has the largest concentration of Haitians in the United States as well as the oldest established Haitian communities of the country. The conservative estimate of the documented Haitian population in the New York City Metropolitan Area, as recorded by INS is approximately 156,000. However, community leaders and directors of community centers, who come in constant contact with the undocumented population, strongly believe that the actual number is closer to 400,000. This number includes the non-immigrant (temporary visitors, students, temporary workers and trainees) and undocumented entrants, as well as the documented residents who do not fill out the census forms for a variety of reasons. Moreover, the New York City Haitian population represents a very heterogeneous group, reflecting the various strata of Haitian society. Members of the middle class started migrating during the U.S. occupation in the 1920s and 1930s; at the time they established their enclaves in [[Harlem]], where they mingled with African Americans and other Caribbean immigrants who were contributing to the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. Significant waves followed exponentially during the [[François Duvalier|Duvalier]] era that started in 1957 and ended in 1986 with the ousting of Baby Doc. These waves were more heterogeneous than previous ones, as no single class of Haitians was immune from the Duvaliers’ dictatorship. To date, cohorts of Haitians continue to come to New York, many being sent for by relatives already established in the city.
Haitians reside in all the boroughs.

====Brooklyn====
The largest communities are found in Brooklyn where the legal population is placed at approximately 88,763, and in Queens where the number of Haitians is believed to be around 40,000. Members of the community who are of working-class background tend to establish their residence in Brooklyn, primarily in the neighborhoods of [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]], [[East Flatbush, Brooklyn|East Flatbush]], and [[Canarsie, Brooklyn|Canarsie]]; many are apartment dwellers many homes in the area are duplexes and triplexes. Upper middle-class
Haitians who choose to stay in Brooklyn own brownstone homes in the [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] area and single family homes in the [[Midwood, Brooklyn|Midwood]] section.

====Queens====
Generally speaking, Haitians themselves consider the majority of their compatriots living in Queens to be mostly middle class.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Members of this group enjoy ownership of their homes or cooperative apartments in the neighborhoods of [[Cambria Heights, Queens|Cambria Heights]], [[Queens Village, Queens|Queens Village]], [[Springfield Gardens, Queens|Springfield Gardens]], and [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]]. Less privileged Haitians settle in the working-class neighborhoods of [[Rosedale, Queens|Rosedale]]; generally members of the professional community live in the more affluent section of [[Holliswood, Queens|Holliswood]], and some move to the adjacent counties of [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] which are parts of [[Long Island]].

====Manhattan====
In [[Manhattan]], a small concentration of working-class Haitians (7%) congregates on the [[Upper West Side]] and [[Harlem]]. Some reside along [[Cathedral Parkway]] and in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]]. Very few Haitians (less than 1%) establish their niches in the [[Bronx]].

====Metropolitan area====
In this discussion, it is also important to recall that Haitians have established communities in the neighboring counties of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] that are included in the [[Greater New York Metropolitan Statistical Area]] as well as in the city of [[Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]]. In fact, [[Spring Valley, New York|Spring Valley]] in Rockland County has a relatively large segment of Haitian residents, estimated at 23% of the population. In Westchester County the city of Mt. Vernon has a small but significant Haitian community.

====Visibility====
The number of Haitians in New York makes them a highly visible community. In neighborhoods with higher concentration of Haitians the community has managed to establish institutions and businesses such as community centers, churches, music shops, grocery stores, restaurants, bakeries, bars, beauty and barber shops, travel agencies, shipping companies, money transfer companies, and a hodgepodge of other enterprises. Those are found all along Flatbush, Church, and Nostrand Avenues, as well as along Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn; on Linden, Farmers and Francis Lewis Boulevards, and Jamaica and Hillside Avenues in Queens. They are easily recognizable since many display signs written both in English and [[Haitian Creole]] (sometimes in [[French language|French]]), such as Yoyo Fritaille, Le Manoir, Le Viconte, Haiti Parcel &amp; Cargo Inc., and Bakery Creole. On intensely hot days, passersby strolling along these avenues and boulevards have their nostrils filled with the aromas of fried meats and plantains, and their ears with rhythms of [[Sweet Micky]], [[Compas|Kompa]], [[Zin (band)|Zin]], [[T-Vice]], [[CaRiMi]], [[Tabou Combo]], and [[Boukman Eksperyans]], to name some of the most celebrated musical groups and bands. Animated conversations in Haitian Creole can be heard, as members of the community "hang out" in those shops and businesses to discuss home politics and news, exchange gossip, find out what goes on in the community, and keep alive their various traditions, be they culinary, intellectual, literary, or artistic. During the summer, some musicians perform a parading musical form called Rara in Central Park and Prospect Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rara in Haiti and its Diaspora|url=http://rara.wesleyan.edu/|publisher=Wesleyan University|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culturally relevant teaching===

According to the 2014–2015 English Language Learner Demographic Report published by the NYC Department of Education, 3,031 [[English-language learner|English Language Learners]] (ELLs) in K-12 schools in New York City speak [[Haitian Creole]], making it the sixth most common home language of ELLs citywide and the fifth most common home language of Brooklyn ELLs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/0183D51C-377B-4ED7-BCBE-607AE4669D54/0/201415ELLDemographicReport.pdf|title=English Language Learner Demographics Report: 2014-2015 School Year|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NYC Department of Education|access-date=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the large population of Haitian Creole-speaking students within NYC schools, various organizations have been established to respond to the needs of these students. For example, Flanbwayan and Gran Chimen Sant Kiltirèl, both located in Brooklyn, New York, aim to promote education and Haitian culture through advocacy, literacy projects, and cultural/artistic endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerat|first=Marie Lily|year=2011|title=Myths and Realities: A History of Haitian Creole Language Programs in New York City|url=|journal=Journal of Haitian Studies|volume=17|pages=73–91|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other educators have called for a culturally relevant pedagogy to better meet the needs of Haitian Creole-speaking ELLs. For instance, noting the intrinsic value of cultural background knowledge on reading comprehension, Kristen L. Oscarsson employed Haitian folktales with a group of 4th and 5th grade Haitian students in the U.S. as a method of improving their literacy rates. At the end of her 12-week study, most of her students' reading skills had increased at least one grade level, with some increasing two or two and a half grade levels.&lt;ref&gt;Oscarsson, Kristen L. ''Haitian Folktales as a Literacy Strategy for Elementary Haitian ESOL Students''. Master of Science Thesis, Nova University, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miami===
The documented Haitian-American population of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]], based on government records, is approximately 100,000. However, when one factors in the attested underrepresentation of the Census data, as well as the number of undocumented immigrants, there is good reason to believe that community leaders and technocrats who work with the Haitian community are not wrong to place Haitian population at over 200,000. A large contingent of Haitians may be living in Miami undocumented. Haitian people seeking political asylum and/or economic opportunity have been steadily arriving in [[Florida]] shores since the early 1970s.

====Little Haiti====
Haitians have established themselves in the Edison/Little River area of Miami, which eventually came to be referred to as Little Haiti. Once they are able, some end up moving out of Little Haiti to the neighboring municipality of North Miami, where a relatively large segment of Haitian immigrants of lower-middle-class background relocates. On the other hand, Miami is also experiencing another wave of Haitian immigration, this time coming from the Northeast United States ([[New York City]] and [[Boston]]), the Midwest ([[Chicago]]), and [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. This particular group of Haitians is composed mostly of middle-class individuals who relocate to Florida due to the weather and its proximity to Haiti. These newer residents often live in the middle-class neighborhoods such as  [[Miami Shores]], [[North Miami Beach]], [[El Portal, Florida|El Portal]], and [[Miami Gardens]].

Irrespective of the presence of middle-class Haitians, Miami is considered the city that received (and continues to receive) the largest segment of lower-class Haitians, consisting of poor peasants from andeyò (countryside) and urban dwellers. Many of these Haitians found new lives in the Edison/Little River section of Miami, one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city. Soon after, this area became known as Little Haiti, and is now one of the most recognizable Haitian communities in the United States. From north to south, Little Haiti extends from 84th Street to 36th Street; from west to east, it is ten blocks wide, stretching from 6th Ave, NW to 4th Ave, NE. It is crossed by two major north-south axes: Miami Avenue, and Second Avenue NE renamed Avenue Morrisseau-Leroy after the revered Haitian writer who championed the cause of (Haitian) Creole in literature, and who spent the later years of his life in Miami until his death in the late summer of 1998. The main thoroughfares that cross east/west are 36th, 54th, 62nd, and 79th Streets. Estimates of the population of Little Haiti vary from 40,000 to 55,000. Little Haiti is also considered one of the poorest areas of Miami-Dade County. The following figures were released by the Edison/Little River Neighborhood Planning Program (1994–96): The per capita income is $5,693, the median household income is $14,142, and close to half the population lives below poverty level. City government efforts are currently underway to revitalize the neighborhood, by creating long-term economic development, and improving housing and infrastructure. The City of Miami has established in Little Haiti a neighborhood service center (along with others throughout the metropolitan area), known as Neighborhood Enhancement Teams (NET) to address the social problems of the community.

====Delray Beach====
Delray Beach, Florida, has become the US town with the largest percentage Haitian population in the United States. More than just sheer numbers, the Haitian community also grew geographically, economically, and socially; extending itself while maintaining a relatively low profile in the community it has adopted as its own. This growth has paralleled the incredible economic turnaround of Delray Beach as a municipality. It represents the awakening of a community which for a long time has lived in the shadow of its larger neighbor in Miami. The impressive growth has also brought about some strains within the Haitian community and in the community’s interactions with the other residents of Delray Beach.

====Ethnic visibility====
Most of the Haitian businesses in Little Haiti are found along the major arterials mentioned above; like those of New York, they are unmistakably Haitian with names such as Bèl Fouchèt, Piman Bouk, Les Cousins, Libreri Mapou, and Cayard Market. They include restaurants, grocery stores, dry cleaning establishments, tailor and shoe repair shops, shipping and money transfer companies, botanicas (shops that sell mostly religious/spiritual objects, including Vodou artifacts), among others. Little Haiti is the heart of the Haitian community of Miami.

===Boston===
Boston has attracted significant numbers of immigrants from Haiti for over 40 years. This arrival over time of Haitians in Boston corresponded to several waves of migration that have come to the United States from the [[Caribbean]] country since the 1950s. The largest of these migratory waves in the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s flowed into the metropolitan New York area. Since the late 1970s, the largest destination has expanded to include South Florida.

Haitians have settled in sections within the Boston city limits and its surrounding area. The location and diffusion of the population has mirrored the growth of the community. Highly concentrated in the city at first, Boston’s Haitians slowly expanded to neighboring municipalities and, most recently, to far-flung suburbs. There are, for example, significant numbers of the population in [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]], [[Randolph, Massachusetts|Randolph]], and [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]]. The area of greatest Haitian concentration in Boston proper is in Mattapan, followed by [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], [[Hyde Park, Massachusetts|Hyde Park]] and [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]].

Blue Hill Avenue is an important Haitian thoroughfare. The street runs through Roxbury and Dorchester. Its last section, in [[Mattapan]], is Boston's Haitian ‘downtown.’ There, the street is dotted with several Haitian businesses. Many Haitian churches and organizations have their headquarters along Blue Hill Avenue also.

On the north bank of the [[Charles River]], Haitians settled in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] in the 1950s and 60s. The population in this area now numbers approximately 7,500. Although Haitians did not arrive in nearby [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] until the early 1990s, the community there today is almost as large as the one in Cambridge. Currently, however, increasing costs of living in Cambridge and Somerville are beginning to drive out people of modest means. The result has been the relocation of many of these area’s Haitians to the more affordable neighboring towns of [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]], [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], and [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]].

====Ethnic visibility====
In the mind of most Americans,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Boston is a city of politics, and politics in Boston is dominated by its [[Irish American|Irish]] population, particularly the legendary [[Kennedy family]]. In today’s city, however, where the traditionally powerful white population has recently become a minority, another immigrant group — Haitians — has found itself in a position to play an important role in building institutions, starting enterprises and building broad political coalitions with other groups.

The strong organizational basis of the community is evident from the broad array of public and private entities that serve it. To those who have followed the community’s evolution, it unsurprising that Haitians in Boston are beginning to develop themselves into an emerging, local political force. A variety of entrepreneurial activities established in the Haitian population have been highly successful in the Boston area. Activities focusing on food services (catering and restaurants), money transfer, tax preparation, and financial management are among the most common, attracting interest and sustaining success. These enterprises cater to the needs of any recently arrived and rapidly growing population. Haitian entrepreneurs have established businesses through the Boston metro region. Mattapan to Dorchester, on both sides of Blue Hill Avenue, they are in greatest profusion.

Many of the area’s earliest immigrants from Haiti were skilled professionals who went on to become locally prominent lawyers, doctors, and educators. In increasing numbers, Haitian immigrants are working in the region’s health care system, particularly as nurses. One community leader{{Who|date=November 2009}} suggests that a visit to any nursing home in the Boston area would uncover the fact that 75% of those working there are Haitian.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Other common areas of employment include office positions with the high-tech companies along [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]], as well as positions as teachers in elementary and high schools.

The Haitian community in Boston, now almost 50 years old, has adjusted to several waves of immigration, each bringing people with different socio-economic backgrounds, interests, and needs. Members of today’s community include a variety of generations and individuals that have had radically different life experiences, ranging from a 70-year-old man who arrived in the late 1950s to a 10-year-old, third generation child who has never been to Haiti. Finding the common ground among such diverse members of the population is one issue in the community as is another one, dictated at least in part by geography. As Haitians spread throughout the metropolitan area, they are becoming somewhat economically segmented, with the blue-collar, lower-middle-class population in places like Mattapan or Somerville confronting quite different issues and challenges than the more white-collar, upper-middle-class families in places like Randolph on the outer fringes of the metropolitan area.

===New Jersey===
New Jersey is also home to the fourth largest population of Haitians in the United States after Florida, New York and the Boston area. There are several areas of New Jersey which the communities of Haitians live. The largest is in North Jersey where the population is visible around the [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] cities of [[Irvington, New Jersey|Irvington]], [[Orange, New Jersey|Orange]], [[East Orange, New Jersey|East Orange]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] concentrated in the area of [[Vailsburg, Newark, New Jersey|Vailsburg]]. Other areas of North Jersey where a Haitian presence is visible are in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]], and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]]. There is also a growing population in the suburbs of Essex and Union County in [[West Orange, New Jersey|West Orange]], [[Maplewood, New Jersey|Maplewood]], [[Roselle, New Jersey|Roselle]] and [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union]]. Other growing populations of the Haitian community can be seen in Central and South Jersey specifically in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[Willingboro, New Jersey|Willingboro]] and the [[Pleasantville, New Jersey|Pleasantville]]/[[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] area.

====Ethnic visibility====
The visibility of Haitians living in New Jersey especially in North Jersey can be seen in the different businesses such as music shops, grocery stores, restaurants, bakeries, bars, beauty and barber shops, travel agencies, tax companies, shipping companies, money transfer companies, and a hodgepodge of other businesses, which display their allegiances to their native country. Those are found all along Main Street and Central Avenue in Orange and East Orange, along Springfield, Stuyvesant and Clinton Avenues in Irvington and along South Orange Avenue in Newark and East Orange. Haitian-American youth are especially visible at collegiate institutions, such as [[Rutgers University]], [[Kean University]] and [[Montclair State University]] where a very active Haitian student organization is present on campus.

===Philadelphia===
Next to the NYC/New Jersey/Connecticut/Massachusetts area, Philadelphia has also become home to a growing number of Haitians. Like many other groups, the lower cost of living in Philadelphia has attracted many immigrants who entered the US through New York. There are large numbers of Haitians in [[North Philadelphia]], [[Northeast Philadelphia|Northeast]], and some in other areas like [[Olney, Philadelphia|Olney]], East Mount Airy, Chestnut Hill, and [[West Philadelphia]]. The conservative number of Haitians in Philadelphia is 30,000.

===Chicago===
There are two elected Haitian-American official in the Chicago area, an alderman in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], a suburb that straddles the city’s north side where many Haitian immigrants have settled and state senator Kwame Raoul. Lionel Jean-Baptiste, an attorney in private practice, was elected alderman in Evanston on April 3, 2001 becoming the first Haitian-American in the state to hold public office. Of the 8,000 residents in his ward, only about a hundred are Haitian and only about 30 of them registered voters, but that hasn’t stopped Haitians throughout the region from claiming him as their own. Eighty percent of the financing for his campaign came from Haitian donors. Still, the community has had difficulty asserting itself.

Indeed, Illinois’ Haitian population of about 15,000 is much smaller than that of Haitian communities on the East Coast. There are about half a million Haitians in the [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]] region, about 250,000 in Florida and about 70,000 in Massachusetts{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. Unlike those states, Illinois’ Haitian community is widely dispersed, with small enclaves of Haitian professionals, middle and working-class people and poor, undocumented refugees scattered in small clusters in and around Chicago. There is not a Little Haiti neighborhood here, like in Miami, to act as a voting block.

===Atlanta===
Presently{{when|date=January 2018}}, there is already a sizable Haitian community in Atlanta. And it is, indeed, growing at a rapid pace. Unlike most other Haitian-American centers, though, Atlanta does not have a central neighborhood where it is located. The community, like the city, is spread out considerably over a large area. To a certain extent this diffusion of the Haitian population has been a hindrance to the community’s ability to organize itself. At this moment, however, the tide seems to be turning, as a number of issues are galvanizing the community and bringing it closer together. Changes in the migration flows of Haitians to Atlanta, awareness of national-scale Haitian-American issues and the  bicentennial of Haiti’s independence in 2004, were all factors contributing toward the solidification of Atlanta’s spread out Haitian population.

====Ethnic visibility====
The Haitian community is spread out over the large, greater metropolitan area of Atlanta. Because there is no single area within the metropolitan vastness where Haitians have settled, there is no specific Haitian commercial area. Haitians live, work and shop throughout the greater Atlanta area which now includes the surrounding [[Gwinnett County|Gwinnett]], [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]], [[Douglas, Georgia|Douglas]], [[DeKalb County, Georgia|Dekalb]], and [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton]] counties. Within those counties, they live, work, and shop in such towns as [[Lawrenceville, Georgia|Lawrenceville]], [[Smyrna, Georgia|Smyrna]], [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]], [[Stone Mountain, Georgia|Stone Mountain]] and [[Austell]]. One of the areas of Haitian businesses within this great urban sprawl is on Moreland Avenue in Atlanta proper, where two Haitian-owned businesses face each other in a small shopping center. A number of Haitian businesses are located in Marietta, but not within a close range of each other. In addition, many new Haitians from the Northeast and Florida are relocating to the middle-class area of Gwinnett County in Lawrenceville. This area has established itself as the center of Haitian economic development in the Atlanta metropolitan area with a family friendly culture and atmosphere with great schools, parks, and shops.

===Detroit===
Haitians in the Detroit area are not located in any single neighborhood or part of the city. The greatest concentration of Haitian families, however, is in Northwest Detroit, within an area bounded by [[Telegraph Road (Michigan)|Telegraph Road]], the [[Southfield Freeway]], 5 Mile Road and [[8 Mile Road]]. Located within this general area is St. Gerard’s, one of two [[Roman Catholic]] churches attended by Detroit’s Haitians. Sacred Heart, the other, is located closer to downtown Detroit. Also not far from downtown, on Ferry Street in Detroit’s museum district near [[Wayne State University]], is another key institution of the Haitian community, the Espoir Center for Caribbean Arts and Culture.

===Washington, D.C.===
Haitians in the metropolitan Washington area are found in the city and in outlying areas in [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]]. Although Washington’s Haitians are scattered within the region, the single location with the heaviest concentration of Haitian-Americans is the suburban area of [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], [[Langley Park, Maryland|Langley Park]] and [[Hyattsville, Maryland]], home of the future ISU president Sebi. As evidence of this fact, not only are such Haitian institutions as Yon-Yon’s catering business, but also one can occasional hear spoken Creole in shops and stores in this part of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] and in nearby [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]].

===Deaths===
{{See also|2009 Turks and Caicos Islands migrant shipwreck}}
In the spring of 2007 a [[sloop]] overcrowded with at least 160 passengers left 82 dead. Some of the deceased were eaten by sharks say the survivors. In May 2009, similarly, nine Haitian migrants were killed when a boat loaded with approximately 30 passengers capsized.&lt;ref name="tyson"/&gt; 124 Haitian migrants were repatriated to Haiti after attempting to reach the United States. The U.S. coast guard reported that a {{convert|60|m|ft|sp=us}} boat was intercepted at the end of July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Canada===

{{main|Haitian Canadian}}
In the 1950s, the Haitian population in Canada only numbered in the forties. The emigration of Haitians in more substantial numbers began with the bloody dictatorship of Francois Duvalier in the early 1960s. With most Haitians being able to speak [[French language|French]], Canada is a natural destination as French is one Canada's two official languages alongside English. The Haitian diaspora, including all emigrants and their immediate descendants, is estimated to number close to 213,000.

Many chose Canada as their new home, specifically [[Quebec]], for linguistic and religious reasons. In coming to Canada, professional Haitians often had to bypass a Duvalier law forbidding them to leave Haiti. They frequently were forced to flee Haiti with false documents and with no legal proof of identity. Upon arrival in Canada they would declare their status as political refugees. The trend of French-speaking Haitian immigrants to Canada was to settle in Quebec—95% of them. By 1965, some 2,000 Haitians had arrived. The period covering the late 1960 through the 1970s saw a dramatic change in both the volume and background of Haitian immigrants. This was the beginning of the massive exodus in response to the Duvalier regime.

Haitians were drawn to Canada because of its tolerant immigration laws – foreign visitors, arriving with only a tourist visas, could later apply for landed immigrant status while in Canada. Canada also held an [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]-like quality for the Haitians, an image painted by friends already in Quebec who sent reports home that employment was abundant and well-paid. From 1973 to 1976 an average of approximately 3,000 Haitians were admitted to Canada each year, with a peak of 4,750 in 1974. The settlement of Haitians in Canada by the end of the exodus was estimated to have reached 45,070, according to Citizenship and Immigration Canada.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} 75 000 people born in Haiti arrived in Quebec between the years of 1961 and 2006 according to the community organization Maison d'Haïti based in [[Montreal]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Michaëlle Jean]], the former [[Governor General of Canada]], is a Haitian immigrant who came to Canada with her family at the age of 11.

===[[Montreal]]===
The early Haitian immigrants, those who came between 1960 and 1970, were usually from the Haitian elite. They came from a comfortable life in terms of their social and professional status. Most were doctors, academics, teachers and pursued careers in the liberal professions. In 1965, Canada welcomed 38 Haitians in these fields. In 1966, the number increased to 42. Almost no Haitians of the working class emigrated over the same period.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The Haitians of professional backgrounds received warm welcome in their new home. Their expertise was needed and they found work right away. Most had a level of education that was higher than that of the average Québécois. At the time, the medical, educational and civil service sectors of Quebec society were expanding. Haitians were in demand and filled a gap in the labour force.

===Ottawa, Ontario===
There are an estimated 20,000 persons of Haitian descent in the National Capital Region (including Ottawa and Gatineau). This smaller community of Haitian-Canadians tends to be more bilingual than their Quebec cousins. There was a Haitian-Canadian city councillor in Gatineau, QC: Mireille Apollon. She retired in 2018 after being elected twice. There is an annual Haitian music and culture festival, called ''Festival Haïti en fête'', in the East-Ottawa suburb of Orléans, where a significant number of Haitian-Canadian families live.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Brazil==
The year 2010 marked the beginning of Haitian immigration in Brazil. The arrival of the Haitians via Tabatinga, in the Amazon, began to be noticed in February 2010, soon after the earthquake, that shook violently Haiti, and in particular the capital, Port-au-Prince. The catastrophe has killed more than 150,000 people and left some 300,000 IDPs.

The presence of Haitians in Brazil was quantitatively inexpressive until then. According to IBGE data, in 1940, 16 Haitians lived in Brazil; in 1950-21; in 1960-159; in 1970-90; in 1980-127; in 1991-1981; in 2000-15; and in 2010 - 36 people.

With the presence in Haiti of the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of Haiti - MINUSTAH, led by Brazil since 2004, Haitians have come to see Brazil as a point of reference. After the earthquake of 2010, which triggered a great wave of emigration in Haiti, Brazil became one of the preferential destinations of migrants, given the difficulty of entry into countries of traditional emigration (United States, Canada, Dominican Republic, France, etc.). Currently, around 50 to 100 Haitians enter the country undocumented by the state of Acre.

In 2015 and 2016, due to the political-economic crisis faced by Brazil, many Haitians are returning to Haiti, or going to other countries, such as Chile, Peru and the United States.

According to the government of Acre, since December 2010, about 130,000 Haitians have entered the Peruvian border with the state. According to the delegate Carlos Frederico Portella Santos Ribeiro, of the Federal Police (PF), between January and September 2011, there were 6 thousand and, in 2012, 2,318 Haitians who entered without documents in Brazil.

Haitians arrive in Brasiléia, Acre, by bus and are asked to look for the PF police station requesting refuge, filling out a questionnaire in their own language and being interviewed by police officers. The PF issues a preliminary protocol that makes them "asylum seekers", obtaining the same rights as Brazilian citizens, such as access to health and education. They can also get a work permit, passport and CPF, and are officially registered in the country.

After registration in the PF, the documentation goes to the National Committee for Refugees (Conare) and the National Immigration Council (Cnig), which open a process to evaluate the granting of permanent residence on a humanitarian basis, valid for up to 5 years. Haitians are not considered refugees in Brazil. Under Brazilian law, the refuge can only be granted to anyone who proves to be suffering persecution in their country for ethnic, religious or political reasons. However, due to the humanitarian crisis provoked by the catastrophe of 2010, the Brazilian government opened an exception, granting them a distinct visa.

In April 2013, the government of Acre decreed a social emergency in the municipalities of Epitaciolândia and Brasileia as a consequence of the arrival of undocumented immigrants in these places, mostly Haitians. For months, an emergency shelter for immigrants worked in Brasileia. In April 2014, due to the flooding of the Madeira River, this already overcrowded shelter had to be closed, leaving not only Haitians but also migrants from other countries, such as Senegal, Nigeria, the Dominican Republic and Bangladesh.

The undocumented situation of immigrants is largely a consequence of bureaucratic demands imposed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the entry of foreigners into the country. Besides Haitians, migrants from other countries began to use the border between Assis Brasil and the Peruvian city of Iñapari as the gateway to Brazil.

As a result of the closure of the Brasileia shelter, the Acre government moved the immigrants to Rio Branco for a new makeshift shelter.

Since April 8 and 9, 2014, the massive arrival of Haitians to the city of São Paulo without warning, on buses chartered by the government of Acre, has attracted the attention of the press, civil society and various humanitarian organizations. Upon arriving in the city of São Paulo, many of them seek the Peace Mission, an NGO linked to the Pastoral Care of Migrants.

Founded by Scalabrinian religious, the Peace Mission operates in the parish of Our Lady of Peace, in the neighborhood of Glicério. Since 1939 in activity, the Mission receives 110 immigrants daily and from 60 to 70 nationalities per year.  650 Haitians went through the Peace Mission between April 7 and May 11, 2014. The organization serves migrants (internal and external) and refugees from around the world since its foundation in 1939.

Father Paolo Parise, coordinator of the Mission, emphasizes the need for Brazil to have a clear humanist migration law, replacing Law 6,815, dated August 19, 1980 (Alien Statute), a "legacy of time of dictatorship ". According to him, the country lacks a de facto migration policy, and the State - not civil society organizations - should be the protagonist in actions in favor of migrants.

Haitians leave their country and their families mainly in search of work. "We do not believe that there are opportunities on the island, in Brazil everything is easier and it is the only place that is receiving the Haitians with humanity, in other countries it is a hell. "says Kenny Michaud, who has been in São Paulo for five months. In general, immigrants work to maintain themselves and also need to send money to their families in Haiti.

In 2012, Haitian emigrants sent their relatives the equivalent of 22 percent of Haiti's gross domestic product (GDP), according to CIA data. Before the earthquake of 2010, which destroyed the country's infrastructure and provoked the wave of emigration, the impact of remittances on GDP did not reach 16%. According to the World Bank, the value of international remittances to Haiti reached US $ 1.82 billion in 2012 (before the earthquake, it was less than US $ 1.3 billion). The Central Bank of Brazil says it does not have information on the amount remitted by individuals or legal entities there since 2010, but Haitians working in Brazil say they send an average of R $ 500 a month to family members

==Cuba==
{{Main|Haitian Cuban}}
Haitian Creole and culture first entered Cuba with the arrival of Haitian immigrants at the start of the 19th century. Haiti was a French colony, and the final years of the 1791–1804 Haitian Revolution brought a wave of French settlers and their Haitian slaves to Cuba. They came mainly to the east, and especially Guantanamo, where the French later introduced sugar cultivation, constructed sugar refineries and developed coffee plantations. By 1804, some 30,000 French were living in Baracoa and Maisí, the furthest eastern municipalities of the province. Later, Haitians continued to come to Cuba to work as braceros (hand workers, from the Spanish word brazo, meaning "arm") in the fields cutting cane. Their living and working conditions were not much better than slavery. Although they planned to return to Haiti, most stayed on in Cuba. For years, many Haitians and their descendants in Cuba did not identify themselves as such or speak Creole. In the eastern part of the island, many Haitians suffered discrimination. But according to the Castro regime, since 1959, when he took over, this discrimination has stopped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrocubaweb.com/haiticuba.htm "Haiti in Cuba", ''AfroCubanWeb'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Haitian Creole is the second most spoken language in [[Cuba]], where over 300,000 [[Afro-Cuban#Haitian Creole among Afro-Cubans|Haitian immigrants]] speak it. It is recognized as a language in Cuba and a considerable number of Cubans speak it fluently. Most of these speakers have never been to Haiti and do not possess Haitian ancestry, but merely learned it in their communities.   In addition to the eastern provinces, there are also communities in Ciego de Ávila and Camagüey provinces where the population still maintains Creole, their mother tongue. Classes in Creole are offered in Guantanamo, Matanzas and the City of Havana. In addition, there is a Haitian Creole radio station operating in [[Havana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrocubaweb.com/haiticuba.htm Haiti in Cuba]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huaca de la Luna''' ("[[Temple]]/[[Shrine]] of the [[Moon]]") is a large [[adobe]] [[brick]] structure built mainly by the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of northern [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benson, E.P.  |author2=Cook, A.G.|title=Ritual sacrifice in ancient Peru|year=2001|publisher=University of Texas Press|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[Huaca del Sol]], the Huaca de la Luna is part of ''Huacas de Moche'', which is the remains of an ancient Moche [[Capital (political)|capital city]] called Cerro Blanco, by the volcanic peak of the same name.

==Background==
The Huacas de Moche site is located 4&amp;nbsp;km outside the modern city of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], near the mouth of the [[Moche River]] valley. The Huaca de la Luna, though it is the smaller of the two [[huaca]]s at the site, has yielded the most archaeological information. The Huaca del Sol was partially destroyed and looted by Spanish [[conquistador]]s in the 17th century, while the Huaca de la Luna was left relatively untouched. Archeologists believe that the Huaca del Sol may have served for administrative, military, and residential functions, as well as a burial mound for the Moche elite. The Huaca de la Luna served primarily a ceremonial and religious function, though it contains burials as well.

Today the Huaca de la Luna is colored the soft brown of its adobe brickwork. At the time of construction, it was decorated in registers of murals which were painted in black, bright red, sky blue, white, and yellow. The sun and weather has since utterly faded these murals away. Inside the Huaca are other murals created in earlier phases of construction. Many of these depict a deity now known as [[Ayapec]]. ''Ayapec'' is a [[Muchik]] word translating as ''all knowing''. "Wrinkle-Face" is the name given to another deity by the later [[Inca]] because of the deity's appearance.

Many of the later bricks used in the structure bear one of over 100 different markings, perhaps corresponding to groups of laborers from different communities. Each "team" was maybe assigned a mark to put on their bricks, and these were used to count the number of bricks laid for financial as well as (presumably) competitive purposes.

The Huaca de la Luna is a large complex of three main platforms, each one serving a different function. The northernmost platform, at one time brightly decorated with a variety of murals and reliefs, was destroyed by looters. The surviving central and southern platforms have been the focus of most excavations. The central platform has yielded multiple high-status burials interred with a variety of fine ceramics, suggesting that it was used as a burial ground for the Moche religious elite. The grave goods found at the Huaca del Sol suggest it may have been used for the interment of political rulers.

The eastern platform, black rock and adjacent patios were the sites of human sacrifice rituals. These are depicted in a variety of Moche visual arts, most notably painted ceramics. After the sacrifice, bodies of victims would be hurled over the side of the Huaca and left exposed in the patios. Researchers have discovered multiple skeletons of adult males at the foot of the rock, all of whom show signs of trauma, usually a severe blow to the head, as the cause of death.

The [[World Monuments Fund]] has been working at Huaca de la Luna to support needed conservation work. This includes ongoing assessments, documentation, stabilization, and consolidation of excavated architectural and decorative elements.

Bocheński.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldcat.org/identities/leen-n50-9237/ J.M. Bocheński WorldCat Identities]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is particularly noted for his authoritative commentary on the [[Kritik der Reinen Vernunft]] of [[Immanuel Kant]] as well as the commentary he and Nicholl supplied in their translation of Baumgarten’s "Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus" introducing that work.  Except for his sabbaticals, Aschenbrenner resided in [[Berkeley, California]] from 1943 to 1986 and in [[Los Angeles]] from 1986 to 1988. During sabbatical leaves Aschenbrenner taught at the [[Universität Wien]], [[University College London]] and the [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München]]. He remained [[Professor Emeritus]] at the University of California at Berkeley until his death in 1988. Aschenbrenner died in Budapest while doing research and is buried in [[Farkasréti Cemetery]] in that city. The Aschenbrenner papers are held by the [[Doe Library]] of the University of California at Berkeley.

==Career==
According to the notice posted at "In Memoriam", a site maintained by the Academic Senate of the University of California,&lt;ref&gt;[http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb967nb5k3;doc.view=content&amp;chunk.id=div00004 Karl Aschenbrenner "In Memoriam" Tribute]&lt;/ref&gt; Aschenbrenner was descended from [[Volga Germans]] immigrants to Kansas.  Aschenbrenner was born November 20, 1911 in Bison, Rush County in that state. His upbringing was in [[Portland, Oregon]]. He obtained his undergraduate education at [[Reed College]] (1934). He was awarded his M.A. (1938) and Ph.D. degrees (1940) at Berkeley. He served an Instructor at Reed College for two years, then as a meteorologist Lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve from 1943 to 1946. He served as a flight instructor at [[Saint Mary's College of California|St. Mary’s College]] in Moraga, California (1942-1946) after which he joined the faculty of the Speech Department at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1948 he obtained his appointment as Assistant Professor in the Philosophy Department.  "His teaching was mainly in aesthetics and the history of philosophy, notably the Kant course," according to the "In Memoriam" notice. His principal instructor was [[Jacob Loewenberg]], the leading Kantian at Berkeley and department chair (1935-1941) while Aschenbrenner was studying for his doctorate. Aschenbrenner was active in founding the [[Journal of the History of Philosophy]], on whose board of directors he served for 27 years. He was the recipient of Guggenheim, Fulbright, and NEH fellowships. 
Aschenbrenner undertook the study of [[Hungarian language|Magyar]], the Hungarian language, in order to test his theories in the context of a language which was not [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] spoken by people of European culture. His article ''The Appraisive Function of Hungarian Verbs  in -kodik, -kedik and –ködik'' (cited below) is based on his researches. The "In Memoriam" notice remarks: "Whereas Indo-European languages express appraisals almost entirely by the use of special vocabularies, Magyar possesses verb endings that contribute a crediting or pejorative sense to the resulting compound. Thus Magyar speakers think of some evaluative notions as modalities of descriptive concepts rather than as a distinct family." 
Aschenbrenner served as department head on two occasions at Berkeley, first as the chairman of the Department of Philosophy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucb/departments_p.html#philosophy Department of Philosophy, University of California, Berkeley]&lt;/ref&gt; at Dwinelle Hall (1957-1962) and later as the chairman of the Department of Design&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucb/departments_d.html Department of Design, University of California, Berkeley]&lt;/ref&gt; at Wurster Hall (1964-1965); his service in the latter capacity has been documented in the Centennial Record,&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb4v19n9zb/ Centennial Record]&lt;/ref&gt; maintained by Calisphere, a service of the libraries of the University of California.

==Publications==

[[George Boas]], in a review published in 1955 in Modern Language Notes remarks, regarding the Aschenbrenner-Holther translation of Baumgarten’s ''Reflections on Poetry'': "The editors, whose introduction is in many ways admirable, particularly in that it makes a reading of Baumgarten's own work superfluous." &lt;ref&gt;Vol. 70, No. 8 at 617-618.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Irving Singer]], in a review published in 1955 in The Philosophical Review commented on the same work. "Mssrs. Aschenbrenner and Holther are to be commended for making available a work which has been neglected for many years."&lt;ref&gt;Vol. 64, No. 1, at 154-155.&lt;/ref&gt;
Receiving favourable notice at the time of publication, with reviews in German, Dutch and Spanish journals, were Aschenbrenner’s three major works in the field of analytic philosophy which should be treated as a precursor to today’s computer-aided [[content analysis]]. These were ''Concepts of Value'', (1971) ''Concepts of Criticism'' (1974) and ''Analysis of Appraisive Characterization'' (1983).  Aschenbrenner’s death was noted by J. Maeyaert in the Journal for Philosophy (Dutch: Tijdschrift voor Filosofie): "His teaching was especially devoted to the aesthetics and the history of philosophy." &lt;ref&gt;"Zijn onderricht was vooral gewijd aan de esthetica en de geschiedenis van de wijsbegeerte." 51ste Jaarg., Nr. 3, September 1989, at 576-596.  The Tjidschrift is affiliated with the Catholic University of Louvain (Katholieke Universiteit-Leuven).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Antonio Cua]] in Philosophy East and West referred readers to Concepts of Value: "For an illuminating discussion of appraisive creativity in general." &lt;ref&gt;Philosophy East and West, Vol. 25, No. 1, The Problems of Causation: East and West (Jan., 1975) at 1-10.  The journal is affiliated with the University of Hawai’i.&lt;/ref&gt; Aschenbrenner’s works appear in 113 publications and are held in the collections of 2,371 library holdings according to [[WorldCat]] Identities page; link below.   Excluding translations of previously published works, Aschenbrenner’s works appear in English (48), Polish (3), German (2), French (2), Spanish, Italian, Modern Greek and Romanian (1 each). Aschenbrenner’s papers have been deposited in the Doe Library at the University of California at Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.oac.cdlib.org/pdf/berkeley/bancroft/m2005_167_cubane.pdf  Karl Aschenbrenner papers, 1917-1984] BANC MSS 85/83 c; retrieved July 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|1965 Immigration Act]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the second most common language in the country. The United States does not have an official language, but 32 state governments out of 50 have declared English to be one, or the only, official language. The government of [[Louisiana]] offers services and most documents in both English and [[French language|French]], as does [[New Mexico]] in English and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The government of [[Puerto Rico]], a U.S. territory, operates almost entirely in Spanish, even though its official languages are Spanish and English. There are many languages indigenous to [[Indigenous languages of the Americas#North America|North America]] or to U.S. states or holdings in the Pacific region. [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], although having few native speakers, is an official language along with English of the state of [[Hawaii]]. [[Alaska]] officializes English and [[Alaska Native languages|twenty native languages]].

While modern estimates indicate that [[American Sign Language]] was signed by as many as 500,000 Americans, as of 1972—the last official survey, closer estimates range around 100,000 as of 2011. (Although various cultural factors, such as passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], have resulted in far greater educational opportunities for deaf children, which could double or triple the number of current ASL users.)

==Official language status==
There is no official language at the U.S. federal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/20/us/english-us-official-language-trnd/index.html|title=FYI: English isn't the official language of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 32 states of the United States, in some cases as part of what has been called the [[English-only movement]], have adopted legislation granting official status to English. Out of 50 states, 30 have established English as the only official language, while Hawaii recognizes both English and Hawaiian as official, and Alaska has made some 20 native languages official, along with English. 

Moreover, English is one of the official languages in all of the U.S. territories. In [[Puerto Rico]] both English and Spanish are official, although Spanish has been declared the principal official language. The school system and the government operate almost entirely in Spanish. [[Guam]] recognizes English and Chamorro. In the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], English is the only official language. In [[American Samoa]], both English and Samoan are officially recognized. In the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], English, Chamorro, and Carolinian are official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishfirst.org/d/states|title=States|publisher=Englishfirst.org|accessdate=February 5, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216195644/http://englishfirst.org/d/states|archivedate=February 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usenglish.org/u-s-english-efforts-lead-west-virginia-to-become-32nd-state-to-recognize-english-as-official-language |title=U.S. English Efforts Lead West Virginia to Become 32nd State to Recognize English as Official Language |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110160727/https://www.usenglish.org/u-s-english-efforts-lead-west-virginia-to-become-32nd-state-to-recognize-english-as-official-language/ |archivedate=January 10, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/24/alaskas-indigenous-languages-official "Alaska's indigenous languages attain official status"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212093511/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/24/alaskas-indigenous-languages-official |date=February 12, 2017 }}, Reuters.com, October 24, 2014.

English is the primary language used for legislation, regulations, executive orders, treaties, federal court rulings, and all other official pronouncements. Nonetheless, laws require documents such as ballots to be printed in multiple languages when there are large numbers of non-English speakers in an area. American schools, public as well as private, require English classes at every grade level, even in bilingual or dual-language learning situations.{{Citation needed|reason=is this true for private schools in all 50 states?|date=August 2018}} Semesters of English composition are compulsory in virtually all U.S. colleges and universities to satisfy requirements for associate's and bachelor's degrees.{{Citation needed|reason=to begin with not all colleges are on the semester system and not all have classes specifically for English composition though all schools almost certainly have classes requiring extensive writing in English.|date=August 2018}}

Throughout the [[Southwestern United States]], long-established Spanish-speaking communities coexist with large numbers of more recent [[Hispanophone]] immigrants. Although many new Latin American immigrants are less than fluent in English, nearly all second-generation [[Hispanic Americans]] speak English fluently, while only about half still speak Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/644/english-language-usage-hispanics|title=English Usage Among Hispanics in the United States|date=November 29, 2007|work=Pew Research Center's Hispanic Trends Project|accessdate=January 18, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215031706/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/644/english-language-usage-hispanics|archivedate=December 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages brought to the country by colonists or immigrants from Europe, Asia, or other parts of the world make up a large portion of the languages currently used; several languages, including creoles and sign languages, have also developed in the United States. Approximately 430 languages are spoken or signed by the population, of which 176 are indigenous to the area. Fifty-two languages formerly spoken in the country's territory are now [[Language death|extinct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grimes|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[2000 U.S. Census]], people of [[German American|German ancestry]] make up the largest single ethnic group in the United States, and the [[German language]] ranks fifth.&lt;ref name=ancestry2000&gt;{{Citation|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U |title=Ancestry: 2000 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |year=2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805183103/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U |archivedate=August 5, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=language2000&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[French language|French]] are still widely spoken among populations descending from immigrants from those countries in the early 20th century, but the use of these languages is dwindling as the older generations die. [[Russian language|Russian]] is also spoken by immigrant populations.

Tagalog and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] have over one million speakers each in the United States, almost entirely within recent immigrant populations. Both languages, along with the [[varieties of Chinese]] (mostly [[Cantonese]], [[Taishanese]], and [[Standard Mandarin]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]], are now used in elections in [[Alaska]], [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Texas]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name=AsianLang&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eac.gov/News/press/eac-issues-glossaries-of-election-terms-in-five-asian-languages/ |title=EAC Issues Glossaries of Election Terms in Five Asian Languages Translations to Make Voting More Accessible to a Majority of Asian American Citizens |publisher=Election Assistance Commission |date=June 20, 2008 |accessdate=January 18, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731133121/http://www.eac.gov/News/press/eac-issues-glossaries-of-election-terms-in-five-asian-languages/ |archivedate=July 31, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native American languages are spoken in smaller pockets of the country, but these populations are decreasing, and the languages are almost never widely used outside of reservations. Besides English, Spanish, French, German, [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and other Native American languages, all other languages are usually learned from immigrant ancestors that came after the time of independence or learned through some form of [[education]].

[[American Sign Language]] is the most common [[sign language]] in the United States although there are unrelated sign languages which have been developed in the States and its territories—mostly in the Pacific. No concrete numbers exist for signers but something upwards of 250,000 is common.

California has agreed to allow the publication of state documents in other languages to represent minority groups and immigrant communities. Languages such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], Tagalog, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and [[Thai language|Thai]] appear in official state documents, and the Department of Motor Vehicles publishes in nine languages.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Motor Vehicles Website (actual website blocked by Wikipedia)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Mexico]], although the state constitution does not specify an official language, laws are published in English and Spanish, and government materials and services are legally required (by Act) to be made accessible to speakers of both languages as well as [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and various [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo]] languages. New Mexico also has [[New Mexican Spanish|its own dialect of Spanish]], which differs from Spanish spoken in the rest of [[Latin America]].

[[Native American languages]] are official or co-official on many of the U.S. [[Indian reservation]]s and [[pueblo]]s. In [[Oklahoma]] before statehood in 1907, territory officials debated whether or not to have [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]], [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]], and [[Creek language|Muscogee]] languages as co-official, but the idea never gained ground. [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] is officially recognized by the [[Cherokee Nation]] within the Cherokee tribal jurisdiction area in eastern Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James W. Parins|title=Literacy and Intellectual Life in the Cherokee Nation, 1820–1906|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dab8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA248|date=November 4, 2013|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-5122-9|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After [[New Amsterdam]] (formerly a [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colony]]) was transferred to English administration (becoming the [[Province of New York]]) in the late 17th century, English supplanted [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as the official language. However, "Dutch remained the primary language for many civil and ecclesiastical functions and most private affairs for the next century."&lt;ref&gt;David W.

Hans Krabbendam, Cornelis A. van Minnen &amp; Giles Scott-Smith: [[SUNY Press]], 2009), pp. 132-33.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jersey Dutch]] dialect is now extinct.

The issue of [[multilingualism]] also applies in the states of [[Arizona]] and [[Texas]]. While the constitution of Texas has no official language policy, Arizona passed a proposition [[United States general elections, 2006|in 2006]] declaring English as the official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A popular [[urban legend]] called the [[Muhlenberg legend]] claims that German was almost made an official language of the United States but lost by one vote.

==Indigenous languages==

===Native American languages===
[[Native American languages]] predate European settlement of the [[New World]]. In a few parts of the U.S. (mostly on [[Indian reservation]]s), they continue to be spoken fluently. Most of these languages are [[Endangered languages|endangered]], although there are efforts to revive them. Normally the fewer the speakers of a language the greater the degree of endangerment, but there are many small Native American language communities in the Southwest ([[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]]) which continue to thrive despite their small size.
In 1929, speaking of indigenous [[Native American languages]], linguist [[Edward Sapir]] observed:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

According to the 2000 Census and other language surveys, the largest Native American language-speaking community by far is the Navajo. [[Navajo language|Navajo]] is an [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] language of the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dené family]], with 178,000 speakers, primarily in the states of [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Utah]]. Altogether, Navajo speakers make up more than 50% of all Native American language speakers in the United States. [[Western Apache]], with 12,500 speakers, also mostly in Arizona, is closely related to Navajo but not mutually intelligible with it. Navajo and other Athabaskan languages in the Southwest are relative outliers; most other Athabascan languages are spoken in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Alaska]].

[[Dakota language|Dakota]] is a [[Siouan languages|Siouan language]] with 18,000 speakers in the US alone (22,000 including speakers in Canada), not counting 6,000 speakers of the closely related [[Lakota language|Lakota]]. Most speakers live in the states of [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]]. Other Siouan languages include the closely related [[Winnebago language|Winnebago]], and the more distant [[Crow language|Crow]], among others.

[[Yupik languages|Central Alaskan Yup'ik]] is an [[Eskimo-Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut language]] with 16,000 speakers, most of whom live in Alaska. The term "Yupik" is applied to its relatives, which are not necessarily mutually intelligible with Central Alaskan, including [[Naukan Yupik language|Naukan]] and [[Central Siberian Yupik language|Central Siberian]], among others.

[[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] belongs to the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian family]] and has about 22,000 speakers as of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncmuseumofhistory.org/collateral/articles/f05.cherokee.language.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Look at the Cherokee Language |publisher=North Carolina Museum of History, from Tar Heel Junior Historian 45:1 (fall 2005) |accessdate=January 18, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124062620/http://www.ncmuseumofhistory.org/collateral/articles/F05.Cherokee.language.pdf |archivedate=January 24, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cherokee have the largest tribal affiliation in the U.S., but most are of mixed ancestry and do not speak the language. Recent efforts to preserve and increase the Cherokee language in the [[Cherokee Nation]] and the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians|United Keetoowah Band]] in [[Oklahoma]], and among the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians|Eastern Band]] in [[North Carolina]], have been productive. More than 1,000 people each also speak the related languages of [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]] and [[Seneca language|Seneca]].

The [[O'odham language]], spoken by the [[Pima people|Pima]] and the [[Tohono O'odham]], is a [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language]] with more than 12,000 speakers, most of whom live in central and southern [[Arizona]] and northern [[Sonora]]. Other Uto-Aztecan languages include [[Hopi language|Hopi]], [[Shoshoni language|Shoshone]], and the [[Colorado River Numic language|Pai-Ute]] languages.

[[Choctaw language|Choctaw]] has 11,000 speakers. Choctaw is part of the [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean family]], like [[Muscogee language|Seminole]] and [[Alabama language|Alabama]].

The [[Algic languages|Algonquian language family]] includes languages like [[Ojibwe language|Chippewa/Ojibwe]], [[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]], and [[Cree language|Cree]].

[[Keresan languages|Keres]] has 11,000 speakers in New Mexico. A [[language isolate]], the Keres are the largest of the Pueblo nations. The Keres pueblo of [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]] is the oldest continually inhabited community in the United States. [[Zuni language|Zuni]], another isolate, has around 10,000 speakers, most of whom reside within the [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico|Zuni pueblo]].

Although the languages of the Americas have a history stretching back about 17,000 to 12,000 years, current knowledge of them is limited. There are doubtless a number of undocumented languages that were once spoken in the United States that are missing from historical record.

Below is an estimate of Native American languages "spoken at home" in the United States (American Community Survey 2006–2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/other/detailed-lang-tables.xls|format=XLS|title=Table 1. Detailed Languages Spoken at Home and Ability to Speak English for the Population 5 Years and Over for the United States: 2006-2008 : Release Date: April, 2010|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=January 18, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922225023/https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/other/detailed-lang-tables.xls|archivedate=September 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not an exhaustive list of Native American languages in the US. Because the distinction between dialect and language isn't always clear, multiple dialects of varying [[mutually intelligible|mutual intelligibility]] may be classified as a single language, while a group of effectively identical dialects may be classified separately for historical or cultural reasons. Languages included here may be classified as "extinct" (having no living native speakers), but many extinct or moribund Native American languages are the subjects of ongoing [[language revitalization]] efforts; other extinct languages undergoing revitalization might not be listed here.

A sign-language [[trade]] [[pidgin]], known as [[Plains Indian Sign Language]], Plains Standard or Plains Sign Talk, arose among the [[Plains Indians|Native Americans of the plains]]. Each signing nation had a separate signed version of their oral language, that was used by the hearing, and these were not mutually intelligible. Plains Standard was used to communicate between these nations. It seems to have started in Texas and then spread north, through the [[Great Plains]], as far as [[British Columbia]]. There are still a few users today, especially among the [[Crow Indians|Crow]], [[Cheyenne Indians|Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]. Unlike other sign languages developed by hearing people, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages. Through intergenerational transmission, Plains Sign Talk became a working language still in use today in some Deaf First Nations or Native American communities.

As Plains Sign Talk was so widespread and was a spectrum of dialects and accents, it probably hosted several languages under its umbrella. One is potentially Navajo Sign Language which is in use by a sole Navajo clan.

Additionally, [[Plateau Sign Language]] existed alongside Plains Sign Talk as either a trade pidgin or another language around the [[Columbia Plateau]] and surrounding regions.

====Hawaiian====
[[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] is an official state language of [[Hawaii]] as prescribed in the [[Constitution of Hawaii]]. Hawaiian has 1,000 native speakers. Formerly considered critically endangered, Hawaiian is showing signs of language renaissance. The recent trend is based on new Hawaiian language immersion programs of the [[Hawaii State Department of Education]] and the [[University of Hawaii]], as well as efforts by the [[Hawaii State Legislature]] and county governments to preserve Hawaiian place names. In 1993, about 8,000 could speak and understand it; today estimates range up to 27,000. Hawaiian is related to the [[Māori language]] spoken by around 150,000 New Zealanders and Cook Islanders as well as the [[Tahitian language]] which is spoken by another 120,000 people of Tahiti.

====Samoan====
[[Samoan language|Samoan]] is an official territorial language of [[American Samoa]]. Samoans make up 90% of the population, and most people are bilingual.

====Chamorro====
[[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] is co-official in the [[Mariana Islands]], both in the territory of [[Guam]] and in the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. In Guam, the indigenous [[Chamorro people]] make up about 60% of the population.

====Carolinian====
[[Carolinian language|Carolinian]] is also co-official in the Northern Marianas, where only 14% of people speak English at home.

Some of the first European languages to be spoken in the U.S. are English, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].

From the mid-19th century on, the nation had large numbers of immigrants who spoke little or no English, and throughout the country state laws, constitutions, and legislative proceedings appeared in the languages of politically important immigrant groups. There have been bilingual schools and local newspapers in such languages as [[German language|German]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cantonese]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and others, despite opposing English-only laws that, for example, illegalized church services, telephone conversations, and even conversations in the street or on railway platforms in any language other than English, until the first of these laws was ruled unconstitutional in 1923 (''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'').

Currently, Asian languages account for the majority of languages spoken in immigrant communities: [[Korean language|Korean]], the [[Chinese language|varieties of Chinese]], and various Indian or South Asian languages like [[Hindi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindi-most-spoken-indian-language-in-us-telugu-speakers-up-86-in-8-years/articleshow/65893224.cms|title=Hindi most spoken Indian language in US, Telugu speakers up 86% in 8 years}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urdu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Kannada]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], as well as [[Arabic]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], Tagalog, [[Persian language|Persian]], and others.

Typically, immigrant languages tend to be lost through assimilation within two or three generations,{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} though there are some groups such as the [[Cajuns]] (French), [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] (German) in a state where large numbers of people were heard to speak it before the 1950s, and the original settlers of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] (Spanish) who have maintained their languages for centuries.

===English===
{{Main article|American English}}
[[File:English USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|right|English language distribution in the United States.]]
'''[[English language|English]]''' was inherited from [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]], and it is spoken by the majority of the population. It serves as the [[de facto]] national language, the language in which government business is carried out. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 80% spoke only English at home and all but approximately 13,600,000 U.S. residents age 5 and over speak English "well" or "very well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acs-22.pdf|format=PDF|title=Detailed Languages Spoken at Home by English-Speaking Ability for the Population 5 Years and Over: 2011|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=October 20, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109200819/http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acs-22.pdf|archivedate=November 9, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American English]] is different from [[British English]] in terms of spelling (one example being the dropped "u" in words such as color/colour), grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and slang usage. The differences are not usually a barrier to effective communication between an [[American English]] and a British English speaker, but there are certainly enough differences to cause occasional misunderstandings, usually surrounding slang or region dialect differences.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Some states, like [[California]], have amended their constitutions to make English the only official language, but in practice, this only means that official government documents must ''at least'' be in English, and ''does not'' mean that they should be exclusively available only in English. For example, the standard California Class C [[driver's license]] examination is available in 32 different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmv.ca.gov/dl/dl_info.htm|title=Driver License and Identification Card Information|publisher=Dmv.ca.gov|accessdate=January 18, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930113026/http://dmv.ca.gov/dl/dl_info.htm|archivedate=September 30, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish===
{{Main article|Spanish language in the United States}}
[[File:Spanish USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|Spanish language distribution in the United States]]

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] was also inherited from colonization and is sanctioned as official in the commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]]. Spanish is also taught in various regions as a [[second language]], especially in areas with large Hispanic populations such as the [[Southwestern United States]] along the border with Mexico, as well as [[Florida]], parts of [[California]], the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], [[Illinois]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]. In Hispanic communities across the country, bilingual signs in both Spanish and English may be quite common. Furthermore, numerous neighborhoods exist (such as [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] in [[New York City]] or [[Little Havana]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]) in which entire city blocks will have only Spanish language signs and Spanish-speaking people.

In addition to Spanish-speaking Hispanic populations, younger generations of non-Hispanics in the United States seem to be learning Spanish in larger numbers due to the growing Hispanic population and increasing popularity of Latin American movies and music performed in the Spanish language. A 2009 American Community Survey conducted by the [[United States Census Bureau]], showed that Spanish is the primary language spoken at home by over 35 million people aged 5 or older,&lt;ref name="2009 survey"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/population/ancestry_language_spoken_at_home.html|title=Table 53.

In [[northern New Mexico]] and southern [[Colorado]], Spanish speakers have been isolated for centuries in the southern [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], and developed a distinct dialect of Spanish spoken nowhere else: [[New Mexican Spanish]]. The dialect features a mix of [[Castilian language|Castilian]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and, more recently, [[Mexican Spanish]], as well as [[Pueblo]] loan words. New Mexican Spanish also contains a large proportion of English loan words, particularly for technological words (e.g. ''bos'', ''troca'', and ''telefón'').

[[Nuevomexicanos|Speakers of New Mexican Spanish]] are mainly descendants of Spanish colonists who arrived in New Mexico in the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries. During this time, contact with the rest of Spanish America was limited, and New Mexican Spanish developed on its own course. In the meantime, Spanish colonists coexisted with and intermarried with Puebloan peoples and Navajos. After the Mexican–American War, New Mexico and all its inhabitants came under the governance of the English-speaking United States, and for the next hundred years, English-speakers increased in number. 

'''[[Spanglish]]''' is a [[code-switching]] variant of Spanish and English and is spoken in areas with large bilingual populations of Spanish and English speakers, such as along the [[Mexico–United States border]] ([[California]], [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Texas]]), [[Florida]], and [[New York City]].

===Chinese===
{{Main article|Chinese language and varieties in the United States}}
The population of Chinese speakers was increasing rapidly in the 20th century because the number of Chinese immigrants increased at a rate more than 50% since 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=7__Bg6IM6RcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=languages+in+america&amp;ots=c3rhGJHc1K&amp;sig=aG-MNCz0-fm8hjTp0Paq-wrg9K8#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese&amp;f=false|title=Languages in America: A Pluralist View|last=Dicker|first=Susan J.|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=9781853596513|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2.8 million Americans speak some [[Varieties of Chinese|variety of Chinese]], which combined are counted by the federal census as the third most-spoken language in the country. Until the late 20th century, [[Yue dialects]] including [[Taishanese]] and [[Cantonese]] were the most common among immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, especially in [[California]]. Since the opening of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], Mandarin, the official language in PRC and [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (Taiwan) has become increasingly prevalent.&lt;ref name="Lai"&gt;{{Citation | last = Lai | first = H. Mark | title = Becoming Chinese American or Taiwanese American: A History of Communities and Institutions | publisher = AltaMira Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7591-0458-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Americans of all ethnic backgrounds are also learning Mandarin and to a far lesser extent Cantonese.&lt;ref name="Lai"/&gt;

In [[New York City]] in 2002, Mandarin was spoken as a native language among only 10% of Chinese speakers but was predicted to replace Cantonese as the [[lingua franca]] among Chinese speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = García | first1 = Ofelia | last2 = Fishman |first2 = Joshua A. | title = The Multilingual Apple: Languages in New York City | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2002 | isbn = 3-11-017281-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tagalog===
[[File:Tagalog USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|Tagalog language distribution in the United States.]]
Tagalog speakers were already present in the United States as early as the late sixteenth century as sailors contracted by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial government]]. In the eighteenth century, they established settlements in [[Louisiana]], such as [[Saint Malo, Louisiana|Saint Malo]]. After the [[Philippine–American War|American annexation of the Philippines]], the number of Tagalog speakers steadily increased, as Filipinos began to migrate to the U.S. as students or contract laborers. Their numbers, however, decreased upon [[Republic Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]], as some Filipinos were [[Filipino Repatriation Act of 1935|repatriated]].

Today, Tagalog, together with its standardized form [[Filipino language|Filipino]], is spoken by over a million and a half [[Filipino American]]s and is promoted by Filipino American civic organizations and Philippine consulates. As [[Filipino American|Filipinos]] are the second largest [[Asian people|Asian]] ethnic group in the United States, Tagalog is the second most spoken [[Asian language]] in the country. [[Taglish]], a form of [[code-switching]] between Tagalog and English, is also spoken by a number of Filipino Americans.

Tagalog is also taught at some universities where a significant number of Filipinos exist. As it is the national and most spoken language of the Philippines, most Filipinos in the United States are proficient in Tagalog in addition to their local regional language.

===Vietnamese===
[[File:Vietnamese USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|right|Spread of the Vietnamese language in the United States]]
According to the [[United States 2010 Census|2010 Census]], there are over 1.5 million Americans who identify themselves as Vietnamese in origin, ranking fourth among the Asian American groups and forming the largest [[Overseas Vietnamese]] population.

[[Orange County, California]], is home to the largest concentration of ethnic Vietnamese outside Vietnam, especially in its [[Little Saigon]] area. Other significant Vietnamese communities are found in the metropolitan areas of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Houston]], [[Seattle]], [[Northern Virginia]], and [[New Orleans]]. Similarly to other overseas Vietnamese communities in Western countries (except France), the Vietnamese population in the United States was established following the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975 and communist takeover of [[South Vietnam]] following the [[Vietnam War]].

[[French language|French]], the fourth-most-common language (when all varieties of Chinese are combined and separate yet related languages such as Haitian Creole are counted as French), is spoken mainly by the [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]], native [[France|French]], [[Cajuns|Cajun]], [[Haiti]]an, and [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] populations. It is widely spoken in [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Vermont]], and in [[Louisiana]], with notable Francophone enclaves in [[St. Clair County, Michigan]], many rural areas of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|northern San Francisco Bay area]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Many of the New England communities are connected to the dialect found across the border in Quebec or New Brunswick. More than 13 million Americans possess primary French heritage, but only 2 million speak French or a French Creole language at home.

[[File:German language by country in the US.gif|thumb|German language distribution in the United States.]]
[[German language|German]] was a widely spoken language in some of the colonies, especially Pennsylvania, where a number of German-speaking [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and other religious minorities settled to escape persecution in Europe. Another wave of settlement occurred when Germans fleeing the failure of 19th Century German revolutions emigrated to the United States. A large number of these German immigrants settled in the urban areas, with neighborhoods in many cities being German-speaking and numerous local German language newspapers and periodicals established. German farmers also took up farming around the country, including the [[Texas Hill Country]], at this time. The language was widely spoken until the United States entered [[World War I]].

In the early twentieth century, German was the most widely studied foreign language in the United States, and prior to [[World War I]], more than 6%{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} of American schoolchildren received their primary education exclusively in German, though some of these Germans came from areas outside of Germany proper. Currently, more than 49 million Americans claim [[German American|German ancestry]], the largest self-described ethnic group in the U.S., but less than 4% of them speak a language other than English at home, according to the 2005 [[American Community Survey]].&lt;ref name="2005 ACS German"&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-reg=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201:535;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR:535;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T:535;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR:535&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-TABLE_NAMEX=&amp;-ci_type=A&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-charIterations=047&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124114349/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-reg=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201%3A535%3BACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR%3A535%3BACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T%3A535%3BACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR%3A535&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-TABLE_NAMEX=&amp;-ci_type=A&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-charIterations=047&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en|date=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Amish]] speak a dialect of German known as [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]]. One reason for this decline of German language was the perception during both World Wars that speaking the language of the enemy was unpatriotic; foreign language instruction was banned in places during the First World War. Unlike earlier waves, they were more concentrated in cities and integrated quickly. Another reason for the decline in German was the lack of first-generation immigrants, as immigration to the United States from Western Europe slowed following the World Wars.

There is a myth (known as the [[Muhlenberg legend|Muhlenberg Vote]]) that German was to be the official language of the U.S., but this is inaccurate and based on a failed early attempt to have government documents translated into German.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth also extends to German being the second official language of Pennsylvania; however, Pennsylvania has no official language. Although more than 49 million Americans claim they have German ancestors, only 1.24 million Americans speak German at home. Many of these people are either Amish and Mennonites or Germans having newly immigrated (e.g. for professional reasons).

===Arabic===
{{Main article|Arabic in the United States}}
[[Varieties of Arabic]] are spoken by immigrants from the [[Middle East]] as well as many [[Islam in the United States|Muslim Americans]]. The highest concentrations of native Arabic speakers reside in heavily urban areas like [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], and [[Los Angeles]]. [[Detroit]] and the surrounding areas of Michigan boast a significant Arabic-speaking population including many Arab Christians of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Syrian]], and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] descent.

Arabic is used for religious purposes by Muslim Americans and by some Arab Christians (notably [[Catholics]] of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite]] and [[Maronite]] Churches as well as Rum Orthodox, i.e. [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antiochian Orthodox Christians]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] churches.). A significant number of educated Arab professionals who immigrate often already know English quite well, as it is widely used in the Middle East. Lebanese immigrants also have a broader understanding of French as do many Arabic-speaking immigrants from [[North Africa]]. {{reference needed|date=May 2018}}

===Italian===
{{Main article|Italian language in the United States}}
[[File:Italian USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|right|Current distribution of the Italian language in the United States.]]
The [[Italian language]] and its various [[Languages of Italy|dialects]] have been widely spoken in the United States for more than one hundred years, primarily due to large-scale immigration from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century.

In addition to Standard Italian learned by most people today, there has been a strong representation of the dialects and languages of Southern Italy amongst the immigrant population ([[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] in particular). As of 2009, though 15,638,348 American citizens report themselves as Italian-Americans, only 753,992 of these report speaking the Italian language at home (0.3264% of the US population).

===Dutch===
[[File:Dutch USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|Dutch language distribution in the United States.]]
There has been a Dutch presence in America since 1602 when the government of the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] chartered the [[Dutch East India Company]] (''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', or VOC) with the mission of exploring for a passage to the [[Indies]] and claiming any uncharted territories for the Dutch republic. In 1664, English troops under the command of the Duke of [[York]] (later [[James II of England]]) attacked the [[New Netherland]] colony. Being greatly outnumbered, director general [[Peter Stuyvesant]] surrendered [[New Amsterdam]], with [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] following soon. New Amsterdam was renamed [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] was renamed [[Fort Frederick (Albany)|Fort Albany]]. Dutch city names can still be found in New York's neighbourhoods. [[Harlem]] is [[Haarlem]], Staten Island is Staten Eiland and [[Brooklyn]] refers to [[Breukelen]].

Dutch was still spoken in many parts of New York at the time of the Revolution. For example, [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s wife [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton|Eliza Hamilton]] attended a Dutch-language church during their marriage.

African-American abolitionist and women's rights activist [[Sojourner Truth]] (born 'Isabella Baumfree') was a native speaker of Dutch.

[[Martin Van Buren]], the first President born in the United States following its independence, spoke Dutch as his [[native language]], making him the only President whose [[first language]] was not English.

In a 1990 demographic consensus, 3% of surveyed citizens claimed descent from Dutch settlers. Modern estimates place the [[Dutch American]] population at 5 million, lagging just a bit behind [[Scottish Americans]] and [[Swedish Americans]].

Notable Dutch Americans include the Roosevelts ([[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]), [[Marlon Brando]], [[Thomas Alva Edison]], [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[Vanderbilt family|the Vanderbilts]]. The Roosevelts are direct descendants of Dutch settlers of the [[New Netherland]] colony in the 17th century.

Around 136,000 people in the United States still speak the Dutch language at home today. They are concentrated mainly in [[California]] (23,500), [[Florida]] (10,900), [[Pennsylvania]] (9,900), [[Ohio]] (9,600), New York (8,700) and [[Michigan]] (6,600; i.e. almost entirely in the city of [[Holland, Michigan|Holland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&amp;mode=lang_tops&amp;SRVY_YEAR=2010&amp;lang_id=610|title=Dutch : Source: American Community Survey : 5-Year Estimates, Public Use Microdata Sample, 2006–2010|publisher=Mla.org|accessdate=January 18, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113032530/http://www.mla.org/map_data_results%26mode%3Dlang_tops%26SRVY_YEAR%3D2010%26lang_id%3D610|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vernacular dialect of Dutch, known as [[Jersey Dutch]] was spoken by a significant number of people in the [[New Jersey]] area between the start of the 17th century to the mid-20th century. With the beginning of the 20th century, usage of the language became restricted to internal family circles, with an ever-growing number of people abandoning the language in favor of English. It suffered gradual decline throughout the 20th century, and it ultimately dissipated from casual usage.

===Finnish===
[[File:Finnish USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|Finnish language distribution in the United States.]]
The first Finnish settlers in America were amongst the settlers who came from Sweden and Finland to the [[New Sweden]] colony. Most colonists were Finnish. However, the Finnish language was not preserved as well among subsequent generations as Swedish.

Between the 1890s and the outbreak of the first World War, an estimated quarter million [[Finnish citizen]]s immigrated to the United States, mainly in rural areas of the [[Midwest]] and more specifically in the mining regions of Northeastern [[Minnesota]], Northern Wisconsin and [[Michigan]]'s [[Upper Peninsula]]. [[Hancock, Michigan]], as of 2005, still incorporates bi-lingual street signs written in both English and Finnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

There is a distinctive dialect of English to be found in the Upper Peninsula, known as [[Yooper dialect|Yooper]]. Yooper often has a Finnish cadence and uses Finnish sentence structure with modified English, German, Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish vocabulary.
Notable Finnish Americans include U.S. Communist Party leader [[Gus Hall]], film director [[Renny Harlin]], and the Canadian-born actress [[Pamela Anderson]]. 

Northern Clark County, Washington (encompassing Yacolt, Amboy, Battle Ground and Chelatchie) contains a large exclave of Old Apostolic Lutherans who originally immigrated from Finland. Many families in this portion of the county speak fluent Finnish at home before learning English. Another noteworthy Finnish community in the United States is found in [[Lake Worth, Florida]], north of Miami.

===Russian===
{{Main article|Russian language in the United States}}
[[File:Russian USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|Russian language distribution in the United States.]]
The [[Russian language]] is spoken in areas of some states, including [[New York (state)|New York]], [[California]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[New Jersey]], [[Illinois]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Alaska]]. It is especially spoken in immigrant neighborhoods of some cities: [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Chicago]], [[Seattle]], [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Vancouver, Washington]], [[Portland, Oregon]], and Woodburn, Oregon. The [[Russian-American Company]] used to own [[Alaska Territory]] until selling it after the [[Crimean War]]. Russian had always been limited, especially after the assassination of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]] of [[tsar]]s. Starting in the 1970s and continuing until the mid-1990s, many people from the [[Soviet Union]] and later its constituent republics such as [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and [[Uzbekistan]] have immigrated to the United States, increasing the language's usage in America.

The largest Russian-speaking neighborhoods in the United States are found in [[Queens]], [[Brooklyn]], and [[Staten Island]] in [[New York City]] (specifically the [[Brighton Beach, Brooklyn|Brighton Beach]] area of Brooklyn); parts of [[Los Angeles]], particularly [[West Los Angeles]] and [[West Hollywood]]; parts of [[Philadelphia]], particularly the [[Far Northeast Philadelphia|Far Northeast]]; and parts of [[Miami]] like [[Sunny Isles Beach]].

In [[Nikolaevsk, Alaska]], 66.57% of the population speaks Russian at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apps.mla.org/map_data_results%26SRVY_YEAR%3D2000%26geo%3D%26state_id%3D2%26county_id%3D%26mode%3Dplace%26lang_id%3D%26zip%3D%26place_id%3D54085%26cty_id%3D%26region_id%3D%26division_id%3D%26ll%3D%26ea%3Dy%26order%3D%26a%3Dy%26pc%3D1|title=Data Center Results|date=May 25, 2017|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=October 16, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525064035/https://apps.mla.org/map_data_results%26SRVY_YEAR%3D2000%26geo%3D%26state_id%3D2%26county_id%3D%26mode%3Dplace%26lang_id%3D%26zip%3D%26place_id%3D54085%26cty_id%3D%26region_id%3D%26division_id%3D%26ll%3D%26ea%3Dy%26order%3D%26a%3Dy%26pc%3D1|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ilocano===
Like the [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]], the [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]] are an [[Austronesian]] stock which came from the [[Philippines]]. They were the first Filipinos to migrate en masse to the United States. They first entered the [[State of Hawaii]] and worked there in the vast plantations.

As they did in the Philippine provinces of Northern [[Luzon]] and [[Mindanao]], they quickly gained importance in the areas where they settled. Thus, the state of [[Hawaii]] became no less different from the [[Philippines]] in terms of percentage of [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] speakers.

Like Tagalog, [[Ilokano language|Ilocano]] is also being taught in universities where most of the [[Filipino American|Filipinos]] reside.

===South Asian languages===
There are many South Asians in the United States. These include [[Indian American|Indians]], [[Pakistani American|Pakistanis]], and [[Bangladeshi American|Bangladeshis]], who speak various South Asian languages. Major [[Languages of South Asia|South Asian languages]] spoken in the US include [[Telugu language|Telugu]] (see paragraph on Telugu below), [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], and [[Marathi language|Marathi]].

===Tamil===
The Tamil community in the United States is largely bilingual. Tamil is taught in weekly classes in many Hindu temples and by associations such as the American Tamil Academy in South Brunswick, Tamil Jersey School in Jersey City, New Jersey,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ns.gmnews.com/news/2014-09-04/Front_Page/School_offers_Tamil_language_classes.html "School offers Tamil language classes" ''Sentinel'' Sept. 4, 2014] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315035938/http://ns.gmnews.com/news/2014-09-04/Front_Page/School_offers_Tamil_language_classes.html |date=March 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The written form of the language is highly formal and quite distinct from the spoken form. A few universities, such as the University of Chicago and the University of California Berkeley, have graduate programs in the language.&lt;ref&gt;Vasudha Narayanan, "Tamils" in David Levinson and Melvin Ember, eds. ''American immigrant cultures: builders of a nation'' (1997). p. 878.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 20th century, Tamils from India migrated as skilled [[professional]]s to the United States, [[Canada]], [[Europe]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. The Tamil American population numbers over 195,685 individuals,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/other/detailed-lang-tables.xls US Census 2006-2008 American Community Survey See Row# 125]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federation of Tamil Sangams of North America]] functions as an [[umbrella organization]] for the growing community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fetna.org/index.php/2011-12-22-02-18-20/2011-12-22-02-21-42|title=ABOUT FETNA|publisher=Federation of Tamil Sangams of North America|accessdate=April 1, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116211514/http://www.fetna.org/index.php/2011-12-22-02-18-20/2011-12-22-02-21-42|archivedate=January 16, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telugu===
In the second half of the 20th century, Telugu people from India migrated as [[professional]]s to the United States, [[Canada]], [[Europe]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. The Telugu American population enumerates over 886,988 individuals,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/other/detailed-lang-tables.xls US Census 2006-2008 American Community Survey See Row# 122] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604062111/http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/other/detailed-lang-tables.xls |date=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federation of Telugu Sangams of North America]] functions as an [[NATA &amp; TANA organizations]] for the growing community.

[[Central Jersey|Central New Jersey]] is home to the largest population concentration of Telugu people. Telugu people have also settled in [[New York City]] and the [[Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area]], as well as on the West Coast in Silicon Valley, where there are Telugu associations such as TANA, ATA &amp; NATA. The [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] metropolitan areas are home to the largest concentrations of Telugu-speakers.

===Irish===
About 40 million Americans have Irish ancestry, many of whose ancestors would have spoken [[Irish language|Irish]]. According to the 2007 American Community Survey, 22,279 people speak Irish at home.
{{As of|2008}} it was the 76th most spoken language in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language Use in the US 2006–2008 (850k Excel file!)|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/other/detailed-lang-tables.xls|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=June 23, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622082540/http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/other/detailed-lang-tables.xls|archivedate=June 22, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khmer (Cambodian)===
{{main article|Cambodian Americans}}
Between 1981 and 1985 about 150,000 Cambodians resettled in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apiahf.org/resources/pdf/Cambodians_in_the_United_States.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325111513/http://www.apiahf.org/resources/pdf/Cambodians_in_the_United_States.pdf|date=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1975 very few Cambodians came to the United States. Those who did were children of upper-class families sent abroad to attend school. After the fall of [[Phnom Penh]] to the communist Khmer Rouge in 1975, some Cambodians managed to escape. In 2007 the American Community Survey reported that there were approximately 200,000 Cambodians living in the United States, making up about 2% percent of the Asian population. This population is, however, heavily concentrated in two areas: the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] in [[California]], especially the city of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]; and [[Greater Boston]] in [[New England]], especially [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. These two areas hold a majority of the Cambodians living in the US.

===Polish===
The [[Polish language]] is very common in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]]. Chicago's third largest [[white ethnic]] groups are [[Polish American|those of Polish descent]], after [[German Americans|German]] and [[Irish Americans|Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_14_5YR_B04006&amp;prodType=table |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722210724/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_14_5YR_B04006&amp;prodType=table |archivedate=July 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Poles|Polish people]] and the Polish language in Chicago were very prevalent in the early years of the city, and today the 650,000 Poles in [[Chicago]] make up one of the largest ethnically [[Polish diaspora|Polish populations in the world]], comparable to the city of [[Wrocław]], the fourth largest city in Poland.

===Portuguese===
{{further|Portuguese Americans|Brazilian Americans|Cape Verdean Americans}}

The first Portuguese speakers in America were [[Portuguese Jews]] who had fled the [[Portuguese Inquisition]]. They spoke [[Judeo-Portuguese]] and founded the earliest Jewish communities in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], two of which still exist: [[Congregation Shearith Israel]] in New York and [[Congregation Mikveh Israel]] in Philadelphia. However, by the end of the 18th century, their use of Portuguese had been replaced by English.

In the late 19th century, many Portuguese, mainly [[Azorean]]s, [[Madeiran]]s and [[Cape Verdeans]] (who prior to independence in 1975 were Portuguese citizens), immigrated to the United States, settling in cities like [[Providence, Rhode Island]], [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], and [[Santa Cruz, California]]. There was also a substantial [[Portuguese immigration to Hawaii]], which at the time was not yet part of the United States.

In the mid-late 20th century there was another wave of Portuguese immigration to the US, mainly the Northeast (New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts), and for a time [[History of the Lusophone Americans in Newark, New Jersey|Portuguese became a major language in Newark, New Jersey]]. Many Portuguese Americans may include descendants of Portuguese settlers born in [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Portuguese Africa]] (known as [[Portuguese Africans]], or, in Portugal, as ''[[retornados]]'') and [[Asia]] (mostly [[Macau]]). There were around 1 million [[Portuguese American]]s in the United States by the year 2000. Portuguese ([[European Portuguese]]) has been spoken in the United States by small communities of immigrants, mainly in the metropolitan [[New York City]] area, like [[Newark, New Jersey]].

The Portuguese language is also spoken widely by [[Brazilian Americans]], concentrated in [[Miami]], [[New York City]], and [[Boston]].

===Swedish===
[[File:Swedish USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|Swedish language distribution in the United States.]]
There has been a Swedish presence in America since the [[New Sweden]] colony came into existence in March 1638.

Widespread diaspora of Swedish immigration did not occur until the latter half of the 19th century, bringing in a total of a million Swedes. No other country had a higher percentage of its people leave for the United States except Ireland and Norway. At the beginning of the 20th century, [[Minnesota]] had the highest ethnic Swedish population in the world after the city of [[Stockholm]].

3.7% of US residents claim descent from Scandinavian ancestors, amounting to roughly 11–12 million people. According to SIL's Ethnologue, over half a million ethnic Swedes still speak the language, though according to the 2007 American Community Survey only 56,715 speak it at home. [[Cultural assimilation]] has contributed to the gradual and steady decline of the language in the US. After the independence of the US from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the government encouraged colonists to adopt the English language as a common medium of communication, and in some cases, imposed it upon them. Subsequent generations of Swedish Americans received education in English and spoke it as their first language. Lutheran churches scattered across the Midwest started abandoning Swedish in favor of English as their language of worship. Swedish newspapers and publications alike slowly faded away.

There are sizable Swedish communities in Minnesota, Ohio, Maryland, Philadelphia, and Delaware, along with small isolated pockets in Pennsylvania, San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale, and New York. Chicago once contained a large Swedish enclave called [[Andersonville, Chicago|Andersonville]] on the city's north side.

[[John Morton (American politician)|John Morton]], the person who cast the decisive vote leading to Pennsylvania's support for the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], was of Finnish descent. Finland was part of the Kingdom of Sweden in the 18th century.

===Welsh===
[[File:Welsh USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|Welsh language distribution in the United States.]]
Up to two million Americans are thought to have Welsh ancestry. However, there is very little [[Welsh language|Welsh]] being used commonly in the USA. According to the 2007 American Community Survey, 2,285 people speak Welsh at home; primarily spoken in [[California]] (415), [[Florida]] (225), [[New York (state)|New York]] (204), [[Ohio]] (135), and [[New Jersey]] (130).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&amp;mode=lang_tops&amp;SRVY_YEAR=2000&amp;lang_id=633|title=Welsh : Source: Census 2000, Summary File 3|publisher=Mla.org|accessdate=January 18, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112758/http://www.mla.org/map_data_results%26mode%3Dlang_tops%26SRVY_YEAR%3D2000%26lang_id%3D633|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some place names, such as [[Bryn Mawr Historic District|Bryn Mawr in Chicago]] and [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]] ({{lang-en|Big Hill}}) are Welsh. Several towns in [[Pennsylvania]], mostly in the [[Welsh Tract]], have Welsh namesakes, including [[Uwchlan Township, Pennsylvania|Uwchlan]], [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania|Bala Cynwyd]], [[Lower Gwynedd Township, Pennsylvania|Gwynedd]], and [[Tredyffrin Township, Pennsylvania|Tredyffrin]].

===Yiddish===
[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] has a much longer history in the United States than Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joshua A. Fishman|title=Yiddish: turning to life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MKJFx1b3xAC|year=1991|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-2075-2|pages=148–159|chapter=Appendix: The Hebrew Language in the United States|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MKJFx1b3xAC&amp;pg=PA148|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102091443/https://books.google.com/books?id=4MKJFx1b3xAC|archivedate=January 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been present since at least the late 19th century and continues to have roughly 148,000 speakers as of the 2009 American Community Survey. Though they came from varying geographic backgrounds and nuanced approaches to worship, immigrant Jews of Eastern Europe and Russia were often united under a common understanding of the Yiddish language once they settled in America, and at one point dozens of publications were available in most East Coast cities. Though it has declined by quite a bit since the end of WWII, it has by no means disappeared. Many Israeli immigrants and expatriates have at least some understanding of the language in addition to Hebrew, and many of the descendants of the great migration of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] of the past century pepper their mostly English vocabulary with some loan words. Furthermore, it is a lingua franca among Orthodox Jewry (particularly [[Hasidic]] Jewry), concentrated in Los Angeles, Miami, and New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Nepali===
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2017}}
The first Nepalese to enter the United States were classified as "other Asian". Immigration records show that between 1881 and 1890, 1,910 "other Asians" were admitted to the United States. However, Nepal did not open its borders until 1950, and most Nepalis who left the country during that time went primarily to India to study. Nepalese Americans were first classified as a separate ethnic group in 1974 when 56 Nepalese immigrated to the United States. New York City, Boston, Chicago, Denver, [[Gainesville, Florida]], Portland, Oregon and Saint Paul, Minnesota have the largest number of Nepalese. There are some Nepalese community or cultural events in every American state, including [[Dashain]], [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]], [[Losar]], [[Holi]], [[Teej]] Special, and [[Nepali New Year]].

==New American languages, dialects, and creoles==
Several languages have developed on American soil, including [[creole language|creole]]s and [[sign language]]s.

===African-American English===
{{main|African-American English}}
Often simply called AAE and known in [[North America]] as Black English, is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[American English]] along a continuum, spoken primarily by urban [[working class|working-class]] and (largely [[wikt:bidialectal|bidialectal]] and [[codeswitching]]) [[middle class|middle-class]] [[African Americans]].{{sfnp|Edwards|2004|p=383}}. It is generally accepted among linguists and many African Americans that [[Southern American English]] is closely related to AAE because AAE is part of a historical continuum between creoles such as [[Gullah]] and Southern American English.

Some educators view AAE as exerting a negative influence on the learning of Standard English, as AAE differs grammatically from Standard English. Other educators, however, propose that Standard English should be taught as a "second dialect" in educational contexts where AAE is a strong part of students' culture. {{reference needed|date= May 2018}}

===Chinuk Wawa or Chinook Jargon===
{{main|Chinook Jargon}}
A Creole language of 700–800 words of French, English, Cree and other Native origins. It is the old trade language of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It was used extensively among both European and Native peoples of the [[Oregon Territory]], even used instead of English at home by many [[American pioneers|pioneer families]]. It is estimated that around 100,000 people spoke it at its peak, between 1858 and 1900, and it was last widely used in [[Seattle]] just before [[World War II]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Gullah===
{{main|Gullah language}}
An English-African creole language spoken on the [[Sea Islands]] of [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], retains strong influences of West African languages. The language is sometimes referred to as "Geechee".

===Hawai'i Creole English===
{{main|Hawaiian Pidgin}}
{{distinguish|Hawaiian English}}
Commonly used by locals and is considered an unofficial language of the state.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Louisiana Creole French===
{{main|Louisiana Creole French}}
A [[French-based creole languages|French Creole]] language spoken by the [[Louisiana Creole people]] of the state of [[Louisiana]], close to [[Haitian Creole]], [[Colonial French]], and [[Cajun French]] (language of Acadians deported from [[Nouvelle France|New France]] after 1755 and the [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Grand Dérangement]]).
[[French-based creole languages|French Creole]] languages are spoken by millions of people worldwide, mainly in the [[United States]], Caribbean, and [[Indian Ocean]] areas.

===Outer Banks languages===
In the islands of the [[Outer Banks]] off [[North Carolina]], several unique English dialects have developed. This is evident on [[Harkers Island, North Carolina|Harkers Island]] and [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke Island]]. These dialects are sometimes referred to as "[[high tider]]".

===Pennsylvania German===
{{main|Pennsylvania German language}}
A language that traditionally was spoken mainly in [[Pennsylvania]], but that since the 19th century has spread to the Midwest (Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states), where the majority of speakers live today. It evolved from the [[German dialects|German dialect]] of the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] brought over to America by the [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania Dutch people]] before 1800. Originally spoken by adherents of different Christian denominations ([[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren|German Baptist Brethren]], [[Catholicism|Catholics]]) today it is mainly spoken by Amish and [[Old Order Mennonite]]s.

===Texas Silesian===
{{main|Texas Silesian}}
A dialect of [[Silesian language|Silesian]] used by Texas [[Silesians]] in American settlements from 1852 to the present.

===Chesapeake Bay Islander===
Another dialectal isolate is that spoken on [[Tangier Island]], [[Virginia]] and [[Smith Island, Maryland]], both located toward the southern end of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The dialect is partially derived from English as spoken by English pre-[[American Revolution|Revolutionary]] settlers, and partially from the present-day Middle-Atlantic American dialect of English. It also contains some words from the [[Cornish language]], the [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] spoken in [[Cornwall]] in southwest England.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Chicano English===
{{main|Chicano English}}
{{see also|English in New Mexico}}
An English dialect spoken mainly by [[Mexican Americans]] in the [[Southwestern United States]], with influences from [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

===Romani===
[[Angloromani language|Angloromani]] is a creole English language spoken by [[Romani Americans]].

Alongside the numerous and varied oral languages, the United States also boasts several sign languages. Historically, the US was home to some six or more sign languages (that number rising with the probability that Plains Sign Talk is actually a language family with several languages under its umbrella) which has fallen with the death of several of these.

As with all sign languages around the world that developed organically, these are full languages distinct from any oral language. American Sign Language (unlike [[Signed English]]) is not a derivation of English.&lt;ref name="EthnologueASL"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=M.

===American Sign Language===
'''[[American Sign Language]]''' (ASL) is the native language of a number of [[deaf]] and hearing people in America (roughly 100,000 to 500,000). While some sources have stated that ASL is the third most frequently used language in the United States, after English and Spanish,&lt;ref name=preston1995p243&gt;{{Citation|author=Paul Preston|title=Mother father deaf: living between sound and silence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-q_qaxGTJUC|year=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-58748-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=l-q_qaxGTJUC&amp;pg=PA243 243]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102091443/https://books.google.com/books?id=l-q_qaxGTJUC|archivedate=January 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; recent scholarship has pointed out that most of these estimates are based on numbers conflating deafness with ASL use, and that the last actual study of this (in 1972) seems to indicate an upper bound of 500,000 ASL speakers at the time.&lt;ref name=gallaudet2006&gt;{{Citation|last1=Mitchell |first1=Ross E. |last2=Young |first2=Travas A. |last3=Bachleda |first3=Bellamie |last4=Karchmer |first4=Michael A. |title=How Many People Use ASL in the United States?

====Black American Sign Language====
'''[[Black American Sign Language]]''' (BASL) developed in the southeastern US, where separate residential schools were maintained for white and black deaf children. BASL shares much of the same vocabulary and grammatical structure as ASL and is generally considered one of its dialects.&lt;ref name="EthnologueASL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=preston1995p243 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Hawai'i Sign Language===
'''[[Hawaii Sign Language]]''' is moribund with only a handful of speakers on [[O'ahu]], [[Lana'i]], [[Kaua'i]] and possibly [[Ni'ihau]]. Some of these speakers may actually be speaking a creolized version of HSL and ASL, however, research is slow-going. The language was once called Hawai'i Pidgin Sign Language as many people thought it was a derivation of ASL which was discovered to be false and to be a separate language altogether.&lt;ref name="LambrechtEarthWoodward"&gt;{{citation|last=Lambrecht|first=Linda|title=History and Documentation of Hawaiʻi Sign Language: First Report|date=March 3, 2013|url=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/icldc/2013/|df=mdy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322023259/https://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ICLDC/2013/|deadurl=yes|place=University of Hawaiʻi|publisher=3rd International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation|archivedate=March 22, 2013|last2=Earth|first2=Barbara|last3=Woodward|first3=James}}&lt;!-- As of 2013-03-13, materials from this presentation have not yet been posted on the ICLDC3 website, but are due to be posted soon, so I've created the reference with a generic link to the conference under the assumption that we'll soon have a specific link to the presentation's PowerPoint. -AlbertBickford --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plains Sign Talk===
Once a trade pidgin and the most far-reaching sign language in North America, '''[[Plains Indian Sign Language|Plains Sign Talk]]''' or '''Plains Sign Language''' is now critically endangered with an unknown number of speakers.

====Navajo Sign Language====
'''Navajo Sign Language''' has been found to be in use in one clan of [[Navajo people|Navajo]]; however, whether it is a dialect of Plains Sign Talk or a separate language remains unknown.&lt;ref name=Supalla&gt;Samuel J. Supalla (1992) ''The Book of Name Signs'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plateau Sign Language====
Another trade pidgin that may have become a separate language, '''[[Plateau Sign Language]]''' replaced Plains Sign Talk in the [[Columbia Plateau]] and surrounding regions of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It is now extinct.

===Martha's Vineyard Sign Language===
'''[[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]]''' is now extinct. Along with [[French Sign Language]], it was one of several main contributors to American Sign Language.

===Henniker Sign Language===
'''[[Henniker Sign Language]]''' is now extinct but was once found around the [[Henniker, New Hampshire|Henniker]] region of New Hampshire and formed a basis for American Sign Language.

===Sandy River Valley Sign Language===
'''[[Sandy River Valley Sign Language]]''' is now extinct but once could be found around the Sandy River Valley in Maine. It was one of several main contributors to American Sign Language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7751">'''Legal ghostwriting''' is a form of [[unbundled legal services]] in the United States in which an [[Lawyer|attorney]] drafts a document on behalf of a client without formally appearing before the [[court]]. Instead, the client represents his or herself [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|''pro se'']].

==Purpose==

The growth of ''pro se'' [[litigants]] can be attributed to the high cost of litigation, anti-lawyer sentiment, and the advent of [[do-it-yourself]] law services. However, self-represented litigants may still need [[legal representation]] in order and to navigate the [[litigation]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldschmidt|first=Jona|title=In Defense of Ghostwriting|journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal|date=February 2002|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6562/is_3_29/ai_n28916491/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Legal [[ghostwriting]] is one way in which clients can receive legal counsel while maintaining control of their case and avoiding higher legal costs. Attorneys offering legal ghostwriting services often charge a flat fee rather than billing by the hour as is typical for full-service attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legalghostwriting.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Bar Association==

The [[American Bar Association|ABA]] formally endorsed the delivery of legal ghostwriting services by attorneys to ''pro se'' clients in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ethics and Professional Responsibility|first=Standing Committee on|title=Formal Opinion 07-446|url=http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf|work=Undisclosed Legal Assistance to Pro Se Litigants|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=17 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211554/http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a formal opinion, the ABA deemed the practice consistent with Rule 1.2(c) of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] which allows lawyers to unbundle their services to clients. According to the ABA opinion paper, lawyers should generally disclose the fact that papers were prepared by an attorney, but need not disclose their name of firm.

==New York==

The New York County Law Association agreed with the ABA approach to legal ghostwriting in a 2010 ethics opinion paper. In that decision, NYCLA found that “…it is now ethically permissible for an attorney, with the informed consent of his or her client, to play a limited role and prepare pleadings and other submissions for a pro se litigant without disclosing the lawyer’s participation to the tribunal and adverse counsel. Disclosure of the fact that a pleading or submission was prepared by counsel need only be made ‘where necessary.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Professional Ethics|first=Committee on|title=Opinion 742|url=http://www.nycla.org/siteFiles/Publications/Publications1348_0.pdf|work=NYCLA|accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Second Circuit court in 2011 ruled that it was not improper for an attorney to ghostwrite legal pleadings on behalf of a self-represented litigant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Court Rules that Incompetent Lawyering, but Not Legal Ghostwriting, Is Grounds for Sanctions|url=http://legalghostwriting.blogspot.com/2011/11/federal-court-rules-that-incompetent.html|work=LegalGhostwriting Blog|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Criticism==

[[Ethical]] concerns may arise for attorneys offering legal ghostwriting services to clients. A common criticism of legal ghostwriting is that it gives the self-represented litigant an unfair advantage because judges often grant ''pro se'' litigants leeway in the courtroom to make up for their lack of experience. &lt;ref&gt; Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 2.2, Comment [4] (adopted February 2007) (“It is not a violation of this Rule [requiring impartiality and fairness] for a judge to make reasonable accommodations to ensure pro se litigants the opportunity to have their matters fairly heard.”)&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that when clients employ an attorney ghostwriter, they should not be entitled to that privilege. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldschmidt|first=Jona|title=In Defense of Ghostwriting|journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal|year=2002|pages=1145, 1157–1158|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6562/is_3_29/ai_n28916491/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the [[New York State Bar Association]] requires attorneys to disclose their assistance in papers submitted to the court. Attorneys are not, however, required to disclose their name or firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unified Court System|first=New York State|title=Rule 1.2(c)|url=http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/ForAttorneys/ProfessionalStandardsforAttorneys/NYRulesofProfessionalConduct4109.pdf|work=Rules of Professional Conduct|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other critics are concerned that when an attorney provides legal ghostwriting services to a client without disclosing his or her name, the attorney might be misleading the court, or seeking to avoid [[malpractice]] lawsuits or court rules against [[frivolous]] lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klempner|first=Rochelle|title=Unbundled Legal Services in Litigated Matters in New York State|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ip/partnersinjustice/Unbundled.pdf|work=A Proposal To Test the Efficacy through Law School Clinics|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the ABA in its 2007 opinion paper claimed that these ethical concerns were overstated. It concluded that:

"[b]ecause there is no reasonable concern that a litigant appearing ''pro se'' will receive an unfair benefit from a tribunal as a result of behind-the-scenes legal assistance, the nature or extent of such assistance is immaterial and need not be disclosed. Similarly, we do not believe that nondisclosure of the fact of legal assistance is dishonest so as to be prohibited by Rule 8.4(c). Whether it is dishonest for the lawyer to provide undisclosed assistance to a pro se litigant turns on whether the court would be misled by failure to disclose such assistance. The lawyer is making no statement at all to the forum regarding the nature or scope of the representation, and indeed, may be obliged under Rules 1.210 and 1.611 not to reveal the fact of the representation. Absent an affirmative statement by the client, that can be attributed to the lawyer, that the documents were prepared without legal assistance, the lawyer has not been dishonest within the meaning of Rule 8.4(c). For the same reason, we reject the contention that a lawyer who does not appear in the action circumvents court rules requiring the assumption of responsibility for their pleadings. Such rules apply only if a lawyer signs the pleading and thereby makes an affirmative statement to the tribunal concerning the matter. Where a pro se litigant is assisted, no such duty is assumed. We conclude that there is no prohibition in the Model Rules of Professional Conduct against undisclosed assistance to pro se litigants, as long as the lawyer does not do so in a manner that violates rules that otherwise would apply to the lawyer’s conduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211554/http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Nordic Journal of Human Rights''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by the [[Norwegian Centre for Human Rights]] (part of the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Oslo]]) in collaboration with [[Universitetsforlaget]]. The journal takes a broad and cross-disciplinary view on human rights, particularly in a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] context.

In the Norwegian Association of Higher Education Institutions’ ranking of scientific journals ([[Norwegian Scientific Index]]), the journal is ranked as a Level 2 journal (Level 2 comprises up to the 20% most prestigious journals in any discipline, in this case law).&lt;ref&gt;[[Norwegian Social Science Data Services]] (NSD): [http://dbh.nsd.uib.no/kanaler/kanalDetalj.do?produktid=342316&amp;bibsys= Nordic Journal of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal was established in 1982 and was originally published as a Scandinavian-language journal, titled ''Mennesker og Rettigheter'' (Humans and Rights). It was renamed ''Nordisk tidsskrift for menneskerettigheter'' (Nordic Journal of Human Rights) in 2004. In 2010, the journal became an English-language journal, and was renamed ''Nordic Journal of Human Rights''.

{{IPA notice}}
In [[linguistics]], '''Optimality Theory''' (frequently abbreviated '''OT'''; the term is normally capitalized by convention) is a linguistic model proposing that the observed forms of [[language]] arise from the optimal satisfaction of conflicting constraints. OT differs from other approaches to phonological analysis, such as [[autosegmental phonology]] and [[linear phonology]] (SPE), which typically use rules rather than constraints. OT models grammars as systems that provide mappings from inputs to outputs; typically, the inputs are conceived of as [[underlying representation]]s, and the outputs as their surface realizations.

In linguistics, Optimality Theory has its origin in a talk given by [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1991&lt;ref&gt;"Optimality". Proceedings of the talk given at Arizona Phonology
Conference, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.&lt;/ref&gt; which was later developed in an article by the same authors in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Alan, and Smolensky, Paul (1993) "Optimality Theory: Constraint interaction in generative grammar." Technical Report CU-CS-696-93, Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado at Boulder.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
There are three basic components of the theory:

* Generator ({{sc1|Gen}}) takes an input, and generates the list of possible outputs, or candidates,
* Constraint component ({{sc1|Con}}) provides the criteria, in the form of strictly ranked violable constraints, used to decide between candidates, and
* Evaluator ({{sc1|Eval}}) chooses the optimal candidate based on the constraints, and this candidate is the output.

Optimality Theory assumes that these components are universal. Differences in grammars reflect different rankings of the universal constraint set, {{sc1|Con}}. Part of [[language acquisition]] can then be described as the process of adjusting the ranking of these constraints.

Optimality Theory as applied to language was originally proposed by the linguists [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1991, and later expanded by Prince and [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John J. McCarthy]]. Although much of the interest in Optimality Theory has been associated with its use in [[phonology]], the area to which Optimality Theory was first applied, the theory is also applicable to other subfields of [[linguistics]] (e.g. [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]).

Optimality Theory is like other theories of [[generative grammar]] in its focus on the investigation of [[linguistic universal|universal principles]], [[linguistic typology]] and [[language acquisition]].

Optimality Theory also has roots in [[neural network]] research. It arose in part as an alternative to the [[connectionist]] theory of [[Harmonic Grammar]], developed in 1990 by [[Géraldine Legendre]], [[Yoshiro Miyata]] and [[Paul Smolensky]]. Variants of Optimality Theory with connectionist-like weighted constraints continue to be pursued in more recent work (Pater 2009).

==Input and {{sc1|Gen}}: the candidate set==
Optimality Theory supposes that there are no language-specific restrictions on the input. This is called ''richness of the base''. Every grammar can handle every possible input. For example, a language without [[Consonant cluster|complex clusters]] must be able to deal with an input such as {{IPA|/flask/}}. Languages without complex clusters differ on how they will resolve this problem; some will [[epenthesis|epenthesize]] (e.g. {{IPA|[falasak]}}, or {{IPA|[falasaka]}} if all codas are banned) and some will [[Elision|delete]] (e.g. {{IPA|[fas], [fak], [las], [lak]}}).

{{sc1|Gen}} is free to generate any number of output candidates, however much they deviate from the input. This is called ''freedom of analysis''. The grammar (ranking of constraints) of the language determines which of the candidates will be assessed as optimal by {{sc1|Eval}}.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|p=20}}

=={{sc1|Con}}: the constraint set==
In Optimality Theory, every constraint is universal. {{sc1|Con}} is the same in every language. There are two basic types of constraints:

* Faithfulness constraints require that the observed surface form (the output) match the underlying or lexical form (the input) in some particular way; that is, these constraints require identity between input and output forms.
* Markedness constraints impose requirements on the structural [[well-formedness]] of the output.

Each plays a crucial role in the theory. Markedness constraints motivate changes from the underlying form, and faithfulness constraints prevent every input from being realized as some completely unmarked form (such as {{IPA|[ba]}}).

The universal nature of {{sc1|Con}} makes some immediate predictions about language typology. If grammars differ only by having different rankings of {{sc1|Con}}, then the set of possible human languages is determined by the constraints that exist. Optimality Theory predicts that there cannot be more grammars than there are permutations of the ranking of {{sc1|Con}}. The number of possible rankings is equal to the [[factorial]] of the total number of constraints, thus giving rise to the term ''factorial typology''. However, it may not be possible to distinguish all of these potential grammars, since not every constraint is guaranteed to have an observable effect in every language. Two total orders on the constraints of {{sc1|Con}} could generate the same range of input–output mappings, but differ in the relative ranking of two constraints which do not conflict with each other. Since there is no way to distinguish these two rankings they are said to belong to the same grammar. A grammar in OT is equivalent to an [[antimatroid]] (Merchant &amp; Riggle 2016). If rankings with ties are allowed, then the number of possibilities is an [[ordered Bell number]] rather than a factorial, allowing a significantly larger number of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review: The Best of All Possible Words (review of ''Optimality Theory: An Overview'', Archangeli, Diana &amp; Langendoen, D. Terence, eds., Blackwell, 1997)|first1=T. Mark|last1=Ellison|first2=Ewan|last2=Klein|journal=Journal of Linguistics|volume=37|issue=1|year=2001|pages=127–143|jstor=4176645}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faithfulness constraints===
McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995) propose three basic families of faithfulness constraints:

* {{sc1|Max}} prohibits [[elision|deletion]] (from "maximal").
* {{sc1|Dep}} prohibits [[epenthesis]] (from "dependent").
* {{sc1|Ident}}(F) prohibits alteration to the value of feature F (from "identical").

Each of the constraints' names may be suffixed with "-IO" or "-BR", standing for ''input/output'' and ''base/reduplicant'', respectively—the latter of which is used in analysis of [[reduplication]]—if desired. ''F'' in {{sc1|Ident}}(F) is substituted by the name of a [[distinctive feature]], as in {{sc1|Ident-IO}}(voice).

{{sc1|Max}} and {{sc1|Dep}} replace {{sc1|Parse}} and {{sc1|Fill}} proposed by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993), which stated "underlying segments must be parsed into syllable structure" and "syllable positions must be filled with underlying segments", respectively.{{sfnp|Prince|Smolensky|1993|p=94}}{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=27}} {{sc1|Parse}} and {{sc1|Fill}} serve essentially the same functions as {{sc1|Max}} and {{sc1|Dep}}, but differ in that they evaluate only the output and not the relation between the input and output, which is rather characteristic of markedness constraints.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=209}} This stems from the model adopted by Prince &amp; Smolensky known as ''containment theory'', which assumes the input segments unrealized by the output are not removed but rather "left unparsed" by a syllable.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=99–100}} The model put forth by McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995, 1999), known as ''correspondence theory'', has since replaced it as the standard framework.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=27}}

McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995) also propose:

* {{sc1|I-Contig}}, violated when a word- or morpheme-internal segment is deleted (from "input-contiguity");
* {{sc1|O-Contig}}, violated when a segment is inserted word- or morpheme-internally (from "output-contiguity");
* {{sc1|Linearity}}, violated when the order of some segments is changed (i.e. prohibits [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]);
* {{sc1|Uniformity}}, violated when two or more segments are realized as one (i.e. prohibits [[fusion (linguistics)|fusion]]); and
* {{sc1|Integrity}}, violated when a segment is realized as multiple segments (i.e. prohibits [[unpacking]] or [[vowel breaking]]—opposite of {{sc1|Uniformity}}).

===Markedness constraints===
Markedness constraints introduced by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993) include:

{| class="wikitable"

| {{sc1|Nuc}}
| Syllables must have nuclei.
|
|-
| {{sc1|&amp;minus;Coda}}

| {{sc1|NoCoda}}
|-
| {{sc1|Ons}}
| Syllables must have onsets.
| {{sc1|Onset}}
|-
| {{sc1|HNuc}}
| A nuclear segment must be more [[Sonority hierarchy|sonorous]] than another (from "harmonic nucleus").
|
|-
| {{sc1|*Complex}}
| A syllable must be V, CV or VC.
|
|-
| {{sc1|CodaCond}}
| Coda consonants cannot have place features that are not shared by an onset consonant.
| {{sc1|CodaCondition}}
|-
| {{sc1|NonFinality}}
| A word-final syllable (or [[foot (prosody)|foot]]) must not bear stress.
| {{sc1|NonFin}}
|-
| {{sc1|FtBin}}
| A foot must be two syllables (or [[Mora  (linguistics)|moras]]).
| {{sc1|FootBinarity}}
|-
| {{sc1|Pk-Prom}}
| Light syllables must not be stressed.
| {{sc1|PeakProminence}}
|-
| WSP
| Heavy syllables must be stressed (from "weight-to-stress principle").
| {{sc1|Weight-to-Stress}}
|}

Precise definitions in literature vary. Some constraints are sometimes used as a "cover constraint", standing in for a set of constraints that are not fully known or important.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=224}}

Some markedness constraints are context-free and others are context-sensitive. For example, *V&lt;sub&gt;nasal&lt;/sub&gt; states that vowels must not be nasal in any position and is thus context-free, whereas *V&lt;sub&gt;oral&lt;/sub&gt;N states that vowels must not be oral when preceding a tautosyllabic nasal and is thus context-sensitive.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=29–30}}

===Alignment constraints===
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}

===Local conjunctions===
Two constraints may be conjoined as a single constraint, called a ''local conjunction'', which gives only one violation each time both constraints are violated within a given domain, such as a segment, syllable or word. For example, [{{sc1|NoCoda &amp; VOP}}]&lt;sub&gt;segment&lt;/sub&gt; is violated once per voiced [[obstruent]] in a coda ("VOP" stands for "voiced obstruent prohibition"), and may be equivalently written as {{sc1|*VoicedCoda}}.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=392–400}}{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|pp=214–20}} Local conjunctions are used as a way of circumventing the problem of [[phonological opacity]] that arises when analyzing [[chain shift]]s.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=392–400}}

=={{sc1|Eval}}: definition of optimality==
Given two candidates, A and B, A is better, or more "harmonic", than B on a constraint if A incurs fewer violations than B. Candidate A is more harmonic than B on an entire constraint hierarchy if A incurs fewer violations of the highest-ranked constraint distinguishing A and B. A is "optimal" in its candidate set if it is better on the constraint hierarchy than all other candidates.

For example, given the constraints C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dominates C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which dominates C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), A is optimal if it does better than B on the highest ranking constraint which assigns them a different number of violations. If A and B tie on C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but A does better than B on C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A is optimal, even if A has however many more violations of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; than B does. This comparison is often illustrated with a tableau. The [[index (typography)|pointing finger]] marks the optimal candidate, and each cell displays an asterisk for each violation for a given candidate and constraint. Once a candidate does worse than another candidate on the highest ranking constraint distinguishing them, it incurs a fatal violation (marked in the tableau by an exclamation mark and by shaded cells for the lower-ranked constraints). Once a candidate incurs a fatal violation, it cannot be optimal, even if it outperforms the other candidates on the rest of {{sc1|Con}}.

Other notational conventions include dotted lines separating columns of unranked or equally ranked constraints, a check mark ✔ in place of a finger in tentatively ranked tableaux (denoting harmonic but not conclusively optimal), and a circled asterisk ⊛ denoting a violation by a winner; in output candidates, the angle brackets {{angle bracket|&amp;nbsp;}} denote segments elided in phonetic realization, and □ and □́ denote an epenthetic consonant and vowel, respectively.{{sfnp|Tesar|Smloensky|1998|pp=230–1, 239}} The "much greater than" sign ≫ (sometimes the nested ⪢) denotes the domination of a constraint over another ("C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;" = "C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dominates C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;") while the "succeeds" operator ≻ denotes superior harmony in comparison of output candidates ("A ≻ B" = "A is more harmonic than B").{{sfnp|McCarthy|2001|p=247}}

Constraints are ranked in a hierarchy of strict domination. The ''strictness of strict domination'' means that a candidate which violates only a high-ranked constraint does worse on the hierarchy than one that does not, even if the second candidate fared worse on every other lower-ranked constraint. This also means that constraints are violable; the winning (i.e. the most harmonic) candidate need not satisfy all constraints, as long as for any rival candidate that does better than the winner on some constraint, there is a higher-ranked constraint on which the winner does better than that rival. Within a language, a constraint may be ranked high enough that it is always obeyed; it may be ranked low enough that it has no observable effects; or, it may have some intermediate ranking. The term ''the emergence of the unmarked'' describes situations in which a markedness constraint has an intermediate ranking, so that it is violated in some forms, but nonetheless has observable effects when higher-ranked constraints are irrelevant.

An early example proposed by McCarthy &amp; Prince (1994) is the constraint {{sc1|NoCoda}}, which prohibits syllables from ending in consonants. In [[Balangao]], {{sc1|NoCoda}} is not ranked high enough to be always obeyed, as witnessed in roots like ''taynan'' (faithfulness to the input prevents deletion of the final {{IPA|/n/}}). But, in the [[reduplication|reduplicated]] form ''ma-tayna-taynan'' 'repeatedly be left behind', the final {{IPA|/n/}} is not copied. Under McCarthy &amp; Prince's analysis, this is because faithfulness to the input does not apply to reduplicated material, and {{sc1|NoCoda}} is thus free to prefer ''ma-tayna-taynan'' over hypothetical ''ma-taynan-taynan'' (which has an additional violation of {{sc1|NoCoda}}).

Some optimality theorists prefer the use of comparative tableaux, as described in Prince (2002b). Comparative tableaux display the same information as the classic or "flyspeck" tableaux, but the information is presented in such a way that it highlights the most crucial information. For instance, the tableau above would be rendered in the following way.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Comparative tableau
! !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 1 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 2 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 3
|-
! A ~ B
| e || W || L
|}

Each row in a comparative tableau represents a winner–loser pair, rather than an individual candidate. In the cells where the constraints assess the winner–loser pairs, "W" is placed if the constraint in that column prefers the winner, "L" if the constraint prefers the loser, and "e" if the constraint does not differentiate between the pair. Presenting the data in this way makes it easier to make generalizations. For instance, in order to have a consistent ranking ''some'' W must dominate ''all'' L's. Brasoveanu and Prince (2005) describe a process known as fusion and the various ways of presenting data in a comparative tableau in order to achieve the necessary and sufficient conditions for a given argument.

==Example==
As a simplified example, consider the manifestation of the English plural:

* {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/ → [dɒɡz]}} (''dogs'')
* {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/ → [kæts]}} (''cats'')
* {{IPA|/dɪʃ/ + /z/ → [dɪʃɪz]}} (''dishes'')

Also consider the following constraint set, in descending order of domination:

{| class="wikitable"
! Type !! Name !! Description
|-
| rowspan="2" | Markedness || *SS || Two successive sibilants are prohibited. One violation for every pair of adjacent [[sibilants]] in the output.
|-
| {{sc1|Agree}}(Voice) || Output segments agree in specification of [[Distinctive feature|&amp;#91;±voice&amp;#93;]]. One violation for every pair of adjacent [[obstruent]]s in the output which disagree in voicing.
|-
| rowspan="3" | Faithfulness || {{sc1|Max}} || Maximizes all input segments in the output. One violation for each segment in the input that does not appear in the output. This constraint prevents deletion.
|-
| {{sc1|Dep}} || Output segments are dependent on having an input correspondent. One violation for each segment in the output that does not appear in the input. This constraint prevents insertion.
|-
| {{sc1|Ident}}(Voice) || Maintains the identity of the [±voice] specification. One violation for each segment that differs in voicing between the input and output.

No matter how the constraints are re-ordered, the allomorph {{IPA|[ɪs]}} will always lose to {{IPA|[ɪz]}}. This is called ''harmonic bounding''. The violations incurred by the candidate {{IPA|[dɒɡɪz]}} are a subset of the violations incurred by {{IPA|[dɒɡɪs]}}; specifically, if you epenthesize a vowel, changing the voicing of the morpheme is a gratuitous violation of constraints. In the {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/}} tableau, there is a candidate {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} which incurs no violations whatsoever. Within the constraint set of the problem, {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} harmonically bounds all other possible candidates. This shows that a candidate does not need to be a winner in order to harmonically bound another candidate.

The tableaux from above are repeated below using the comparative tableaux format.

From the comparative tableau for {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/}}, it can be observed that any ranking of these constraints will produce the observed output {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}}. Because there are no loser-preferring comparisons, {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} wins under any ranking of these constraints; this means that no ranking can be established on the basis of this input.

The tableau for {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/}} contains rows with a single W and a single L. This shows that {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Max}}, and {{sc1|Dep}} must all dominate {{sc1|Ident}}; however, no ranking can be established between those constraints on the basis of this input. Based on this tableau, the following ranking has been established
: {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Max}}, {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}.

The tableau for {{IPA|/dɪʃ/ + /z/}} shows that several more rankings are necessary in order to predict the desired outcome. The first row says nothing; there is no loser-preferring comparison in the first row. The second row reveals that either *SS or {{sc1|Agree}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}, based on the comparison between {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} and {{IPA|[dɪʃz]}}. The third row shows that {{sc1|Max}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. The final row shows that either *SS or {{sc1|Ident}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. From the {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/}} tableau, it was established that {{sc1|Dep}} dominates {{sc1|Ident}}; this means that *SS must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}.

So far, the following rankings have been shown to be necessary:
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}} ≫ {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}

While it is possible that {{sc1|Agree}} can dominate {{sc1|Dep}}, it is not necessary; the ranking given above is sufficient for the observed for {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} to emerge.

When the rankings from the tableaux are combined, the following ranking summary can be given:
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}} ≫ {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}
::or
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}}, {{sc1|Agree}} ≫ {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}

There are two possible places to put {{sc1|Agree}} when writing out rankings linearly; neither is truly accurate. The first implies that *SS and {{sc1|Max}} must dominate {{sc1|Agree}}, and the second implies that {{sc1|Agree}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. Neither of these are truthful, which is a failing of writing out rankings in a linear fashion like this. These sorts of problems are the reason why most linguists utilize a [[Lattice (order)|lattice graph]] to represent necessary and sufficient rankings, as shown below.

[[File:Lattice 2.jpg|Lattice graph of necessary and sufficient rankings]]

A diagram that represents the necessary rankings of constraints in this style is a [[Hasse diagram]].

==Criticism==
Optimality Theory has attracted substantial amounts of criticism, most of which is directed at its application to phonology (rather than syntax or other fields).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dresher (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hale &amp; Reiss (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halle (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idsardi (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idsardi (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed that Optimality Theory cannot account for [[phonological opacity]] (see Idsardi 2000, for example). In derivational phonology, effects that are inexplicable at the surface level but are explainable through "opaque" rule ordering may be seen; but in Optimality Theory, which has no intermediate levels for rules to operate on, these effects are difficult to explain.

For example, in [[Quebec French]], high front vowels triggered affrication of {{IPA|/t/}}, (e.g. {{IPA|/tipik/ → [tˢpɪk]}}), but the loss of high vowels (visible at the surface level) has left the affrication with no apparent source. Derivational phonology can explain this by stating that vowel [[syncope (phonology)|syncope]] (the loss of the vowel) "counterbled" affrication—that is, instead of vowel syncope occurring and "[[bleeding order|bleeding]]" (i.e. preventing) affrication, it says that affrication applies before vowel syncope, so that the high vowel is removed and the environment destroyed which had triggered affrication. Such counterbleeding rule orderings are therefore termed ''opaque'' (as opposed to ''transparent''), because their effects are not visible at the surface level.

The opacity of such phenomena finds no straightforward explanation in Optimality Theory, since intermediate forms are not accessible (constraints refer only to the surface form and/or the underlying form). There have been a number of proposals designed to account for it, but most of the proposals significantly alter Optimality Theory's basic architecture and therefore tend to be highly controversial. Frequently, such alterations add new types of constraints (which are not universal faithfulness or markedness constraints), or change the properties of {{sc1|Gen}} (such as allowing for serial derivations) or {{sc1|Eval}}. Examples of these include [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John J. McCarthy]]'s sympathy theory and candidate chains theory, among many others.

A relevant issue is the existence of circular [[chain shift]]s, i.e. cases where input {{IPA|/X/}} maps to output {{IPA|[Y]}}, but input {{IPA|/Y/}} maps to output {{IPA|[X]}}. Many versions of Optimality Theory predict this to be impossible (see Moreton 2004, Prince 2007).

Optimality Theory is also criticized as being an impossible model of speech production/perception: computing and comparing an infinite number of possible candidates would take an infinitely long time to process. Idsardi (2006) argues this position, though other linguists dispute this claim on the grounds that Idsardi makes unreasonable assumptions about the constraint set and candidates, and that more moderate instantiations of Optimality Theory do not present such significant [[computational problem]]s (see Kornai (2006) and Heinz, Kobele &amp; Riggle (2009)). Another common rebuttal to this criticism of Optimality Theory is that the framework is purely representational. In this view, Optimality Theory is taken to be a model of [[linguistic competence]] and is therefore not intended to explain the specifics of [[linguistic performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Kager, René (1999). Optimality Theory. Section 1.4.4: Fear of infinity, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Alan and Paul Smolensky. (2004): ''Optimality Theory: Constraint Interaction in Generative Grammar''. Section 10.1.1: Fear of Optimization, pp. 215–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection to Optimality Theory is that it is not technically a theory, in that it does not make falsifiable predictions. The source of this issue may be in terminology: the term ''theory'' is used differently here than in physics, chemistry, and other sciences. Specific instantiations of Optimality Theory may make falsifiable predictions, in the same way specific proposals within other linguistic frameworks can. What predictions are made, and whether they are testable, depends on the specifics of individual proposals (most commonly, this is a matter of the definitions of the constraints used in an analysis). Thus, Optimality Theory as a framework is best described{{according to whom|date=June 2018}} as a [[scientific paradigm]].&lt;ref&gt;de Lacy (editor). (2007). ''The Cambridge Handbook of Phonology'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories within Optimality Theory==
In practice, implementations of Optimality Theory often assume other related concepts, such as the [[syllable]], the [[mora (linguistics)|mora]], or [[feature geometry]]. Completely distinct from these, there are sub-theories which have been proposed entirely within Optimality Theory, such as [[positional faithfulness theory]], correspondence theory (McCarthy &amp; Prince 1995), sympathy theory, and a number of theories of learnability, most notably by [[Bruce Tesar]].
There are also a range of theories specifically about Optimality Theory. These are concerned with issues like the possible formulations of constraints, and constraint interactions other than strict domination.

==Use outside of phonology==
Optimality Theory is most commonly associated with the field of [[phonology]], but has also been applied to other areas of linguistics. [[Jane Grimshaw]], [[Geraldine Legendre]] and [[Joan Bresnan]] have developed instantiations of the theory within [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, John (2001). A Thematic Guide to Optimality Theory, Chapter 4: Connections of Optimality Theory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legendre, Grimshaw &amp; Vikner (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Optimality theoretic approaches are also relatively prominent in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (and the morphology–phonology interface in particular).&lt;ref&gt;Trommer (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Orangery Palace''' ({{lang-de|Orangerieschloss}}) is a palace located in the [[Sanssouci Park]] of [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]]. also known as the '''New [[Orangery]] on the Klausberg''', or just the '''Orangery'''.  It was built on behest of the "Romantic on the Throne", King Friedrich Wilhelm IV ([[Frederick William IV of Prussia]]) from 1851 to 1864.

==Background==
[[Image:Potsdam - Sanssouci - Orangery - around 1900.jpg|thumb|left|The Orangery Palace around 1900]]
[[Image:Potsdam Orangerie.jpg|thumb|200px|The Orangery]]
The building of the Orangery began with a plan for a high street or triumph street.  It was to begin at the triumph arch, east of [[Sanssouci Park]], and end at the [[Belvedere on the Klausberg]]. The difference in elevation was to be balanced with [[viaduct]]s.

With reference to the north side of the [[Sanssouci Picture Gallery|Picture Gallery]] and the [[The New Chambers at Sanssouci|New Chambers]] from the time of [[Frederick the Great]], Frederick William IV sketched out more new buildings, which would decorate his two kilometer long ''Via Tiumphalis''.

Because of the political unrest of the period ([[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]]) and lack of funding, the gigantic project never materialized. Only the Orangery Palace and the ''Triumphtor'' were ever realized.

==The Palace==
[[Image:Potsdam orangerieschloss 2.jpg|thumb|200px|The Orangery]]
The construction of the Orangery Palace began after preliminary drawings by Frederick William IV. The architects [[Friedrich August Stüler]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse|de}} were commissioned to turn the drawings into a reality.

The building, with its 300 meter long front, was built [[Renaissance Revival architecture|in the style of the Italian Renaissance]], after the image of the [[Villa Medici]] in Rome and the [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]].

The middle building with its twin towers is the actual palace. This building is joined to the 103 meter long and 16 meter wide Plant Hall, with its almost ceiling-to-floor windows on the south side. In the western hall, the original floor duct heating system is still present and functioning. In the [[alcove (architecture)|alcove]]s along the garden side of the castle annex, there are [[allegory|allegorical]] figures of the months and seasons. In the corner building at the end of the Orangery Hall were the royal apartments and the servants' quarters.

In front of the [[peristyle]] [[Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria|Elisabeth]], Frederick William IV's wife, had a statue of the king erected ''in Memoriam'' after his death in 1861.

==Orangery interior==
[[Image:OrangeryInterior.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Interior of the Orangery]]
Behind the portico, in the middle building, lies the over two-story-tall [[Raffael|Raffael Hall]]. It was based on the ''[[Sala Regia (Vatican)|Sala Regia]]'' in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Over a large skylight in the high clouded ceiling, light falls into the Museum Hall. On the red silk covered walls, hang over fifty copies of [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] paintings. Frederick William IV inherited the images from his father, King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]], and assembled them here.

The royal apartments were outfitted in the second [[Rococo]] style, connected to both sides of the Raffael Hall. They were intended as guest rooms for [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] and his wife, [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Alexandra Feodorovna]]. The [[Tsarina]] was the favorite sister of Frederick William IV, Charlotte, who gave up her name along with her homeland when she married.

Between 1949 and 2010 the Palace also housed premises of the [[Brandenburgisches Landeshauptarchiv|Brandenburgian State Main Archive]] in its eastern wing.

==Garden construction==
[[Image:Karte Orangerie.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Klausberg around 1900]]
The gardens were styled after those of the Italian Renaissance by the garden architect, [[Peter Joseph Lenné]]. In the west, below the annex, he designed the Paradise Garden in 1843/1844. It contains many exotic flowers and foliage plants. The [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], a small building in middle of the compound, designed in the ancient style, was built on plans by [[Ludwig Persius]] in 1845. The current Botanical Garden, with its systematically arranged planting, is used by the [[University of Potsdam]] as a ''teaching garden''.

The [[Nordic countries|Norse]] and [[Sicily|Sicilian]] Gardens lie to the east. These completely different garden sections were laid out by Lenné between 1857 and 1860. The dark, effective Norse Garden, with its pines, was to have been an element of the planned triumph street.

The Sicilian Garden, with its palm tubs, [[Myrtus|myrtles]], [[Bay Laurel|laurel]]s, flowers, [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s, and fountains, runs southward.

==World Heritage Site==
Since 1990, the Orangery has been part of the UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] "[[Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin]]". The palace is administered by the ''[[Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg|Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg]]''.

'''Overpass Light Brigade''' (OLB) is an activist collaborative [[public art]] project based in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], and organized by American artists [[Lane Hall (artist)|Lane Hall]] and [[Lisa Moline]] and photographer [[Joe Brusky]]. The artwork is an episodic [[performance art|performance]] originally created as part of the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]] to raise awareness about the campaign to recall Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]].&lt;ref name=MLS&gt;{{cite web|last=Schumacher|first=Mary Louise|title=Overpass Light Brigade Targets Scott Walker|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/143260066.html?ipad=y#!page=3&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst|website=Art City |publisher=JSOnline|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; OLB was co-founded by Hall and Moline. Brusky, a [[community organizer]] and co-founder of [[occupy movement|Occupy]] [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Riverwest|Riverwest]], soon joined the project and facilitated its continued growth and social media presence.&lt;ref name=spark&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Pat|title=Overpass Light Brigade's illuminated protest signs spark a national network|url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/pat_schneider/overpass-light-brigade-s-illuminated-protest-signs-spark-a-national/article_43ea3818-751c-56d5-90c3-c09ef97f28bb.html|website=The Capital Times|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The artwork consists of a series of [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]-illuminated plastic panels, each of which displays one letter of the alphabet. Performers, known as "holders of the light," assemble in a line with each person holding one letter.&lt;ref name=Palermos&gt;{{cite web|title=Striking Palermo's Workers to Join Overpass Light Brigade for Historic Bridge Action|url=http://occupyriverwest.com/news/olb-stands-in-solidarity|publisher=occupyriverwest|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; OLB performances present timely messages or political slogans. The Overpass Light Brigade performs at night to increase visibility.

==History==
Hall and Moline developed the idea for the Overpass Light Brigade through their personal reactions to the movement to recall Governor Walker. They originally used a single panel and string of [[Christmas lights]] to create an illuminated "Recall Walker" sign, which they carried at a local rally.&lt;ref name=Maddow&gt;{{cite web|last=Maddow|first=Rachel|title=Wreckoning|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dsGYRR_jeI|website=The Rachel Maddow Show|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When images of the sign were circulated by [[mainstream media]] outlets including ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]''&lt;ref name="OnMilwaukee"/&gt; and [[CNN]],&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web|last=Welch|first=Chris|title=Crunch time for recall volunteers|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/03/politics/wisconsin-recall-bus-tour/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall and Moline decided to continue their efforts. Their next step was to create six individual signs that spelled "RECALL". After attempting to install the signs on the [[chainlink fence]] covering a pedestrian bridge across the [[Interstate 43|Interstate (I-43)]] and learning that doing so is illegal, Hall and Moline enlisted others to help carry the signs as a legal form of display. This participatory dimension to the work gives Overpass Light Brigade gatherings "the feel of a celebration, with scores of people gathering on the pedestrian overpasses," according to the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]''.&lt;ref name="Miner"/&gt;

For the artists, their work with the Overpass Light Brigade is a "demonstration of citizen engagement... a Situationist paradigm of performativity within the contested and liminal zones of public space"&lt;ref name="Building Movement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overpass Light Brigade, the Law, and Building a Movement|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/05/19/1093036/-Overpass-Light-Brigade-the-Law-and-Building-a-Movement|website=Daily Kos|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a navigation of the tactics of visibility.&lt;ref name="Bridge Parties"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin's Overpass Light Brigade and Drive by Seeing|url= http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/03/31/1079614/-Wisconsin-s-Overpass-Light-Brigade-Bridge-Parties-and-Drive-by-Seeing|website=Daily Kos|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cite French [[Spectacle (critical theory)|critical theorist]] [[Guy Debord]]'s  ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' as an inspiration.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Debord explored and explained how contemporary media creates spectacle that is essentially devoid of content. A founder of the artistic and political movement [[Situationist International]], he sought, through the construction of "situations," to create multiple strategies for reclaiming an individual's self-determination from the sedative effects of ubiquitous spectacle.&lt;ref name="Mythic Tractors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mythic Tractors March on Madison|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/03/13/955895/-Mythic-Tractors-March-On-Madison|website=Daily Kos|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall and Moline had a history of making collaborative work, often about environmental issues and animal subjects, but rarely pushed beyond the boundaries of traditional art spaces.&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite web|last=Stern|first=Nathaniel|title=The Overpass Light Brigade: Art + Electronics in the Wisconsin Uprising|url=http://www.furtherfield.org/features/interviews/overpass-light-brigade-art-electronics-wisconsin-uprising|website=Furtherfield|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Wisconsin protests, the artists became involved with activist work, in which the use of signs was pivotal. They also worked with other artists, activists, social scientists, and teachers to set up a short-lived [[political action committee]] called the Playground Legends, and began working in some of Milwaukee's African American communities on [[voter turnout|voter education]] and [[Get Out The Vote]] campaigns.&lt;ref name="Bridge Parties"/&gt; The group, with the central notion that [[public space]] and [[public discourse]] were necessary for functional democracy, set up "parties in the parks" for neighborhood groups, and used these relational activities to help create cohesion around a political purpose.&lt;ref name="Summertime Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Activist Manifesto or Hot Fun in the Summertime|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/06/25/988764/-An-Activist-Manifesto-or-Hot-Fun-In-the-Summertime|website=Daily Kos|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affiliated Light Brigade organizations have been established in cities across the United States and internationally, and have organized to form the Light Brigade Network.&lt;ref name="spark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Light Brigade Network|url=https://www.facebook.com/LightBrigadeNetwork|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}{{Primary source inline|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="troublenet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overpass Light Brigade &amp; the Light Brigade Network|url=http://beautifultrouble.org/practitioner/overpass-light-brigade-light-brigade-network/|website=Beautiful Trouble: A Toolbox for Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall emphasizes the importance for groups to consider how a collection of lighted letters can be recombined; to document the action through quality (night-time) photographs, videos, and blog posts; and to use social media to amplify the reach of the message.&lt;ref name="troubleOLB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Light Brigade|url=http://beautifultrouble.org/tactic/light-brigade/|website=Beautiful Trouble|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Light Brigade Network includes 46 chapters in cities in 21 US states, and six chapters in [[Croatia]], France, (Germany), [[New Zealand]], and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="OLBnetwork"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overpass Light Brigade Network|url=http://overpasslightbrigade.org/network/|website=Overpass Light Brigade|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zagreb Light Brigade|url=ps://www.facebook.com/zagreblightbrigade/|website=Facebook Community Page|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Light Brigade Network actions==
Light Brigade groups organize actions around issues pertinent to their communities, and often collaborate on larger, national or international campaigns. Some noteworthy actions include:

* On April 10, 2014, the PEN American Center organized an event protesting China’s efforts to silence [[Ai Weiwei]] and other Chinese artists and writers. This event featured 
the NYC Light Brigade, holding lighted signs spelling "FREE EXPRESSION" in English and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schumacher|first1=Mary Louise|title=Overpass Light Brigade, started in Milwaukee, part of free speech protest|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/arts/ai-weiwei-addresses-china-at-brooklyn-museum-b99245816z1-254916451.html|accessdate=March 9, 2016|agency=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PEN American Center Defies Chinese Government, Brings Ai Weiwei to New York|url=http://www.pen.org/press-release/2014/04/11/pen-american-center-defies-chinese-government-brings-ai-weiwei-new-york|website=PEN America|publisher=PEN America|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On January 7, 2015 after the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, what has become the Paris Light Brigade brought lights spelling "NOT AFRAID" to a vigil in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not Afraid : "Ça nous paraissait important d'exprimer un message universel"|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2015/01/08/not-afraid-ca-nous-paraissait-important-d-exprimer-un-message-universel_1176232|website=Liberation|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlie Hebdo attack vigils – in pictures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2015/jan/07/charlie-hebdo-attack-vigils-in-pictures|accessdate=March 9, 2016|work=The Guardian|date=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Throughout December 2015, homes and businesses in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn displayed signs as part of "Mi Casa Es No Su Casa: Illumination Against Gentrification.” This project was a collaboration between local activists, the Mayday Space and NYC Light Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fishbein|first1=Rebecca|title=Bushwick Woman Fights Gentrification With Christmas Lights: "Your Luxury Is Our Displacement"|url=http://gothamist.com/2015/12/29/bushwick_gentrification_lights.php|accessdate=March 9, 2016|publisher=Gothamist|date=December 29, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301163206/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/29/bushwick_gentrification_lights.php|archivedate=March 1, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Activists in Bushwick Hope to Illuminate Gentrification|url=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2015/12/24/activists-in-bushwick-hope-to-illuminate-neighborhood-s-gentrification.html|accessdate=March 9, 2016|publisher=NY1 News|date=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Chicago Light Brigade has been involved in numerous projects – on their own and in collaboration with other groups – to promote social justice for communities of color. They participated in the Week of Action Against Incarcerating Youth (May 2014) with the "Locked Up and Out" Rally, and protested the police shooting of Laquan McDonald in December 2015 with the "Memorial Blockade" in downtown Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chicago Protest Against Cop-Involved Shooting Blocks Traffic|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Chicago-Protest-Against-Cop-Involved-Shooting-Blocks-Traffic-362576521.html|accessdate=March 9, 2016|agency=NBC Chicago|publisher=NBCUniversal Media, LLC|date=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayes|first1=Kelly|title=Memorial Blockade: A Love Letter to Communities Resisting Police Violence|url=http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/34144-memorial-blockade-a-love-letter-to-communities-resisting-police-violence|website=Truthout|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Films==
The spectacle and "mediagenic quality" of OLB's actions have made it the subject of several film projects. ''Overpass Light Brigade'', a short documentary by filmmakers Matt Mullans and Dusan Harminc, was released in 2013 and was screened in over 25 venues, including Woods Hole Film Festival, Marfa Film Festival, and the PBS Online Film Festival.&lt;ref name="Forward Press Release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overpass Light Brigade (2014)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2766000/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overpass Light Brigade Screenings|url=http://www.olbfilm.com/screenings.html|website=Overpass Light Brigade The Film|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Overpass Light Brigade, short film by makers of Forward, shows in PBS Online Film Festival|url=http://urbanmilwaukee.com/pressrelease/overpass-light-brigade-short-film-by-makers-of-forward-shows-in-pbs-online-film-festival/|accessdate=March 9, 2016|publisher=Urban Milwaukee|date=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 PBS Online Film Festival|url=https://www.pbs.org/filmfestival/2014/|website=''pbs.org''|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, [[Planned Parenthood]], with 371 Productions and documentary filmmaker [[Brad Lichtenstein]], created the "Be Visible" campaign, with a video highlighting women's stories and featuring the Overpass Light Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Be Visible|url=https://vimeo.com/76162098|via=Vimeo|publisher=Planned Parenthood Saves Lives|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Be Visible|url=http://overpasslightbrigade.org/visible/|website=Overpass Light Brigade Blog|publisher=OLB|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="371Productions"&gt;{{cite web|title=371 Productions About Us|url=http://371productions.com/about-us/|website=371 Productions|publisher=371 Productions|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17690">'''Oxidizable carbon ratio dating''' is a method of [[Chronological dating|dating]] in [[archaeology]] and [[earth science]] that can be used to derive or estimate the age of soil and sediment samples up to 35,000 years old. The method is experimental, and it is not as widely used in [[archaeology]] as other [[chronometric]] methods such as [[radiocarbon dating]].

The methodology was introduced by Archaeology Consulting Team from [[Essex Junction]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="Frink, Douglas S. 1992"&gt;Frink, Douglas S. (1992) The Chemical Variability of Carbonized Organic Matter Through Time. ''Archaeology of Eastern North America'' 20: 67-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frink, Douglas S. (1994) The Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR): A Proposed Solution to Some of the Problems Encountered with Radiocarbon Data.  ''North American Archaeologist'' 15(1): 17-29 [http://baywood.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0197-6931&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frink, Douglas S. (1995) Application of the Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR) Dating Procedure and its Implications for Pedogenic Research.  In ''Pedological Perspectives in Archaeological Research''. SSA Special Publication 44. Soil Science Society of America: Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
This dating method works by measuring the ratio of oxidizable carbon to organic carbon. If the sample is freshly burned there will be no oxidizable carbon because it would have all been removed by the combustion process. Over time this will change and the amount of organic carbon will decrease to be replaced by oxidizable carbon. By measuring the ratio of oxidized carbon to organic carbon (the OCR) and applying it to the following equation the age of the sample can be determined with a very low [[standard error (statistics)|standard error]].&lt;ref name="Frink"&gt;Douglas S. Frink. [http://www.eprida.com/hydro/ecoss/background/applicationofocr.pdf "Application of the Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR) Dating Procedure and its Implications for Pedogenic Research".] Accessed November 2, 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{OCR}_\text{DATE} = \frac{\text{OCR} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Mean temperature} \times \text{Mean rainfall}}{\text{Mean texture} \times \sqrt\text{pH}\times\sqrt{\%C}\times 14.4888}&lt;/math&gt;

==Evaluations and applications of the method==
It is important to note that the OCR dating method is, like any scientific procedure, subject to testing, evaluation, and refinement.

The Oxidizable Carbon Ratio method was the subject of a Point–CounterPoint feature of the Society for American Archaeology Bulletin in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Killick, A. J. T. Jull, and G. S Burr [http://www.saa.org/Publications/saabulletin/17-5/saa18.html "A Failure to Discriminate: Querying Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR) Dating" and "The Scientific Basis of Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR) Dating"] Accessed December 8th, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In that article, Killick, Jull, and Burr suggest that the OCR method has (1) never been described in a peer-reviewed journal article, (2) that no "scientifically acceptable" demonstration of the accuracy and precision of OCR dating has been published, and (3) that the equation underlying the OCR method is questionable because of site-specific environmental factors.  Frink's rejoinder to these comments points out that (1) the OCR method has indeed been described in a peer-reviewed journal article,&lt;ref name="Frink, Douglas S. 1992"/&gt; (2) that the accuracy and precision of the method have been reported in multiple venues and that the concept of "scientifically acceptable" is context- and person-specific (and therefore a red herring), and that (3) the equation underlying the OCR method takes into account the seven factors of soil formation, and that these factors are routinely used in soil science applications without question.  In the end, Frink concludes that the OCR method—like any scientific advance—warrants further study, and he points out that even the now venerable "scientifically acceptable" method of radiocarbon dating was much maligned when it was first introduced.

Frink and others have published multiple studies demonstrating that OCR dates can correlate well with [[radiocarbon date]]s (see list of published references provided below).  Fullen's study of  the Sarah Peralta site in Louisiana &lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. Fullen (1998). [http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11162005-133233/unrestricted/Fullen_thesis.pdf  Temporal Trends in Tchula Period Pottery in Louisiana]. Pages 63-65. Accessed December 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; found that the OCR method served as an effective means of inferring time at the site in the absence of radiometrically dateable charcoal.  He concludes that whereas debate remains concerning the OCR procedure, "the well-corroborated dates that the LSU Museum of Natural Science has had returned on material processed with OCR and conventional radiocarbon dating...the dates returned on material from Zone 3 will be considered accurate until such time that OCR dating is proven invalid." (''ibid''. p.&amp;nbsp;65)

The OCR method has been used in a large number of archaeological and geomorphological studies, and an incomplete list of published references is provided below.   It has been used to evaluate soil development in a range of temperature regimes including arid,&lt;ref name="Harrison, Rodney 2000"&gt;Harrison, Rodney, and Frink, Douglas S.

'''Pierre Pica''' (born January 5, 1951), is a research associate (Chargé de Recherche) at the National Center for Scientific Research in [[Paris]]. Associated Professor with the Brain Institute of the [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte]], he is a specialist in [[theoretical linguistics]] and more specifically of comparative [[syntax]].

Dr. Pica has concentrated his research on the notion of parameters in linguistic. He has also shown that the respective properties of reflexive pronouns could be derived from their morphological properties. He is currently studying the distinction between the internal and external aspects of the Faculty of language and is also working on a fine grained distinction between [[Linguistic competence|competence]] and [[linguistic performance]].

Over the last twenty years, Pica has risen to prominence as a result of his work on [[Binding Theory]] &lt;ref&gt;Pierre Pica, (1987), "On the Nature of the Reflexivization Cycle", Proceedings of the North Eastern Linguistic Society 17, 2 (1987) 483-500&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[evidentiality]]. More recently he has been working on [[Mundurucu]] (an indigenous language spoken in Para (Brazil). He is currently collaborating with [[Stanislas Dehaene]] and [[Elizabeth Spelke]] in a study of numerical expressions and enumeration in [[Mundurucu]]. This research stresses the importance of these data for the study of the interaction of the Language Faculty and restricted set of pre-verbal 'core knowledge'.  This research which stresses the importance of the notion of culture gap, as defined by [[Kenneth Hale]] (1975)'s seminal work,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth L. Hale, (1975), "Gaps in grammar and Culture", in M. Dake Kinkade, Kenneth Hale &amp; [[Oswald Werner]] eds. Linguistic &amp; Anthropology : In honor of C.F. Voegelin, 1975, p. 295-315&lt;/ref&gt; stands in opposition to the hypothesis related to [[relativism]] as derived from [[Edward Sapir|Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf|Whorf]]  in that it tends to demonstrate that knowledge, even culture, can in part be reduced to a small set of universal principles and intuitions. The research has given rise to a series of publications in [[Science (journal)|Science magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;Pica, P, C Lemer, V Izard &amp; Dehaene, S. (2004), "Exact and approximate arithmetic in an Amazonian Indigene Group" Science, 306, pp. 499–503&lt;/ref&gt;

In archeology, a  '''racloir''', also known as ''racloirs sur talon'' (French for scraper on the platform), is a certain type of [[flint]] tool made by prehistoric peoples.
[[File:Raedera Atapuerca (TG11).jpg|left|thumb|'''Racloir''' from Galería (TG11) of [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]]]]
It is a type of side scraper distinctive of [[Mousterian]] assemblages. It is created from a flint [[lithic flake|flake]] and looks like a large [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]. As well as being used for scraping hides and bark, it may also have been used as a knife. Racloirs are most associated with the [[Neanderthal]] [[Mousterian]] [[archaeological industry|industry]]. These racloirs are retouched along the ridge between the striking platform and the dorsal face. They have shaped edges and are modified by abrupt flaking from the dorsal face.

'''Rights-based approach to development''' is an approach to development promoted by many [[List of development aid agencies|development agencies]] and [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) to achieve a positive transformation of power relations among the various development actors. This practice blurs the distinction between [[human rights]] and [[economic development]]. There are two stakeholder groups in rights-based development—the rights holders (who do not experience full rights) and the duty bearers (the institutions obligated to fulfill the holders' rights). Rights-based approaches aim at strengthening the capacity of duty bearers and empower the rights holders.{{sfn|Gneiting 2009|p=1}}

==History==

===Human rights into development discourse===
Human rights came into global discourse after the [[United Nations]] passed the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. This was the first global recognition that all humans are inherente United Nations endorsement of democracy had little to do with the UN's stance on development.{{sfn|Forsythe|1997|p=336}}  [[Human rights]] became one of the major debates between the West and Communist states during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Hamm|2001|p=1006}}  Cold War dichotomy of right versus left defined power of the state and of the individual in aspects of society based on political affiliation.{{sfn|Harris-Curtis|2003|p=559}}  The end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet bloc left Western values and ideas, which remains one of the main ideologies of the world.

Human rights organizations such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], used to focus primarily on documenting human rights violations on the civil and political level. No longer do these organizations focus solely on human rights violations, but also on social, economic, and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.hrw.org/en/node/75134 Our History]". Human Rights Watch.&lt;/ref&gt;  The evolution of human rights organizations and development organizations and the western idea that rights are asserted through responsibilities, duties, transparency, trust, and accountability have led to the development of the rights-based approach. In 1993 the UN held the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna; during this conference they developed the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], where they linked democracy, human rights, sustainability and development.{{sfn|Hamm|2001|p=1007}}  This made the [[Cold War]] division of Civil and Political Rights and Economic Social and Cultural rights interdependent. This further led to the linkage between [[human rights]] and [[Economic development|development]] and enabled policy makers and developers to incorporate a rights-based approach into their policies.

In 1997, the Secretary General to the United Nations called to mainstream [[human rights]] into all work of the [[United Nations]]. Then in 2003, various organizations and agencies met to develop a "Common Understanding" of a human rights-based approach.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|pp=17–18}}  Giving six main principles:
* Universality and Inalienability
* Indivisibility
* Inter-Dependence and Inter-Relatedness
* Equality and Non-Discrimination
* Participation and Inclusion
* Accountability and Rule of Law

The [[United Nations]] developed this guide to address the significant changes occurring in the [[international development]] community with the adoption of human rights in development work. Since the UN published their standards and steps to a rights-based approach to development, many bilateral donor agencies, such as [[Canadian International Development Agency|CIDA]] and [[DFID]], and international NGOs such as [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] and [[Oxfam]] have taken similar steps.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=15}}

===Transition away from welfare model===
The [[Welfare state|welfare model]] has been rooted into Western developmental practices since the 20th century.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=270}}  In the welfare model, poverty is defined as the absence of a public good or knowledge. If the state or another vehicle, such as an NGO, provides the absent good, then poverty can be alleviated and development will occur.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=270}}  Billions of dollars have been poured into this approach, however despite some achievements there has not been success with this model. The gap between the rich and poor is widening and according to the ''World Development Report'', nearly half of the world's population live on less than $2 a day.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=270}}

This model lacks a way to hold governments accountable for their actions or inaction. It fails to address governments' inability to fulfill their citizens' rights either because of funding or knowledge. It also constructs the poor as objects of charity, predetermining their roles in civic society.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=271}}

Due to the failures of the [[welfare state|welfare model]], NGOs reevaluated and transitioned more towards a rights-based approach to development. In this model, instead of the poor being constructed as charity they would be constructed as actors or rights holders. The NGOs' role is to help the poor overcome obstacles blocking their rights and give governments the tools and training to provide these rights.

==Theories==

===Human rights===
The inclusion of human rights into development discourse has also brought along a certain language of rights. This brings a moral resonance to development rhetoric and makes it hard to avoid in today's discourse. Rights are defined as entitlements that belong to all human beings regardless of race, ethnicity, or socio-economic class;{{sfn|Nussbaum|1998|p=273}}  all humans, therefore, are rights holders, and it is someone’s duty to provide these rights. Who is responsible to give these rights, in other words the duty bearers, has been largely debated. In rights-based approach it is the person’s government that assumes the duty bearer position, but most of the time the said government does not have the resources to fulfill this role. This is where the NGOs come and try to help these governments fulfill their roles and duties to their people by giving them resources. These resources can be monetary or more sustainable such as training to government officials.

Currently there is an under-fulfillment of human rights, which has been directly linked with poverty.{{sfn|Pogge|2005|p=1}}  Poverty includes the assessment of standard of living, health, and well being. These are social and economic human rights,&lt;!-- It is a bit misleading to use the terms of first and second generation rights. It has been agreed in the Vienna declaration that Human Rights are Indivisible, Interdependent and Interrelated, and thus cannot be separated into a categorization of generations, which can lead people to interpret as first, second and third priorities. (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Declaration_and_Programme_of_Action#Human_Rights_as_Indivisible.2C_Interdependent_and_Interrelated)

Also, to elaborate, I quote the UN Chronicle (https://unchronicle.un.org/article/international-human-rights-law-short-history):
"After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it became generally accepted that such a dichotomy does not do justice to the extent to which these rights are interrelated and interdependent. The dichotomy of positive/negative obligations no longer holds water. It seems much more useful to regard all rights as interdependent and indivisible, and as potentially entailing a variety of obligations on the State. These obligations may be categorized as the duty to respect, protect, promote and fulfil."

I will therefore suggest that these terms are removed from this article. --&gt;which have just recently been included in development discourse.{{sfn|Sen|2004|p=316}}  First generation rights, or [[civil and political rights]], have dominated public policy in the past. However, with poverty on the rise and public policy failing, social and economic rights are becoming increasingly important in development of policies.

Affluent or rich countries feel they should help the poor out of charity or humanity.{{sfn|Pogge|2005|p=4}}  Rights-based approach works to shift the paradigm away from [[charity (virtue)|charity]] and towards moral duty imposed on the world through the international consensus of [[human rights]]. NGOs are adopting the “full spectrum” of human rights into their development policies. Using human rights as their driving force they are using rhetoric to develop a [[modus operandi]] that made political human rights effective.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003|p=2020}}

===Capacity building===
[[Capacity building]] is the ability of individuals, institutions, and societies to perform functions and solve problems.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=20}}  A goal of rights-based approach to development is to increase the capacity of both the duty bearers and the rights holders.

Key principles to increase capacity are sought to build upon existing capacities, ensure national engagement and ownership, and adjust to countries' needs as development occurs.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=21}}  In this method, the duty bearers and the rights holders both have an active role in development. The duty bearers are accountable for respecting, protecting, and fulfilling human rights; while the rights holders need to ask what they should do to help promote and defend their freedoms. This action keeps their governments accountable for creating sustainability.{{sfn|Sen|2004|p=339}}

Capacity building is an ongoing process, and is often [[Social capital|intangible]]. This is why many [[nonprofit organizations]] have not been able to engage or transition more towards capacity building. Donors like to see tangible results or they like to see where their money is going. Also the success of nonprofit and NGOs is shown through [[tangible]] results, leading organizations more toward service delivery than capacity building.

===International law===
The international recognition of human rights has been largely debated; there is acknowledgment but not institutional enforcement. NGOs that use a rights-based approach in policy decisions have a large problem with gaining legal status or enforcement of the human rights they are defending. They rely on publicly criticizing countries who make these violations.

There have been many international legal documents developed by the United Nations on behalf of human rights issues that all members of the UN have to abide by.

* [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|The Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)]]
* [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|The Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)]]
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|The Convention on Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD)]]
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|The Convention on Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)]]
* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|The Convention on Rights of the Child (CRC)]]
* [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|The Convention Against Torture (CAT)]]
* [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|The Convention on Migrant Workers and Their Families (MWC)]]

Since the 1948 adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] the international community has developed a legally binding framework for the protection of human rights. These legal documents have created norms and standards internationally.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|pp=2–3}}

===Social contract theory===
The [[social contract]] theory proclaims that rights such as [[life]], [[liberty]], and [[property]] belong to the individuals and not to society.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=276}}  These rights existed before individuals entered civil society and by entering [[civil society]], one is agreeing to a social contract. In this contract, the state has the right to enforce [[natural rights]]. The state breaks this contract if the rights of the people are broken or not secured. Today, social contracts come in the form of national constitutions, which provide rules explaining and protecting individual rights.

These rights are inherent, they are not granted by authority or any overriding principle. [[Human rights]] are recognized by all people making it universal and fundamental.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=277}}

===Downward accountability===
Within the realm of rights-based approach there is a theoretical relation to downward accountability in relation to [[Economic development|development]].  This theory states what the rights are, who deserves the rights and what actors are responsible for ensuring these rights are secured.  In development there is a focus on the responsibility of actors.  Therefore, in relation to downward accountability it creates a power dynamic in development aid.   NGDOs (non-governmental development organizations) focus on downward accountability to ensure the intended beneficiaries are being allowed their rights.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dwyer 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Since the mid-1990s there has been a trend for NGOs and development donor agencies to combine the idea of development and [[human rights]] into the human rights-based approach to development.  Although there has been an undertone of development within the association with human rights earlier than this time; it has been since the end of the 20th century when there were known links of combining development and human rights into the same efforts.  This practice includes NGOs that are geared towards development as well as human rights.  The donor agencies are now helping to fund this combination of human rights with development to become as effective as possible. Even human rights-based approach to development theories were involved with the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs).  MDGs are the goals set forth by the UN member states to work for the alleviation of extreme poverty, fighting of disease, and other global problems.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

There have been 3 growing trends in relation to NGOs and the rights-based approach to development that have been implemented into practice.  The first trend is focusing attention onto a rights-based approach to development.  The second trend is the joint advocacy by development NGOs and human rights NGOs to work together towards a common goal.  The third trend is to expand the attention to economic and social rights as well.  The Human Rights ideal imparts the international benchmark that states can have related and common ideas.  To have internationally understood human rights allows NGOs, governments, and corporations to be held accountable for their actions.  This change in focus on human rights-based approach to development challenges the market-dominated view that was popular during the 1980s into a view focused on the relationship between human rights and development.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003|p=2020}}

These new trends have a significant impact and a possible paradigm shift.  From looking at development as a gift turning to development as a human right puts the responsibility on the government.  However, this is not just the home country, the responsibility of development resides in the hands of wealthy countries as well. To switch to a rights-based approach to development would then lead to using internationally agreed upon human rights as a responsibility of governments to provide.  Within this theory development will no longer be viewed as a gift or a need, but rather a right that states and governments are held accountable for.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003}}

===NGOs, UN agencies, donor agencies and specific programs===

====NGOs involvement====

NGOs that have implemented rights-based approach to development have done so with four main principles to follow.  These principles are human rights-based approach design of their programs, [[education]] about rights-based approach, rights to participation, and accountability.  Human rights-based approach design of their programs begins with analysis of the unfulfilled [[human rights]].  It then commits programs and funds to fulfill these missing human rights.  The design of these programs also stresses that the donations are not a gift but rather that the people are finally receiving the human rights treatment they deserve.  Education of human rights and the programs that are being implemented is important.  The education is to inform the beneficiaries of their human rights as well as the ways in which NGOs and other organizations are attempting to increase their human rights.  Education is also to inform the governments, international organizations and donor agencies that are dealing with human rights their roles and responsibilities.  Then there is the principle of rights to participation.  This deals with the idea that beneficiaries should be included when implementing programs on their behalf.  Organizations should include the beneficiaries to help [[Empowerment|empower]].  Then there is the principle of accountability which is designed to have standards of human rights and development.  It is also designed for NGOs, international organizations, donor agencies and governments to be held to a higher standard of responsibility.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

[[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] are two NGOs that have been involved traditionally with advocacy in relation to human rights.  These NGOs have expanded from traditional political rights to expand to ESC rights, which includes economic and social rights as well.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

[[Oxfam]] is an NGO that has adopted the rights-based approach to development.  [[Oxfam]] vowed to continue to provide relief while also addressing the structural causes of poverty and injustice.  This approach combines poverty, human rights, development and trade all within the same realm.  [[Oxfam]] focuses a broad approach to the causes of poverty and injustice.  This NGO also would like to put economic and social justice at the top of the world agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Aaronson and Zimmerman, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The shift towards a rights-based approach to development forced [[Oxfam]] to reexamine its funding, a deeper examination into the state's role as a duty bearer, and using civil society as a vehicle for citizens to empowered to stand up for their rights. [[Oxfam]] also had to evaluate their development practices and business model.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003}}

There has been a shift from focusing upon civil human rights to human rights of social and economic areas.  There are many NGOs that are now focusing upon the ESC (economic and social rights) while creating and implementing programs.  [[Human Rights Watch]] is one of these NGOs that has implemented a focus on ESC rights.  These rights focus on alleviating poverty and implementing equal social and economic rights in all levels of society.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

NGOs that have implemented these ESC rights are focusing much of their attention on increasing the standard of living to be healthy and safe.  This includes ideas of [[water rights]] in areas that lack clean drinking water and health rights that include availability of medicine and doctors. This would increase the impoverished peoples' standard of living by increasing basic living needs and access.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

====International Development Agencies involvement====

Beginning in the late 1990s when rights-based approach to development began to be a popular discourse many aid donor agencies began to support this view towards development.  Their intentions are to implement support for programs to incorporate both development and human rights in an interdisciplinary fashion.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003}}

Major donor agencies that have adopted the rights-based approach to development include [[UNICEF]], [[UNDP]] (United Nations Development Program), UNFPA, ILO, Swedish Sida, Norwegian NOrad, British DFID, and the Australian aid agency.  Other UN programs have also adopted the rights-based approach to development.  This new development framework leads to moral legitimacy and social justice.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

[[UNDP]] The United Nations Development Program began in the late 1990s to raise awareness about this new rights-based approach viewpoint to development.  [[UNDP]] specifically focused upon the interactions of social and economic rights.  Their focus was to help develop policy decisions related to social and economic rights in association with development.  In 2000 [[UNDP]] published "Human Rights and Human Development" a document that provided their intentions and strategies based on their implementation of rights-based approach to development.  UNDP was also present at UN- sponsored conferences in relation to rights-based approach to development that included the UN Millennium Summit.  UNDP also provides tools for governments and donor agencies to support the rights-based approach to development.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003}}{{cite web |url=http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=847 |title=What is the Rights Based Approach all about? Perspectives from International Development Agencies |author=Celestine Nyamu-Musembi and Andrea Cornwall |date=2004 |work= |publisher=Institute of Development Studies |accessdate=July 10, 2012}}

[[UNICEF]] is another donor agency that has implemented the rights-based approach to development and its ideas.  UNICEF has a more narrow focus on women's and children's rights.  However, it has still implemented rights-based approach strategies with the programs UNICEF is helping to fund.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003}}

===Application of rights-based approach in NGOs===
NGOs transitioning to rights-based approach have to redefine missions, test new methodologies, reallocate funding, and train staff. To do this there are a few steps NGOs have to take in developing programs and campaigns around rights-based approach.

First, NGOs need to create program ideas. These are created based on an analysis of rights within a certain country. The analysis is necessary to identify and give priority to the most deprived in society. It is then the goal of a rights-based approach to empower those people. This step also identifies and reviews the [[capacity utilization|capacity]] of the duty-bearers. It also tries to understand the relationship between the rights holders and the duty bearers.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=33}}

The next step is to educate both the rights holders and the duty bearers by articulating the rights of citizens and duty of the [[government]]. This is an important step so both parties are knowledgeable about their individual rights, responsibilities, and roles in society. This enables effective communication necessary between rights holders and duty bearers.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=34}}

After an extensive [[situation analysis]], a project or program is developed. The program needs to address [[human rights]] deficits related to certain groups, communities, or countries facing abuses or [[discrimination]]. Baselines and benchmarks are set, which create transparency and [[accountability]] in the project. Goals are also created during this step in order to analyze the program's effectiveness in a [[human rights]] context at the end of the project. Finally, NGOs encourage control over the project by the affected peoples, utilizing the Right to Participate principle.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=36}}

To determine the effectiveness of a project, it is essential all inputs, outputs, goals, and outcomes are assessed through a [[human rights]] lens. The results should then be organized in a [[logframe]], to show the clear results of the project.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=37}}

==Criticism==
This new development theory of rights-based approach has been met with positive feedback as well as criticism. There are thoughts that incorporating the language of human rights with development is just a change of terminology and doesn’t change the programs being implemented.  The ability for a state to implement public policy has been hindered due to the need to comply with economic and social rights (ESC rights).  Development practices without combining them with [[human rights]] has been more effective in implementing and monitoring programs.  Therefore, the need to combine human rights with development is not necessary for the beneficiaries.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

While there still is more positive feedback when dealing with rights-based approach to development there are still criticisms surrounding the focus on combining human rights with development.  These criticisms stem from the idea that changing the terminology will not increase NGOs' productivity or even necessarily the NGOs' programs that are being implemented.  Just by stating that the government and corporations should now be responsible for development as an issue of human rights does not mean that any changes in procedures will occur.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

Another criticism that has been brought up is that there have been many NGOs that have combined the ideas of human rights along with development before the term "rights-based approach to development" was coined.  There has been a natural linkage between development and rights and there has frequently been pressure on states and governments to be involved with issues of human rights as well as development.  Therefore, in many cases, changing the terminology will not increase the effectiveness of the state.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

There have been other criticisms of the rights-based approach to development because the ideas and theories have not been narrowed.  Rights-based approach is a vague term that doesn't clearly represent a set of ideas.  There is a multiplicity of explanations about rights-based approach that poses problems when discussing how NGOs, donor agencies or UN programs will try to implement these ideas into their programs.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

One example of implementation is within the realm of [[Gender and Development]].  [[Women's rights]] have long been fighting for equal rights and by implementing rights-based approach to development it changes some of the ways women's equal rights were being implemented effectively into society.  There have been two main paths relating to inequalities of gender; these include human rights organizations that focus on women's equal rights and organizations focused on gender and development.  By converging these two different ideas it can create problems with the experts and the way the programs are being implemented.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

There is also disparity between NGOs in the north and NGOs in the south between their viewpoints and ideas in which to implement programs in relation to development and human rights separately.  By trying to combine these two discourses across the globe can create problems of fragmentation of ideas and programs.  If fragmentation were to occur it would be the opposite intention of the NGOs that were trying to combine human rights and development into similar programs.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

A '''ruling clique''' is a group of people who jointly rule an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[form of government]].

Ruling cliques generally differ from another type of oligarchy: a [[military junta]]. Military juntas are always ruled by military personnel (often high-ranking like [[general]]). A ruling clique can include people from various professions. The ruling [[elite]]s who comprise the leadership tend to form a council, [[political party]], or another form of an organized group. The high-ranking members share a rough balance of power although sometimes one or more members seek to increase their power at the expense of others or some of them may attempt to transform the system into an [[autocracy]] or make it more [[democracy|democratic]].

Some ruling cliques could be considered a form of [[aristocracy]] while others are based on a very small circle of rulers rather than a broader based organization such as a political party. In some cases, the entire ruling clique is composed of a council of leaders who are the only members of the clique.

[[Calliope]] at the center, and clockwise from top: [[Socrates]], [[Chilon]], [[Pittacus]], [[Periander]], [[Cleobulus]] (damaged section), [[Bias of Priene|Bias]], [[Thales]], and [[Solon]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
The '''Seven Sages''' ('''of Greece''') or '''Seven Wise Men''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|οἱ ἑπτὰ σοφοί}} ''hoi hepta sophoi'') was the title given by [[classical Greece|classical Greek]] tradition to seven [[philosopher]]s, statesmen, and law-givers of the [[6th century BC]] who were renowned for their [[Sophia (wisdom)|wisdom]].

==The Seven Sages==
The list of seven sages includes:
* [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]] ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;624 – {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;546 BC) is the first well-known philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer. His advice, "[[Know thyself]]," was engraved on the front [[facade]] of the [[Oracle of Apollo|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Delphi]].
* [[Pittacus of Mytilene]] ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;640 – 568 BC) governed [[Mytilene]] ([[Lesbos]]). He tried to reduce the power of the nobility and was able to govern with the support of the [[wikt:demos#Noun 2|demos]], whom he favoured.
* [[Bias of Priene]] (fl. 6th century BC) was a politician and legislator of the 6th century BC.
* [[Solon|Solon of Athens]] ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;638 – 558 BC) was a famous legislator and reformer from [[Athens]], framing the laws that shaped the [[Athenian democracy]].

== Sources and legends ==
[[File:Seven_Sages_of_Greece.jpg|thumb|right|Earliest passage in which the Seven Wise Men are mentioned together, from [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]].]]
The oldest&lt;ref&gt;A. Griffiths, "Seven Sages", in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' (3rd ed.). All the sources are collected in Bruno Snell, ''Leben und Meinungen der Sieben Weisen. Griechische und lateinische Quellen erläutert und übertragen.'' Munich, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; explicit mention on record of a standard list of seven sages is in [[Plato]]'s [[Protagoras (dialogue)|''Protagoras'']], where [[Socrates]] says:
{{quote|...There some, both at present and of old, who recognized that [[Sparta]]nizing is much more a love of wisdom than a love of physical exercise, knowing that the ability to utter such [brief and terse] remarks belongs to a perfectly educated man.  Among these were [[Thales of Miletus]], and [[Pittacus of Mytilene]], and [[Bias of Priene]], and our own [[Solon]], and [[Cleobulus]] of Lindus, and [[Myson of Chenae]], and the seventh of them was said to be [[Chilon of Sparta]].  They all emulated and admired and were students of Spartan education, could tell their wisdom was of this sort by the brief but memorable remarks they each uttered when they met and jointly the first fruits of their wisdom to Apollo in his shrine at [[Delphi]], writing what is on every man's lips:  ''Know thyself'', and ''Nothing too much''.  Why do I say this?  Because this was the manner of philosophy among the ancients, a kind of [[laconic]] brevity.&lt;ref&gt;''Protagoras'' 342e–343b, trans. R.E. Allen.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The section of the Protagoras in which appears this passage is "elaborately ironical", making it unclear which of its parts may be taken seriously,&lt;ref&gt;p. 156, [[James Adam (classicist)|James Adam]], ''Platonis Protagoras'', Cambridge University Press, 1893; p. 83, C.C.W. Taylor, ''Plato: Protagoras'', Oxford University Press, 2002.  The words "elaborately ironical" are Adam's.&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Diogenes Laertius]] later confirms that there were indeed seven such individuals who were held in high esteem for their wisdom well before Plato's time. According to [[Demetrius Phalereus]], it was during the [[Archon of Athens|archonship]] of Damasias (582/1 BC) that the seven first become known as "the wise men", Thales being the first so acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Kirk|Kirk]], Raven, &amp; Schofield, ''The Presocratic Philosophers'' (Cambridge, 1983, 2nd edition), p. 76, citing Diogenes Laertius, i. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nuremberg chronicles f 60v 1.png|right|thumb|The Seven Sages, depicted in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]
Diogenes points out, however, that there was among his sources great disagreement over which figures should be counted among the seven.&lt;ref name="laertius141"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, i. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the two most common substitutions were to exchange [[Periander]] or [[Anacharsis]] for Myson. On Diogenes' first list of seven, which he introduces with the words "These men are acknowledged wise," [[Periander]] appears instead of [[Myson]];&lt;ref name="laertius113"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, i. 13&lt;/ref&gt; the same substitution appears in ''The Masque of the Seven Sages'' by [[Ausonius]].&lt;ref&gt;Ausonius, [https://archive.org/stream/deciausonius01ausouoft#page/310/mode/2up ''The Masque of the Seven Sages'']&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Ephorus]]&lt;ref name="laertius141"/&gt; and [[Plutarch]] (in his ''Banquet of the Seven Sages'') substituted Anacharsis for Myson. Diogenes Laertius further states that [[Dicaearchus]] gave ten possible names,&lt;ref name="laertius141"/&gt; [[Hippobotus]] suggested twelve names,&lt;ref name="laertius142"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, i. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hermippus of Smyrna|Hermippus]] enumerated seventeen possible sages from which different people made different selections of seven.&lt;ref name="laertius142"/&gt; Leslie Kurke contends that "[[Aesop]] was a popular contender for inclusion in the group"; an epigram of the 6th century AD poet [[Agathias]] (''Palatine Anthology'' 16.332) refers to a statue of the Seven Sages, with Aesop standing before them.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Kurke, ''Aesopic Conversations: Popular Tradition, Cultural Dialogue, and the Invention of Greek Prose'', Princeton University Press, 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;131–2, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later tradition ascribed to each sage a pithy saying of his own, but ancient as well as modern scholars have doubted the legitimacy of such ascriptions.&lt;ref&gt;H. Parke and D. Wormell, ''The Delphic Oracle'', (Basil Blackwell, 1956), vol. 1, pp. 387–389.&lt;/ref&gt;  A compilation of 147 maxims, inscribed at Delphi, was preserved by the fifth century AD scholar [[Stobaeus]] as "Sayings of the Seven Sages,"&lt;ref&gt;Kurke, p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt; but "the actual authorship of the...maxims set up on the Delphian temple may be left uncertain.  Most likely they were popular proverbs, which tended later to be attributed to particular sages."&lt;ref&gt;Parke &amp; Wormell, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being credited for pithy sayings, the wise men were also apparently famed for practical inventions; in Plato's [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] (600a), it is said that it "befits a wise man" to have "many inventions and useful devices in the crafts or sciences" attributed to him, citing Thales and [[Anacharsis]] the [[Scythia]]n as examples.

According to a number of moralistic stories, there was a golden tripod (or, in some versions of the story, a bowl or cup) which was to be given to the wisest.  Allegedly, it passed in turn from one of the seven sages to another, beginning with Thales, until one of them (either Thales or Solon, depending on the story) finally dedicated it to [[Apollo]] who was held to be wisest of all.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius i. 27ff.; R. Martin, "Seven Sages", ''Encyclopedia of Classical Philosophy'' (ed. D. Zeyl, 1997), p. 487; Parke &amp; Wormell, pp. 387–388&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diogenes, [[Dicaearchus]] claimed that the seven "were neither wise men nor philosophers, but merely shrewd men, who had studied legislation."&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, i. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  And according to at least one modern scholar, the claim is correct:  "With the exception of Thales, no one whose life is contained in [Diogenes'] Book I [i.e. none of the above] has any claim to be styled a philosopher."&lt;ref&gt;p. 42 note a, R. Hicks, ''Diogenes Laertius: Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', vol. 1, Harvard University Press, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southam's Cardall Collection''' contains [[Cultural artifact|artefacts]], [[document]]s, and [[photograph]]s relating to the history of the town of [[Southam]], [[Warwickshire]], [[England]], including its people, and the surrounding villages.&lt;ref name=Friends&gt;{{cite book| author=Cardall Collection | title=A Heritage Centre for Southam | year=2010 | publisher=Friends of the Cardall Collection | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, the Collection has been managed by a team of volunteers, '''The Friends of the Cardall Collection'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Cadogan | first=Bernard | title=Community Archives | url=http://www.communityarchives.org.uk/page_id__947_path__0p2p12p35p.aspx | accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the collection is at risk because it does not have a suitable, permanent home. The Friends of the Cardall Collection's primary aim is to establish a permanent home for the collection within Southam town centre, to enable it to be used for the benefit of the wider community. Members of the Friends are interested in the history of Southam and its surrounding villages.&lt;ref name=Friends /&gt;

==Background==
The collection was started by the late Jack Cardall, and his widow, Rene, continued this work until her death in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.leamingtoncourier.co.uk/news/local/last_call_before_collection_is_sold_1_1057025 | title=Last call before collection is sold|newspaper=The Courier, [[Leamington Spa]] | date=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains in excess of 4,500 items. In addition, there is a photographic [[archive]], largely donated by a local historian, that contains over 1,500 negatives and slides, and 450 unique glass negatives taken by an amateur photographer in the early days of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Friends /&gt;

Southam is a historic market town in Warwickshire, England, and has many unique and ancient buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Megalithic Portal | url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18421|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on major north/south and east/west routes, it was for many years a bustling transport and trading hub, particularly in the era before railways.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Funding and support==
The Friends of Southam's Cardall Collection receives support from the Warwickshire Community Museum’s Officer, including advice, training and information about funding opportunities.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The work of the Friends is funded by donations, membership subscriptions, sales of small items, and small grants from awarding bodies. The Group has had some success with applications for small grants for specific projects. Computer equipment, scanners, lighting equipment, projectors, etc. have been acquired to support community work and to carry out the conservation work that underpins the group's activities. However, to pay for running costs (rent, rates, electricity, water,) volunteers also have to concentrate on revenue earning projects.&lt;ref name=Friends /&gt;

'''''The Yankles''''' is a 2009 film directed by David R. Brooks, about a fictitious college-level baseball team made up of students from an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Yeshiva]].

Filmed in Utah with a "predominantly [[Mormon]] cast," the film was shown at a number of film festivals, winning a number of festival awards, although it was never theatrically released.&lt;ref name="numbers"&gt;[http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=7328 www.the-numbers.com, retrieved August 14, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2012 it was picked up by [[Magnolia Pictures|Magnolia Home Entertainment]] for DVD release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.hbindependent.com/2012-06-06/entertainment/tn-hbi-0607-yankles-20120606_1_baseball-team-independent-film-anaheim-international-film-festival/2 Stockdale, Jenny, Huntington Beach Independent, June 6, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot and title==
The [[Rosh yeshiva]] ([[rabbi]]nical dean) of an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] [[yeshiva]] (theological school) decides that the school should have a baseball team to compete in the college league. Elliot (Michael Buster), one of the students with a background in minor league baseball, is able to convince Charlie Jones (Brian Wimmer), a former major league player who had been imprisoned as a result of DUI convictions—and now has to perform almost 200 hours of community service—to coach the team. As he coaches the team, he gives the players "a new measure of skill and confidence," as they help him regain his self-respect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_yankles_2011/ Rottentomatoes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The title is the name of the ball team, based on Yankle as the [[Yiddish language]] nickname for Jacob, used as a play-on-words with the famous ball team, the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]].&lt;ref name="heartland"&gt;[http://emol.org/film/archives/heartlandfilmfestival/2010/yankles.html Ritrosky, Madelyn, Film Entertainment Magazine, retrieved August 14, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional pun is reflected in the words painted on the school bus the yeshiva ball team uses: "In the Big Inning."&lt;ref name="heartland"/&gt;

==Themes==
According to publicity releases, the film is "not just a funny film about baseball; it's about second chances, reconciliation and forgiveness....about making mistakes and moving on, about living by principles and not passions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.hbindependent.com/2012-01-04/entertainment/tn-hbi-0105-yankles-20120104_1_independent-film-newport-beach-film-festival-screening Vittachi, Imran, "Film with local ties to screen at Bella Terra," Huntington Beach Independent, January 4, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Co-writers (and brothers) David and Zev Brooks have stated that the idea for the movie came to them when they were discussing movie concepts at their dinner table and the film ''[[The Chosen (1981 film)|The Chosen]]'' brought to mind a movie scene with Orthodox and non-Orthodox students playing baseball.&lt;ref name="triad"&gt;[http://gotriad.news-record.com/content/2011/02/23/article/the_yankles Milan, Alexa, "The Yankles," Feb. 24, 2011, gotriad.com]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; They agreed the image was "visually entertaining" and built the film around that image.&lt;ref name="triad"/&gt;

Once the script was completed, the brothers established "DZB productions" and began seeking out investors to fund the film. When it became clear that shooting a low-budget independent film in Los Angeles would be too expensive for them, they made the decision to film the movie in Utah, using many local men and women for cast and crew.&lt;ref name="triad"/&gt;  According to the film's creators, the decision to film in Utah was made based on a combination of economic factors, the cooperation they would receive from the Utah Film Commission, and the large number of actors and film crew members who lived in that State.&lt;ref name="deseret"&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705376594/The-Yankles-featured-at-LDS-Jewish-film-festivals.html?pg=all Hardy, Rodger L., "'The Yankles' featured at LDS, Jewish Film Festivals," Deseret News, January 26, 2010, retrieved August 14, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently because of the large number of Mormon actors and crew members involved in the production, the film (featured in many Jewish film festivals) was included in the "LDS Film Festival" as well.&lt;ref name="deseret"/&gt;

While the brothers co-wrote the film, David directed it and Zev produced it.&lt;ref name="numbers"/&gt; The movie was filmed on a tight schedule, and because the actors were not trained baseball players—and there was no time on the schedule to hold a training camp to improve their skills—the number of actual scenes of ball games were limited.&lt;ref name="numbers"/&gt;

The script was completed by the two brothers in 1996, and most of the film was completed by 2007, but a post-production lack of funding postponed the film's completion until 2009.&lt;ref name="heartland"/&gt;

===DVD extras===
The DVD includes an 11-minute behind-the-scenes film, 11 minutes of extended musical numbers, and 16 minutes of deleted scenes.&lt;ref name ="numbers"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18733">'''Theological aesthetics''' is the interdisciplinary study of [[theology]] and [[aesthetics]], and has been defined as being "concerned with questions about [[God]] and issues in theology in the light of and perceived through sense knowledge ([[wikt:sensation|sensation]], [[feeling]], [[imagination]]), through [[beauty]], and [[the arts]]".&lt;ref name="Thiessen"&gt;{{cite_book | author=Gesa Elsbeth Thiessen | title=Theological Aesthetics: A Reader | publisher=Eerdmans | year=2004 | isbn=0-8028-2888-4 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of study is broad and includes not only a theology of beauty, but also the dialogue between '''theology and the arts''', such as [[dance]], [[drama]], [[film]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[poetry]], and the [[visual arts]].

Notable theologians and philosophers that have dealt with this subject include [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Barth]], and [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], among others.

Theological aesthetics has recently seen rapid growth as a subject for discussions, publications, and advanced academic studies.

==Aesthetics in Christian theology==

===The early church===
Theological writings during the period of the early Christian church which deal with aesthetics span from circa 160 to c. 650 and include writings by [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Origen]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], and [[Maximus the Confessor]], among others. Prevalent themes during this period included "the [[Divinization (Christian)|vision of God]] or of God's glory, the image of God in Christ and in us, and the concern with idol worship".&lt;ref name="Thiessen9"&gt;Thiessen, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The medieval church===
During the [[Middle Ages]], Western theologians such as [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[John Scotus Eriugena]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Nicholas of Cusa]], and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] touched upon themes such as "the idea of beauty, the vision of God, the image of Christ, the [[iconodule]]-[[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] conflict, and the strong presence of personally grounded and poetic [[doxology|doxologies]]".&lt;ref name="Thiessen59"&gt;Thiessen, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Reformation===
Concerning aesthetics, the theologians of the 16th century [[Protestant Reformation]] ([[Martin Luther]], [[Jean Calvin]], and [[Huldrych Zwingli]]) dealt primarily with "the theology of the image, in particular, [[idolatry]] and [[iconoclasm]]".&lt;ref name="Thiessen125"&gt;Thiessen, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 17th - 19th centuries===
Theological aesthetics increased in diversity during this period, with activity such as "the composition of [[hymns]] in [[Protestant]] circles, [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Edwards]]' writing on beauty, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] artists and intellectuals with their [[panentheism|panentheist]] sensibilities, [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]]'s idea of religion as feeling and intuition, the decline of religious art, and the ground-breaking philosophical contributions of thinkers such as [[Edmund Burke|Burke]], [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]]."&lt;ref name="Thiessen159"&gt;Thiessen, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 20th century===
Some major themes which emerged and developed in the 20th century included the question of "how art can function as a source of and in theology"&lt;ref name="Thiessen204"&gt;Thiessen, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Tillich]], [[Rahner]], [[John Dillenberger|Dillenberger]]), the question of "the art work as a shaper of meaning in today's culture"&lt;ref name="Thiessen205"&gt;Thiessen, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Frank Burch Brown|Burch Brown]], [[Harvey Cox|Cox]], [[Hans Küng|Küng]]), "the essential role of imagination in theology"&lt;ref name="Thiessen206"&gt;Thiessen, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[William Lynch (theologian)|Lynch]], [[John McIntyre (theologian)|McIntyre]], [[Garrett Green|Green]]), and the beauty of God ([[Gerardus van der Leeuw|van der Leeuw]], [[Karl Barth|Barth]], [[von Balthasar]]). [[Hans Rookmaaker|Rookmaaker]] helpfully sought to provide a reformed Christian critique of art and aesthetics in the cultural and political upheavals of the 1960s in his book 'Modern Art and the Death of a Culture'.

'''Tikal Temple I''' is the designation given to one of the major structures at [[Tikal]], one of the largest cities and [[List of Maya sites|archaeological site]]s of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] in [[Mesoamerica]]. It is located in the [[Petén Basin]] region of northern [[Guatemala]]. It also is known as the '''Temple of the Great Jaguar''' because of a [[lintel]] that represents a king sitting upon a jaguar throne.&lt;ref name="Muñoz Cosme 1996, p.302"&gt;Muñoz Cosme &amp; Quintana Samayoa 1996, p.302.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative name is the '''Temple of Ah Cacao''', after the ruler buried in the temple.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;''Ah Cacao'' being an earlier nickname for the Tikal ruler Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, whose tomb the temple contains.&lt;/ref&gt; Temple I is a typically Petén-styled [[limestone]] [[Mesoamerican pyramids|stepped pyramid structure]] that is dated to approximately 732 AD.

Situated at the heart of a [[World Heritage Site]], the temple is surmounted by a characteristic [[roof comb]], a distinctive [[Maya architecture|Maya architectural]] feature. Building Temple I on the eastern side of the Great Plaza was a significant deviation from the established tradition of building funerary temples just north of the plaza in Tikal's [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]].&lt;ref name=st400&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.400.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mg47&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The structure is a funerary temple associated with [[Jasaw Chan K'awiil I]], a [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] ruler of the [[polity]] based at Tikal, who ruled from AD 682–734.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.313, 397.&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb of this ruler has been located by archaeologists deep within the structure,&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, pp.45–47.&lt;/ref&gt; the tomb having been built first with the temple being raised over it. Construction of both were overseen by Jasaw Chan K'awiil's son and heir [[Yik'in Chan K'awiil]].&lt;ref name=st397&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.397–400.&lt;/ref&gt; Jasaw Chan K'awiil probably planned the building of the temple long before his death.&lt;ref name=st400/&gt; The temple rises in nine stepped levels, which may be symbolic of the nine levels of the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2001, pp.132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple has grooved moldings and inset corners. A steep staircase climbs the temple to the summit shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Fuente et al 1999, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pyramid, Tikal, Guatemala.jpg|thumb|left|Temple I, seen from the northwest]]

The temple rises {{convert|47|m|ft|sp=us}} over the Great Plaza.&lt;ref name=mg47/&gt; The pyramid is topped by a funerary shrine, containing finely carved wooden lintels, the execution of which probably was overseen by Jasaw Chan K'awiil as part of his plans for his funerary monument.&lt;ref name=st400/&gt; The lintels were carved from [[sapodilla]] wood and one of them, Lintel 3, once was painted red.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1962, p.494.

Two of these planks were removed in the nineteenth century and their location now is unknown.&lt;ref name="Coe 1967, 1988, p.29"/&gt; The other two were removed by [[Alfred Maudslay]] and shipped to the [[British Museum]], where they now are warehoused.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=41468&amp;peoA=41468-3-9 British Museum Collection (1)].

[http://www.tikalpark.com/generalinfo.htm Website of Tikal National Park]&lt;/ref&gt; The scene carved onto one lintel shows a seated figure with an enormous serpent rising above him.&lt;ref name="Coe 1967, 1988, p.29"/&gt;

The shrine bears a high roof comb decorated with a sculpture of the seated king, Jasaw Chan K'awiil, although it now is difficult to discern.&lt;ref name=mg47/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2001, p.134.&lt;/ref&gt; The roof comb consists of two parallel structures with an enclosed, vaulted hollow between them, which reduces the weight of the construction,.&lt;ref name="Coe 1967, 1988, p.28"&gt;Coe 1967, 1988, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of this heavy superstructure is borne through the spine of the temple.&lt;ref name=mg47/&gt; The front of the roof comb was finished with stone blocks carved to represent the enormous figure of the king, flanked by scrolls and serpents.&lt;ref name="Coe 1967, 1988, p.28"/&gt; It originally supported molded plaster decoration as well.&lt;ref&gt;Fuente et al 1999, pp.145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; The shrine contains three narrow, dark chambers that were accessible only through a single doorway.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2001, p.134. Coe 1967, 1988, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; The three rooms were arranged one behind the other, and had high [[Corbel arch|corbel-vaulted]] ceilings, braced by wooden beams. The beams were fashioned from sapodilla, the wood that was used in the lintels.&lt;ref name="Coe 1967, 1988, p.29"/&gt;

Temple I was reused in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic Period]]. The Late Classic burial shaft was reopened apparently, and a new burial made inside. The offerings accompanying the new burial included [[censer]]s of a type found in [[Mayapán]] and two [[pottery|ceramic]] types that were widespread in Petén during the Postclassic. The type of censer associated with the new burial was not used after the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1962, pp.482–483.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal tomb==
The tomb of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I was discovered by archaeologists in 1962. It was entered through the roof of the tomb after exploratory tunneling from the bottom of the temple stairway.&lt;ref name=mg47/&gt;&lt;ref name=st397/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p.277.&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb has been labeled as Burial 116 by archaeologists. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid, below the level of the Great Plaza. Over half of the chamber is occupied by the masonry bench supporting the king's body and his jewelry. The king's remains had been laid on a woven mat and the tomb contained rich offerings of jaguar skins, [[jadeite]] objects, painted ceramics, rare [[spondylus]] shells, [[pearl]]s, mirrors, and other works of art.&lt;ref name=mg47/&gt;&lt;ref name=st397/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, pp.277–278.&lt;/ref&gt; The body of the king was covered with large quantities of [[jade]] ornaments including an enormous necklace with 114 especially large beads, as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king, and weighing {{convert|3.9|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name=mg47/&gt;&lt;ref name=st397/&gt;

One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate jade [[mosaic]] vessel with the lid bearing a sculpted portrait of the king. Also accompanying the burial was a series of 37 finely carved human bones bearing inscribed [[Maya script|hieroglyphic]] texts, arranged in a pile by the king's right foot.&lt;ref name=mg47/&gt;&lt;ref name=st397/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p.278.&lt;/ref&gt; One refers to Tikal's allies, including [[Copán]] and [[Palenque]]; others include the king's name and parentage. One contains a carved portrait of a captive, Ox Ha Te Ixil, who was a vassal of Tikal's great enemy [[Calakmul]]. There also are scenes that show the [[Maya maize god|maize deity]] being carried to the underworld in a canoe. One of the bones contains a lengthy list of the death dates of foreign nobles.&lt;ref name=st397/&gt;

==Modern history==
Tikal was discovered in 1848. In 1877 various pieces were looted from the major temples at Tikal, including pieces of Temple I.&lt;ref name="Muñoz Cosme 1996, p.302"/&gt; [[Alfred P. Maudslay]] first mapped the centre of Tikal in 1881–1882, marking the five major temples on his sketch, including Temple I, although he named the major temples alphabetically, ranging from A through to E. [[Teoberto Maler]] carried out the first [[topography|topographical]] survey of the site in 1895, naming Temple I as the "First Great Temple". [[Alfred Tozzer]] carried out another survey in 1911 and generally followed Maler's naming conventions; it was he who abbreviated the name to Temple I.&lt;ref name="Muñoz Cosme 1996, p.302"/&gt;

In 1955, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] began its Tikal Project, carrying out archaeological investigations of the ruins and preparing them to be opened for tourism, which included work on Temple I and Temple II. The project was overseen by Aubrey Trik and George Guillemin.&lt;ref name="Muñoz Cosme 1996, pp.302-3"&gt;Muñoz Cosme &amp; Quintana Samayoa 1996, pp.302–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb under the temple was not discovered until 1962, by Aubrey Trik of the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p.124.&lt;/ref&gt; The work on Temple I lasted until 1964.&lt;ref name="Muñoz Cosme 1996, pp.302-3"/&gt;

In 1986 the Proyecto Nacional Tikal (PRONAT) carried out repairs to cracks in the roof of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz Cosme &amp; Quintana Samayoa 1996, p.303.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[2012 phenomenon]], modern Maya held a fire ceremony on 21 December 2012 at dawn in the main plaza in front of the temple. Guatemalan and foreign priests led the ceremony, asking for unity, peace and the end of discrimination and racism, with the hope that the new cycle that begins will be a "new dawn" for them. About 3,000 people participated in the event.&lt;ref&gt;Grupo Nación 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6504">[[File:Tikal2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.7|The roof comb of Temple III standing above the forest canopy]]
'''Tikal Temple III''', also known as the '''Temple of the Jaguar Priest''',&lt;ref name="Coe67p76"&gt;Coe 1967, 1988, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the principal temple [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] at the ancient [[Maya city]] of [[Tikal]], in the [[Petén Department]] of modern [[Guatemala]]. The temple stands approximately {{convert|55|m|ft}} tall.&lt;ref name="Coe67p76"/&gt; The summit shrine of Temple III differs from those of the other major temples at Tikal in that it only possesses two rooms instead of the usual three.&lt;ref name="Coe67p76"/&gt; The pyramid was built in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic Period]], and has been dated to 810 AD using the [[Maya script|hieroglyphic text]] on Stela 24, which was raised at the base of its access stairway.&lt;ref name="Coe67p76"/&gt; Stela 24 is paired with the damaged Altar 6, in a typical [[Maya stelae|stela-altar pair]].&lt;ref name="Coe67p76"/&gt;

Temple III is associated with the little-known king [[Dark Sun (Maya ruler)|Dark Sun]],&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.305.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is likely that Temple III is Dark Sun's funerary temple.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of Temple III indicated that Tikal was still politically stable at the beginning of the 9th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Valdés and Fahsen 2005, p.150.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was the last temple pyramid raised at Tikal and by the end of the 9th century the city had fallen into ruin.&lt;ref name="Phillips0607p417"&gt;Phillips 2006, 2007, p.417.&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple III is only partially restored and is closed to the public; it has not been the subject of archaeological investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Gómez 2006, p.768.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The structure==
{{Maya civilization}}
Temple III is immediately south of the Tozzer [[sacbe|Causeway]] and faces eastwards towards the Great Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 2006, 2007, p.417. Coe 1967, 1988, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; The inner doorway separating the two chambers of the summit shrine supports a finely sculpted lintel representing an obese figure wrapped in a [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican culture|jaguar]] skin.&lt;ref name="Coe67p77"&gt;Coe 1967, 1988, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of only two sculpted lintels at Tikal that are still in their original setting.&lt;ref name="Coe67p77"&gt;Coe 1967, 1988, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple structure was restored in 1967 and 1969 by the Tikal Project of the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|University Museum]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], concentrating upon the summit shrine and the [[roof comb]]. The pyramid body itself was not restored but is known to have nine stepped levels and an east-facing access stairway.&lt;ref name="Schieber97p292"&gt;Schieber de Lavarreda 1997, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

The roof comb and the outer chamber of the summit shrine have suffered lightning damage, causing a {{convert|10|cm|in|adj=on}} wide crack in the eastern wall of the [[Corbel arch|corbel vaulting]].&lt;ref name="Schieber97p292"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2829">'''United States of China''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 中華合衆國; [[Simplified Chinese]]: 中华合众国; [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: Zhonghua Hezhongguo) is a political concept first devised in the early 1920s by [[Chen Jiongming]] of a  [[federalism|federalized]] [[China]] modeled closely after the [[United States of America]].  Given the political, social and linguistic realities of China in the [[warlord]] period, Chen Jiongming believed that a federalist approach was the only feasible way to eventually establish a united, [[democratic republic]].  Beginning with [[Guangdong]] as a model state, he wanted to organize a "United States of China in the manner of the American experience" through negotiation with federalists from all parts of the country (New York Times June 27, 1922).

The introduction of [[Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China|Special Economic Zones]] since the 1980s have led to the development of several distinct regional economies within the [[People's Republic of China]], such as the [[Pearl River Delta]], [[Yangtze River Delta]], and the  [[Bohai Circle]].  Several of these regions have economies the size of small developed nations. Some scholars who use the term United States of China argue that during the process of [[Chinese economic reform]] the People's Republic has evolved into a de facto federal state in which these economic regions have wide discretion to implement policy goals which are set by the PRC central government and in which provinces and localities actively compete with each other in order to advance economically.

The '''Institute for [[social research|Social Research]]''' ({{lang-de|Institut für Sozialforschung}}, '''IfS''') is a research organization for [[sociology]] and [[continental philosophy]], best known as the institutional home of the [[Frankfurt School]] and [[critical theory]].

==History==
[[Image:InstitutfuerSozialforschung3.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The current building of the Institute for Social Research, at Senckenberganlage 26 in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] {{coord|50.118414|8.65385|type:landmark_region:DE_source:enwiki| display=inline}}]]
The Institute was founded in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1923, where it was (and {{As of|2005|lc=on}} once again is) affiliated with the [[University of Frankfurt am Main]]. It was founded by [[Felix Weil]], a student of the [[Marxist philosopher]] [[Karl Korsch]], with an endowment provided by Weil's wealthy father [[Hermann Weil]]. Its first director, [[Kurt Albert Gerlach]], died before making his mark, and was swiftly followed by [[Carl Grünberg]], a Marxist historian who gathered together fellow "orthodox" [[Marxist]]s at the Institute, including his former pupil [[Henryk Grossman]].   Grünberg was followed by co-founder [[Friedrich Pollock]].

Following a non-fatal heart attack, Grünberg was succeeded in 1930 by [[Max Horkheimer]].  Horkheimer rapidly became the guiding spirit of the Frankfurt School, a group of thinkers that was born under his directorship at the Institute. Horkheimer edited the group's journal ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' (Journal for Social Research) and wrote essays defining a [[critical theory of society]].

The growing influence of the Nazis led the founders to decide in September 1930 to prepare to move the Institute out of Germany, by establishing a branch in Geneva and moving the funds to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins of Critical Theory: An interview with Leo Lowenthal" by {{Interlanguage link multi|Helmut Dubiel|de}} in ''Telos'' 49&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, after the rise of [[Hitler]], the Institute left [[Germany]] for [[Geneva]] and then in 1934 moved to [[New York City]].  In New York it became affiliated with [[Columbia University]], and its journal ''[[Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung]]'' was renamed ''[[Studies in Philosophy and Social Science]]''.  It was there that much of the important work of the Frankfurt School thinkers began to emerge, and the Institute's residence in New York was likely partly accountable for its work's favorable reception in American and English [[academia]].

The Institute re-opened in Frankfurt in 1951 under the direction of Pollock.

The Institute has been both a research enterprise and, during its Frankfurt periods, a provider of instruction in sociology at the university there. The current director is [[Axel Honneth]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11583">{{Refimprove|date=February 2017}}'''Urban morphology''' is the study of the form of [[human settlement]]s and the process of their formation and transformation. The study seeks to understand the spatial structure and character of a [[metropolitan area]], [[city]], [[town]] or [[village]] by examining the patterns of its component parts and the ownership or control and occupation. Typically, analysis of physical form focuses on [[street]] pattern, [[Land lot|lot]] (or, in the UK, plot) pattern and [[building]] pattern, sometimes referred to collectively as urban grain.  Analysis of specific settlements is usually undertaken using cartographic sources and the process of development is deduced from comparison of historic maps.

Special attention is given to how the physical form of a city changes over time and to how different cities compare to each other. Another significant part of this subfield deals with the study of the social forms which are expressed in the physical layout of a city, and, conversely, how physical form produces or reproduces various social forms.

The essence of the idea of morphology was initially expressed in the writings of the great poet and philosopher [[Goethe]] (1790). However, the term as such was first used in bioscience. Recently it is being increasingly used in [[geography]], [[geology]], [[philology]] and other subject areas. In geography, urban morphology as a particular field of study owes its origins to [[Lewis Mumford]], James Vance and Sam Bass Warner. Peter Hall and Michael Batty of the UK and Serge Salat, France, are also central figures.

Urban morphology is considered as the study of urban tissue, or fabric, as a means of discerning the environmental level normally associated with urban design.Tissue comprises coherent neighborhood morphology (open spaces, building) and functions (human activity). Neighborhood exhibit recognizable patterns in the ordering of buildings, spaces and functions (themes), within which variation reinforced an organizing set of principles.  This approach challenges the common perception of unplanned environments as chaotic or vaguely organic through understanding the structures and processes embedded in [[urbanisation]]. Complexity science has provided further explanations showing how urban structures emerge from the uncoordinated action of multiple individuals in highly regular ways.&lt;ref&gt;Batty, M. (2009). Cities as Complex Systems: Scaling, Interaction,Networks, Dynamics and Urban Morphologies. In Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst other things this is associated with permanent energy and material flows to maintain these structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2011.11.2130 |title=Power Laws for Energy Efficient and Resilient Cities |journal=Procedia Engineering |volume=21 |pages=1193–8 |year=2011 |last1=Salat |first1=Serge |last2=Bourdic |first2=Loeiz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some locked concepts==
Urban morphology approaches human settlements as generally unconscious products that emerge over long periods, through the accrual of successive generations of building activity.  This leaves traces that serve to structure subsequent building activity and provide opportunities and constraints for city-building processes, such as land subdivision, [[infrastructure]] development, or building construction.  Articulating and analysing the logic of these traces is the central question of urban morphology.

Urban morphology is not generally object-centred, in that it emphasises the relationships between components of the city.  To make a parallel with [[linguistics]], the focus is placed on an active [[vocabulary]] and its [[space syntax|syntax]].  There is thus a tendency to use morphological techniques to examine the ordinary, non-monumental areas of the city and to stress the process and its [[structures]] over any given state or object, therefore going beyond architecture and looking at the entire built landscape and its internal logic.

Roger Trancik discusses three  major theories of urban spatial design and urban mythology which can guide analysis:

#Figure and Ground theory
#Linkage theory
#Place Theory

[[figure-ground theory|Figure and Ground theory]] is founded on the study of the relationship of land coverage of buildings as solid mass (figure) to open voids (ground) Each urban environment has an existing pattern of solid and voids, and figure and ground approach to spatial design is an attempt to manipulate these relationships by adding to, subtracting from, or changing the physical geometry of the pattern. The objective of these manipulations is to clarify the structure of urban space in a city or district by establishing a hierarchy of spaces of different sizes that are individually enclosed but ordered directionally in relation to each other.
Linkage theory focuses on lines formed by streets, pedestrian ways, linear open spaces or other linking elements that physically connect the parts of the city. Place theory operates upon structured systems of human needs and usage.{{sfn|Trancik|1986|pp=97}}

==City-Block Two-Level Urban Morphologies==
Urban forms can be investigated based on two spatial units: city and block. The boundaries of natural cities in terms of the density of human settlements and activities are delineated with the concept of ‘redefined city’ using points of interests (POIs), and blocks are determined by road networks. Urban forms are characterised by city-block two-level spatial morphologies. The redefined cities reveal the effects of different city development stages on urban forms &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13658816.2018.1511793 |title=Are all cities with similar urban form or not? Redefining cities with ubiquitous points of interest and evaluating them with indicators at city and block levels in China|journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science  |year=2018 |last1=Song |first1=Yongze |last2=Long |first2=Ying |last3=Wu |first3=Peng |last4=Wang |first4=Xiangyu}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Schools of thought==
In a broad sense there are three schools of urban morphology: Italian, British, and French.
The Italian school centres around the work of [[Saverio Muratori]] and dates from the 1940s.  Muratori attempted to develop an 'operational history' for the cities he studied (in particular Venice and Rome), which then provided the basis for the integration of new architectural works in the syntax of the urban tissue.  Stemming from this view are contributions such as Gianfranco Caniggia's, which conceptualise the city as an organic result of a dynamic procedural [[typology (urban planning and architecture)|typology]], which see [[Political economics|political-economic]] forces as shaping a built landscape already conditioned by a particular logic, set of elements, and characteristic processes.

The British school centres around the work of [[M.R.G. Conzen]], who developed a technique called 'town-plan analysis.'  The key aspects for analysis according to Conzen are:
#The town plan
#Pattern of building forms
#Pattern of land use

The town plan in turn contains three complexes of plan element:
#''Streets'' and their arrangement into a ''street-system''
#''Plots'' (or lots) and their aggregation into ''street-blocks''
#Buildings, in the form of the ''block-plans''.

For Conzen, understanding the layering of these aspects and elements through history is the key to comprehending urban form.  Followers of Conzen such as [http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/whitehand-jeremy.aspx J.W.R. Whitehand] have examined the ways in which such knowledge can be put to use in the management of historic and contemporary townscapes.

The French school, based principally at the Versailles School of Architecture, has generated extensive methodological knowledge for the analysis of urbanisation processes and related architectural models.  Much emphasis is placed upon the importance of built space for sustaining social practices; the relationship between the built landscape and the social world is [[dialectical]], with both shaping the other.

===Chicago School===

As an urban-industrial city, Chicago's socio-economic problems were obvious and crying out to be studied in depth. Therefore, several urban sociologists and geographers, such as [[WI Thomas]] (concerned with migration), [[Robert E Park]] and [[Ernest Burgess]], attempted to analyse the morphology of Chicago in order to solve these problems.

Burgess employed an ecological approach in placing emphasis on the relationship between organisms and their environment. He used similar biological factors used in explaining plant distribution and established a concentric-zonal theory which included a [[Central Business District]] (CBD), an area of transition (invaded by business and migrants), and area of upper class apartments and several commuter zones and suburbs on the edge of the city.

===Morphogenetic School===

The scientist [[Maitri Singhai]] and the mathematician [[Nikos Salingaros]] have created a new school of urban morphology based on [[morphogenesis]] and [[emergence]]. In [[The Nature of Order]] Alexander proposes that urban development is a computational process similar to that of cell growth in an organism, and that the unfolding of these processes produces the urban landscape and its typologies. Some urbanists have sought to transform this theory into a practical [http://emergenturbanism.com/beginning-emergent-urbanism/ emergent urbanism].

'''Wreath of wheat ears''' ({{lang-de|'''Ährenkranz'''}}) is a [[political symbol]], visually a [[wreath]] made of [[Ear (botany)|ears of wheat]]. It usually represents the class of [[farmers]] in the society.

The wreath of wheat ears appeared in emblems and logos of many socialist and [[communist countries]], especially the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet states]], for its symbolic meaning of peasantry.
