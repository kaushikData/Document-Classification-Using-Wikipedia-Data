The '''AMC-5''', originally called '''GE-5''', was a [[geosynchronous]] [[direct-broadcast satellite]] located at 79 degrees west longitude, operated by [[SES Americom]] in the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]].  It was used by a variety of television customers, including being home to the [[CBS Newspath]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMC-5|publisher=CBS Newspath|format=PDF|url=http://www.cbsnewspath.com/satellite/AMC5Newspath.pdf|access-date=2009-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708124832/http://www.cbsnewspath.com/satellite/AMC5Newspath.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite was retired and moved to a [[graveyard orbit]] on 17 May 2014 after 15 years of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/download.do?attachment_key=1048011 |title=Retirement of AMC-5 (Call Sign S2156), File No. SAT-MOD-20130325-00054 |author=SatCom Law LLC |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |format=PDF |date=2014-05-23 |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Angas people,''' also known as the '''Ngas''' and the '''Kerang,''' are an ethnic group in [[Nigeria]]. Recent studies have indicated there are roughly 200,000 Anga people.

==History==
According to local folklore, the Angas migrated from Bornu passing through villages before settling on the highlands of [[Plateau State]]. In the course of migration, the groups splintered into sub-groups settling in Ampang, Amper and Kabwir districts.{{sfn|LaPin|1984|p=8}} The settlers at Kabwir were led by a chief called Gwallam and the chief of the Ampers was Kendim. Later settlements populated the highlands of the [[Jos Plateau]].

===Festival===
The Angas celebrate a major festival called the Tsafi Tar or Mos Tar, during the celebration, a brief event called Shooting the Moon takes places to mark the end season and the beginning of a new season. The festival is usually celebrated during the time of harvest.{{sfn|LaPin|1984|p=7}}

===Settlement===
The Angas who predominantly live on the lowlands and the Southeastern edge of the Jos Plateau are the largest group in the Jos highlands.{{sfn|LaPin|1984|p=8}} The major city is [[Pankshin]]. The Gyangyan or Ampang district is dominated by hills and ridges, to the  west of the ridges form the plains that constitute the lands of the Amper district. The soil of the plains of Amper are littered with granite and farmers in the district grow crops on [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] fields to plant cereal crops such as millet, guinea corn and maize. The people used the granite boulders as foundations and walls for their houses.

The '''Automobile Club de Monaco''' is a [[motoring club]] based in [[Monaco]]. The club serves as the [[Sports governing body|governing body]] for motorsport within Monaco, and organises the prestigious [[Monaco Grand Prix]] and [[Monte Carlo Rally]]. It is a member of the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]], representing Monaco as a mobility and sporting club.

Founded in 1890 as an association of cyclists, the ''Sport Vélocipédique Monégasque'', the club began to incorporate motorists in 1907 and was renamed the ''Sport Vélocipédique et Automobile Monégasque''. Alexandre Noghès, the SVAM's president, started planning the principality's first international motorsport event, the [[Monte Carlo Rally]], at the behest of [[Albert I, Prince of Monaco]]. The rally would start at points across Europe, and converge on Monaco to finish.&lt;ref name=GP&gt;{{cite web|title=Monaco profile|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cir-047.html|website=GrandPrix.com|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club ceased to organise cycling events following the First World War and was renamed the ''Automobile Club de Monaco'' in 1925.&lt;ref name=GP /&gt;

The ACM applied to the AIACR (the forerunner to the FIA) to be upgraded from a regional French club to a full national member, but had their application refused because no motorsport event was held entirely within Monaco's borders.&lt;ref name="motorsport07"&gt;Hughes, M. 2007. ''Street theatre 1929''. '''Motor Sport''', LXXXIII/3, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antony Noghès]], the son of the club's President, organised the inaugural Monaco Grand Prix in [[1929 Monaco Grand Prix|1929]] on a circuit [[Circuit de Monaco|around the streets of Monaco]], and the ACM was promptly admitted to the AIACR.&lt;ref name=GP /&gt; The Monaco Grand Prix was part of the [[European Championship (auto racing)|European Championship]] in the 1930s, and was included in the inaugural [[Formula One World Championship]] in 1950. The Grand Prix has been held continuously since 1955, and despite minor modifications over the years, it is still largely run over the same circuit as the inaugural race in 1929.

The ACM also organises the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco]], a series of races for [[Historic motorsport|historic]] Grand Prix cars held over the Circuit de Monaco, and the Rallye Monte-Carlo Historique [[classic rally]]. Other motorsport events held by the club include the [[Monaco ePrix]] and the [[Junior Monaco Kart Cup]].

The '''Balkan Federation''' project was a [[left-wing]] political movement to create a "Balkan federation".&lt;ref&gt;''Balkan federation: a history of the movement toward Balkan unity in modern times'', Smith College studies in history, Leften Stavros Stavrianos, Archon Books, 1964, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a Balkan federation emerged in the late 19th century from among left political forces in the region. The central aim was to establish a new political unity: a common federal republic unifying the [[Balkan Peninsula]] on the basis of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], [[socialism]], [[social solidarity]], and [[economic equality]]. The underlying vision was that despite differences among the Balkan peoples the historical need for emancipation was a common basis for unification.

This political concept went through three phases in its development. In the first phase the idea was articulated as a response to the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] at the beginning of the 20th century. In the second phase, mostly through the interwar period (1919–36), the idea of the Balkan federation was taken up by the Balkan Communist parties. The third phase is characterized by the clash between the Balkan Communist leaders and [[Joseph Stalin]], who opposed the idea during the post-[[World War II]] period.

== Background ==
[[File:Flag of Rigas Feraios.svg|thumb|left|[[Rigas Feraios]]'s envisioned pan-Balkan federation flag.]]
At first, in Belgrade in 1865 a number of radical Balkan intellectuals founded the Democratic Oriental Federation, proposing a federation from the [[Alps]] to [[Cyprus]] based on political freedom and social equality. They confirmed their adherence to the ideals of French Revolution in the line of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]'s federalism and in relation to the socialist ideas of [[Karl Marx]] or [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. Later, in France, a League for the Balkan Confederation, was constituted in 1894, in which Greek, Bulgarian, Serbian, and Romanian socialists participated, supporting Macedonian autonomy inside the general federation of Southeast Europe, as an attempt to deal with the complexity of the [[Macedonian Question]]. The next attempt came immediately after the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908. The following year, in Salonika, the Socialist Workers Association merged with two Bulgarian socialist groups, and the [[Socialist Workers' Federation|Socialist Worker's Federation of Ottoman Workers]] was founded. This group underestimated, till 1913, the political significance of [[nationalism]], as this significance manifested itself in the right of national self-determination. Its leadership kept a moderate position in regard with the nationalistic tendencies in Balkan [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties.

=== Balkan Socialist Federation ===

The movement for Balkan Socialist Federation arose after the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908. The First Balkan Socialist Conference was held on January 7-9, 1910 in [[Belgrade]]. The main platforms at this conference were Balkan unity and action against the impending wars. Another important aspect was the call for a solution to the Macedonian Question. In 1915, after a conference in [[Bucharest]], it was decided to create a Revolutionary Balkan Social Democratic Labour Federation, comprising groups which adhered to the [[Zimmerwald Conference]] and opposed participation in [[World War I]]. Initially headed by [[Christian Rakovsky]], it had [[Vasil Kolarov]] and [[Georgi Dimitrov]] among its prominent activists. In 1915, Dimitrov wrote that [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], "... which was split into three parts ...", would be, "... reunited into a single state enjoying equal rights within the framework of the Balkan Democratic Federation." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/dimitrov/works/1915/balkan.htm|title=''The Significance of the Second Balkan Conference''|author=Georgi Dimitrov|accessdate=August 2, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060904212109/http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/dimitrov/works/1915/balkan.htm| archivedate= 4 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This independent and united Macedonia would have consisted of the corresponding geographical departments of Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece. The leaders of the Federation were repressed by the Balkan governments at different intervals. Rakovsky was expelled from various Balkan countries and, during World War I, became a founding member of the Revolutionary Balkan Social Democratic Labor Federation. Later he made his way to Russia, where he joined the [[Bolshevik Party]] after the October Revolution in 1917, and subsequently Dimitrov, Kolarov, and Rakovsky became members of the [[Comintern]].

=== Balkan Communist Federation ===

After the [[October Revolution|Russian October Revolution]], a Balkan [[Communism|Communist]] Federation was formed in 1920–1921, and was influenced by [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s views on nationality (''see [[Proletarian internationalism]]''). It was a Communist umbrella organisation in which all the Communist parties in the Balkans were represented. It was dominated by the requirements imposed by the [[Soviet Union]] through the Comintern. It advocated a "Balkan Federative Republic" that would have included [[Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Greece]], and [[Turkey]]; some projects also involved [[Romania]], but most of them only envisaged its fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koutalis|first1=Vangelis|title=''Internationalism as an Alternative Political Strategy in the Modern History of Balkans''|url=http://www.okde.org/keimena/vag_kout_balkan_inter_0603_en.htm|website=Organization of Communist Internationalists of Greece–Spartacus|accessdate=25 April 2017|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body thus oversaw the activities of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] (BKP), the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ), the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE), the [[Communist Party of Turkey (historical)|Communist Party of Turkey]] (TKP), and, to a certain measure, those of the [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party of Romania]] (PCdR). It was disestablished in 1939.

In [[Sofia]], Bulgaria, May–June 1922, the question of the "autonomy of Macedonia, [[Dobruja]] and [[Thrace]]" was raised by [[Vasil Kolarov]] and was backed by Dimitrov, the Bulgarian delegate who presided over the meeting. The Greek delegate asked for a postponement as he was reluctant to approve a motion that was not on the agenda. In December 1923, the Balkan Communist Federation held its Fifth Conference in [[Moscow]]. In 1924 the Comintern entered negotiations about collaboration between the Communists and the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO), [[Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation]] (ITRO) and [[Internal Dobrujan Revolutionary Organisation]] (IDRO), and the creation of a united revolutionary movement. The idea for a new unified organization was supported by the Soviet Union, which saw a chance for using this well developed revolutionary movements to spread revolution in the Balkans and destabilize the Balkan monarchies.

The so-called [[May Manifesto]] of 6 May 1924 was issued in which the objectives of the unified Macedonian liberation movement were presented: independence and unification of partitioned Macedonia, fighting all the neighbouring Balkan monarchies, forming a Balkan Communist Federation and cooperation with the Soviet Union. In 1925, under the influence of the BKP, several left-wing splinter groups (the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]], the Dobrujan Revolutionary Organisation and the Internal Thracian Organization), respectively, seceded from the main organizations. These wings militated for their own Soviet Republics, which would be part of a "Balkan Communist Federation". The BKP was compelled by Stalin to endorse the formation of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]], Thracian, and [[Dobruja]]n nations in order to include those new separate states in the Balkan Communist Federation.&lt;ref name="Rothschild"&gt;{{cite book

It was accepted by the Political Secretariat in Moscow on January 11, 1934, and approved by the Executive Committee of the Comintern.

The KKE delegate Nikolaos Sargologos signed the motion without central authorisation; instead of returning to [[Athens]], he emigrated to the [[United States]]. The KKE political organ and newspaper, ''[[Rizospastis]]'', was against the motion because it saw it as good for the BKP in Bulgaria but disastrous for the KKE in Greece. The KKE found the BCF's position on Macedonia difficult but briefly went along with it. In June 1924, at its 5th meeting, it recognised "the Macedonian people" and in December 1924, it endorsed the motion for "a united and independent Macedonia and a united and independent Thrace" with the perspective of entering into a union within a Balkan federation "against the national and social yoke of the Greek and Bulgarian [[Bourgeois nationalism|bourgeoisie]]".

However, the KKE suffered a crushing defeat it the [[Greek legislative election, 1928|1928 Greek elections]], especially in Greek Macedonia. Dissentions within the KKE had already made the motion untenable by 1927, and in March, the KKE conference watered it down, calling for autodetermination of the Macedonians until they join a "Balkan [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] Socialist Federation" and only for "a section of Macedonia ([[Florina]] area) inhabited by Slavomacedonians&lt;ref&gt;(Holevas 1992). At the time the term "Slavomacedonian" was not considered offensive: the ''[[Greek Helsinki Monitor]]'' reports that the term, "was accepted by the community itself". However, today the term has pejorative connotations.&lt;/ref&gt;" By 1935, it simply called for "equal rights to all" due to the "change of the national composition of the Greek part of Macedonia" and hence because "the [[Leninism|Leninist]]–[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] principle of self-determination demands the substitution of the old slogan". The KPJ had its own problems and dissentions; fears of [[Serbianisation]] of the party and of the [[Vardar Banovina]], whose inhabitants felt closer (though not necessarily identified) to Bulgaria than the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The KPJ followed the KKE example in 1936. In 1936 the left wings of the IMRO, ITRO, and IDRO were incorporated by regional principle into the Balkan Communist Parties.

In [[Albania]], Communist ideas were mainly infiltrated by adjacent countries. Despite the effort of the Comintern to establish a Communist Party by sending and supporting emissaries as [[Kosta Boshnjaku]] and [[Ali Kelmendi]] later, Communist groups were not well organized, and they were weak. The Communist Party would be established only in 1941. Nevertheless, the contacts of the Albanians with Comintern were set way before. The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] had fixed the borders of Albania as defined pre-[[World War I]] by the [[London Conference of 1912–13]], leaving substantial Albanian-populated areas outside of its borders. At the same time, the country was dominated by during the early 1920s by an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] ruling class with no intention of addressing the country's sharp topics, including an agrarian reform and the fate of the Albanians left outside the borders.

In the early 1920s, two entities came in contact with the Comintern: the left-wing opposition led by Bishop [[Fan Noli]], and the [[Committee of Kosovo]]. [[Bajram Curri]], a [[Kosovar Albanian]] and key person of both, said in December 1921 to the Soviet minister in [[Vienna]] that "the Albanian people await impatiently the determination of their frontiers not on the basis of brutal and bloody historical considerations, but rather on the basis of the situation which actually exists today. With the firm conviction that Soviet Russia will be able in the near future to determine the boundaries of Europe, especially in the Balkans, in a just manner, I pray that the great Soviet government will grant our just requests at that time."&lt;ref&gt;Pano, Nicholas C. ''The People's Republic of Albania''. Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins Press. 1968. pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the failed [[June Revolution]], Noli and others settled in Vienna where they formed [[KONARE]] (Revolutionary National Committee), a left-wing revolutionary committee openly pro-Soviet. Though KONARE, but even by themselves, the Committee of Kosovo would join the Balkan Federation and receive financial support.&lt;ref name="Banac"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC&amp;pg=PA305 | author=Ivo Banac| title=The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics| isbn=  978-0-8014-9493-2| publisher=Cornell University Press  | year=1988|pages=305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Vllamasi |first1=Sejfi |last2 =Verli |first2 =Marenglen |title=Ballafaqime Politike në Shqipëri (1897–1942): Kujtime dhe Vlerësime Historike |year=2000 |location= Tirana| publisher =Shtëpia Botuese "Neraida"|isbn=99927-713-1-3 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9aC4AAAAIAAJ| quote=Një pjesë me rëndësi e emigrantëve, me inisiativën dhe ndërmjetësinë e Koço Boshnjakut, u muarrën vesh me "Cominternin", si grup, me emër "KONARE" (Komiteti Revolucionar Kombëtar), për t'u ndihmuar pa kusht gjatë aktivitetit të tyre nacional, ashtu siç janë ndihmuar edhe kombet e tjerë të vegjël, që ndodheshin nën zgjedhë të imperialistëve, për liri e për pavarësi.

This way any support for the Committee of Kosovo faded. The introduction of [[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]]'s interests in the equation completely disrupted any connection between Albanian nationalist-irredentist movements and the Comintern.&lt;ref name="Banac"/&gt; KONARE would also dissolve in the mid-1930s, leaving the Comintern with few scattered communists groups within Albania.

== Cominform period (1946–1948) ==

For a short period during the [[Cominform]], the Yugoslav and Bulgarian Communist leaders [[Josip Broz Tito]] and [[Georgi Dimitrov]] worked on a project to merge their two countries into a Balkan Federative Republic. As a concession to the Yugoslavian side, Bulgarian authorities agreed to the recognition of a distinct Macedonian ethnicity and language in part of their own population in the Bulgarian part of geographical Macedonia. This was one of the conditions of the [[Bled Agreement (1947)|Bled Agreement]], signed between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria on 1 August 1947. In November 1947, pressured by both the Yugoslavs and the Soviets, Bulgaria also signed a treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Niel Simpson, Macedonia; Its Disputed History, Aristoc Press. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pedro" /&gt; The Bulgarian president Georgi Dimitrov was sympathetic to the [[Macedonian Question]].&lt;ref name="Simpson"&gt;{{cite book

'''''Codex Ríos''''' is an Italian translation and augmentation of a Spanish colonial-era manuscript, [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]], that is partially attributed to Pedro de los Ríos, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Dominican friar|friar]] working in Oaxaca and Puebla between 1547 and 1562.  The [[codex]] itself was likely written and drawn in Italy after 1566.  

The manuscript is focused on the [[Tolteca-Chichimeca]] culture in the Tehuacan Valley in modern-day [[Puebla]] and [[Oaxaca]].  It can be divided into seven sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url=http://www.famsi.org/research/graz/vaticanus3738/|title=FAMSI - Akademische Druck - u.

:# Cosmological and mythological traditions with emphasis on the four epochs.
:# An almanac, or ''[[tonalamatl]]'', for the 260-day divinatory year common in [[Mesoamerica]].
:# Calendar tables for the years 1558 through 1619, without drawings.
:# An 18-month festival calendar, with drawings of the gods of each period.
:# Ritual customs, with portraits of Indians. 
:# Pictorial chronicles for the years 1195-1549 beginning with the migration from [[Chicomoztoc]] and covering later events in the [[Valley of Mexico]].
:# Glyphs for the years 1556 through 1562, without drawings or text. 

''Codex Ríos'' consists of 101 pages of European paper, accordion-folded.  It is held in the [[Vatican Library]], Rome, and is also variously known as '''Codex Vatican A''', '''Codex Vaticanus A''', and '''Codex Vaticanus 3738'''.

The '''Confederation of Unions for Professional and Managerial Staff in Finland'''&lt;ref&gt;Previously named ''Confederation of Unions for Academic Professionals in Finland''&lt;/ref&gt; ('''Akava''') is a [[trade union]] confederation in [[Finland]]. It represents employees with university-level, professional or other high-level training. It has a membership of 609,000.

Akava is a [[central organization]] i.e. the individual members are not personally members of Akava but of a [[trade union]] which is a member of Akava. Akava has 36 member unions, the largest of which are the [[Trade Union of Education in Finland]] (OAJ), the [[Finnish Association of Graduate Engineers]] (TEK), the [[Union of Professional Engineers in Finland]] UIL), the [[Finnish Association of Business School Graduates]] (SEFE) and [[w:fi:Tradenomiliitto|Tradenomiliitto]].
On 25 October 2011 Sture Fjäder was elected President of Akava for a four-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/artikler/portrett/portrait-2013-1/article.2013-11-05.5953976595/ |title=Sture Fjäder challenges Finland’s trade union culture |last=Lindén |first=Carl-Gustav |date=2013-11-07 |access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Akava is affiliated with the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], the [[Council of Nordic Trade Unions]], and the [[European Trade Union Confederation]].

Akava is one of the three central organizations representing Finnish employees, the other two being the [[Finnish Confederation of Salaried Employees]] (STTK) and the [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]] (SAK).

The '''Eritrean Catholic Eparchy of Segheneyti''' ({{lang-la|Eparchia Segheneitensis}}) is a [[Eritrean Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[eparchy]] located in the town of [[Segheneyti]] in [[Eritrea]]. It is a part of the [[ecclesiastical province]] of [[Eritrean Catholic Archeparchy of Asmara|Asmara]]. The eparchy follows the [[Alexandrian Rite]], and has a cathedral of [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael the Archangel]].

== History ==
On 24 February 2012, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] established the Eparchy of Segheneyti from the [[Eritrean Catholic Archeparchy of Asmara|Eparchy of Asmara]] and it became [[suffragan]] of the [[Ethiopian Catholic Archeparchy of Addis Abeba]].&lt;ref name=hierarchy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dsegh.html|title=Eparchy of Segheneyti (Ethiopian)|publisher=Catholic-Hierarchy|accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCatholic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/segh0.htm|title=Ethiopic Diocese of Segheneyti|publisher=Giga Catholic|accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the establishment of the autonomous ''[[sui iuris]]'' [[Eritrean Catholic Church]] by [[Pope Francis]] in January 2015, the Eparchy of Segheneyti became a suffragan the [[Eritrean Catholic Archeparchy of Asmara]].&lt;ref name="Eritrean Catholic Church"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/de/bollettino/pubblico/2015/01/19/0048/00098.html | title=Erezione della Chiesa Metropolitana sui iuris eritrea e nomina del primo Metropolita | publisher=[[Holy See Press Office]] | date=January 19, 2015 | accessdate=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>This was not a (country) "European Parliament" election, but the European Parliament election held in (country). There is even any consensus for conducting such a massive change throughtout all EP election articles? (P.S. It looks like there was some inconsistency in some articles previous to the change as well)</comment>

The '''flag of Akershus''' represents [[Akershus]] county, [[Norway]]. Designed by Finn Fagerli, it was approved by Royal Resolution on 11 December 1987. The flag is a banner of the [[Coat of arms of Akershus]] which is a silver [[Crow-stepped gable|step-gable]] on a blue field. It is rare among Norwegian flags in being square. The design is a reference to [[Akershus Fortress|Akershus Castle]] where several of the buildings feature such gables. The castle was the seat of the governor of Akershus [[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]], the predecessor of today's county.

==History==
[[File:Gabon Airlines Boeing 767-200 Volpati.jpg|thumb|Gabon Airlines Boeing 767-200, 13 August 2007]]
After having been granted official permission by the Gabonese transport minister on 8 November 2006, the airline was founded in 2007 by private investors, banks and insurers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panapress.com/freenews.asp?code=eng016040&amp;dte=28/03/2007 Panapress] 28 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] being Christian Bongo Ondimba, a son of former Gabonese president [[Omar Bongo]]. The first revenue flight of Gabon Airlines took place on 11 April 2007 and went from [[Libreville]] to [[Paris]].

The '''''Gibraltar Anthem''''' is the [[national song]] of the [[British overseas territories|British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]].

In common with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Crown dependencies]] and other British territories, the official national anthem of Gibraltar is [[God Save the Queen]]. The Gibraltar anthem is the national song, and was chosen in a competition in 1994. Both the [[lyrics]] and [[music]] were composed by [[Peter Emberley]], who is not a [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]].

The anthem is sung every 10 September by the general public at the annual release of 30,000 [[Flag of Gibraltar|red and white]] [[balloon]]s on [[Gibraltar National Day]].

==Lyrics==
&lt;poem&gt;Gibraltar, Gibraltar,
The Rock on which I stand,
May you be forever free,
Gibraltar, my own land.

Mighty pillar,
Rock of splendour,
Guardian of the sea,
Port of hope in times of need,
Rich in history.

Gibraltar, Gibraltar,
The Rock on which I stand,
May you be forever free,
Gibraltar my own land.

God give grace to this our homeland,
Help us to live as one,
Strong in freedom,
Truth and justice,
Let this be our song.

Gibraltar, Gibraltar,
The Rock on which I stand,
May you be forever free,
Gibraltar! Gibraltar!
My own land!&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Gnällbältet''', Swedish, "The whining belt", is an informal name referring to a [[geographic belt]] in central [[Sweden]] where the [[dialect]]s have certain features in common, mostly extensive usage of the [[schwa]] sound. The belt consists of [[Västmanland]], [[Närke]] and the western parts of [[Södermanland]], but are characteristic to a much reduced degree throughout the [[Mälaren Valley]].

The '''Gozo boat''' ({{lang-mt|Dgħajsa ta’ Għawdex, tal-latini, tat-tagħbija, tal-pass}} or {{lang|mt|tal-mogħdija}}) was a type of [[Settee (sail)|settee]]-rigged boat originating from [[Malta]]. Gozo boats were the main means of transport across the [[Gozo Channel]] between [[Gozo]] and the [[Malta (island)|main island of Malta]]&lt;ref name="morana"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morana|first1=Martin|title=Bejn Kliem u Storja|date=2011|publisher=Books Distributors Limited|location=[[Malta]]|isbn=978-99957-0137-6|url=https://sites.google.com/site/kliemustorja/home/titlu/introduzzjoni/dwar-l-awtur/a/b/c/c/d|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005162338/https://sites.google.com/site/kliemustorja/home/titlu/introduzzjoni/dwar-l-awtur/a/b/c/c/d|archivedate=5 October 2016|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt; from at least 1241 to the 1960s.

==History==
[[File:Malta Gozo boat-2-6.jpg|thumb|Gozo boat on a 1926 Maltese stamp]]

Gozo boats evolved from the speronara ({{lang-mt|xprunara}}), which was found all over the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref name="morana"/&gt; The oldest records of a transport link between Gozo and Malta date back to 1241, when the boat was known as a ''dgħajsa tal-mogħdija'' or ''tal-pass''. By the 16th century, Gozo boats took the shape of a [[brigantine]]. In the 1880s, many Gozo boats changed their sail arrangements to a [[Settee (sail)|settee]] rig. In 1919, engines began to be installed on some Gozo boats, although many still retained their sails.&lt;ref name=gozochannel&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muscat|first1=Joseph|title=The Gozo boat|url=http://www.gozochannel.com/gozoboat.htm|website=Gozo Channel Co. Ltd.|publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303053346/http://www.gozochannel.com/gozoboat.htm|archivedate=3 March 2012|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Gozo boats were built at [[Kalkara]] in the [[Grand Harbour]]. The Caruana family, who were the last builders of Gozo boats, moved from there to [[Mġarr, Gozo|Mġarr]] on Gozo in 1940. After 1959, a few Gozo boats were built in [[Gela]], [[Sicily]]. The last one to be built was the ''Santa Rita'' (G48) in 1963.&lt;ref name=gozochannel/&gt;

Gozo boats usually made trips from the Grand Harbour in Malta to Mġarr Harbour on Gozo. Other trips were made from the Grand Harbour to [[Mellieħa]] or to Marfa, or Mġarr to Marfa or [[St. Paul's Bay]]. The boats carried both passengers and cargo between the two islands. Trips from Gozo to Malta were generally loaded with agricultural products such as fruit, vegetables, eggs and poultry, while return trips from Malta to Gozo were loaded with manufactured goods such as cement, soft drinks and beer.&lt;ref name=letsgozo/&gt;

Gozo boats were painted in shades of green, blue, red and yellow, similar to the traditional ''[[luzzu]]''. One boat was painted black to carry corpses between the islands.&lt;ref name=letsgozo&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rites of passage|journal=Let's Gozo|date=June 2007|pages=16-17|url=http://www.wirtghawdex.org/news/media-articles/156-2007-rites-of-passage-let-s-gozo/file|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents===
There were a number of accidents involving Gozo boats. Some were hit by rifle fire while passing the [[Pembroke, Malta|Pembroke]] Rifle Ranges, although the authorities warned the boats' masters in advance. In 1900, a Gozo boat used that was being used for ''[[Mahi-mahi|lampuki]]'' fishing capsized, killing one fisherman. Another boat lost her masts in 1911, but it managed to enter St. George's Bay. In 1926, an unoccupied Gozo boat was found adrift in rough seas. In rare cases, they were involved in collisions with [[tugboat]]s or [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnaces]].&lt;ref name=gozochannel/&gt;

In [[World War II]], the boat ''Stella Maris'' was destroyed by enemy action.

===Decline===
By the 1960s and 1970s, regular steamer services began to compete with the Gozo boats, which were no longer suitable for the changing socio-economic situation. The remaining boats were converted into fishing boats, or were abandoned at Mġarr Harbour.&lt;ref name=gozochannel/&gt;

Since 1979, the Gozo ferry service has been operated by [[Gozo Channel Line|Gozo Channel Company Limited]], which now uses modern [[Roll-on/roll-off|RORO ferries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.gozochannel.com/en/history.htm|website=Gozo Channel Co. Ltd.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329140913/http://gozochannel.com/en/history.htm|archivedate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving examples==
[[File:Malta - Sliema (Triq Ix-Xatt (Gzira)) 09 ies.jpg|thumb|''Maryanne'']]

Very few Gozo boats still survive today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dougall|first1=Angelo|title=The Gozo Boat - Extinction of a breed|journal=L-Imnara|date=August 1983|volume=2|issue=1|pages=13-15|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/L-Imnara/L-Imnara.%2002(1983)1=6/10s.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2015|publisher=Għaqda tal-Folklor}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these is the ''Sacra Famiglia'' (G32), which was built in [[Kalkara]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Id-Dgħajsa Tal-Latini to dominate Mġarr Harbour again|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2011-08-08/news/id-dg-and-295ajsa-tal-latini-to-dominate-m-and-289arr-harbour-again-296889/|accessdate=25 July 2015|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had become unseaworthy by the 1970s, and was beached at [[Mġarr, Gozo|Mġarr]]. The hulk was eventually purchased by a private individual who wanted to sell it to the Ministry for Gozo. It was then purchased by the [[Gozo Channel Line|Gozo Channel Company Limited]], who handed it to [[Wirt Għawdex]] and sponsored its restoration. After the boat was restored by the Caruana brothers (the sons of its original builder), it was placed on permanent display at the Żewwieqa promenade in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dgħajsa Tal-Latini|url=http://www.wirtghawdex.org/component/k2/dg%C4%A7ajsa-tal-latini|website=[[Wirt Għawdex]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725142320/http://www.wirtghawdex.org/component/k2/dg%C4%A7ajsa-tal-latini|archivedate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Dghajsa Tal-Latini’ fully restored &amp; on display at the Zewwieqa Waterfront|url=http://gozonews.com/53284/dghajsa-tal-latini-fully-restored-on-display-at-the-zewwieqa-waterfront/|accessdate=25 July 2015|work=Gozo News|date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another surviving Gozo boat is the ''Maryanne'', which was built in Gela in 1960. The boat remained in Gozo until February 1983, when it was purchased by Captain Morgan Cruises. The boat still belongs to Captain Morgan, and it is used for cruises around [[Marsamxett Harbour|Marsamxett]] and the [[Grand Harbour]]. ''Maryanne'' is in good condition, but it no longer has the distinctive masts and a deck has been added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maryanne |url=http://www.captainmorgan.com.mt/maryanne |website=Captain Morgan Cruises |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027092831/http://www.captainmorgan.com.mt/maryanne |archivedate=27 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another two or three Gozo boats which were converted into fishing boats might still exist.&lt;ref name=gozochannel/&gt;

[[Image:GreatSouthBasinNZ.PNG|thumb|right|Approximate location of the Great South Basin with approximate location of allocated Oil Exploration Blocks]]

The '''Great South Basin''' is an area of mainly sea to the south of the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]].

Starting in the 1960s, the area was explored and drilled for oil deposits by various, mostly international minerals companies — including [[Hunt Oil]] — but by 1984 all of these companies had left empty-handed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crownminerals.govt.nz/cms/pdf-library/petroleum-basins-1/gsb-media-pack/GSB%20Timeline.pdf Crown Minerals - Great South Basin Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

With advances in seismic surveying and drilling technology, hopes have been raised once again for a potential oil strike. Since 2006, new tenders for drilling rights have been issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0607/S00547.htm Bidding opens for oil and gas in Great South Basin]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Exxon Mobil]] and [[Todd Energy]] relinquished their exploration rights, citing technical difficulties and the harshness of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10679766 |title=Exxon Mobil abandons Great South Basin|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Dutch Shell]] subsequently purchased a stake in a joint venture headed by [[OMV]] New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/5453456/ |title=Shell-joins-southern-oil-hunt Shell joins southern oil hunt |publisher=BusinessDay.co.nz |date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with drilling announced at the start of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/9584446/Shell-proceeds-with-Great-South-Basin-drilling|title=Shell proceeds with Great South Basin drilling|date=2014-01-07|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Anadarko Petroleum Corporation]] made a test drilling in the area in early 2014, without success.&lt;ref name=anadarko&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/257767/greenpeace-hits-out-at-prospect-plan|title=Greenpeace hits out at prospect plan|date=2014-10-25|publisher=Radio New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schlumberger]] subsequently made a drilling attempt in the same areas later in the year.&lt;ref name=anadarko /&gt;

==Formation==
The Intergovernmental Authority on Development was established in 1996. It succeeded the earlier Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD), a multinational body founded in 1986 by Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda and Kenya, with a focus on development and environmental control. IGADD's headquarters were later moved to Djibouti, following an agreement signed in January 1986 by the member states. Eritrea joined the organization in 1993, upon achieving independence.&lt;ref name="Igadau"&gt;{{cite web|title=IGAD - About us|url=http://www.igad.int/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=93&amp;Itemid=124|publisher=Intergovernmental Authority on Development|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1995, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government met in [[Addis Ababa]], where they agreed to strengthen cooperation through the organization. This was followed with the signing of a Letter of Instrument to Amend the IGADD Charter / Agreement on 21 March 1996. The Revitalised IGAD, a new organizational structure, was eventually launched on 25 November 1996 in Djibouti.&lt;ref name="Igadau"/&gt;

==IGASOM/AMISOM==
{{Politics of the African Union mini|financial|width=5em}}
{{main|AMISOM}}
In September 2006, the AU Peace and Security Council approved an IGAD proposal to deploy an IGAD Peace Support Mission in Somalia (IGASOM).&lt;ref name="Sauerpp"&gt;{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: African Union endorses regional peace plan|url=http://ports.co.za/news/article_2006_09_15_3438.html#five|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=IRIN|date=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2007, the [[United Nations Security Council]] approved Resolution 1744, which authorized the deployment of a new [[African Union Mission to Somalia]] (AMISOM) in place of IGASOM.&lt;ref name="UN_SRES17442007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution 1744 (2007)|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/1744.pdf|publisher=United Nations Security Council|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation==
*IGAD is a principal supporter of the [[Federal Government of Somalia]] through the AMISOM initiative.
*IGAD expanded its activities in 2008 with initiatives to improve the investment, trade and banking environments of member states. The organization stressed the deployment of highly innovative programmes and mechanisms.

==Structure==
*The '''Assembly of Heads of State and Government''' is the supreme policy making organ of the Authority. It determines the objectives, guidelines and programs for IGAD and meets once a year. A Chairman is elected from among the member states in rotation.
*The '''Secretariat''' is headed by an Executive Secretary appointed by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government for a term of four years renewable once. The Secretariat assists member states in formulating regional projects in the priority areas, facilitates the coordination and harmonization of development policies, mobilizes resources to implement regional projects and programs approved by the Council and reinforces national infrastructures necessary for implementing regional projects and policies. The current Executive Secretary is Eng. Mahboub Maalim of Kenya (since 14 June 2008).
*The '''Council of Ministers''' is composed of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and one other Minister designated by each member state. The Council formulates policy, approves the work program and annual budget of the Secretariat during its biannual sessions.
*The '''Committee of Ambassadors''' comprises IGAD member states' Ambassadors or Plenipotentiaries accredited to the country of IGAD Headquarters. It convenes as often as the need arises to advise and guide the Executive Secretary.

==Career and impact==
Schloss is a researcher at the Argentinian Antarctic Institute (IAA) and is a Correspondent Researcher of the National Council of the Research (CONICET) of Argentina.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She has been an associate professor at [[Université du Québec à Rimouski|UQAR]] since 2009, and was a research assistant there since 2008.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her research focusses on the impact of UVB radiation on plankton communities at a range of latitudes, the role of phytoplankton on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere and the effects of global change on coastal plankton.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ismer.ca/Schloss-Irene-R?lang=fr|title=Schloss, Irene R.|website=www.ismer.ca|publisher=Institut des sciences de la mer de Rimouski|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has research expertise in the dynamics of high latitude marine plankton and variations of plankton communities in space and time. Schloss has participated in nine expeditions to Antarctica (ship-based and on Argentinean stations), spending around 17 months in the sixth continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/srp/ant-era#Carlini16|title=Studying the effect of warming oceans and glacier melting on Antarctic plankton.|last=|first=|website=www.scar.org|publisher=Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her greatest impact has been in research on the interactions the adaptation and effects of plankton to ocean climate change. Her work has modelled physical-biological interactions during bloom dynamics in coastal Antarctica, in particular the equilibrium between warming, glacier melt water and wind-induced physical turbulence in coastal waters. Her work on the role of plankton groups on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dynamics indicated that [[diatoms]] are key contributors to atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake in surface waters, providing a direct link between biodiversity and climate-relevant processes. Additionally, her work demonstrated links between large-scale atmospheric phenomena (e.g. [[Southern Annular Mode]] and [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]]) and local phytoplankton dynamics.

Schloss plays a central role in the development of international collaborations in Antarctic research.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She has been successful in working in polar science in different countries, such as Argentina, Canada, and Germany through the promotion and participation in numerous international research projects and initiatives, cooperating with researchers from USA, Spain, Belgium, Brazil, Poland, and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imconet.eu/about-the-project/work-packages/wp-2.html|title=Climate change effects on coastal polar environments and on planktonic communities|website=imconet.eu|publisher=Interdisciplinary Modelling of Climate Change in Coastal Western Antarctica Network|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further participates in the development of the Antarctic Environmental Portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.environments.aq/information-summaries/vulnerability-of-southern-ocean-biota-to-climate-change/|title=Vulnerability of Southern Ocean biota to climate change|website=www.environments.aq|publisher=Antarctic Environments Portal|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is particularly involved in the promotion of Antarctic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/antera/antera-about|title=Antarctic Thresholds - Ecosystem Resilience and Adaptation|last=|first=|website=www.scar.org|publisher=Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She participated at the SCAR Horizon SCAN in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/horizonscan/retreat/attendees|title=Horizon Scan Retreat|last=|first=|date=2014|website=www.scar.org|publisher=Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== HISTORY ==
Iskra developed from the SPRAD and a modest factory in Kranj / Strojne tovarne Kranj, a former subsidiary of the Luftfahrtgerätewerk, Berlin. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Predan |first1=Barbara |last2=Požar |first2=Cvetka |title=Iskra non-aligned design 1946-1990 |date=2009 |publisher=Arhitekturni muzej Ljubljana |location=Ljubljana |isbn=978-961-6669-10-8 |url=http://iskra46-90.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=4 |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirjan_Gruden prof. dr. Mirjan Gruden] renamed Strojne tovarne Kranj to Iskra (in Slovenian: Spark) using words: "The factory will develop and grow; from a spark, a flame is born, let our iskra start a flame. As electrical technicians, we are always dealing with sparks in our profession. A spark is a symbol for the start of a process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perko |first1=Borut |title=Iskra zapustila Gorenjsko |url=https://www.slovenskenovice.si/novice/slovenija/iskra-zapustila-gorenjsko |website=Slovenske novice |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company, which quickly became synonymous with quality, reliability, and modernity, got its own recognisable symbol. A symbol that most likely originates in marks used by guilds, which guaranteed the origin and control of quality and quantity of products, thus completing the symbolic meaning of the newly-formed brand, which goes beyond the basic concept of the company and acts as a unique reflection of the times.

One year after it was established, Iskra developed its first switch, followed by its first FM antenna, capacitor, and then one of the key milestones in Iskra’s success – establishment of its design department. In 1962, this was the first industrial design department in Yugoslavia. Iskra was very serious about design, considering it a strategic elements, and acted according to the principle that the development constructor and the industrial designer must collaborate closely throughout the product development. The company statute from that year already stated that every product must be of high quality, but also reasonably priced and appropriately aesthetically designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iskra's Strategic Milestones |url=https://www.iskra.eu/en/Iskras-Strategic-Milestones/ |website=Iskra.eu |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perko |first1=Borut |title=Iskra zapustila Gorenjsko |url=https://www.slovenskenovice.si/novice/slovenija/iskra-zapustila-gorenjsko |website=Slovenske novice |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iskra continued with its development, and presented its first systemic solution in 1964. The bureau for railway automation, BAŽ, was founded.

In the 1970s, Iskra developed into the largest Yugoslavian company for [[electromechanics]], [[telecommunications]], [[electronics]] and [[automation]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iskra46-90.com/za_medije/PR_ISKRA_gradivo.pdf |title=Pregledna razstava Iskra: Neuvrščeno oblikovanje 1946-1990 |language=Slovenian |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; proving itself time and time again with exceptional industrial design in telephony, measuring instruments, and machinery. At the start of the 1990s, Iskra’s logo was on all electrical devices, and our product portfolio was expanded with measuring instruments, short-wave navy radio receivers, drilling machines, movie projectors, etc.

In 1989, Iskra SOZD consisted of the following organizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Iskra: Vodič po Iskri | year=1989 | publisher=Iskra Commerce, dejavnost marketinških raziskav in komuniciranja | place=Ljubljana, Slovenia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kfm''' is an [[Radio in Ireland|Irish radio station]] based in [[Naas]], serving [[County Kildare]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref name="bci operator"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bci.ie/licensed_operators/local_radio_kfm.html |title=Licensed Operators: Kfm |publisher=bci.ie |accessdate=29 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115065924/http://www.bci.ie/licensed_operators/local_radio_kfm.html |archivedate=15 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kfm broadcasts on 97.6fm and 97.3fm to all parts of county Kildare 24 hours a day from the state-of-the-art Kfm Broadcast Centre, Newhall, Naas, Co. Kildare and around the world on its website and IPhone and Android apps.

It began broadcasting in 2004, having won a ten-year franchise for the county from the [[Broadcasting Commission of Ireland]]. Kildare had previously been part of a combined franchise with [[County Carlow]] and was served by [[CKR FM]], who did not get their licence renewed.

The station, with a contemporary format, caters for an audience from 15+ upwards.

In January 2014, Kfm was successful in the renewal of its broadcast licence by the BAI for another 10-year term.

Kfm transmitters are based on Slive Thuile, County Dublin - to serve the north of Kildare on 97.6Fm and in Rossmore, Co. Laois to serve the south of the county on 97.3FM.

Kfm's broadcast area is the most station saturated in the Republic of Ireland, primarily due to the close proximity to Dublin City.

Despite the intense competition, for the period from April 2013 to March 2014, Kfm is the most listened to radio station across the week in county Kildare&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipsos/mrbi/jnlr{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station has been nominated for a number of PPI awards and in 2011 won the FAI’s Communications Award (Radio).

Company CEO: Clem Ryan; Programme Director: Paul Power, Sales Manager: Bertie McDermott: News Editor: Ciara Plunkett

The station’s major shareholder is renowned horse trainer Dermot Weld.  Other shareholders and/or directors include company chairman accountant Bernard Hurley; Kfm CEO Clem Ryan; Managing Director of Mongey Communications; Naas David Mongey; 4FM CEO and majority shareholder of East Coast FM Sean Ashmore; Managing Director of the National Ploughing Association Anna May McHugh; Dermot Weld Racing General Manager Mark Weld; and The Buggyman, Kill, Managing Director Liam Ross.

'''Korbáčik''' (IPA: [korbaːt͡ʃik]) is a type of semi-hard or medium hard [[string cheese]]. It originates from the [[Orava (region)|Orava]] region of northern [[Slovakia]]. It is made from [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]] cheese interwoven into fine braids. The name roughly translates to "little [[whip]]" which refers to the pattern woven onto the strings.

== Content ==
There are two main variants of the Korbáčik, the smoked and the un-smoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korbáčiky|url=http://paulinescookbook.wordpress.com/2011/07/30/korbaciky/|publisher=Paulines cookbook|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these, it is not uncommon to produce salty variants, as well as with [[garlic]]. The basis for the production is milk, either from cow or from sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cerven|first=Jozef|title=Ako sa robia Oravske Korbaciky|url=http://cerven.blog.sme.sk/c/66246/Ako-sa-robia-oravske-korbaciky.html|publisher=sme.sk|accessdate=7 August 2013|language=Slovak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Médecins du monde''''' (MdM; {{IPA-fr|medsɛ̃ dy mɔ̃d}}) or '''Doctors of the World,''' provides emergency and long-term medical care to the world's most vulnerable people. It also advocates to end health inequities.

It was founded in 1980 by a group of 15 French physicians, including [[Bernard Kouchner]]. It works in both the developed and developing world.

==History==
MdM was formally established on 1 February 1980. Its goals were "[http://www.medecinsdumonde.org/qui-sommes-nous/notre-histoire#sthash.J4OlB4qQ.dpuf to go where others will not, to testify to the intolerable, and to volunteer"].

Its origins lay in a 1979 intervention to assist a drifting boat of Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea.  Kouchner, with volunteer doctors, journalists, and others organized a hospital boat, [http://www.la-croix.com/Actualite/Monde/Grace-a-l-Ile-de-Lumiere-des-milliers-de-Vietnamiens-ont-reconstruit-leur-vie-2013-08-08-996240 L'Île de lumière], to provide medical care and to report the refugees' suffering.

MdM was founded as Bernard Kouchner and 14 others doctors split from the group he previously founded, [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Medecins Sans Frontiers]] (MSF, or Doctors Without Borders). It has been reported Kouchner felt that MSF was giving up its founding principle of ''témoignage'' ("witnessing"), which refers to aid workers making the atrocities they observe known to the public.

Kouchner was president of MdM from 1980 to 1982. In 1989, the foundation of MdM Spain paved the way for the creation of the MdM international network. In 2015, the MdM global network consisted of fifteen associations;  France (founded 1980), Spain (founded 1989), Greece (founded 1990), Italy and Switzerland (both founded 1993), Sweden (founded 1994), [[Cyprus]] (founded 1995 by [[Elena Theoharous]]&lt;ref name="irishT_MdM"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | pages= | language =| title=Aid mission: boat departs Cyprus | date=2008-12-30 | work=[[Irish Times]] | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2008/1230/1230581468701.html |accessdate=2008-12-31 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5dSrxJum5 |archivedate=2008-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Argentina]] (founded 1998), Belgium, Canada and Portugal (all founded 1999), as well as in Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, the Netherlands, and the USA.

==Doctors of the World USA==

Doctors of the World USA, also known as MdM USA, was founded in 1990 by famous doctor and activist [[Jonathan Mann (WHO official)|Jonathan Mann]]. The group ultimately separated from the MdM network in 2006, and became [[HealthRight International]].

[http://www.doctorsoftheworld.org Doctors of the World USA] is the 15th chapter of the MDM network. It was re-founded by committed humanitarian activists in 2011, with Dr Abby Stoddard as its founding chair. Since 2016, Fraser Mooney is the Executive Director.

== Doctors of the World UK ==
In 1998, Doctors of the World UK became a registered charity in England and Wales and initially only contributed to Médecins du Monde international work.   It launched its UK Programme in 2006, when they opened [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/27/doctors-of-the-world-guardian-observer-charity-appeal-2015 a clinic in Bethnal Green], in east London. The clinic provides information and medical assistance to people who cannot access mainstream health services, such as undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and the homeless. 

After the Ebola crisis West Africa in 2014, it helped run [http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2015/09/21/andy-young-and-sarah-collis-the-real-ebola-heroes-will-not-be-getting-medals/ a treatment centre] in Moyamba, Sierra Leone. DOTW UK volunteer Professor Bulstrode was [https://www.bma.org.uk/news/2016/january/doctors-honoured-in-fight-against-ebola awarded a CBE] for his involvement in the Ebola crisis. It is currently providing healthcare for refugees and migrants in [https://www.doctorsoftheworld.org.uk/pages/international-work several countries in Europe], including Greece and Croatia, and [https://www.doctorsoftheworld.org.uk/blog/entry/the-people-are-scared-helping-those-left-behind-by-ukraines-forgotten- Ukraine].

Drs. [[Chris van Tulleken|Chris]] and Xand van Tulleken, who present the CBBC series ''[[Operation Ouch!]]'', are [http://www.vantullekenbrothers.com/dow/ Board Members of DOTW UK].

==Operations==

MdM programs focus on [[Médecins du Monde#Initiatives|'''four priority areas''']]: Conflict and Crisis, Harm Reduction, Maternal and Child Health, and Migrant Populations.

It works wherever there is war, natural disasters, disease, famine, poverty or exclusion. In 2018, Doctors of the World (MdM) provided care in 79 countries with over 300 programs in North and South America, Europe, Africa and Asia.

[http://old.medecinsdumonde.org/gb/Publications/Rapport-Moral-2014 In 2015, MdM had more than 300 projects in more than 80 countries]. In contrast to many other humanitarian NGOs, MdM worked in both developed and developing countries, and ran both emergency and long-term development projects.

==Financial Model==

In 2018, the Doctors of the World international network had a budget of some 250 million euros, and provided services to more than 6.5 million people worldwide. It allocated 78.5% of its budget to programs.15.5% to fundraising, and 6% to operating expenses.

==Surveillance by British and American intelligence agencies revealed==

In December 2013, documents released by [[National Security Agency]] whistle blower [[Edward Snowden]] revealed that British and American intelligence agencies had been carrying on secret surveillance of several humanitarian organizations including Médecins du Monde.  Leigh Daynes, Executive Director of Doctors of the World UK said that he was "bewildered by these extraordinary allegations of secret surveillance. Our doctors, nurses and midwives are not a threat to national security. There is absolutely no reason for our operations to be secretly monitored."  Other humanitarian organizations targeted include the [[United Nations]] Development Programme, the children's charity [[UNICEF]], and the head of the [[Economic Community of West African States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/20/gchq-targeted-aid-agencies-german-government-eu-commissioner GCHQ and NSA targeted charities, Germans, Israeli PM and EU chief | UK news | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015-16, the [[Arctic Council]] marked its 20th anniversary; the Arctic Economic Council opened its secretariat in [[Tromso]] and adopted its foundational documents; and the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty within the [[Antarctic Treaty System]] celebrated the 25th anniversary of the [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] that set aside [[Antarctica]] as a "natural reserve, devoted to peace and science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2016/09/30/the-arctic-council-at-20/|title=The Arctic Council at 20|first=Radio Canada|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barentsobserver.com/en/arctic/2015/09/arctic-council-aims-boost-business-09-09|title=Arctic Council aims for boost in business|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2016/10/08/antarctica-celebrates-25th-anniversary-of-the-environment-protection-protocol|title=Antarctica celebrates 25th anniversary of the Environment Protection Protocol|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[United Kingdom]] itself, the Polar Regions continued to elicit considerable interest, with the ongoing commemoration of the centenary of Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 2014-2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shackleton100.org|title=Shackleton 100 Events|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2016/05/20/shackleton-centenary-thanksgiving-service|title=Shackleton Centenary Thanksgiving Service|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2015-10-08/shackletons-granddaughter-opens-centenary-exhibition/|title=Shackleton's granddaughter opens centenary exhibition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the online poll by the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] for a name for the newly commissioned [[Royal Research Ship]] that saw [[Boaty McBoatface]] emerge as the most popular suggestion before it was named [[RRS Sir David Attenborough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/world/europe/boaty-mcboatface-what-you-get-when-you-let-the-internet-decide.html|title=Boaty McBoatface: What You Get When You Let the Internet Decide|date=22 March 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/17/boaty-mcboatface-wins-poll-to-name-polar-research-vessel|title=Boaty McBoatface wins poll to name polar research vessel|first=Hannah|last=Ellis-Petersen|date=17 April 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36225652|title='Boaty McBoatface' polar ship named after Attenborough|date=6 May 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; December 2015 also witnessed the historic [[Paris Agreement]] reached by 195 government delegations at the 2015 [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35084374|title=COP21 climate change summit reaches deal in Paris|date=13 December 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founding ===

'''Polar Research and Policy Initiative''' was founded by Dr Dwayne Ryan Menezes and Mr Christophe Milhères in 2015-2016 as the UK's first policy think-tank dedicated primarily to the [[Arctic]] and the [[Antarctic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://knr.gl/da/nyheder/britisk-tænketank-afviser-være-partisk=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was incorporated in [[England and Wales]] in September 2015, six months after their return from [[Greenland]], and launched in February 2016 at a private reception held at the [[Travellers Club]] in [[London]], with [[Aleqa Hammond]], the former [[Prime Minister of Greenland]], and [[Andrew Rosindell]], Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Romford]] and Founder and former Chair of the [[All-Party Parliamentary Group]] on Polar Regions, as speakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://knr.gl/da/nyheder/%EF%BB%BFaleqa-hammond-medlem-af-ny-arktisk-tænketank&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://knr.gl/da/nyheder/britisk-tænketank-afviser-være-partisk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sermitsiaq.ag/aleqa-medlem-ny-arktisk-taenketank|title=Aleqa medlem af ny arktisk tænketank|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the attendees were [[Kamalesh Sharma]], [[Commonwealth Secretary-General]]; Captain Ashok Mahapatra, Director of the Maritime Safety Division of the [[International Maritime Organization]]; Stefan Asmundssen, President of the [[North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission]]; [[Donald Lamont]], Chairman of the [[UK Antarctic Heritage Trust]] and former Governor of the [[Falkland Islands]] and Commissioner of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]; and [[Jock Wishart]], polar explorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sermitsiaq.ag/kl/issittoq-pillugu-isumalioqatigiissitami-nutaami-aleqa-ilaasortaassaaq|title=Issittoq pillugu isumalioqatigiissitami nutaami Aleqa ilaasortaassaaq|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avalanneq.dk/arktisk_er_ikke%20et_free_for_al_anliggende.htm#xl_xr_page_.|title=.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its web portal '''Polar Connection''' was launched thereafter in July 2016.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2016-07/jul18_16briefs.html|title=News Briefs|first=Northern News|last=Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current Status ===

The [[Mission statement|mission]] of PRPI, as stated on its website, is "to:
* raise the profile and understanding of the Polar Regions in the UK and across the Commonwealth;
* support polar researchers and polar research institutions in maximising the visibility, impact and reach of their research;
* increase and sustain the scholarly, cultural, political and commercial engagement of the UK and relevant Commonwealth member states with the Polar Regions (especially the Arctic Council member states);
* help address some of the toughest political, social, economic and environmental challenges facing polar peoples and places;
* facilitate greater bilateral trade and investment between Arctic states and Commonwealth member states."&lt;ref name=prpi-mission&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://polarconnection.org/about/mission/ |title=Mission |publisher=Polar Research and Policy Initiative |accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past two years, its focus has gradually expanded: while PRPI had a very clear [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations]] focus at the start, this has expanded to include, over the first six months, the [[United States]] and, after the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016]] (popularly known as [[Brexit]]), the rest of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arcticjournal.com/press-releases/2153/former-prime-minister-greenland-aleqa-hammond-launches-uks-first-polar-regions|title=Former Prime Minister of Greenland, Aleqa Hammond, launches UK’s first ‘Polar Regions’ Think-tank|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it positions itself as a UK-based international think-tank that operates principally in the international arena. Furthermore, at the time of its inception, PRPI engaged with different geographic constituencies through four engagement forums, dealing with the [[Asia Pacific]], [[European Union]], [[Small Island Developing States]] and [[World Ocean]] respectively.&lt;ref name="polarconnection.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polarconnection.org/engagement-forum/|title=Engagement Forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2016 Arctic Circle Assembly, it also introduced a new [[BRICS]] engagement forum.&lt;ref name="polarconnection.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polarconnection.org/brics/|title=BRICS Engagement Forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

Since its inception, PRPI's most defining features have been the provision of research, analysis and commentary; high-level engagement with policymakers, industry leaders, academics and Indigenous representatives; ongoing dialogue with national governments and multilateral fora; and active participation at national and international conferences. It has also aligned its principal activities with the key priorities of the incumbent Chairs of the [[Arctic Council]]: the [[United States]], 2015-2017, on "improving economic and living conditions in Arctic communities";&lt;ref name="2009-2017.state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/e/oes/ocns/opa/arc/uschair/index.htm=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Finland]], 2017-2019, in "exploring[ing] how the Agenda 2030 framework [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development] can be used in Arctic cooperation for the benefit of humans and nature".&lt;ref name="2009-2017.state.gov"/&gt;

=== Research, Analysis and Commentary ===

PRPI publishes its research and provides analysis and commentary both via its digital platform '''Polar Connection''' (www.polarconnection.org) and through partner platforms such as '''Arctic Today''' and other national and international media outlets. PRPI Fellows also make their research available through monographs, book chapters in edited volumes and research papers in journals. Its research interests are reflected in its organisational structure, which features three [[division (business)|divisions]]: [[theme (linguistics)|theme]]-specific units; [[industry]]-specific units; and [[stakeholder engagement]] forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polarconnection.org|title=The Polar Connection - Home of Polar Research and Policy Initiative|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stakeholder Engagement ===

PRPI positions itself as the nexus between stakeholders in policy, industry, academia, civil society and the media, and it provides a platform for dialogue and cooperation between different stakeholders. It does so in a variety of ways:

==== Parliamentary Evidence, Policy Briefs and Industry Briefs ====

PRPI has regularly provided written and oral evidence to relevant UK Parliamentary inquiries, such as:

* UK House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, 'Leaving the EU: Negotiating Priorities for Energy and Climate Change Policy Inquiry';&lt;ref&gt;http://data.parliament.uk/WrittenEvidence/CommitteeEvidence.svc/EvidenceDocument/Business,%20Energy%20and%20Industrial%20Strategy/Leaving%20the%20EU%20energy%20and%20climate%20negotiation%20priorities/written/44557.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmbeis/909/909.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

PRPI also provides policy briefs and industry briefs, when requested, to policymakers and industry leaders.

==== Missions and Delegations ====

PRPI also sends missions or delegations to brief national governments and intergovernmental bodies about various Arctic, Nordic and Antarctic issues or the ongoing work of PRPI. In September 2016, its founder, Dr Dwayne Menezes, represented PRPI at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and was invited to attend the UN Paris Climate Change Agreement Ratification Ceremony in [[New York City]] as a Civil Society Observer. In its early years, PRPI delegations were also received by the Executive Secretary of the [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]] in [[Buenos Aires]]; the Executive Office of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations]] in [[New York City|New York]]; the [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] at the [[White House]], the [[United States Department of State]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[National Science Foundation]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] in [[London]]; the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)]] in [[Canberra]]; [[Global Affairs Canada]], [[Senate of Canada]] and [[Government of Newfoundland and Labrador]]; the [[Prime Minister's Office (Finland)]] and [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)]] in [[Helsinki]]; the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)]] in [[Copenhagen]]; the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iceland)]] in [[Reykjavik]]; among others.

With respect to conferences, PRPI has sent delegations to, or convened policy dialogues at, the Arctic Circle Assemblies organised by [[Arctic Circle (organization)]] in [[Reykjavik]] in October 2015, October 2016 and October 2017; the Arctic Circle Forums hosted by the same organisation in [[Edinburgh]] in November 2017 and [[Tórshavn]] in May 2018; the Arctic Encounter Symposia held in the margins of the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Paris]] in December 2015 and in [[Seattle]] in April 2018; the Arctic Spirit Conference hosted in [[Rovaniemi]] in November 2017; the [[Ramboll]] Arctic Roundtable in [[Portland, Maine]] in December 2016; the [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] Arctic Science Conference convened in [[Sheffield]] in September 2015 and Antarctic Science Conference in [[Norfolk]] in July 2016; the Antarctica 100 Annual Meeting at the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in [[London]] in November 2015; the Arctic Future Symposium hosted by the [[International Polar Foundation]] in [[Brussels]] in November 2015; and the Arctic Science Summit Week and Arctic Observing Summit held in [[Fairbanks]] in April 2016 and [[Davos]] in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arctic.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/sites/8/2015/01/UK-ARCTIC-SCIENCE-CONFERENCE-2015_Book-of-Abstracts_14.09.15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polarconnection.org/advisory-board/#filter=*|title=Advisory Board|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy Dialogues ===

Annually, PRPI hosts 50-60 events around the world, ranging from lectures, panel discussions, roundtable discussions, workshops, conferences, policy breakfasts and dinners, and receptions for visiting dignitaries.

==== High-Level Dialogues on SDGs in the Arctic ====

PRPI has been widely credited for ensuring the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] remain high on the policy agenda of [[Arctic Council]] member and observer governments, and for bringing about a re-articulation of the global [[Arctic]] discourse along the lines of the 17 Global Goals. It is particularly known for its high-level, multi-stakeholder dialogues on SDGs in the Arctic, which have been convened thus far at the Arctic Circle Assembly at [[Harpa (concert hall)]] in [[Reykjavik]], [[Iceland]], in October 2017;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticcircle.org/assemblies/2015/breakout-sessions/session/sustainable-development-goals-sdgs-and-the-arctic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/session-1-sdgs-arctic/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lapland University of Applied Sciences]] in [[Rovaniemi]], [[Finland]], in November 2017;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rovaniemiarcticspirit.fi/EN/Program/Side-Events&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/sdgs-arctic-finland/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trent University]] in [[Peterborough, Ontario]], [[Canada]], in December 2017;&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/sdgs-arctic-trent-canada/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.trentu.ca/bess/news-events/20191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.trentu.ca/about/news-events/19949&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Institute of International Affairs]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]], in January 2018;&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/sdgs-arctic-australia/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/news-item/sdgs-arctic/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], in February 2018;&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/sdgs-arctic-london-uk/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/global-governance/ggi-events/sdgs-arctic&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]] in [[Boston]], [[United States]], in March 2018;&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/sdgs-arctic-us-boston/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.tufts.edu/fletcherarctic/2018-conference-agenda/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://tuftsdaily.com/news/2018/03/12/fletcher-arctic-vii-conference-speaks-science-diplomacy-sustainability/&lt;/ref&gt; Arctic Encounter Symposium in [[Seattle]], [[United States]], in April 2018;&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/sdgs-arctic-us-seattle/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticencounter.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jsis.washington.edu"&gt;https://jsis.washington.edu/canada/news/canadian-studies-center-polar-research-policy-initiative-host-high-level-dialogue-arctic-transportation/&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Tromsø]] in [[Tromsø]], [[Norway]], in April 2018;&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/sdgs-arctic-norway/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mediasite.uit.no/Mediasite/Catalog/Full/8c538b09e5664529a5eaf614db19756f21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mereconomics.com/2018/05/04/sustainable-development-goals-in-the-arctic-sustainable-arctic-tourism/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordregio.org/events/nordregio-joins-8th-high-level-dialogue-in-tromso/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publicnow.com/view/9A9B00B71E413959662B58A9D2B147B9C17F374E?2018-04-27-11:30:25+01:00-xxx9046&lt;/ref&gt; Arctic Circle Forum in [[Tórshavn]], [[Faroe Islands]], in May 2018;&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/sdgs-arctic-faroe-islands/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticcircle.org/forums/faroeislands&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] in [[New Delhi]], [[India]], in June 2018.

==== Dialogues on Arctic Border Governance ====

In June 2017, PRPI co-hosted a workshop on 'Regional Security in the North: Emerging Themes and Challenges' in [[Whitehorse, Yukon]], [[Canada]], in collaboration with [[Trent University]], [[Yukon College]], [[Royal Military College of Canada]], [[St. Jerome's University]], the Consulate General of the [[United States]] in [[Toronto]], Borders in Globalization and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/regional-security-north-emerging-themes-challenges/&lt;/ref&gt; At the workshop, David Johnny, former chief of the [[White River First Nation]], highlighted the challenges posed by borders to indigenous communities, such as the [[Upper Tanana]] peoples, whose villages and dwellings were near the boundary or even straddled the line.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yukon-news.com/news/white-river-first-nation-cut-off-from-relatives-by-alaska-yukon-border/&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Dr Dalee Sambo Dorough, professor at [[University of Alaska Anchorage]] and former chair of the [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]], discussed the difficulties faced by American and Canadian [[Inuit]].

Two months later, in August 2017, PRPI, along with [[University College London]] (UCL), [[Trent University]] and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] of [[Canada]], convened a follow-up interdisciplinary panel discussion on 'Arctic Borders Governance' at [[University College London|UCL]] in [[London]], with Prof. Heather Nicol, Dr Ilan Kelman and Dr Dwayne Menezes as speakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/arctic-borders-governance/&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion focused on the implications of borders on [[indigenous peoples]] in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions - particularly the [[Inuit]] in [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Greenland]] and [[Russia]]; the [[Aleuts]] in [[Russia]] and the [[United States]]; the [[Gwich'in]] people in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]; and the [[Sami people]] in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and [[Russia]]. These discussions also formed the basis of the paper on 'Canada, Indigenous Peoples and Northern Borders' that Menezes published in [[The Round Table: The Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs]] in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00358533.2017.1377905?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=ctrt20&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, on behalf of PRPI and [[Trent University]], Menezes and Nicol chaired a panel discussion on [[Arctic]] borders at the [[European Union]]- and [[Canada]]-funded Borders in Globalization 2nd International Conference held at the [[Lord Elgin Hotel]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], [[Canada]], with Canadian [[Senator]] [[Charlie Watt]], historian [[P. Whitney Lackenbauer]], lawyer Robin Campbell and [[Université de Montréal]] professor Suzanne Lalonde as speakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://biglobalization.org/sites/default/files/content-attachments/big_international_conference_2017_-_preliminary_program_5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dialogues on Arctic Transportation ====

In June 2016, PRPI Fellow and [[University College London|UCL]] Researcher Domagoj Baresic presented his research at the International Conference on 'Maritime Actors and Climate Change: Incentives and Strategies for Voluntary Action' organised by the Transatlantic Maritime Emissions Research Network (TRAMEREN), a joint research venture between the Center for Enterprise Liability, Faculty of Law, [[University of Copenhagen]] and the Frank Guarini Center, School of Law, [[New York University]], held in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/conference-trans…network-trameren/&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging the challenges involved with developing a comprehensive international legal framework for controlling maritime greenhouse gas emissions, the conference examined some of the innovative, yet decentralised, approaches for incentivising maritime emissions controls, paying attention to the fragmented legal architecture governing the sector.

Following the adoption and implementation of a prohibition on the use and carriage of [[heavy fuel oil]] (HFO) by ships operating in the Antarctic, the Clean Arctic Alliance (CAA) has campaigned to establish similar environmental protection measures in the Arctic. In November 2017, PRPI joined forces with CAA in its efforts to introduce a HFO ban in the Arctic and co-hosted a panel discussion on 'Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) Use in Arctic Shipping: Risks, Alternatives and Legal Options for a Phase-Out' at the 10th Polar Law Symposium in [[Rovaniemi, Finland]], with support from the [[European Climate Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/hfo-arctic-shipping/&lt;/ref&gt; At the event, PRPI became a signatory to the Arctic Commitment. In January 2018, PRPI also published a report by Dr Sian Prior of CAA and Liana James of the Clean Air Task Force about the progress made at the [[International Maritime Organization]] on a phase-out of the use of HFO as marine fuel in the Arctic, wherein they also laid out some of the measures which could be implemented to mitigate the risks associated with HFO use and the legal options available to ban HFO use in the Arctic altogether.&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/hfo-arctic/&lt;/ref&gt; Baresic also discussed his ongoing research on 'Sustainability Transitions in Arctic Maritime Transport' at the Arctic Circle Assembly in [[Reykjavik]] in October 2017 and the Arctic Circle Forum in [[Edinburgh]] in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticcircle.org/Media/060917-2017-arctic-circle-assembly-program.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticcircle.org/Media/2017-arctic-circle-scotland-forum-program.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside fuel use in Arctic shipping, the development of support infrastructure for safe, secure, effective and efficient Arctic transport has also been a research and policy priority for PRPI. In July 2017, PRPI organised a keynote lecture by PRPI Fisheries Head and [[University of Southern Denmark]] Professor Dr Brooks Kaiser on 'Arctic Ports: Local Community Development Issues' at [[Korea Polar Research Institute]] [[KOPRI]] in [[Incheon]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/arctic-fisheries…ts-seminar-korea/&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, Baresic and Menezes also presented about Arctic maritime and coastal infrastructure at the 11th Arctic Shipping Summit in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marsecreview.com/2017/08/11th-arctic-shipping-summit/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wplgroup.com/aci/event/arctic-shipping-summit-europe-2017/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilandgasdrill.com/event/11th-arctic-shipping-summit/&lt;/ref&gt; A number of subsequent PRPI 'SDGs in the Arctic' dialogues, such as those in Seattle and Tórshavn, also focused on Arctic transportation, with high-level speakers drawn from the [[Arctic Council]], [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)]], [[Alaska Airlines]], [[Maine Port Authority]], [[Maine Department of Transportation]], [[United States Department of Transportation]], [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] [[Homeland Security Centers of Excellence]] and the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Folketing]].&lt;ref name="jsis.washington.edu"/&gt; PRPI has also provided analysis and commentary on Arctic shipping to publications in the maritime domain.&lt;ref&gt;http://seanews.co.uk/arctic-shipping-an-overview-by-dr-dwayne-ryan-menezes-director-polar-research-policy-initiative/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dialogues on Arctic Sealing ====

In October 2017, PRPI and the Embassy of Canada in Iceland hosted a screening of the 2016 [[Canadian]] feature-length documentary film [[Angry Inuk]] at the 2017 Arctic Circle Assembly in [[Reykjavik, Iceland]], followed by a Q&amp;A session with the Inuk filmmaker [[Alethea Arnaquq-Baril]]. [[Canada]]'s [[Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs]] [[Carolyn Bennett]], [[Canadian]] Ambassador to Iceland Dr Anne-Tamara Lorre and PRPI Director Dr Dwayne Menezes offered addresses, while Penny Goodman of [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] moderated the discussion with Arnaquq-Baril.&lt;ref&gt;http://polarconnection.org/event/angry-inuk/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticcircle.org/assemblies/2015/breakout-sessions/session/angry-inuk-film-screening-and-qa-with-director-alethea-arnaquq-baril&lt;/ref&gt; The film presented a defence of the [[Inuit seal hunt]] in the face of the [[EU Ban on Seal Products]]. The film also set the stage for a panel discussion on 'Arctic Sealing: Threat or Blue Prospect?' convened the next day by the [[North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission]] (NAMMCO), [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) and [[Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated]] in which Arnaquq-Baril and Menezes both sat on the panel. The panel also included NAMMCO General Secretary Genevieve Desportes, [[Makivik Corporation]] Vice-President Adamie Alaku, [[Aaja Chemnitz Larsen]] and [[Nordic Council]] senior adviser Geir Oddsson, among others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcticcircle.org/assemblies/2015/breakout-sessions/session/arctic-sealing-threat-or-blue-prospect&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://nammco.no/topics/events/arctic-sealing-threat-or-blue-prospect/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://nammco.no/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/short-report-ac-bos-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://nammco.no/topics/november-24-2017-report-from-arctic-sealing-threat-or-blue-prospect/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/opinion/which-is-more-blue-arctic-sealing-or-the-eu-seal-ban/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RTR-Planeta''' is the international service of [[VGTRK]], a state-owned broadcaster in Russia.  It is available throughout the world via cable and satellite. In fact, RTR Planeta is the only provider of Russian-language programming to the Asia-Pacific region covered by the [[AsiaSat 2]] Satellite. To step up the accessibility of its content to viewers RTR Planeta has eagerly embraced new technologies launching in various [[IPTV]], [[ADSL]] and other advanced networks.

In October 2009 a separate version of the TV channel to broadcast via the [[Eutelsat 36A]] satellite to [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] TV viewers was especially created. This was done because on November 1, 2008 the Ukrainian Television and Radio Broadcasting Council demanded that (Ukrainian) cable operators remove [[Russian TV channels]] that did not adopt the Ukrainian legislation from their broadcasting lists. The decision affected, in particular, RTR-Planeta, [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]] and [[TV Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/50592 TV channel RTR-Planeta proposes special version for Ukraine], [[Kyiv Post]] (October 13, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, at that time, It was constructed by Alcatel Space is based on the Spacebus-3000B2 satellite bus. It was launched on the maiden flight of the Atlas III carrier rocket, which used the Atlas IIIA configuration. The launch was contracted by International Launch Services, and occurred on 24 May 2000, at 23:10 UTC from Space Launch Complex 36B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

On May 1, 2010, RTR Planeta returned to the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] cable networks.

==Lithuanian ban==
In April 2015 RTR Planeta's broadcasts were blocked for three months by [[Lithuania]] because of transmitting ‘propagation of violence and instigation of war’. Lithuania's Radio and Television Commission gave the explanation that RTR Planeta is portraying Ukrainian people as enemies of Russia and showing contempt for Ukraine’s territorial integrity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.delfi.lt/lithuania/society/lithuania-creates-precedent-in-eu-by-banning-russian-tv-station.d?id=67666870 ‘Lithuania creates precedent in EU by banning Russian TV station’], Delfi, April 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spinola Redoubt''' ({{lang-mt|Ridott ta' Spinola}}), also known as '''Birżebbuġa Redoubt''' ({{lang-mt|Ridott ta' Birżebbuġa}}), was a ''[[Redoubt|tour-reduit]]'' in [[Birżebbuġa]], [[Malta]]. It was built by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] in 1715–1716 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zammit|first1=Vincent|title=The Order's 18th Century Fortifications|journal=Civilization|date=1984|volume=1|page=170|publisher=PEG Ltd|location=[[Ħamrun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demolished.

==History==
Spinola Redoubt built in 1715–1716 part of a chain of fortifications that defended Marsaxlokk Bay, which also included three other redoubts, the large [[Fort San Lucian|Saint Lucian Tower]], two smaller [[De Redin towers]], seven batteries and three entrenchments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vendôme Tower|url=http://www.eh4-marenostrum.net/virtualtour/Marsaxlokk/trail_2/09/Vendome-Tower.pdf|website=Mare Nostrum|accessdate=28 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531015138/http://www.eh4-marenostrum.net/virtualtour/Marsaxlokk/trail_2/09/Vendome-Tower.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest fortifications to Spinola Redoubt were [[Pinto Battery]] to the northeast and Birżebbuġa Entrenchments to the south.

Spinola Redoubt was one of four ''tour-reduits'' built in Malta, with the other three being [[Fresnoy Redoubt]], [[Vendôme Tower]] and [[Marsalforn Tower#Second tower|Marsalforn Tower]]. It had a square shape, similar to the surviving Vendôme Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=18th Century Hospitaller Coastal Batteries|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/18th-century-hospitaller-coastal-batteries.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redoubt has been demolished and its site is now a public garden.

[[Antarctica]] sits on every [[Meridian (geography)|line of longitude]], due to the [[South Pole]] being situated near the middle of the continent. Theoretically Antarctica would be located in all time zones; however, areas south of the [[Antarctic Circle]] experience extreme day-night cycles near the times of the June and December [[solstice]]s, making it difficult to determine which time zone would be appropriate. For practical purposes time zones are usually based on [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|territorial claims]]; however, many stations use the time of the country they are owned by or the time zone of their supply base (e.g. [[McMurdo Station]] and [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] use [[Time in New Zealand|New Zealand time]] due to their main supply base being [[Christchurch]], New Zealand).&lt;ref name=DST&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timegenie.com/country.time/aq |title=Local Time → Antarctica @ Time Genie |publisher=Timegenie.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby stations can have different time zones, due to their belonging to different countries. Many areas have no time zone since nothing is decided and there are not even any temporary settlements that have any clocks. They are simply labeled with [[UTC|UTC time]].&lt;ref name=NZTime&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=468 |title=Current local time in Antarctica – South Pole |publisher=Timeanddate.com |date=2013-04-07 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Daylight saving time==
For the most part, [[daylight saving time]] (DST) is not observed in Antarctica because 95 percent of the continent is located south of the [[Antarctic Circle]] and the [[midnight sun]] phenomenon renders the use of DST unnecessary, and it would further complicate communication with the claimant countries in the northern hemisphere.

However, a few regions such as the [[Ross Dependency]] and, formerly, [[Palmer Land]], observe the time and use of DST of the countries they are supplied from, [[Time in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Time in Chile|Chile]], respectively.&lt;ref name="DST"/&gt; The areas have DST during the southern summer, when there is the northern winter, including January.
