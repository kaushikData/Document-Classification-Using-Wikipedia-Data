The '''2013 [[Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters]]''' was a men's [[tennis]] tournament for male professional players, played from 13 April through 22 April 2013, on [[Clay court|outdoor clay courts]]. It was the 107th edition of the annual [[Monte Carlo Masters]] tournament, which was sponsored by [[Rolex]] for the fifth time. It took place at the [[Monte Carlo Country Club]] in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]], France, near [[Monte Carlo]], [[Monaco]].

[[Rafael Nadal]] was the eight-time defending champion, but suffered his first defeat at the tournament since his debut in [[2003 Monte Carlo Masters|2003]] (he missed the tournament in 2004 due to injury), by losing in the final to [[Novak Djokovic]]. The defeat ended a [[Rafael Nadal's 46-match winning streak at the Monte-Carlo Masters|46-match winning streak]] dating back to the first of his eight consecutive titles at the tournament, in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-22/djokovic-dethrones-nadal-in-monte-carlo/4642428?section=sport Djokovic dethrones Nadal in Monte Carlo - ABC Grandstand Sport - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Points and prize money==
===Points distribution===
Because the Monte Carlo Masters is the non-mandatory [[Masters 1000]] event, special rules regarding points distribution are in place. The Monte Carlo Masters counts as one of a player's 500 level tournaments, while distributing Masters 1000 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx#requirements Ranking points]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad''' ({{lang-ar|أبو بكر بن محمد}}) (reigned 1525–1526) was a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Sultan]] of the [[Adal Sultanate|Sultanate of Adal]]. The historian [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]] credits Abu Bakr with founding the city of [[Harar]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pankhurst, ''History of Ethiopian Towns'' (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; which he made his military headquarters in 1520.

==Reign==
Abu Bakr organized Somali troops, then attacked Sultan [[Garad Abun ibn Adash]] of Adal and killed him, making himself sultan. However, his control over Adal was disputed by [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]], who eventually defeated Abu Bakr and killed him. The Imam then made his own brother, [[Umar Din]], the new Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;J. Spencer Trimingham, ''Islam in Ethiopia'' (Oxford: Geoffrey Cumberlege for the University Press, 1952), pp. 85f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AfCFTA was signed in [[Kigali, Rwanda]] on 21 March 2018. Signing the Agreement does not yet establish the [[African Continental Free Trade Area]]. It will function as an umbrella to which protocols and annexes will be added. Once all documents are concluded and ratified by 22 states, the free trade area will formally exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tralac.org/discussions/article/12869-how-will-the-afcfta-be-established-and-its-legal-instruments-be-implemented.html|title=How will the AfCFTA be established and its Legal Instruments be implemented?|last=Erasmus|first=Gerhard|date=22 March 2018|work=tralac Discussion|access-date=2018-03-28|publisher=trade law center|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations will continue in 2018 with Phase II, including Competition Policy, Investment and Intellectual Property Rights. A draft shall be submitted for the January 2020 AU Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://au.int/sites/default/files/decisions/34055-ext_assembly_dec_1x_e26_march.pdf|title=Decision on the draft agreement establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)|date=21 March 2018|website=au.int|publisher=African Union|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Asia Society''' is a [[non-profit organization]] that focuses on educating the world about [[Asia]].  It has several centers in the United States (Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, DC, and New York) and around the world (Hong Kong, Manila, Mumbai, Seoul, Shanghai, Sydney, and Zurich). These centers are overseen by the Society’s headquarters in [[New York City|New York]], which includes a museum that exhibits the [[John D. Rockefeller III|Rockefeller]] collection of Asian art and rotating exhibits with pieces from many Asian countries including China, Japan, India, Iran, and Korea.

On June 10, 2013&lt;ref name=SheeranAsiaSociety&gt;{{cite web|title=Asia Society Names Josette Sheeran New President|url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/asia-society-names-josette-sheeran-new-president|publisher=Asia Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josette Sheeran]], former Executive Director of the United Nations [[World Food Programme]] and Vice Chair of the [[World Economic Forum]], became the seventh president and CEO of the institution. On October 21, 2014&lt;ref name=RuddAsiaSociety&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Leader of Australia to Study Asia in a New Way|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/world/asia/kevin-rudd-new-head-of-asia-society-policy-institute.html|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Rudd]], former Prime Minister of Australia, was named president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, the organization's think tank.

==Mission==
[[File:Asia Society.svg|thumb|left|140px|Asia Society logo.]]
The Asia Society defines the region of Asia as the area from Japan to Iran, from central Asia to Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.  The Asia Society is a non-profit, non-partisan organization whose aim is to build awareness about Asian [[politics]], business, education, arts, and culture through education. The organization sponsors the exhibitions of art, performance, film, lectures, and programs for students and teachers. The programs are aimed at increasing knowledge of society with a focus on human rights, environment, global health and the position of women.

The Asia Society's original focus was explaining aspects about Asia to Americans, and Robin Pogrebin of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that it was "[l]ong regarded as a New York institution with regional branches".&lt;ref name="Pogrebinmobile1"&gt;Pogrebin, Robin. "[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/arts/asia-society-expands-in-houston-and-hong-kong.xml Asia Society Expands, in Houston and Hong Kong]". ''[[The New York Times]]''. February 2, 2012.&lt;!--Its publish date is Feb 2--&gt; Retrieved on January 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2011 the society was refocusing efforts on augmenting partnerships amongst Asians and between Asians and Americans in business, culture, education, and public policy. In 2011 Pogrebin said "over the last few years has aimed to recast itself as an international organization, partly through the construction of the two major centers in cities where it previously had only offices".&lt;ref name="Pogrebinmobile1"/&gt;

==History==
The Asia Society was founded in 1956 by [[John D. Rockefeller III]]. Initially established to promote greater knowledge of Asia in the US, today the Society is a global institution—with offices throughout the US and Asia—that fulfills its educational mandate through a wide range of cross-disciplinary programming. As economies and cultures have become more interconnected, the Society's programs have expanded to address Asian American issues, the effects of globalization, and pressing concerns in Asia including human rights, the status of women, and environmental and global health issues such as HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/about/mission-history |title=Mission &amp; History &amp;#124; About |publisher=Asia Society |date= |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==

===Headquarters===
The Society's Manhattan headquarters, at [[Park Avenue]] and East 70th Street on the [[Upper East Side]], is a nine-story building faced in smooth red [[Oklahoma]] granite designed by [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]] in 1980. Since it replaced some old [[brownstone]]s on one of the city's most prestigious streets, Barnes gave the building a strong [[facade]] to continue the line along Park, and set it back from East 70th with a terraced garden buffering it between the street and the older houses on that block. The semicircular window on the upper story and variations in the color and finish of the granite are intended to evoke Asian cultures. [[Paul Goldberger]], architecture critic at ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it "an ambitious building, full of civilized intentions, some of which succeed and others that do not". In the former category he put the interiors and the overall shape; in the latter he included the [[facade]].&lt;ref name="Goldberger review of building"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Goldberger|title=Architecture: Asia Society Building, A Design Full of Civilized Intentions |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/11/arts/architecture-asia-society-building-a-design-full-of-civilized.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 11, 1981|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, it was closed for 18 months so that new interiors, designed by [[Bartholomew Voorsanger]], could be built. During that time the society used the former [[Christie's]] Manhattan offices on [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]] as a temporary home. The completed renovation included a {{convert|24|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] and cafe. The expansion doubled the museum's exhibition space, allowing the society to put the entire Rockefeller Asian art collection on display.&lt;ref name="2000s expansion"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=Inside Art: Asia in Midtown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/10/arts/inside-art.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 10, 1999|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robin Pogrebin of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said in 2011 that the Asia Society is "perhaps best known for the elegance of its headquarters and galleries on Park Avenue at 70th Street".&lt;ref name="Pogrebinmobile1"/&gt;

===Global centers===
[[File:AsiaSocietyHouston.JPG|thumb|Asia Society Texas Center in [[Houston]]]]
Along with its New York headquarters, the Asia Society has centers throughout the United States and Asia. 2012 marked a major expansion, with the opening of multimillion-dollar buildings in Hong Kong and Houston, Texas.&lt;ref name="2012 expansion"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|authorlink=Robin Pogrebin|title=Asia Society Expands, East and West|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/arts/asia-society-expands-in-houston-and-hong-kong.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 31, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hong Kong complex, dedicated on February 9, 2012, is situated on the site of a former British military explosives magazine overlooking [[Victoria Harbour]] and includes numerous restored military buildings. The project was designed by architects [[Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects|Tod Williams and Billie Tsien]]. The Houston building, located in the [[Houston Museum District|city's museum district]], opened on May 6, 2012 and was designed by architect [[Yoshio Taniguchi]]. The other American centers are located in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.  Other Asian centers are in Seoul, Manila, Shanghai and Mumbai. There is also a center located in Sydney, Australia.

=== Museum ===
At its 70th Street headquarters, The Asia Society Museum is host to both traditional and contemporary exhibitions, film screenings, literature, performing, and visual arts. The holdings include works from more than thirty Asian-Pacific countries including Hindu and Buddhist statuary, temple carvings, [[Chinese ceramics]] and paintings, Japanese art, and contemporary art. The museum's collection of traditional objects stems from a donation from Asia Society founder John D. Rockefeller III and Blanchette Ferry Hooker Rockefeller, who contributed a number of items in 1978. The society began actively collecting contemporary Asian art with a 2007 initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/arts/design/05asia.html|title=Asia Society Will Build a Contemporary Art Collection|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|date=2007-09-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major renovation was completed in 2001, doubling the size of the four public galleries and expanding space for educational programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voorsanger.com/recent_projects/11#|title=Asia Society &amp; Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=Voorsanger Architects PC|publisher=|access-date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters also houses a museum shop and café. Forbes has listed the Garden Court Cafe on its All-Star Eateries in New York list several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/1222/019c.html|title=The Forbes 2008 All-Star Eateries in New York: Special|last=|first=|date=4 December 2008|work=|access-date=17 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

===Business===
The Asia Society annually presents a Corporate Conference in Asia, which functions as a fundraiser, to examine the implications of macroeconomic trends and geopolitical developments for the region and the world. Heads of Asian governments are often featured, as well as roundtable discussions with business and policy leaders from around the world.&lt;ref name="Corporate Conferences"&gt;[http://asiasociety.org/business-economics/corporate-conferences ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719091008/http://asiasociety.org/business-economics/corporate-conferences |date=July 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
The Asia Society's Education department has two primary objectives: one focusing on teaching and learning about Asia in the United States and the other on the expansion of US investments in international studies at the elementary and secondary school levels.&lt;ref name="2000s expansion"/&gt;

International education generally encompasses the knowledge of other world regions, cultures and [[global issue]]s; skills in communicating in languages other than English, working in global or cross-cultural environments and using information from different sources around the world; and values of respect and concern for other cultures and peoples.

====International Studies Schools Network====
The Asia Society International Studies Schools Network (ISSN) comprises a select group of public elementary and secondary schools across the country with programs in "developing globally competent, college-ready high school students".&lt;ref name="International Studies Schools Network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/education-learning/international-studies-schools-network |title=International Studies Schools Network |publisher=Asia Society |date= |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 35 schools in the network, covering both rural and urban communities and in cities throughout the U.S., from the Henry Street School for International Studies (New York, NY) and the Academy of International Studies (Charlotte, NC) to the Denver Center for International Studies (Denver, CO) to Vaughn International Studies Academy (San Fernando, CA) and the International Studies Learning Center (Los Angeles, CA).&lt;ref name="International Studies Schools Network - About our Work"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/education-learning/international-studies-schools-network/international-studies-schools-network |title=International Studies Schools Network &amp;#124; International Studies Schools Network |publisher=Asia Society |date= |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fellowships====
The Bernard Schwartz Fellows Program at Asia Society selects fellows to pursue research on business and policy issues with an emphasis on Asia-related areas of study.  Selected persons work in residence at the Asia Society headquarters in New York or in its Washington Center.

The Getty Fellowship is an Asia Society Museum program that provides cross-cultural work experience in the field of Asian art curatorship.

== Controversy ==

===Blocking pro-democracy activist from attending event===
Pro-democracy activist and secretary-general of [[Demosistō|Demosisto]] [[Joshua Wong (activist)|Joshua Wong]] was allegedly disallowed by Asia Society Hong Kong from speaking at a book launch originally scheduled to take place at its Hong Kong venue on 28 June 2017. It was understood that Asia Society Hong Kong was approached by PEN Hong Kong to co-curate the book launch, but negotiations stalled upon the former's request for a more diverse panel of speakers.  [[PEN Hong Kong]], a non-profit organization supporting literature and freedom of expression, eventually decided to relocate the launch of ''Hong Kong 20/20: Reflections on a Borrowed Place'' – of which Wong was one of the authors – to the [[Foreign Correspondents' Club, Hong Kong|Foreign Correspondents Club]]. Joshua Wong says that Asia Society Hong Kong needs to give a “reasonable explanation” for the incident.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/07/06/asia-society-faces-backlash-joshua-wong-demands-explanation-blocked-book-launch/|title=Asia Society faces backlash as Joshua Wong demands explanation over 'blocked' book launch|date=2017-07-06|website=Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“The mission of PEN Hong Kong is to promote literature and defend the freedom of expression. To bar one of the contributors to our anthology, whether it is Joshua Wong or somebody else, from speaking at our launch event would undermine and in fact contravene that mission,” said PEN Hong Kong President Jason Y. Ng.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Back to November 2016, Asia Society Hong Kong also canceled a scheduled screening of Raise The Umbrellas, a documentary on the 2014 Occupy protests with appearance of Joshua Wong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/world/asia/hong-kong-umbrella-revolution-film.html|title=Hong Kong Venue Cancels Screening of Protest Film, Citing Political Concerns|last=Tatlow|first=Didi Kirsten|date=2016-11-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asia Society Hong Kong has similarly cited the lack of balanced speaker representation at the pre-screening talk as the reason for not screening the film.

US Congressman [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]], co-chairperson of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, expressed that “The Asia Society has some explaining to do after two events that featured Joshua Wong prominently were canceled over the past nine months,” said the New Jersey representative. “I commend PEN Hong Kong for not appeasing the Asia Society’s demands.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PENHongKong/photos/a.1129327497162234.1073741828.1129137233847927/1456482501113397/?type=3&amp;theater|title=PEN Hong Kong|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2017, Asia Society Hong Kong released a statement on PEN Hong Kong's book launch event and acknowledged for their mistakes. “Asia Society takes this issue very seriously, and after looking into the circumstances, it is clear that an error in judgment at the staff level was made involving the PEN Hong Kong event. Asia Society, throughout its history, has hosted events at all of its global locations with speakers representing all sides of major Asia-related issues.” Asia Society Hong Kong emphasized they received no representations from the Chinese government on this matter, and Joshua Wong and speakers from all sides of the issue are welcome at Asia Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/hong-kong/statement-pen-hong-kong-event#CRsAhwuS3Islo3B4.01|title=Statement on PEN Hong Kong Event|website=www.asiasociety.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an email to a member, Asia Society Hong Kong's Executive Director S. Alice Mong reasserted that as an independent non-government organization, it remains impartial and apolitical, and that is priority is to stay focused as an educational organization that presents balanced perspectives to promote critical understanding of topics that matter to Hong Kong, Asia and their respective roles in the global context.

On 10 July 2017, Forbes magazine ran an article revealing Hong Kong real estate magnate and Asia Society Co-chair Ronnie Chan (a US citizen) to be the political force behind the Joshua Wong incident. It alleged that wealthy Asians have been behind US think tanks and NGOs and effectively turning them into foreign policy tools of the People's Republic of China (Beijing). However, the link to the article went dead a day later. It has been rumored that Asia Society or Ronnie Chan could be taking legal action against Forbes for libel. The original Forbes article is still accessible, at a different site: http://www.intellasia.net/chinese-influence-at-the-asia-society-elitism-and-radicalisation-in-hk-607591 .

On 20 July 2017, Asia Society Chairman Ronnie Chan defended the Hong Kong center’s apolitical stance at an event in New York.  He reiterated the Hong Kong center’s deliberate stance to stay away from local politics and to cover business and policy, education, arts and culture as an institution.  “At Asia Society, we generate not heat but light,” he said.&lt;ref&gt;http://asiasociety.org/video/hong-kong-20-years-later-promises-made-promises-kept-promises-be-fulfilled-complete&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August 2017, Hong Kong international affairs commentator and newspaper columnist Simon Shen wrote in support of Asia Society Hong Kong’s apolitical stance and described it as a “firewall” between international relations and local politics.  He pointed to the increasingly blinkered outlook of the local political discourse and argued for the need served by Asia Society to bring a broader perspective for understanding the role of Hong Kong in a global context.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ir-basilica.com/國際關係與本土政治的防火牆：由亞洲協會談起/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Western Desert}}
The '''Baggush Box''' was a [[British Army]] [[Fortification|field fortification]] built in the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]] near [[Maaten Bagush|Maaten Baggush]], {{convert|35|mi|km}} east of [[Marsa Matruh|Mersa Matruh]] during the [[Western Desert Campaign]] of [[World War II]].

==Background==
The box was built by men of the [[Western Desert Force]] (Lieutenant-General [[Richard O'Connor]]) as a tented camp, with offices said to be bomb-proof dug under sand dunes, as a temporary billet for troops taking part in operations against the [[Italian invasion of Egypt]] in 1940 by the Italian [[Tenth Army (Italy)|10th Army]]. O'Connor opened his headquarters on 8{{nbsp}}June. An airfield was a short distance inland and served as the headquarters of the [[Desert Air Force]] (Air Commodore [[Raymond Collishaw]].{{sfn|Pitt|2001|pp=43–44}}

==Prelude==
On 28 June, [[Italo Balbo]], {{lang|it|Maresciallo dell'Aria}} ([[Marshal of the Air Force]]), [[Governor-General]] of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of {{lang|it|Africa Settentrionale Italiana}} ([[Italian North Africa]], ASI), flew a reconnaissance sortie over Sidi Barrani and Maaten Baggush. The aircraft was shot down by Italian anti-aircraft gunners and the occupants killed, while landing at Tobruk; Balbo was replaced by Marshal [[Rodolfo Graziani]].{{sfn|Pitt|2001|p=28}}

On 26 November, O'Connor held a meeting at the Baggush Box after the completion of "Training Exercise No. 1", a rehearsal for [[Operation Compass]], in which attacks on fortified positions had been practised, the troops not being told that the positions were replicas of the Italian camps at Nibeiwa and the Tummars. The officers with O'Connor reported that the method laid down in ''The Division in Attack'' was too slow and sacrificed surprise, leaving the attackers vulnerable to air attack. The Air Officer Commanding in Chief, Air Marshal [[Arthur Longmore]], was being pressured from London to send formations to Greece and to provide air cover for Operation Compass, he stripped the air defences of Egypt of two squadrons and a flight, which he placed at O'Connor's disposal.{{sfn|Pitt|2001|pp=89–90}}

Before the offensive began O'Connor vacated the Baggush Box for a forward headquarters and Lieutenant-General [[Henry Maitland Wilson, 1st Baron Wilson|Henry Maitland Wilson]] the [[General Officer Commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] the [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] took over the headquarters.{{sfn|Pitt|2001|p=96}}

The '''Estonian Grand Prix''' was a [[auto racing|motor race]]. Mostly held for motorcycles, three times it was held for cars in the period between the World Wars. The race was established on a road course held between the villages of [[Pirita]] and [[Kose]], near [[Tallinn]].

[[File:Alfonso XIII, de Kaulak.jpg|thumb|King Alfonso XIII in 1915]]
The '''European War Office''' ({{lang-es|Oficina de la Guerra Europea}} or ''Oficina Pro Cautivos'') was a humanitarian office created by [[King Alfonso XIII of Spain]] to help the victims of the [[First world war|First World War]] no matter which side they fought on or whether they were civilians or military. This office depended directly from the [[Private Secretary]] of the King and had its headquarters in the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]].

One of the most importants achieves that the King made was to get a compromise from both sides of the conflicts to stop sinking of more [[Hospital ship|hospital-ships]]. As a result, Spanish naval observers sailed in the hospital-ships of various countries to make sure that the ships were being used for that purpose, rather than for military expeditions.The king also cooperated in the creation of a special signal code for hospital-ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alfonso XIII and Spain’s Humanitarian Work|last=Gracia Rivas|first=Manuel|publisher=Revista Española de Defensa|year=2014|isbn=|location=Madrid|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish neutrality==
{{Main|Spain during World War I}}
During the World War I, [[Spain]] remained neutral because of many reason, one of the most important for the King was his family ties (His wife was British and his mother Austrian, amongst other family relationships). But this fact did not prevent the King from getting involved in the war, creating the European War Office.

On August 7, 1914, it was published in [[Gazeta de Madrid|Madrid's Gazette]] a Royal Decree signed by both King Alfonso and [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] [[Eduardo Dato]] declaring the country neutral and saying that the government had the «duty to order the strictest neutrality to Spanish subjects in accordance with the laws in force and the principles of public international law».

For the [[Government of Spain|Government]], there was no reason to enter in the conflict and there was no enough resources to do so,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A century of Spain: politics and society|last=Juliá|first=Santos|publisher=Marcial Pons|year=1999|isbn=84-9537903-1|location=Madrid|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; something that the political and economic class was agreed with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Liberal Spain (1868-1917)|last=Suárez Cortina|first=Manuel|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=84-9756-415-4|location=Madrid|pages=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King also agreed despite of having commented with the French ambassador his wish of entering in the conflict in the [[Allies of World War I|allies side]] in exchange of a «some tangible satisfaction» —probably referring to [[Tangier]]—.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alfonso XIII. The controversial king.|last=Tusell|first=Javier|last2=García Queipo de Llano|first2=Genoveva|publisher=Taurus|year=2002|isbn=84-306-0449-9|location=Madrid|pages=284; 287-288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important reason for Spanish neutrality was the precariousness of its [[Spanish Armed Forces|armed forces]]. Spain was involved in numerous conflicts in the north of Africa because of its [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|protectorate of Morocco]]. This situation supposed an outdated [[Spanish Army|Army]], with bad supplies and because of the large number of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], most of the budget went to pay their salaries. The [[Spanish Navy|Navy]]'s reputation was very damaged because of the defeat in the [[Spanish-American War of 1898|American-Spanish War of 1898]] and it wasn't until a decade later when the government started again to invest in new warships, causing that the navy wasn't ready to enter into a war.

To all this we have to add the social unrest because of the growing of the labor movement and the appearance of left-wing republican parties that could cause a major conflict like happenned in the [[Russian Revolution]] if the conflict would be unfavorable to Spain.

==The Office==
[[File:1918-06-22, Heraldo de Madrid, Julián Juderías.jpg|thumb|Julián Juderías in 1918]]
The Office, with its headquarters in the Royal Palace, started around 1914 with just six staff. The publication in a french newspaper, Le Petit Girondais, a thank you letter provoked an avalanche of letters from many europeans asking for help. This forced the King to enlarge the office to 48 staff members, all of them speaking several languages and many volunteers. Among them was the historian and translator [[Julián Juderías]] whom spoke 15 languages.

The office worked in coordination with the [[Red Cross]] and was structurated in several sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/alfonso_xiii_king_of_spain|title=Alfonso XIII, King of Spain {{!}} International Encyclopedia of the First World War (WW1)|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Missing People.
*Information and Correspondence in Occupied Territories.
*Prisoners.
*Repatriations of Soldiers Severely Wounded or Sick.
*Repatriations of Civilians.
*Internment Service in Switzerland.
*Pardons.
*Commutations of Sentences.
*Remittance of Funds to Individuals and Families in Occupied Territories.
*Reports on Inspection Visits by Spanish Delegates.

The Office received more than 200,000 letters —140,000 of them from relatives of soldiers— all of whom were answered thanks to what Juan José Alonso Martín, director of the Palace General Archives, has described as «a primitive computing system.»&lt;ref name=ElPaís&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/11/08/inenglish/1541680126_698719.html|title=A king with a mission: the humanitarian deeds of Alfonso XIII during the Great War|last=Olaya|first=Vicente G.|date=2018-11-09|work=El País|access-date=2018-11-11|language=en|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of the King wasn't only to find people's relatives but to stop some executions. It's calculated that around a hundred people were saved from execution thanks to this office —including French and German soldiers—. The King even tried to save [[Tsar Nicholas II of Russia]] and his family with no success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/why-no-nation-would-rescue-nicholas-ii-and-his-family-from-revolutionary-russia/2018/08/02/bf5fcf0e-6a77-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html|title=Review {{!}} Why no nation would rescue Nicholas II and his family from revolutionary Russia|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elespanol.com/cultura/historia/20181109/espana-gran-guerra-mediador-alfonso-xiii-cataluna/351715887_0.html|title=España en la Gran Guerra: del mediador Alfonso XIII a las llamas en Cataluña|work=El Español|access-date=2018-11-11|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palace General Archives have more than 90 documents sent to [[St. Petersburg]] that proves the efforts to liberate or visit the Tsar —the office's staff visited more than 4,000 prisoners over all Europe— but the [[Romanovs]] were already dead by when the rescue operation started. Even this, the King was not sure of the fate of the [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina]] and her children so he and his office continued trying it.&lt;ref name=ElPaís/&gt;

There is also evidence that his efforts were instrumental in lifting the siege on [[Belgium]] so that food from the [[United States]] could reach its nine million inhabitants.

=== Recognition ===
The diplomats involved in the operation received the [[Medal of French Gratitude|Reconnaissance Française medal]], the women received the Red Cross medal and the rest of the staff received the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic|Order of Isabel the Catholic Queen]].

King Alfonso himself was thanked by the people of Belgium and [[Italy]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="ElPaís" /&gt; He was also greatly admired around the world. A young English girl even wrote this prayer which appeared in a newspaper: «''And God bless Father and Mother, and Nurse, and send Father back soon from his horrid prison in Germany. And God bless specially the dear King of Spain who found out about Father. Amen.»''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alfonso XIII and the War: The Mirror of Neutrals|last=Espinós Moltó|first=Víctor|publisher=|year=1918|isbn=8473350057|location=|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, King Alfonso was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], but it was given to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. He was nominated again in 1933, when he was already in exile. In honor of its royal visitor, Le Meurice Hotel has a room with his name, Suite Royale Alphonse XIII, where the very famous Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalí]] spent one month every year for thirty years.

* With only 8-years-old, a french girl named Sylviane Sartor sent a letter to the King asking him to find her uncle that was a war prisoner and saying that that would made her mother stop crying. She said the following: «''Your Majesty, Mother is crying all the time because her brother has been taken prisoner. She has just received a letter that says he will die of hunger. Your Majesty, if you could send him to Switzerland… because Mother is certainly going to make herself ill. Your Majesty, I thank you in advance. Your servant, Sylviane''». The King answered back that letter by asking for more information: «''Dear Miss, I will do my best to stop your mother from crying. So be so good as to send me exact news of your uncle so that I can take the matter further. Alfonso XIII, King.''» The prisioner was Achille Delmonte, found in a camp in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]] and sent back to [[Switzerland]] with his family.&lt;ref name=ElPaís/&gt;
*The French prime minister asked the King to try to get the repatriation of 20,000 French civilians that the war had surprised in the enemy zone, and that they had been deported to internment camps. Alfonso XIII achieved his liberation in a few months, and France considered him a war hero ever since.&lt;ref name=Alcelay&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alfonso XIII, el héroe de guerra olvidado|last=Alcelay|first=Carlos|publisher=mujerhoy.com|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The efforts of the office were unsuccessful in the search for John Kipling, the only son of the Nobel Prize for literature [[Rudyard Kipling]]. His remains were not found and identified until 1922.&lt;ref name=Alcelay/&gt;

==Public exhibition==
Nowadays, all these letters and documents from the European War Office are property of the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] archives and it forms part of a public exhibition called ''Letters to the King. The humanitarian activities of Alfonso XIII during the Great War'' that will be open between November 8, 2018 and March 3, 2019. It can be visited in the Genoa Rooms of the Royal Palace of Madrid.

'''''Explorer II''''' was a manned U.S. [[high-altitude balloon]] that was launched on November 11, 1935 and reached a record altitude of {{Convert|22,066|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}. Launched at 8:00 am from the [[Stratobowl]] in [[South Dakota]], the helium balloon carried a two-man crew consisting of [[United States Army Air Corps|U.&amp;nbsp;S. Army Air Corps]] Captains [[Albert W. Stevens]] and [[Orvil A. Anderson]] inside a sealed, spherical cabin. The crew landed safely near [[White Lake, South Dakota]] at 4:13 pm and both were acclaimed as national heroes. Scientific instruments carried on the gondola returned useful information about the [[stratosphere]]. The mission was funded by the membership of the [[National Geographic Society]].

==Background==
In January 1934, the [[National Geographic Society]] (NGS) and the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.&amp;nbsp;S. Army Air Corps]] decided to collaborate on a program to build and launch a manned balloon to the then record altitude of {{Convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. This vehicle would be capable of carrying a crew of three in an airtight capsule, along with a laboratory of instruments. The hydrogen balloon, named ''Explorer'', was completed by July at a cost of around $60,000; {{Inflation|US|60000|1934|fmt=eq}} currency.&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt;

The balloon was launched from a canyon in the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]]—dubbed the [[Stratobowl]]—on July 28, 1934 and reached a near-record altitude of {{Convert|60613|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}}&lt;ref name="Shayler2000"/&gt; before tears in the fabric led the crew to begin reducing their altitude. A rupture in the balloon resulted in a precipitous descent, followed by a spark that caused the hydrogen to ignite and destroy what was left of the balloon, leaving the capsule to plummet toward the ground at [[terminal velocity]]. The crew just managed to escape using their parachutes, with the last man bailing out at {{convert|500|ft}} above the ground. Their capsule was almost completely destroyed upon impact.&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt;

The crash resulted in a national embarrassment, leading Captain [[Albert W. Stevens]], the scientific observer on board the ''Explorer'' balloon, to lobby for another attempt with an improved balloon to be named ''Explorer II''. But news of the [[Osoaviakhim-1|fatal crash of a Russian stratospheric attempt]] in 1934 left President [[Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor|Gilbert H. Grosvenor]] of the NGS sobered by the risk.&lt;ref name="DeVorkin1991"/&gt; A review of the crash by the [[National Bureau of Standards]]&lt;ref name="DeVorkin1991"/&gt; (NBS) was held between July and September, revealing that the balloon had not opened symmetrically during the ascent, which caused stresses that led to the fabric tears. A month-long delay prior to launch had allowed the rubberized cotton to stick together, which created the uneven expansion. The hydrogen explosion followed when the gas in the bag mixed with the oxygen in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Shayler2000"/&gt;

==Preparation==
Despite the concerns, in 1935 the NGS and Army Air Corps decided to make another attempt. To eliminate the hazard of the hydrogen lifting gas, it was decided instead to use helium—to which the United States had a monopoly. The lower lifting efficiency of helium gas meant that a larger balloon would be needed,&lt;ref name="DeVorkin1991"/&gt; so [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear-Zeppelin]]&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt; increased the volume to {{Convert|3,700,000|cuft|m3|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. [[Dow Chemical Company]] assembled a larger, lighter gondola&lt;ref name="Maurer1987"/&gt; made of "Dowmetal"&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt;—a magnesium-aluminium alloy&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;— that would carry a two-man crew with a reduced amount of scientific instrumentation. The cabin was {{Convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in diameter with a mass of {{Convert|640|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=flip}} and could transport a {{Convert|1500|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=flip}} payload.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; It was manufactured from a single, large plate that was cut up into form that could be reshaped and welded into a sphere.&lt;ref name="Froes2006"/&gt; In order to make crew escape easier, the portholes were made wider than on the ''Explorer I''.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The atmosphere in the interior of the capsule was supplied from liquid air instead of liquid oxygen in order to reduce the fire hazard.&lt;ref name="Davis2008"/&gt; The modified balloon was ready by the spring of 1935 and the first launch occurred July 10, 1935. Unfortunately, this too proved a failure with the balloon rupturing at liftoff.&lt;ref name="DeVorkin1991"/&gt;

Following a review by the NBS, the balloon was prepared for another attempt after Goodyear strengthened the material. Examination of climatological data for the Stratobowl collected over the previous fifteen years was examined, and it was determined that the month of October typically had periods of good weather that would last sufficiently long for a flight attempt. A team of meteorologists was assembled at the Stratobowl in early September and they proceeded to put together a weather station. The meteorological requirements for the launch was for clear skies—with no precipitation—lasting for the duration of the flight, as well as surface wind speeds that were not to exceed {{Convert|14|mph|kph|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.&lt;ref name="Potter2010"/&gt;

With a [[cold front]] approaching, on the night of November 10, 1935 the balloon was prepared for launch. The temperature dropped to {{Convert|6|°F|°C|disp=flip}} overnight, so the {{Convert|115,845|sqft|m2|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of fabric was kept warm and pliable through the use of stoves. The task of inflating the balloon with helium from the 1,685 steel cylinders&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt; took eight hours,&lt;ref name="Potter2010"/&gt; during which the team needed to repair a {{Convert|17|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} long tear that formed in the fabric.&lt;ref name="Maurer1987"/&gt; Once inflated, the balloon stood {{Convert|316|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} tall.&lt;ref name="FWP2008"/&gt; The gondola was kept anchored to the earth by a team of more than 100 soldiers holding cables.&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt; Preparations were complete by 7:01&amp;nbsp;am the following morning&lt;ref name="Potter2010"/&gt; and the conditions were deemed suitable for a launch.&lt;ref name="DeVorkin1991"/&gt;

==Flight==
[[File:Historic weather balloon "Explorer II." Lake Andes NWR, South Dakota. - NARA - 283835.jpg|right|thumb|''Explorer II'' gondola at the landing site]]

The crew of the ''Explorer II'' consisted of Captain Albert W. Stevens, in command of the mission, and Captain [[Orvil A. Anderson]].&lt;ref name="Davis2008"/&gt; A crowd of around 20,000 viewers gathered to watch the event. (The local residents had raised and contributed $13,000 for the mission.&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt;) Lift-off occurred at precisely 8:00 am with the release of {{Convert|75|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of ballast made of fine lead shot. A few moments after liftoff, wind shear propelled the balloon into a side canyon, but thereafter it ascended normally.&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt;

The ''Explorer II'' reached a peak altitude of {{Convert|22,066|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}&lt;ref name="Bilstein2001"/&gt; at 12:30 pm and remained there for 80 minutes.&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt; This set a new world altitude record, and one that would last for nearly two decades.&lt;ref name="Bilstein2001"/&gt; The crew became the first humans to witness the [[curvature]] of the Earth. Unfortunately, the fan that was to be used to rotate the gondola proved ineffective at that altitude, so they were unable to avoid the Sun's glare. This made viewing from one side of the capsule nearly useless. Despite this, Captain Stevens reported seeing details of the Earth's surface for hundreds of miles. They were too high up to be able to view any movement on the ground,&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt; but their photography showed the potential of high-altitude reconnaissance.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

''Explorer II'' included communications equipment, and constant radio contact was maintained throughout the flight with the signal being broadcast across the U.S. and in Europe.&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt; The onboard instruments collected data on [[cosmic rays]], the ozone distribution and electrical conductivity of the atmosphere at different altitudes, the atmospheric composition of the stratosphere, and the luminosity of the Sun, Moon and Earth. In addition, microorganisms were collected from the stratosphere.&lt;ref name="Maurer1987"/&gt; Mold samples were carried along to determine the effects of cosmic ray exposure. Stevens took along a camera to take pictures, including the first ever motion pictures shot from the stratosphere.&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt; The collected data showed that the ozone in the upper atmosphere was effective at blocking most of the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. It was also found that the percentage of oxygen at the peak altitude was about the same as that at sea level.&lt;ref name="Davis2008"/&gt;

Finally, the descent was begun and it proceeded normally. At an altitude of {{Convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} the crew began releasing scientific instruments that would descend by their own parachutes. This was done to protect the data in case the gondola had a rough landing. The precautions proved unnecessary as the balloon landed gently in an open field near the town of [[White Lake, South Dakota]] at 4:13 pm.&lt;ref name="Ryan2003"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The success of the mission was much celebrated in the press and the aeronauts were invited to an audience with U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. They became national heroes and both men were presented with the [[Hubbard Medal]] of the National Geographic Society by General [[John J. Pershing]].&lt;ref name="NYT19351212"/&gt; The Air Corps awarded them the [[Mackay Trophy]] for the most meritorious flight of the year.&lt;ref name="Fredriksen2011"/&gt; Both men were also awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for each of the Explorer flights.

Scientific observations made during the mission were highly successful and much data was collected,&lt;ref name="DeVorkin1991"/&gt; with the results appearing in scientific journals.&lt;ref name="Weightman1937"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The data and the crew experiences were later used when designing flight crew equipment and methods for high-altitude combat operations during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Bilstein2001"/&gt; The balloon used for the ''Explorer II'' expedition was cut up into a million strips and distributed as commemorative bookmarks among the NGS members who supported the mission.&lt;ref name="Shayler2000"/&gt; The gondola is on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

The '''five hundred lei''' banknote is the highest of the circulating denomination of the [[Romanian leu]]. It is the same size as the [[Euro banknotes|200 Euro banknote]].

The main color of the banknote is gray. It pictures, on the obverse [[poet]] [[Mihai Eminescu]], and on the reverse the [[University of Iaşi]] Library, and the front page of the ''Timpul'' newspaper.

== History ==
In the past, the denomination was also in the coin form, as follows:

'''First leu (1867-1947)'''
* banknote issues: 1877 (the hypothecary issue), 1916 (re-issues: 1917, 1918, 1919, 1920), 1924 (re-issue: 1925, 1926, 1927, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1938), 1934, 1936 (re-issues: 1939, 1940), 1940 (re-issues: 1941, 1942, 1943)

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9236">Broadly, '''geoeconomics''' (sometimes '''geo-economics''') is the study of the spatial, temporal, and political aspects of [[economies]] and resources. The formation of geoeconomics as a branch of [[geopolitics]] is often attributed to [[Edward Luttwak]], an American economist and consultant, and [[Pascal Lorot]], a French economist and political scientist. Azerbaijani economist Vusal Gasimli defines geo-economics as the study of the interrelations of economics, geography and politics in the "infinite cone" rising from the center of the earth to outer space (including the economic analysis of planetary resources).

== "The logic of conflict in the grammar on commerce" ==
Luttwak argues that the same logic that underlies military conflict also pertains to international commerce:

* States seek to collect as much in revenue as their fiscal codes prescribe and are not content to let other states tax commercial activity in the former’s purview. This is a zero-sum situation. 
* States predominantly regulate economic activity to maximize outcomes within their own borders, rather than for a disinterested transnational purpose, even when the outcome is suboptimal for other states. The logic of state regulation then conforms, in part, to logic of conflict.
* States and blocs of states strive to restrict their payouts and services to their own residents. Moreover, states design their infrastructure projects to optimize domestic utility, regardless of how other states are affected, as opposed to the transnational utility.
* States or blocs of states promote technological innovation to maximize benefits within their own boundaries, rather than for the sake of innovation itself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luttwak|first=Edward N.|date=1990|title=From Geopolitics to Geo-Economics: Logic of Conflict, Grammar of Commerce|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/42894676|journal=The National Interest|issue=20|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geo-economics vs Mercantilism ==
Geo-economics is not to be confused with mercantilism or neo-mercantilism. Under mercantilism, the goal of which was to maximize national gold stocks, when commercial quarrels evolved into political quarrels, which could then lead to military conflicts. Therefore, mercantilist competition was subordinate to military competition, as the former modality was governed by the ever-present possibility that the ‘loser’ in a commercial quarrel could then challenge the outcome militarily. For example:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Spain might decree that all trade to and from its American colonies could only travel in Spanish bottoms through Spanish ports, but British and Dutch armed merchantmen could still convey profitable cargoes to disloyal colonists in defiance of Spanish sloops; and, with war declared, privateers could seize outright the even more profitable cargoes bound for Spain. Likewise, the Dutch sent their frigates into the Thames to reply to the mercantilist legislation of the British Parliament that prohibited their cabotage, just as much earlier the Portuguese had sunk Arab ships with which they could not compete in the India trade."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the new era of geo-economics, however, there is no superior modality: Both the causes and the instruments of conflict can be economic. When commercial disagreements do lead to international political clashes, the disputes must be resolved with the weapons of commerce.

== The "Weapons" of Geo-economics ==
States engage in geo-economic competition through both through assisting or directing domestic private entities, or through direct action opposing foreign commercial interests:

* States assist private entities through supporting high-risk research and development, initiating overseas market-penetrating investments, and through production over-investment for market-share forcing.
* More directly, states impose taxes and quotas on foreign products, bolster regulatory or covert impediments to imports, engage in discounted export financing, initiate national technology programs, and collect economic and technical intelligence.

According to Luttwak, offensive weapons are more important in geo-economics, as they are in war. Moreover, state-sponsored research and development is the most important of these weapons. &lt;blockquote&gt;"Just as in war the artillery conquers territory by fire, which the infantry can then occupy, the aim here is to conquer industries of the future by achieving technological superiority."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40767635|title=Turbo-capitalism : winners and losers in the global economy|last=Edward.|first=Luttwak,|date=1999|publisher=HarperCollinsPublishers|isbn=0060193301|edition= 1st U.S. |location=New York|oclc=40767635}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The “infantry” in this analogy corresponds to commercial production, which can also be supported by the state through various forms of subsidies.

Yet another geo-economic weapon is predatory finance. If operation subsidies are insufficient to allow domestic exporters to overcome strong competitors, states can offer loans at below-market interest rates. The United States’ Export-Import, for example, provides loan guarantees to finance exports, and equivalent institutions exist across all major industrial countries.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Thus foreigners routinely pay lower interest rates than local borrowers, whose taxes pay for the very concessions that foreigners receive. That already amounts to hunting for exports with low-interest ammunition, but the accusation of predatory finance is reserved for cases where interest rates are suddenly reduced in the course of a fought-over sale. Naturally, the chief trading states have promised to each other that they will do no such thing. Naturally, they frequently break that promise."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Geoeconomics superseding geopolitics? ==
At the end of the [[Cold War]], [[Richard Nixon]] predicted that geoeconomic considerations could eventually supersede classical [[geopolitics]] amongst US policy makers, a trend he viewed as problematic: “Still others contend that, as the cold war weaned, the importance of economic power and ‘geo-economics’ has surpassed military power and traditional geopolitics. America, they conclude, must beat its swords not into plowshares, but into microchips.” (Nixon 1992)."

== “The laws of geo-economic gravity” ==
[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council]] [[financial economist]] M. Nicolas J. Firzli has argued that “the laws of geo-economic gravity” including financial [[self-sufficiency]] and the existence of advanced, diversified [[transport|transportation infrastructure]] are essential to ensure the [[sovereign state|effective sovereignty]] of a state: "the government of Qatar is now paying an incommensurate price for having thought it could defy forever the laws of geo-economic gravity "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.academia.edu/33925293/The_Qatar_Crisis_and_the_Eastern_Flank_of_the_Arab_World |work=Al Sharq Al Awsat |location=Riyadh |title=The Qatar Crisis and the Eastern Flank of the MENA Area |first=M. Nicolas J. |last=Firzli |date=17 June 2017 |accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From that perspective, [[country attractiveness|investment attractiveness]] and the capacity to project [[soft power]] across considerable distance as China has done through its [[Belt and Road Initiative]] are also viewed as a key determinants of geo-economic strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3077974 |work=Revue Analyse Financière |location=Paris |title=G20 Nations Shifting the Trillions: Impact Investing, Green Infrastructure and Inclusive Growth |first=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5300">Life expectancy at birth in Malta was estimated to be 79 for men and 82 for women in 2013.  The infant mortality rate was 4.4 per thousand live births in 2015.  23.5% of the population were over 60 years old in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malta|url=http://www.who.int/countries/mlt/en/|accessdate=20 December 2015|publisher=World Health Organization|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
Although a Mediterranean diet is considered healthy, reducing the chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke by a third the Maltese diet, said to be influenced by the 200-year British rule and the proximity to Italy does not have the same beneficial effects. Biscuits, chocolates and sweets are more popular than nuts and fruit and in general the population follows a more Westernised diet than geography might indicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mediterranean diet is healthy... but Maltese isn’t|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130309/local/Mediterranean-diet-is-healthy-but-Maltese-isn-t.460787|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=Times of Malta|date=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diabetes==
In 2015 it was estimated that 10.69% of the population has diabetes, costing about $2,113 per person per year.  Diabetes prevention programmes in Malta get a lot of political backing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10: Which country has the highest rates of diabetes in Europe?

==Obesity==

In 2015 the [[World Health Organization]] reported that Malta had the highest overweight and obesity rates in the [[European Union]], and third in the whole of Europe, after Andorra and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malta has highest obesity rate in the EU|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150924/local/malta-has-highest-obesity-rate-in-the-eu.585550|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=Times of Malta|date=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 it was reported that 21.1% of women and 24.7% of  men were obese and 29.5% of Maltese children aged 11–15 were either overweight or obese.  It was suggested that this was a result of increased trade and urbanization, and an associated decrease in physical activity and increase in consumption of oil and sugar based foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Are The Maltese So Fat?|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/why-are-maltese-so-fat-213170|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=International Business Times|date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education Minister [[Evarist Bartolo]] established a programme of screening and testing school children to establish their body mass index in June 2015.  School tuck shops will not sell [[soft drink]]s, but only water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obesity: A holistic approach is needed|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-06-15/newspaper-leader/Obesity-A-holistic-approach-is-needed-6736137295|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=Malta Independent|date=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercise==
The [[Today Public Policy Institute]] described the population as "one of the fattest, laziest and most car-dependent nations on the planet" in December 2015.  Physical laziness was said to be legendary.  Their report condemned the government's approach to public health, and to encouraging activity in particular, saying that the  "living and transport environment has been systematically degraded to the extent that people are not inclined to opt for active mobility options but use their car as default transport, even for short journeys".  Malta is theleast physically active country in the world, with 71.9% of the population inactive. A very high proportion of children are inactive, watching three hours of television or more per night.  Less than 1% cycle regularly and the country is reckoned to be the worst and most dangerous country for cycling in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Maltese most obese, laziest and most car-dependent’|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20151216/local/maltese-most-obese-laziest-and-most-car-dependent.595862|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=Times of Malta|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smoking==
A ban on smoking in all enclosed public places came into force in January 2013.  An earlier law of 2004, the second in Europe, had restricted smoking to designated areas, ventilated and totally cut off from the rest of the establishment.  The EU anti-smoking campaign HELP: A Life Without Tobacco had found the earlier ban had beneficial effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Total ban on smoking in public places from 2013|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20100116/local/total-ban-on-smoking-in-public-places-from-2013.289974|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=Times of Malta|date=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government offers Tobacco Dependence Support Classes at clinics around the island and  a Quit Line and Free phone service for those who want to stop smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quitting Smoking|url=https://www.gov.mt/en/Life%20Events/Healthy%20Living/Pages/Quitting-Smoking.aspx|publisher=Government of Malta|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ekspress''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Экспресс'''}}, ''literally'' '''Express''') is a [[Communication satellite|communication]] and [[Satellite broadcasting|broadcasting]] system developed and operated by [[Russian Satellite Communications Company|RSCC]]. It is the largest network of [[Russia]] and its slots covers an arc in [[geostationary orbit]] from 14° West to 145° East. This allows it to cover the whole territory of Russia, the CIS, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific region, North and South America, and Australia. &lt;ref name=rscc-about /&gt;
The only other Russian civilian satellite operator is [[Gazprom Space Systems]] with its [[Yamal (satellite constellation)|Yamal]] constellation.&lt;ref name=gazkom-about /&gt;

==Ekspress Satellite Series==

While the Ekspress constellation started with a single model, during the years it has used many supplier and many models.&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-ekspressliste /&gt;&lt;ref name=rsw-ekspress /&gt;

The '''National Museum of Fine Arts''' ({{lang-sq|Galeria Kombëtare Arteve}}) is a national [[art museum]] in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]] under the supervision of the [[Ministry of Culture (Albania)|Ministry of Culture]]. This highly important art institution functions based on the 'Law of Museums' and the 'Law of Art and Culture' of the [[Albania]].

The beginnings of the institution can be traced back to the endeavors of a group of Albanian artists and the Arts Committee of 1946. Pinakoteka was the first institution of fine arts in the country. After much toil and extensive efforts, the Gallery of Arts officially opened to the public in [[Tirana]] on 11 January 1954. The Gallery worked in two main directions: exhibiting the permanent collection and opening temporary exhibitions of Albanian and foreign artists. The new visions on the development and display of fine arts, as well as the new acquisitions increased the number of artworks at the Gallery’s disposal and brought about the need for a larger and more functional new building.

The new venue opened on 29 November 1974. It was situated on the "Martyrs of the Nation" Boulevard and it is the existing building where the National Gallery of Arts stands today. This new opening is the moment of reorganization and of the first rebuilding programme which consisted in establishing an administrative structure made up of several departments dealing with artistic activities. The fund of the new gallery, up to this time, counted 340 artworks and its archives counted 240 registered artists. From this moment onwards the Gallery of Arts functions as the only and most important national institution of exhibiting, conserving, studying, restoring, publishing, documenting and archiving the works of art in Albania.

In 2009 and 2010, the National Gallery of Arts underwent important renovation works through a series of considerable private and public investments, which consisted in a qualitative reconstruction of interior spaces, aiming to preserve the original architectural project, as much as possible.
 
Part of the major reconstruction of the National Gallery it has also been  showing the permanent collection in May 2009, through a new visualizing concept, aiming to a better dissemination, education and information on cultural matters, for anever increasing Albanian and international public.

Today the National Gallery preserves/ conserves over 5000 artworks. Besides the permanent collection which is focused on Socialist Realism art, famous Albanian artists, international ones and  important collections have been part of the different exhibitions in the National Gallery of Arts. An important policy of the NGA activities are also the educational programs, where many children and students  participate.. 
Visitors of the National Gallery have  the opportunity to enjoy the activities and the exhibitions’ rich program, to know more about Albanian visual art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panorama.com.al/galeria-e-arteve-pavijone-te-mbyllura-dhe-mure-te-pa-lyer Galeria e Arteve, pavijone të mbyllura dhe mure të pa lyer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://artport.al/en/galeria-kombetare-e-arteve-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portugal''' ({{IPA-pt|puɾtuˈɣal|lang}}), officially the '''Portuguese Republic''' ({{lang-pt|República Portuguesa|links=no}} {{IPA-pt|ʁɛˈpuβlikɐ puɾtuˈɣezɐ|}}),&lt;ref group="note" name="A"&gt;In recognized minority [[languages of Portugal]]:
:*{{lang-mwl|República Pertuesa}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a country located mostly on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in [[Southern Europe|southwestern Europe]]. It is the westernmost [[sovereign state]] of [[mainland Europe]]. It is bordered to the west and south by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and to the north and east by [[Spain]]. Its territory also includes the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], both [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|autonomous regions]] with their own [[regional government]]s. 

Portugal is the oldest state on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in Europe, its territory having been continuously settled, invaded and fought over since [[Prehistoric Iberia|prehistoric times]]. The [[Pre-Celtic|Pre-Celts]], [[Celts]], [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] and [[Roman Republic|Romans]] were followed by the invasions of the [[Visigoths]] and [[Suebi]] [[Germanic peoples]]. 

Portugal as a country was established during the Christian ''[[Reconquista]]'' against the [[Moors]] who had invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 711 AD. Despite attempts at independence since its foundation as a county in 868,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Obras Completas de José Mattoso - Portugal Medieval: Novas intepretações; Vol. 8|last=Mattoso|first=José|publisher=Círculo de Leitores|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; only after the [[Battle of São Mamede|Battle of São Mamede in 1128]], where Portuguese forces led by [[Afonso Henriques]] defeated forces led by his mother, [[Theresa of Portugal]], the [[County of Portugal]] affirmed its sovereignty and Henriques styled himself Prince of Portugal. He would later be proclaimed [[King of Portugal]] at the [[Battle of Ourique|Battle of Ourique in 1139]] and was recognised as such, by neighbouring kingdoms, on the [[Treaty of Zamora]], in 1143.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Jenkins, Spyros A.

During this time Portugal monopolized the [[spice trade]], and the empire expanded with military campaigns in Asia. However, events such as the destruction of [[Lisbon]] in a [[Lisbon Earthquake|1755 earthquake]], the [[Industrial Revolution]], the [[Seven Years' War]], the country's occupation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the [[independence of Brazil]] (1822), erased to an extent Portugal's prior opulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/po.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[5 October 1910 revolution|1910 revolution]] deposed the monarchy, the democratic but unstable [[First Portuguese Republic|Portuguese First Republic]] was established, later being superseded by the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' right-wing authoritarian regime. Democracy was restored after the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974, ending the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. 

Shortly after, independence was granted to almost all [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|its overseas territories]]. The [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|handover of Macau to China]] in 1999 marked the end of what can be considered the [[Portuguese Empire|longest-lived colonial empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/1999/ASIANOW/east/macau/stories/macau.overview/|title=ASIANOW – Macau's handover to China ends Portuguese era – December 17, 1999|work=cnn.com|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word Portugal derives from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]-[[Celts|Celtic]] place name '''''[[Portus Cale]]'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/portugal|title=Portugal - Origin and meaning of the name portugal by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portus, the Latin word for [[port]] or harbour,  Cala or [[Cailleach]] was the name of a Celtic goddess - in [[Scotland]] she is known as [[Beira (mythology)|Beira]] - and also the name of an early settlement located at the mouth of the [[Douro River]] (present-day [[Vila Nova de Gaia]]) which flows into the Atlantic Ocean in the north of what is now Portugal. At the time the land of a specific people was frequently named after its deity. Those names are the origins of the -''gal'' in ''Portugal'' and ''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''. Incidentally, the meaning of ''Cale'' or ''Calle'' is also a derivation of the Celtic word for port which would confirm very old links to pre-Roman, Celtic languages which compare to today's Irish ''caladh'' or Scottish ''cala'', both meaning port. Some French scholars believe it may have come from 'Portus Gallus',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MD8zAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA441&amp;lpg=PA441&amp;dq=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ir3OkpgQcI&amp;sig=LzkcSY11hCzCrAgSrubkwJgy9jk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL2ZLCn_TYAhUYM8AKHXB8A3kQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal&amp;f=false|title=Manuel géographique et statistique de l'Espagne et du Portugal ...|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Buisson|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; the port of the Gauls or Celts. 

Around 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale and renamed it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of Cale'') incorporating it to the province of [[Gaelicia|Gaellicia]] with capital in [[Bracara Augusta]] (modern day [[Braga]], Portugal). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around ''Portus Cale'' became known by the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] as '''''Portucale'''''. The name ''Portucale'' evolved into '''''Portugale''''' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers [[Douro]] and [[Minho River|Minho]]. By the 11th and 12th centuries, ''Portugale'', ''Portugallia'' or ''Portvgalliae'' was already referred to as '''Portugal'''.

{{Main|History of Portugal}}

The early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] located in South Western Europe. [[The name of Portugal]] derives from the joined Romano-Celtic name [[Portus Cale]]. The region was [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|settled]] by Pre-[[Celts]] and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]], visited by [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Carthaginians]], incorporated in the [[Roman Republic]] dominions as [[Lusitania]] and part of [[Gallaecia]], after 45 BC until 298 AD.

The region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by [[Neanderthal]]s and then by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', who roamed the border-less region of the northern Iberian peninsula.&lt;ref name="Birmp1"&gt;David Birmingham (2003), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; These were subsistence societies that, although they did not establish prosperous settlements, did form organized societies. Neolithic Portugal experimented with domestication of herding animals, the raising of some cereal crops and fluvial or marine fishing.&lt;ref name=Birmp1/&gt;

It is believed by some scholars that early in the first millennium BC, several waves of [[Celts]] invaded Portugal from [[Central Europe]] and inter-married with the local populations, forming [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|different tribes]]. Modern archeology and research shows a Portuguese root to the Celts in Portugal and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Our Celtic roots lie in Spain and Portugal | url= http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/celtic-roots-lie-spain-portugal-2174486| accessdate=11 April 2017 | publisher = Walles Online | author= Devine, Darren}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that period and until the Roman invasions, the Castro culture (a variation of the [[Urnfield culture]] aka ''Urnenfelderkultur'') was prolific in Portugal and modern Galicia.&lt;ref&gt;Estos se establecieron en el norte de Portugal y el área de la [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] actual, introduciendo en esta región la cultura de las urnas, una variante de las Urnenfelder que evolucionaría después en la cultura de los castros o castreña&lt;/ref&gt;
This culture, together with the surviving elements of the Atlantic megalithic culture and the contributions that come from the more Western Mediterranean cultures, end up in what has been called the '''Cultura Castreja''' or [[Castro Culture]]. This denomination refers to the characteristic Celtic populations called 'dùn', 'dùin' or 'don' in [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] and that the Romans called castrae in their chronicles.

Based on the Roman chronicles about the [[Callaeci]] peoples, along with the [[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/leborgablare01macauoft|title=Lebor gabála Érenn: The book of the taking of Ireland|first=Robert Alexander Stewart|last=Macalister|publisher=Dublin : Published for the Irish texts Society by the Educational Company of Ireland|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; narrations and the interpretation of the abundant archaeological remains throughout the northern half of Portugal and Galicia; it is possible to infer that theirs was a matriarchal society, with a military and religious aristocracy probably of Feudal type. The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal), of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, main referring medical and religious that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the [[druids]] to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events. 
The first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as [[Strabo]], [[Herodotus]] or [[Pliny the Elder]], among others about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the [[Gallaecia|Gallaeci of Northern Portugal]] as:
"A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the moon."

Other similar tribes, and chief among them were the [[Lusitanians]], with the core area of these people lying in inland central Portugal, numerous other related tribes existed such as  the [[Celtici|Celtici of Alentejo]], and the [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve]]. Among the tribes or sub-divisions were the [[Bracari]], [[Coelerni]], [[Equaesi]], [[Grovii]], [[Interamici]], [[Leuni]], [[Luanqui]], [[Limici]], [[Narbasi]], [[Nemetati]], [[Paesuri]], [[Quaquerni]], [[Seurbi]], [[Tamagani]], [[Tapoli]], [[Turduli]], [[Turduli Veteres]], [[Turdulorum Oppida]], [[Turodi]], and [[Zoelae]]. A few small, semi-permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) were also founded in the [[Algarve]] region by [[Phoenicians]]–[[Carthaginians]].

=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===
{{Main|Lusitania|Gallaecia|Hispania}}
[[File:Evora-RomanTemple edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Temple of Évora]], in the [[Alentejo]], is one of the best preserved [[Roman civilization|Roman]]-built structures in the country]]
[[File:Torre de Centum Cellas.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.92|[[Centum Cellas]], in the [[Beira (Portugal)|Beira region]], is a Roman ''[[villa rustica]]'' from the [[1st century CE]].]]
Romans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's adversary in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During the last days of [[Julius Caesar]], almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the [[Roman Republic]].

The Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and
the lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The Lusitanians and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of western Iberia.

Rome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion, but to no avail – the Lusitanians kept conquering territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him. In 139 BC, Viriathus was assassinated, and Tautalus became leader.

Rome installed a colonial regime. The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the Visigothic era.

In 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as [[Gallaecia]], with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's [[Braga]].
There are still many ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) all over modern Portugal and remains of [[Castro culture]].
Numerous Roman sites are scattered around present-day Portugal, some urban remains are quite large, like [[Conímbriga]] and [[Miróbriga|Mirobriga]]. The former, beyond being one of the largest [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a [[Monuments of Portugal|National Monument]]. Conímbriga lies {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} from [[Coimbra]] which by its turn was the ancient ''[[Aeminium]]''). The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations.

Several works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circus, theatres and layman's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, some of which coined in Lusitanian land, as well as numerous pieces of ceramics were also found. Contemporary historians include [[Paulus Orosius]] (c. 375–418)&lt;ref&gt;David Rohrbacher, "Orosius," in ''The Historians of Late Antiquity'' (Routledge, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TLvK-_fk8TkC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=Orosius+life+OR+biography+OR+born+OR+birth&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U2atlXMBUN45DliVbnt_fLlckZInw pp. 135–137.] Rohrbacher bases the date of birth on Augustine's description of Orosius as a "young priest" and a "son by age" in the period 414–418, which would place his age at 30 or younger.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hydatius]] (c. 400–469), bishop of [[Aquae Flaviae]], who reported on the final years of the Roman rule and arrival of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]].

=== Germanic kingdoms: Suebi and Visigoths ===
[[File:Cvp-00791-109v.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]], [[Kingdom of the Suebi|King of the Suebi]], and St. [[Martin of Braga]]; c. 1145.]] 
In the early 5th century, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], namely the [[Suebi]] and the [[Vandals]] ([[Silingi]] and [[Hasdingi]]) together with their allies, the [[Sarmatian]]s and [[Alans]] invaded the [[Iberian Peninsula]] where they would form their kingdom. The [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] was the Germanic post-Roman kingdom, established in the former Roman provinces of [[Gallaecia]]-[[Lusitania]]. 5th-century vestiges of [[Alans|Alan]] settlements were found in [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]] (from old Germanic ''Alan kerk'', ''temple of the Alans''), [[Coimbra]] and Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;Milhazes, José. [http://www.rtp.pt/index.php?article=264957&amp;visual=16&amp;rss=0 Os antepassados caucasianos dos portugueses]&amp;nbsp;– [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal]] in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101100219/http://www.rtp.pt/index.php?article=264957&amp;visual=16&amp;rss=0 |date=1 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 410 and during the 6th century it became a formally declared [[Kingdom of the Suebi]], where king [[Hermeric]] made a peace treaty with the Gallaecians before passing his domains to [[Rechila]], his son. In 448 Réchila died, leaving the state in expansion to [[Rechiar]].
After the defeat against the Visigoths, the Suebian kingdom was divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457–459) reunified the kingdom to finish being assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy. 
Although the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings: 
[[Frumar]] (Frumario 459–463) and Remismundo (son of [[Maldras]]) (459–469) who would re-reunify his father's kingdom in 463 and that he would be forced to adopt [[Arianism]] in 465 due to the Visigoth influence.
By the year 500, the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] had been installed in Iberia, based in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule. 

After the death of [[Remismund]] (Remismundo) in 469 a dark period set in, where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted until 550. The only thing known about this period is that [[Theodemund]] (Teodemundo) most probably ruled the Suebians.
The dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico (550–559) who reinstalled [[Catholicism]] in 550. He was succeed by [[Theodemar]] or Theodemir (Teodomiro 559–570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held.
The councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian parish) and the [[Christianization]] of the pagan population (de correctione rusticorum) under the auspices of [[Saint Martin of Braga]] (São Martinho de Braga).
[[File:Reino suevo.svg|thumb|200px|left|Map of 5th- and 6th-century [[Kingdom of the Suebi]]]]
After the death of Teodomiro, [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] (570–583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of Braga (572) was held.
The Visigothic civil war began in 577. Miro intervened. Later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed operation the Miro died.

In the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place. [[Eborico]] (Eurico, 583–584) was dethroned by [[Andeca]] (Audeca 584–585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Leovigildo. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585, turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Gothic kingdom. 
[[Leovigild]] was crowned King of Gallaecia, Hispania and Gallia Narbonensis.

For the next 300 years and by the year 700, the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths. Under the Visigoths, Gallaecia was a well-defined space governed by a doge of its own. Doges at this time were related to the monarchy acted as princes in all matters. Both 'governors' [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] and [[Wittiza]] (Vitiza) acted as doge (and would end up being kings in Toledo).  These two became known as the 'vitizians', who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711. 

King [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia.
 
From the various Germanic groups who settled in Western Iberia, the [[Suebi]] left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and Asturias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fim do Império Romano e Chegada dos Suevos|url=http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|website=notapositiva.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suevos|url=http://www.infoescola.com/povos-germanicos/suevos/|website=infoescola.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vestígios da presença sueva no noroeste da península ibérica: na etnologia, na arqueologia e na língua|url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0807-89672013000200016|website=scielo.mec.pt|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal. 
Bracara (Augusta), the modern city of [[Braga]] and former capital of [[Gallaecia]], became the capital of the Suebi. [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], at that time resident in Hispania, shows a rather pacific initial settlement, the newcomers working their lands&lt;ref&gt;"the barbarians, detesting their swords, turn them into ploughs", ''Historiarum Adversum Paganos'', VII, 41, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; or serving as bodyguards of the locals.&lt;ref&gt;"anyone wanting to leave or to depart, uses these barbarians as mercenaries, servers or defenders",  ''Historiarum Adversum Paganos'', VII, 41, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another Germanic group that accompanied the Suebi and settled in Gallaecia were the [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]]. They settled in the region between the rivers ''[[Cávado River|Cávado]]'' and ''Homem'', in the area known as [[Terras de Bouro]] (Lands of the Buri).&lt;ref&gt;Domingos Maria da Silva, ''Os Búrios'', Terras de Bouro, Câmara Municipal de Terras de Bouro, 2006.

Today's modern day continental Portugal, along with most of modern Spain, was part of [[al-Andalus]] between 711–1249, following the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 711. This occupation lasted from some decades in the North to five centuries in the South.

After defeating the [[Visigoths]] in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 711, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], which stretched from the [[Indus]] river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of Córdoba]]. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.

The governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north. Most of Portugal fell into the hands of the [[Taifa of Badajoz]] of the [[Aftasid Dynasty]], and after a short spell of an ephemeral [[Taifa of Lisbon]] in 1022, fell under the dominion of the [[Taifa of Seville]] of the [[Abbadids]] poets. The Taifa period ended with the conquest of the [[Almoravids]] who came from [[Morocco]] in 1086 winning a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]], followed a century later in 1147, after the second period of Taifa, by the [[Almohads]], also from [[Marrakesh]].&lt;ref&gt;Portugal musalman (Le) – VIIIe-XIIIe siècles par Christophe Picard – Maisonneuve et Larose – Collection Occident Musulman – 2001, 500 p. {{ISBN|2706813989}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Al-Andaluz was divided into different districts called ''Kura''. Gharb Al-Andalus at its largest was constituted of ten kuras,&lt;ref name="A. R. Disney, p.55"&gt;A History of Portugal and the Portuguese Empire, Vol. 1: From Beginnings to 1807: Portugal (Volume 1) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; each with a distinct capital and governor. The main cities of the period in Portugal were [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]], [[Silves Municipality, Portugal|Silves]], [[Alcácer do Sal]], [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] and [[Lisbon]].
The Muslim population of the region consisted mainly of native Iberian converts to [[Islam]] (the so-called ''[[Muwallad]]'' or ''Muladi'') and berbers. The Arabs were principally noblemen from [[Syria]] and [[Oman]]; and though few in numbers, they constituted the elite of the population. The [[Berbers]] were originally from the [[Atlas mountains]] and [[Rif]] mountains of North Africa and were nomads.

=== County of Portucale ===

{{Main|County of Portugal}}
An Asturian Visigothic noble named [[Pelagius of Asturias]] in 718 was elected leader&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pelayo-king-of-Asturias|title=Pelayo – king of Asturias|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by many of the ousted [[Visigoth]] nobles. Pelagius called for the remnant of the Christian Visigothic armies to rebel against the Moors and regroup in the unconquered northern Asturian highlands, better known today as the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], in what is today the small mountain region in North-western [[Spain]], adjacent to the [[Bay of Biscay]].&lt;ref name="V. Livermore, 1969 pp. 32-33"&gt;H. V. Livermore, ''A New History of Portugal'' (Cambridge University Press: London, 1969) pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelagius' plan was to use the Cantabrian mountains as a place of refuge and protection from the invading Moors. He then aimed to regroup the Iberian Peninsula's Christian armies and use the Cantabrian mountains as a springboard from which to regain their lands. In the process, after defeating the Moors in the [[Battle of Covadonga]] in 722, Pelagius was proclaimed king, thus founding the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and starting the war of Christian reconquest known in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as the ''[[Reconquista|Reconquista Cristã]]''.&lt;ref name="V. Livermore, 1969 pp. 32-33"/&gt;

At the end of the 9th century, the region of Portugal, between the rivers Minho and Douro, was freed or reconquered from the Moors by [[Vímara Peres]] on the orders of King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]]. Finding that the region had previously had two major cities – [[Portus Cale]] in the coast and [[Braga]] in the interior, with many towns that were now deserted – he decided to repopulate and rebuild them with Portuguese and Galician refugees and other Christians.&lt;ref name="QuidNovi"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Ribeiro |first1=Ângelo |last2=Hermano |first2=José |title=História de Portugal I&amp;nbsp;– A Formação do Território |trans-title=History of Portugal: The Formation of the Territory |publisher=QuidNovi |year=2004 |isbn=989-554-106-6 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from the Arabs from the South, the coastal regions in the North were also attacked by [[Normans|Norman]] and [[Viking]] raiders mainly from 844. The last great invasion, through the [[Minho (river)]], ended with the defeat of [[Olaf II Haraldsson]] in 1014 against the Galician nobility who also stopped further advances into (the County of) Portugal. 

Vímara Peres organized the region he had reconquered, and elevated it to the status of [[County]], naming it the [[County of Portugal]] after the region's major port city – ''Portus Cale''' or modern [[Porto]]. One of the first cities Vimara Peres founded at this time is Vimaranes, known today as [[Guimarães]] – the "birthplace of the Portuguese nation" or the "cradle city" (Cidade Berço in Portuguese).&lt;ref name="QuidNovi"/&gt;

After annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] knighted Vímara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of Portus Cale (Portugal). The region became known as ''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', and simultaneously ''Portugália'' – the [[County of Portugal]].&lt;ref name="QuidNovi"/&gt; 
[[File:Henri de Bourgogne reçoit l'investiture du comté de Portugal, 1094 (Claude Jacquand, dit Claudius; 1841).png|thumb|left|[[Alfonso VI of León]] investing [[Henry, Count of Portugal]], in 1093]]
Later the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Iberia due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the king's offspring. With the forced abdication of [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III "the Great" of Asturias]] by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 under the crown of [[Kingdom of León|León]].

In 1093, [[Alfonso VI of León]] bestowed the county to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] and married him to his daughter, [[Teresa of León, Countess of Portugal|Teresa of León]], for his role in reconquering the land from Moors. Henry based his newly formed county in Bracara Augusta (modern [[Braga]]), capital city of the ancient Roman province, and also previous capital of several kingdoms over the first millennia.

===Afonsine era===
{{main|Portugal in the Middle Ages|Portuguese House of Burgundy}}
[[File:D. Afonso Henriques - The Portuguese Genealogy (Genealogia dos Reis de Portugal).png|thumb|upright=0.80|[[Afonso Henriques]] was the last [[Count of Portugal]] and the first [[list of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]] after winning the [[Battle of Ourique]] in 1139. (''Depicted in a 1530's [[illuminated manuscript]]'')]]
On 24 June 1128, the [[Battle of São Mamede]] occurred near [[Guimarães]]. [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]], Count of Portugal, defeated his mother [[Teresa, Countess of Portugal|Countess Teresa]] and her lover [[Fernão Peres de Trava]], thereby establishing himself as sole leader. Afonso then turned his arms against the Moors in the south.

Afonso's campaigns were successful and, on 25 July 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]], and straight after was unanimously proclaimed [[King of Portugal]] by his soldiers. This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal, as a fief of the Kingdom of León, was transformed into the independent [[Kingdom of Portugal]].

Afonso then established the first of the [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]], where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga, though the validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth created during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]]. Afonso was recognized in 1143 by King [[Alfonso VII of León]], and in 1179 by [[Pope Alexander III]].

During the [[Reconquista]] period, Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from [[Moors|Moorish]] domination. Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors. At this time, Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] and complete expulsion of the last Moorish settlements on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders, with minor exceptions.

In one of these situations of conflict with the [[kingdom of Castile]], [[Dinis I of Portugal]] signed with the king [[Fernando IV of Castile]] (which was represented, when being a minor, by his mother the queen [[Maria de Molina]]) the [[Treaty of Alcañices (1297)]], which stipulated that Portugal abolished agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant [[Juan de Castilla]]. This treaty established inter alia the border demarcation between the kingdom of Portugal and the kingdom of Leon, where the disputed town of [[Olivenza]] was included.

The reigns of [[Denis I of Portugal|Dinis I]] (Denis I), [[Afonso IV of Portugal|Afonso IV]] (Alphons IV), and [[Peter I of Portugal|Pedro I]] (Peter I) for the most part saw peace with the Christian kingdoms of Iberia.

In 1348 and 1349 Portugal, like the rest of Europe, was devastated by the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2007/09/13/2031252.htm?site=science/greatmomentsinscience Black Death], Great Moments in Science, ABC Science&lt;/ref&gt; In 1373, Portugal made an [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|alliance with England]], which is the longest-standing alliance in the world. Over time, this went far beyond geo-political and military cooperation (protecting both nations' interests in Africa, the Americas and Asia against French, Spanish and Dutch rivals) and maintained strong trade and cultural ties between the two old European allies. Particularly in the [[Oporto]] region, there is visible English influence to this day.

 }}
In 1383, [[John I of Castile]], husband of [[Beatrice of Portugal]] and son-in-law of [[Ferdinand I of Portugal]], claimed the throne of Portugal. A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by [[John I of Portugal|John of Aviz]] (later King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]] defeated the Castilians in the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]]. With this battle, the [[House of Aviz]] became the ruling house of Portugal.

Portugal spearheaded European exploration of the world and the [[Age of Discovery]]. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], son of [[John I of Portugal|King João I]], became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During this period, Portugal explored the [[Atlantic Ocean]], discovering several Atlantic archipelagos like the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], and [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], explored the African coast, colonized selected areas of Africa, discovered an eastern [[Portuguese India Armadas|route to India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[Colonial Brazil#Discovery and early exploitation|discovered Brazil]], explored the [[Indian Ocean]], established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia, and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to [[Jorge Álvares|China]] and [[Nanban trade|Japan]].

In 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering [[Ceuta]], the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], which led to the first [[colonialism|colonization]] movements.

Throughout the 15th century, [[European exploration of Africa#Portuguese|Portuguese explorers]] sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for [[Economic history of Portugal#Expansion of the Portuguese empire (15th and 16th centuries)|several common types of tradable commodities at the time]], ranging from [[gold]] to [[slavery|slaves]], as they looked for a route to India and its [[spice]]s, which were coveted in Europe.

The [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of [[Christopher Columbus]], was made by [[Pope Alexander VI]], the mediator between Portugal and Spain. It was signed on 7 June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (off the west coast of Africa).

In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] reached [[India]] and brought [[Economic history of Portugal|economic prosperity to Portugal]] and its population of 1.7&amp;nbsp;million residents, helping to start the [[Portuguese Renaissance]]. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] reached what is now [[Canada]] and founded the town of [[Portugal Cove-St. Philip's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], long before the French and English in the 17th century, and being just one of many [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese Colonizations of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/portuguese.html |title=The Portuguese Explorers: Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage |publisher=Heritage.nf.ca |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/corte_real_miguel_1E.html |title=Corte-Real, Miguel |first=L.-A. |last=Vigneras |volume=I |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcsp.ca/?Content=Visiting/About_Our_Town/History|title=Town of Portugal Cove – St.Philip's : History|work=pcsp.ca|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1500, [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] discovered [[Brazil]] and claimed it for Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;The standard view of historians is that Cabral was blown off course as he was navigating the currents of the South Atlantic, sighted the coast of South America, thereby accidentally discovering Brazil. However, for an alternative account of the discovery of Brazil, see [[History of Brazil]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Goa]] in India, [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] and [[Ormuz]] in the [[Persian Strait]], and [[Malacca]], now a [[States of Malaysia|state]] in Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the [[Indian Ocean]] and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe, landing in such places as Taiwan, Japan, the island of [[Timor]], and in the [[Moluccas]].

Although for a long period it was believed the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia, there is also some evidence that the [[Theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia|Portuguese may have discovered Australia]] in 1521.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Giles Tremlett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/22/uk.australia |title=Another nail in Cook's coffin as map suggests he was pipped by Portugal |publisher=The Guardian |date=22 March 2007 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/10575227/Kangaroo-in-400-year-old-manuscript-could-change-Australian-history.html |title=Kangaroo in 400-year-old manuscript could change Australian history |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=31 January 2014 |location=London |first=Bernd |last=Debusmann |date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perry |first=Michael |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/21/us-australia-map-idUSSYD3449720070321 |title=Map proves Portuguese discovered Australia: new book |publisher=Reuters |date=21 March 2007 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain, specified the anti-meridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.

All these factors made Portugal one of the world's major economic, military, and political powers from the 15th century until the late 16th century.

=== Iberian Union, Restoration and early Brigantine era ===
{{Main|Iberian Union|Portuguese Restoration War|House of Braganza}}
[[File:All_areas_of_the_world_that_were_once_part_of_the_Portuguese_Empire.png|thumb|left|300px|The areas across the world that were, at one point in their history, part of the [[Portuguese Empire]].]]
Portugal voluntarily entered a dynastic union between 1580 and 1640. This occurred because the last two kings of the [[House of Aviz]]&amp;nbsp;– King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]], who died in the [[battle of Alcácer Quibir]] in [[Morocco]], and his great-uncle and successor, King-[[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Henry I of Portugal|Henry of Portugal]]&amp;nbsp;– both died without heirs, resulting in the [[Portuguese succession crisis of 1580]].

Subsequently, [[Philip II of Spain]] claimed the throne and was accepted as Philip I of Portugal. Portugal did not lose its formal independence, briefly forming a [[Iberian Union|union]] of kingdoms. At this time Spain was a [[geographic region|geographic territory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/9858/1/1812Cadiz.pdf Peña, Lorenzo.

[...] there had never been a proclamation of a Kingdom of Spain, so that difficulties always arose upon the legal value of the very frequent references to 'Spain' in the legal texts of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Spanish sovereigns had always refused the advice [...] in the sense of establishing a United Kingdom of Spain, preferring to see themselves as vertices of converging scattered kingdoms, at least in theory. Even the Napoleonic Bayonne Constitution of 1808 did not proclaim a kingdom of Spain, but a 'Crown of Spain and the Indies'. On the other hand, 'Spain' was merely a geographical name, a simple romance version of 'Hispania', whereby its use, in principle, should not have to go beyond the designations ‘Galia’,‘ Germania’ [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of an independent foreign policy and led to its involvement in the [[Eighty Years' War]] between Spain and the [[Netherlands]].

War led to a deterioration of the relations with [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|Portugal's oldest ally, England]], and the loss of [[Ormus|Hormuz]], a strategic trading post located between [[Iran]] and [[Oman]]. From 1595 to 1663 the [[Dutch-Portuguese War]] primarily involved the Dutch companies invading many Portuguese [[colonies]] and commercial interests in Brazil, Africa, India and the Far East, resulting in the loss of the Portuguese Indian sea trade monopoly.
[[File:John V of Portugal Pompeo Batoni.jpg|thumb|right|upright|King [[John V of Portugal|John V]] patronized numerous artistic works, earning him the epithet of the ''Portuguese Sun King''.]]
In 1640, [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king. The [[Portuguese Restoration War]] ended the sixty-year period of the [[Iberian Union]] under the [[House of Habsburg]]. This was the beginning of the [[House of Braganza]], which reigned in Portugal until 1910.

King John IV's eldest son came to reign as [[Afonso VI of Portugal|Afonso VI]], however his physical and mental disabilities left him overpowered by [[Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor]]. In a palace coup organized by the King's wife, [[Maria Francisca of Savoy]], and his brother, [[Peter II of Portugal|Pedro, Duke of Beja]], King Afonso VI was declared mentally incompetent and exiled first to the Azores and then to the [[Sintra National Palace|Royal Palace of Sintra]], outside Lisbon. After Afonso's death, Pedro came to the throne as King Pedro II. Pedro's reign saw the consolidation of national independence, imperial expansion, and investment in domestic production.

Pedro II's son, [[John V of Portugal|John V]], saw a reign characterized by the influx of gold into the coffers of the royal treasury, supplied largely by the [[royal fifth]] (a tax on precious metals) that was received from the [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese colonies]] of [[State of Brazil|Brazil]] and [[State of Maranhão (colonial)|Maranhão]]. Acting as an absolute monarch, John nearly depleted his country's tax revenues on ambitious architectural works, most notably [[Mafra National Palace|Mafra Palace]], and on commissions and additions for his sizable art and literary collections.

Official estimates&amp;nbsp;– and most estimates made so far&amp;nbsp;– place the number of Portuguese migrants to [[Colonial Brazil]] during the gold rush of the 18th century at 600,000.&lt;ref name="ibge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html |title=IBGE teen |publisher=Ibge.gov.br |accessdate=11 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125045233/http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html |archivedate=25 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This represented one of the largest movements of European populations to their colonies in the Americas during colonial times.

[[File:O marques de pombal, conde de Oeiras.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|1st Marquis of Pombal]] effectively ruled Portugal during the reign of King [[Joseph I of Portugal|José I]].]]
In 1738, [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal]], began a diplomatic career as the Portuguese Ambassador in London and later in Vienna. The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Mary Anne of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria]], was fond of Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]], however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, Joseph I of Portugal, was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the [[Queen Mother]]'s approval, he appointed Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs.

As the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebastião de Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India; reorganized the army and the navy; restructured the [[University of Coimbra]], and ended discrimination against different [[Christian]] sects in Portugal.

But Sebastião de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.

Disaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755, when [[Lisbon]] was struck by [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|a violent earthquake]] with an estimated [[Moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 8.5–9. The city was razed to the ground by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami and ensuing fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nisee.berkeley.edu/lisbon/index.html |title=Historical Depictions of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake |publisher=Nisee.berkeley.edu |date=12 November 1998 |accessdate=6 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311082423/http://nisee.berkeley.edu/lisbon/index.html |archivedate=11 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sebastião de Melo survived by a stroke of luck and then immediately embarked on rebuilding the city, with his famous quote: "What now? We bury the dead and take care of the living."

Despite the calamity and huge [[death toll]], Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt. The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline City Centre still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions. Sebastião de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.

Following the earthquake, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] gave his Prime Minister even more power, and Sebastião de Melo became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[Távora affair|Távora family]] and the [[Dukes of Aveiro|Duke of Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebastião de Melo prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy. Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in 1759.

In 1762, [[Spanish–Portuguese War, 1761–1763|Spain invaded Portuguese territory]] as part of the [[Seven Years' War]], but by 1763 the ''status quo'' between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored.

Following the Távora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Made "Marquis of Pombal" in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1779. 

The new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], disliked the Marquis because of the power he amassed, and never forgave him for the ruthlessness with which he dispatched the Távora family, and upon her accession to the throne, she withdrew all his political offices. The Marquis of Pombal died on his estate at [[Pombal, Portugal|Pombal]] in 1782.

However, historians also argue that Pombal’s "enlightenment," while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91–108, 160–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1807, [[Napoleon]] moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal. From 1807 to 1811, British-Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the [[Peninsular War|French invasion of Portugal]], while the royal family and the Portuguese [[nobility]], including Maria I, relocated to the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese territory of Brazil]], at that time a colony of the [[Portuguese Empire]], in South America. This episode is known as the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]].

With the occupation by Napoleon, Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline that lasted until the 20th century. This decline was hastened by the independence in 1822 of the country's largest colonial possession, Brazil. In 1807, as Napoleon's army closed in on Lisbon, the [[Prince Regent]] [[João VI of Portugal]] [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|transferred his court]] to Brazil and established [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it, forming a pluricontinental State, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]].
[[File:Portuguese Constitution of 1826.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The frontispiece of the 1826 Portuguese Constitution featuring King-Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]] and his daughter Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]]]
As a result of the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family, Brazilian administrative, civic, [[Economic history of Brazil#The economy at independence, 1822|economical]], military, [[Education in Brazil#History|educational]], and [[Brazilian science and technology#History|scientific]] apparatus were expanded and highly modernized. Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the [[French Invasion of Portugal]] and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that João VI would have been able to return safely to Lisbon. However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], which started in [[Porto]], demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.

Thus he returned to Portugal but left his son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in charge of Brazil. When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] from Portugal. [[Cisplatina]] (today's sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.

Brazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of ''Emperor of Brazil''. John VI's death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]. However, Pedro's brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Infante Miguel]], claimed the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter's rights to the throne, Pedro launched the [[Portuguese Civil War|Liberal Wars]] to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with Miguel's defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.

Queen Maria II  (Mary II) and King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II]]'s son, King [[Pedro V]] (Peter V) modernized the country during his short reign (1853–1861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the [[cholera]] outbreak of 1853–1856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro's reign was short, as he died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers [[Infante Fernando of Portugal|Infante Fernando]] and [[Infante João, Duke of Beja]], and his wife, [[Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. Not having children, his brother, [[Luís I of Portugal]] (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his modernization.

At the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia. [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], [[Bissau]], [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]], [[Porto Amboim]] and the [[Island of Mozambique]] were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.

With the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Conference of Berlin]] of 1884, Portuguese Africa territories had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Portuguese Africa's cities and towns like [[Nova Lisboa]], [[Lubango|Sá da Bandeira]], [[Kuito|Silva Porto]], [[Malanje]], [[Tete]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Pery]] and [[Vila Cabral]] were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Namibe|Moçâmedes]], [[Lobito]], [[João Belo]], [[Nacala]] and [[Porto Amélia]] were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the [[Benguela railway]] in Angola, and the [[Beira railway]] in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.

Other episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its "[[Pink Map]]", which clashed with British aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]].

The Portuguese territories in Africa were [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. The tiny fortress of [[São João Baptista de Ajudá]] on the coast of [[Dahomey]], was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and [[Macau]].

On 1 February 1908, the king Dom [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his [[heir apparent]], [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Prince Royal Dom Luís Filipe]], [[Duke of Braganza]], [[Lisbon Regicide|were murdered in Lisbon]]. Under his rule, Portugal had twice been declared [[bankrupt]]&amp;nbsp;– on 14 June 1892, and again on 10 May 1902&amp;nbsp;– causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. [[Manuel II of Portugal]] became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the [[5 October 1910 revolution]], which abolished the regime and instated [[republicanism]] in Portugal.

=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===

{{Main|Portuguese First Republic|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}
Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[Portuguese First Republic]]. These conditions would lead to the failed [[Monarchy of the North]], [[28 May 1926 coup d'état]], and the creation of the National Dictatorship (''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'').
This in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.

Portugal was one of only five European countries to remain neutral in [[World War II]]. 
From the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not as a colonial empire.

After India attained independence in 1947, pro-Indian residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organisations, separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.&lt;ref name =lele&gt;P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, [[São João Baptista de Ajudá]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire.
[[File:Antonio Salazar-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[António de Oliveira Salazar]] ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1968, within the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.]]
According to the census of 1921 São João Baptista de Ajudá had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty.

Another forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]].

The [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations resulted in the defeat]] and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National Assembly until the military coup of 1974.

Also in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974).

Throughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. However, the authoritarian and conservative [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, first installed and governed by [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] and from 1968 onwards led by [[Marcelo Caetano]], tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |title=Portugal Não É Um País Pequeno |publisher=Purl.pt |accessdate=21 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141025060609/http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carnation Revolution and European integration ===
{{Main|Carnation Revolution|Portuguese transition to democracy}}
[[File:Portuguese colonial war map1.PNG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Portuguese Africa]] before independence in 1975]]
The Portuguese government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucionário Em Curso]]''). This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], [[The Economist]] (16 August 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], [[Time Magazine]] (7 July 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

Over one million [[White African#Portuguese in Africa|Portuguese refugee]]s fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. [[Mário Soares]] and [[António de Almeida Santos]] were charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held [[Portuguese Constituent Assembly election, 1975|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.

Portugal continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salvação Nacional]] until the [[Portuguese legislative election, 1976|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] (PS) and Mário Soares, its leader, became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. Mário Soares would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985. In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution, during the last decade of the previous regime. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.
[[File:Portugese minister Soares (voorzitter Socialistische Partij) op Schiphol aangeko, Bestanddeelnr 927-7110.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Mário Soares]] became Portugal's first democratically elected Prime-Minister in 1976.]]
Portugal bounced between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization]]s were enforced; the [[Portuguese Constitution]] (approved in 1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution was a highly charged ideological document with numerous references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. Portugal's economic situation after its transition to democracy, obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilization programs in 1977–78 and 1983–85.

In 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that later became the European Union (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU [[structural and cohesion funds]] and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.

Portugal's last overseas territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution, but interrupted by an [[Indonesia]]n armed invasion and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]].
[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when Portugal held the presidency for the [[European Council]].]]
On 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. [[Expo '98]] took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[eurozone]].

On 5 July 2004, [[José Manuel Barroso]], then [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]], the most powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[Jerónimos Monastery]], in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action. The [[Republic of Ireland]] was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty; it was initially rejected by voters in 2008.

Economic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt|borrowing costs]] in the wake of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.

The territory of Portugal includes an area in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (referred to as ''the continent'' by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores. It lies between latitudes [[32nd parallel north|32°]] and [[43rd parallel north|43° N]], and longitudes [[32nd meridian west|32°]] and [[6th meridian west|6° W]].

[[Continental Portugal|Mainland Portugal]] is split by its main river, the [[Tagus]], that flows from Spain and disgorges in Tagus Estuary, in Lisbon, before escaping into the Atlantic. The northern landscape is mountainous towards the interior with several plateaus indented by river valleys, whereas the south, including the [[Algarve]] and the [[Alentejo]] regions, is characterized by rolling plains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vieira|first1=Gonçalo|last2=Luís|first2=Zêzere José|last3=Mora|first3=Carla|title=Landscapes and Landforms of Portugal|date=2018|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319036403|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal's highest peak is the similarly named [[Mount Pico]] on the island of [[Pico Island|Pico]] in the Azores. This ancient volcano, which measures {{convert|2351|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} is an iconic symbol of the Azores, while the [[Serra da Estrela]] on the mainland (the summit being {{convert|1991|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level) is an important seasonal attraction for skiers and winter sports enthusiasts.

The archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores are scattered within the Atlantic Ocean: the Azores straddling the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] on a tectonic triple junction, and Madeira along a range formed by [[plate tectonics|in-plate]] [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] geology. Geologically, these islands were formed by volcanic and seismic events. The last terrestrial volcanic eruption occurred in 1957–58 ([[Capelinhos]]) and minor earthquakes occur sporadically, usually of low intensity.

[[Exclusive economic zone of Portugal|Portugal's exclusive economic zone]], a sea zone over which the Portuguese have special rights over the exploration and use of marine resources, has 1,727,408&amp;nbsp;km². This is the 3rd largest [[exclusive economic zone]] of the European Union and the 11th largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/portugal/interior/portugal-tenta-duplicar-territorio-maritimo-8703814.html|title=Portugal tenta duplicar território marítimo (in Portuguese)|last=Francisco|first=Susete|date=14 August 2017|website=Diário de Notícias|access-date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however, variations from the highlands to the lowlands: Rivas Martinez, presents several different bioclimatic zones for Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalbioclimatics.org/form/tb_med.htm|title=Mapas bioclimáticos y biogeográficos|website=Globalbioclimatics.org|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Algarve]], separated from the [[Alentejo]] region by mountains reaching up to {{convert|900|m|ft}} in Alto de Fóia, has a climate similar to that of the southern coastal areas of Spain or Southwest Australia.

Annual average rainfall in the mainland varies from just over {{convert|3200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the northern mountains to less than {{convert|300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the area of the Massueime River, near Côa, along the [[Douro]] river.

In some areas, such as the Guadiana basin, annual average temperatures can be as high as {{convert|28|°C|°F}}, and summer highest temperatures routinely are over {{convert|40|°C|°F}}. The record high of {{convert|47.1|°C|°F}} was recorded in [[Amareleja]], although this might not be the hottest spot in summer, according to satellite readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extremos climáticos de temperatura, Capitais Distrito|url=http://www.ipma.pt/pt/oclima/extremos.clima/|publisher=Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera|accessdate=23 January 2013|author=Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera|language=Portuguese|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipma.pt/pt/oclima/extremos.clima/|title=Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera, IP Portugal|publisher=ipma.pt |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowfalls occur regularly in the winter in the interior North and Centre of the country in districts such as [[Guarda District|Guarda]], [[Bragança District|Bragança]], [[Viseu]] and [[Vila Real District|Vila Real]], particularly on the mountains. In winter temperatures may drop below {{convert|-10.0|°C|°F}} in particular in [[Serra da Estrela]], [[Serra do Gerês]], [[Serra do Marão]] and [[Montesinho Natural Park|Serra de Montesinho]]. In these places snow can fall any time from October to May. In the South of the country snowfalls are rare but still occur in the highest elevations. While the official absolute minimum by [[Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera|IPMA]] is {{convert|-16.0|°C|°F}} in [[Penhas da Saúde]] and [[Miranda do Douro]], lower temperatures have been recorded, such as {{convert|-17.5|°C|°F}} by [[Bragança, Portugal|Bragança]] Polytechnic Institute in the outskirts of the city in 1983, and below {{convert|-20.0|°C|°F}} in Serra da Estrela.

Portugal has around 2500 to 3200 hours of sunshine a year, an average of 4–6&amp;nbsp;h in winter and 10–12&amp;nbsp;h in the summer, with higher values in the south-east and lower in the north-west.

The [[sea surface temperature]] on the west coast of mainland Portugal varies from {{convert|12|-|15|°C|°F|1}} in winter to {{convert|18|-|22|°C|°F|1}} in the summer while on the south coast it ranges from {{convert|15|°C|°F|1}} in winter and rises in the summer to about {{convert|23|°C|°F|1}} occasionally reaching {{convert|26|°C|°F|1}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Both the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira have a subtropical climate, although variations between islands exist, making weather predictions very difficult (owing to rough topography). The Madeira and Azorean archipelagos have a narrower temperature range, with annual average temperatures exceeding {{convert|20|°C|°F}} along the coast (according to the Portuguese Meteorological Institute). Some islands in Azores do have drier months in the summer. Consequently, the island of the Azores have been identified as having a [[Mediterranean]] climate (both ''Csa'' and ''Csb'' types), while some islands (such as [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] or [[Corvo Island|Corvo]]) are classified as Maritime Temperate (''Cfb'') and Humid subtropical (''Cfa''), respectively, according to Köppen-Geiger classification.

[[Porto Santo]] island in Madeira has a semi-arid steppe climate (''BSh''). The [[Savage Islands]], which are part of the regional territory of Madeira and a nature reserve are unique in being classified as a desert climate (''BWh'') with an annual average rainfall of approximately {{convert|150|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The sea surface temperature in the archipelagos varies from {{convert|17|-|18|°C|°F|1}} in winter to {{convert|24|-|25|°C|°F|1}} in the summer occasionally reaching {{convert|25|°C|°F|1}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Biodiversity ===
[[File:Geres1.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Peneda-Gerês National Park]] is the only nationally-designated park in Portugal, owing to the rarity and significance of its environment.]]
Despite the fact that humans have occupied the territory of Portugal for thousands of years, something still remains of the original vegetation. In [[Gerês]] both mature deciduous and coniferous forests can be found, an extremely rare worldwide mature Mediterranean forest remain in some parts of the [[Arrábida]] mountain and a subtropical [[laurissilva]] forest, dating back to the Tertiary period, covers its largest continuous area in the world in the Madeira main island. Due to the human population decrease and rural exodus, Pyrenean oak and other local native trees are colonizing many abandoned areas.

[[Boar]], Iberian red deer, roe deer, and the Iberian wild goat, are reported to have expanded greatly during recent decades. Boars were found recently roaming at night inside large urban areas, like in [[Setubal]]. [[Protected areas of Portugal]] include one national park ({{lang-pt|Parque Nacional}}), 12 natural parks ({{lang-pt|Parque Natural}}), nine natural reserves ({{lang-pt|Reserva Natural}}), five natural monuments ({{lang-pt|Monumento Natural}}), and seven protected landscapes ({{lang-pt|Paisagem Protegida}}), which include the [[Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês]], the [[Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela]] and the [[Paul de Arzila|Paul d'Arzila]].

These natural environments are shaped by diverse flora, and include widespread species of pine (especially the ''[[Pinus pinaster]]'' and ''[[Pinus pinea]]'' species), the English oak (''[[Quercus robur]]''), the Pyrenean oak (''[[Quercus pyrenaica]]'') the chestnut (''[[Castanea sativa]]''), the cork-oak (''[[Quercus suber]]''), the holm oak (''[[Quercus ilex]]'') or the Portuguese oak (''[[Quercus faginea]]''). Due to their economic value, some species of the genus ''Eucalyptus'' were introduced and are now common, despite their environmental impact.

[[Laurisilva]] is a unique type of subtropical rainforest, which nowadays, in Europe, is only restricted to the Iberian Peninsula: in the Azores, and in particular on the island of Madeira, there are large forests of endemic ''Laurisilva'' forests (the latter protected as a natural heritage preserve).
There are several species of diverse [[mammal]]ian fauna, including the [[fox]], [[badger]], [[iberian lynx]], [[iberian wolf]], [[wild goat]] (''[[Capra pyrenaica]]''), wild cat (''[[Felis silvestris]]''), [[hare]], [[weasel]], [[European polecat|polecat]], [[chameleon]], [[mongoose]], [[civet]], [[brown bear]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} (spotted near Rio Minho, close to Peneda-Gerês) and many others. Portugal is an important stopover for migratory birds, in places such as [[Cape St. Vincent]] or the [[Serra de Monchique|Monchique]] mountains, where thousands of birds cross from Europe to Africa during the autumn or in the spring (return migration).

Most of the avian species congregate along the [[Iberian Peninsula]] since it is the closest stopover between Northern Europe and Africa. Six hundred bird species occur in Portugal (either for nesting or during the course of migration), and annually there are new registries of nesting species. The archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are transient stopover for American, European, and African birds, while continental Portugal mostly encounters European and African bird species.

There are more than 100 freshwater fish species, varying from the giant European catfish (in the Tagus International Natural Park) to some small and endemic species that live only in small lakes (along the western portion of country, for example). Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss, pollution and drought. Up-welling along the west coast of Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish; the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world. [[Marine fish]] species are more common, and include thousands of species, such as the [[sardine]] (''Sardina pilchardus''), [[tuna]] and [[Atlantic mackerel]]. Bioluminescent species are also well represented (including species in different colour spectrum and forms), like the glowing plankton that are possible to observe in some beaches.

There are many endemic insect species, most only found in certain parts of Portugal, while other species are more widespread like the [[stag beetle]] (''Lucanus cervus'') and the [[cicada]]. The [[Macaronesia]]n islands (Azores and Madeira) have many endemic species (like birds, reptiles, bats, insects, snails and slugs) that evolved independently from other regions of Portugal. In Madeira, for example, it is possible to observe more than 250 species of land [[gastropods]].

Portugal has been a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] since the ratification of the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1976|Constitution of 1976]], with [[Lisbon]], the nation's largest city, as its capital. The Constitution grants the division or separation of powers among four bodies referred as "organs of Sovereignty": the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]], the [[Government of Portugal|Government]], the [[Portuguese parliament|Assembly of the Republic]] and the [[Judiciary of Portugal|Courts]].&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt;

The President, who is elected to a five-year term, has an executive role: the current President is [[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]]. The Assembly of the Republic is a single chamber parliament composed of 230 deputies elected for a four-year term. The Government is headed by the [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] (currently [[António Costa]]) and includes Ministers and Secretaries of State. The [[Courts]] are organized into several levels, among the judicial, administrative and fiscal branches. The [[Portuguese Supreme Court|Supreme Courts]] are institutions of last resort/appeal. A thirteen-member [[Portuguese Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]] oversees the constitutionality of the laws.

Portugal operates a multi-party system of competitive legislatures/local administrative governments at the national, regional and local levels. The Assembly of the Republic, Regional Assemblies and local municipalities and parishes, are dominated by two political parties, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], in addition to the [[Unitary Democratic Coalition]] ([[Portuguese Communist Party]] and [[Ecologist Party "The Greens"]]), the [[Left Bloc]] and the [[Democratic and Social Centre&amp;nbsp;– People's Party]], which garner between 5 and 15% of the vote regularly.

=== Presidency of the Republic ===
[[File:Portugal (17135381862).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Belém Palace]] serves as the official residence and workplace of the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]].]]
{{main|President of Portugal|List of Presidents of Portugal}}
The Head of State of Portugal is the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]], elected to a five-year term by direct, [[universal suffrage]]. He or she has also supervision and [[reserve power]]s. Presidential powers include the appointment of the Prime Minister and the other members of the Government (where the President takes into account the results of legislative elections); dismissing the Prime Minister; dissolving the Assembly of the Republic (to call early elections); [[veto]]ing legislation (which may be overridden by the Assembly); and declaring a state of war or siege. The President is also the ''[[ex officio]]'' Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.

The President is advised on issues of importance by the [[Portuguese Council of State|Council of State]], which is composed of six senior civilian officers, any former Presidents elected under the 1976 Constitution, five-members chosen by the Assembly, and five selected by the president.

=== Government ===
{{main|Government of Portugal|Prime Minister of Portugal|List of Prime Ministers of Portugal}}
[[File:Lisbon holiday (18607400288).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Praça do Comércio]] houses multiple ministries of the [[Government of Portugal]].]]
The Government is headed by the presidentially appointed [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]], also including one or more Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers, Secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries of State.

The Government is both the organ of sovereignty that conducts the general politics of the country and the superior body of the public administration.

It has essentially Executive powers, but has also limited Legislative powers. The Government can legislate about its own organization, about areas covered by legislative authorizations conceded by the Assembly of the Republic and about the specific regulation of generalist laws issued by the Assembly.

The [[Council of Ministers (Portugal)|Council of Ministers]] – under the presidency of the Prime Minister (or the President of Portugal at the latter's request) and the Ministers (may also include one or more Deputy Prime Ministers) – acts as the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Each government is required to define the broad outline of its policies in a programme, and present it to the Assembly for a mandatory period of debate. The failure of the Assembly to reject the government programme by an absolute majority of deputies confirms the cabinet in office.

=== Parliament ===
[[File:Lisbon, Portugal (Sharon Hahn Darlin) São Bento.jpg|thumb|250px|[[São Bento Palace]] is the seat of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portuguese Legislature]].]]
{{main|Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)}}
The [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]], in Lisbon is the national [[parliament]] of Portugal. It is the main Legislative body, although the Government also has limited legislative powers.

The Assembly of the Republic is a unicameral body composed of up to 230 deputies. Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[Closed list|closed]] [[party-list proportional representation]], deputies serve four-year terms of office, unless the President dissolves the Assembly and calls for new elections.

Currently the Government ([[Socialist Party (Portugal)|PS]]) and the parties supporting it through a [[Confidence and supply|confidence-and-supply agreement]] ([[Left Bloc|BE]], [[Portuguese Communist Party|PCP]], [[Ecologist Party "The Greens"|PEV]]) control parliament with the most seats. The [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|PSD]] and [[CDS – People's Party|CDS-PP]] parties form the opposition to the government alongside a single seat held by [[People–Animals–Nature|PAN]].

{{main|Judiciary of Portugal|Law of Portugal|Drug policy of Portugal|LGBT rights in Portugal}}
The Portuguese legal system is part of the civil law legal system, also called the continental family legal system. The main laws include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the [[Portuguese Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code of Portugal]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended).

The supreme national courts are the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Portugal)|Supreme Court of Justice]] and the [[Constitutional Court of Portugal|Constitutional Court]]. The [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]], headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.

Portuguese law applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continues to be the major influence for those countries.

Portugal was the first country in the world to abolish [[life imprisonment]] (in 1884) and was one of the first countries to abolish the death penalty. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years.

Portugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001, the first country in the world to do so. Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including [[cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[LSD]]. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than "10 days worth of personal use" are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with the number of [[HIV]] infection cases, which had dropped 50 percent by 2009. Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined, however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Vastag [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization 5 Years After: Portugal's Drug Decriminalization Policy Shows Positive Results].

=== LGBT+ rights in Portugal ===
{{main|LGBT rights in Portugal}}

[[LGBT rights in Portugal|LGBT+ rights]] have increased substantially in the past years.

=== Law enforcement ===
[[File:Render da Guarda no Palacio de Belem 22.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A cavalryman of the [[National Republican Guard (Portugal)|National Republican Guard]]'s honor guard]]
{{main|Law enforcement in Portugal}}
Portugal's main police organizations are the ''[[Guarda Nacional Republicana]]&amp;nbsp;– GNR'' ([[National Republican Guard (Portugal)|National Republican Guard]]), a [[gendarmerie]]; the ''[[Polícia de Segurança Pública]]&amp;nbsp;– PSP'' (Public Security Police), a civilian police force who work in urban areas; and the ''[[Polícia Judiciária]]&amp;nbsp;– PJ'' (Judicial Police), a highly specialized criminal investigation police that is overseen by the [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]].

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Portugal}}
Administratively, Portugal is divided into 308 [[municipalities of Portugal|municipalities]] ({{lang-pt|municípios or [[concelhos]]}}), which after a reform in [[Portuguese local election, 2013|2013]] are subdivided into 3,092 civil parishes ({{lang-pt|[[freguesia]]}}). Operationally, the municipality and civil parish, along with the national government, are the only legally identifiable [[local administrative unit]]s identified by the government of Portugal (for example, cities, towns or villages have no standing in law, although may be used as catchment for the defining services). For statistical purposes the Portuguese government also identifies [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]], inter-municipal communities and informally, the district system, used until European integration (and being phased-out by the national government).{{Original research inline|date=February 2016}} Continental Portugal is agglomerated into 18 districts, while the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are governed as [[autonomous area|autonomous regions]]; the largest units, established since 1976, are either [[mainland Portugal]] ({{lang-pt|Portugal Continental}}) and the [[autonomous regions of Portugal]] ([[Azores]] and [[Madeira]]).

The 18 districts of mainland Portugal are: [[Aveiro District|Aveiro]], [[Beja District|Beja]], [[Braga District|Braga]], [[Bragança District|Bragança]], [[Castelo Branco District|Castelo Branco]], [[Coimbra District|Coimbra]], [[Évora District|Évora]], [[Faro District|Faro]], [[Guarda District|Guarda]], [[Leiria District|Leiria]], [[Lisbon District|Lisbon]], [[Portalegre District|Portalegre]], [[Porto District|Porto]], [[Santarém District|Santarém]], [[Setúbal District|Setúbal]], [[Viana do Castelo District|Viana do Castelo]], [[Vila Real District|Vila Real]] and [[Viseu District|Viseu]]&amp;nbsp;– each district takes the name of the district capital.

Within the European Union NUTS ([[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]]) system, Portugal is divided into seven regions: the [[Azores]], [[Alentejo]], [[Algarve]], [[Centro, Portugal|Centro]], [[Lisboa Region|Lisboa]], [[Madeira]] and [[Norte, Portugal|Norte]], and with the exception of the Azores and Madeira, these NUTS areas are subdivided into 28 subregions.

{{Main|Foreign relations of Portugal}}
A member state of the [[United Nations]] since 1955, Portugal is also a founding member of [[NATO]] (1949), [[OECD]] (1961) and [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] (1960); it left the last in 1986 to join the [[European Economic Community]], which became the European Union in 1993. In 1996 it co-founded the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP), which seeks to foster closer economic and cultural ties between the world's [[Lusophone]] nations.

[[António Guterres]], who has served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002 and [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] from 2005 to 2015, assumed the post of [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] on 1 January 2017; making him the first Secretary-General from Western Europe since [[Kurt Waldheim]] of Austria (1972–1981), the first former head of government to become Secretary-General and the first Secretary-General born after the establishment of the United Nations on 26 June 1945.

In addition, Portugal is a full member of the [[Latin Union]] (1983) and the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]] (1949). It has a friendship alliance and [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] treaty with its former colony, Brazil. Portugal and England (subsequently, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) share the world's oldest active military accord through their [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]] ([[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]]), which was signed in 1373.

There are two international territorial disputes, both with Spain:

*[[Olivenza]]. Under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297, the municipality of Olivenza was ceded to Spain under the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)|Treaty of Badajoz]] in 1801, after the [[War of the Oranges]]. Portugal claimed it back in 1815 under the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]]. However, since the 19th century, it has been continuously ruled by Spain which considers the territory theirs not only ''de facto'' but also ''de jure''.&lt;ref name="One-europe.net_2017-09-29"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://one-europe.net/portugal-spain-the-territorial-disputes-of-olivenza-and-the-savage-islands| title=Portugal &amp;amp; Spain - the territorial disputes of Olivenza and the Savage Islands (Part II) - OneEurope| newspaper=One-europe.net| date= 11 February 2015| author=| accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Ilhas Selvagens ([[Savage Islands]]). The archipelago is under Portuguese domination but is geographically closer to the [[Canary Islands]] (165&amp;nbsp;km) than to [[Madeira]] (280&amp;nbsp;km). Found in 1364 by Italian navigators, the islands belonged to private owners until 1971, when the Portuguese government bought them and established a natural reserve area covering the whole archipelago. The islands have been claimed by Spain since 1911 and the dispute has caused some periods of political tension between the two countries. The main problem is not so much their intrinsic value but the fact that they expand considerably to the south the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of Portugal.&lt;ref name="Algarvedailynews.com_2017-09-29"&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.algarvedailynews.com/features/environment/4361-new-maritime-area-in-dispute-between-portugal-and-spain| title=New maritime area in dispute between Portugal and Spain| newspaper=Algarvedailynews.com| date=| author=| accessdate=29 September 2017| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929135147/http://www.algarvedailynews.com/features/environment/4361-new-maritime-area-in-dispute-between-portugal-and-spain| archivedate=29 September 2017| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
{{Main|Portuguese Armed Forces}}

The armed forces have three branches: [[Portuguese Navy|Navy]], [[Portuguese Army|Army]] and [[Portuguese Air Force|Air Force]]. They serve primarily as a self-defense force whose mission is to protect the territorial integrity of the country and provide humanitarian assistance and security at home and abroad. {{As of|2008}}, the three branches numbered 39,200 active personnel including 7,500 women. [[List of countries by military expenditures|Portuguese military expenditure]] in 2009 was billion, representing 2.1 percent of GDP. Military conscription was abolished in 2004. The minimum age for voluntary recruitment is 18 years.

The Army (21,000 personnel) comprises three brigades and other small units. An [[Portuguese Intervention Brigade|infantry brigade]] (mainly equipped with [[Pandur II]] [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]), a [[Portuguese Mechanized Brigade|mechanized brigade]] (mainly equipped with [[Leopard 2|Leopard 2 A6]] tanks and [[M113]] APC) and a [[Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade|Rapid Reaction Brigade]] (consisting of [[Paratroopers' Regiment|Paratroopers]], [[Portuguese Army Commandos|commandos]] and Rangers). The Navy (10,700 personnel, of which 1,580 are [[Portuguese Marines|marines]]), the world's oldest surviving naval force, has five frigates, seven corvettes, two submarines, and 28 patrol and auxiliary vessels. The Air Force (7,500 personnel) has the [[Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and the [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet]] as the main combat aircraft.

|}

In addition to the three branches of the armed forces, there is the [[National Republican Guard (Portugal)|National Republican Guard]], a security force subject to military law and organization ([[gendarmerie]]) comprising 25,000 personnel. This force is under the authority of both the Defense and the Interior Ministry. It has provided detachments for participation in international operations in Iraq and East Timor.

The United States maintains a military presence with 770 troops in the [[Lajes Air Base]] at [[Terceira Island]], in the Azores. The [[Allied Joint Force Command Lisbon]] (JFC Lisbon)&amp;nbsp;– one of the three main subdivisions of [[NATO]]'s [[Allied Command Operations]]&amp;nbsp;– it is based in [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]], near Lisbon.

In the 20th century, Portugal engaged in two major conflicts: [[Portugal in the Great War|World War I]] and the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974). After the end of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in 1975, the Portuguese Armed Forces have participated in peacekeeping missions in East Timor, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq ([[Nasiriyah]]), Lebanon, [[Mali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/portuguese-soldier-killed-serving-in-mali/42332|title=Portuguese soldier killed serving in Mali|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/portuguese-troops-in-large-un-operation-in-central-african-republic/43458|title=Portuguese troops in 'large' UN operation in Central African Republic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal also conducted several independent unilateral military operations abroad, as were the cases of the interventions of the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola in 1992 and in Guinea-Bissau in 1998 with the main objectives of protecting and withdrawing of Portuguese and foreign citizens threatened by local civil conflicts.

[[File:Portuguese debt and EU average.png|thumb|200px|alt=Portuguese debt compared to Eurozone average|Debt as a percentage of the [[economy of Portugal]], compared to eurozone average]]

The Portuguese government is heavily indebted, and received a 78 billion euro bailout from the [[European Union]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] in May 2011.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/business/global/portugals-debt-efforts-may-be-a-warning-for-greece.html|title=Portugal’s Debt Efforts May Be a Warning for Greece|first=Landon Thomas|last=Jr|date=14 February 2012|accessdate=2 August 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of Portugal’s debt to its overall economy, was 107 percent when it received the bailout.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; As part of the deal, the country agreed to cut its budget deficit from 9.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to 5.9 percent in 2011, 4.5 percent in 2012 and 3 percent in 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/12/13/portugal-deficit-idUKL6E7ND4O320111213|title=Portugal 2011 deficit to beat goal on one-off revs-PM|work=Reuters UK|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the bailout was announced, the Portuguese government headed by [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] managed to implement measures with the intention of improving the state's financial situation, including tax hikes, a freeze of civil service-related lower-wages and cuts of higher-wages by 14.3%, on top of the government's spending cuts. The Portuguese government also agreed to eliminate its [[golden share]] in [[Portugal Telecom]] which gave it veto power over vital decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Kowsmann, Patricia, [http://www.totaltele.com/view.aspx?ID=466059 "Portugal govt ends golden-share holdings" (Paid content)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031181155/http://www.totaltele.com/view.aspx?ID=466059 |date=31 October 2013 }}, Dow Jones Newswires 5 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/portugal-goldenshares/update-1-portugal-scraps-golden-shares-in-utilities-idUKLDE76414L20110705|title=UPDATE 1-Portugal scraps golden shares in utilities|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, all public servants had already seen an average wage cut of 20% relative to their 2010 baseline, with cuts reaching 25% for those earning more than 1,500 euro per month.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Management Technology Nagpur: [http://okonomos.weebly.com/uploads/4/8/3/6/4836267/okonomist.pdf "Eurocrisis"], Okonomist, Vol.1, Issue 3, January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The IMF, the [[European Commission]] (EC) and the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) said in September 2012 that Portugal’s debt would peak at 124 percent of gross domestic product in 2014.&lt;ref name="October 2012 status"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_03/10/2012_464362|title=Portugal seeks market access with $5 bln bond exchange|publisher=Kathimerini (English Edition)|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMF previously said in July 2012 that Portugal’s debt would peak at about 118.5 percent of GDP in 2013.&lt;ref name="October 2012 status"/&gt; In September 2013, the Portuguese Government reviewed again the public debt of Portugal for 2013 to 127.8 percent, after a peak of 130.9 percent in that month.&lt;ref name="September 2013 status"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publico.pt/economia/noticia/divida-publica-revista-em-alta-para-1278-do-pib-em-2013-1607574|title=Dívida pública revista em alta para 127,8% do PIB em 2013 (Valor supera previsões iniciais do Governo, da troika e do FMI.)|publisher=Lusa and Público|date=30 September 2013|accessdate=30 October 2013|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report released in January 2011 by the [[Diário de Notícias]]&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://www.dn.pt/inicio/tv/interior.aspx?content_id=1797055&amp;seccao=Media "O estado a que o Estado chegou" no 2.º lugar do top] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513031840/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/tv/interior.aspx?content_id=1797055&amp;seccao=Media |date=13 May 2013 }}, [[Diário de Notícias]] (2 March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and published in Portugal by [[Gradiva]], had demonstrated that in the period between the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974 and 2010, the democratic [[Government of Portugal|Portuguese Republic government]]s encouraged over-expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear [[Public–private partnership]]s and funding of numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advisory of committees and firms.
This allowed considerable [[slippage (finance)|slippage]] in state-managed [[public works]] and inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages. Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants. Risky [[credit (finance)|credit]], [[public debt]] creation, and European [[structural and cohesion funds]] were mismanaged across almost four decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://www.dn.pt/inicio/tv/interior.aspx?content_id=1797055&amp;seccao=Media "O estado a que o Estado chegou" no 2.º lugar do top] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513031840/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/tv/interior.aspx?content_id=1797055&amp;seccao=Media |date=13 May 2013 }}, [[Diário de Notícias]] (2 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], it was known in 2008–2009 that two Portuguese banks ([[Banco Português de Negócios]] (BPN) and [[Banco Privado Português]] (BPP)) had been accumulating losses for years due to bad investments, embezzlement and accounting fraud. The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications – Portugal's then President, Cavaco Silva and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://expresso.sapo.pt/bpn-oliveira-costa-vendeu-a-cavaco-e-filha-250-mil-acoes-da-sln=f643506 BPN Oliveira Costa vendeu a Cavaco e filha 250 mil ações da SLN – Expresso.pt].

In the second decade of the 21st century, the Portuguese economy suffered its most severe recession since the 1970s, resulting in the country having to be bailed out by the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). The bailout, agreed to in 2011, required Portugal to enter into a range of austerity measures in exchange for funding support of €78,000,000,000. In May 2014, the country exited the bailout but reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining its reformist momentum. At the time of exiting the bailout, the economy had contracted by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2014; however, unemployment, while still high, had fallen to 15.3%.&lt;ref name="PortugalBailoutEnds"&gt;{{cite news|title=Portugal follows Ireland out of bailout programme|url=http://www.europesun.com/index.php/sid/222083311/scat/88176adfdf246af5/ht/Portugal-follows-Ireland-out-of-bailout-programme|accessdate=18 May 2014|publisher=''Europe Sun''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Global Competitiveness Report]] for 2014–2015, published by the [[World Economic Forum]], placed Portugal on the 36th position on the economic index. 

The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s quality of life index placed Portugal as the country with the 19th-best quality of life in the world for 2005, ahead of other economically and technologically advanced countries like France, Germany, the United Kingdom and South Korea, but 9 places behind its sole neighbor, Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf\format=PDF|title=The Economist Intelligence Unit’s quality-of-life index|website=Economist.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite the fact that Portugal remains as one of the countries with the lowest per capita GDP in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="economia.publico.clix.pt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economia.publico.pt/Noticia/portugueses-perderam-poder-de-compra-entre-2005-e-2007-e-estao-na-cauda-da-zona-euro_1352732|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614211911/http://economia.publico.pt/Noticia/portugueses-perderam-poder-de-compra-entre-2005-e-2007-e-estao-na-cauda-da-zona-euro_1352732|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 June 2011|title=Portugueses perderam poder de compra entre 2005 e 2007 e estão na cauda da Zona Euro|publisher=Público|language=Portuguese|publication-date=11 December 2008|accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some former state-owned entities are managed by state-run [[holding company]] [[Parpública]], which is a [[shareholder]] of several public and private companies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Among former state-owned companies recently privatised are: [[CTT Correios de Portugal, S.A.|CTT]] (postal service), [[TAP Portugal]] (airline) and [[ANA Aeroportos de Portugal|ANA]] (airports).

Companies listed on [[Euronext Lisbon]] [[stock exchange]] like [[Energias de Portugal|EDP]], [[Galp Energia|Galp]], [[Jerónimo Martins]], [[Mota-Engil]], [[Novabase]], [[Semapa]], [[Portucel Soporcel]], [[Portugal Telecom]] and [[Sonae]], are amongst the largest corporations of Portugal by number of employees, [[net income]] or international [[market share]].

The [[PSI-20]] is Portugal's most selective and widely known [[stock index]].

The [[International Monetary Fund]] issued an update report on the economy of Portugal in late-June 2017 with a strong near-term outlook and an increase in investments and exports over previous years. Because of a surplus in 2016, the country was no longer bound by the Excessive Deficit Procedure which had been implemented during an earlier financial crisis. The banking system was more stable, although there were still non-performing loans and corporate debt. The IMF recommended working on solving these problems for Portugal to be able to attract more private investment. "Sustained strong growth, together with continued public debt reduction, would reduce vulnerabilities arising from high indebtedness, particularly when monetary accommodation is reduced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2017/06/29/mcs6292017-portugal-staff-concluding-statement-of-the-2017-article-iv-mission|title=Portugal: Staff Concluding Statement of the 2017 Article IV Mission|website=Imf.org|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agriculture in Portugal]] is based on small to medium-sized family-owned dispersed units. However, the sector also includes larger scale [[intensive farming]] export-oriented [[agrobusiness]]es backed by companies (like [[Grupo RAR]]'s [[Vitacress]], [[Sovena]], [[Lactogal]], [[Vale da Rosa]], [[Companhia das Lezírias]] and [[Valouro]]). The country produces a wide variety of crops and livestock products, including: [[tomato]]es, [[citrus]], [[green vegetables]], [[rice]], [[corn]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[olive]]s, [[oilseed]]s, [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[Cherry|cherries]], [[bilberry]], [[table grapes]], [[edible mushroom]]s, [[dairy products]], [[poultry]] and [[beef]].

[[Forestry]] has also played an important economic role among the rural communities and industry (namely [[paper industry]] that includes [[Portucel Soporcel Group]], [[engineered wood]] that includes [[Sonae Indústria]], and [[furniture]] that includes several manufacturing plants in and around [[Paços de Ferreira]], the core of Portugal's major industrial operations of [[IKEA]]). In 2001, the gross agricultural product accounted for 4% of the national GDP.

Traditionally a sea-power, Portugal has had a strong tradition in [[Fishing in Portugal|the Portuguese fishing sector]] and is one of the countries with the highest fish consumption per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Pessoa, M.F. |author2=Mendes, B. |author3=Oliveria, J.S. |url = https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st1/fus/fus99/per_capita99.pdf|title= Per Capita Consumption |language = English|quote = Annual per capita consumption of fish and shellfish for human food.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main landing sites in Portugal (including Azores and Madeira), according to total landings in weight by year, are the harbours of [[Matosinhos]], [[Peniche, Portugal|Peniche]], [[Olhão]], [[Sesimbra]], [[Figueira da Foz]], [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]], [[Portimão]] and [[Madeira]]. Portuguese-processed fish products are exported through several companies, under a number of different brands and registered trademarks, such as [[Conservas Ramirez|Ramirez]], the world’s oldest active canned fish producer.

Portugal is a significant European [[minerals]] producer and is ranked among Europe's leading [[copper]] producers. The nation is also a notable producer of [[tin]], [[tungsten]] and [[uranium]]. However, the country lacks the potential to conduct [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and [[aluminium]], a limitation that has hindered the development of Portugal's [[Mining in Portugal|mining]] and [[metallurgy]] sectors. Although the country has vast iron and coal reserves – mainly in the north – after the 1974 revolution and the consequent [[economic globalization]], low competitiveness forced a decrease in the extraction activity for these minerals. The [[Panasqueira]] and [[Neves-Corvo mine]]s are among the most recognised Portuguese mines that are still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://visao.sapo.pt/actualidade/economia/2017-09-12-Guia-para-perceber-o-negocio-das-minas-em-Portugal|title=Guia para perceber o negócio das minas em Portugal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal is rich in its [[lithium]] subsoil, which is especially concentrated in the districts of [[Guarda District|Guarda]], [[Viseu]], [[Vila Real]] and [[Viana do Castelo]], while most of the country’s lithium comes from the Gonçalo aplite-pegmatite field. The largest [[lithium]] mine in Europe is operated by Grupo Mota, Felmica, in the Guarda region, which is estimated to have reserves for 30 years of production. It has 5 more deposits in its possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lithium.today/lithium-supply-by-countries/lithium-supply-portugal/|title=Lithium supply in Portugal |website=lithium.today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/268790/countries-with-the-largest-lithium-reserves-worldwide/|title=Lithium reserves worldwide top countries 2017 |website=Statista}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/energy-investing/lithium-investing/lithium-reserves-country/|title=Lithium Reserves by Country |website=investingnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savannah Resources on May 2018 announced a 52 per cent increase in the estimated lithium resources at the Mina do Barroso Lithium Project in northern Portugal, saying the country could become the first European supplier of [[spodumene]], a lithium-bearing mineral. The company said the estimated mineral resources at the mine now stood at 14 million tonnes. Lithium prices have risen in expectation of growing demand for the mineral, which is used in batteries for electric vehicles and for storing electricity from the power grid. Europe consumes more than 20 per cent of the global supply of battery-grade lithium but currently has to import all its supplies of the mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b58c9286-4df4-11e8-97e4-13afc22d86d4|title=Try FT for free|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W Resources stated in 2018 that it had started a new drilling campaign at its São Martinho [[gold]] project in Portugal. The so-called reverse circulation drilling program included 15 holes with around 2,000 metres of total drilling. The objective is to extend resources by integrating the data from 2016 drilling results with the expansion expected with the ongoing campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sharesmagazine.co.uk/news/market/5954349/W-Resources-starts-new-gold-drilling-campaign-in-Portugal|title=W Resources starts new gold drilling campaign in Portugal|date=1 May 2018 |website=www.sharesmagazine.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/196120/w-resources-kicks-off-new-resource-drilling-at-so-martinho-gold-project-196120.html|title=W Resources kicks off new resource drilling at São Martinho gold project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5k_RgJPKCw|title=W Resources begins new resource drilling at São Martinho in Portugal|first=|last=Proactive Investors Stocktube|date=1 May 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banking and insurance sectors performed well until the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|late-2000s financial crisis]], and this partly reflected a rapid deepening of the market in Portugal. While sensitive to various types of market and underwriting [[risk]]s, it has been estimated that overall both the life and non-life sectors will be able to withstand a number of severe shocks, even though the impact on individual insurers varies widely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2006/cr06378.pdf Portugal: Financial System Stability Assessment, including Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes on the following topics: Banking Supervision, Securities Regulation, and Insurance Regulation], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Science and technology in Portugal}}
Scientific and technological research activities in Portugal are mainly conducted within a network of [[R&amp;D]] units belonging to [[list of universities in Portugal|public universities]] and state-managed autonomous research institutions like the [[Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inovação|INETI&amp;nbsp;– Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inovação]] and the [[Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biológicos|INRB&amp;nbsp;– Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biológicos]]. The funding and management of this research system is mainly conducted under the authority of the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education]] (MCTES) itself and the MCTES's [[Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia]] (FCT).

The largest R&amp;D units of the public universities by volume of research grants and peer-reviewed publications, include [[biosciences]] research institutions like the [[Instituto de Medicina Molecular]], the [[Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology]], the [[IPATIMUP]], the [[Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular]] and the [[Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute]].

Among the largest non-state-run research institutions in Portugal are the [[Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência]] and the [[Champalimaud Foundation]], a neuroscience and oncology research centre, which in addition awards every year one of the highest monetary prizes of any science prize in the world. A number of both national and multinational high-tech and industrial companies, are also responsible for research and development projects. One of the oldest learned societies of Portugal is the [[Sciences Academy of Lisbon]], founded in 1779.

[[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] bilateral state-supported research efforts include the [[International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory]] and the [[Ibercivis]] [[distributed computing]] platform, which are joint research programmes of both Portugal and Spain. Portugal is a member of several pan-European scientific organizations. These include the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[European Laboratory for Particle Physics]] (CERN), [[ITER]], and the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO).

Portugal has the largest [[aquarium]] in Europe, the [[Lisbon Oceanarium]], and the Portuguese have several other notable organizations focused on science-related exhibits and divulgation, like the state agency ''Ciência Viva'', a programme of the Portuguese Ministry of Science and Technology to the promotion of a scientific and technological culture among the Portuguese population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cienciaviva.pt/cienciaviva/index.asp?accao=changelang&amp;lang=en |title=Ciência Viva |publisher=Cienciaviva.pt |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Science Museum of the University of Coimbra]], the [[List of natural history museums#Portugal|National Museum of Natural History]] at the University of Lisbon, and the [[Visionarium (Portugal)|Visionarium]].
With the emergence and growth of several [[science park]]s throughout the world that helped create many thousands of scientific, technological and knowledge-based businesses, Portugal started to develop several&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecparques.pt/associados.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428203838/http://www.tecparques.pt/associados.htm |archivedate=28 April 2011 |title=Tecparques&amp;nbsp;– Associação Portuguesa de Parques de Ciência e Tecnologia |publisher=Tecparques.pt |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; science parks across the country.

By the early-1970s, Portugal's [[Economic history of Portugal|fast economic growth]] with increasing [[mass consumption|consumption]] and purchase of new automobiles set the priority for improvements in transportation. Again in the 1990s, after joining the [[European Economic Community]], the country built many new motorways. Today, the country has a {{convert|68732|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} road network, of which almost {{convert|3000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} are part of system of 44 motorways. Opened in 1944, the first motorway (which linked Lisbon to the National Stadium) was an innovative project that made Portugal among one of the first countries in the world to establish a motorway (this roadway eventually became the Lisbon-Cascais highway, or A5).

Although a few other tracts were created (around 1960 and 1970), it was only after the beginning of the 1980s that large-scale motorway construction was implemented. In 1972, [[BRISA Auto-estradas de Portugal S.A.|Brisa]], the highway concessionaire, was founded to handle the management of many of the region's motorways. On many highways, a toll needs to be paid, see [[Via Verde]]. [[Vasco da Gama bridge]] is the longest bridge in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listafterlist.com/tabid/57/listid/7961/Travel++Places/Top+10+Longest+Bridges+in+the+World.aspx|title=ListAfterList.com|publisher=ListAfterList.com|accessdate=22 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502013507/http://www.listafterlist.com/tabid/57/listid/7961/Travel++Places/Top+10+Longest+Bridges+in+the+World.aspx|archivedate=2 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curiousread.com/2008/02/ten-longest-bridges-in-world.html |title=Curious?

[[Continental Portugal]]'s {{convert|89015|km2|0|abbr=on}} territory is serviced by four international airports located near the principal cities of [[Lisbon]], [[Porto]], [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] and [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]]. Lisbon's geographical position makes it a stopover for many foreign airlines at several airports within the country. The primary [[flag-carrier]] is [[TAP Air Portugal]], although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without the country. The government decided to build a new airport outside Lisbon, in [[Alcochete]], to replace [[Lisbon Portela Airport]], though this plan has been suspended due to austerity measures. Currently, the most important airports are in [[Portela Airport|Lisbon]], [[Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport|Porto]], [[Faro Airport|Faro]], [[Madeira Airport|Funchal]] (Madeira), and [[João Paulo II Airport|Ponta Delgada]] (Azores), managed by the national airport authority group [[ANA&amp;nbsp;– Aeroportos de Portugal]]. One other important airport is the Aeroporto Internacional das Lajes on the island of Terceira in the Azores. This airport serves as one of two international airports serving countries outside the European Union for all nine islands of the Azores. It also serves as a military air base for the United States Air Force. The base remains in use to the present day.

A national railway system that extends throughout the country and into Spain, is supported and administered by [[Comboios de Portugal]]. [[Rail transport]] of passengers and goods is derived using the {{convert|2791|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of railway lines currently in service, of which {{convert|1430|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} are electrified and about {{convert|900|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} allow train speeds greater than {{convert|120|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The railway network is managed by the [[Rede Ferroviária Nacional|REFER]] while the transport of passengers and goods are the responsibility of [[Comboios de Portugal]] (CP), both public companies. In 2006, the CP carried 133,000,000 passengers and {{convert|9750000|t|LT ST|sigfig=3|abbr=on|lk=on}} of goods.

The major seaports are located in [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]], [[Lisbon]], [[Leixões]], [[Setúbal]], [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], [[Figueira da Foz]], and [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].

The two largest metropolitan areas have subway systems: [[Lisbon Metro]] and ''Metro Sul do Tejo'' in the [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area]] and [[Porto Metro]] in the [[Porto Metropolitan Area]], each with more than {{convert|35|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of lines. In Portugal, [[Trams in Lisbon|Lisbon tram services]] have been supplied by the ''Companhia de Carris de Ferro de Lisboa'' ([[Carris]]), for over a century. In [[Porto]], [[Trams in Porto|a tram network]], of which only a tourist line on the shores of the [[Douro]] remains, began construction on 12 September 1895 (a first for the [[Iberian Peninsula]]). All major cities and towns have their own local urban transport network, as well as taxi services.

Portugal has considerable resources of wind and river power, the two most cost-effective renewable energy sources. Since the turn of the 21st century, there has been a trend towards the development of a renewable resource industry and reduction of both consumption and use of fossil fuels. In 2006, the world's largest [[solar energy|solar power]] plant at that date, the [[Moura Photovoltaic Power Station]], began operating near [[Moura, Portugal|Moura]], in the south, while the world's first commercial [[wave power]] farm, the [[Aguçadoura Wave Farm]], opened in the [[Norte Region, Portugal|Norte region]] (2008). By the end of 2006, 66% of the country's electrical production was from coal and fuel power plants, while 29% were derived from [[hydroelectric]] dams, and 6% by [[wind energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/stats/electricitydata.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=PT |title=IEA Energy Statistics: Portugal |accessdate=7 April 2009 |publisher=[[International Energy Agency]]|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, renewable energy resources were producing 43% of the nation's consumption of electricity, even as hydroelectric production decreased with severe droughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?section_id=114&amp;id_news=381941 |title=Fontes renováveis originaram 43% da electricidade consumida |work=Diário Digital|author=Staff |date=8 April 2009 |language=Portuguese|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2010, electricity exports had outnumbered imports. In the period between January and May 2010, 70% of the national production of energy came from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.agenciafinanceira.iol.pt/empresas/portugal-agencia-financeira-ren-energia-electricidade/1168567-1728.html |title=Portugal já exportou mais electricidade este ano que em 2009 |work=Agência Financeira |date=8 June 2010 |language=Portuguese |accessdate=8 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619070535/http://www.agenciafinanceira.iol.pt/empresas/portugal-agencia-financeira-ren-energia-electricidade/1168567-1728.html |archivedate=19 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal’s national energy transmission company, [[Redes Energéticas Nacionais]] (REN), uses sophisticated modeling to predict weather, especially wind patterns, and computer programs to calculate energy from the various renewable-energy plants.
Before the solar/wind revolution, Portugal had generated electricity from hydropower plants on its rivers for decades. New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal’s distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity.

The Statistics Portugal ({{lang-pt|INE – [[Instituto Nacional de Estatística]]}}) estimates that, according to the 2011 census, the population was 10,562,178 (of which 52% was female, 48% was male). In 2017 and according to more up-to-date figures, the population decreased to 10,291,027.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This population has been relatively homogeneous for most of its history: a single religion (Roman Catholicism) and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity, namely after the expulsion of the [[Moors]] and [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html |title=Portugal |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of those minorities nevertheless, stayed in Portugal, under the condition that they convert to Catholicism, after which they became known as ''[[Mozarabian|Mouriscos]]'' and ''[[Marranos]]'' or more commonly ''Cristãos Novos'' (New Christians). A small number of the former Jews may have continued to observe rabbinic Judaism in secret over many generations, in the case of the secret [[History of the Jews in Belmonte|Jews of Belmonte]], a small town in the interior; where now people observe the Jewish faith openly. After 1772 the distinction between Old and New Christians was abolished by decree. Some famous Portuguese New Christians were the mathematician [[Pedro Nunes]] and the physician and naturalist [[Garcia de Orta]]. Another interesting demographic feature relates to the Scandinavian expansion towards the West and strong activity in Northern Portugal where it is believed some coastline communities kept Scandinavian ancestry in [[Aveiro District|Aveiro]], [[Porto District|Porto]] and [[Braga District|Braga]] regions.

The most important demographic influence in the modern Portuguese seems to be the oldest one; current interpretation of [[Y-chromosome]] and [[mtDNA]] data suggests that the Portuguese have their origin in [[Paleolithic]] peoples that began arriving to the European continent around 45,000 years ago. All subsequent migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic. Genetic studies show Portuguese populations not to be significantly different from other European populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmc=1852743 | year=2007 | last1=Bauchet | first1=M | last2=McEvoy | first2=B | last3=Pearson | first3=LN | last4=Quillen | first4=EE | last5=Sarkisian | first5=T | last6=Hovhannesyan | first6=K | last7=Deka | first7=R | last8=Bradley | first8=DG | last9=Shriver | first9=MD | title=Measuring European Population Stratification with Microarray Genotype Data | volume=80 | issue=5 | pages=948–956 | journal=American Journal of Human Genetics | doi=10.1086/513477 | pmid=17436249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese people have a preponderancy of Iberian genetics (Iron Age Period)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eupedia.com/europe/autosomal_maps_dodecad.shtml|title=Eupedia Autosomal Maps|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which belong to R1b haplogroup family alongside with [[Brythonic]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--Celtic Britons are distinguished in the next sentence--&gt; [[Alpine states|Alpine]] and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] genetical markers.

Native Portuguese are an [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] ethnic group, whose ancestry is very similar to [[Spaniards]] and have strong ties with fellow [[Atlantic Europe|Atlantic Arc countries]] like Ireland, British Isles, France and Belgium due to maritime trade dated as far back as the Bronze Age. These maritime contacts and the prevalence of R1b haplogroup as the main genetical marker of these countries suggest a common ancestry and cultural proximity. Other maritime contacts with the Mediterranean specially with Greeks and Phoenicians add particular cultural phenotypes in Southern Portugal and Southern Spain ([[Tartessos]] culture) making both Portugal and Spain a bridge between North Western Europe and the Mediterranean but maintaining the Atlantic character.

The total fertility rate (TFR) {{As of|2015|lc=y}} was estimated at 1.52 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|title=CIA World Factbook |website=Cia.gov|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, 52.8% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pordata.pt/en/Portugal/Live+births+outside+of+marriage++with+parents+co+habiting+or+not+(percentage)-620|title=PORDATA –  Live births outside of marriage, with parents co-habiting or not (%) – Portugal|website=Pordata.pt|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like most Western countries, Portugal has to deal with low fertility levels: the country has experienced a [[sub-replacement fertility rate]] since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cefage.uevora.pt/en/producao_cientifica/projectos/projectos_financiados_por_instituicoes_nacionais_de_apoio_a_investigacao/fertility_in_portugal_a_macro_micro_economic_perspective |title=Fertility in Portugal: a Macro/Micro Economic Perspective  |publisher=Cefage.uevora.pt |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of Portuguese society is characterized by an increasing inequality which at present (2015) places the country in the lowest third of the Social Justice Index for the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/de/publikationen/publikation/did/social-justice-in-the-eu-index-report-2015/|title=Social Justice in the EU – Index Report 2015|website=Bertelsmann-stiftung.de|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal’s parliament in 2018 approved a budget plan for 2019 that includes tax breaks for returning emigrants in a bid to lure back those who left during the [[global financial crisis]] that hit the country. The expansionary 2019 budget, backed by a [[left-wing]] majority in parliament, also aims to boost the purchasing power of households while cutting the already low deficit even further. [[Circular migration|Returning emigrants]] will be allowed to declare only half their taxable income for five years if they return, provided they lived abroad for at least three years. The “Return Programme” is to run for two years. Around 500,000 residents left Portugal between 2010 and 2015 in the wake of the global financial crisis. Although some 350,000 have since returned, Lisbon wants to tempt the rest to come home - in a similar scheme to the Irish one&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dfa.ie/global-irish/returning-to-ireland/ Returning to Ireland, Global Irish, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Iveagh House, 80 St Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2, D02 VY53, 01.12.2018]&lt;/ref&gt; - as well as Portugal struggles with the low birth rate and an [[ageing population]].

Portugal's [[Portuguese Empire|colonial history]] has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them [[Portuguese West Africa|Angola]] and [[Portuguese East Africa|Mozambique]] in 1975), turning over the administration of [[Macau]] to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Brazilians]] have Portuguese ancestry),&lt;ref name="diaspora"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/48.htm Portugal&amp;nbsp;– Emigration], Eric Solsten, ed.

An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975.&lt;ref name="diaspora"/&gt;

Since the 1990s, along with a boom in [[construction]], several new waves of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], [[Brazilians|Brazilian]], [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Lusophone Africans]] and other [[Africans]] have settled in the country. [[Romanians|Romanian]], [[Moldovans]], [[Kosovar diaspora|Kosovar]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] have also migrated to the country. Portugal's [[Romani people|Romani]] population is estimated to be at about 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://criasnoticias.wordpress.com/2008/04/06/etnia-cigana-a-mais-discriminada-8-de-abril-dia-internacional-dos-ciganos/Etniacigana.

In addition, a number of [[EU citizen]]s, mostly from the United Kingdom, other northern European or [[Scandinavia|Nordic]] countries, have become permanent residents in the country (with the British community being mostly composed of retired pensioners who live in the Algarve and Madeira).&lt;ref&gt;[http://embaixada-portugal-brasil.blogspot.com/2007/06/brasileiros-so-maior-colnia-estrangeira.html Brasileiros são a maior colónia estrangeira em Portugal] Embaixada de Portugal No Brasil {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106043956/http://embaixada-portugal-brasil.blogspot.com/2007/06/brasileiros-so-maior-colnia-estrangeira.html |date=6 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2011 Census, 81.0% of the Portuguese population is [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf Censo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202023700/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |date=2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has small Protestant, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint]], [[Islam in Portugal|Muslim]], [[Hinduism in Portugal|Hindu]], [[Sikh]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Baha'i]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Spiritism|Spiritist]] communities. Influences from [[African Traditional Religion]] and Chinese Traditional Religion are also felt among many people, particularly in fields related with Traditional Chinese Medicine and African Witch Doctors. Some 6.8% of the population declared themselves to be non-religious, and 8.3% did not give any answer about their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://censos.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=CENSOS&amp;xpgid=ine_censos_indicador&amp;contexto=ind&amp;indOcorrCod=0006396&amp;selTab=tab10 |title=Instituto Nacional de Estatistica, Censos 2011 |publisher=Censos.ine.pt |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Portuguese holidays, festivals and traditions have a Christian origin or connotation. Although relations between the Portuguese state and the Roman Catholic Church were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation, their relative power fluctuated. In the [[History of Portugal (1279-1415)|13th and 14th centuries]], the church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the [[Reconquista|reconquest]], its close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the Portuguese educational system, including its [[University of Coimbra|first university]].

The growth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese overseas empire]] made its [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]] important agents of [[colonization]], with important roles in the [[Teaching|education]] and [[evangelization]] of people from all the inhabited continents. The growth of [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|liberal]] and nascent [[Republicanism|republican]] movements during the eras leading to the formation of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] (1910–26) changed the role and importance of organized religion.

Portugal is a [[secular state]]: [[Separation of church and state|church and state were formally separated]] during the Portuguese First Republic, and later reiterated in the 1976 [[Portuguese Constitution]]. Other than the Constitution, the two most important documents relating to [[religious freedom]] in Portugal are the 1940 Concordata (later amended in 1971) between Portugal and the [[Holy See]] and the 2001 Religious Freedom Act.

Portuguese is the official language of Portugal. Portuguese is a [[Romance language]] that originated in what is now [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Northern Portugal]], originating from [[Galician-Portuguese]], which was the common language of the Galician and Portuguese people until the formation of Portugal. There are still many similarities between the Galician culture and the Portuguese culture. Galicia is a consultative observer of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]]. 

The Portuguese language is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] spoken by the [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula]] around 2000 years ago – particularly the [[Celts]], [[Tartessians]], [[Lusitanians]] and [[Iberians]]. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the language spread worldwide as Portugal established a colonial and commercial empire between 1415 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portugueselanguage.net/portuguese/history.asp|title=History of the Portuguese|work=portugueselanguage.net|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Portuguese is spoken as a native language in five different continents, with Brazil accounting for the largest number of native Portuguese speakers of any country (209,5 million speakers in 2016).,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Portuguese is the third most used language on Facebook – Socialbakers|url=http://portuguese-american-journal.com/report-portuguese-is-the-third-most-used-language-on-facebook-socialbakers/|work=Portuguese American Journal|publisher=Portuguese American Journal|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/brazil-population/|title=Brazil Population (2017) |website=worldpopulationreview.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the Portuguese language is the official language spoken in Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, and [[East Timor]]. These countries, plus [[Macau]] Special Administrative Region (People's Republic of China) where Portuguese is co-official with [[Cantonese]], make up the [[Lusosphere]], a term derived from the ancient [[Roman province]] of "[[Lusitania]]", which currently matches the Portuguese territory south of the [[Douro]] river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:id=lusitania-geo|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854), Labanae Aquae´NIA|work=tufts.edu|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] is also recognized as a co-official regional language in some municipalities of North-Eastern Portugal. An estimate of between 6,000 and 7,000 Mirandese speakers has been documented for Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://languagesindanger.eu/book-of-knowledge/list-of-languages/|title=List of Languages|work=languagesindanger.eu|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The educational system is divided into preschool (for those under age 6), basic education (9 years, in three stages, compulsory), secondary education (3 years, compulsory since 2010), and higher education (subdivided in university and [[polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]] education). Universities are usually organized into [[faculty (division)|faculties]]. Institutes and schools are also common designations for autonomous subdivisions of [[list of colleges and universities in Portugal|Portuguese higher education institutions]].

The total adult literacy rate is 99 percent. Portuguese primary school enrollments are 100 percent.

According to the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) 2015, the average Portuguese 15-year-old student, when rated in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge, is placed significantly above the [[OECD]]'s average, at a similar level as those students from Norway, Poland, Denmark and Belgium, with 501 points (493 is the average). The PISA results of the Portuguese students have been continuously improving, overcoming a number of other highly developed western countries like the USA, Austria, France and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://visao.sapo.pt/actualidade/sociedade/2016-12-06-Testes-PISA-Portugal-supera-media-da-OCDE|title =  Testes PISA: Portugal supera média da OCDE|publisher=[[Visão]]|language = Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://expresso.sapo.pt/sociedade/2016-12-06-E-agora-no-PISA-alunos-portugueses-melhoram-a-ciencias-leitura-e-matematica

About 40% of college-age citizens (20 years old) attend one of Portugal's higher education institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/GC18/Governo/Ministerios/MCTES/Intervencoes/Pages/20100111_MCTES_Int_Contrato_Confianca_EnsSup.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724173015/http://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/GC18/Governo/Ministerios/MCTES/Intervencoes/Pages/20100111_MCTES_Int_Contrato_Confianca_EnsSup.aspx |archivedate=24 July 2011 |title=Um Contrato de confiança no Ensino Superior para o futuro de Portugal |publisher=[[Government of Portugal]], Portugal.gov.pt |language=Portuguese |date=11 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnedu.pt/content/noticias/CNE/ensino_superior.pdf|format=PDF|title=Ensino Superior|website=Cnedu.pt|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compared with 50% in the United States and 35% in the OECD countries). In addition to being a destination for [[international student]]s, Portugal is also among the top places of origin for international students. All higher education students, both domestic and international, totaled 380,937 in 2005.

Portuguese universities have existed since 1290. The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]] was first established in Lisbon before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the [[Americas]] (the ''[[Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortificação e Desenho]]'' of [[Rio de Janeiro]]) in 1792, as well as the oldest medical college in Asia (the ''[[Escola Médico-Cirúrgica de Goa|Escola Médico-Cirúrgica]]'' of [[Goa]]) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the [[University of Lisbon]].

The [[Bologna process]] has been adopted, since 2006, by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), [[international students]], foreign students from the [[Lusosphere]], degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions ([[Transfer admissions in the United States|academic transfer]]), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.

Most student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part-time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).

Portugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions]] to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.

According to the latest [[Human Development Report]], the average [[life expectancy]] in 2015 was 81.3 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by life expectancy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal ranks 12th in the best public health systems in the world, ahead of high developed countries like the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]] or [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[[World Health Organization ranking of health systems in 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countryeconomy.com/demography/life-expectancy/portugal|title=Portugal – Life expectancy at birth 2015|website=Countryeconomy.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese health system is characterized by three coexisting systems: the National Health Service (''Serviço Nacional de Saúde'', SNS), special social health insurance schemes for certain professions (health subsystems) and voluntary private health insurance. The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 25% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and another 7% by mutual funds.

The Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS.
Five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care.

The SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.

Similar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with [[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%). Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cancer of the cervix and the prostate are more frequent.
Portugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.

Portugal's [[infant mortality rate]] has dropped sharply since the late 1970s, when 24 of 1000 newborns died in the first year of life. It is now around 2 deaths per a 1000 newborns. This improvement was mainly due to the decrease in neonatal mortality, from 15.5 to 2.4 per 1000 live births.

People are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations. Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at the household level complement other data on health status and the use of services.

Only one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |title=Highlights on health in Portugal 2004 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201122536/http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2009 |df= }}.

Portugal has developed a specific culture while being influenced by various civilizations that have crossed the Mediterranean and the European continent, or were introduced when it played an active role during the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Age of Discovery]]. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), Portugal modernized its public cultural facilities, in addition to the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] established in 1956 in Lisbon.

These include the [[Belém Cultural Centre]] in Lisbon, [[Serralves Foundation]] and the [[Casa da Música]], both in [[Porto]], as well as new public cultural facilities like municipal libraries and concert halls that were built or renovated in many municipalities across the country.

Portuguese literature, one of the earliest Western literatures, developed through text as well as song. Until 1350, the [[Portuguese-Galician]] [[troubadour]]s spread their literary influence to most of the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;''Poesia e Prosa Medievais'', p. 9, para. 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gil Vicente]] (c. 1465–c. 1536) was one of the founders of Portuguese dramatic traditions.

Adventurer and poet [[Luís de Camões]] (c. 1524–1580) wrote the epic poem ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' (''The Lusiads''), with [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' as his main influence.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11198/ |title = The Lusiads |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1800–1882 |accessdate = 31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Portuguese poetry is rooted in neoclassic and contemporary styles, as exemplified by [[Fernando Pessoa]] (1888–1935).

[https://www.academia.edu/15680102/The_fable_of_the_cod_and_the_promised_sea._About_portuguese_traditions_of_bacalhau PDF version]&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than enough ''[[bacalhau]]'' dishes; over one for each day of the year. Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]], a potato-based [[stew]] that can be made from several types of fish. Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of beef, pork, lamb, or chicken include ''[[cozido à portuguesa]]'', ''[[feijoada]]'', ''[[frango de churrasco]]'', ''leitão'' (roast [[suckling pig]]) and ''[[carne de porco à alentejana]]''. A very popular northern dish is the arroz de sarrabulho (rice stewed in pigs blood) or the arroz de cabidela (rice and chickens meat stewed in chickens blood).
[[File:Rabelo_Douro_en%E2%80%93Porto.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Portuguese wine]] is well-known, such as [[Port wine]] (being transported here into [[Porto]]).]] 
Typical fast food dishes include the [[Francesinha]] (Frenchie) from Porto, "Tripas à moda do Porto" which is also a traditional plate from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork) or ''prego'' (grilled beef) [[sandwich]]es, which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in the many [[medieval]] Catholic monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which [[pastéis de Belém]] (or ''pastéis de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and ''[[ovos moles]]'' from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small ''tasquinhas''.

Portuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do Dão]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]], and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Setúbal]] and [[Favaios]]. Port and Madeira are particularly appreciated in a wide range of places around the world.

{{Main|Music of Portugal}}
[[File:Jose malhoa fado.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Fado]], depicted in this famous painting (c. 1910) by [[José Malhoa]], is Portugal's traditional music.]]

The traditional one is the Portuguese folk music which has deep roots in local costumes having as instruments bagpipes, drums, flutes, tambourines, accordions and small guitars (''cavaquinho''). Apart Portuguese folk music other renowned genre is [[Fado]], a melancholic urban music originated in [[Lisbon]] in the 19th century, probably inside bohemian environments, usually associated with the [[Portuguese guitar]] and ''saudade'', or longing. [[Coimbra fado]], a unique type of "[[troubadour]] serenading" fado, is also noteworthy. Internationally notable performers include [[Amália Rodrigues]], [[Carlos Paredes]], [[José Afonso]], [[Mariza]], [[Carlos do Carmo]], [[António Chainho]], [[Mísia]], and [[Madredeus]].

In the classical music domain, Portugal is represented by names as the pianists [[Artur Pizarro]], [[Maria João Pires]], [[Sequeira Costa]], the violinists Carlos Damas, [[Gerardo Ribeiro]] and in the past by the great cellist [[Guilhermina Suggia]]. Notable composers include [[José Vianna da Motta]], [[Carlos Seixas]], [[João Domingos Bomtempo]], [[João de Sousa Carvalho]], [[Luís de Freitas Branco]] and his student [[Joly Braga Santos]], [[Fernando Lopes-Graça]], [[Emmanuel Nunes]] and [[Sérgio Azevedo]]. Similarly, contemporary composers such as Nuno Malo and Miguel d'Oliveira have achieved some international success writing.

Portugal has a [[List of Portuguese artists|rich history in painting]]. The first well-known painters date back to the 15th century&amp;nbsp;– like [[Nuno Gonçalves]]&amp;nbsp;– were part of the late Gothic painting period. During the renaissance Portuguese painting was highly influenced by north European painting. In the Barroque period Joana d'Obidos and Vieira Lusitano were the most prolific painters.
[[José Malhoa]], known for his work ''Fado'', and [[Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro]] (who painted the portraits of [[Teófilo Braga]] and [[Antero de Quental]]) were both references in [[Naturalist school of painting|naturalist painting]].

The 20th century saw the arrival of [[Modernism]], and along with it came the most prominent Portuguese painters: [[Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso]], who was heavily influenced by French painters, particularly the Delaunays ([[Robert Delaunay|Robert]] and [[Sonia Delaunay|Sonia]]). Among his best-known works is ''Canção Popular a Russa e o Fígaro''. Another great modernist painters/writers were [[Carlos Botelho]] and [[Almada Negreiros]], friend to the poet [[Fernando Pessoa]], who painted his (Pessoa's) portrait. He was deeply influenced by both [[Cubist]] and [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] trends.

Prominent international figures in visual arts nowadays include painters [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Júlio Pomar]], Helena Almeida, [[Joana Vasconcelos]], [[Julião Sarmento]] and [[Paula Rego]].

'''Protective tariffs''' are [[tariff]]s that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic [[industry]].&lt;ref&gt;"Protective tariff" Collins English Dictionary-Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise [[government revenue]], or to reduce an undesirable activity ([[sin tax]]). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims.

==How tariffs work==
[[File:Tariff Rates in Japan (1870-1960).gif|thumb|Tariff Rates in Japan (1870–1960)]]
[[File:Tariff Rates in Spain and Italy (1860-1910).gif|thumb|Tariff Rates in Spain and Italy (1860–1910)]]
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that are intended to increase the cost of a [[foreign import]] so it is less competitive against a roughly equivalent [[domestic trade|domestic good]].&lt;ref&gt;Bianco, "Trade Barriers." ''Reference for Business''.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if similar cloth for sale in America cost $4 in for a version imported from Britain (including additional shipping, etc.) and $4 for a version originating in the United States, the American government may wish to impose a protective tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Van Duyne, "How a Protective Tariff Works."&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

This political issue relies with the [[purchasing power parity]] between the currencies of countries involved, and also with the parallel [[currency substitution]] in the domestic countries.

==History==

===United States===
[[File:Droits de douane (France, UK, US).png|thumb|Tariff Rates (France, UK, US)]]
[[File:Average Tariff Rates in USA (1821-2016).png|thumb|Average Tariff Rates in USA (1821–2016)]]
[[File:U.S. Trade Balance (1895–2015) and Trade Policies.png|thumb|U.S. Trade Balance (1895–2015) and Trade Policy]]
[[Alexander Hamilton]] was the first American to propose the use of protective tariffs to promote industrialization in his "Report on Manufactures." Hamilton thought that a tariff on textile imports would subsidize American efforts to establish manufacturing facilities to eventually compete with those of the British.&lt;ref&gt;"Protective Tariffs." ''Boundless Open Textbook.''&lt;/ref&gt; Heeding Hamilton's advice, president [[George Washington]] signed the Tariff Act of 1790 into law, as America's second piece of legislation. He stated tariffs were necessary for national security reasons:&lt;blockquote&gt;''A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29431|title=George Washington: First Annual Message to Congress on the State of the Union|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After the [[War of 1812]], cheap British products flooded the American market, which undercut and threatened the infantile industry of the United States. Congress set a tariff in 1816 in order to prevent some of these British goods from entering the United States, followed by another in 1824 and culminating with the controversial [[Tariff of Abominations]] in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, "Definition of Tariff of Abominations." ''About.com.''&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[John Quincy Adams]] approved the Tariff of Abominations after it received a majority vote in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. This 1828 tariff's goal was to protect Northern and Western agricultural products from foreign competition, but in doing so sparked a national debate over the constitutionality of placing tariffs on imports without the intent to merely raise duty revenue.&lt;ref&gt;"The Tariff of Abominations." ''History, Art &amp; Archives, U.S. House of Representatives''.&lt;/ref&gt; The earmarked items in this case included iron, molasses, distilled spirits, flax, and other finished goods. Opposition to this tariff came predominantly from the South since this region lacked a manufacturing sector, leaving it dependent on the North and foreign trade to supply its manufactures. In addition to artificially elevating import costs, the so-called "Tariff of Abominations" afflicted the South by hampering its cotton trade to England, the region's primary source of income.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, "Definition of Tariff of Abominations." ''About.com.''&lt;/ref&gt; This 1828 tariff was so unpopular that it played a significant role in the failure of John Quincy Adams' reelection bid in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;History, Art &amp; Archives, U.S. House of Representatives."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Confederate States====
The [[Confederate Constitution]] prohibited protective tariffs but allowed tariffs for providing domestic revenue.

==Current use==
In present day, the [[International Trade Commission]] reports over 12,000 specific tariffs on imports to the United States, including those on agricultural, textile, and manufactured items. Tobacco has a 350% tariff duty; unshelled peanuts have a 163.8% duty; European meats, truffles, and Roquefort cheese are tacked with a 100% tariff rate. Domestic sectors for these same products depend on tariffs in order to survive; without these elevated costs of competition, American goods would simply cost more than their foreign alternatives and would suffer in the eyes of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Lubin, "25 American Products That Rely on Huge Protective Tariffs To Survive." ''Business Insider'', Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Taipei''' ({{lang-la|Archidioecesis Taipehensis}}) is a [[diocese]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Taiwan]]. [[Pope Pius XII]] erected it as the '''[[Apostolic prefect|Apostolic Prefecture]] of Taipei''' on 30 December 1949.  On 7 August 1952, it was elevated to an [[archdiocese]], with the [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kiayi|Chiayi]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hsinchu|Hsinchu]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hwalien|Hualien]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Taichung|Taichung]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tainan|Tainan]].

The archdiocese's [[cathedral]] is the [[Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Taipei)|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]]. As the only metropolitan in Taiwan, it is the principal [[episcopal see]] of that country. [[John Hung Shan-Chuan]] was appointed Archbishop of Taipei by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on 9 November 2007.

He lives with his dad, mom, and cousin. Along its 10 years show, the main characters [[unageing|never grew up]] and was "stuck" in the third grade.  His best friends are [[Usro]] and [[Ucrit]], while his (sometime) enemies are [[Endut]] and [[Cuplis]].

In April 1981, ''Si Unyil'' appeared for the first time on the television screen.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web|work=UNICEF: Puppets with a purpose |title=Unyil: The puppet that won the hearts of Indonesian children |publisher=[[UNICEF]] |accessdate=2007-07-10 |author=Suyadi |url=http://www.unicef.org/puppets/pupindo.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217202617/http://www.unicef.org/puppets/pupindo.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within short time, the show that was broadcast by the only Indonesian television company at that time and state-owned [[TVRI]], became a close friend to Indonesian children. Although it was meant to entertain children, the story of ''Si Unyil'' contained hidden messages of [[patriotism]], [[nationalism]], [[health]], environment, armed forces, [[family planning]], art and culture. There were, of course, children fantasy, such as folk stories, [[fables]] and [[fairy tale]]s.

All characters in the ''Si Unyil'' are [[hand puppet]]s with the physical appearances of ordinary Indonesian faces. Traditional touch is strongly apparent in the show, from the suit of every characters to the stories that dealing with everyday life. Characters are divided into "good" and "bad" ones, where a group of three young children (''Unyil'' and his two friends) as good, while three other children as bad boys. Conflicts often arouse between the two groups with the ending always with a message to become a good children.

To enhance the story and to be more entertaining, two antagonistic characters were introduced. They are the short-tempered thick mustached [[Pak Raden]] and the lazy [[Pak Ogah]]. Although the two antagonistic characters were supposed to be unsympathetic ones, they were more popular than other characters. ''Pak Raden'' represents a hard working man with a rugged face and strong [[Javanese people|Javanese]] background who always wears a traditional Javanese suit. The popularity of ''Pak Raden'' came when he became funny and was wrong all the time despite of that he insisted strongly at the beginning that he was right. ''Pak Ogah'', on the other hand, represents a lazy person who does not want to work but only to ask money when people asking for his help.  He usually accompanied by his sidekick [[Ableh (character)|Ableh]].

Recently, the show has been revived with a new concept.  It is shown in [[Trans7]], a commercial broadcasting station, as  [[Laptop Si Unyil]] (at Monday to Friday) and "Catatan Harian Si Unyil" (at Saturday and Sunday) which focuses on technology, science, and culture.

'''TVE Internacional''' is a Spanish [[pay television]] channel owned by [[Televisión Española]]. Programming includes a mix of news, discussion-based programmes and drama and documentaries from TVE's [[La 1 (Spanish TV channel)|La 1]] and [[La 2 (Spanish TV channel)|La 2]] Spanish networks. It was launched in December 1989. It broadcasts to [[Latin America]], [[Western Sahara]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Americas]] and the [[Philippines]], in which most of the Hispanic-speaking people are located.

Several news bulletins are provided during the day, covering a mixed Spanish and International agenda. ''Telediario'' is a bulletin produced for and also broadcast in Spain, [[simulcast]] on the international station. However, editions of ''[[Telediario]] Internacional'' are also produced specially for the channel. A daily showbiz magazine, ''Gente'', is broadcast nightly at 7pm [[GMT]].

TVE, like BBC, doesn't show commercial advertisements. More usually, network breaks between programmes broadcast live in Spain are covered with a clock and short information films about Spain and its [[wildlife]].

==Distribution==
In Europe, it was available free-to-air on [[Eutelsat]] [[Hot Bird]] 13° East until March 2014. Due to economic reasons, it moved its satellite distribution for Europe to [[Astra 19.2°E]] as of January 2014 alongside with [[24 Horas]] and the RTVE radios ([[Radio Nacional (Spanish radio station)|RNE Radio Nacional]], [[Radio Clásica|RNE Radio Clásica]], [[Radio 3 (Spanish radio station)|RNE Radio 3]], [[Ràdio 4|RNE Ràdio 4]], [[Radio 5 (Spanish radio station)|RNE Radio 5]], [[Radio Exterior]]).

The channel can no longer be seen in Britain and Ireland through the [[Sky (UK)|Sky]] television platform on [[Eutelsat 33C]] at 28.5° East. In the Americas, it is available as part of [[RTVE]]'s Digital Package for America on Hispasat 1C (encrypted). In Asia, it is available on [[AsiaSat 2]] at 100.5°&amp;nbsp;E and [[PanAmSat]] 8 at 166°&amp;nbsp;E (both in the clear).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1410">'''The Goodman's Croft''' was a [[superstition]] common in sixteenth-century [[Great Britain]], particularly in [[Scotland]]. It was also known as Halyman's Croft, Goodman's Fauld, Gi'en Rig, Deevil's Craft, Clooties Craft, and the Black Faulie.&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davidson|first1=T.

It was condemned in 1594 by the [[General Assembly of the Reformed Kirk]]. They defined it as ''not labouring ane parcell of ground dedicate to the Devil, under the name of Goodman's Croft.'' The Kirk believed this to be a form of [[Satan worship]], but suggestions have been made that these were more ancient offerings to general 'spirits'.&lt;ref&gt;p.12, ''The Guide to Mysterious Aberdeenshire'', Geoff Holder&lt;/ref&gt; Church forces labored to abolish the practice throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref name="davidson" /&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
Among men who can afford it, the preferred form of marriage appears to be [[polygyny]] with [[matrilocal residence]]. Although possible, the first marriage is formally initiated with the [[grand marriage]] when possible, subsequent unions involve much simpler ceremonies. The result is that a man will establish two or even more households and will alternate residence between them, a reflection, most likely, of the trading origins of the [[Shirazi (ethnic group)|Shirazi]] elite who maintained wives at different trading posts. [[Said Mohamed Djohar]], elected president in 1990, had two wives, one in [[Njazidja]] and the other in [[Nzwani]], an arrangement said to have broadened his appeal to voters. For men, divorce is easy, although by custom a divorced wife retains the family home.

In the [[Comoros]] certain landholdings called [[magnahouli]] are controlled by women and inherited through the female line, apparently in observance of a surviving [[matriarchal]] African tradition.

Despite their lower economic status, '''women in the Comoros''' who are married to farmers or laborers often move about more freely than their counterparts among the social elite, managing market stands or working in the fields. On [[Mwali]], where traditional Islamic values are less dominant, women generally are not as strictly secluded. Women constituted 40.4 percent of the work force in 1990, a figure slightly above average for [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

Girls are somewhat less likely than boys to attend school in the Comoros. The [[World Bank]] estimated in 2010 that 70.6 percent of girls were enrolled in primary schools, whereas 80.5 percent of boys were enrolled. In secondary school, 15 percent of eligible Comoran girls were in attendance, in comparison with about 19 percent of eligible boys.

Although the 1992 constitution recognizes their right to [[suffrage]], as did the 1978 constitution, women otherwise play a limited role in politics in the Comoros. By contrast, in [[Mahoré]] female merchants sparked the movement for continued association with France, and later, for continued separation from the [[Republic of the Comoros]].

The Comoros accepted international aid for [[family planning]] in 1983, but it was considered politically inexpedient to put any plans into effect. According to a 1993 estimate, there were 6.8 births per woman in the Comoros. By contrast, the figure was 6.4 births per woman for the rest of sub-Saharan Africa.

In one of Comoran society's first acknowledgments of women as a discrete interest group, the Abdallah government organized a seminar, "Women, Family, and Development," in 1986. Despite participants' hopes that programs for family planning and female literacy would be announced, conference organizers stressed the role of women in agriculture and family life. Women fared slightly better under the Djohar regime. In February 1990, while still interim president, Djohar created a cabinet-level [[Ministry of Social and Women's Affairs]], and appointed a woman, [[Ahlonkoba Aithnard]], to head it. She lasted until a few weeks after Djohar's election to the presidency in March, when her ministry was reorganized out of existence, along with several others. Another female official, [[Situ Mohamed]], was named to head the second-tier [[Ministry of Population and Women's Affairs]], in August 1991. She lost her position—and the subministry was eliminated—hardly a week later, in one of President Djohar's routine ministerial reshufflings. Djohar made another nod to women in February 1992, when he invited representatives of an interest group, the [[Women's Federation]], to take part in discussions on what would become the constitution of 1992. Women only apparently organized and participated in a large demonstration critical of French support of the Djohar regime in October 1992, following government suppression of a coup attempt.

The '''World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA)''' is the "umbrella" organisation for the world zoo and aquarium community. Its mission is to provide leadership and support for zoos, aquariums, and partner organizations of the world in animal care and welfare, conservation of biodiversity, environmental education and global sustainability.&lt;ref name="waza_about"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taronga"/&gt;

The organisation is based in [[Gland, Switzerland|Gland]], [[Switzerland]].

== History ==
After an earlier International Union of Directors of Zoological Gardens (IUDZG), founded in 1935 at [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], ceased to exist during World War II, a new IUDZG was founded in Rotterdam in 1946 by a group of zoo directors from allied or neutral countries. In 1950 IUDZG became an international organisation member of International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUPN), later [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). The IUDZG adopted a new name, World Zoo Organization, in 1991 and revised its membership rules to include regional zoo associations.&lt;ref name="zoo_future_2005"/&gt; In 2000 IUDZG was renamed as WAZA to reflect a more modern institution working together at a global level, to build cooperative approaches to common needs, to tackle common issues, to share information and knowledge, and represent this community in other international bodies such as the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|World Conservation Union (IUCN)]] or at Conferences of the Parties to global Conventions, such as [[CITES]] (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), CBD ([[Convention on Biological Diversity]]) or CMS ([[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migrating Species]]). Between IUCN and CMS or the secretariat of the [[Ramsar Convention]] on Wetlands, there even exist formal Memoranda of Understanding ([[Memorandum of understanding|MoUs]]).

When a number of regional zoo and aquarium associations were founded in different parts of the world (such as [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|AZA]], [[European Association of Zoos and Aquaria|EAZA]], [[British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums|BIAZA]], PAAZAB, [[Zoo and Aquarium Association|ARAZPA]], AMACZOOA, [[Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums|JAZA]], [[South East Asian Zoos Association|SEAZA]]) the IUDZG had to rethink its structure and functions. A decision for major changes was taken, in particular to shift membership from personal to institutional, to establish formal links with the regional associations, to be more proactive in various respects and to become more conservation oriented.

== Organization ==
Members of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums include leading zoos and aquariums, and regional and national Associations of Zoos and Aquariums as well as some affiliate organizations, such as zoo veterinarians or zoo educators, from all around the world.
Together they are 'United for Conservation'.

WAZA institutional members includes more than 250 zoos and aquaria,&lt;ref name="waza_list"/&gt;  as well as about 25 regional associations.
&lt;ref name="waza_members"/&gt; In addition, about 1300 zoos are linked to WAZA through membership in one of the regional or national association members, and more than 700 million visitors pass through these facilities each year.&lt;ref name="waza_list"/&gt;

All members of the WAZA network are obliged to comply with “WAZA's Code of Ethics and Animal Welfare”, adopted by WAZA in 2003.

==Support for zoos and aquariums of the world==

According to the umbrella organization, there are two characteristics that all the institutions known as ‘zoos’ have in common:
*Zoos possess and manage collections that primarily consist of wild (nondomesticated) animals, of one or more species, that are housed so that they are easier to see and to study than in nature.
*Zoos display at least a portion of this collection to the public for at least a significant part of the year, if not throughout the year.
The definition of "zoo" is a broad one and it may also incorporate [[aquarium]]s, [[game reserve]]s, [[aviary|aviaries]], [[safari park]]s, rescue centers, [[animal sanctuary|sanctuaries]] or even so called "roadside zoos" where animals are often kept in problematic sub-standard conditions.
In the view of the rest of the zoo community, which is committed to the principles of [[animal welfare]] and conservation, these roadside zoos do a lot of damage to the image of zoos in general and should be either assisted to reach a level of minimum standard or be closed down (which raises the problem what should be done with the animals they keep).
Not all of sanctuaries are managed by experienced zoo professionals and staff, being able to deal with a variety of animals with different needs and requirements. Also the keeping conditions sometimes do not meet highest standards and in a number of instances the enclosures reach rather soon their carrying capacity, because it is usually very difficult if not impossible to release the animals into the wild (and also difficult to find suitable and appropriate places in zoos), making it impossible to further accept more animals.
This may give rise to unjustified critique towards zoos in general in particular by some [[animal rights group]]s, which object to the keeping of wild animals (and for that matter also of [[domestic animal]]s and [[pet|companion animals]] in human care). Keeping wild animals in zoos is even seen as human domination over other creatures. On the other hand, objective and science-based critique by the less extreme and recognized [[animal welfare]] organizations is usually well received and may lead to improvements of problematic keeping conditions in specific cases. The "umbrella organisation" worldwide for the world zoo and aquarium community today, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) has a complaint procedure, allowing to follow up on complaints received from the public. 
Among the questions that may be raised are:
* the conditions under which animals are kept, often precipitated by some unusual event such as an escape or an accidental death, and commonly expanded into a challenge of the legitimacy of holding any animals captive;
* euthanasia generally, but particularly as relates to the disposal of genetic surplus or highly sentient individuals;
* the feeding of live prey and, in some cases, whole animal carcasses;
* transfers of individuals between zoos, particularly when social relationships that are believed to have attributes in common with those of humans are ruptured as a result;
* the use of animals in entertainment, especially performing animals;
* bringing new animals in from the wild to augment captive holdings or to start new breeding programs;
* the employment of invasive technologies such as embryo manipulation or exogenous hormonal stimulation in breeding efforts;
* all research involving animals, even when it is the health and longevity of animals that could benefit.

The modern type zoo aims to keep healthy, physically sound animals in natural surroundings, allowing them to behave naturally and normally. What is done in the interests of the animals kept is also done in the interest of the zoo visitors, who can thus observe the animals as if they were in nature.
The aims for the modern zoo are [[education]], [[research]], [[recreation]] and [[nature conservation|conservation]]. In fact modern zoos consider themselves as centers for conservation of [[biodiversity]] through [[captive breeding]] programs ([[ex-situ conservation|"ex-situ" conservation]]) in particular of threatened species as well as various [[in-situ conservation|"in-situ" conservation]] programs, such as [[reintroduction]] and restocking projects, supporting in-situ conservation projects (protection of species and/or their habitat), transfer of knowledge and techniques, in situ educational programs aimed at the local people and at the politicians, biological programs (research and monitoring), [[socioeconomics|socio-economic]] projects, social work among the local people, [[public relations|PR]] activities and much more on a national and international scale. Therefore, some zoos call themselves today "conservation parks" or "bioparks". In the world, zoos more and more see themselves as modern arks for endangered and rare species. Within the concept of the modern ark, even projects of “[[frozen zoo]]s” have been initiated, where [[gamete]]s and [[embryo]]s are stored under deep-freeze conditions in order to preserve them for a very long time. The mission of WAZA is to provide leadership and support for zoos, aquariums, and partner organizations of the world in animal care and welfare, conservation of biodiversity, environmental education and global [[sustainability]].

Indeed, zoos are at present rapidly evolving to serve in multiple ways as conservation centres. Professional capacities of concern and subjects communicated to the public in earlier phases of zoo development are now vital services to conservation. As conservation centres, zoos must additionally address sustainable relationships of humankind and nature, explain the values of ecosystems and the necessity of conserving biological diversity, practice the conservation ethic throughout zoo operations and cooperate within the world zoo network and with other conservation organizations.
In recent years, great emphasis has been placed on creating new and dynamic exhibits at zoos that provide significant enrichment opportunities for the animals on display while also offering visitors a unique viewing and learning experience.
[[Immersion exhibit]]s involve zoo visitors in the environmental circumstances of the animals and such experiences are conductive to favorable reception by visitors of strong conservation messages.

==Conservation==

===Integrated conservation===

Only zoos, [[public aquarium|aquarium]]s and [[botanical garden|botanic garden]]s can operate across the whole spectrum of conservation activities, from ex situ breeding of threatened species, research, public education, training and influencing and advocacy, through to in situ support of species, populations and their habitats. They uniquely have a massive ‘captive audience’ of visitors whose knowledge, understanding, attitude, behaviour and involvement can all be positively influenced and harnessed. They have a huge resource of technical skills and dedicated people. As habitats shrink and collection-managed populations grow, the definition of what is a zoo, what is a botanic garden, what is a reserve, and who is a collection-based conservationist, who is a field-based conservationist, will inevitably blur. Indeed, zoos, aquariums and botanic gardens have an opportunity to establish themselves as models of ‘integrated conservation’. In the German speaking part of Europe e.g. 45 zoos have united themselves in the “Foundation species conservation” with the purpose to advertise conservation projects on a large scale.

Today many animal species are threatened with extinction to a great extent because of increasing threats to their natural habitat.
Zoos do not only keep such species in their custody with a view to maintaining ex situ reserve populations, but they increasingly link their [[Ex-situ conservation|ex situ]] activities with conservation projects in the field (“[[In-situ conservation|in situ]]”).

With the human population worldwide constantly increasing together with an ever increase in demand for resources, and destruction of natural habitats, the role of zoos as conservation centres and [[Noah's Ark|ark]]s will become even more important in the coming years, combined with accumulating experience and knowledge on ex-situ and in-situ conservation by the worldwide zoo community, which is increasingly committed to integrated conservation.

===WAZA-branding of ''in situ'' projects===

Members of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the wider WAZA Network undertake or support thousands of ''[[in situ]]'', or combined ''[[ex situ]]''-''in situ'' projects. It is estimated that zoos, aquariums and zoo and aquarium associations jointly expend in excess of 50 million euros per year for such projects. Reintroduction and restocking projects have been undertaken with about 200 species. In addition, in situ activities include now often also educational programmes aimed at the local people and at the politicians, biological programmes (research and monitoring), socio-economic projects, social work among the local people, public relations activities and much more on a national and international scale – all in order to secure the conservation efforts far into the future.

Since these efforts are largely invisible to the general public, in 2003 WAZA started allowing organisations to request and use the WAZA brand on projects executed or supported by the WAZA constituency.&lt;ref&gt;Dick, G. and Gusset, M., [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1748-1090.2009.00101.x/pdf "Building a Future for Wildlife? Evaluating the contribution of the world zoo and aquarium community to in situ conservation"], ''International Zoo Yearbook'', Volume 44, Issue 1, 2010, pp.183-191.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently more than 150 projects around the world are WAZA branded.

===The World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy===

In 1993, The World Zoo Organisation (IUDZG) and the Captive Breeding Specialist Group of The World Conservation Union (IUCN) published The World Zoo Conservation Strategy. That strategy defined, for the first time in a single document, the responsibilities and opportunities that the international zoo and aquarium community needed, in order to be fully involved in nature conservation. The pressures and threats to wildlife remain and have indeed increased. The need for help in conservation has intensified. It is therefore an opportune time for all zoos and aquariums to re-examine the ways and means by which they can consolidate and increase their support and involvement in conservation.
In 2005 a revised, second strategy, “Building a Future for Wildlife: the World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy”, was published by the World Zoo and Aquarium Association (WAZA). This document reinforces and expands the overall themes of the first document and presents a vision of the roles that all zoos and aquariums can and must play in the conservation of wildlife and of their ecosystems. The 72 page document, which is the result of assistance and advice from over 350 people, is truly international in its scope and in its production.
The Strategy is aimed at all zoos and aquariums, however large or small, however rich or poor, and not just those that are members of WAZA. The Strategy provides a common philosophy for zoos and aquariums across the globe and defines the standards and policies that are necessary to achieve their goals in conservation. The 2005 Strategy will be of use and interest not to only zoo and aquarium people but to anyone concerned with biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.
The document begins with a supportive foreword from the Director General of The World Conservation Union (IUCN), and a preface by the President of WAZA and by the Chair of the WAZA Conservation Committee, that set out the genesis and production of the Strategy. The document comprises nine chapters, with each chapter having a summary, a vision statement, a main text, conclusions, and a series of recommendations. 
This Strategy will be used by individual zoos and aquariums, by national and regional associations, and by WAZA itself, as the basis for the development of action plans for the implementation of the recommendations.

The document is available today in English, German and Russian. Bahasa, French, Japanese and Polish versions, as well as Urdu, Hindi, Bengali or Bangla, Dari and Singala summaries are currently under preparation.

In 2009, the World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy (WZACS) was especially implemented for the international aquarium community in the document entitled ''Turning the Tide: A Global Aquarium Strategy for Conservation and Sustainability''.

{{Conservation status}}

===Extinct in the wild - surviving in human care===

According to the current [[IUCN Red List]] (2008), 37 animal species are [[extinct in the wild]]. Zoo-bred animals of several species listed by IUCN as extinct in the wild did survive in zoos and have been reintroduced to parts of their former range in recent years ([[Partula (genus)|''Partula'' species]], [[Père David's deer]] and the [[Scimitar oryx|scimitar-horned oryx]]).

The IUCN list also contains other species which were extinct in the wild in the past but which have survived in human care, and several of them have been reintroduced by zoos and wildlife parks to their original habitat ([[California condor|Californian condor]] [[Critically endangered species|CR]], [[red wolf]] [[Critically endangered species|CR]], [[black-footed ferret]] [[Endangered species|EN]], [[Przewalski's horse]] [[Endangered species|EN]], [[Dama gazelle|mhorr gazelle]] [[Critically endangered species|CR]], [[Arabian oryx]] [[Vulnerable species|VU]],  [[Wisent|European bison]] [[Vulnerable species|VU]], [[American bison]] [[Near Threatened|NT]]).
However the IUCN does not list two species of [[Seychelles giant tortoise]]s which were rediscovered recently surviving in human care.

===International studbooks===

International [[studbook]]s for endangered and rare species are kept under the auspices of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). In most cases, staff of WAZA member institutions serve as studbook keepers. The International Studbook Office is hosted by the [[Zoological Society of London]], and a staff member of the WAZA executive office acts as International Studbook Coordinator. Within WAZA, the Committee on Population Management (CPM) is the body dealing primarily with studbook issues.
As of March 2008, there were 183 international studbooks including all subspecies and species that are kept as separate studbooks. Altogether, there are studbooks (international and regional) and/or breeding programmes for more than 850 different taxa.

===Conservation breeding programs===

Animal collections in individual zoos and aquariums are typically too small to be of much value to long-term conservation. Therefore, cooperative international or regional ''[[ex situ]]'' breeding programmes are required to form large, viable populations. These cooperative breeding programmes serve many purposes: providing animals for public educational and/or exhibit opportunities; providing fund-raising material; providing research collections from which to gain basic knowledge of animal biology and husbandry; and, on a larger scale, providing demographic and genetic backup to wild populations. To serve in all of these roles fully, these populations must be viable over the long term. This requires that they be demographically stable, healthy, well maintained and capable of self-sustaining reproduction, distributed among several institutions to lessen the risks of catastrophic loss, of sufficient size to maintain high levels of genetic diversity.
Conservation breeding programmes (such as the [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP), established 1981, or the [[European Endangered Species Programme]] (EEP), established 1985) are typically organized at the level of the regional associations, in particular [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|AZA]] and [[European Association of Zoos and Aquaria|EAZA]], because the exchange of animals between regions is expensive and - mainly due to veterinary restrictions - difficult. At its 2003 Annual Meeting, however, WAZA adopted a procedure for establishing interregional programmes, which may concern a number of species for which International Studbooks have been established.

Until today only few of the rare, endangered or extinct-in-the-wild species could be saved from complete extinction by keeping and breeding them in human care. But it may be well too early to really evaluate the contribution of zoos breeding programmes to the preservation of biodiversity.

===Relationship with IUCN===

*WAZA provides financial support to [[IUCN Species Survival Commission]] and to its Specialist Groups, such as the South American Camelid Specialist Group.
*WAZA promotes the use of the newly developed [[IUCN Red List]] of Threatened Species branding and many zoos and aquariums have already in 2010 made use of it.
*WAZA has published on December 1, 2009 a book on ‘The Future of Wildlife’ to mark the 2010 [[International Year of Biodiversity]], with contributions from partners including IUCN.
*WAZA supports international endeavours for amphibian conservation and is partnering with IUCN and its [[IUCN Species Survival Commission#Conservation Breeding Specialist Group|Conservation Breeding Specialist Group]] in the ‘[[Amphibian Ark]]’.

===Projects===

WAZA works in partnership with international organisations with a view to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity. 
Two examples of WAZA supported projects on the occasion of the International Year of the Gorilla 2009 are:

'''The Nouabalé - Ndoki Project in Democratic Republic of the Congo''' is supported by the [[Wildlife Conservation Society|WCS]] (USA), [[Toronto Zoo]] (Canada), La [[Palmyre Zoo]] (France), La Vallée des Singes (France), [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] (CARPE program), [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|USFWS]], and [[French Global Environment Facility|FFEM]]. Since the early 90s, WCS aims to help conserve biodiversity in Congo by working with the government, local communities and private sector partners to adopt a landscape scale management approach, establishing and maintaining a network of well-managed protected areas,
including the Nouabalé - Ndoki National Park.

'''Conservation of the [[Cross River gorilla]] in Nigeria''', implemented by Kolmarden Foundation, the [[Great Ape Trust]] of Iowa (Iowa Zoo), [[Columbus Zoo and Aquarium|Columbus Zoo]], Zoo Boise, supported by Wildlife Conservation Society ([[Bronx Zoo]]), Great Ape Conservation Fund (US Fish and Wildlife Service), African Great Apes Programme ([[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]), Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation, Berggorilla and Regenwald Direkthilfe, [[North Carolina Zoo]].
The Cross River gorilla project in Nigeria has four main
components:
*Support for protected area development
*Landscape level conservation action
*Research
*Conservation education

==Education==

Zoos and aquariums appeal to a very broad audience and have huge visitor numbers throughout the world. They enable people to develop appreciation, wonder, respect, understanding, care and concern about nature. They therefore have the potential to be a very important source of environmental awareness, training and action for a sustainable future on a local, national, regional or international scale. In fact they are excellent centres in which to inform people about the natural world and the need for its conservation. Awareness can be converted into action with positive benefits for wildlife, people and conservation.

Living animals have an enormous power of attraction. Seeing, hearing and smelling them has huge educational significance in itself. The primary goal of living exhibits is [[education]] and educators increasingly are involved in the design of the exhibits. Animals are displayed in more natural settings, mixed exhibits and/or exhibits provide contextual story-led or message-driven experiences, using a variety of interpretation techniques. With an increasingly [[urbanization|urbanized]] population, this contact with nature is of vital importance and zoos build on it to promote and support conservation. Visitors will then more easily understand the concepts of [[biodiversity]] and the interdependence of species, [[habitat]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, and recognize the links with human actions.

Zoos and aquariums have recognized that the visitors’ experience is also affected by the welfare of the animals and their enclosures. Zoos therefore ensure that positive educational messages are not compromised or confused by poor conditions or poor [[husbandry]] and that the animals are exhibited in the best conditions possible, in enclosures that enable them to live as naturally as possible and to exhibit natural behaviour as far as possible.

Furthermore, enclosures clearly and correctly identify the animals in them. Signs highlight threatened species and species in regional, national and international coordinated breeding programmes.

A number of activities allow [[informal education]], such as keeper talks, close encounters, hands-on experiences, exhibits that allow visitor access, exhibits with a clear biological theme. Whenever animal demonstrations form part of the programme, they contain an education or conservation message.

Resource material and education information is displayed and made available to the general public and zoo audience. This includes leaflets, guidebooks, teachers’ notes, resource packs and worksheets.

WAZA provides interactive, structured educational [[workshops]], classes, and resources tailored to meet the specific needs of groups, zoos and aquariums and contribute to learning and understanding as part of local and national [[curricula]] frameworks. Many zoos now have an education department, a classroom, and full-time educational officers.

WAZA encourages all of its staff to participate in local, national, regional and international networks such as the [[International Zoo Educators Association]] (IZEA) and its regional groups.

==Research==

Today, through their living collections, zoos and aquariums can make a unique contribution to conservation-directed research. No other network of institutions can provide, as a resource for study, representative populations of so diverse an array of the world’s wildlife. In addition, zoos and aquariums offer a rare venue for researchers and the public to meet and communicate, providing a platform for interpreting the outcome of research and explaining the implications for conservation action.

There are two main divisions of research in zoos and aquariums: (1) research that is aimed at new knowledge to help the institution achieve its goals, and (2) research that is undertaken in a zoo by others to achieve their own goals, without being inconsistent with those of the organization. Under the first division would fall research on husbandry, visitor preferences, educational and interpretation methods, conservation approaches etc., to a greater or lesser extent depending on a zoo’s particular mission. The latter division would include assisting researchers from universities and research organizations by providing access to and or material from non-domesticated species for comparative analyses. 
It is impossible to describe all of the research undertaken by and at zoos and aquariums. Though there are areas of overlap, research can be divided into the following categories: 
* research in pure and applied biological science (including [[small population size|small population]] biology, [[animal welfare]], wildlife medicine, [[physiology]], [[nutrition]], [[behaviour]], reproductive biology, [[genetics]], [[evolution]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]);
* [[in situ conservation]] research (e.g. field-based ecological and habitat research);
* research aimed at identifying and improving zoo and aquarium operations (for example research on visitor learning, the effectiveness of exhibits and programmes, marketing and messaging, membership, and development and fund-raising).

==Recreation==

Although [[recreation]] is today not the main aim of zoos anymore, it is clear that it plays still a very important role. People, especially from urbanized areas are often alienated from nature, have in a zoo the opportunity to relax and to enjoy a naturalistic environment in their very neighborhood. The profound positive influence nature – also in form of plants and [[companion animal]]s – has on the psychic well-being of men, women and children in the very hectic, technical (and often virtual) world today has been demonstrated many times. Zoos make here no exception. They are places without the daily stress of the professional life, usually places of quiet and calmness with profound positive emotional experiences that allow people to immerge into another world – even in the middle of busy cities. This therefore is also one of the many reasons why zoos are visited today by young and old by the millions.

Zoos personnel know that this experience is possible only if visitors have the impression that the animals are healthy and well kept in naturalistic habitat-like enclosures. Therefore, when planning new exhibits today this is taken into consideration.

==Ethic==

===Care of animals===

Within the twentieth century great strides had been made in the development of management methods and of principles and techniques relating to the maintenance of captive populations that increasingly satisfied the physical and psychological needs of the animals.
Together with the increasing practical experiences in modern [[animal husbandry]], various developments in the science of [[veterinary medicine]] (in particular prevention and control of [[parasitism|parasites]] and causes of [[disease]]), enormous technical advances and the accumulation of knowledge of all kinds, it became possible to venture exhibits which before had not seemed possible.
Zoos today provide exhibits of such size, volume, structure and objects as to allow the animals to express their natural behaviours. Also the animals are provided areas to which they may retreat. In addition separate facilities are available to allow separation of animals where necessary, e.g. cubbing dens. Efforts are made to protected animals at all times from conditions detrimental to their well-being.

Proper feeding management of wild animals in zoos and aquariums incorporates both husbandry skills and applied nutritional sciences. As a basic foundation of animal management, nutrition is integral to longevity, disease prevention, growth and reproduction. Additionally food collecting and/or gathering contributes to behavioral enrichment and provides occupation. Quite elaborate systems of food presentation (dead rats) have been developed (e.g. in Switzerland for wild cats), where computer programmed various mechanic devices allow the animals in the enclosure to search for prey as in their natural environment. However, in some cases animals in zoos need to be fed with other live animals, because they would not eat non-living food items. Whenever this has to be done however, the prey should have, as in natural conditions, a possibility to hide and it must be assured that the prey animal is killed as quickly as possible without pain and suffering. Whenever the animals accept dead prey or food items, they are not to be given live animals as food.

Indeed, most contemporary zoos led by professionals are aware of environmental enrichment, also called [[behavioral enrichment]], as a part of the daily care of animals. Environmental enrichment refers to the practice of providing animals with environmental [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. The goal of environmental enrichment is to improve an animal's quality of life by increasing physical activity, stimulating natural behaviors, and preventing or reducing [[stereotypical behaviour]]s.
  
Also the use of behavioral training, as another method of behavioral enrichment, has often contributed to the animals well-being as well as allowed zoos to improve dramatically their ability to care for animals, while reducing animal stress and increasing safety for both keeper and animal during care procedures. It is self-evident that such training must be done by expert keepers in a way that is appropriate to the animals, based on biological and scientifically sound learning principles.

===Management of animals===

At the beginning of the twentieth century, zoos acquired many animals that were caught in the wild. Today however zoos acquire animals much more frequently through their ex-situ breeding programs, trade or exchange (or loans and gifts) among zoos (often following the advice of the appropriate Species Co-ordinators). Zoos make sure that institutions receiving their animals have appropriate facilities to hold them and skilled staff that are capable of maintaining the same high standard of husbandry and welfare as they themselves. However it is recognized that, from time to time, there is a legitimate need for conservation breeding programs, education programs or basic biological studies, to obtain animals from the wild. The collection, trade, and transport of wild animals is strictly regulated today by national and international legislation (in particular [[CITES]], [[IATA]] and [[OIE]]) and is controlled by government agencies. In particular the CITES provisions make sure that such acquisitions will not have a deleterious effect upon the wild population. Various surveys have shown however that the acquisition of wild caught animals (in particular mammals, birds and reptiles) by zoos has decreased significantly in the last years and that zoos increasingly manage to maintain their collections without introduction of animals caught in the wild. Indeed, many species are bred in zoos using sophisticated, and expensive, scientific procedures.

The situation is somewhat different for aquaria, where – although an increasing number of fish and invertebrates can be bred in human care – still newly acquired animals are predominantly wild-caught. One of the reasons is that reproduction in aquaria just has not been possible yet or is – still – too expensive.

In fact the World Zoo Conservation Strategy published in 1993 states "that the commercial wild animal trade as a source of zoo animals should cease as soon as possible. Such animals as must be collected from the wild must be collected for specific educational and conservation purposes. They should not be chosen from dealers’ lists of animals randomly collected for commercial purposes." These goals, while more pertinent in 1993, are still valid and show up again in the World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy published in 2005. Since then, this has meant that zoos disapprove of selling their “surplus” animals to animal dealers, auctions and [[game farm]]s, unaccredited zoos and individuals without the necessary knowledge and expertise, respectively without the keeping-license required by national legislation.

All animals being transferred are usually accompanied today by appropriate records with details of health, diet, reproductive and genetic status and behavioural characteristics having been disclosed at the commencement of negotiations. These records will allow the receiving institution to make appropriate decisions regarding the future management of the animal. All animal transfers must conform to the international standards and laws applying to the particular species. Where appropriate or required by legislation, animals are accompanied by qualified staff.

[[Government agencies]] and animal welfare organizations also contact zoos whenever the need arises to place an animal [[confiscated]] because it has been illegally imported or acquired or has been rescued from unsuitable circumstances and which needs special and expert care and appropriate housing. Zoos usually are cooperative but they also may have to decline to take such animals in their custody when e.g. they do not have appropriate [[quarantine]] facilities, have no appropriate enclosures, fear the risk of [[disease]] when accepting an animal of unknown origin, don’t see any purpose in incorporating an animal of unknown origin into their breeding program or see no way how such an animal could be integrated socially into their group of conspecifics.

In keeping with the requirements of animal welfare standards, the adaptive capacity of wild animals in zoos must not be compromised, nor their functional capabilities allowed to atrophy. Furthermore, animals in zoos must be kept in a manner that accommodates their natural behaviour. Reproductive behaviour is central to this consideration. Reproduction in all its aspects ([[courtship]], [[pair bonding]], nest building, parents-infant bonding, socialization of the young, integrating offspring into the group, influencing the social structure, transfer of knowledge, capabilities and traditions etc.) is indeed a significant part of the animal’s natural behaviour. Impeding [[reproduction]] may cause distress, social disorder, deprivation etc. Therefore, generally speaking, animals should not be prevented from breeding. However whilst this principle is valid for all animal species irrespective of their [[anthropocentric]] emotional value, it is not applicable to each and every individual. In the implementation of this principle, it may be necessary to humanely [[euthanize]] individual animals at times that approximate certain critical events they would encounter in the wild state (e.g. birth, [[weaning]], leaving the family group). In nature animals generally produce surplus offspring and not every individual is actually able to reproduce. In addition to the already mentioned critical phases in the life cycle of an animal, various other factors such as [[emigration]], [[immigration]], disease, [[predation]], [[competition]], [[famine]] and climate regulate population sizes. Reproductive management in zoos should reflect natural circumstances. In regulating the size of their animal stocks and populations zoos thus may pursue the following strategies:
* Relocate surplus to other suitable and appropriate facilities.
* Release to sanctuaries.
* Release into the wild within the framework of coordinated species recovery projects, respecting the [[IUCN]] guidelines and all legal requirements.
* Temporarily impede reproduction in a humane and ethical manner (group management, [[contraception]], [[Animal sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]], [[artificial insemination]] etc.).

When contraception is considered, the possible side effects of both surgical and chemical contraception, as well as the negative impact on behavior and social structure of the group should be considered before the final decision to implement contraception is made.

When all options have been investigated and none of these measures are feasible without causing stress or impacting upon group behaviour and the decision is taken that it is necessary to euthanize an animal, care will be taken to ensure it is carried out in a fear free environment and a manner that ensures a quick death without suffering. Euthanasia may be controlled by local customs and laws but should always be used in preference to keeping an animal alive under conditions which do not allow it to experience an appropriate quality of life. Whenever possible a post-mortem examination should be performed and biological material preserved for research and gene conservation. If [[ethics]] and [[legislation]] allows it, there is nothing wrong with “recycling” remains of such animals into the zoo’s own [[food chain]].

Zoos usually avoid talking about death. In particular, they do not convey that sometimes it may be unavoidable to kill animals with a view of keeping a breeding programme alive and viable.
The largest problem for long-term conservation breeding at zoos will be the lack of understanding by the public that nature is based on surplus, i.e. that always more animals are born than are necessary for maintaining their own species, and that these surplus animals will end up in the food chain, thus ensuring the survival of other species.

==Secretariat==

A permanent Executive Office has been established in October 2001. The Office was located in the centre of [[Berne]], [[Switzerland]] at this time. From May 2010 to September 2018, the WAZA Executive Office was situated in the heart of IUCN’s newly built Conservation Centre in [[Gland, Switzerland]]. The permanent executive office of WAZA is currently located in the city of [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waza.org/en/site/news-events/news/waza-executive-office-relocation|title=WAZA Executive Office Relocation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
