{{United Kingdom in the European Union}}
'''''Brexit: The Movie''''' is a 2016 British [[documentary film]] written and directed by [[Martin Durkin (television director)|Martin Durkin]], advocating for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the [[European Union]], commonly called ''[[Brexit]]'' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''British'' and ''exit''). The film's production was funded through crowdfunding via Kickstarter as well as £50,000 from the hedge fund Spitfire Capital. 

It premiered in London on 11 May 2016, before being released the following day on YouTube and Vimeo.

== Reception ==
''Brexit: The Movie'' received over 1.5 million views on ''YouTube'' by 23 June 2016 (the date of the referendum).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The film's reviews upon release included both praise and [[Film criticism|criticism]].

Paul Baldwin writing for ''[[Daily Express|The Daily Express]]'', a pro Brexit newspaper, called it a "powerful" exposure of the lack of accountability within the European Union.&lt;ref name="Express"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/669367/Brexit-The-Movie-reveals-terrifying-TRUTH-about-anti-democratic-EU|title=Watch: Brexit movie reveals how smug Eurocrats have shot our democracy down in flames|last=Baldwin|first=Paul|date=12 May 2016|work=[[The Daily Express]]|access-date=24 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Dunn-McAfee of the [[Public Relations and Communications Association]] commented that the film was "easily digestible" and "witty" but felt that it was a "little too late and a little too stretched".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prweek.com/article/1394642/brexit-movie-shows-power-simplifying-story|title=Brexit: The Movie shows the power of simplifying the story|last=Dunn-McAfee|first=Nicholas|work=PRWeek|date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Newsweek]]'' noted the film's attempt to market to [[Conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservative]], [[anti-establishment]] audiences, calling it "a [[Libertarianism in the United Kingdom|libertarian's]] wet dream of [[Ayn Rand|Randian]] proportions", and criticising alleged inconsistencies in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Lowe|first=Josh|date=12 May 2016|title=Brexit: The Movie is a Libertarian's Wet Dream|url=http://www.newsweek.com/brexit-movie-review-nigel-farage-michael-gove-douglas-carswell-eu-referendum-459234|magazine=[[Newsweek]]|doi=|pmid=|access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' criticised the film, stating it relied on [[ethnic stereotypes]] and omitted certain perspectives. 

''Huffington'' praised the film's persuasiveness, but indicated that it could also potentially drive voters towards the Remain camp.&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/owen-bennett/brexit-the-movie-_b_9915388.html|title='Brexit – The Movie' Paints a Thatcherite Dream Of Post-EU Britain|last=Bennett|first=Owen|date=12 May 2016|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|access-date=24 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German newspaper ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' criticised the lack of balance in the film as it did not feature a single pro-European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/wirtschaftspolitik/film-brexit-the-movie-soll-waehler-fuer-eu-austritt-gewinnen-14228486.html|title=Brexit - der Film|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=May 12, 2016|last=Theurer|first=Marcus|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''camouflage passport''' is a document, designed to look like a real [[passport]], issued in the name of a non-existent [[country]] or entity. It may be sold with matching documents, such as an [[international driver's license]], club membership card, insurance documents or similar supporting [[identity papers]].&lt;ref&gt;"A precaution in your pocket" by Amon Cohen in ''[[The Financial Times]]'', 25 August 1997, p. 10. Retrieved 16 February 2014 from ''[[ProQuest]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A camouflage passport is not a real, valid passport and is to be distinguished from a valid [[second passport]], which an individual with [[dual citizenship]] may be eligible to hold, a novelty ''fantasy passport'', or a [[Fake passport|fake]] of a real passport.

==Origins==
False identity documents have a long history, but in 1998, the idea of the camouflage passport was credited by ''The Financial Times'' to Donna Walker of Houston, who said she had got the idea ten years earlier when an American on a hijacked aircraft was shot because of his nationality. 

Walker said that she started by asking the Sri Lankan embassy whether they still had rights over the name ''Ceylon'' and, finding they did not, went on to ask the U.S. State Department whether producing a passport in that name would be illegal, they "couldn't show me it wasn't". Walker went on to produce hundreds of passports in different country names, trading as International Documents Service, and described her "finest hour" as being during the [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] when a group of European oil executives were able to use her documents to pass through Iraqi checkpoints and escape to Jordan. 

She said the basic idea was to look like "a not very interesting man from a not very interesting country".&lt;ref&gt;"How to travel under cover" by John Westbrooke in ''The Financial Times'', 24 January 1998, p. 2. Retrieved 14 January 2014 from ''Gale News Vault''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form ==
Camouflage passports are generally produced in the name of countries that no longer exist or have changed their name.&lt;ref name=EUlist/&gt; 

Often these are former colonies that changed their name on independence, or use the names of places or political subdivisions that exist within a real country but have never issued or cannot issue passports (for instance, the British Hebrides which are islands off the west coast of Scotland that have never been separately independent). 

Usually, the names chosen have a plausible or familiar ring to them. Names that have been used include:

*British Guiana (now Guyana)
*British Hebrides (islands off the west coast of Scotland usually known just as "The Hebrides") 
*British Honduras (now Belize)
*British Hong Kong (now a Special Administrative Region of China, never had the prefix "British")
*British West Indies (has never existed as a passport-issuing entity)
*Burma (now Myanmar)
*Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)
*Dutch Guiana (now Suriname)
*Eastern Samoa (now American Samoa)
*Netherlands East Indies (Now Indonesia)
*New Granada (Presumably meaning [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|the Spanish colony]] or the [[Republic of New Granada]], 1831–1858; now in Colombia and Panama)
*New Hebrides (now Vanuatu)
*Rhodesia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.com/news/2007/mar/27/camouflaged-passport-advantage/ "The Camouflaged Passport Advantage: How Getting a Fake Passport Just Might Save Your Life"] by Barney Brantingham in ''[[The Santa Barbara Independent]]'', 27 March 2007. Retrieved 14 January 2014. [https://www.webcitation.org/6McaaV4un?url=http://www.independent.com/news/2007/mar/27/camouflaged-passport-advantage/ Archived here.] &lt;/ref&gt; (now Zimbabwe)
*South Vietnam (now Vietnam)
*Spanish Guinea (now Equatorial Guinea)
*The Soviet Union (now divided into fifteen States)
*Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania)

==Purpose and legality==
According to sellers, the purpose of a true camouflage passport, rather than a novelty fantasy passport, is to provide false identification to be used in an emergency to protect the bearer from unwelcome attention at border crossings or anywhere that they might be asked to produce their documents and could be at risk. The camouflage passport, they say, is therefore intended primarily to deceive a customs, immigration or police officer into believing that the bearer is a person from a small, unimportant, and far away country that is not an enemy, or, in a terrorist situation, that the bearer is not a potentially high value hostage.

Others argue, however, that the true purpose of these documents is to be used in criminal activity, including terrorism and [[money laundering]], and that the majority of camouflage passports are bought for those purposes. After the attacks of [[9/11]], the United States restricted the sale of camouflage passports,{{citation required|date=January 2014}} although they are still legal to possess in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and all of the European Union.{{citation required|date=January 2014}} Laws elsewhere may vary.

In 2011, the [[European Union]] resolved that a "non-exhaustive list of known fantasy and camouflage passports" should be drawn up that "should not be subject to recognition or non-recognition. They should not entitle their holders to cross the external borders and should not be endorsed with a visa."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/borders-and-visas/document-security/docs/decision_1105_2011_trav_docs_en.pdf "DECISION No 1105/2011/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25 October 2011 on the list of travel documents which entitle the holder to cross the external borders and which may be endorsed with a visa and on setting up a mechanism for establishing this list"] in ''[[Official Journal of the European Union]]'', 4.11.2011, L 287/9, para 10. Retrieved 16 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A list was subsequently published and last updated in January 2014.&lt;ref name=EUlist&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/document-security/docs/list_of_known_fantasy_and_camouflage_passports_en.pdf ''INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NON- EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF KNOWN FANTASY AND CAMOUFLAGE PASSPORTS, AS STIPULATED BY ARTICLE 6 OF THE DECISION NO 1105/2011/EU (to which a visa may not be affixed) BASED {{sic|OF|hide=y}} INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE MEMBER STATES UNTIL 29.01.2014''] European Union, 29 January 2014. Retrieved 16 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sellers==
The producers of camouflage passports are generally internet based businesses that specialise in producing various types of identify documents that may be in real or false names. Other services often offered include [[offshore company]] formation, introductions to [[offshore banking]] and [[financial services]] providers and similar services all targeted at international mobile individuals and those interested in avoiding tax and government regulation. Despite several companies withdrawing from this market in recent years, others continue to operate, offering passports that purport to include UV tags and holograms for verisimilitude.

==Fantasy passports==
[[Image:passports.jpg|thumb|A Nevada fantasy passport]]
[[File:expopass.jpg|right|thumb| Expo 67 passport]]
Fantasy passports are passport-like documents issued as a novelty or souvenir, to make a political statement or to show loyalty to a political or other cause.

Souvenir United States state passports have also been issued, for Nevada or the Republic of Texas for instance, but these typically are clearly marked as novelties.

Examples include:

*The [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy]] has issued '''[[Iroquois passports]]''' which its [[lacrosse]] team has attempted to use when participating in international competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=reznetnews|url=http://www.reznetnews.org/article/iroquois-passport-dispute-raises-sovereignty-issue|title=Iriquois Passport Dispute Raises Sovereignty Issue|accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Conch Republic]] passports'''.

'''Combat endurance''' is the time that a military system or unit can remain in [[combat]] before having to withdraw due to depleted resources.&lt;ref name="Leonard2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Barry|title=Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms: As Amended Through April 2010|year=2011|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4379-3820-3|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition is not precise; for example the combat endurance of an [[aircraft]], without qualification, is usually the time the aircraft can remain at an [[altitude]] suitable for combat, but in a particular [[theatre of operations]] it is the time it can remain in the area of combat. During the [[Battle of Britain]], for example, the combat endurance of German [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] was the time they could remain over [[United Kingdom|Britain]], i.e., their inherent ([[Endurance (aeronautics)|endurance]])less the time to travel from their base to Britain, and the time to return—about 15 minutes.

In addition to fuel the expenditure of ammunition and other consumables will reduce combat endurance, for example the limiting factors for a nuclear attack submarine are its torpedoes or for an nuclear aircraft carrier aviation fuel and aircraft munitions.

[[Military organization|Military units]] will have a combat endurance, how long they can stay in the field for,  measured by how long its logistics train can keep its component subunits supplied with food, fuel,  ammunition and spare parts etc.

The [[United States Department of Defense]] and [[NATO]] define endurance as "the time an aircraft can continue flying, or a ground vehicle or ship can continue operating, under specified conditions, e.g., without refueling."&lt;ref name="Leonard2011" /&gt;

'''Combat endurance training''' is also used for a system of [[physical training]] associated with [[endurance|stamina]].

== Improving combat endurance ==
The improvements of combat endurance are largely concerned with better efficiency to the current platforms and they aim to bridge the gap between the resources available today and the future. Technology, therefore, dominates this field&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Issues|last=Boon|first=Kristen|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780195398076|location=Oxford|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one specific aspect that demonstrates this involves the technologies that enhance [[Energy efficiency in transport|fuel efficiency]]. There are three improvement categories focused on this area:

* fundamental: involves new vehicle configurations that affect overall aerodynamics and structural efficiency; new propulsion architecture and over the longer term fuels
* major subsystem increments: engine improvements and use of new structural materials
* small component evolution: use of more efficient generators, thrusters, and material substitution, among others&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=More Fight -- Less Fuel: Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on DoD Energy Strategy|last=Schlesinger|first=James|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=2008|isbn=9781437917147|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] identified three breakthrough technologies that could significantly improve its capabilities and combat endurance and these are: 1) blended wing body for fixed-wing, heavy-lift aircraft; 2) variable speed tilt rotor for vertical lift aircraft; and, 3) blast bucket design concept for light armor ground vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first '''Commonwealth Study Conference''' held in Oxford, United Kingdom in 1956 to study the human aspects of industrial issues across Commonwealth countries.&lt;ref&gt;CSC Australia {{cite web |url=http://www.cscaustralia.com/cscaustralia.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913044442/http://www.cscaustralia.com/cscaustralia.asp |archivedate=2009-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of the conference, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|HRH Prince Philip, The Duke of Edinburgh]], described it as "an extraordinary experiment" that provided an opportunity for people from all over the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and all walks of life to leave their usual roles and, with a diverse group of people, examine the relationship between industry and the community around it.&lt;ref&gt;The Commonwealth Study Conferences http://www.csc-alumni.org/About-CSC-Alumni/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/10/181994/princess-anne-scheduled-three-day-visit-malaysia-oct-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2042515&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4080258.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants are drawn from all sectors of society and particularly included people from government bodies, [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOS), [[trade unions]] and businesses.  On average 300 people attend such a conference and are afforded a unique opportunity to examine a broad range of society, how each component functions and its interactions with others.

Since 1956 ten separate Commonwealth Study Conferences have taken place, variously hosted in [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. A number of related Regional conferences have also been held.

==History==

In 2006 a comprehensive 204 page book [http://www.csc-alumni.org/Alumni-Support/50th-anniversary-book.html Leadership In The Making] was published in Canada, celebrating 50 years since the first conference in 1956.  Prince Phillip describes how the idea came about:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The idea for the conference arose as a result of my visit to Canada in 1954.  I had asked to visit some of the new and developing industries in Canada's far north on the way home from the Commonwealth Games in Vancouver.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Two things struck me.  The great majority of these developments were 'single-industry' enterprises, and in most cases the towns associated with the industries were 'company towns'.  This is not typical for an industrialised country, but it had the effect of drawing my attention to one of the basic problems faced by industrial communities.  While a company in control of an industrial enterprise has to be based on a system of managerial and technical qualifications, the town in which all the workers and the management have to live needs to be managed by some democratic system involving all the inhabitants as citizens.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The purpose of the conference was to look into the tensions, problems and opportunities created by this dichotomy between industrial enterprise and community development."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[real estate appraisal]], the '''cost approach''' is one of three basic valuation methods.&lt;ref&gt;Uniform Standard of Professional Appraisal Practice, 2008, Appraisal Foundation, Standards Rule 1-4(b) p. U18
&lt;/ref&gt; The others are market approach, or [[sales comparison approach]], and [[income approach]]. The fundamental premise of the cost approach is that a potential user of [[real estate]] won't, or shouldn't, pay more for a property than it would cost to build an equivalent. The cost of construction minus depreciation, plus land, therefore is a limit, or at least a metric, of market value.

There are some fairly large assumptions embedded here. One of the basics is that there is a sufficient supply of buildable land that construction is a viable alternative to purchase of an existing property. In some parts of the world today, including in the USA, there are areas which are either so fully developed, or so restrictive in their planning approvals, that new construction is not an option because of the scarcity of land. A related question is whether the building in question is anything that would actually be built again in that market. If the trend of development favors, say, high volume warehousing, would anyone consider building a multi-story manufacturing facility? If the trend is to high density condominium buildings, would anyone consider building a detached house? The cost of constructing an obsolete building isn't considered relevant to market value.

There are other methodological issues which can be problematic. How do you estimate cost? Is it based on reproduction of an exact replica or something that is judged to be functionally equivalent? Can you even estimate cost very exactly? When a project is put up to bid, is there not usually a range of prices offered for the same plans and specifications? Is the final cost of a project equal to the original bid? How should profit be treated? Some maintain that the cost approach will normally be the highest of the three approaches. At the same time it is a [[truism]] that a project is only feasible if its projected cost is less than its completed value. 

In between new and totally obsolete various negative elements related to age, fashion and change (depreciation) will accrue. These are lumped into physical (wear, tear and deterioration), functional (look, feel, form and style), and locational (the influence of factors outside the property itself).

It is generally considered that the cost approach gives the best indication of market value when the property in question is new and an appropriate (highest and best) use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4066">The '''Data Warehouse System — Electronic Surveillance Data Management System''' (DWS-EDMS) is an electronic [[database]] created by the Special Technologies and Applications Section (STAS) of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. Disclosed in a heavily redacted review of the FBI's role in the prevention of the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]], its full capabilities are classified but at a minimum, provides a searchable archive of intercepted electronic communications, including email sent over the Internet.&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/final-report-of-the-william-h.-webster-commission |title=Final Report of the Judge William H.

By the third quarter of 2006 it was involved in 130 successful investigations and 370 active cases.&lt;ref name="budget2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/jmd/2008justification/exhibit300/fbi_edms.pdf |title=FY 2008 Congressional Budget Submission |author=Federal Bureau of Investigation |accessdate=19 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020144238/http://www.justice.gov/jmd/2008justification/exhibit300/fbi_edms.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007 a total of 70 million intercepts from 16,500 online accounts were present on the system, and were expected to increase to 350 million intercepts from over 50,000 accounts by June 2009.&lt;ref name="budget2009" /&gt;

== History ==

The DWS was designed by STAS in 2001 to record a certain class of data intercepts. In the following years it became a de facto depository of a wider category of intercepts, surpassing its original intent and straining its hardware limits.

The DWS was involved in the interception of 18 email messages between [[Nidal Malik Hasan]] and [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] from December 2008 to June 2009, although the messages were largely benign and provided no actionable evidence.

It was upgraded in February 2009, improving the user interface and tools, and merged with a related system, EDMS. The user interface was again improved in May 2009.

== Capabilities ==

The interface of DWS-EDMS is described as relatively crude. Intercepts are stored in [[E-text|text format]]. The primary user interface is similar to [[Outlook Express]]. Users can add notes, translations, and [[tag (metadata)|tags]] to intercepts. While it provides search capabilities, it does so poorly, failing to return many relevant results. Although it is one of the FBI's primary investigative tools, it does not have a backup scheme in place. A failure scenario such as [[data corruption]] would be considered catastrophic. As of 2011, it was considered to be overburdened and incapable of sustaining its present role.&lt;ref name="webster" /&gt;

The underlying infrastructure of DWS-EDMS uses widely available commercial and [[open source]] technologies, including [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Red Hat Linux]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] [[SQL]], [[XML]], [[Microsoft IIS]], and [[Apache HTTP Server]].&lt;ref name="budget2008" /&gt;

His book ''The Wilson Plot'' (1988) increased public interest in [[Harold Wilson conspiracy theories|alleged attempts]] by the British security services and others to destabilise [[Harold Wilson]]'s government in the 1970s. His 1995 TV documentary for ''[[World in Action]]'', "Jonathan of Arabia", led after a libel trial to the jailing for [[perjury]] of former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] defence minister [[Jonathan Aitken]].&lt;ref name="icij.org"/&gt;

With his colleague Rob Evans, Leigh published a series of corruption exposures in ''The Guardian'' about international arms giant [[BAE Systems]]. After a criminal inquiry by the [[US Department of Justice]] and other international prosecutors, the company was eventually required to pay penalties totalling $529 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BAE Systems to pay $79m fine for breach of US military export rules |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/17/bae-to-pay-79m-dollar-fine-to-us |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Leigh became the Anthony Sampson Professor of Reporting in the Journalism department at [[City University London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Leigh to become Britain’s first professor of reporting |url=http://www.city.ac.uk/citynews/archive/2006/09_september/27092006_1.html |publisher=Citynews |date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=20 November 2006 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife's sister married [[Alan Rusbridger]], who later became editor of ''The Guardian''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11418362/Lord-Mackie-of-Benshie-obituary.html|title=Lord Mackie of Benshie - obituary|date=17 February 2015|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WikiLeaks===
In 2010 Leigh was a member of the team which handled the release of United States diplomatic and military documents which had been passed to [[WikiLeaks]], and which worked closely with [[Julian Assange]]. The relationship soured after the Guardian published details of allegations of sexual misbehaviour made against Assange by two Swedish women. This caused David Leigh to [[Twitter|tweet]]: "The #guardian published too many leaks for #Assange&amp;nbsp;'s liking, it seems. So now he's signed up 'exclusively' with #Murdoch's Times. Gosh."&lt;ref&gt;Tiku, Nitasha [http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/12/julian_assange_picks_a_media.html "Julian Assange Picks a Media Fight With the Guardian"], ''New York Magazine'', 21 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy]]'' (Guardian Books 2011), written  with [[Luke Harding]], Leigh mentioned the password to a set of unredacted classified [[United States diplomatic cables leak|US State Department cables]]. WikiLeaks had distributed multiple copies of [[encrypted]] files containing these cables, and others had mirrored the data with [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]. Defending himself against criticism for subsequently dumping out all this data,  Assange criticised Leigh and the ''Guardian'' instead, for unnecessarily disclosing the password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leak at WikiLeaks: A Dispatch Disaster in Six Acts |first=Christian |last=Stöcker |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,783778,00.html |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903181457/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0%2C1518%2C783778%2C00.html |archivedate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=no |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=4 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response ''The Guardian'' said "it's nonsense to suggest the Guardian's WikiLeaks book has compromised security in any way". According to ''The Guardian'', WikiLeaks had indicated that the password was temporary and that WikiLeaks had seven months to take action to protect the files it had subsequently decided to post online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unredacted US embassy cables available online after WikiLeaks breach |first=James |last=Ball |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/01/unredacted-us-embassy-cables-online |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64QIzbGtR?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/01/unredacted-us-embassy-cables-online |archivedate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=3 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The book was made into a 2014 Hollywood movie, "The Fifth Estate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1837703/|title=The Fifth Estate|date=18 October 2013|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Assange's supporters complained that he and Wikileaks were not given any money for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commondreams.org/views/2014/11/17/siege-julian-assange-farce-special-investigation|title=The Siege of Julian Assange is a Farce - A Special Investigation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, after ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine criticised an allegedly antisemitic Wikileaks associate [[Israel Shamir]], editor [[Ian Hislop]] reported that Assange telephoned  and complained of a campaign led by ''The Guardian'' to smear Wikileaks and deprive it of Jewish  donations. Three people involved, including Leigh,  according to Assange, were Jewish.  Hislop says he pointed out that at least one of the three was not in fact Jewish and that this "Jewish conspiracy" was unconvincing. Assange eventually backed down and told Hislop to, "Forget the Jewish thing."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Quinn [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/01/julian-assange-jewish-conspiracy-comments "Julian Assange 'Jewish conspiracy' comments spark row"], ''The Guardian'', 1 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Assange said, "Hislop has distorted, invented or misremembered almost every significant claim and phrase."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/british-magazine-assange-says-jewish-conspiracy-trying-to-discredit-wikileaks-1.346686 "British magazine: Assange says Jewish conspiracy trying to discredit WikiLeaks"], ''Haaretz'', 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In a further spat in 2012, Assange referred in a press release to: "an information mule in the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'', Yossi Melman, who conspired with ''Guardian'' journalist David Leigh to secretly, and in violation of WikiLeaks' contract with the ''Guardian'', move WikiLeaks' U.S. diplomatic cables to Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Anshel Pfeffer and Ben-Tovim, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-kurdish-fighters-destroyed-iran-nuclear-facility-email-released-by-wikileaks-claims-1.415066 ''Israel, Kurdish fighters destroyed Iran nuclear facility, email released by WikiLeaks claims'', ''Haaretz'', 27 February 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Melman characterised this as a "clumsy smear" attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Tabletmag.com |title=Jewish news and politics - Assanges-Chutzpah |date=28 February 2012 |url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/92332/assanges-chutzpah/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 1979, he won a British Press Awards special award for exposing jury-vetting, whilst a reporter at the Guardian. In 1985, he won Investigative Reporter of the Year in the Granada TV What the Paper Say awards, for exposing MI5 vetting of BBC staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/anniversaries/august|title=BBC - August anniversaries - History of the BBC|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he won the [[Paul Foot Award|Paul Foot]] Award, with his colleague Rob Evans, for the BAE [[bribery]] exposures. The prize was awarded annually by ''[[Private Eye]]'' and ''The Guardian'' in memory of the campaigning journalist Paul Foot. Leigh and Evans were also presented with the [[Granada TV]] ''[[What the Papers Say]]'' Judges' Award for "an outstanding piece of investigative journalism that uncovered a story of great significance". In 2010, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists gave him and five other journalists the Daniel Pearl Award for their investigation of toxic waste dumping by oil traders Trafigura.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicintegrity.org/news/entry/2045/ "ICIJ Names Winners of 2010 Daniel Pearl Awards for Outstanding International Investigative Reporting"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907000000/http://www.publicintegrity.org/news/entry/2045/ |date=7 September 2010 }}, ICIJ, 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he and a Guardian team he led won Investigation of the Year at the British Journalism Awards for their exposure of tax-dodging at HSBC's Swiss bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/sunday-times-insight-editor-jonathan-calvert-named-journalist-year-british-journalism-awards-full/|title=Jonathan Calvert of Sunday Times is Journalist of the Year: British Journalism Awards full list of winners – Press Gazette|website=www.pressgazette.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the [[Press Gazette]] listed him as third in their list of the top ten investigative journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/press-gazettes-top-ten-investigative-journalists-brave-and-unstoppable-nick-davies-tops-list |title=Press Gazette's top ten investigative journalists: 'Brave and unstoppable' Nick Davies tops the list |publisher=PressGazette |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4708">{{Politics of Northern Cyprus}}
The '''Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus''' takes place in a framework of a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Northern Cyprus|President]] is [[head of state]] and the '''Prime Minister''' [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Assembly of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|Assembly of the Republic]]. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The Prime Minister must control a majority of parliament in order to govern. The office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not a permanent position, existing only at the discretion of the [[Prime Minister of Northern Cyprus|Prime Minister]].

Unlike analogous offices in some other nations, such as a vice-presidency, the [[Deputy Prime Minister]] possesses no special constitutional powers under the Constitution of Northern Cyprus as such, though they will always have particular responsibilities in government. They do not assume the duties and powers of the Prime Minister in the latter's absence, illness, or death. The Deputy Prime Minister does not automatically succeed the Prime Minister when the latter is incapacitated, or resigns from the leadership of his or her party. The designation of someone to the role of Deputy Prime Minister may provide additional practical status within the cabinet, enabling exercise of ''[[de facto]]'', if not ''[[de jure]]'', power.

In a coalition government, such as the [[Özgürgün cabinet]] between the [[National Unity Party (Northern Cyprus)|National Unity Party]] and [[Democratic Party (Northern Cyprus)|Democratic Party]], the appointment of the leader of the smaller party (in this case, [[Serdar Denktaş]], leader of the Democratic Party) as Deputy Prime Minister is done to give that person more authority within the cabinet to enforce the coalition's agreed-upon agenda. The Deputy Prime Minister usually deputises for the Prime Minister at official functions. The current [[Erhürman cabinet]] has [[Kudret Özersay]] as the Deputy Prime Minister, receiving the seniority as the leader of the second biggest party ([[People's Party (Northern Cyprus)|People's Party]]) of the 4-party coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kuzey Kıbrıs'ta 4 partili hükümet kuruldu |url=https://tr.sputniknews.com/dogu_akdeniz/201802021032078270-kuzey-kibris-hukumet-kuruldu-tufan-erhurman/ |accessdate=25 September 2018 |publisher=Sputnik News |date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|the events in 1974]], an executive committee was formed to govern Northern Cyprus on August 26, 1974. This committee later established the [[Autonomous Turkish Cypriot Administration]]. [[Rauf Denktaş]] was both serving as the [[head of state]] and the [[head of government]] of ATCA. [[Osman Örek]] served as the Vice President and the Minister of Defence of ATCA, becoming the first deputy leader of the government. The position of Vice Presidency was abolished after the establishment of [[Turkish Federated State of Cyprus]], since it was a semi-presidential republic.&lt;ref name="Hükûmetler"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hükûmetler |url=http://www.cm.gov.nc.tr/Bilgi/H%DCK%DCMETLER.pdf |publisher=[[Assembly of the Republic (Northern Cyprus)|Assembly of the Republic]] |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the establishment of TFSC, Vedat Çelik was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence and Foreign Affairs of the first cabinet. However after the cabinet changes on July 7, 1977 the office of the Deputy Prime Minister of the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus was abolished.&lt;ref name="Hükûmetler"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Deputy Prime Minister of the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] was [[Özker Özgür]] who served at the First and Second [[Hakkı Atun|Atun]] cabinets as the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of State. The position of the Deputy Prime Minister was abolished by the formation of the Eighth [[Derviş Eroğlu|Eroğlu]] Cabinet and reinstalled by the formation of the [[Yorgancıoğlu cabinet]] and used by the all following governments with the exception of [[Kalyoncu cabinet]].&lt;ref name="Hükûmetler"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desmond Ravenstone''' ([[Boston, Massachusetts]]) is a writer, blogger, activist and educator on sexuality issues, who has addressed on [[BDSM]] and other [[alternative sexuality|alternative sexual identities]], and currently focuses on [[sex workers' rights]].  A former [[Unitarian Universalist]] [[lay leader]], he has frequently addressed the intersection of [[religion and sexuality|sexuality and spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teach.itg.emerson.edu/surviveandthrive/2009/12/polyamorous-community-seeks-mo.html |title=Polyamorous community seeks more support from Unitarian Universalist Association |publisher=Survive And Thrive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ravenstone first became involved in the BDSM community addressing the issue of "ravishment" or [[rape fantasy|rape fantasies]].  He wrote a number of articles and two books.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenstone, Desmond.  ''Ravishment: The Dark Side of Erotic Fantasy'' (2005)  {{ISBN|1-4116-5547-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravenstone, Desmond.  ''Taken: A Story of Ravishment'' (2005)  {{ISBN|1-4116-5559-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with both the psychology and practical enactment of ravishment role-play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/ADULT/blogs/eroticenquirer/archive/2008/03/19/holy-whip.aspx |title=Holy Whip: Interview with Desmond Ravenstone |publisher=Thephoenix.com |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to form the online Ravishment Network (RavNet) as a forum for education and advocacy.

Ravenstone has also led workshops on ravishment, [[sexual roleplaying|erotic role-playing]] and other subjects to a number of BDSM groups across the country.  He served as education coordinator for the New England Dungeon Society for two years, and authored an advice column for the online [[zine]] '‘The Dominant's View'’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedomsview.com/Vol6/I6/deardesmond.htm |title=Dear Desmond, Advice for the Kinky (archive) |publisher=Thedomsview.com |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravenstone was a member of [[Arlington Street Church]], an historic [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregation, where he served on the worship committee as well as Co-Moderator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ascboston.org/about/governance.html|title=Arlington Street Church - About Us: Governance }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other leadership roles; in the past, he has represented the congregation as a delegate to the Mass Bay District and the [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uupa.org/reports/GA2014-report |title=Report on General Assembly 2014 (PDF document) |publisher=Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502090905/http://uupa.org/reports/GA2014-report |archivedate=May 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote a blog for several years, '‘‘Ravenstone's Reflections'’’, offering his thoughts on sexuality, spirituality, politics and other related topics.  This gave him a prominent place to speak on behalf of kinksters, [[polyamory|polyamorists]] and other "alt-sexers" within the UU denomination.  Ravenstone started the organization [[Leather &amp; Grace]], for UUs identified with kink and BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leatherandgrace.wordpress.com |title=Leather &amp; Grace website |publisher=Leatherandgrace.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, he published a lengthy post on his blog, defending the view that kink should be regarded as a [[sexual orientation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com/2014/10/towards-more-inclusive-model-of-sexual.html |title=Towards a More Inclusive Model of Sexual Orientation |publisher=ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also carried as a guest blog on the website of the [[National Coalition for Sexual Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=https://ncsfreedom.org/?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=1007 |title=NCSF Guest Blog: Towards a More Inclusive Model of Sexual Orientation |publisher= National Coalition for Sexual Freedom |date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Ravenstone posted on his blog that he was leaving organized Unitarian Universalism, expressing frustration at how resistant the leadership of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]'s handled many issues, including those around sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com/2015/10/this-is-goodbye.html |title=This is Goodbye |publisher=ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com |date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, he officially ended ''Ravenstone's Reflections'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com/2017/01/moving-on.html |title=Moving On ... |publisher=ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com |date=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced the start of a new blog devoted specifically to [[sex workers' rights]], ''The Harlot's Bulldog''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harlotsbulldog.wordpress.com/about/ |title=The Harlot's Bulldog |publisher=harlotsbulldog.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently administrates the website for Clients of Sex Workers Allied for Change (CoSWAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexworkclients.org |title=CoSWAC: Clients of Sex Workers Allied for Change |publisher=sexworkclients.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravenstone is politically unaffiliated, and describes himself as a "[[left libertarianism|libertarian progressive]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/people/Desmond-Ravenstone/100000472704628 |title=Desmond Ravenstone's Facebook page |publisher=Facebook.com |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "deep pragmatist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harlotsbulldog.wordpress.com/about/ |title=The Harlot's Bulldog |publisher=harlotsbulldog.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he ran a [[write-in]] campaign for president on a sexual freedom platform; his running-mate was [[Darklady|Theresa "Darklady" Reed]], a fellow writer and sexual-freedom activist from [[Oregon]].

In [[Marxism|Marxist]] sociopolitical thought, the '''dictatorship of the proletariat''' is a state of affairs in which the [[proletariat]], or the working class, has control of political power.&lt;ref name="auth"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm|title= On Authority|publisher= |accessdate= 13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="manif"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/|title= Manifesto of the Communist Party|author1= Karl Marx |author2= Frederick Engels |publisher= |accessdate= 13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, it is the intermediate system between [[capitalism]] and [[communism]], when the government is in the process of changing the ownership of the [[means of production]] from [[Privatism|private]] to [[collective ownership]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Critique of the Gotha Programme—IV |work= Critique of the Gotha Programme |url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch04.htm |accessdate= 2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the existence of any [[government]] implies the dictatorship of one social class over another. The term, coined by [[Joseph Weydemeyer]], was adopted in the 19th century by the founders of Marxism, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. Both of them argued that the short-lived [[Paris Commune]], which ran the French capital for over two months in 1871 before being suppressed, was an example of the dictatorship of the proletariat. "[[Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]" is thus used as an [[antonym]] of "dictatorship of the proletariat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lenin|first= Vladimir|title= [[The State and Revolution]]|chapter-url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch01.htm |chapter= Class society and the state|year= 1918 |publisher= Lenin Internet Archive (marxists.org)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is termed "dictatorship" because it retains the [[state apparatus]] as such, with its implements of force and oppression, but differs from the popular notion of [[dictatorship]] which Marxists despise as the selfish, immoral, irresponsible and unconstitutional political rule of one man. It instead implies a stage where there is complete "socialization of the major means of production",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= An introduction to political theory|last= O.P.Gauba|first= |publisher= Mayur paperbacks|year= 2015|isbn= |location= New Delhi|pages= 607,608}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words planning of material production so as to serve social needs, provide for an effective right to work, education, health and housing for the masses and fuller development of science and technology so as to multiply material production to achieve greater social satisfaction. However, social division into classes still exists, but the proletariat become the dominant class and oppression is still used to suppress the bourgeois [[counter-revolution]]. 

There are two main trends for this political thought, yet both of them retain the state apparatus for its enforcement capabilities:
* [[Marxism–Leninism]] follows the ideas of [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] as interpreted by [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s successor [[Joseph Stalin]]. It seeks to establish a [[vanguardism | vanguard party]] to lead a proletarian uprising, to assume state power on behalf of the proletariat and to construct a [[single-party]] [[socialist state]] representing a dictatorship of the proletariat, governed through the process of [[democratic centralism]], which Lenin described as "diversity in discussion, unity in action". Marxism–Leninism forms the official ideology of the ruling parties of [[China]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]] and was the official ideology of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and of the other ruling parties making up the [[Eastern Bloc]].
* [[Libertarian Marxism|Libertarian Marxists]], especially [[Luxemburgism|Luxemburgists]], criticize Marxism–Leninism for its differences from [[orthodox Marxism]] and oppose the [[Leninist]] principle of democratic centralism and the Leninist strategy of vanguardism. Along with [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], they also oppose the use of a [[one-party state]] which they view as inherently undemocratic, although Trotskyists are still [[Bolshevism|Bolsheviks]], subscribing to [[Vanguardism|vanguard party]], democratic centralism and [[soviet democracy]], seeing themselves as the true successors of Leninism. [[Rosa Luxemburg]], a Marxist theorist, emphasized the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat as the rule of the whole class, representing the majority and not a single party, characterizing the dictatorship of the proletariat as a concept meant to expand democracy rather than reduce it as opposed to minority rule in the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, the only other class state power can reside in according to Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Luxemburg|first=Rosa|title=The Russian Revolution|year=1918|publisher=Workers Age Publishers|location=New York|chapter-url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1918/russian-revolution/ch08.htm |chapter=Democracy and Dictatorship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]] argued in the book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' that the dictatorship of the proletariat, even if democratic, would probably destroy personal freedom as completely as in a [[autocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|year=1944|title=The Road To Serfdom|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-226-32061-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical approaches==

===Karl Marx===
[[Karl Marx]] did not write much about the nature of the dictatorship of the proletariat, with his published works instead largely focusing on analysing and criticising capitalist society. In 1848, he and Engels wrote in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' that "their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions".&lt;ref&gt;[[Communist Manifesto]], 1848, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch04.htm Chapter IV]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, commenting on [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|revolution in Vienna]] he again highlighted the role of the violence, saying that "there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/11/06.htm | title=The Victory of the Counter-Revolution in Vienna | publisher=Neue Rheinische Zeitung | date=1848 | accessdate=2015-04-25 | author=Karl Marx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1852, the communist journalist [[Joseph Weydemeyer]] published an article entitled "Dictatorship of the Proletariat" in the German language newspaper ''[[Turn-Zeitung]]'', where he wrote that "it is quite plain that there cannot be here any question of gradual, peaceful transitions" and recalled the examples of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (England) and [[Committee of Public Safety]] (France) as examples of "dictatorship" and "terrorism" (respectively) required to overthrow the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The dictatorship of the proletariat|journal=Labor History|year=1962|volume=3|issue=2|pages=214–217|doi=10.1080/00236566208583900|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00236566208583900|accessdate=October 15, 2011|author=Joseph Weydemeyer|authorlink=Joseph Weydemeyer|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Marx wrote to him, saying: {{quote|Long before me, bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this struggle between the classes, as had bourgeois economists their economic anatomy. My own contribution was (1) to show that the existence of classes is merely bound up with certain historical phases in the development of production; (2) that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat; [and] (3) that this dictatorship, itself, constitutes no more than a transition to the abolition of all classes and to a [[classless society]]|Karl Marx|1852&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/letters/52_03_05.htm letter from Marx to Joseph Weydemeyer] dated March 5, 1852 in Karl Marx &amp; Frederick Engels, ''Collected Works Vol. 39'' (International Publishers: New York, 1983) pp. 62–65.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marx expanded upon his ideas about the dictatorship of the proletariat in his short 1875 work, ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'', a scathing criticism and attack on the principles laid out in the programme of the German Workers' Party (predecessor to the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]). The programme presented a moderate, [[Reformism|evolutionary way to socialism]] as opposed to [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]], violent approach of the "orthodox" Marxists. As a result the latter accused the Gotha program as being "revisionist" and ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111gotha.html|title=The Gotha and Erfurt Programs|publisher=|date=1875|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx stated that in a proletarian-run society the state should control the "proceeds of labour" (i.e. all the food and products produced) and take from them that which was "an economic necessity", namely enough to replace "the means of production used up", an "additional portion for expansion of production" and "insurance funds" to be used in emergencies such as natural disasters. Furthermore, he believed that the state should then take enough to cover administrative costs, funds for the running of [[public services]] and funds for those who were physically incapable of working. Once enough to cover all of these things had been taken out of the "proceeds of labour", Marx believed that what was left should then be shared out amongst the workers, with each individual getting goods to the equivalent value of how much labour they had invested.&lt;ref name="Marx 1875. Chapter One"&gt;[[#Mar75|Marx 1875]]. Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] manner, those workers who put in more labour and worked harder would get more of the proceeds of the collective labour than someone who had not worked as hard.

In the ''Critique'', he noted that "defects are inevitable" and there would be many difficulties in initially running such a workers' state "as it emerges from capitalistic society" because it would be "economically, morally and intellectually... still stamped with the birth marks of the old society from whose womb it emerges", thereby still containing capitalist elements.&lt;ref name="Marx 1875. Chapter One"/&gt;

In other works, Marx stated that he considered the [[Paris Commune]] (a revolutionary socialism supporting government that ran the city of Paris from March to May 1871) as an example of the proletarian dictatorship. Describing the short-lived regime, he remarked: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Commune was formed of the municipal councilors, chosen by [[universal suffrage]] in the various wards of the town, responsible, and revocable at short terms. The majority of its members were naturally workers, or acknowledged representatives of the working class. The Commune was to be a working, not a parliamentary body, executive, and legislative at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Marx &amp; Engels Collected Works|volume=22|year=1986|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York|page=331|chapter=The Civil War in France}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This form of popular government, featuring revocable election of councilors and maximal public participation in governance, resembles contemporary [[direct democracy]].

===Friedrich Engels===
Force and violence played an important role in [[Friedrich Engels]]'s vision of the revolution and rule of proletariat. In 1877, arguing with [[Eugen Dühring]], Engels ridiculed his reservations against use of force: {{quote|That force, however, plays yet another role in history, a revolutionary role; that, in the words of Marx, it is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one, that it is the instrument with the aid of which social movement forces its way through and shatters the dead, fossilised political forms|Friedrich Engels|''Anti-Duhring'', 1877&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch16.htm | title=Theory of Force (Conclusion) | year=1877 | accessdate=2013-11-06 | author=Engels, Friedrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1891 postscript to ''[[The Civil War in France]]'' (1872) pamphlet, Engels said: "Well and good, gentlemen, do you want to know what this dictatorship looks like? Look at the Paris Commune. That was the Dictatorship of the Proletariat"; to avoid bourgeois political corruption: &lt;blockquote&gt;[...] the Commune made use of two infallible expedients. In this first place, it filled all posts—administrative, judicial, and educational—by election on the basis of universal suffrage of all concerned, with the right of the same electors to recall their delegate at any time. And, in the second place, all officials, high or low, were paid only the wages received by other workers. The highest salary paid by the Commune to anyone was 6,000 francs. In this way an effective barrier to place-hunting and careerism was set up, even apart from the binding mandates to delegates [and] to representative bodies, which were also added in profusion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same year, he criticised "anti-authoritarian socialists", again referring to the methods of the [[Paris Commune]]: {{quote|A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?|Friedrich Engels|''On Authority'', 1872&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm | title=On Authority | year=1872 | accessdate=2013-11-06 | author=Engels, Friedrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marx's attention to the Paris Commune placed the [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] in the centre of later Marxist forms.

This statement was written in "Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League", which is credited to Marx and Engels: {{quote|[The workers] must work to ensure that the immediate revolutionary excitement is not suddenly suppressed after the victory. On the contrary, it must be sustained as long as possible. Far from opposing the so-called excesses – instances of popular vengeance against hated individuals or against public buildings with which hateful memories are associated – the workers’ party must not only tolerate these actions but must even give them direction.|Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels|"Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League", 1850&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm | title=Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League | year=1850 | accessdate=2013-11-06 |author1=Marx, Karl  |author2=Engels, Friedrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Vladimir Lenin==
In the 20th century, [[Vladimir Lenin]] developed [[Leninism]]—the adaptation of [[Marxism]] to the socio-economic and political conditions of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] (1721–1917). This body of theory later became the official [[ideology]] of some [[Communist states]].

''[[The State and Revolution]]'' (1917) explicitly discusses the practical implementation of "dictatorship of the proletariat" through means of violent revolution. Lenin denies any [[Reformism|reformist]] interpretations of Marxism, such as the one of [[Karl Kautsky]]'s. Lenin especially focused on Engels' phrase of the state "[[Withering away of the state|withering away]]", denying that it could apply to "bourgeois state" and highlighting that Engels work is mostly "panegyric on violent revolution". Based on these arguments, he denounces reformists as "opportunistic", reactionary and points out the [[red terror]] as the only&lt;ref&gt;''The supersession of the bourgeois state by the proletarian state is impossible without a violent revolution'' (The State and Revolution, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch01.htm#s3 Chapter 1])&lt;/ref&gt; method of introducing dictatorship of the proletariat compliant with Marx and Engels work.&lt;ref&gt;"The theory of Marx and Engels of the inevitability of a violent revolution refers to the bourgeois state. The latter cannot be superseded by the proletarian state (the dictatorship of the proletariat) through the process of 'withering away", but, as a general rule, only through a violent revolution. The panegyric Engels sang in its honor, and which fully corresponds to Marx's repeated statements". (''The State and Revolution'', [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch01.htm#s3 Chapter 1]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Imperial Russia, the Paris Commune model form of government was realised in the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] (councils of workers and soldiers) established in the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], whose revolutionary task was [[Deposition (politics)|deposing]] the capitalist (monarchical) state to establish [[socialism]]—the dictatorship of the proletariat—the stage preceding [[communism]].

In Russia, the [[Bolshevik]] Party (described by Lenin as the "vanguard of the proletariat") elevated the soviets to power in the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. Throughout 1917, Lenin argued that the [[Russian Provisional Government]] was unrepresentative of the proletariat's interests because in his estimation they represented the "dictatorship of the bourgeoisie". He argued that because they continually put off democratic elections, they denied the prominence of the democratically constituted soviets and all the promises made by liberal bourgeois parties prior to the [[February Revolution]] remained unfulfilled, the soviets would need to take power for themselves.

===Proletarian government===
Lenin argued that in an underdeveloped country such as Russia the capitalist class would remain a threat even after a successful socialist revolution.&lt;ref name="1918eq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/prrk/equality.htm|title=www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/prrk/equality.htm&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he advocated the repression of those elements of the capitalist class that took up arms against the new soviet government, writing that as long as classes existed a state would need to exist to exercise the democratic rule of one class (in his view, the working class) over the other (the capitalist class).&lt;ref name="1918eq"/&gt; He said: {{quotation|[...] Dictatorship does not necessarily mean the abolition of democracy for the class that exercises the dictatorship over other classes; but it does mean the abolition of democracy (or very material restriction, which is also a form of abolition) for the class over which, or against which, the dictatorship is exercised.|Vladimir Lenin&lt;ref&gt;V. I. Lenin, ''The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky. Collected Works,'' Vol. 28, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marx Engels Lenin on Scientific Socialism |publisher=Novosti Press Ajency Publishing House |year=1974 |place=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The use of violence, terror and rule of single communist party was criticised by [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. In response, Lenin accused Kautsky of being a "renegade" and "liberal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/prrk/index.htm|title=The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky|date=1918|author=Vladimir Lenin|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these socialist movements that did not support the [[Bolshevik]] party line were condemned by the [[Communist International]] and called [[social fascism]].{{when|date=March 2015}}

[[Soviet democracy]] granted [[voting rights]] to the majority of the populace who elected the local soviets, who elected the regional soviets and so on until electing the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]. Capitalists were disenfranchised in the Russian soviet model. However, according to Lenin in a developed country it would be possible to dispense with the disenfranchisement of capitalists within the democratic proletarian dictatorship as the proletariat would be guaranteed of an overwhelming majority.&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on Plenkhanov's Second Draft Programme''. Lenin Collected Works. Vol. 6, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bolsheviks in 1917–1924 did not claim to have achieved a communist society. In contrast the preamble to the 1977 [[1977 Soviet Constitution|Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (the "Brezhnev Constitution"), stated that the 1917 Revolution established the dictatorship of the proletariat as "a society of true democracy" and that "the supreme goal of the Soviet state is the building of a classless, communist society in which there will be public, communist self-government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/77cons01.html#preamble 1977 Constitution of the USSR, Part 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banning of opposition parties and factions===
During the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918–1922), all the major opposition parties either took up arms against the new Soviet government, took part in sabotage, [[Collaborationism|collaboration]] with the deposed [[absolute monarchy|Tsarists]], or made assassination attempts against Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. When opposition parties such as the Cadets and Mensheviks were democratically elected to the Soviets in some areas, they proceeded to use their mandate to welcome in Tsarist and foreign capitalist military forces. In one incident in Baku, the British military, once invited in, proceeded to execute members of the Bolshevik Party (who had peacefully stood down from the Soviet when they failed to win the elections). As a result, the Bolsheviks banned each opposition party when it turned against the Soviet government. In some cases, bans were lifted. This banning of parties did not have the same repressive character as later bans under Stalin would.&lt;ref name="Marcel Leibman 1980"&gt;Marcel Leibman (1980) ''Leninism under Lenin''&lt;/ref&gt;

Internally, Lenin's critics argued that such political suppression always was his plan. Supporters argued that the [[reactionary]] [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] of the foreign-sponsored [[White movement]] required it—given [[Fanya Kaplan]]'s unsuccessful assassination of Lenin on 30 August 1918 and the successful assassination of [[Moisei Uritsky]] the same day.

After 1919, the Soviets had ceased to function as organs of democratic rule as the famine induced by [[Prodrazvyorstka|forced grain requisitions]] led to the Soviets emptying out of ordinary people. Half the population of Moscow and a third of Petrograd had by this stage fled to the countryside to find food and political life ground to a halt.&lt;ref name="Marcel Leibman 1980"/&gt;

The Bolsheviks became concerned that under these conditions—the absence of mass participation in political life and the banning of opposition parties—counter-revolutionary forces would express themselves within the Bolshevik Party itself (some evidence existed for this in the mass of ex opposition party members who signed up for Bolshevik membership immediately after the end of the Civil War).

Despite the principle of [[democratic centralism]] in the Bolshevik Party, internal factions were banned. This was considered an extreme measure and did not fall within Marxist doctrine. The ban remained until the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former). Chapter 7—The Communist Party. Democratic Centralism |work=The Library of Congress. Country Studies |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cshome.html| accessdate=October 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, vigorous internal debate and freedom of opinion were still present within Russia and the beginnings of censorship and mass political repression had not yet emerged. For example, the Workers Opposition faction continued to operate despite being nominally dissolved. The debates of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued to be published until 1923.

===Stalinism and "dictatorship"===
Elements of the later censorship and attacks on political expression would appear during Lenin's illness and after his death, when members of the future [[Stalinist]] clique clamped down on party democracy among the Georgian Bolsheviks and began to censor material. ''Pravda'' ceased publishing the opinions of political oppositions after 1924 and at the same time, the ruling clique ([[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]) admitted large numbers of new members into the party in order to shout down the voices of oppositionists at party meetings, severely curtailing internal debate. Their policies were partly directed by the interests of the new bureaucracy that had accumulated a great deal of social weight in the absence of an active participation in politics by the majority of people. By 1927, many supporters of the [[Left Opposition]] began to face political repression and [[Leon Trotsky]] was exiled.

Some modern critics of the concept of the "dictatorship of the proletariat"—including various [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]], [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxists]], [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communists]] and anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[communists]] and [[socialists]]—argue that the Stalinist Soviet Union and other Stalinist countries used the "dictatorship of the proletariat" to justify the monopolisation of political power by a new [[ruling class|ruling layer]] of bureaucrats, derived partly from the old Tsarist bureaucracy and partly created by the impoverished condition of Russia.

However, the rising Stalinist clique rested on other grounds for political legitimacy rather than a confusion between the modern and Marxist use of the term "dictatorship". Rather, they took the line that since they were the vanguard of the proletariat, their right to rule could not be legitimately questioned. Hence, opposition parties could not be permitted to exist. From 1936 onward, Stalinist-inspired state constitutions enshrined this concept by giving the various communist parties a "leading role" in society—a provision that was interpreted to either ban other parties altogether or force them to accept the Stalinists guaranteed right to rule as a condition of being allowed to exist.

This justification was adopted by subsequent communist parties that built upon the Stalinist model, such as the ones in China, North Korea, Vietnam and Cuba (initially the [[26th of July Movement]]).

===Post-Stalin===
At the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|22nd Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] declared an end to the "dictatorship of the proletariat" and the establishment of the "all people's government".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Law | first = David A. | title = Russian Civilization | publisher = Ardent Media | year = 1975 | isbn = 978-0-8422-0529-0 | page = 161 | ref = CITEREFLaw1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Emergency Quota Act''', also known as the '''Emergency Immigration Act of 1921''', the '''Immigration Restriction Act of 1921''', the '''Per Centum Law''', and the '''Johnson Quota Act''' (ch. 8, {{USStat|42|5}} of May 19, 1921) restricted [[Immigration to the United States|immigration into the United States]]. Although intended as temporary legislation, the Act "proved in the long run the most important turning-point in American immigration policy"&lt;ref&gt;John Higham, ''Strangers in the Land'' (1963), 311&lt;/ref&gt; because it added two new features to American immigration law: numerical limits on immigration and the use of a [[Wiktionary:quota|quota]] system for establishing those limits.  These limits came to be known as the [[National Origins Formula]].

The Emergency Quota Act restricted the number of immigrants admitted from any country annually to 3% of the number of residents from that same country living in the United States as of the [[1910 United States Census|U.S. Census of 1910]].&lt;ref&gt;Divine, Robert A. (2007) ''America, Past and Present'', 8th ed., 736&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that people from northern European countries had a higher quota and were more likely to be admitted to the U.S. than people from [[eastern Europe]], [[southern Europe]], or other, non-European countries. Professionals were to be admitted without regard to their country of origin. The Act set no limits on immigration from [[Latin America]]. The act did not apply to countries with bilateral agreements with the US, or to Asian countries listed in the [[Immigration Act of 1917]], known as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act.&lt;ref name="UAWB.edu" /&gt; However, the Act was not seen as restrictive enough since millions of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe had come into the USA since 1890. The Immigration Act of 1924 reduced the Quota to 2% per the Census of 1890 when a fairly small percentage of the population was from the regions regarded as less than desirable.    

Based on that formula, the number of new immigrants admitted fell from 805,228 in 1920 to 309,556 in 1921-22.&lt;ref name=murray7&gt;Robert K. Murray, ''The 103rd Ballot: Democrats and the Disaster in Madison Square Garden'' (NY: Harper &amp; Row, 1976), 7&lt;/ref&gt;   The average annual inflow of immigrants prior to 1921 was 175,983 from Northern and Western Europe, and 685,531 from other countries, principally Southern and [[Eastern Europe]]. In 1921, there was a drastic reduction in immigration levels from other countries, principally Southern and Eastern Europe.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

Following the end of [[World War I]], both Europe and the United States were experiencing economic and social upheaval. In Europe, the destruction of the war, the [[Russian Revolution]], and the dissolution of both the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] led to greater immigration to the United States, while in the United States an economic downturn following post-war [[demobilization]] increased unemployment. The combination of increased immigration from Europe at the time of higher American unemployment strengthened the [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant]] movement.

The act, sponsored by Rep. [[Albert Johnson (congressman)|Albert Johnson]] (R-[[Washington (state)|Washington]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=American Catholic History Classroom |url=http://archives.lib.cua.edu/education/immigration/1921-quota.cfm |title=1921 Emergency Quota Act |accessdate=2012-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121091813/http://archives.lib.cua.edu/education/immigration/1921-quota.cfm |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was passed without a recorded vote in the U.S. House of Representatives and by a vote of 90-2-4 in the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref name=govtrack&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Vote #21 (May 3, 1921)|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=s67_1-21&amp;sort=vote|work=govtrack.us|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was revised by the [[Immigration Act of 1924]].

The use of such a National Origins Formula continued until 1965 when the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] replaced it with a system of preferences based on immigrants' skills and family relationships with U.S. citizens or U.S. residents.

{{Nihongo|'''''Ero kawaii'''''|エロ可愛い||literally "erotic cute"}}, or '''''erokawa''''', is a Japanese subculture that draws on Western notions of sexiness, in contrast to the popular [[Kawaii|cuteness]] (kawaii) trend. The term, coined in 2005, is a fusion of ''ero'' (shortened from the English word "erotic", which has negative connotations in Japanese culture) and the lighter ''[[kawaii]]'', meaning "cute".&lt;ref name=buzz&gt;{{Citation | title = Buzzword: ero-kakkoii | date = 2006-02-22 | url = http://web-jpn.org/trends/buzz/bz0602.html | accessdate = 2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniorb.com/ATREND/Japanwatch/eroticcool.htm|title="Erotic-Cool" Culture in Japan|date=2007-08-08|last=Lee|first=Diana|work=Uniorb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:America First – The Netherlands Second.png|thumb|300px|Original ''[[Zondag met Lubach]]'' parody video, inspiring the ''[[Neo Magazin Royale]]'' team to launch a Europe-wide contest to become 'second'.]]

'''Every Second Counts''' is the name under which a parody video contest amongst [[Europe]]an [[satire|satirical]] [[late-night talk show]]s was launched by [[Germany|German]] comedian [[Jan Böhmermann]]'s ''[[Neo Magazin Royale]]'' on 2 February 2017. The goal is to ridicule U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], especially his [[Inauguration of Donald Trump#Inaugural address|inaugural statement]] that "From this day forward, it's gonna be only America ''first''! America ''first''!" by introducing one's own country with a dose of [[self-deprecation|self-deprecating humour]] and requesting to become 'second' after America.&lt;ref name="strijdt"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/buitenland/in-navolging-van-lubach-strijdt-heel-europa-om-second-te-worden~a4457614/ |title=In navolging van Lubach strijdt heel Europa om 'second' te worden |author=Gijs Beukers |work=[[de Volkskrant]] |date=3 February 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contest was inspired by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] comedian [[Arjen Lubach]]'s show ''[[Zondag met Lubach]]'', which broadcast the parody video "The Netherlands welcomes Trump in his own words" on 22 January 2017.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt; In the video, Trump's speeches and actions –mostly from [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|his election campaign]]– are imitated and mocked by voice actor [[Greg Shapiro]],&lt;ref name="Vanity1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/donald-trump-trolling-videos-america-first-netherlands-second-greg-shapiro-shaun-streeter |title=Meet the Men Trolling Trump in Those Viral European Videos |author=Hillary Busis |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=7 February 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who gives a short description of the Netherlands using some [[self-mockery]] as well, finishing with the request that the Netherlands may come 'second' if America is to be 'first'.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt; A semi-serious undertone is formed by fears that Trump's announced [[America First (policy)|"America First" policy]] signifies [[isolationism]], including withdrawing U.S. support for [[NATO]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/trump-nato/492341/ |title=Donald Trump's NATO Remarks Stuns U.S. Allies |author=Krishnadev Calamur  |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=21 July 2016 |accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If you screw NATO, you're gonna make our problems [[Make America Great Again|great again]]."&lt;ref name="Erickson"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/25/dutch-tv-trolls-donald-trump-hard-in-this-new-welcome-video/ |title=Dutch TV trolls Donald Trump hard in this new ‘welcome’ video |author=Amanda Erickson |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=25 January 2017 |accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video went viral, being discussed by multiple international newsmedia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/24/dutch-tv-trolls-donald-trumps-america-first-speech-welcome-video/ |title=Dutch TV trolls Donald Trump's 'America First' speech in 'welcome' video |author=Mark Molloy |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 January 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/01/26/world/europe/ap-eu-netherlands-viral-video.html |title=Video Introducing Trump to the Netherlands Goes Viral |author=AP |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 January 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaching over 73 million views worldwide by 3 February.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt;

=== Contest launched ===
[[File:America First – Germany Second.png|280px|thumb|[[Jan Böhmermann]] launches the video contest.]]
On 2 February during ''Neo Magazin Royale'', Böhmermann challenged the Dutch's second place, broadcasting a rival video that claimed 'Germany second' whilst making fun of the Netherlands and Germany itself as well. Then, he encouraged other satirical talkshow producers in all [[European countries]] to make similar videos parodying Trump, themselves and challenging the Netherlands' second place behind America.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="binnenkomen"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2156281-varianten-op-lubachs-introductievideo-blijven-binnenkomen.html |title=Varianten op Lubachs introductievideo blijven binnenkomen |work=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] |date=3 February 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production teams in at least eleven other countries committed to making their own parody videos, and by 3 February, versions for [[Belgium]] (by ''De Ideale Wereld''), [[Switzerland]] (by ''Deville Late Night''), [[Denmark]] (by ''Natholdet''), [[Portugal]] (by ''[[5 Para A Meia-Noite]]'') and [[Lithuania]] (by ''Laikykitės ten'') had been released; these would all be gathered on the website everysecondcounts.eu.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="binnenkomen"/&gt; Many of the videos are narrated by voice actor Shaun Streeter, with the exception of the [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan]]ese versions.&lt;ref name="Vanity1"/&gt;

=== Beyond Europe ===
By 6 February, [[Italy]] (by ''Casa Surace''), [[Luxembourg]] (by ''Studio Ben''), and [[Morocco]] (a non-European country, expanding the contest further) had joined the fray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/06/513744676/if-americas-no-1-whos-no-2-european-nations-compete-for-the-uh-honor |title=If America's No. 1, Who's No. 2?

== Common elements ==
[[File:POTUS visits DHS (32174751680).jpg|thumb|The videos make fun of [[Executive Order 13767|Trump's plan to build a Mexican wall]].]]
Though widely varying in contents specific to each country's presentation, and the way in which they criticise and/or ridicule President Trump and his ideas and actions, the videos often share common elements. Many revolve around (sarcastically) taking pride in or mocking their own country's history, and comparing it to Trump's actions or American history in general, and how the latter is better, equal or worse.&lt;ref name="Erickson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sjolin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilhelmer"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://kurier.at/kultur/floete-mit-schoko-hoden-was-an-austria-second-alles-nicht-lustig-war/245.474.681 |title=Flöte mit Schoko-Hoden: Was an "Austria Second" alles nicht lustig war |author=Philipp Wilhelmer |work=[[Kurier]] |date=8 February 2017 |accessdate=10 February 2017 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Group of 33''' was an international grouping that existed briefly in 1999, comprising the thirty-three leading national economies of the world.

It superseded the [[Group of 22]] in early 1999, and was itself superseded by the {{As of|2009|alt=present}} [[G20 industrial nations|Group of 20]] later that year. A number of G33 meetings on the international financial system were held at the initiative of the [[finance minister]]s and [[central bank governor]]s of the [[G8|G7]]. The first meeting was held in [[Bonn, Germany]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/groups.htm#G33 IMF Factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glycerol monostearate''', commonly known as '''GMS''', is an [[monoglyceride]] commonly used as an [[emulsifier]] in foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Food emulsifiers: Surface activity, edibility, manufacture, composition, and application | journal = Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society | volume = 53 | issue = 6 | year = 1976 | pages = 400–407 | author = Jens Birk Lauridsen | doi = 10.1007/BF02605731}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes the form of a white, odorless, and sweet-tasting flaky powder that is [[hygroscopic]]. Chemically it is the [[glycerol]] [[ester]] of [[stearic acid]].

==Structure, synthesis, and occurrence==
Glycerol monostearate exists as three stereoisomers, the enantiomeric pair of 1-glycerol monostearate and 2-glycerol monostearate.  Typically these are encountered as a mixture as many of their properties are similar.

Commercial material used in foods is produced industrially by a [[glycerolysis]] reaction between [[triglycerides]] (from either [[vegetable]] or [[animal]] fats) and glycerol.&lt;ref name="Sonntag1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonntag|first1=Norman O. V.|title=Glycerolysis of fats and methyl esters — Status, review and critique|journal=Journal of the American Oil Chemists Society|volume=59|issue=10|year=1982|pages=795A–802A|issn=0003-021X|doi=10.1007/BF02634442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glycerol monostearate occurs naturally in the body as a product of the breakdown of fats by [[pancreatic lipase]].  It is present at very low levels in certain [[seed oils]].

==Uses==
GMS is a food additive used as a thickening, emulsifying, [[anticaking agent|anticaking]], and preservative agent; an emulsifying agent for oils, waxes, and solvents; a protective coating for hygroscopic powders; a solidifier and control release agent in pharmaceuticals; and a resin lubricant. It is also used in cosmetics and hair-care products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intox.org/databank/documents/chemical/glycmono/cie536.htm Glycerol monostearate] Cheminfo&lt;/ref&gt;

GMS is largely used in baking preparations to add "body" to the food. It is somewhat responsible for giving [[ice cream]] and [[whipped cream]] their smooth texture.  It is sometimes used as an antistaling agent in bread.

The '''Golden Fleet''' ({{lang-sv|Gyllene Flottan}}) was a minor left-wing group in [[Sweden]], existing during the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. It was ideologically aligned with the [[Situationist International]], an [[avant-garde]] revolutionary movement. The Situationists, whose intellectual foundations were derived primarily from [[libertarian Marxism]] and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century (particularly [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plant|first=Sadie|date=1992|title=The Most Radical Gesture|url= |location=[[New York City]]|publisher=Routledge|page= |isbn=978-0-415-06222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially put its emphasis on concepts like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. Gradually the focus moved more towards revolutionary and political theory. Much like the main organ of that particular ideological current, the Situationist International, the Golden Fleet had its heyday around the [[protests of 1968]], gradually disappearing by the first years of the 1970s.

Extremely little is known about the Golden Fleet, yet still it became notorious, this to such an extent that it has been labelled "legendary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Edin|first=Fredrik|date=6 September 2013|title=Den siste situationisten|url=http://arbetaren.se/artiklar/den-sista-situationisten/|newspaper=[[Arbetaren]]|language=Swedish|location=[[Stockholm]]|publisher=[[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]]|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known about its establishment, composition, and disestablishment. The name was most likely taken from an art exhibit in [[Denmark]] by the Situationist [[Jeppesen Victor Martin]], which consisted of geopolitical paintings featuring coastlines, strategic arrows and toy battleships sprayed over with metallic paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slater|first=Howard|date=2001|title=Divided We Stand - An Outline of Scandinavian Situationism|url= |location=[[London]]|publisher=Infopool|page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was centered in the capital [[Stockholm]], although some members appear to have been from [[Gothenburg]]. It is primarily notable through the fact that its members were those that introduced situationist writings to Sweden by its brief but hectic work with publishing political texts. Among them were ''Instruktion i vapendragning'' in 1970 (a translation of "Instructions for an Insurrection", originally published 1961), as well as longer translations of texts by [[Guy Debord]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hyllienmark|first=Olov|date=10 October 1997|title=Jakten på Gyllene Flottan|newspaper=Känguru|language=Swedish|location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also produced a number of works on its own, prominent among them the poster "Hang the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] High" ({{lang-sv|Häng stalinisterna högt}}, on the subject of the contemporary left-wing) and the brochure "King [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Gustaf's]] Sardines" ({{lang-sv|Kung Gustafs sardiner}}) which discussed the "meaningful meaninglessness of the Swedish students". Another Situationist group existed in Sweden, the [[Second Situationist International]] of [[Jørgen Nash]], but there appears to have been no connection between the Golden Fleet and the Nashists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4311">'''High performance sport''' or '''elite sport''' is sport at the highest level of competition. 
In [[sports administration]] "high performance sport", where the emphasis is on winning prestigious competitions, is distinguished from "mass sport" or "[[recreation]]al sport", where the emphasis is on attracting the maximum number of participants.

High performance sport overlaps with [[professional sport]] but is not the same; for example, the [[English football league system]] and [[Minor League Baseball]] include lower divisions whose teams' members are full-time professionals. On the other hand, elite competitors at the [[Olympic Games]] or [[World Games]] in some minority sports may be part-time or rely on government grants. Likewise, [[student athlete]]s, especially in [[college sports]], are often high performance despite being amateurs.

Much research in [[sports psychology]] and [[sports medicine]] is motivated by the needs of elite rather than mass athletes. [[Doping in sport]] is more common at elite levels, and research into [[performance-enhancing substance]]s has been fuelled by the drive for success.

Separate state agencies may be responsible for high performance sport and for mass sport; [[Sports governing body|national governing bodies]] for a particular sport often have separate administrative units for supporting élite athletes and for administering mass competitions. [[National Olympic Committee]]s are often concerned with high performance sport, including the funding of athletes likely to win [[Olympic medal]]s. In [[public policy]], funding for high performance sport may be justified for reasons of national prestige or as a marketing tool for encouraging mass sport. [[Eastern bloc]] countries invested in elite sport during the [[Cold War]]; Western countries began establishing '''Institutes of Sport''' for a similar purpose from the 1980s, with '''sports academies''' for nurturing promising young athletes. Such institutes may set goals in terms of national ranking on the [[Olympic medal table]].

The '''International Association of Women Police''' (IAWP) is a global organization for women in criminal justice professions. Its mission is to "strengthen, unite and raise the profile of women in criminal justice internationally."&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About IAWP|url=http://iawp.wildapricot.org/Default.aspx?pageId=1447867|publisher=International Association of Women Police|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and Vision==
According to the [http://www.iawp.org/ IAWP website], its mission, as stated in [http://www.iawp.org/about.htm#Constitution Article III], is to “strengthen, unite and raise the profile of women in criminal justice internationally”. Its vision is to ensure that “women’s lives [are] free from discrimination, valued for their contribution, and treated with respect and dignity.  To contribute by being an example of excellence in securing a safe, harmonious workplace and society as partners in safety in the criminal justice system”. These core beliefs and objectives encompass the main message of the [http://www.iawp.org/ International Association of Women Police], and focus on standing up for the [[equal treatment]] that each woman on the [[police force]] deserves.

==History==
[http://www.iawp.org/ The International Policewomen's Association] was founded in 1915. [[Alice Stebbins Wells]], the first policewoman in the [[United States]], was appointed the association's first president. Its charter was adopted in 1916 in [[Washington, D.C.]] From 1919–1932, the president of the association was [[Mina Van Winkle]]. After her death, the association dwindled. It was not until 1956 that the association was revived at a meeting of the [[Women Peace Officers of California]], where it was renamed the International Association of Women Police.&lt;ref name=finding&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of the International Association of Women Police Finding Aid|url=http://guides.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/content.php?pid=227219&amp;sid=2654624|publisher=Lloyd Sealy Library Special Collections, John Jay College of Criminal Justice|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief History|url=http://www.iawp.org/history/historyoftheIAWP.htm|publisher=International Association of Women Police|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lois Higgins]], a veteran of the [[Chicago Police Department]], was elected the association's president, and under her leadership the [http://www.iawp.org/ IAWP] grew in strength and numbers. The organization fought [[discrimination]] against women in the [[police force]] and opposed separate women’s bureaus within police departments.&lt;ref name=finding /&gt;

The Records of the [http://www.iawp.org/ International Association of Women Police] are housed in the Lloyd Sealy Library Special Collections, [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]].&lt;ref name=finding /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manuscript Collections|url=http://guides.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/content.php?pid=227219&amp;sid=2654624|publisher=Lloyd Sealy Library Special Collections at John Jay College of Criminal Justice|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes for Formation==
As Stated in its Mission and Vision Statements, [http://www.iawp.org/ The International Association of Women Police] came to be in order to fight against the [[discrimination]] of women on [[police forces]] across the world. Fighting against cases of [[sexual harassment]], limited job opportunities, and [[discriminatory]] treatment from male colleagues have all been key reasons for catalyzing the formation of an organization that promotes the [[equal treatment]] of women on the [[police force]]. The [http://www.iawp.org/ IAWP] also works to ensure that women are satisfied with their careers on the force, and to make sure they do not feel powerless or unappreciated in their line of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dantzker|first=M.L.|author2=Betsy Kubin|title=JOB SATISFACTION: The Gender Perspective Among Police Officers|journal=American Journal of Criminal Justice|year=1998|volume=23|issue=1|pages=19–31|doi=10.1007/bf02887282}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the [http://www.iawp.org/ IAWP] was formed in order to promote equality among the sexes in the [[police force]] and to ensure the equal treatment, equal pay, and equal protection of women who chose a career in the [[criminal justice system]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Jennifer|title=Aspects of Discriminatory Treatment of Women Police Officers Serving in Forces in England and Wales|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|year=1998|volume=38|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harassment==
The [http://www.iawp.org/ IAWP] promotes the idea that female officers should not live in fear of [[harassment]], and should be treated with [[respect]] and fairness from each of their coworkers. The members of this organization work to deconstruct the social stigmas that follow women on to the [[police force]]. Sanda K. Wells and Betty L. Alt discuss the many forms of harassment in their book “Police Women: Life With a Badge. They discuss how one of the most common occurrences on the force is the issue of [[harassment]]. [[Sexual harassment]] and a hostile environment are most commonly dealt with. Wells and Alt go on the define the forms of [[harassment]]; [[sexual harassment]] encompasses unwanted sexual advances such as requesting [[sexual acts]], or promising a promotion or pay raise in return for a sexual favor. A hostile environment involves any act that unwanted and may have a negative effect on the person being acted against and their job performance. This may be in the form of offensive or rude remarks about a person’s body or gender. According to their book, anyone is capable of [[harassment]]; it is not limited to just men harassing women. Other forms of [[harassment]] involve inappropriate touching, remarks about one’s body, and offensive remarks that degrade the individual. According to Women and Policing News Wire, 80 percent of women on the police force have encountered or been a victim of harassment on the job. Wells and Alt go on to say that few women feel the need to report the colleagues that harass them and usually let the harassment slide, due to the fact that many women who report their harassment end up being accused of various crimes such as drug abuse, child abuse, receive death threats, and fail to receive backup when they call for it. ”&lt;ref name="Wells, Alt 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells, Alt|first=Sandra, Betty|title=Police Women: Life With the Badge|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination==
One of the main goals that the [http://www.iawp.org/ IAWP] prides itself on is the abolishment of [[discrimination]] of women on the [[police force]]. One of the main forms of [[discrimination]], as discussed in Well’s and Alt’s book “Police Women: Life With a Badge” is gender [[harassment]]. For example, not being provided a separate place from men in order to change into the work uniform is defined as a form of discrimination. One case mentioned encompasses a women officer who that had been on the force for years was not given a locker or changing space, yet a rookie male cop who had just joined the force was given a locker as soon as he entered the [[police force]]. This is means for investigation on the [[discrimination]] that women face. “Police Women: Life With a Badge” also goes on to talk about women police officers that become [[pregnant]] during their time on the force. Not being given lighter duties due to [[pregnancy]] is also an issue that some [[police officer|policewomen]] must face. [[Pregnancy]] may hinder movement and other physical activity on the job, and not being given enough time to recuperate after having a child may result in a decrease in [[job performance]]. Because of this, some employees see this as grounds to [[discriminate]] against [[pregnant]] coworkers, and some agencies fail to provide basic rights such as [[maternity]] uniforms or leave benefits for these [[police officer|police women]].&lt;ref name="Wells, Alt 2005"/&gt;

==Limited Job Opportunities==
The [http://www.iawp.org/ IAWP] prides itself on equality, and ensuring that women are presented equal opportunities in their [[career]] is one of its many focusses. An issue discussed in “Police Women: Life With a Badge” are the limited job opportunities that may follow women through the [[criminal justice]] [[career]] path. For example, a women may only be given duties involving [[child abuse]], [[sex crimes]], and [[domestic abuse]] and not be given the chance to participate in more intensive cases that are deemed “more masculine” such as [[gang]] related [[violence]] or [[murder]]. Women may also not be given the same opportunities as [[men]] when it comes to issues such as [[Promotion (rank)|promotions]] and chances to further themselves in the [[criminal justice]] [[career]]. Forms of discipline also seem to have [[Gender inequality|inequalities]] on the [[police force]]; where a [[woman]] may receive [[punishment]], a [[man]] seems to receive none. Women are also dealt harsher [[punishments]] than [[men]] on the [[police force]]. There is also the concern that women are held to a different standard than [[men]] on the job. There are different expectations for women to fulfill on performance evaluations and are expected to perform differently overall than [[men]], and not fulfilling these expectations may hinder them from having a successful [[career]]. Lastly, women tend to not receive equal consideration for special training and important assignments as [[men]]. While a male officer may be asked to go on a special assignment, a female officer may be forced to handle less serious matters.&lt;ref name="Wells, Alt 2005"/&gt;

==Equal Treatment==
All across the [[world]], efforts are being made to ensure the [[equal treatment]] of women is being reached. This is especially noticeable in countries such as [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]], and [[Catalonia]]. For the most part few women participate in [[policing]] in [[Europe]], and still have a difficult time receiving the same treatment as [[men]], however, according to Tanja Van Der Lippe, Anne Graumans, and Selma Sevenhuijsen, authors of “Gender Policies and the Position of Women in the Police Force in European Countries,” inequalities may still exist now, but at the rate of how things are changing, it is more than possible to change the [[social norms]] that have been engrained into the minds of people on the [[police force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Der Lippe, Graumans, Sevenhuijsen|first=Tanja, Anne, Selma|title=Gender Policies and the Position of Women in the Police Force in European Countries|journal=Van Der Lippe, Tanja, Anne Graumans, and Selma Sevenhuijsen. "Gender Policies and the Position of Women in the Police Force in European Countries." Journal of European Social Policy|year=2004|volume=14|issue=4|pages=391–405|doi=10.1177/0958928704046880}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [http://www.iawp.org/ IAWP] has an intense focus on this area, and works to promote fairness amongst both men and women that hold [[careers]] in the [[criminal justice]] system.

[[File:Police officers of Poland (3).JPG|thumb|Mounted policewomen in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=File:Police officers of Poland (3).JPG|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Police_officers_of_Poland_(3).JPG|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Prostitution Stings==
Women [[police offices]] have also been subject to one form or [[police work]] that has been deemed questionable by many: [[prostitution]] stings. According to Mary Dodge, Donna Starr-Gimeno, and Thomas Williams, authors of “Puttin’ on the Sting: Women Police Officers' Perspectives on Reverse Prostitution Assignments,” [[prostitution]] stings may both endanger the lives of women officers or may degrade them. This journal article mentions how women who take up this position may be objectified by male coworkers. It also offers important insight as to how [[sting operations]] may endanger and humiliate women, while men who participate in such operations do not face these consequences. Many [[police]] women feel as if they are being used for their bodies, and feel repulsed by the idea that they are acting as nothing more than an object in order to detain a man that is willing to pay for [[sex]]. There is also a sense of humiliation that goes along with this process; if the [[police]] woman is approached by a man willing to pay for [[sexual favors]], that in itself may feel wrong and inappropriate to some women. However, on the opposite end of the spectrum, if a [[police]] woman is not approached or asked for her services, her colleagues may make fun of her for not being able to pick anyone up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodge, Starr-Gimeno, Williams|first=Mary, Donna, Thomas|title=Puttin’ on the Sting: Women Police Officers' Perspectives on Reverse Prostitution Assignments|journal=International Journal of Police Science &amp; Management|year=2005|volume=7|issue=2|pages=71–85|doi=10.1350/ijps.7.2.71.65778}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various Stresses on the Force==
The [[discrimination]] and [[harassment]] that may follow some women police offices often leads to many detrimental effects. One of these is strain and stress that is encountered on the job. Not only does unequal treatment lead to stress, but a job on the [[police force]] in general may be stressful. According to Leanor Johnson, author of “Job Strain Among Police Officers: Gender Comparisons,” women may begin to feel so stressed from the job that they begin to feel burned out and useless; they feel as if they are not making a difference in the world. Men on the other hand begin to treat citizens as with disrespect and disregard them entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Leanor B|title=Job Strain among Police Officers: Gender Comparisons|journal=Police Studies: The International Review of Police Development|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both men and women may handle stress in various ways, there may be some benefits coming from this. Each gender handles the different emotional stresses that may be encountered on the job, thus allowing a wide range of ways in which handling crime can be dealt with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Susan E.|title=Police Force or Police Service? Gender and Emotional Labor|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1999|volume=561|issue=1|pages=278–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAWP makes it known that women are quite capable of handling various difficulties that will appear on the job, and though stress may be difficult to manage, it is not impossible.

==Benefits Resulting From Women Police Officers==
In recent years, women on the [[police force]] have been found to have positive effects on society as a whole. [[TIME Magazine]] goes on to talk about the recent hiring of women [[police officers]] in [[Mexico City]], and provides insight given from police chief Carlos Ortega Carpinteyro: “women are more trustworthy and take their oath of office more seriously, they don’t ask for or take [[bribes]].” This goes on to show how women are making vital contributions in [[developing countries]] and how the [[police force]] is only becoming stronger due to the number of women that dedicate their lives to the [[criminal justice system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Madison|title=How to Curb Police Corruption: Hire More Female Cops.|newspaper=TIME Magazine|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By incorporating women into the [[police force]] and acknowledging the fact that they can make a difference, the [http://www.iawp.org/ IAWP] is fulfilling its duty of ensuring that women are being given the equal opportunity to work just as much as men in the [[criminal justice system]]. Barbara Sims, Kathryn E. Scarborough and Janice Ahmad also have quite a bit to say about this topic. These authors of “The Relationship between Police Officers' Attitudes Toward Women and Perceptions of Police” go on to say that if women are fully appreciated on the police force, then the benefit of society is sure to follow. Fighting [[sexism]] would, overall, promote the growth and success of [[society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sims, Scarborough, Ahmad|first=Barbara, Kathryn E., Janice|title=The Relationship Between Police Officers’ Attitudes Toward Women and Perceptions of Police Models|journal=Police Quarterly|year=2003|volume=6|issue=3|pages=278–297|doi=10.1177/1098611103254315}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women Sheriffs and Police Chiefs==
The [[iawp.org|IAWP’s]] main goal is to empower women all across the world. One way women are able to do this is by working their way up to important roles on the police force such as [[sheriff]] or [[police chief]]. In the book “Breaking the Brass Ceiling: Women Police Chiefs and Their Way to the Top,” author Dorothy Moses Shulz discusses the struggles that women are faced with in order to reach the top in their [[criminal justice]] [[career]]. Difficulties such as [[sexism]] and lack of faith in their abilities may hinder some women from attempting to have careers in these positions. Though the journey may be difficult for women in this field, Shulz goes on to say that it is definitely not impossible for a women to reach the top of this career path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schulz|first=Dorothy M.|title=Breaking the Brass Ceiling: Women Police Chiefs and Their Paths to the Top|year=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Recent Years==
In the organization’s recent years, the number of women joining the [http://iawp.org/ IAWP] has grown, and has not just been limited to women. Men that support the rights of women on the [[police force]] have also been taking part in the [http://iawp.org/ IAWP], and since 1976 male officers have been a part of this organization. In order to spread the word of this group, there have been numerous conferences at various universities and other professional organizations in order to promote the growth and development of the [http://iawp.org/ IAWP].  These conferences have sparked the attention of many different experts in the field of [[criminal justice]], as well as increase awareness of women working to further themselves in this field. Due to the dramatic increase in female members in the [[criminal justice system]], the [http://iawp.org/ IAWP] has only become more influential and helpful in promoting women across [[international borders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IAWP A Brief History of the Organization from 1915 to Present|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The IAWP holds annual training conferences in major international cities, featuring invited speakers and exhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Events|url=http://iawp.wildapricot.org/Default.aspx?pageId=1439378|publisher=International Association of Women Police|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association offers an international scholarship under the [http://www.iawp.org/awards/internationalscholar_award.htm IAWP Scholarship Program].  An officer outside of the United States is selected to attend the Annual Training Conference at no expense to the Officer or her police organization.  The IAWP also offers prestigious international awards in policing under the [http://www.iawp.org/awards.htm IAWP Awards Program].  Nominations for each of the categories are solicited and awarded annually on an international basis.  The International Association of Women Police is the only non-profit organization to offer international recognition for women in the law enforcement professions.

== Regions and Areas Covered ==
The IAWP has a total of 26 regions where there are coordinators for people to contact.  Within each region there is at least one coordinator's email linked onto the official IAWP website.  There are coordinators in various states of the US, and all throughout Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean. To find a coordinator closest to any region/location an individual may find thelist on the IAWP official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iawp.wildapricot.org/page-1849859|title=IAWP Regional Coordinators|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, Between His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America''', commonly known as the '''Jay Treaty''', and also as '''Jay's Treaty''', was a 1795 treaty between the United States and Great Britain that averted war,  resolved issues remaining since the [[Treaty of Paris of 1783]] (which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[#estes2006|Estes, 2006]], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and facilitated ten years of peaceful trade between the United States and Britain in the midst of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], which began in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Edward Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The Treaty was designed by [[Alexander Hamilton]] and supported by President [[George Washington]]. It angered France and bitterly divided Americans. It inflamed the new growth of two opposing parties in every state, the pro-Treaty [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] and the anti-Treaty [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic Republicans]].

The Treaty was negotiated by [[John Jay]] and gained many of the primary American goals. This included the withdrawal of British Army units from forts in the [[Northwest Territory]] that it had refused to relinquish under the Paris Peace Treaty. The British were retaliating for the United States reneging on Articles 4 and 6 of the 1783 treaty; American state courts impeded the collection of debts owed British creditors and upheld the continued confiscation of Loyalist estates in spite of an explicit understanding that the prosecutions would be immediately discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760–1815'' (2007) p. 438&lt;/ref&gt; The parties agreed that disputes over wartime debts and the [[Canada–United States border|American–Canadian boundary]] were to be sent to [[arbitration]]—one of the first major uses of arbitration in modern diplomatic history. This set a precedent used by other nations. The Americans were granted limited rights to trade with British colonies in the [[Caribbean]] in exchange for some limits on the American export of cotton.

The Jay treaty was signed on November 19, 1794, and submitted to the [[United States Senate]] for its advice and consent the following June. It was ratified by the Senate on June 24, 1795 by a [[two-thirds majority]] vote of 20–10 (the exact number necessary for concurrence). It was also ratified by the [[Tory government, 1783–1801|British government]], and [[Coming into force|took effect]] February 29, 1796, the day when ratifications were officially exchanged.

The treaty was hotly contested by [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]] in each state. An effort was made to block it in the House, which ultimately failed. The Jeffersonians feared that closer economic or political ties with Great Britain would strengthen Hamilton's [[Federalist Party]], promote [[aristocracy]], and undercut [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]. This debate crystallized the emerging partisan divisions and shaped the new "[[First Party System]]", with the Federalists favoring the British and the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian republicans]] favoring France. The treaty was for ten years' duration. Efforts failed to agree on a replacement treaty in 1806 when Jefferson rejected the [[Monroe–Pinkney Treaty]], as tensions escalated toward the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Smelser, ''The Democratic Republic: 1801–1815'' (1968) pp. 139, 145, 155–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
[[File:John Jay (Gilbert Stuart portrait).jpg|thumb|right|200px|John Jay, chief American negotiator]]
The outbreak of war between France and Great Britain (and other countries) in 1793 ended the long peace that had enabled the new nation to flourish in terms of trade and finance. The United States now emerged as an important neutral country with a large shipping trade.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Flagg Bemis, ''Jay's Treaty: A Study in Commerce and Diplomacy'' (1923) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; From the British perspective, improving relations with the United States was a high priority lest it move into the French orbit. British negotiators ignored elements that wanted harsher terms in order to get a suitable treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins (1955) pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; From the American viewpoint, the most pressing foreign policy issues were normalizing the trade relations with Britain, the United States' leading trading partner, and resolving issues left over from the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. As one observer explained, the British government was "well disposed to America. ... They have made their arrangements upon a plan that comprehends the neutrality of the United States, and are anxious that it should be preserved."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gouverneur Morris]] quoted in Perkins (1955) p. 22; the British foreign minister felt, "this Country is anxious to keep the Americans in good humour". Perkins (1955) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Without warning American officials, the British government used the [[Royal Navy]] to capture nearly 250 neutral American merchant ships carrying goods from French colonies in the West Indies. Americans were outraged and Republicans in Jefferson's coalition demanded a declaration of war, but [[James Madison]] instead called for an embargo on trade with Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerald A. Combs|title=The Jay Treaty: Political Battleground of the Founding Fathers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jyo5nJ1znwC&amp;pg=PA120|year=1970|publisher=U of California Press|page=120|isbn=9780520015739}}&lt;/ref&gt; British officials told [[First Nations]] near the Canada–U.S. border that the border no longer existed and sold weapons to them.

At the national level American politics was divided between the factions of Jefferson and Madison, which favored the French, and the Federalists led by Hamilton, who saw Britain as a natural ally and thus sought to normalize relations with Britain, especially in the area of trade. Washington sided with Hamilton. Hamilton devised a framework for negotiations, and President George Washington sent [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice of the Supreme Court]] John Jay to London to negotiate a comprehensive treaty.

The American government had several outstanding issues:&lt;ref&gt;Bemis, ''Jay's Treaty: A Study in Commerce and Diplomacy'' (1923) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The British were occupying forts on [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|U.S. territory]] in the Great Lakes region, at [[Detroit]] and [[Fort Mackinac|Mackinac]] in modern-day Michigan, [[Fort Niagara|Niagara]] and [[Fort Ontario|Oswego]] in New York, and [[Fort Miami (Ohio)|Maumee]] (also Miamis) in modern-day Ohio. Britain said it was in response to American refusals to pay debts that had been agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Richard Carstens|title=Searching For the Forgotten War – 1812: United States of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SX8Y71-dQHkC&amp;pg=PT178|year=2011|publisher=Xlibris|page=178|isbn=9781456867553}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

* American merchants wanted compensation for 250 merchant ships which the British had confiscated in 1793 and 1794.
* Southern interests wanted monetary compensation for slaves owned by Loyalists who were taken away to the West Indies along with their masters in 1781–83.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis D.

==Treaty terms==
Both sides achieved many objectives. Several issues were sent to arbitration, which (after years of discussion) were resolved amicably mostly in favor of the U.S. Britain paid $11,650,000 for damages to American shipping and received £600,000 for unpaid pre-1775 debts. While international arbitration was not entirely unknown, the Jay Treaty gave it a strong impetus and is generally taken as the start of modern international arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Bailey, ''A Diplomatic History of the American People'' (10th Ed. 1980) pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British agreed to vacate its forts in United States territory—six in the [[Great Lakes region]] and two at the north end of [[Lake Champlain]]—by June 1796; which was done. They were:

The treaty was "surprisingly generous" in allowing Americans to trade with Great Britain on a most-favored-nation basis.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the United States gave [[most favored nation]] trading status to Britain, and acquiesced in British anti-French maritime policies. American merchants obtained limited rights to trade in the British West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne S. Cole, ''An Interpretive History of American Foreign Relations'', (1974) p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Two joint boundary commissions were set up to establish the boundary line in the Northeast (it agreed on one) and in the Northwest (this commission never met and the boundary was settled after the War of 1812).&lt;ref&gt;The Treaty also allowed people to pass freely across the US-Canada border to carry on trade and commerce.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay, a strong opponent of slavery, dropped the issue of compensation for slaves, which angered Southern slaveholders and was used as a target for attacks by Jeffersonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=Slavery and the Founders: Race and Liberty in the Age of Jefferson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j3hsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172|year=2014|pages=171–72|isbn=9781317520252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay was unsuccessful in negotiating an end to the [[impressment]] of American sailors into the Royal Navy, which later became a key issue leading to the [[War of 1812]].

===American Indian rights===
Article III states, "It is agreed, that it shall at all times be free to His Majesty's subjects, and to the citizens of the United States, and also to the Indians dwelling on either side of the said boundary line, freely to pass and repass, by land or inland navigation into the respective territories and countries of the two parties on the continent of America, (the [[Rupert's Land|country within the limits of the Hudson's Bay Company]] only excepted) ... and freely carry on trade and commerce with each other." Article III of the Jay Treaty declared the right of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], American citizens, and Canadian subjects to trade and travel between the United States and Canada, which was then a territory of Great Britain.&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=indian&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001359----000-.html  INA], Cornell.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years since, the United States has codified this obligation in the provisions of Section 289 of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] and [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|as amended in 1965]]. As a result of the Jay Treaty, "Native Indians born in Canada are therefore entitled to enter the United States for the purpose of employment, study, retirement, investing, and/or immigration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consular.canada.usembassy.gov/first_nations_canada.asp|title=First Nations and Native Americans|publisher=United States Embassy, Consular Services Canada|accessdate=March 3, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422211236/http://www.consular.canada.usembassy.gov/first_nations_canada.asp|archivedate=April 22, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article III of the Jay Treaty is the basis of most Indian claims.&lt;ref&gt;Karl S. Hele, ''Lines Drawn upon the Water: First Nations and the Great Lakes Borders and Borderlands'' (2008) p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approval and dissent==
[[File:ThomasJeffersonStateRoomPortrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Thomas Jefferson]] was harshly critical of the treaty.]]
Washington submitted the treaty to the [[United States Senate]] for its consent in June 1795; a two-thirds vote was needed. The treaty was unpopular at first and gave the Jeffersonians a platform to rally new supporters. As historian Paul Varg explains,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Jay Treaty was a reasonable give-and-take compromise of the issues between the two countries. What rendered it so assailable was not the compromise spelled out between the two nations but the fact that it was not a compromise between the two political parties at home. Embodying the views of the Federalists, the treaty repudiated the foreign policy of the opposing party.&lt;ref&gt;Varg, 1963 p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Jeffersonians were opposed to Britain, preferring support for France in the wars raging in Europe, and they argued that the treaty with France from 1778 was still in effect. They considered Britain as the center of aristocracy and the chief threat to the United States' Republican values. They denounced Hamilton and Jay (and even Washington) as monarchists who betrayed American values. They organized public protests against Jay and his treaty; one of their rallying cries said: ''Damn John Jay! Damn everyone that won't damn John Jay! Damn every one that won't put lights in his window and sit up all night damning John Jay!''&lt;ref&gt;William Weeks, ''Building the Continental Empire'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty was one of the major catalysts for the advent of the [[First Party System]] in the United States by further dividing the two major political factions within the country. The [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]], led by Hamilton, supported the treaty. On the contrary, the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]], led by Jefferson and Madison, opposed it. Jefferson and his supporters had a counter-proposal to establish "a direct system of commercial hostility with Great Britain," even at the risk of war. The Jeffersonians raised public opinion to fever pitch by accusing the British of promoting Indian atrocities on the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins and McKitrick, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; The fierce debates over the Treaty in 1794–95, according to one historian, "transformed the Republican movement into a Republican party." To fight the treaty, the Jeffersonians "established coordination in activity between leaders at the capital, and leaders, actives and popular followings in the states, counties and towns."&lt;ref&gt;William Nisbet Chambers. ''Political Parties in a New Nation: The American Experience, 1776–1809'' (1963), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jay's failure to obtain compensation for "lost" slaves galvanized the South into opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy'' (2006) 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federalists fought back and Congress rejected the Jefferson–Madison counter-proposals. Washington threw his great prestige behind the treaty, and Federalists rallied public opinion more effectively than did their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#estes2001|Estes, 2001]], pp. 127–158&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton convinced President Washington that it was the best treaty that could be expected. Washington insisted that the U.S. must remain neutral in the European wars; he signed it, and his prestige carried the day in Congress. The Federalists made a strong, systematic appeal to public opinion, which rallied their own supporters and shifted the debate. Washington and Hamilton outmaneuvered Madison, who was opposition leader.&lt;ref&gt;[[#estes2000|Estes, 2000]], pp. 398–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton by then was out of the government, and he was the dominant figure who helped secure the treaty's approval by the needed 2/3 vote in the Senate. The Senate passed a resolution in June, advising the President to amend the treaty by suspending the 12th article, which concerned trade between the U.S. and the West Indies. In mid-August, the Senate ratified the treaty 20–10, with the condition that the treaty contain specific language regarding the June 24 resolution.  President Washington signed it in late August. The Treaty was proclaimed in effect on February 29, 1796 and the House funded it{{clarify|reason=why did a treaty require funding?|date=November 2018}} in April 1796, in a series of close votes and after another bitter fight.&lt;ref name = "AFR"&gt;[http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/A-D/Arbitration-Mediation-and-Conciliation-Jay-s-treaty-and-the-treaty-of-ghent.html "Jay’s Treaty"], American Foreign Relations.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Madison, then a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], argued that the treaty could not, under Constitutional law, take effect without approval of the House, since it regulated commerce and exercised legislative powers granted to Congress. The debate which followed was an early example of [[originalism]], in which Madison, the "Father of the Constitution," lost.&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, pp. 355–65&lt;/ref&gt;  One interesting feature of this nationwide constitutional debate was an [[Advisory opinion#United States|advisory opinion]] on the subject written by Chief Justice [[Oliver Ellsworth]], in which he rejected any alleged right of the House of Representatives to decide upon the merits of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Casto, William. [http://repository.law.ttu.edu/bitstream/handle/10601/476/casto11.pdf?sequence=1 "Two Advisory Opinions by Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth"], ''[[The Green Bag]]'', Vol. 6, p. 413 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  After defeat on the treaty in Congress, the Jeffersonian Republicans lost the [[1796 US presidential election|1796 presidential election]] on the issue.

When [[Thomas Jefferson]] became president in 1801, he did not repudiate the treaty. He kept the Federalist minister, [[Rufus King]], in London to negotiate a successful resolution to outstanding issues regarding cash payments and boundaries. The amity broke down when the treaty expired in 1805. Jefferson rejected a renewal of the Jay Treaty in the [[Monroe–Pinkney Treaty]] of 1806 as negotiated by his diplomats and agreed to by London. Relations turned increasingly hostile as a prelude to the [[War of 1812]].  In 1815, the [[Treaty of Ghent]] superseded the Jay treaty.

==Evaluations==
Historians [[Stanley Elkins]] and [[Eric McKitrick]] note that, in conventional diplomatic terms and as a "piece of adversary bargaining", Jay "got much the worst of the 'bargain'. Such a view has to a great degree persisted ever since."&lt;ref&gt;Elkins and McKitrick&lt;/ref&gt; They conclude that Jay did not succeed in asserting neutral rights, but he did obtain "his other ''sine qua nons''"; he got none of things that were "desirable, but not indispensable."&lt;ref&gt;Elkins and McKitrick, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; They add that Jay's record on the symbolic side was open to many objections. However, on the "hard" (or realistic) side, "it was a substantial success, which included the prevention of war with Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elkins and McKitrick|title=The Age of Federalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RekybjkpCj4C&amp;pg=PA412|page=412|isbn=9780199796052|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Marshall Smelser argues that the treaty effectively postponed war with Britain, or at least postponed it until the United States was strong enough to handle it.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Smelser, ''The Democratic Republic, 1801–1815'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bradford Perkins (historian)|Bradford Perkins]] argued in 1955 that the treaty was the first to establish a [[special relationship]] between Britain and the United States, with a second installment under [[Lord Salisbury]]. In his view, the treaty worked for ten years to secure peace between Britain and America: "The decade may be characterized as the period of 'The First Rapprochement.'" As Perkins concludes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;For about ten years there was peace on the frontier, joint recognition of the value of commercial intercourse, and even, by comparison with both preceding and succeeding epochs, a muting of strife over ship seizures and impressment. Two controversies with France ... pushed the English-speaking powers even more closely together.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Starting at swords' point in 1794, the Jay treaty reversed the tensions, Perkins concludes: "Through a decade of world war and peace, successive governments on both sides of the Atlantic were able to bring about and preserve a cordiality which often approached genuine friendship."&lt;ref&gt;Perkins p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Perkins suggests that, except perhaps the opening of trade with British India, "Jay did fail to win anything the Americans were not obviously entitled to, liberation of territory recognized as theirs since 1782, and compensation for seizures that even Britain admitted were illegal". He also speculates that a "more astute negotiator than the Chief Justice" would have gotten better terms than he did.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins: ''The First Rapprochement'' p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He quoted the opinion of "great historian" [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]] that the treaty was a "bad one":

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one would venture on its merits to defend it now. There has been no time since 1810 when the United States would not prefer war to peace on such terms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perkins gave more weight than other historians to valuable concessions regarding trade in India and the concession on the West Indies trade.  In addition, Perkins noted that the Royal Navy treated American commerce with "relative leniency" during the wars, and many impressed seamen were returned to America. As Spain assessed the informal British-American alliance, it softened its previous opposition to the United States' use of the [[Mississippi River]] and signed [[Pinckney's Treaty]], which the Americans wanted. When Jefferson took office, he gained renewal of the commercial articles that had greatly benefited American shipping.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, ''Cambridge History of American Foreign Relations I: The Creation of a Republican Empire,''(1995) pp. 99–100, 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elkins and McKitrick find this more positive view open to "one big difficulty": it requires that the British negotiated in the same spirit. Unlike Perkins, they find "little indication of this"&lt;!--- following hidden because it is incomprehensible: ; preferring to view the British not as future-oriented, but, having had no indication that the United States required attention, wishing to take it off the long list of issues that did---&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins and McKitrick, pp. 396–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Herring's 2008 history of US foreign policy says that, in 1794, "the United States and Britain edged toward war" and concludes, "The Jay Treaty brought the United States important concessions and served its interests well."&lt;ref&gt;George Herring, ''From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776'' (2008) pp. 73, 78&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Ellis finds the terms of the treaty "one-sided in Britain's favor," but asserts with a consensus of historians that it was

&lt;blockquote&gt;a shrewd bargain for the United States. It bet, in effect, on England rather than France as the hegemonic European power of the future, which proved prophetic. It recognized the massive dependence of the American economy on trade with England. In a sense it was a precocious preview of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] (1823), for it linked American security and economic development to the British fleet, which provided a protective shield of incalculable value throughout the nineteenth century. Mostly, it postponed war with England until America was economically and politically more capable of fighting one.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Ellis, ''Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation'' (2000) pp. 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the [[HBO]] miniseries ''[[John Adams (miniseries)|John Adams]]'', Vice President [[John Adams]] is shown casting the [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents of the United States|tiebreaker vote]] in favor of ratifying the Jay Treaty. In reality, his vote was never required as the Senate passed the resolution by 20-10. Furthermore, the Vice President would never be required to cast a vote in a treaty ratification, because the Vice President votes only in case of a tie, and Article II of the Constitution requires that treaties receive a two-thirds vote for approval.

The '''Latgalian Farmer-Labour Party''', also known as the '''Latgalian Progressive Farmers''', was a political party in [[Latvia]] during the inter-war period. The party contested elections in an alliance with several other parties under the name '''United List of Latgalian Small Landless Farmers and Latgalian Labour Party'''.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1130 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was led by [[Jezups Trasuns]].&lt;ref name=VM/&gt;

==History==
The party first contested national elections in 1922, when it won four seats in the [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1922|parliamentary elections]] that year. It was reduced to two seats in [[2nd Saeima]] after [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1925|1925 elections]], but won three seats in the [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1928|1928 elections]]. The [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1931|1931 elections]] saw the party win five seats in the [[4th Saeima]].

==Ideology==
The party supported radical land reform, including land distribution without compensation for former landowners. Like other parties in [[Latgale]], it took an anti-[[Poland|Polish]] stance.&lt;ref name=VM&gt;Vincent E McHale (1983) ''Political parties of Europe'', Greenwood Press, p449 {{ISBN|0-313-23804-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20647">'''Legacy preference''' or '''legacy admission''' is a preference given by an institution or organization to certain applicants on the basis of their familial relationship to [[alumni]] of that institution, with college admissions being the field in which legacy preferences are most controversially used. (Students so admitted are referred to as '''legacies''' or '''legacy students'''.) Legacy admissions are almost wholly confined to colleges and universities in the United States and are virtually unheard of in post-secondary institutions in other countries around the world.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Legacy preferences in elite college and university admissions in the U.S. are widespread: almost three-quarters of research universities and nearly all liberal arts colleges grant legacy preferences in admissions.&lt;ref&gt;Richard D. Kahlenberg, "Introduction," ''Affirmative Action for the Rich: Legacy Preferences in College Admissions'' (New York: The Century Foundation Press, 2010), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools vary in how broadly they extend legacy preferences, with some schools granting this favor only to children of undergraduate alumni, while other schools extend the favor to children, grandchildren, siblings, nephews, and nieces of alumni of undergraduate and graduate programs.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Golden, "An Analytic Survey of Legacy Preferences," ''Affirmative-Action for the Rich'', edited by Richard D. Kahlenberg, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Preferential treatment based on legacy routinely grants legacies substantial bonus points on their admissions assessments and extra consideration if their applications are initially rejected. As a body of entering freshmen, legacies almost invariably have substantially lower [[GPA]]s and [[SAT]] scores than the larger body of entering freshmen, and, during their undergraduate careers, legacies as a body of students typically perform worse than the overall student body. A 2005 analysis of 180,000 student records obtained from nineteen selective colleges and universities found that, within a set range of SAT scores, being a legacy raised an applicant's chances of admission by 19.7 percentage points.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, "An Analytic Survey of Legacy Preference," ''Affirmative Action for the Rich'', p. 74-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While the sons of wealthy Americans had received priority in college admissions throughout the nineteenth century, in the early twentieth century, frustrated by the poor academic performances of their students, elite colleges raised their admission standards. Immigrants—especially the children of Jewish immigrant families—and Catholics and people from modest socioeconomic backgrounds frequently performed well on the new admissions tests and started to garner large numbers of undergraduate seats at top universities, while the number of admissions for wealthy white Anglo-American stock dropped significantly. In response, several Ivy League institutions began an official practice of legacy admissions, designed to reserve large numbers of seats at the top schools for the sons of wealthy Protestant American stock. These legacy admissions included decreasing the importance of entrance exams and adding such elements as assessing the "personal characteristics" of the young men seeking admittance, considering their "home influence," interviewing some of the applicants, and asking for letters of recommendation attesting to their character. Such elements in the application process curtailed the admittance of immigrants, Jews, Catholics, and working-class men and restored the overwhelming presence of the white, wealthy Anglo-Protestant men.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schmidt, "A History of Legacy Preferences and Privilege," ''Affirmative Action for the Rich: Legacy Preferences in College Admissions,'' edited by Richard D. Kahlenberg (New York: The Century Press, 2010), 38-44. See also Peter G. Schmidt, "Color and Money: How Rich White Kids Are Winning the War over College Affirmative Action" (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 survey found that of the top seventy-five universities in the ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' rankings, only one (the [[California Institute of Technology]]) had no legacy preferences at all; however, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] also indicates that it does not consider an applicant's legacy status. Legacy preferences were also ubiquitous among the one hundred top-ranked liberal arts colleges. The only liberal arts college in the top one hundred that explicitly said it did not use legacy preferences was [[Berea College|Berea]]. In recent decades,{{when|date=September 2018}} the use of legacy preferences has expanded well beyond undergraduate studies and now include admissions to graduate schools and professional fields of study, including law schools.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, "A History of Legacy Preferences and Privilege," 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current practices==
Currently, the [[Ivy League]] institutions are estimated to admit 10% to 30% of each entering class using legacy admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2333345 | work=The Economist | title=The curse of nepotism | date=January 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/5/11/admissions-fitzsimmons-legacy-legacies/ "Legacy Admit Rate at 30 Percent"], ''The Harvard Crimson''. May 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 2008 entering undergraduate class, the University of Pennsylvania admitted 41.7% of legacies who applied during the early decision admissions round and 33.9% of legacies who applied during the regular admissions cycle, versus 29.3% of all students who applied during the early decision admissions round and 16.4% of all who applied during the regular cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, "A History of Legacy Preferences and Privilege," 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Princeton admitted 41.7% of legacy applicants—more than 4.5 times the 9.2% rate of non-legacies. Similarly, in 2006, Brown University admitted 33.5% of alumni children, significantly higher than the 13.8% overall admissions rate. In 2003, Harvard admitted 40% of legacy applicants, compared to the overall 11% acceptance rate. In short, Ivy League and other top schools typically admit legacies at two to five times their overall admission rates.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, "An Analytic Survey of Legacy Preference," 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other top universities, the [[University of Notre Dame]] is known to weigh legacy status heavily in its application process.

Legacy preference is not strictly limited to college admissions, however; it may also come about with regard to admission into [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|collegiate fraternities and sororities]] and other [[fraternal organization]]s such as [[Freemasonry]]. Legacy preferences are generally not allowed in Europe.

The advantages that colleges offer legacy students extend well beyond admission preferences. Many colleges have various mechanisms for coaching legacies through the admissions process and for advising them about strategies for constructing successful applications, including notifying legacies of the edge that they can gain by applying early. Some universities have alumni councils that provide legacies with special advising sessions, pair these would-be students with current legacy students, and generally provide advice and mentoring for legacy applicants. Some universities employ admissions counselors dedicated solely to legacy applicants, and it is common to provide scholarships or tuition discounts earmarked especially for legacies and for legacies to be charged in-state tuition fees when they are out-of-state residents.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, "A History of Legacy Preferences and Privilege," 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where legacies are rejected, some universities offer legacy admissions counseling and help with placement at other colleges. Such students are often encouraged to enroll at a lesser ranked school for one or two years to prove themselves and then to reapply as transfer students. Because rankings by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' and other media take into account only the SAT scores and high school grades of entering freshmen, a college can accept poor achieving legacies as transfer students without hurting its standing. Harvard caters to the children of well-connected alumni and big donors through the "Z-list". Z-listers are often guaranteed admittance while in high school but obliged to take a year off between high school and attending Harvard, doing whatever they wish in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, "An Analytic Survey of Legacy Preference," 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Harvard University]] president [[Lawrence Summers]] has stated, "Legacy admissions are integral to the kind of community that any private educational institution is."  In the 1998 book ''The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions'', authors [[William G. Bowen]], former [[Princeton University]] president, and [[Derek Bok]], former Harvard University president, found "the overall admission rate for legacies was almost twice that for all other candidates." While the preference is quite common in elite universities and liberal arts colleges, it is quite controversial, with 75% of Americans opposing the preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/opinion/30kahlenberg.html|title=Elite Colleges, or Colleges for the Elite?|first=Richard D. |last=Kahlenberg |date=September 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In comparison to other programmes==
At some schools, legacy preferences have an effect on admissions comparable to other factors such as being a [[Athletic scholarship|recruited athlete]] or [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]]. One study of three selective private [[Research universities#Classification|research universities]] in the United States showed the following effects (admissions disadvantage and advantage in terms of [[SAT]] points on the new 1600-point scale):
* Blacks: +230
* Hispanics: +185
* Asians: -50
* Recruited athletes: +200
* Legacies (children of alumni): +160&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Espenshade | first1 = Thomas J. | last2 = Chung | first2 = Chang Y. | last3 = Walling | first3 = Joan L. | title = Admission preferences for minority students, athletes, and legacies at elite universities | journal = [[Social Science Quarterly]] | volume = 85 | issue = 5 | pages = 1422–1446 | publisher =  [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.0038-4941.2004.00284.x | date = December 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0038-4941.2004.00284.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.princeton.edu/~tje/files/Admission%20Preferences%20Espenshade%20Chung%20Walling%20Dec%202004.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it may initially appear that students of color are the most favored of all the groups in terms of college admissions, in practice, the widespread favoring of legacies has greatly reduced acceptance rates for black, Latino, and Asian-American applicants because the overwhelming majority of legacy students are white. According to a 2008 study, Duke's legacies are more likely to be white, Protestant, American citizens, and private high-school graduates than the overall student body. They are also significantly richer, with a familial income of $250,000 per year. In 2000-2001, of 567 alumni children attending Princeton, 10 were Latino and 4 were black. Similarly, a 2005 study reported that half the legacy applicants to selective colleges boasted family incomes in the top quartile of American earnings, compared to 29% of non-legacy students.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, "An Analytic Survey of Legacy Preferences," 77.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Texas A &amp; M--which no longer practices legacy admissions—enrolled 312 white students and only 27 Latino and 6 black students who would not have been admitted if not for their family ties.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, "A History of Legacy Preferences and Privilege," 67.&lt;/ref&gt; When a large number of legacies are admitted to post-secondary institutions, the volume of admissions who are people of color or who are from working classes plummets. Since 1983, there have been formal complaints to The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) that Asian-American applicants are being rejected in favor of students with lesser credentials.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, "A History of Legacy Preferences and Privilege," 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) determined that Harvard had admitted legacies at twice the rate of other applicants, that in several cases legacy status "'was the critical or decisive favor'" in a decision to admit an applicant, and that legacy preferences helped explained why 17.4% of white applicants were admitted but only 13.2% of Asian-American applicants during the previous decade. The OCR also found that legacies on average were rated lower than applicants who were neither legacies nor athletics in every important category (excluding athletic ability) in which applicants were judged.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, "A History of Legacy Preferences and Privilege, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy students as an overall pool of applicants routinely have poorer grades and lower SAT scores than the general pool of applicants for undergraduate admissions (athletes excepted).

In the 1990s, the University of California's Board of Regents voted to ban the use of affirmative action preferences throughout the system, and legacy privilege was abandoned across the University of California system soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, "A History of Legacy Preferences and Privilege," 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court upheld race-conscious admissions policies in its 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger decision, involving the University of Michigan's law school. With the judges having deep ties to their own elite post-secondary institutions, and with several being either former legacy students or the parents of legacies, the Court majority was not eager to ask the broader question regarding whether colleges were using race-conscious admissions policies to improve a problem of their own making, one arising from their legacy preferences and other admission practices that over-advantaged white students from economically privileged backgrounds. The only significant criticism of legacy preferences from the Court came from [[Clarence Thomas|Justice Clarence Thomas]], the sole member of the Supreme Court who grew up poor.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, "A History of Legacy Preferences and Privilege," 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the majority of Americans have been shown to strongly oppose legacy admissions, its beneficiaries hold key positions in Congress and the judiciary, protecting this practice from political and legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Golden, 'An Analytic Survey of Legacy Preference," ''Affirmative Action for the Rich'', 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on alumni donations==
Economically, while many schools say that a main reason for legacy preference is to increase donations,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Why Yale Favors Its Own|url=http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2004_11/q_a.html|date=November–December 2004|author=Kathrin Lassila|work=Yale Alumni magazine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202071219/http://yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2004_11/q_a.html|archivedate=2010-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at an aggregate (school-wide) level the decision to prefer legacies has not been shown to increase donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Chad Coffman |author2=Tara O'Neil |author3=Brian Starr |chapterurl=http://tcf.org/assets/downloads/2010-09-15-chapter_5.pdf|title=Affirmative Action for the Rich|chapter=Chapter 5: An Empirical Analysis of the Impact of Legacy Preferences on Alumni Giving at Top Universities|year=2010|ISBN=978-0-87078-518-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some instances, while alumni donations may go up if a child is intending on applying, donations fall if that child is rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meer |first=Jonathan |first2=Harvey S. |last2=Rosen |year=2009 |title=Altruism and the Child Cycle of Alumni Donations |journal=American Economic Journal: Economic Policy |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=258–86 |doi=10.1257/pol.1.1.258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Because private universities in the U.S. rely heavily on donations from alumni, critics argue that legacy preferences are a way to indirectly sell university placement. Opponents accuse these programs of perpetuating an [[oligarchy]] and [[plutocracy]] as they lower the weight of academic merit in the admissions process in exchange for a financial one. Legacy students tend to be the white wealthy, contributing to socioeconomic injustices. Another criticism is that the wealthy are given an insurmountable advantage which hinders economic mobility within the society, in effect creating a ''de facto'' [[caste system]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 2008, alumni donations accounted for 27.5% of all donations to higher education in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, "A History of Legacy Preferences and Privlege," 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, in an era of steeply declining governmental funding to post-secondary education, universities and colleges feel forced to rely heavily on private donations from alumni for donations to fund university operations budgets and infrastructure. Hence, one way to curb legacy admissions preferences would be for federal and state governments to better fund post-secondary education. In fact, several institutions have demonstrated that they can do extremely well without legacy admissions, including UC Berkeley, MIT and Caltech.

Some supporters of the elimination of all non-academic preferences point out that many European universities, including highly selective institutions such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], do not use legacy, racial, or athletic preferences in admissions decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oxford hopefuls urged to ditch the flute and work hard|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11108389|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 July 2011|date=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://baltimorepostexaminer.com/university-oxford-better-admissions-policies-elite-u-s-universities/2015/01/16|title=Does the University of Oxford have better admissions policies than elite U.S. universities?|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also legal arguments against legacy preferences.  In public schools, legacy preferences may violate the [[Nobility Clause]] and the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] by creating a hereditary privilege and discriminating on the basis of ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Carlton.  [http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol84/iss6/2/ “Titles of Nobility, Hereditary Privilege, and the Unconstitutionality of Legacy Preferences in Public School Admissions”], ''Washington University Law Review'',  Volume 84, page 1375 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Legacy preferences in both public and private universities may be illegal under the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (now codified in Section 1981 of the U.S. Code).

==Reception==
The first volume was reviewed by an overall positive review by Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network. With an overall grade of B-, Ms. Silverman stating “The dark magical girl story may not be new, but Magical Girl Special Ops Asuka shows that it's still a genre with potential. Alternately relying on and eschewing genre tropes, Asuka's struggle with her violent past and magical girl identity stands to be both exciting and psychologically interesting.” She was most critical concerning the relaying on tropes without fulling committing to the unique characteristics of the storyline and the inconsistency in the artwork. This inconsistency was mostly with the characteristics of main heroine which contributes to overtly sexualizing the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/magical-girl-special-ops-asuka/gn-1/.125076 |title=Magical Girl SPEC-OPS Asuka GN 1 |last=Silverman |first=Rebecca |date=December 12, 2017 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=January 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Böttger studied physics at the [[TU Dresden]] and was a [[Construction soldier]] until 1972. Since 1972 he was active in church-based peace activism. He worked as a computer programmer at [[Robotron]] [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]] until 1976 and at Versorgungskontor Leder until 1979. He worked as a research associate at the [[Deutsche Bauakademie]] until 1983. In 1982 he gained a doctorate in technical mechanics at the TU Dresden under [[Günther Landgraf]].

In 1976 and 1980 he was briefly arrested by the [[Stasi]] for participating in first of May demonstrations using a self-made sign. In September 1983 he was arrested for a longer period for "attempted participation in a [[human chain]] during the [[International Day of Peace]]". From the year 1985 on, Böttger worked as a computer programmer at the state-owned gasoline retailer [[Minol]]. In 1985 he co-founded the [[Initiative for Peace and Human Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jugendopposition.de/index.php?id=2367 Martin Böttger mit weiteren Mitgliedern der IFM 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; led this group's task force „Human rights and the judiciary" and contributed to the publication and dissemination of underground [[Samizdat]] magazines.

In 1989 he was a founding member of [[New Forum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jugendopposition.de/index.php?id=1723 Martin Böttger bei der Gründung des Neuen Forum in Grünheide]&lt;/ref&gt; and the coordinator of this civil rights movement in the district of [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]]. In March 1990 he was elected into the [[Volkskammer]] with [[Bündnis 90]], but immediately handed the mandate to [[Werner Schulz]]. Until 1994 he was a delegate to the Landtag of the Free State of [[Saxony]]. From 1994 he was the managing director of a group of homes for the elderly in [[Kirchberg, Saxony]]. From 2001 until 2010 he was the director of the [[Chemnitz]] branch of the [[Stasi Records Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Leipziger Volkszeitung (LVZ-online) vom 23.

== Bürokratopoly ==
Bürokratopoly is an educational tabletop game. Its author Martin Böttger used to satirize the East German state in the early 1980s. The game spread in the political underground. Over 30 years after its development it was remade and optimized as a teaching aid for use in history class. Bürokratopoly captures an authentic perspective on East Germany in game form and provokes discussions of democracy, politics and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bürokratopoly - Ein Lehrspiel aus der DDR|trans-title=|periodical=www.buerokratopoly.de|publisher=|url=http://www.buerokratopoly.de/|format=|accessdate=2016-01-16|last=DDR-Museum|date=2014|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monotenure''' is a [[planning]] term relating to the [[land tenure]] of a development or neighbourhood. There are generally three types of residential land tenure within the built environment: [[private rented sector|private sector housing]] (also known as market housing), [[public housing|social housing]], and intermediate (or [[shared ownership]]) housing. The term monotenure can be applied to an area where any of these three types of tenures are prevalent; however, the term is generally used to apply to areas where [[public housing|social housing]] is the primary tenure.

'Monotenure' areas generally relate to the most [[poverty]] stricken areas within an urban area, suffering from higher levels of crime, [[fear of crime]], economic deprivation, and [[social exclusion]].

In recent years, governments in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] have targeted social tenure neighbourhoods for 'regeneration', with a primary aim of converting some or all of the social housing into private sector housing. 

In the UK, the majority of monotenure neighbourhoods were formed post [[World War II]], when the Government undertook a programme of [[slum clearance]]. Since the 1970s, the UK government has restricted funding for [[public housing|social housing]] projects. This has also impacted upon the existing housing stock, which has often fallen into disrepair. Many Councils are now seeking to address the problems of monotenure neighbourhoods through estate renewal. [[Private rented sector|Private sector housing]] is used to not only fund the development but also to address the monotenure nature of the neighbourhood and create a more 'mixed' community. This dilution of public sector housing is considered to lead to more sustainable and successful communities. In addition, the provision and sale of private sector housing can be used to fund improvements to the existing public sector housing.  Monies for the improvement of [[public housing|social housing]] have dried up in recent years and it is anticipated that future improvements to [[public housing|social housing]] will only be achieved through the provision of [[private rented sector|private sector housing]].

'''Moral equivalence''' is a term used in political debate, usually to deny that a moral comparison can be made of two sides in a conflict, or in the actions or tactics of two sides.

The term had some currency in polemic debates about the [[Cold War]], and currently the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. "Moral equivalence" began to be used as a polemic ''term-of-retort'' to "[[moral relativism]]", which had been gaining use as an indictment against political foreign policy that appeared to use only a [[situational ethics|situation]]-based application of widely held [[Ethics|ethical]] standards.

International conflicts are sometimes viewed similarly, and interested parties periodically urge both sides to conduct a ceasefire and negotiate their differences. However these negotiations may prove difficult in that both parties in a conflict believe that they are [[superiority complex|morally superior]] to the other, and are unwilling to negotiate on basis of moral equivalence.

==Cold War==
In the [[Cold War]] context, the term was and is most commonly used by anti-Communists as an accusation of [[formal fallacy]] for [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] criticisms of United States foreign policy and military conduct.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Many such people believed in the idea that the [[United States]] was intrinsically benevolent, that the extension of its power, influence and hegemony was an extension of benevolence and would bring freedom to those people subject to that hegemony. Therefore, those who opposed the United States were by definition evil, trying to deny its benevolence to people. The USSR and its allies, in contrast, practiced a [[totalitarian]] ideology. A territory under US hegemony thus would be freed from possibly being in the camp of the totalitarian power and would help to weaken it. Thus, all means were justified in keeping territories away from Soviet influence in this way. This extended to countries not under Soviet influence but instead said to be sympathetic at all in any way with it. Therefore, [[Chile]] under [[Salvador Allende]] was not under Soviet domination, but removing him would help weaken the USSR by removing a government ruled with the help of a [[Communist Party]]. The big picture, they would say, justified the tortures carried out by the [[Augusto Pinochet]] dictatorship as it served to weaken the totalitarian Communist camp and in time bring about the freedom of those under its domination.

Some of those who criticized US foreign policy at the time contended that US power in the [[Cold War]] was used only to pursue an [[Capitalism|economically-driven agenda]]. They claim that the underlying economic motivation eroded any claims of [[Moral hierarchy|moral superiority]], leaving the hostile acts in ([[Korean War|Korea]], [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungary]], [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghanistan]], [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]]) to stand on their own. In contrast, those who justified US interventions in the Cold War period always cast these as being motivated by the need to contain totalitarianism and thus fulfilled a higher moral imperative.

An early popularizer of the expression was [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], who was United States ambassador to the [[United Nations]] in the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration. Kirkpatrick published an article called "The Myth of Moral Equivalence" in 1986, in which sharply criticized those who she alleged were claiming that there was "no moral difference" between the [[Soviet Union]] and democratic states.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeane Kirkpatrick]]. ''[http://www.hillsdale.edu/news/imprimis/archive/issue.asp?year=1986&amp;month=01 The Myth of Moral Equivalence]'',   January 1986, Vol. 15, No. 1, ''[[Imprimis]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, very few critics of United States policies in the Cold War era argued that there was a moral equivalence between the two sides. [[Communists]], for instance, argued that the Soviet Union was morally superior to its adversaries. Kirkpatrick herself was one of the most outspoken voices calling for the US to support authoritarian military regimes in Central America that were responsible for major human rights violations. When four US churchwomen were raped and murdered by government soldiers in El Salvador, Kirkpatrick downplayed the gravity of the crime, remarking that 'the nuns were not just nuns, they were political activists'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/bringing-el-salvador-nun-killers-to-justice&lt;/ref&gt; According to Congressman Robert Torricelli, Reagan administration officials, including Kirkpatrick, deliberately suppressed information about government abuses in El Salvador: "While the Reagan Administration was certifying human rights progress in El Salvador they knew the terrible truth that the Salvadoran military was engaged in a widespread campaign of terror and torture."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/world/how-us-actions-helped-hide-salvador-human-rights-abuses.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

Leftist critics usually argued that the United States itself created a "moral equivalence" when some of its actions, such as President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s support for the ''[[Contras|Contra]]'' insurgency against the [[Sandinista]] government in [[Nicaragua]], put it on the same level of [[immorality]] as the Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Moral equivalence has featured in debates over [[NATO expansion]], the overthrow of [[rogue states]], the [[invasion of Iraq]], and the [[War on Terror]]. Concepts of moral hierarchy have been applied to foreign policy challenges such as [[Islamic fundamentalists]], [[anti-Israel]] powers, [[Russia]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[drug traffickers]], and [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[nationalists]], among others.

After the [[Partition of India|partition]] of [[India]] in [[1947 in Pakistan|1947]], [[Captain (Army)|Captain]] Sharif moved to join the newly formed [[Pakistan Army]] where his career progressed extremely well, having attended and graduated from the [[Imperial Defence College]].{{rp|302}}&lt;ref name="The Gazette of Pakistan, 1979" /&gt; In 1952, [[Major]] Sharif was promoted as a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] and qualified as [[psc (military)|psc]] from the [[Command and Staff College]] in [[Quetta]]; later achieved promotion to the [[one-star rank]] in the army in 1959.&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1999"/&gt;

In 1960, [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brig.]] Shariff played a crucial role when he commanded the tactical [[Brigade combat team|strike brigade]] to remove the [[Dir (princely state)|Nawab of Dir]] and [[Jandol State|Khan of Jandol]] to prevent succession from [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 2002"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amin|first1=A.H.|title=Remembering Our Warriors: Brig.

In 1964–66, [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brig.]] Sharif moved to the staff assignment at the [[GHQ (Pakistan Army)|Army GHQ]], serving in the [[Pakistan Army Education Corps|Corps of Education]] where he served on the army board to select the potential candidates to be educated at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1999"/&gt; In 1966, [[Major-General]] Sharif was appointed as the [[List of serving Generals of the Pakistan Army|Inspector General Training and Evaluation]] (IGT&amp;E) at the [[GHQ (Pakistan Army)|Army GHQ]], and later appointed as the [[Commandant]] of the [[Command and Staff College]] in [[Quetta]], which he served until 1970.{{rp|374}}&lt;ref name="Ilmi Kitab Khana, 1979" /&gt;

In 1970, [[Major-General|Maj-Gen.]] Sharif was promoted to the [[Three-star rank|three-star]] rank in the army, and took over the diplomatic assignment as opposed to the command assignment.{{rp|374}}&lt;ref name="Ilmi Kitab Khana, 1979" /&gt; [[Lieutenant-General]] Shariff was posted as the [[Pakistani diplomatic missions|permanent representative]] at the [[Central Treaty Organization|CENTO]]'s [[Headquarters|HQ]] in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]], which he remained until 1971.&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1999" /&gt;

On 12 December 1971, [[Lieutenant-General|Lt-Gen.]] Sharif returned to Pakistan and partially took over the command of the [[Structure of the Pakistan Army|33rd Infantry Division]], stationed in [[Quetta]], from its [[General officer commanding|GOC]], [[Major-General|Maj-Gen.]] Naseer Ahmad, who was [[wounded in action]] against the [[Indian Army]].&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1999" /&gt; After inspecting the [[Division (military)|infantry division]], Lt-Gen.

In 1972, Lt-Gen. Shariff was appointed as [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief|field commander]] of the [[II Corps (Pakistan)|II Corps]], stationed in [[Multan]].{{rp|441}}&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press, 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nawaz|first1=Shuja|title=Crossed swords : Pakistan, its army, and the wars within|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Karachi|isbn=9780195476606|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Lt-Gen. Shariff played a crucial role in his role as a [[secondment]] when he led his [[II Corps (Pakistan)|II Corps]] to provide the [[military aid to the civil power]] to maintain [[Law and order in Pakistan|law and order]] in [[Karachi]], amid the [[Karachi labour unrest of 1972|labour unrest]].&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1999" /&gt; In 1974, Lt-Gen, Shariff was honorary appointed as a [[Colonel commandant]] of the [[Punjab Regiment (Pakistan)|Punjab Regiment]].&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1999" /&gt;

==Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee==

In 1976, General [[Tikka Khan]]'s retirement as a [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|chief of army staff]] was due, and Lt-Gen. Sharif was the most senior army general in the [[Pakistani military]].{{rp|262}}&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press, 1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolpert|first1=Stanley A.|title=Zulfi Bhutto of Pakistan: his life and times|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Karachi|isbn=9780195076615|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C-ltAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=lt+gen+muhammad+shariff&amp;dq=lt+gen+muhammad+shariff|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Lt-Gen, Sharif was in the race for the promotion of [[Four-star rank|four-star]] rank alongside six other army generals.{{rp|67}}&lt;ref name="Penguin Books 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baruah|first1=Amit|title=Dateline Islamabad|date=2007|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=9780143102465|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yu6LvrhQst4C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=lt+gen+muhammad+shariff#v=onepage&amp;q=lt%20gen%20muhammad%20shariff&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] promoted and elevated the junior-most Lt-Gen, [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], to the [[Four-star rank|four-star]] appointment and appointed him as nation's second [[Army Chief of Staff (Pakistan)|army chief]] in 1976.{{rp|67}}&lt;ref name="Penguin Books 2007"/&gt; [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Prime Minister Bhutto]] moved to create the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee]] and promoted Lt-Gen. Shariff to the four-star rank, posting him as first [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee]] on 1 March 1976.{{rp|contents}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alam|first1=Dr Shah|title=Pakistan Army: Modernisation, Arms Procurement and Capacity Building|date=2012|publisher=Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|isbn=9789381411797|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WvapCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT51&amp;dq=lt+gen+muhammad+shariff+chairman#v=onepage&amp;q=lt%20gen%20muhammad%20shariff%20chairman&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His relations with Gen. Zia remains officially business but seemed to have dislike General Zia personally.{{rp|125–126}}&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khan|first1=Feroz Hassan|title=Eating Grass: The Making of the Pakistan' atomic bomb|date=2012|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Palo Alto, ca, u.s.|isbn=9780804784801|pages=400|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yGgrNAsKZjEC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=muhammad+sharif+zia#v=onepage&amp;q=muhammad%20sharif%20zia&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=en-us|format=google books|chapter={{small|Punishing Pakistan}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974-75, Lt-Gen. Sharif had submitted a report to then-army chief General [[Tikka Khan]] that detailed the actions of [[Major-General|Maj-Gen.]] Zia's actions bypassing the [[Chain of Command|chain of command]] in the military but the report was overshadowed due Zia's dedication towards promoting the professionalism in the military.{{rp|125–126}}&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press, 2012"/&gt; His duties as [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] had been largely ineffective, and his deputy Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff|M.S.

His relations with Gen. Zia soured and was not supportive towards the actions by General Zia of [[Operation Fair Play|military takeover]] of the [[Government of Pakistan|civilian government]],{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} and regretted that this ultimate step had become inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arif |first1=Khalid Mahmud |year=1995 |title=Working with Zia : Pakistan's power politics, 1977-1988 |location=Karachi |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=98 |isbn=978-0-19-577570-9 |language=en |quote=[Upon being informed that Operation Fair Play was underway,] General Shariff felt sorry that this ultimate step had become inevitable.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1977, General Sharif prematurely seek retirement and he submitted his resignation to the [[President of Pakistan]], asking him to relieve him of his duty.{{rp|304}}&lt;ref name="The Gazette of Pakistan, 1979" /&gt;

In public circles, General Shariff privately made it clear that the [[1977 Pakistani coup d'état|martial law]] was in fact unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1999" /&gt;  Furthermore, the General Shariff was of the view of strengthening the Chairman joint chiefs' role more assertive and power than the army chief but before the system could evolve itself into a cohesive working structure the July 1977 coup disturbed the power balance totally, and tilted it heavily in favor of the army chief.&lt;ref&gt;Brig (retd) Yasub Ali Dogar. [http://www.defencejournal.com/jan99/defence.htm "Pakistan's Higher Defence Reorganisation"] ''Defence Journal'' January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, General Shariff left the chairmanship of the joint chiefs to his deputy Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]] but it was not until 1979 when his resignation actually went effective.{{rp|304}}&lt;ref name="The Gazette of Pakistan, 1979" /&gt; After his retirement he faded from public life, refusing to accept any post in government, living off his pension and savings.&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1999" /&gt; He died in Lahore on 6 August 1999.&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1999" /&gt;

The '''Novi Sad raid''', also known as the '''Raid in southern Bačka''', the '''Novi Sad massacre''', the '''Újvidék massacre''', or simply '''The Raid''' (''Рација'' / ''Racija''), was a military operation carried out by the [[Hungarian Defence Force|Honvédség]], the armed forces of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], during [[World War II]]. It resulted in the deaths of 3,000–4,000 civilians in the southern [[Bačka]] region of [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|Hungarian-occupied]] [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

The Hungarian occupational authorities began raiding towns and villages in southern Bačka as early as 6 January 1942, ostensibly as a means of suppressing [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] resistance, though the historical record shows that the [[Government of Hungary|Hungarian Government]] was attempting to improve its geopolitical standing vis-à-vis [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The first town to be raided was [[Čurug]], followed by [[Gospođinci]], [[Titel]], [[Temerin]], [[Đurđevo]] and [[Žabalj]]. The victims were seemingly detained at random while conducting everyday activities. On 20 January, the city of [[Novi Sad]] ({{lang-hu|Újvidék}}) was surrounded and placed on curfew; its telephone lines were cut. Over the next several days, the occupational authorities went about arresting "suspicious" individuals. More than 1,000 of the city's residents were killed by the time the raid ended. The victims in both Novi Sad and the wider region were mostly [[Serbs]] and [[Jews]], though several Hungarians were killed as well. In Novi Sad, victims were forced to march across the frozen [[Danube]], only to perish when the ice sheet was shattered by shelling from the shore. Some were pushed into holes in the ice sheet, causing them to drown or succumb to [[hypothermia]], while others were shot in the street. 

The Hungarian Government and news media condemned the raid, calling for an immediate investigation. In 1943, the Hungarians conducted a mass trial of those suspected of organizing the raid, handing down four [[capital punishment|death sentences]]. The four escaped to Germany before their executions. After the war, several trials were held in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], resulting in the conviction and execution of a number of key organizers. The final court proceedings relating to the raid took place in 2011, when [[Sándor Képíró]] was tried and acquitted of murdering over 30 civilians in Novi Sad.

The raid has been fictionalized in literature and film in both [[Serbia]] and [[Hungary]]. The killings continue to strain [[Hungary–Serbia relations|relations]] between the two countries. In June 2013, Hungarian [[President of Hungary|President]] President [[János Áder]] formally apologized for the [[war crimes]] that the Hungarian military had committed against Serbian civilians during the war.

==Background==
[[File:Hungarian Occupied Yugoslavia 1941 44.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Hungarian-occupied areas of Yugoslavia; [[Bačka]] is shown in green.|alt=map of the occupied territories and their subdivisions under Hungarian rule.]]
[[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]] invaded [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] on 6 April 1941, in response to a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]] that deposed the country's [[regent]], [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Paul]], and hastened the ascent of his underage nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]] to the throne.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}} The country was overrun in less than two weeks, occupied and partitioned among its neighbours.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=49}} The area that constitutes the present-day province of [[Vojvodina]], in northern Serbia, was divided between Germany, Hungary and the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna Država Hrvatska}}; NDH), which was established shortly after the invasion.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=63–64}} The Germans assumed direct control of the [[Banat]], which became an autonomous district of the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied territory of Serbia]], primarily to satisfy the demands of the region's sizeable [[Germans of Yugoslavia|ethnic German]] (''[[Volksdeutsche]]'') population.{{sfn|Lemkin|2008|pp=251–252}} The Croatians occupied [[Syrmia]] and incorporated it into the NDH, stopping just short of [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} The Hungarians [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|occupied]] [[Bačka]], which had been a part of Hungary until the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920, when it was incorporated into the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). A large number of Hungarians and ethnic Germans had remained in the areas despite the cession.{{sfn|Lemkin|2008|pp=261–262}} Hungarian-occupied Bačka consisted of that part of the former [[Danube Banovina]] once bounded by the Hungarian–Yugoslav border to the north, the [[Danube]] to the south and west, and the [[Tisza]] to the west.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=62}} The total area of Hungarian-occupied Bačka was {{convert|8558|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Ungváry|2011|p=70}}

The Hungarian occupational authorities resolved to "rebalance" the ethnic makeup of Bačka while the invasion was still underway. Within days of the invasion, [[Serbs|Serb]] and [[Jews|Jewish]] homes were attacked and looted. On 14 April 1941, as many as 500 Serbs and Jews were killed, likely in accordance with previously assembled lists of people marked for death. Legislation was soon passed requiring that all non-Hungarians and non-Germans who had moved to the area after 1918 be deported.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=87}}{{efn|Between 1918 and 1924, nearly 45,000 Hungarians had been deported to Hungary from the territories transferred to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and more than 10,000 South Slavic military settlers ({{lang-sh|Solunski dobrovoljci}}, lit. [[Salonika front|Salonika]] volunteers), mainly Serbs, were settled in the region.{{sfn|Ungváry|2011|p=75}}}} The Hungarian occupational authorities expelled between 25,000 and 60,000 Serbs from Bačka, both colonists from the [[interwar period]], as well as pre-[[World War I]] inhabitants.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=170}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=84}} They were first interned in [[concentration camp]]s before being deported to the German-occupied territory of Serbia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=171}} The Hungarians originally intended to expel as many as 150,000, but this plan was opposed by the German command in Belgrade, and subsequently fell through.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=170}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=84}} More than 15,000 Hungarian colonists later settled the area, moving into the homes of the Serbs that were forced out.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=138}} 

A policy of "systematic [[magyarization]]" was implemented within the occupied territories.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=171}} "Less-desirable elements" of the population, such as Serbs, Croats and Jews, were discriminated against in matters of communication and education. [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[German language|German]] were the only languages permitted in almost all secondary schools, and [[Serbo-Croatian]] books, newspapers and periodicals were virtually banned.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=170–171}} Despite this, most Serbs and Croats that had lived in the Hungarian-occupied territories prior to 1918 retained their citizenship rights as Hungarians, and some lower-level non-Hungarian public employees retained their jobs.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=84}} On 14 December 1941, Bačka, along with the other Hungarian-occupied areas of Yugoslavia, referred to by Hungary as the "Recovered Southern Territories" ({{lang-hu|Délvidék|links=no}}),{{sfn|Lemkin|2008|p=631}}{{sfn|Levene|2013|p=179}} were officially annexed and formally incorporated into Hungary.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=170}}

==Prelude==
===Initial resistance===
Small-scale armed resistance broke out in Bačka in the second half of 1941 and the Hungarian military reacted with heavy repressive measures.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=172–173}} More than 300 prisoners were executed in September 1941 alone.{{sfn|Ungváry|2011|p=73}} Thousands of Serbs and Jews were detained in concentration camps that had been established in [[Ada, Serbia|Ada]], [[Bačka Topola]], [[Begeč]], [[Odžaci]], [[Bečej]], [[Subotica]] and [[Novi Sad]], as well as at [[Pécs]] and [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]], in Hungary-proper.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=87}} The [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|communist]]-led [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] resistance movement of [[Josip Broz Tito]] was never strong in Bačka because the region's flat terrain did not lend itself to [[guerilla warfare]], and because [[South Slavs]], from which the Partisans drew most of their recruits, only made up one-third of the regional population.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=172–173}} By the end of 1941, the Partisans of Bačka had largely been destroyed, as had their regional committee.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=107}} The [[Chetniks]], [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] irregulars seeking to reinstate the Yugoslav monarchy, offered sporadic resistance during the invasion, but were largely inactive for much of the occupation, maintaining some covert activity only.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=172–173}}

Before the war, Bačka was home to around 15,000 Jews.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=114}} This constituted more than one-fifth of Yugoslavia's pre-war Jewish population. Moreover, more than 90 percent of the Jews living in the Hungarian-occupied territories of Yugoslavia hailed from the region.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=583}} The Hungarian government had passed [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] laws in 1939, and following the outbreak of the war, these were applied in the occupied and annexed territories.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=87}} After the violence of the initial occupation, no further massacres of Jews occurred in Bačka for the remainder of 1941,{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=87}} though the Jewish community was subjected to a string of discriminatory measures, such as the confiscation of property, arbitrary detention and forced labour.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=114}}

===Escalation===
By early 1942, the Hungarian military estimated that there were no more than 110 Partisans operating in all of Vojvodina, though in reality, the true figure was closer to 40.{{sfn|Ungváry|2011|pp=77–78}} On 4 January 1942, several dozen Partisans from the Šajkaška Partisan detachment were found hiding at a farm near [[Žabalj]]. They were engaged by the Hungary military, and in the ensuing clash, 10 Hungarian soldiers and seven Partisans were killed.{{sfn|Sajti|2003|pp=347–349}} The remaining Partisans were arrested and deported to German-occupied Serbia. The [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Hungary|Hungarian General Staff]] seized on the incident, using it as a pretext for launching attacks throughout the region that were intended to deter non-Hungarians from joining the resistance.{{sfn|Ungváry|2011|pp=77–78}}

On 5 January, [[Ferenc Szombathelyi]], the Chief of the Hungarian General Staff, ordered punitive raids against the Partisans of Bačka. The order coincided with German [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Foreign Minister]] [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]'s visit to Budapest on 6 January. Several days later, ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' ([[Field Marshall]]) [[Wilhelm Keitel]], the chief of the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Supreme Command of the Armed Forces]], arrived in Budapest requesting that the entire [[Royal Hungarian Army]] be moved to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Hungarian [[Prime Minister of Hungary|Prime Minister]] [[László Bárdossy]] declined, and in order to justify this decision, sought to demonstrate that Hungarian troops were desperately needed in the occupied territories. The Hungarian General Staff requested that the occupational authorities provide proof of an imminent, large-scale Partisan revolt in Bačka to show the Germans.{{sfn|Ungváry|2011|pp=77–78}} Hungary's leaders may also have been motivated to pursue a harsh response to demonstrate that they were strong enough to deal with Serb resistance and Jewish "subversion", and thus convince Germany that Hungary was competent enough to control the Banat, which had been part of the country before World War I.{{sfn|Patai|1996|p=550}} According to the Holocaust scholar Mark Levene, the raid "may well have been intended as a dread signal from Budapest that Hungarian rule over non-Hungarians in the Balkans&amp;nbsp;... would be every bit as brutal as that of&amp;nbsp;... other occupying powers, or, for that matter, as it had previously been in Hungarian-occupied Serbia during the Great War."{{sfn|Levene|2013|p=179}} Accordingly, further guerrilla attacks were orchestrated by the occupational authorities in order to magnify the size of the Partisan resistance. Bandages were distributed to gendarmes, and they were instructed to wear them on their heads and hands to simulate the effects of being wounded. These events were staged primarily for public consumption.{{sfn|Yahil|1991|p=503}}

==Timeline==
===Killings commence===
More than 8,000 soldiers, gendarmes and border guards participated in the raid.{{sfn|Ungváry|2011|pp=77–78}} It began in the town of [[Čurug]] on 6 January, with suspected Partisans, including women and children, being removed to barns, storage buildings, and municipal buildings. Although some suspects were released, between 500 and 1,000 people were killed and their bodies stripped of all valuables. The raid moved onto other local settlements such as [[Gospođinci]] and [[Titel]] the same day and continued the day after. Over the next three days, additional killings took place in the towns of [[Temerin]] and [[Žabalj]].{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=88}} Civilians were rounded up at random and taken from their homes and businesses during their workday and while they were engaged in regular activities, even weddings.{{sfn|Golubović|1992|pp=43–44, 147, 194}}

===Novi Sad massacre===
On 20 January, Novi Sad was completely surrounded and placed on curfew. Its telephone and telegraph lines were cut.{{sfnm|1a1=Yahil|1y=1991|1p=503|2a1=Cornelius|2y=2011|2p=189|3a1=Ungváry|3y=2011|3pp=77–78}} The city was divided into multiple areas of responsibility, with a different officer tasked with organizing the round-ups in each.{{sfn|Zuroff|2009|p=209}} Placards sprang up on buildings, warning citizens against going outdoors, except to buy food. Feketehalmy-Czeydner summoned the local authorities and announced that the Royal Hungary Army would "take charge and clean things up" over the next three days. The raid began the following day. Between 6,000 and 7,000 people that were considered "suspicious" were arrested and taken to have their papers examined.{{sfn|Cornelius|2011|p=189}} Others were detained on account that they had no papers.{{sfn|Ungváry|2011|pp=77–78}} Most were released, but at least 40 were taken to the banks of the Danube and shot.{{sfn|Cornelius|2011|p=189}} 

"The massacre was conducted systematically," the historian [[Leni Yahil]] writes, "street by street."{{sfn|Yahil|1991|p=503}} Many of the soldiers were visibly intoxicated.{{sfn|Yahil|1991|p=503}}{{sfn|Cornelius|2011|p=189}} Survivor accounts, delivered after the war, attest to the brutality of the killings. A woman recalled how, on 23 April, a soldier entered her apartment, demanding to know her family's religious affiliation. The woman told him that she and her family were [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]]. Infuriated, the soldier called her a "stinking Serb" and killed her five sons.{{sfn|Klajn|2007|p=132}} Thousands of men, women and children were imprisoned and interrogated at the Sokolski Dom, one of the city's main cultural centres. Many died during their interrogation.{{sfn|Zuroff|2009|p=209}} 

Temperatures reached {{convert|-29|C|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Yahil|1991|p=503}} Victims were brought to an area known as the [[Štrand]], along the Danube, and shot with machine guns. Their killers then broke up the frozen river's ice sheets with artillery fire and tossed the bodies into the water. According to another account, the victims were forced to tread the ice sheets, which were then shattered by shelling from the shore, causing them to fall into the freezing water and drown.{{sfn|Cymet|2010|p=355}} The killings only ceased after four days, when the city's Lord Lieutenant, [[László Deák]], bypassed the curfew and alerted the authorities in Budapest.{{sfn|Yahil|1991|p=503}}{{sfn|Cornelius|2011|p=189}} He returned with orders that the massacre was to come to an immediate halt. Feketehalmy-Czeydner ordered that all executions be stopped by 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Deák's mother was among the victims.{{sfn|Cornelius|2011|p=189}} "The randomness and senselessness of the operation were evident especially by the fact that it hit not one single functionary of the Yugoslav Communist Party," the historian [[Krisztián Ungváry]] writes.{{sfn|Ungváry|2011|pp=77–78}}

==Aftermath==
In [[Stari Bečej]], the occupational authorities staged another "rebellion" and followed it up with further mass arrests. Around 200 people were detained and taken to the banks of the Tisza, where they were shot and their bodies thrown into the river. When the ice thawed, the corpses of those killed in the raid floated down the Danube and the Tisza.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|pp=88–89}} The Hungarian news media denounced the raid as unparalleled in the country's military history. The Hungarian government also condemned the killings, vowing that the perpetrators would be brought to justice.{{sfn|Patai|1996|p=550}}

===Casualties===
[[File:Racija1942 01.png|right|thumb|250px|Map of places affected by the raid]]
In a contemporary correspondence, Hungary's [[Ministry of Interior (Hungary)|Minister of the Interior]], [[Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer]], wrote that 3,755 people lost their lives in the raid.{{sfn|Patai|1996|p=550}} The historian [[Rudolph Rummel]] places the number of deaths resulting from the raid at 3,200.{{sfn|Rummel|1998|p=176}} The Holocaust scholar [[Leni Yahil]] writes that 4,116 individuals were killed – 2,842 Serbs, 1,250 Jews, 13 Russians and 11 Hungarians.{{sfn|Yahil|1991|p=503}} The historian Zvonimir Golubović places the total number of civilians killed in the raid at 3,809.{{sfn|Golubović|1992|pp=43–44, 147, 194}} This figure is accepted by the Holocaust scholar [[Yehuda Bauer]].{{sfn|Bauer|1996|p=149}} The following table, composed by Golubović, lists the victims according to their gender, ethnicity and the place that they were killed:{{sfn|Golubović|1992|pp=43–44, 147, 194}}

===Legal proceedings===
In 1943, Hungarian leader [[Miklós Horthy]] ordered an investigation into the massacres and charges were brought against some of those that had conducted them.{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=329}} Those charged fled to [[Nazi Germany]] and returned only after German forces [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|occupied Hungary in 1944]].{{sfn|Golubović|1992|p=187}} Horthy used the investigation as a method of distinguishing his regime from that of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Szinai, M. &amp; L.

Some Serbian historians, such as Golubović and Aleksandar Veljić, have claimed that Horthy himself was aware of the raids and approved them being carried out.{{sfn|Golubović|1992|pp=43–44, 147, 194}}&lt;ref&gt;Veljić, Aleksandar.

After questions were raised in the Hungarian parliament the prime minister [[László Bárdossy]] sent a commission of inquiry to investigate. That investigation supported the story that the army had been battling partisans. A further investigation by Bárdossy's successor [[Miklós Kállay]] came to similar conclusions.{{sfn|Yahil|1991|p=503}}

In 1943, Hungary organized a trial of several officers who were among those responsible for the raids leading to four death sentences.{{sfn|Yahil|1991|p=504}} Four of those charged escaped to Germany before their sentencing.{{sfn|Golubović|1992|p=187}} After the war, some of the individuals responsible for the raids were tried again by the new communist government of Hungary (which sentenced them to death or to life in prison) and again in Yugoslavia, where they were sentenced to death again, and executed. Horthy who was, according to Yugoslav/Serbian historians, among those responsible for the raids, was never indicted or tried.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In September 2006, [[Efraim Zuroff]] of the [[Wiesenthal Center]] made public copies of a 1944 court verdict finding [[Sándor Képíró]] and 14 other [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian Army]] and police officers of taking part in 1942 raid in Novi Sad. In 1948, the government of Hungary retried him ''in absentia'' and sentenced him to 14 years. This verdict was based upon the testimony of János Nagy, a former Hungarian soldier of Képíró's platoon. However, the testimony was given after [[State Protection Authority|the communist secret service]] tortured Nagy. Képíró, however, stated that as a police officer, his participation was limited merely to arresting civilians, and he did not take part in the executions or any other illegal activity.&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;Wood, Nicholas"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/world/europe/28iht-hungary.2970014.html Nazi hunters identify convicted war criminal]", ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 28 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; War crimes charges were subsequently brought against Képíró in a federal court in Budapest, for murders of civilians committed under his command during the January 1942 raids. His trial on those charges commenced in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20060408-504083.html "97-year-old Hungarian Sandor Kepiro on trial for Nazi war crimes"]&lt;/ref&gt; Képíró was acquitted on all counts in July 2011.

===Retribution and formal apologies===
Mass killings targeting Jews, such as those that occurred during the raid, were relatively uncommon in Hungary-proper and the occupied areas until October 1944, when the Germans [[Operation Margarethe|assumed direct control of the country and the regions it had occupied]], deporting hundreds of thousands of Jews to death camps.{{sfn|Bloxham|Moses|2011|p=109}}{{sfn|Byford|2013|pp=520–521}}

In June 2013, [[President of Hungary|Hungarian President]] [[János Áder]] apologised in [[Belgrade]] for the war crimes committed against civilian Serbs and Jewish people during the [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories]]. Some days earlier members of the Serbian Parliament adopted a declaration, which condemned the massacres and application of the principle of collective guilt against Hungarians in [[Vojvodina]] at the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20130627/hungarian-president-in-belgrade-visit-apologizes-for-crimes-against-innocent-serbs-in-world-war-ii|title=Hungarian president in Belgrade visit apologizes for crimes against innocent Serbs in World War II|publisher=Politics.hu|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Of the massacres perpetrated by the Hungarian occupational authorities in Yugoslavia, the raid in southern Bačka remains the most infamous.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=520}} The killings have been referred to as the Novi Sad massacre,{{sfn|Patai|1996|p=590}} the Újvidék massacre,{{sfn|Patai|1996|p=590}}{{sfn|Thomas|Szabo|2012|p=14}} or simply The Raid ({{lang-sh|Racija}}).{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=121}}{{sfn|Cornelius|2011|p=191}} In its aftermath, the historian Deborah S. Cornelius writes, "relations between Hungary and Serbia have never been the same." Decades hence, the raid continues to feature prominently in the Hungarian popular imagination, more so than most events from the war.{{sfn|Cornelius|2011|p=191}} It was depicted in Hungarian director [[András Kovács]]' 1966 film ''Cold Days'' ({{lang-hu|Hideg napok}}).{{sfn|Burns|1996|p=73}}{{sfn|Iordanova|2003|pp=76–79}} It features prominently in Yugoslav writer [[Danilo Kiš]]'s 1962 novel ''[[Psalm 44 (novel)|Psalm 44]]'' ({{lang-sh|Psalm 44}}) and his 1972 novel ''Hourglass'' ({{lang-sh|Peščanik}}).{{sfn|Thompson|2013|pp=3, 44–45}} The massacre held special significance for Kiš as his father was nearly killed during it.{{sfn|Mazower|2008|pp=329–330}}{{sfn|Thompson|2013|p=3}} The Yugoslav writer [[Aleksandar Tišma]], who narrowly escaped being rounded up and killed in the massacre, explored the topic in his 1972 novel ''The Book About Blam'' ({{lang-sh|Knjiga o Blamu}}).{{sfn|Neubauer|2006|p=231}}{{sfn|Thompson|2013|loc=p. 80, note 25}} It is also described in [[Tibor Cseres]]' 1991 book ''Blood Feud in Bačka'' ({{lang-hu|Vérbosszú Bácskában}}).{{sfn|Neubauer|2006|p=231}} In 1971, a commemorative statue by the sculptor Jovan Soldatović was erected in Novi Sad, on the spot where the bodies of victims were tossed into the Danube.&lt;ref name="RTV"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Radio Televizija Vojvodine|title=Napukao spomenik žrtvama Novosadske racije|url=http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/vojvodina/novi-sad/napukao-spomenik-zrtvama-novosadske-racije_382750.html|date=3 April 2013|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription at the base of the statue reads:{{sfn|Cymet|2010|p=355}}{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=52}}

''Sećanje je spomenik tvrđi od kamena. 
Ako smo ljudi oprostiti moramo, zaboraviti ne smemo.''
&lt;/poem&gt;

Memory is a monument harder than stone. 
If we are people, we must forgive, but not forget
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}  

Similar statues, also created by Soldatović, exist in Žabalj and Čurug.&lt;ref name="RTV"/&gt; Commemorative ceremonies are held annually in Novi Sad and the other massacre sites.{{sfn|Byford|2013|p=525}}

'''Noël''' (Noheli) '''Hitimana''' was a presenter (''animateur'') on the Rwandan radio station [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines]] (RTLM), which played a significant role in promoting the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. Like the station's [[RTLM#Individuals_associated_with_the_station|other broadcasters]], Hitimana incited violence against [[Tutsi]] on the air.&lt;ref name= "li 01"/&gt;

Prior to his employment at RTLM, Hitimana worked for [[MRND|state-owned]] [[Radio Rwanda]] and the ''Rwanda Bureau of Information and Broadcasting'' from the late 1970s until the early 1990s. During that time, he became popular by routinely greeting the different regions and towns of Rwanda in the early morning, while farmers were waking to work in the fields. This  broadcast segment emphasized both the importance of hard work, community and the [[Hutu Power|nationalistic]] views of the ruling [[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development]] (MRND). Allegedly an [[alcoholic]], Hitimana was fired from Radio Rwanda after insulting [[Rwandan President]] [[Juvénal Habyarimana]] on-air while intoxicated.&lt;ref name= "li 01"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Darryl |last2= |first2= |year=2004 |title=Echoes of violence: Considerations on radio and genocide in Rwanda. |journal=Journal of Genocide Research |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=25 |publisher= |doi= 10.1080/1462352042000194683|url=https://www.academia.edu/362149/Echoes_of_Violence_Considerations_on_Radio_and_Genocide_In_Rwanda |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his popularity throughout the country, Hitimana was one of the first ''animateurs'' hired by RTLM after its founding on 8 April 1993.&lt;ref name= "thompson 01"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Allan (Ed.) |authorlink= |title=The Media and the Rwanda Genocide |url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/IDRCBookDetails.aspx?PublicationID=131 |accessdate=19 March 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Pluto Press, Fountain Publishers, IDRC |location= |isbn=0-74532-625-0 |page=325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his trademark practice of greeting towns and individuals. Once the Rwandan Genocide began on 8 April 1994, Hitimana modified this habit into naming exact locations and names of alleged [[Rwandan Patriotic Front|RPF]] accomplices, inciting targeted violence and often murder on the named individuals by groups such as the [[Impuzamugambi]] and [[Interahamwe]] militias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cotton |first1=Cassandra |year=2007 |title='Where Radio is King:' Rwanda's Hate Radio and the Lessons Learned. |journal=Atlantic International Studies Journal |volume= |issue= |pages=4–11 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://atlismta.org/online-journals/0607-journal-gender-environment-and-human-rights/where-radio-is-king/#_ftn43 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segments by Hitimana made up about 5% of all RTLM broadcasts.&lt;ref name= "thompson 01"/&gt;{{rp|117}}

The studio of RTLM was hit by a bomb on 17 April 1994, with Hitimana being seriously injured. Following the attack, his leg was amputated, resulting in Hitimana leaving RTLM for good.&lt;ref name= "thompson 01" /&gt; Hitimana allegedly died in a Rwandan prison in or before 2002.&lt;ref name="li 01" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "hirondelle 01" /&gt;

'''Phannias ben Samuel''' (in [[Hebrew]]: פנחס בן שמואל ''Pinhas ben Shmuel'') (c. 70 CE) was the last [[Kohen Gadol|Jewish High Priest]], the 83rd since Aaron. He was from the 'tribe' of Eniachin (priestly order Jachin) and did not originate from one of the six families from whom high priests had traditionally been chosen.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, War, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leader of revolutionary forces and died during the destruction of [[Herod's Temple]] in 70 CE.

In order to see how far their power extended, the [[Zealot]]s 

{{quote|...undertook to dispose of the high priesthood by casting lots for it, whereas, as we have said already, it was to descend by succession in a family. The pretense they made for this strange attempt was an ancient practice, while they said that of old it was determined by lot; but in truth, it was no better than a dissolution of an undeniable law, and a cunning contrivance to seize upon the government, derived from those that presumed to appoint governors as they themselves pleased. Hereupon they sent for one of the pontifical tribes, which is called Eniachin, and cast lots which of it should be the high priest. By fortune the lot so fell as to demonstrate their iniquity after the plainest manner, for it fell upon one whose name was Phannias, the son of Samuel, of the village Aphtha. He was a man not only unworthy of the high priesthood, but that did not well know what the high priesthood was, such a mere rustic was he! Yet did they hail this man, without his own consent, out of the country, as if they were acting a play upon the stage, and adorned him with a counterfeit thee; they also put upon him the sacred garments, and upon every occasion instructed him what he was to do. This horrid piece of wickedness was sport and pastime with them, but occasioned the other priests, who at a distance saw their law made a jest of, to shed tears, and sorely lament the dissolution of such a sacred dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Jewish War]] |chapter=Book IV §151-158 |author=Josephus |year=c. 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6892">A '''portable collision avoidance system''' ('''PCAS''') is an [[aircraft collision avoidance systems|aircraft collision avoidance system]] similar in function to [[traffic collision avoidance system]] (TCAS). TCAS is the industry standard for commercial collision avoidance systems but PCAS is gaining recognition as an effective means of collision avoidance for general aviation and is in use the world over by independent pilots in personally owned or rented light aircraft as well as by flight schools and flying clubs.

Simply put PCAS allows pilots, particularly in single pilot [[Visual flight rules|VFR]] aircraft, a powerful additional instrument to augment their vision and [[situation awareness|situational awareness]] of other aircraft operating in their vicinity. A basic system will notify pilots of the nearest transponder equipped aircraft, its relative height and distance, and importantly if the distances are closing or increasing. More advanced systems can integrate with [[Electronic Flight Instrument System|EFIS]] overlaying nearby aircraft on the GPS map with relative height information. This information not only reduces pilot work loads in busy airspace but also helps pilots to hone their ability to spot nearby aircraft by alerting them when an aircraft is within a range that it might normally go unnoticed.

The original PCAS technology was developed in 1999 by Zane Hovey, a pilot and flight instructor, who also patented a portable ADS-b version as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country= USA |number= 8,072,374 |status= |title= Automatic dependent surveillance systems and methods |pubdate= 2011-12-06 |gdate       = 2011-12-06 |fdate= 2008-11-25 |pridate= |inventor= Zane Hovey |invent1= |invent2= |assign1= Zane Hovey |assign2= |class= 342/357.31 |url = https://patents.google.com/patent/US8072374B2/en?assignee=Zane+Hovey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this technology, transponder-equipped aircraft are detected and ranged, and the altitude is decoded. PCAS G4 technology has advanced to the point that highly accurate range, relative altitude, and 45 degree direction can be accurately detected in a portable cockpit device. PCAS gained notoriety with the growing popular TV series [[The Aviators (TV series)]] as a sponsor, and specifically in episode 6 airing on both PBS and the Discovery Channel Network. 

== Basic operation ==
[[Image:PCAS Xrx.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a PCAS device]]ATC ground stations and active TCAS systems transmit interrogation pulses on an uplink frequency of 1,030 megahertz. Aircraft transponders reply on a downlink frequency of 1,090 megahertz. PCAS devices detect these transponder responses, then analyze and display conflict information.

== Differences between PCAS and TCAS ==
PCAS is passive and less expensive than active aircraft detection systems, such as TCAS. While TCAS operates with more precision than PCAS but is also more expensive and usually requires in-aircraft installation whereas Typical PCAS systems do not. Another important difference is that TCAS gives mandatory instructions where PCAS only alerts the pilot and may give a suggestion as to how to act.

== Detailed operation ==

=== Step 1 ===

[[Image:PCAS Environment1.jpg|thumb|right|Step 1: Transponder interrogation by ground RADAR or active systems (TCAS)]]
To start the cycle, an interrogation is sent out from ground-based RADAR stations and/or TCAS or other actively interrogating systems in your area. This signal is sent on 1,030&amp;nbsp;MHz. For TCAS, this interrogation range can have a radius of 40 miles from the interrogation source. The Ground RADAR range can be 200 miles or more.

=== Step 2 ===

[[Image:PCAS Environment2.jpg|thumb|right|Step 2: Interrogation reply from transponder-equipped aircraft]]The transponder on any aircraft within range of the interrogation replies on 1090&amp;nbsp;MHz with their squawk code (known as mode A) and altitude code (or mode C). The altitude information is sent in an encoded format.

Mode S transponders also reply on this frequency, and encoded within the mode S transmission is the mode A (squawk) and mode C (altitude) information.

Military aircraft also respond on this frequency but use a different transmission protocol (see Step 3).

An aircraft's transponder should also reply. However, the XRX unit watches for this signal and will not report it as a threat aircraft. The unit may use this information to establish base altitude for use in step 4.

=== Step 3 ===

[[Image:PCAS Environment3.jpg|thumb|right|Step 3: PCAS computation of aircraft 3-axis information]]Any aircraft reply within the XRX detection window (maximum 6 miles) will be received. The range is computed based on the amplitude of the received signal, the altitude code is decoded, and the signal angle-of-arrival is determined to a resolution of "quadrants" (ahead, behind, left, or right) using a directional antenna array.&lt;ref name=ZaonXrxManual&gt;{{cite web|title=ZAON XRX owner's manual|url=http://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/pdf/xrxmanual.pdf|publisher=Zaon|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; XRX will recognize interrogations from TCAS, Skywatch, and any other "active" system, military protocols, and Mode S transmissions.

=== Step 4 ===

The altitude of the aircraft (in the example, 2,500&amp;nbsp;ft.) is compared to your local altitude (e.g., 1,500&amp;nbsp;ft.) and the relative altitude is calculated (e.g., 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft. above you). With relative direction, altitude and range determined, XRX displays this information and stores it in memory.

=== Step 5 ===

If additional aircraft are within detection range, the above process is repeated for each aircraft. The top threat is displayed on the left of the traffic screen and the second and third threats are displayed on the right.

The greatest threat is determined by looking at aircraft within the detection window you set up and comparing primarily the vertical separation (± relative altitude), and secondarily the range to the aircraft currently being displayed. XRX uses algorithms to determine which of two or more aircraft is a greater threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planeandpilotmag.com/products/tech-talk/zaon-pcas-xrx.html|title=Zaon PCAS XRX - Plane &amp; Pilot Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''School-based health centers (SBHCs)''' are [[primary care]] [[clinics]] based on primary and secondary school campuses in the [[United States]]. 
&amp;nbsp;Most SBHCs provide a combination of [[primary care]], [[Mental health professional|mental health care]], [[Substance abuse prevention|substance abuse counseling]], [[Medical case management|case management]], [[Dental public health|dental health]], [[Nutrition Education|nutrition education]], [[health education]] and [[health promotion]].  An emphasis is placed on prevention and early intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2011/12/health-centers12082011a.html |title=The Affordable Care Act and the School-Based Health Center Capital Program |publisher=HealthCare.gov |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  School-based health centers generally operate as a partnership between the school district and a community health organization, such as a community health center, hospital, or the local health department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsa.gov/ourstories/schoolhealthcenters/ |title=School-Based Health Centers |publisher=Hrsa.gov |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most SBHCs report that the majority of their student population is eligible for the National School Lunch program, a common indicator of low [[socioeconomic status]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolbasedhealthcare.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SBHCPP-Capstone-Evaluation-Report-2004-2010-Rev-Dec-2011-2.pdf |title=The School-Based Health Care Policy Program: Capstone Evaluation|publisher=American Public Health Association|date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1894, New York City officials initiated the first school health program in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, A. M., Reilly, M. B., Cetron, M. S., &amp; Markel, H. (2010). "Better off in school": School medical inspection as a public health strategy during the 1918-119 influenza pandemic in the United States. ''Public Health Reports, 125 (S3),'' 63-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to assess and, if needed, exclude children with contagious diseases from the classroom. In 1902, the program expanded and employed the nation’s first school nurse. As school health programs spread across the country, health screening and communicable disease control were their principal focus.
 
President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty in the mid-1960s is credited with bringing into focus the significance of health issues among impoverished school-age children.&lt;ref name="rwjf"&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Brodeurk |url=http://www.rwjf.org/files/publications/books/2000/chapter_01.html |title=School-Based Health Clinics |publisher=Rwjf.org |date=1986-11-07 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;The enactment of Medicaid in 1965 was indicative of a perception in the public policy community that there was a need to develop programs in service of better health care for low-income individuals, including children.

In 1967, Philip J. Porter, head of pediatrics at Cambridge City Hospital in Massachusetts and director of Maternal and Child Health for the city's health department, began to address this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Porter | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Avery | first2 = E. H. | last3 = Fellows | first3 = J. A. | year = 1974 | title = Model for the reorganization of child health services within an urban community | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 618–619 | doi=10.2105/ajph.64.6.618| pmc = 1775494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He assigned a nurse practitioner to work on site in an elementary school to deliver primary medical care to enrollees. Four additional health clinics were opened in Cambridge schools in the years that followed.&lt;ref name="rwjf" /&gt;

The first school-based health centers opened in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1967), Dallas, Texas (1970), and St. Paul, Minnesota (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lear | first1 = J. G. | last2 = Gleicher | first2 = H. B. | last3 = St | last4 = Germaine | first4 = A. | last5 = Porter | first5 = P.

In 1970, the West Dallas Youth Center at Pinkston High School was opened as an outreach center for a federally funded Children and Youth Program based in the University of Texas Health Sciences Center Pediatrics Department. Pinkston High School was the nation’s first high school to offer comprehensive care provided by nurse practitioners, physicians, social workers, nutritionists, and health educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lear | first1 = J. G. | year = 1996 | title = School-based services and adolescent health: Past, present and future | url = | journal = Adolescent Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 163–180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These early centers demonstrated that they were effective in increasing young people’s access to care.

==School Nurses in SBHC’s==
School nurses are an essential part of SBHC’s because they help prevent and reduce student absences in the educational institutions they are attending. The primary purpose of a school nurse is to ensure that students are healthy while maintaining good attendance. School nurses in SBHC’s display seven different characteristics that allow them to help students excel academically. A school nurse provides direct care to students, leadership for the facility of health services, screening and referral for health conditions, promotes health, and serves as a connection between parents, students, health care professionals and the larger community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Role of the School Nurse in Providing School Health Services|journal=Pediatrics|date=1 May 2008|volume=121|issue=5|pages=1052–1056|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-0382}}&lt;/ref&gt; The health services offered by the schools is determined by the different school districts. School nurses should provide certain services that meet the minimum requirement according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The minimum requirements include 
# care for students with special health care needs
# plan for managing emergencies
# health screening programs
# verification of immunizations 
# infectious disease reports
# a system to identify students chronic health care needs that can impact their educational achievement

==Current Status==
In the past 40 years, school-based health centers have grown from a handful to 1,909 in 45 states.&lt;ref name="nasbhc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasbhc.org/atf/cf/%7BB241D183-DA6F-443F-9588-3230D027D8DB%7D/NASBHC%202007-08%20CENSUS%20REPORT%20FINAL.PDF |title=School-based health centers: National census school year 2007-2008. |publisher=National Assembly on School-Based Health Care |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.

==Demographics and Characteristics==

SBHCs serve all school-levels: in elementary schools (20%), middle/junior high schools (15%), high schools (30%) and a mix of elementary, middle, and high schools (21%). They are located in urban (59%), rural (27%), and suburban (14%) communities in all regions of the country.&lt;ref name="nasbhc.org"/&gt; The centers often tailor their services and outreach specifically to the school's student population. Seventy percent of the student body in schools with SBHCs are minorities. They include Hispanic/Latino (36.8%), Black (non-Hispanic/Latino) (26.2%), Asian/Pacific Islander (4.4%), Native American/Alaskan Native (1.7%) and “other” (1.4%) youth.&lt;ref name="nasbhc.org"/&gt; Facilities are staffed by one or more different types of health care providers, including nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social workers, substance abuse counselors, and mental health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthinschools.org/Publications-and-Resources/Publications/Bibliographies/School-Based-Health-Centers-Bibliography.aspx |title=School-Based Health Centers Bibliography (Updated January 2012)|publisher=The Center for Health and Health Care in Schools |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Despite the growing number of school-based health care during the past three decades, the issue of providing reproductive health care at school-based health centers continues to spark controversy. Data has demonstrated how these controversies about reproductive health may frame more general concerns about school-based care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=  Community reactions to reproductive health care at three school-based clinics in Louisiana|date=2011-10-03 |pmid=8884662 |volume=66 |journal=J Sch Health |pages=237–41 | last1 = Zeanah | first1 = PD | last2 = Morse | first2 = EV | last3 = Simon | first3 = PM | last4 = Stock | first4 = M | last5 = Pratt | first5 = JL | last6 = Sterne | first6 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;In response to these issues, in recent years SBHCs have begun requiring parents to sign written consents for their children to receive the full array of services the centers provide.  Most facilities have an advisory board consisting of community representatives, parents, youth, and family organizations to provide planning and oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lphi.org/home2/section/3-30-32-90-92/role-and-benefits-of-sbhcs |title=Role and Benefits of SBHCs |publisher=LPHI |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
Historically, federal funding for school-based health centers came primarily from the maternal and child health block grant and the Healthy Schools/Healthy Communities program.  However, as SBHCs have begun to focus on third-party reimbursement, Medicaid has also become an important source of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/tgr/03/5/gr030505.html |title=School-Based Health Centers and the Birth Control Debate |publisher=Guttmacher.org |date=2000-10-01 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Center for Health and Health Care in Schools]], a grant program of the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], assisted states over the past two decades in developing the long-term financing policies required to sustain school-based health centers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rwjf.org/reports/grr/031658.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

About 20 percent of SBHCs receive funding through the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA) Health Center Program, a division of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsa.gov/ourstories/schoolhealthcenters/ |title=School-Based Health Centers |publisher=Hrsa.gov |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Other funding is derived from various sources such as community-based health centers, healthcare systems, foundation grants, and state and local funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/12/health/la-he-clinics-in-schools-20110912 |title=School-based health clinics play vital role in childrens' lives - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, $95 million was awarded to 278 school-based health center programs nationwide, as part of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]](PPACA). This was the first award in a series of allocations to the School-Based Health Center Capital Program.  PPACA's allocations for this program will ultimately total $200 million in funding for SBHCs over four years. The awards will enable recipients to expand their offerings and to increase their collective capacity by over 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/07/20110714grantee.html |title=School-Based Health Center Capital Program: July 2011 Grantees |publisher=Hhs.gov |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4457">The '''Second White Terror''' occurred in France in 1815.  Following the return of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] to power, people suspected of having ties with the governments of the [[French Revolution]] or of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] suffered arrest. Several hundred were killed by angry mobs, or executed after a quick trial at a drum head court-martial. &lt;ref&gt;Gwynn Lewis, "The White Terror of 1815 in the Department of the Gard: Counter-Revolution, Continuity and the Individual" ''Past &amp; Present'' No. 58 (Feb., 1973), pp. 108-135 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/650258 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Historian [[John B. Wolf]] argues that [[Ultra-royalist]]s—many of whom had just returned from exile—were staging a counter-revolution against the [[French Revolution]], and also against Napoleon's revolution.
:Throughout the Midi — in Provence, Avignon, Languedoc, and many other places — the White Terror raged with unrelenting ferocity. The royalists found in the willingness of the French to desert the king fresh proof of their theory that the nation was honeycombed with traitors, and used every means to seek out and destroy their enemies. The government was powerless or unwilling to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Baptiste Wolf|title=France: 1814-1919, the Rise of a Liberal-democratic Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRy-GYG8XzMC|year=1963|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period is named after the [[First White Terror]] that occurred during the French Revolution in 1795, when people identified as being associated with the [[Reign of Terror]] were harassed and killed.

==Bourbon reprisals==
{{see|Bourbon Restoration}}
[[File:La Mort du Maréchal Ney (1868).jpg|thumb|''[[The Execution of Marshal Ney]]'', 1868 painting by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]]]
After the Hundred Days, Napoleon's brief return to power in 1815, the second White Terror focused mainly on the purging of a civilian administration which had almost completely turned against the Bourbon monarchy. About 70,000 officials were dismissed from their positions. The remnants of the Napoleonic army was disbanded after the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and its senior officers cashiered. [[Marshal Ney]] was executed for treason, [[Guillaume Marie Anne Brune|Marshal Brune]] was killed in [[Avignon]], and General [[Jean-Pierre Ramel]] was assassinated in [[Toulouse]]. Approximately 6,000 individuals who had rallied to Napoleon were brought to trial. There were about 300 mob lynchings In the south of France,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' vol. 7, page 662&lt;/ref&gt; notably in Marseille where his [[Mamelukes]] were massacred in their barracks.

==Aftermath==
These actions struck fear in the population, persuading liberal and moderate electors (48,000 of the 72,000 voters eligible under the franchise in force) to vote for the [[ultra-royalists]]. Of 402 members, the first Chamber of the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] was composed of 350 ultra-royalists; the king himself thus named it the ''[[Chambre introuvable]]'' ("the Unobtainable Chamber"), called as such because the Chamber was "more royalist than the king" (''plus royalistes que le roi''), in Louis XVIII's words. The Chamber voted, sentencing [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]] and the [[Charles de la Bédoyère|Comte de la Bédoyère]] to death for treason, while 250 people were given prison sentences and some others exiled, including [[Joseph Fouché]], [[Lazare Carnot]], and [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès|Cambacérès]]. The surviving "regicides" who had voted for the execution of Louis XVI in 1792 were exiled.

Although the main ideology of the network is [[socialist feminist]], there are a variety of interpretations of [[feminism]] within the network and there are a number of [[radical feminists]] who are also members.

The SWN has existed since the beginning of the [[Scottish Socialist Party|SSP]], however was relatively small until the [[Scottish Socialist Party#SSP's role in the Sheridan libel trial|Sheridan crisis]] occurred.  The issues raised within that period of the party, together with the demonisation of leading women within the party led to a reinvigoration of the network and a renewed interest in feminist issues within the party.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redpepper.org.uk/Busy-being-reborn/&lt;/ref&gt;

The network has campaigned on issues as diverse as [[sweatshops]], female [[deaths in custody]], [[right to choose]], [[prostitution]], [[sexual violence]] and the rights of [[immigrant|migrant]] women.  It holds a regular event on [[International Women's Day]] and organises dayschools and residential weekends which are open to all women interested in [[feminist]] issues to meet up and discuss current issues in feminism and women's rights, both in formal and informal settings.

'''Soft coup''' is a [[coup d'état]] without the use of violence, but based on a conspiracy or plot that has as its objective the taking of state power by partially or wholly illegal means, in order to operate an exchange of political leadership - and in some cases also of the current institutional order.&lt;ref name=softcoup&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docsearch.pdfee.org/th1intr.html|title=What coups d’État are|author=Roberto Scaruffi|work=The mechanics of the political destabilisation and Constitutional subversion in the 1990s’ Italy|access-date=2018-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222253/http://docsearch.pdfee.org/th1intr.html#|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2012/0620/Military-soft-coup-in-Egypt-has-precedent|title=Military soft 'coup' in Egypt has precedent|publisher= CSMonitor.com|author= Steven A. Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
A soft coup is a strategy attributed to the American political scientist [[Gene Sharp]], a Professor Emeritus of political science at the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] nominee, who has been a theorist and author of groundbreaking works on the dynamics of nonviolent conflict. He studied the potential to spark, guide, and maximize the power of sometimes short-lived mass uprisings, as he tried to understand how unarmed insurrections have been far more politically significant than observers focused on military warfare have cared to admit.&lt;ref name="Sharp"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-machiavelli-of-nonviolence-gene-sharp-and-the-battle-against-corporate-rule|title= The Machiavelli of Nonviolence: Gene Sharp and the Battle Against Corporate Rule|author= Engler, Mark |date= 2013|publisher= Dissent Magazine|accessdate=February 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Axel Kaiser, a Chilean lawyer member of the [[Mises Institute]], soft coup is nothing but a [[conspiracy theory]] used by Latin American populists who seek the centralization of power, but do so under the pretense of improving democracy. Kayser argues that the Latin American leaders rationale is that democracy should be a system where the [[general will]] must be absolute, and that the populist leader describes himself as the representative of the general will by virtue of having been elected by the people. Kayser says that these leaders feel that the will of the leader equals the general will, and that any limits on the will of the leader would be also a limit to the general will itself.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In this scenario, opposition to the leader is supposedly treated as an act against democracy, which would be used to justify persecution of the opposition, forced [[nationalization]]s and limits to the [[freedom of the press]]&lt;ref name="Kaiser55"&gt;Kaiser, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; - a notion of democracy that is opposed to the one held in the United States, which considers instead that rulers must have limits to their power,&lt;ref name="Kaiser55" /&gt; but also conflicting with [[minority rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

As several military coups took place in [[South America]] during the [[20th century]], in particular during the [[Cold War]], there is a strong popular perception of those coups as highly negative events. The mere legacy of [[Operation Condor]] evokes great mistrust among the general population. Hence, as the supporters of the deposed leaders often attribute the old coups to generalized authors instead of specific ones (such as the press, the [[private sector]] of the economy, the judiciary and [[imperialism]]), they tend to argue that the alleged coups have been attempted by those same authors.&lt;ref name="notcoup"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21696550-how-should-presidential-systems-deal-political-breakdown-when-coup-not-coup|title= When a "coup" is not a coup|author= |date= April 9, 2016|publisher= The Economist|accessdate=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Navajo People and Uranium Mining''''' (2006) is a non-fiction book edited by Doug Brugge, Timothy Benally, and Esther Yazzie-Lewis; it uses oral histories to tell the stories of [[Navajo Nation]] families and miners in the [[uranium mining]] industry. The foreword is written by [[Stewart L. Udall]], former U.S. [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]].&lt;ref name=brug&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1852667 |author=Alexandra C.

''The Navajo People and Uranium Mining'' has 12 chapters. Seven chapters contain stories of the Navajo told through interviews of the miners or their families. The remaining chapters describe the health effects related to [[uranium]] mining, and "how these medical issues adversely affected the lives of the miners and their families".&lt;ref name=brug/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/oral_history_review/v036/36.1.richter.html "'The Navajo People and Uranium Mining' (review)"], ''[[Oral History Review]]'', Volume 36, Number 1, Winter/Spring 2009, pp. 141-143&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15026">'''Tobacco 21''' is a national campaign aimed at raising the minimum legal age (MLA) for tobacco and nicotine sales in the [[United States]] to 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preventing Tobacco Addiction Foundation - About US|url=http://tobacco21.org/preventing-tobacco-addiction-foundation/|website=Tobacco 21|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tobacco 21 campaign is produced and funded by the [[Preventing Tobacco Addiction Foundation]], a public health nonprofit organization established in 1996. Tobacco 21 produces online content to promote anti-tobacco messages and helps communities around the United States raise the [[tobacco]] and [[nicotine]] sales age to 21.

Several national non-profit organizations,  including the [[American Cancer Society]] in [[Oregon]],&lt;ref name="American Cancer Society Wants Oregon to Raise Tobacco Age"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MyCentralOregon.com|title= American Cancer Society Wants Oregon to Raise Tobacco Age|url=http://www.mycentraloregon.com/2016/03/18/american-cancer-society-wants-oregon-to-raise-tobacco-age/ |website=MyCentralOregon.com|accessdate=1 June 2016|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have showed their support for raising the tobacco and nicotine sales age to 21 in different states.

==History==

Established in 1996, the Preventing Tobacco Addiction Foundation strives to reduce the terrible toll of smoking and tobacco use through a preventive effort.

== Mission ==
Early exposure permanently alters neuro-receptors in the deepest, most ancient parts of the brain that then manifests as ongoing desire or addiction.  Preventing that early inoculation requires a concerted societal and political strategy including school-based education, reduced media exposure, counter-marketing, tobacco and smoke free homes and public areas and youth access restrictions.  Tobacco 21 vigorously supports all of those efforts in addition to our focus on raising the legal minimum sales age to 21.

== Scientific Support ==
The major scientific publication in support of Tobacco 21 is the Institute of Medicine's report "[https://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2015/TobaccoMinAge/tobacco_minimum_age_report_brief.pdf Public Health Implications of Raising the Minimum Age of Legal Access to Tobacco Products]", which concluded by saying:" if the MLA were raised now to 21 nationwide, there would be approximately 223,000 fewer premature deaths, 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer, and 4.2 million fewer years of life lost for those born between 2000 and 2019."

An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine called Tobacco 21 "[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1314626#t=article An idea whose time has come]".

==Endorsements==
The following organizations have endorsed Tobacco 21 at the national level, either through their own statements or through endorsement of Senate Bill 2100, the federal act to raise the tobacco age to 21:

==National movements==

===Hawaii===
Hawaii’s Tobacco 21 bill was signed by Governor [[David Ige]] and raised the legal age to purchase tobacco products, including electronic smoking devices, to 21, beginning on January 1, 2016.&lt;ref name="Hawaii to change legal age for tobacco sales to 21 on Jan. 1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pacific Business News|title= Hawaii to change legal age for tobacco sales to 21 on Jan. 1 |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2015/12/29/hawaii-to-change-legal-age-for-tobacco-sales-to-21.html|website=Pacific Business News|accessdate=1 June 2016|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation of this bill arose after the [[Institute of Medicine]] released a report explaining that raising the age to 21 would have significant public health benefits. The report estimated that making the minimum age 21 would result in avoiding nearly 250,000 premature deaths and 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer among individuals born between 2000-2019.

Under the bill, anyone caught breaking the law faces a $10 fine for the first offense and a $50 fine or community service for a second offense. Retailers caught selling to individuals under the age of 21 pay penalties ranging from $500-$2,000.

A press release on the governor’s website explained the decision by referencing that in the United States, 95 percent of adults smokers begin smoking before the age of 21. Almost half of those become regular smokers before the age of 18 and another 25% become regular smokers between the ages of 18-21.&lt;ref name="SB1030 SD1 HD2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=CNN|title= Hawaii set to become first state to raise smoking age to 21 Sheet|url=http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/Archives/measure_indiv_Archives.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=1030&amp;year=2015
|website=CNN|accessdate=1 June 2016|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===

California became the second state to implement a statewide Tobacco 21 law. Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed a group of bills on May 4, 2016.&lt;ref name="California's smoking age raised from 18 to 21 under bills signed by Gov. Brown"&gt;{{cite web|last1=LA Times|title= California's smoking age raised from 18 to 21 under bills signed by Gov. Brown |url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-jerry-brown-smoking-bills-20160504-story.html|website=LA Times|accessdate=1 June 2016|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pack of bills were described as the “most expansive” attempt to regulate tobacco use within the state of California in over a decade. The bills were supported by various organizations and medical groups including the [[American Heart Association]], [[American Cancer Society]], [[American Lung Association]], and [[California Medical Association]]. The bill was approved in a special health care session and became effective on June 9, 2016.

==Local movements==

===New York City===
In November 2013, [[New York City]] enacted legislation that raised the age to purchase tobacco products to 21, and also set a minimum price of $10.50 per pack of cigarettes, among other provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Law Prohibiting Sale of Cigarettes, Tobacco Products and Electronic Cigarettes to People Under Age 21 in New York City What You Need to Know|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/smoke/tobacco-21-faq.pdf|website=New York City|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law went into effect on May 18, 2014.
The bill came with significant penalties for those who do not comply with the law. Failure to post required signage can result in fines of up to $500. Sales of cigarettes, other tobacco products or electronic cigarettes to people under age 21 can result in New York City fines of up to $1,000 for the first violation and any other violation found that same day, and up to $2,000 for the second violation and any subsequent violation within three years. A second violation may result in revocation of the cigarette retail dealer license. New York State may impose additional fines and penalties for sales of these products to people under age 18.

===Boston===
In December 2015, [[Boston]] followed New York City by passing an ordinance to raise the tobacco sales age to 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellement|first1=John|title=Boston raises tobacco-buying age to 21|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/12/18/boston-raises-age-buy-tobacco-and-smoking-related-products/qm0KH9VAN9KsJLAwbROyRM/story.html|website=Boston Globe|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boston's Tobacco 21 law went into effect on February 15, 2016.

===Chicago===
In March 2016, [[Chicago]] passed its Tobacco 21 ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Raises Tobacco-Buying Age to 21|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Chicago-City-Council-Approves-Raising-Tobacco-Buying-Age-to-21-372239372.html|website=NBC Chicago|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law will go into effect on July 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Chicago :: Tobacco Regulations|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/bacp/supp_info/tobaccoregulations.html|website=www.cityofchicago.org|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kansas City===
[[Kansas City]] approved its Tobacco 21 bill on November 19, 2015 and quickly put it into effect a week later on November 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KC, Wyandotte County raise legal age for tobacco purchases to 21|url=http://www.kansascity.com/living/health-fitness/article45537861.html|website=Kansas City Star|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleveland===
In December 2015, [[Cleveland]] passed a local ordinance to ban the sale of tobacco and nicotine products to any persons under the age of 21. The law went into effect on April 14, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cleveland bans tobacco, e-cigarette sales to people under 21|url=http://www.cleveland.com/cityhall/index.ssf/2015/12/cleveland_bans_tobacco_e-cigar.html|website=cleveland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Francisco===
In March 2016, [[San Francisco]] joined the ranks of major American cities to pass an ordinance to raise the tobacco and nicotine sales age to 21.&lt;ref name="San Francisco raises smoking age to 21"&gt;{{cite web|last1=CNN|title=San Francisco raises smoking age to 21|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/health/san-francisco-smoking-age-21/ |website=CNN|accessdate=1 June 2016|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinance went into effect on June 1, 2016. Eight days later, California's Tobacco 21 bill went into effect statewide

== International movements ==
A similar organization, named [http://www.tobacco21.ca Tobacco21.ca], has the aim of increasing the legal age for buying tobacco products in Canada to 21.

The '''Vice President of Uruguay''' is the person with the second highest position in the executive branch of the Uruguayan government, after the President of Uruguay. The Vice President replaces the elected President in case of his death or absence. As long as the President is in his functions, the Vice President is the president of the [[Senate of Uruguay|Chamber of Senators]] and of the [[General Assembly of Uruguay|General Assembly]].

The position of Vice-President of the Republic was established in the [[Constitution of Uruguay of 1934|Constitution of 1934]]. Previously the President of the Senate assumed the Presidency in case of vacancy of the President. The [[Constitution of Uruguay of 1952|Constitution of 1952]] established a 9-member executive council, the [[National Council of Government (Uruguay)|National Council of Government]], abolishing the figure of the Vice President. The [[Constitution of Uruguay of 1967|Constitution of 1967]] eliminates the National Council of Government and resumes the presidential system, maintaining the figure of the Vice President.

The '''Wangjaesan Light Music Band''' ({{Korean|hangul=왕재산 경음악단|mr=Wangjaesan Kyŏngŭmaktan|context=north}}) is a [[light music (North Korea)|light music]] (''gyeongeumak'') group in [[North Korea]]. It is one of two (with [[Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble]]) popular music groups that were established by North Korea in the 1980s, both named after places where [[Kim Il-sung]] fought the Japanese in 1930s.&lt;ref name="O'ConnellCastelo-Branco2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Morgan O'Connell|author2=Salwa El-Shawan Castelo-Branco|title=Music and Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99I7xvnA6KIC&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=22 July 2012|date=23 September 2010|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-07738-8|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes its name from [[Mount Wangjae]] in [[Onsong-gun]], [[North Hamgyong Province]], on the border with [[People's Republic of China|China]], where [[Kim Il-sung]] is said to have held a meeting for anti-Japanese activities in 1933.

The band was established by the North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]] on 22 July 1983. Its music was often broadcast over [[Media of North Korea|Korean Central Broadcasting Station]] channels such as [[Voice of Korea|Radio Pyongyang]]. The Wangjaesan Dance Troupe is part of the group.&lt;ref name="Art Troupe 2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kfausa.org/wangjaesan-art-troupe-gives-performance-to-mark-mother%e2%80%b2s-day/ | title=Wangjaesan Art Troupe Gives Performance to Mark Mother′s Day | publisher=Korean Friendship Association | date=November 15, 2012 | accessdate=2013-06-03 | author=Tommy Seilheimer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alleged executions and disbandment ==
On 29 August 2013, ''[[The Chosun Ilbo]]'' reported that key members of the Wangjaesan Light Music Band were made to watch the [[execution by firing squad]] of other musicians and dancers from their band, as well as members of the [[Unhasu Orchestra]] and the singer [[Hyon Song-wol]], on the orders of [[Kim Jong-un]]. The Wangjaesan Light Music Band was subsequently disbanded.&lt;ref name=chosunilboaug2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/29/2013082901412.html|title=Kim Jong-un's Ex-Girlfriend 'Shot by Firing Squad'|date=August 29, 2013|accessdate=August 29, 2013|work=The Chosun Ilbo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts however were dubious of this claim, such as [[Barbara Demick]], author of ''[[Nothing to Envy]]''. Demick told ''Business Insider'' "...it is hard to trust this stuff. A lot of deliberate misinformation out there." Chad O'Carroll of NK News, a North Korean analyst website, stated: "You've got to remember that a lot of the time the source is South Korean and it's in their interest to distort or perhaps weave the truth every now and then".&lt;ref name=businessinsideraug2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/did-kim-jong-un-execute-his-ex-girlfriend-2013-8#ixzz2e8YQ937U|title=Why You Shouldn't Necessarily Trust Those Reports Of Kim Jong-un Executing His Ex-Girlfriend|date=August 29, 2013|accessdate=August 29, 2013|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Delury from the [[Yonsei University]] in Seoul told ''The Guardian'': "This stuff gets planted regularly in media outlets and then quickly goes viral. There's a global appetite for any North Korea story and the more salacious the better. Some of it is probably true — but a great deal of it is probably not". Delury also added: "The normal standards of journalism are thrown out of the window because the attitude is: 'It's North Korea — no one knows what's going on in there'".&lt;ref name=theguardiansept2013&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/23/north-korea-reptile-media-kim-jongun|title=North Korea criticises 'reptile media' for saying Kim Jong-un ordered executions|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=September 28, 2013|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyon Song-wol]] was later shown to be alive.&lt;ref name="North Korean singer rumoured to have been executed appears on TV"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/17/north-korean-singer-rumoured-executed-appears-tv | title=North Korean singer rumoured to have been executed appears on TV | publisher=Agence France-Presse via The Guardian website | date=14 May 2014 | accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Korean reports came approximately a month after the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee had issued a message of anniversary congratulations to the troupe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kcnawatch.co/newstream/1451900619-433416936/wpk-congratulates-wangjaesan-art-troupe/ WPK Congratulates Wangjaesan Art Troupe] (22 July 2013) KCNA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reappearance==
In 2015, the band reunited for the "Songs Full of Memories" concert series (February-March) and the joint performance "Great Party, Rosy Korea" in October.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2015/201510/news14/20151014-16ee.html&lt;/ref&gt;
