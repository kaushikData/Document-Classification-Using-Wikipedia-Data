[[File:1940 Field Marshal Ceremony.gif|right|thumb|300px|Hitler posing with his field marshals at the ceremony. [[Hermann Göring|Göring]] wears the white uniform.]]
The '''1940 Field Marshal Ceremony''' refers to a promotion ceremony held at the [[Kroll Opera House]] in [[Berlin]] in which [[Adolf Hitler]] promoted twelve [[general]]s to the rank of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' ("[[field marshal]]") on 19 July 1940. It was the first occasion in [[World War II]] that Hitler appointed field marshals due to military achievements.

The prestigious rank of field marshal had been banned after the [[First World War]]. As part of  [[German re-armament]], the rank was revived. Hitler promoted twelve selected generals to field marshal during the ceremony in Berlin for their role in the swift victory in the [[Battle of France]] and to raise morale. The ceremony highlighted the power and prestige of the [[Wehrmacht]]; France was considered to have had [[Military history of France during World War II|the strongest army in Europe]], yet had been humiliatingly defeated in just six weeks. The ceremony was the first time Hitler appointed field marshals due to military achievements and was celebrated like no other promotion ceremony of the war.

During the same ceremony, [[Hermann Göring|Göring]], already ''Generalfeldmarschall'' since 1938, was promoted to the newly-created rank, especially for him, of ''[[Reichsmarschall]]''.

==Field marshal==
{{main|Generalfeldmarschall}}
[[File:Von Kluge marshal's baton.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A decorated baton became the trademark of a German field marshal.]]
After World War I, the prestigious rank of field marshal was banned in the [[Weimar Republic]], alongside other restrictions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. After Hitler and the [[Nazi Party]] came to national power in January 1933, they began an expansion of the military; it was part of Hitler's desire to restore the army's power and prestige.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|pp=26–27}} In 1936, he revived the rank of field marshal. It was the highest and most prestigious military rank in Germany, originally only for the use of the [[Minister of War]] and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Army.{{sfn|Hakim|1995|pp=100–104}} The traditional attribute distinguishing a German field marshal was an ornately decorated baton.{{sfn|Alford|2003|pp=66–67}} More tangible benefits included a yearly salary of 36,000 [[Reichsmarks]] for life (a Field Marshal was considered to ever remain on active duty) and all earnings being exempt from income tax.{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=111}}

Flushed with enthusiasm by the swift defeat of the French army, considered to have been the strongest in Europe,{{sfn|Rees|2012}} and the Low Countries in June 1940, Hitler wanted to mark the occasion with a grand promotion ceremony.{{sfn|Mitcham|2009|p=24}} He also hoped the promotions would strengthen his influence over the traditional [[German General Staff]].{{sfn|Snyder|1994|pp=111–112}} The twelve generals chosen for promotion, who all had played an important role in the victory, were (with the position they occupied during the Battle of France):

* [[Generaloberst|Colonel General]] [[Walther von Brauchitsch]]{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=112}}, Commander-in-chief of the Army
* Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]]{{sfn|Turney|1971|p=6}}, Commander of Army Group B
* [[General der Flieger|General of the Aviators]] [[Albert Kesselring]]{{sfn|Kesselring|1970|p=55}}, Commander of Air Fleet 2
* Colonel General [[Wilhelm Keitel]]{{sfn|Sandler|2002|p=455}}, Chief of Staff of Hitler's Armed Forces High Command and ''de facto'' Minister for War
* Colonel General [[Günther von Kluge]]{{sfn|Moczarski|1981|pp=226–234}}, Commander of the 4th Army
* Colonel General [[Wilhelm von Leeb]]{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=647}}, Commander of Army Group C
* Colonel General [[Wilhelm List]]{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=28}}, Commander of the 12th Army
* Colonel General [[Erhard Milch]]{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=229}}, Chief Under-Secretary of State in the Reich Aviation Ministry (de facto Air Force High Command)
* Colonel General [[Walther von Reichenau]]{{sfn|Biesinger|2006|p=619}}, Commander of the 6th Army
* Colonel General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]{{sfn|Mackenzie|2014|p=17}}, Commander of Army Group A
* General of the Aviators [[Hugo Sperrle]]{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=46}}, Commander of Air Fleet 3
* Colonel General [[Erwin von Witzleben]]{{sfn|Mitcham|2009a|pp=1–2}}, Commander of the 1st Army

In particular, all Army Group commanders were promoted Field Marshal. In the case of Kesselring and Sperrle, the rank of Colonel General was bypassed. The commanders-in-chief of Navy and Air Force, [[Erich Raeder]] and [[Hermann Göring]] respectively, were not promoted Field Marshals because they already held the rank (or its equivalent [[Grand Admiral]] respectively). Given that Field Marshal was no longer as exceptional a rank as it was before, Göring, however, to satisfy his thirst for prestige, was promoted to the specially created rank of [[Reichsmarschall|Reich Marshal]]. This made Göring the senior officer of the military, without, however, making him an actual superior of Army and Navy. It was the only award of this rank during the Nazi era, and it was abolished after the fall of the Nazi regime. &lt;ref&gt;''Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', by William L. Shirer. Published 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; {{sfn|Manvell|2011|p=245}}

On 19 July 1940, Hitler summoned the generals to a ceremony in Berlin's [[Kroll Opera House]] (which housed the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] after the [[Reichstag fire]]).{{sfn|Deighton|2008|pp=7–9}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=122–123}}{{sfn|Mitcham|2009|p=24}} After a speech regarding a peace proposal directed at Britain, Hitler personally rewarded his generals with their expensively decorated batons,{{sfn|Deighton|2008|pp=7–9}}{{sfn|Alford|2003|pp=66–67}} and thanked them for their contributions to the victory.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=322}}{{sfn|Ellis|1993|p=94}}

The 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony was the first occasion Hitler appointed field marshals due to military achievements and was celebrated like no other promotion ceremony in Germany.{{sfn|Mitcham|2009|p=24}}{{sfn|Tague|2011|p=150}} The remaining five years of the war saw an additional [[List of German field marshals#Nazi Germany|twelve promotions]], most of which were without ceremony, such as [[Friedrich Paulus]]'s promotion, which was conferred over the radio by Hitler.{{sfn|Beevor|1998|p=381}}{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=112}}{{efn
| name = Paulus incident
| 1=In deciding to promote Paulus during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], Hitler noted that there was no known record of a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] or German field marshal ever having surrendered. The implication was clear: Paulus was to commit suicide. If Paulus surrendered, Hitler implied he would shame Germany's military history. Paulus, nevertheless, surrendered to Soviet forces on 31 January 1943, the day after he was promoted.{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=112}}
}}

==Aftermath==
All of the generals promoted went on to achieve further success in their careers during the early years of victory which the German military obtained in the Second World War. Brauchitsch, Bock, Kesselring, Keitel, Leeb, List, Reichenau, Rundstedt, and Göring would all play decisive and important roles in the German-led [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941.{{sfn|Grazhdan|2011}} Sperrle spent the rest of the war in semi-retirement, based with his unit in France.{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=46}} Milch was transferred to the production department and was responsible for aircraft production until the end of the war. In 1943, after a series of German defeats on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and the Allied invasion of [[Italy]], the German military lost all initiative.{{sfn|Rees|2012}} Hitler's leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against Germany, with the military's defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions.{{sfn|Rees|2012}} His response to the worsening war situation was to unceremoniously sack general after general, a routine which ultimately affected the field marshals promoted at the ceremony.{{sfn|Rees|2012}} [[Erwin von Witzleben]] and [[Günther von Kluge]] were both involved in the [[20 July Plot]] to assassinate Hitler. After it became clear that the assassination attempt had failed, Kluge committed suicide by taking [[cyanide|cyanide poison]] on 17 August 1944.{{sfn|Moczarski|1981|pp=226–234}} Witzleben, who was to become Commander-in-Chief of the [[Wehrmacht]] if the attempt had succeeded, was arrested and sentenced to death; the execution was carried out on 8 August 1944.{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=382}}

Nearly half of Australia's mangrove forests are found in [[Queensland]] (44% of Australia's total), followed by the [[Northern Territory]] (37%) and [[Western Australia]] (17%).&lt;ref name=DAFF/&gt;

In Western Australia, populations of mangroves are scattered down the coast; the population of the [[Houtman Abrolhos|Abrolhos Islands]] is 300 kilometres south of the nearest population of [[Shark Bay]], and the population at [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]] is even further south than this (500&amp;nbsp;km). The Bunbury colonisation may have occurred relatively recently, perhaps only several thousand years ago, with [[propagule]]s transferred by the [[Leeuwin Current]].&lt;ref name = "Rippey"&gt;{{cite book |last= Rippey|first=Elizabeth |author2=Rowland, Barbara |title=Coastal plants: Perth and the south-west region |origyear=1995 |edition= 2nd |year=2004 |publisher=[[University of Western Australia|UWA]] Press |location= Perth |isbn= 1-920694-05-6|chapter= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most inland occurrence of mangroves in Australia is a stand of grey mangroves in the [[Mandora Marsh]], some 60&amp;nbsp;km from the coast.

Australian mangrove forests comprise 45 plant species from 18 families, which is more than half the world's mangrove species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = World Mangrove ID: expert information at your fingertips|last = Duke|first = Norman|publisher = MangroveWatch Publications|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-9923659-0-5|location = Brisbane|pages = |url = https://research.jcu.edu.au/tropwater/research-programs/australian-mangrove-and-saltmarsh-network}}&lt;/ref&gt; One tree species, ''Avicennia integra'', is found only in Australia - in the Northern Territory, east of Darwin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 
Each mangrove tree species is specific to particular latitudes and levels of tidal inundation.&lt;ref name=DAFF/&gt; The greatest diversity of species is found in the far northern and north-eastern areas of Australia, and declines rapidly with increasing latitude.&lt;ref name="SuSa"&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://epubs.scu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1664&amp;context=esm_pubs|last = Suzuki|first = Kunio|last2 = Saeger|first2 = Peter|title = A phytosociological study of mangrove vegetation in Australia with a latitudinal comparison of East Asia|journal = School of Environmental Science and Management Papers|publisher = Southern Cross University ePublications@SCU|year = 1996|accessdate = 23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Darwin Harbour, in the north of Australia, contains 36 mangrove tree species,&lt;ref name="DIPE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/nature/pdf/mangroves/2003_mangrove_education_pack.pdf |publisher=Northern Territory Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Environment |title=Mangroves in the Northern Territory Report Number 25/2003D |year=2003 |accessdate=26 January 2011 |last=Lee |first=Geraldine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110329151107/http://nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/nature/pdf/mangroves/2003_mangrove_education_pack.pdf |archivedate=29 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Bunbury, in the south, contains only one mangrove tree species. There are no mangroves in Tasmania.&lt;ref name=DIPE/&gt;

The most widespread and common mangrove tree in Australia is the grey mangrove or white mangrove (''[[Avicennia marina]]'').&lt;ref name=DAFF/&gt;

Mangrove forests also support several salt-tolerant plant species which are not classed as mangroves. In tropical areas, this may include the mangrove palm (''[[Nypa fruticans]]''), the mangrove fern (''[[Acrostichum speciosum]]''), and orchids which grow as [[epiphyte]]s on the trunks and branches of mangrove trees.&lt;ref name="DAFF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry , Bureau of Rural Sciences – Australian Forest Profiles: Mangroves |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/brs/publications/series/forest-profiles/australian_forest_profiles_mangroves |accessdate=23 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316103324/http://www.daff.gov.au/brs/publications/series/forest-profiles/australian_forest_profiles_mangroves |archivedate=16 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other plants found in association with mangroves include the mangrove lily (''[[Crinum pedunculatum]]'').&lt;ref name="AIMS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aims.gov.au/source/publications/marine-science-info/pdf/field-guide-tothe-mangroves-of-qld.pdf |publisher=Australian Institute of Marine Science |title=Field Guide to the Mangroves of Queensland |year=1993 |accessdate=23 January 2011 |last=Lovelock |first=Catherine |last2=Clarke |first2=Steve |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218033549/http://www.aims.gov.au/source/publications/marine-science-info/pdf/field-guide-tothe-mangroves-of-qld.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangrove forests share the high intertidal zone niche with coastal or intertidal [[salt marsh|saltmarshes]]; plant communities dominated by salt-resistant or salt-tolerant herbs and low shrubs.&lt;ref name = "Saintilan"&gt;{{Cite book | editor = Neil Saintilan | title = Australian Saltmarsh Ecology | publisher=[[CSIRO Publishing]] | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-643-09371-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated fauna==

Mangrove forests provide breeding nurseries for a wide range of fish and crustaceans, including many species of commercial and recreational value, for example, barramundi (''[[Lates calcarifer]]''), mangrove jack (''[[Mangrove red snapper|Lutjanus argentimaculatus]]''), [[Scylla serrata|mud crabs (''Scylla serrata'')]] and banana prawn (''[[Penaeus merguinensis]]'').&lt;ref name=DAFF/&gt; The forests also provide a habitat for spat settlement and development of oyster species.&lt;ref name="PIF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/28_9126.htm |title=Primary Industries and Fisheries, Qld Government – Common Mangroves |accessdate=23 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106180309/http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/28_9126.htm |archivedate=6 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many terrestrial fauna, such as insects, reptiles, frogs, birds and mammals, use mangroves for food, shelter, breeding and feeding grounds.&lt;ref name = DIPE/&gt;

The rusty monitor (''[[Varanus semiremex]]'') shelters in the hollows of mature or dead mangrove trees in north-eastern Queensland.&lt;ref name =DAFF/&gt; The mangrove snake (''[[Fordonia leucobalia]]'') and estuarine crocodile (''[[Saltwater crocodile|Crocodylus porosus]]'') are found in mangrove forests in the north.

The lesser noddy (''[[Anous tenuirostris melanops]]'') builds a platform nest of leaves in mangrove trees. This bird is listed as vulnerable under Australia’s [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]].&lt;ref name =DAFF/&gt;

Mangrove forests provide habitat for many small insectivorous birds, including the [[Lichenostomus versicolor|varied honeyeater]], [[Lichenostomus fasciogularis|mangrove honeyeater]], [[Conopophila albogularis|rufous-banded honeyeater]], [[Peneonanthe pulverulenta|mangrove robin]], [[Microeca flavigaster|lemon-bellied flycatcher]], [[Poecilodryas cerviniventris|buff-sided robin]], [[Colluricincla megarhyncha|little shrike-thrush]] [[Pachycephala simplex|grey whistler]], [[Pachycephala lanioides|white-breasted whistler]], [[Rhipidura rufiventris|northern fantail]], [[Rhipidura phasiana|mangrove grey fantail]], [[Rhipidura dryas|Arafura fantail]], [[Myiagra ruficollis|broad-billed flycatcher]], [[Myiagra alecto|shining flycatcher]], [[Monarcha trivirgatus|spectacled monarch]], [[Monarcha leucotis|white-eared monarch]] and [[Zosterops luteus|yellow white-eye]].&lt;ref name = "S&amp;D"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Simpson | first1 = Ken | first2 = Nicolas | last2 = Day | first3 = Peter | last3 = Trusler | title = Field Guide to the Birds of Australia 7th Edition | publisher=Penguin Group (Australia) | year= 2004 | isbn = 0-670-04180-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other bird species observed to frequent mangrove forests are the [[Ptilinopus regina|rose-crowned fruit-dove]], [[Chalcites minutillus|little bronze-cuckoo]], [[Podargus papuensis|Papuan frogmouth]], [[Alcedo azurea|azure kingfisher]], [[Alcedo pusilla|little kingfisher]], [[Todiramphus macleayii|forest kingfisher]], [[Todiramphus sordidus|Torresian kingfisher]], [[Todiramphus sanctus|sacred kingfisher]] and [[Chlamydera cerviniventris|fawn-breasted bowerbird]].&lt;ref name = S&amp;D/&gt;

Mangrove forests are sometimes used as nursery areas by [[Pteropus|flying foxes]] in the Darwin Harbour&lt;ref name = DIPE/&gt; and other areas of Australia. Several species, including the [[Pteropus scapulatus|little red flying fox]], are dependent on mangrove pollen as food.&lt;ref name = DIPE/&gt;

==Economic values==

Mangroves protect coastal areas from erosion, storm surge, and tsunamis.&lt;ref name="Mazda-2"&gt;Mazda, Y.; Kobashi, D. and Okada, S. (2005) "Tidal-Scale Hydrodynamics within Mangrove Swamps" ''Wetlands Ecology and Management'' 13(6): pp. 647–655&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Danielsen"&gt;Danielsen, F. ''et al.'' (2005) "The Asian tsunami: a protective role for coastal vegetation" ''Science'' 310: p. 643.&lt;/ref&gt; The massive root systems of mangroves are efficient at dissipating wave energy.&lt;ref name="Massel"&gt;Massel, S. R.; Furukawa, K.and Brinkman R. M. (1999) "Surface wave propagation in mangrove forests" ''Fluid Dynamics Research'' 24(4): pp. 219–249&lt;/ref&gt; Mangroves retard the tidal movement of water, allowing sediment to be deposited as the tide comes in, and leaving all except fine particles when the tide ebbs.&lt;ref&gt;Mazda, Yoshihiro et al. (1997) "Drag force due to vegetation in mangrove swamps" ''Mangroves and Salt Marshes'' 1: pp. 193–199&lt;/ref&gt; Mangroves therefore build their own environment.&lt;ref name="Mazda-2" /&gt;

The commercial and recreational fishing industries are prime beneficiaries of mangrove forests, which provide breeding and feeding grounds for fish and prawns.&lt;ref name=DAFF/&gt;  About 75% of the fish and prawns caught for commercial and recreational purposes in Queensland spend at least part of their lifecycles in mangroves.&lt;ref name=DAFF/&gt;

In some coastal communities, boardwalks and bird-viewing areas in mangrove forests provide attractions for the eco-tourism industry, for example, at [[Boondall Wetlands]].&lt;ref name=DAFF/&gt;

==Threats==

Threats to mangrove ecosystems include;
* coastal modifications such as reclaiming land (e.g. for building canal estates and marinas);&lt;ref name=Zann/&gt;
* erosion of shorelines in coastal lakes and estuaries;&lt;ref name=Zann/&gt;
* elevated levels of nutrients and sediments from land clearing, overgrazing and cropping;&lt;ref name=Zann/&gt;
* increased levels of heavy metals such as copper, lead, cadmium, zinc and mercury, and tributyl tin (TBT) from [[anti-fouling paint]]s;&lt;ref name=Zann/&gt;
* marine oil pollution from sewage systems and drains, which is estimated at 16,000 tonnes a year over the whole of Australia;&lt;ref name=Zann/&gt;
* accidental spills during re-fuelling of vessels in ports.&lt;ref name="Zann"&gt;{{cite book |last = Zann |first = Leon P. |url = http://www.environment.gov.au/archive/coasts/publications/somer/index.html | publisher=Australian Government, Dept of Environment, Water, Heritage, and the Arts |chapter = Marine Pollution |title = Our Sea, Our Future – Major findings of the State of the Marine Environment Report for Australia |accessdate = 23 January 2011 |id = ISBN |origyear = 1995 |isbn = 0-642-17391-5 |year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Removal of mangrove forests can lead to erosion of the shoreline, exposure of [[acid sulphate soils]], shallowing of estuaries and waterways, and a reduction in water quality.&lt;ref name = DIPE/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRETA"&gt;{{Cite web
 |title=Mangrove Management in the Northern Territory

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These threats can deplete the populations of fish, prawns, crabs and other sea life that use mangroves as breeding and feeding grounds, which would then impact on commercial and recreational fishing.&lt;ref name="Zann" /&gt;

==Protection and preservation==

About one third of the total area of mangrove forest in Australia is privately owned, including Indigenous reserves.&lt;ref name=DAFF/&gt; Approximately 18% of Australia’s mangrove forest areas fall under the protection of National Parks and other reserves.&lt;ref name=DAFF/&gt;

Mangroves are protected in Queensland under the Fisheries Act 1994, and in Western Australia under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950.

As the benefits of mangroves become more widely known, grassroots efforts to protect mangroves are becoming more common. Boardwalks provide opportunities for educating people about the ecological and economic importance of mangroves.&lt;ref name=DAFF/&gt;

[[File:AvalancheToe.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Glacier terminus|terminus]] of an avalanche in [[Alaska]]'s [[Kenai Fjords National Park|Kenai Fjords]].]]
[[File:Avalanche on Everest.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A powder snow avalanche in the [[Himalayas]] near [[Mount Everest]].]]

An '''avalanche''' (also called a '''snowslide''') is a cohesive slab of [[snow]] lying upon a weaker layer of snow in the snowpack that fractures and slides down a steep slope when triggered. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the [[snowpack]] ('''slab avalanche''') when the forces of the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradual widening ('''loose snow avalanche'''). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they [[Entrainment (physical geography)|entrain]] more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough, some of the snow may mix with the air forming a '''powder snow avalanche''', which is a type of [[gravity current]].

Slides of rocks or debris, behaving in a similar way to snow, are also referred to as avalanches (see [[rockslide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geology.campus.ad.csulb.edu/people/bperry/Mass%20Wasting/Flows.htm |title=Flows |publisher=Geology.campus.ad.csulb.edu |accessdate=2013-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818121756/http://geology.campus.ad.csulb.edu/people/bperry/Mass%20Wasting/Flows.htm |archivedate=2013-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The remainder of this article refers to snow avalanches.

The load on the snowpack may be only due to gravity, in which case failure may result either from weakening in the snowpack or increased load due to precipitation. Avalanches initiated by this process are known as spontaneous avalanches. Avalanches can also be triggered by other loading conditions such as human or biologically related activities. Seismic activity may also trigger the failure in the snowpack and avalanches.

Although primarily composed of flowing snow and air, large avalanches have the capability to entrain ice, rocks, trees, and other surficial material. However, they are distinct from [[slush flow| slushflows]] which have higher water content and more laminar flow, [[Mudflow|mudslides]] which have greater fluidity, [[Landslide#Debris landslide|rock slides]] which are often ice free, and [[serac]] collapses during an [[icefall]]. Avalanches are not rare or random events and are endemic to any mountain range that accumulates a standing snowpack. Avalanches are most common during winter or spring but glacier movements may cause ice and snow avalanches at any time of year. In mountainous terrain, avalanches are among the most serious objective [[natural hazard]]s to life and property, with their destructive capability resulting from their potential to carry enormous masses of snow at high speeds.

There is no universally accepted classification system for different forms of avalanches. Avalanches can be described by their size, their destructive potential, their initiation mechanism, their composition and their dynamics.

==Formation==

Most avalanches occur spontaneously during storms under increased load due to snowfall. The second largest cause of natural avalanches is metamorphic changes in the snowpack such as melting due to solar radiation. Other natural causes include rain, earthquakes, rockfall and icefall. Artificial triggers of avalanches include skiers, snowmobiles, and controlled explosive work. Contrary to popular belief, avalanches are not triggered by loud sound; the pressure from sound is orders of magnitude too small to trigger an avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Reuter|first=B.|last2=Schweizer|first2=J.|year=2009|title=Avalanche triggering by sound: Myth and truth|url=http://gblanc.fr/IMG/pdf/reuter2009.pdf|conference=ISSW 09 - International Snow Science Workshop, Proceedings|pages=330–333|quote=Based  on order of  magnitude  estimates  of the pressure amplitude of various sources that cause elastic or pressure (sound) waves it can be ruled out that shouting or loud noise can trigger snow slab avalanches. The amplitudes are at least about two orders of magnitude smaller than  known  efficient  triggers.  Triggering  by sound really is a myth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avalanche initiation can start at a point with only a small amount of snow moving initially; this is typical of wet snow avalanches or avalanches in dry unconsolidated snow. However, if the snow has sintered into a stiff slab overlying a weak layer then fractures can propagate very rapidly, so that a large volume of snow, that may be thousands of cubic meters, can start moving almost simultaneously.

A snowpack will fail when the load exceeds the strength. The load is straightforward; it is the weight of the snow. However, the strength of the snowpack is much more difficult to determine and is extremely heterogenous. It varies in detail with properties of the snow grains, size, density, morphology, temperature, water content; and the properties of the bonds between the grains.
&lt;ref name="McClung 2006"&gt;McClung, David and Shaerer, Peter: The Avalanche Handbook, The Mountaineers: 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-89886-809-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties may all metamorphose in time according to the local humidity, water vapour flux, temperature and heat flux. The top of the snowpack is also extensively influenced by incoming radiation and the local air flow. One of the aims of avalanche research is to develop and validate computer models that can describe the evolution of the seasonal snowpack over time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130128103159/http://www.mendeley.com/research/a-physical-snowpack-model-for-the-swiss-avalanche-warning-part-i-numerical-model/ SNOWPACK ]&lt;/ref&gt; A complicating factor is the complex interaction of terrain and weather, which causes significant spatial and temporal variability of the depths, crystal forms, and layering of the seasonal snowpack.

=== Slab avalanches ===
Slab avalanches form frequently in snow that has been deposited, or redeposited by wind. They have the characteristic appearance of a block (slab) of snow cut out from its surroundings by fractures. Elements of slab avalanches include the following: a crown fracture at the top of the start zone, flank fractures on the sides of the start zones, and a fracture at the bottom called the stauchwall. The crown and flank fractures are vertical walls in the snow delineating the snow that was entrained in the avalanche from the snow that remained on the slope. Slabs can vary in thickness from a few centimetres to three metres. Slab avalanches account for around 90% of avalanche-related fatalities in backcountry users.

=== Powder snow avalanches ===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
The largest avalanches form turbulent suspension currents known as [[powder snow avalanche]]s or mixed avalanches.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson JE. 1997. Gravity currents in the environment and the laboratory. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; These consist of a powder cloud, which overlies a dense avalanche. They can form from any type of snow or initiation mechanism, but usually occur with fresh dry powder.
They can exceed speeds of {{convert|300|kph}}, and masses of 10000000 tonnes; their flows can travel long distances along flat valley bottoms and even uphill for short distances.

=== Wet snow avalanches ===

In contrast to powder snow avalanches, wet snow avalanches are a low velocity suspension of snow and water, with the flow confined to the track surface (McClung, first edition 1999, page 108).&lt;ref name="McClung 2006"/&gt; The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the track and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~10–40&amp;nbsp;km/h), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass and density. The body of the flow of a wet snow avalanche can plough through soft snow, and can scour boulders, earth, trees, and other vegetation; leaving exposed and often scored ground in the avalanche track. Wet snow avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snow packs that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water. The isothermal characteristic of wet snow avalanches has led to the secondary term of isothermal slides found in the literature (for example in Daffern, 1999, page 93).&lt;ref name="Daffern 1999"&gt;Daffern, Tony: Avalanche Safety for Skiers, Climbers and Snowboarders, Rocky Mountain Books: 1999. {{ISBN|0-921102-72-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; At temperate latitudes wet snow avalanches are frequently associated with climatic avalanche cycles at the end of the winter season, when there is significant daytime warming.

=== Avalanche pathway ===
As an avalanche moves down a slope it follows a certain pathway that is dependent on the slope's degree of steepness and the volume of snow/ice involved in the [[Mass wasting|mass movement]]. The origin of an avalanche is called the Starting Point and typically occurs on a 30–45 degree slope. The body of the pathway is called the Track of the avalanche and usually occurs on a 20–30 degree slope. When the avalanche loses its momentum and eventually stops it reaches the Runout Zone. This usually occurs when the slope has reached a steepness that is less than 20 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Disasters|last=Abbott|first=Patrick|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2016|isbn=0078022983|location=New York, NY|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These degrees are not consistently true due to the fact that each avalanche is unique depending on the stability of the [[snowpack]] that it was derived from as well as the environmental or human influences that triggered the mass movement.

=== Ice avalanche ===
An ice avalanche occurs when a large piece of ice, such as from a serac or calving glacier, falls onto ice (such as the Khumbu Icefall), triggering a movement of broken ice chunks. The resulting movement is more analogous to a rockfall or a landslide than a snow avalanche.&lt;ref name="McClung 2006" /&gt; They are typically very difficult to predict and almost impossible to mitigate. 

==Terrain, snowpack, weather==
Doug Fesler and Jill Fredston developed a conceptual model of the three primary elements of avalanches: terrain, weather, and snowpack. Terrain describes the places where avalanches occur, weather describes the meteorological conditions that create the snowpack, and snowpack describes the structural characteristics of snow that make avalanche formation possible.&lt;ref name="McClung 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fesler, Doug and Fredston, Jill: Snow Sense, Alaska Mountain Safety Center, Inc. 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-615-49935-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrain===
[[File:North Ridge of Mount Rohr.jpg|thumb|250px|In steep avalanche-prone terrain, traveling on [[ridge]]s is generally safer than traversing the slopes.]]

Avalanche formation requires a slope shallow enough for snow to accumulate but steep enough for the snow to accelerate once set in motion by the combination of mechanical failure (of the snowpack) and gravity. The angle of the slope that can hold snow, called the [[angle of repose]], depends on a variety of factors such as crystal form and moisture content. Some forms of drier and colder snow will only stick to shallower slopes, while wet and warm snow can bond to very steep surfaces. In particular, in coastal mountains, such as the [[Cordillera del Paine]] region of [[Patagonia]], deep snowpacks collect on vertical and even overhanging rock faces. The slope angle that can allow moving snow to accelerate depends on a variety of factors such as the snow's shear strength (which is itself dependent upon crystal form) and the configuration of layers and inter-layer interfaces.

[[File:Avalanche path 7271.JPG|thumb|left|Avalanche path with {{convert|800|m|ft}} vertical fall in the [[Glacier Peak Wilderness]], [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]. Avalanche paths in alpine terrain may be poorly defined because of limited vegetation. Below tree line, avalanche paths are often delineated by vegetative trim lines created by past avalanches. The start zone is visible near the top of the image, the track is in the middle of the image and clearly denoted by vegetative trimlines, and the runout zone is shown at the bottom of the image. One possible timeline is as follows: an avalanche forms in the start zone near the ridge, and then descends the track, until coming to rest in the runout zone.]]
[[File:Mount Windsor Cornice2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[cornice (climbing)|cornice]] of snow about to fall. Cracks in the snow are visible in area (1). Area (3) fell soon after this picture was taken, leaving area (2) as the new edge.]]

The snowpack on slopes with sunny exposures is strongly influenced by [[Sunlight|sunshine]]. Diurnal cycles of thawing and refreezing can stabilize the snowpack by promoting settlement. Strong freeze-thaw cycles result in the formation of surface crusts during the night and of unstable surface snow during the day. Slopes in the lee of a ridge or of another wind obstacle accumulate more snow and are more likely to include pockets of deep snow, [[wind slabs]], and [[cornice (climbing)|cornices]], all of which, when disturbed, may result in avalanche formation. Conversely, the snowpack on a windward slope is often much shallower than on a lee slope.

Avalanches and avalanche paths share common elements: a start zone where the avalanche originates, a track along which the avalanche flows, and a runout zone where the avalanche comes to rest. The debris deposit is the accumulated mass of the avalanched snow once it has come to rest in the runout zone. For the image at left, many small avalanches form in this avalanche path every year, but most of these avalanches do not run the full vertical or horizontal length of the path. The frequency with which avalanches form in a given area is known as the [[return period]].

The start zone of an avalanche must be steep enough to allow snow to accelerate once set in motion, additionally [[Convex function|convex]] slopes are less stable than [[concave function|concave]] slopes, because of the disparity between the [[tensile strength]] of snow layers and their [[compressive strength]]. The composition and structure of the ground surface beneath the snowpack influences the stability of the snowpack, either being a source of strength or weakness. Avalanches are unlikely to form in very thick forests, but boulders and sparsely distributed vegetation can create weak areas deep within the snowpack through the formation of strong temperature gradients. Full-depth avalanches (avalanches that sweep a slope virtually clean of snow cover) are more common on slopes with smooth ground, such as grass or rock slabs.

Generally speaking, avalanches follow drainages down-slope, frequently sharing drainage features with summertime watersheds. At and below [[tree line]], avalanche paths through drainages are well defined by vegetation boundaries called [[trim line]]s, which occur where avalanches have removed trees and prevented regrowth of large vegetation. Engineered drainages, such as the [[avalanche dam]] on [[Mount Stephen]] in [[Kicking Horse Pass]], have been constructed to protect people and property by redirecting the flow of avalanches. Deep debris deposits from avalanches will collect in catchments at the terminus of a run out, such as gullies and river beds.

Slopes flatter than 25&amp;nbsp;degrees or steeper than 60&amp;nbsp;degrees typically have a lower incidence of avalanches. Human-triggered avalanches have the greatest incidence when the snow's [[angle of repose]] is between 35 and 45&amp;nbsp;degrees; the critical angle, the angle at which human-triggered avalanches are most frequent, is 38&amp;nbsp;degrees. When the incidence of human triggered avalanches is normalized by the rates of recreational use, however, hazard increases uniformly with slope angle, and no significant difference in hazard for a given exposure direction can be found.&lt;ref name="Pascal Hageli et al"&gt;[http://www.avisualanche.ca/publications.html Pascal Hageli et al.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule of thumb is: ''A slope that is flat enough to hold snow but steep enough to ski has the potential to generate an avalanche, regardless of the angle.''

===Snowpack structure and characteristics===
[[File:D Hoarfrost 3.jpg|thumb|After surface [[hoarfrost]] becomes buried by later snowfall, the buried hoar layer can be a weak layer upon which upper layers can slide.]]

The snowpack is composed of ground-parallel layers that accumulate over the winter. Each layer contains ice grains that are representative of the distinct meteorological conditions during which the snow formed and was deposited. Once deposited, a snow layer continues to evolve under the influence of the meteorological conditions that prevail after deposition.

For an avalanche to occur, it is necessary that a snowpack have a weak layer (or instability) below a slab of cohesive snow. In practice the formal mechanical and structural factors related to snowpack instability are not directly observable outside of laboratories, thus the more easily observed properties of the snow layers (e.g. penetration resistance, grain size, grain type, temperature) are used as index measurements of the mechanical properties of the snow (e.g. [[tensile strength]], [[friction]] coefficients, [[shear strength]], and [[Ductility|ductile strength]]). This results in two principal sources of uncertainty in determining snowpack stability based on snow structure: First, both the factors influencing snow stability and the specific characteristics of the snowpack vary widely within small areas and time scales, resulting in significant difficulty extrapolating point observations of snow layers across different scales of space and time. Second, the relationship between readily observable snowpack characteristics and the snowpack's critical mechanical properties has not been completely developed.

While the deterministic relationship between snowpack characteristics and snowpack stability is still a matter of ongoing scientific study, there is a growing empirical understanding of the snow composition and deposition characteristics that influence the likelihood of an avalanche. Observation and experience has shown that newly fallen snow requires time to bond with the snow layers beneath it, especially if the new snow falls during very cold and dry conditions. If ambient air temperatures are cold enough, shallow snow above or around boulders, plants, and other discontinuities in the slope, weakens from rapid crystal growth that occurs in the presence of a critical temperature gradient. Large, angular snow crystals are indicators of weak snow, because such crystals have fewer bonds per unit volume than small, rounded crystals that pack tightly together. Consolidated snow is less likely to slough than loose powdery layers or wet isothermal snow; however, consolidated snow is a necessary condition for the occurrence of [[slab avalanche]]s, and persistent instabilities within the snowpack can hide below well-consolidated surface layers. Uncertainty associated with the empirical understanding of the factors influencing snow stability leads most professional avalanche workers to recommend conservative use of avalanche terrain relative to current snowpack instability.

===Weather===
[[File:Avalanche testing snow pit.JPG|thumb|left|250px|After digging a snow pit, it is possible to evaluate the snowpack for unstable layers. In this picture, snow from a weak layer has been easily scraped away by hand, leaving a horizontal line in the wall of the pit.]]

Avalanches can only occur in a standing snowpack. Typically winter seasons at high latitudes, high altitudes, or both have weather that is sufficiently unsettled and cold enough for precipitated snow to accumulate into a seasonal snowpack. [[Continentality]], through its potentiating influence on the meteorological extremes experienced by snowpacks, is an important factor in the evolution of instabilities, and consequential occurrence of avalanches. Conversely, proximity to [[Oceanic climate|coastal environments]] moderates the meteorological extremes experienced by snowpacks, and results in a faster stabilization of the snowpack after storm cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Whiteman, Charles David: Mountain Meteorology: Fundamentals and Applications, Oxford University Press: 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-513271-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of the snowpack is critically sensitive to small variations within the narrow range of meteorological conditions that allow for the accumulation of snow into a snowpack. Among the critical factors controlling snowpack evolution are: heating by the sun, [[radiational cooling]], vertical [[temperature gradient]]s in standing snow, snowfall amounts, and snow types. Generally, mild winter weather will promote the settlement and stabilization of the snowpack; conversely, very cold, windy, or hot weather will weaken the snowpack.

At temperatures close to the freezing point of water, or during times of moderate solar radiation, a gentle freeze-thaw cycle will take place. The melting and refreezing of water in the snow strengthens the snowpack during the freezing phase and weakens it during the thawing phase. A rapid rise in temperature, to a point significantly above the freezing point of water, may cause avalanche formation at any time of year.

Persistent cold temperatures can either prevent new snow from stabilizing or destabilize the existing snowpack. Cold air temperatures on the snow surface produce a temperature gradient in the snow, because the ground temperature at the base of the snowpack is usually around °C,{{clarify|figure missing|date=November 2017}} and the ambient air temperature can be much colder. When a temperature gradient greater than 10&amp;nbsp;°C change per vertical meter of snow is sustained for more than a day, angular crystals called [[depth hoar]] or facets begin forming in the snowpack because of rapid moisture transport along the temperature gradient. These angular crystals, which bond poorly to one another and the surrounding snow, often become a persistent weakness in the snowpack. When a slab lying on top of a persistent weakness is loaded by a force greater than the strength of the slab and persistent weak layer, the persistent weak layer can fail and generate an avalanche.

Any wind stronger than a light breeze can contribute to a rapid accumulation of snow on sheltered slopes downwind. Wind slab forms quickly and, if present, weaker snow below the slab may not have time to adjust to the new load. Even on a clear day, wind can quickly load a slope with snow by blowing snow from one place to another. Top-loading occurs when wind deposits snow from the top of a slope; cross-loading occurs when wind deposits snow parallel to the slope. When a wind blows over the top of a mountain, the leeward, or downwind, side of the mountain experiences top-loading, from the top to the bottom of that lee slope. When the wind blows across a ridge that leads up the mountain, the leeward side of the ridge is subject to cross-loading. Cross-loaded wind-slabs are usually difficult to identify visually.

Snowstorms and rainstorms are important contributors to avalanche danger. Heavy snowfall will cause instability in the existing snowpack, both because of the additional weight and because the new snow has insufficient time to bond to underlying snow layers. Rain has a similar effect. In the short-term, rain causes instability because, like a heavy snowfall, it imposes an additional load on the snowpack; and, once rainwater seeps down through the snow, it acts as a lubricant, reducing the natural friction between snow layers that holds the snowpack together. Most avalanches happen during or soon after a storm.

Daytime exposure to sunlight will rapidly destabilize the upper layers of the snowpack if the sunlight is strong enough to melt the snow, thereby reducing its hardness. During clear nights, the snowpack can re-freeze when ambient air temperatures fall below freezing, through the process of long-wave radiative cooling, or both. Radiative heat loss occurs when the night air is significantly cooler than the snowpack, and the heat stored in the snow is re-radiated into the atmosphere.

==Dynamics==
When a slab avalanche forms, the slab disintegrates into increasingly smaller fragments as the snow travels downhill. If the fragments become small enough the outer layer of the avalanche, called a saltation layer, takes on the characteristics of a [[fluid]]. When sufficiently fine particles are present they can become airborne and, given a sufficient quantity of airborne snow, this portion of the avalanche can become separated from the bulk of the avalanche and travel a greater distance as a powder snow avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/satsie/docs/final_report.pdf SATSIE Final Report (large PDF file – 33.1 Mb)], page 94, October 1, 2005 to May 31, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific studies using [[radar]], following the 1999 [[Galtür Avalanche|Galtür avalanche disaster]], confirmed the hypothesis that a [[Saltation (geology)|saltation layer]] forms between the surface and the airborne components of an avalanche, which can also separate from the bulk of the avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/1999/avalanche_script.shtml Horizon: Anatomy of an Avalanche], ''[[BBC]]', 1999-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Driving an avalanche is the component of the avalanche's weight parallel to the slope; as the avalanche progresses any unstable snow in its path will tend to become incorporated, so increasing the overall weight. This force will increase as the steepness of the slope increases, and diminish as the slope flattens. Resisting this are a number of components that are thought to interact with each other: the friction between the avalanche and the surface beneath; friction between the air and snow within the fluid; fluid-dynamic drag at the leading edge of the avalanche; shear resistance between the avalanche and the air through which it is passing, and shear resistance between the fragments within the avalanche itself. An avalanche will continue to accelerate until the resistance exceeds the forward force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avalanche.org/~moonstone/zoning/avalanche%20dynamics.htm Avalanche Dynamics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224071418/http://www.avalanche.org/~moonstone/zoning/avalanche%20dynamics.htm |date=2009-02-24 }}, Art Mears, 2002-07-11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modeling===
Attempts to model avalanche behaviour date from the early 20th century, notably the work of Professor Lagotala in preparation for the [[1924 Winter Olympics]] in [[Chamonix]].&lt;ref name=Ancey&gt;[http://lhe.epfl.ch/pdf/snow-avalanche.pdf Snow Avalanches], Christophe Ancey&lt;/ref&gt; His method was developed by A. Voellmy and popularised following the publication in 1955 of his ''Ueber die Zerstoerungskraft von Lawinen'' (On the Destructive Force of Avalanches).&lt;ref&gt;VOELLMY, A., 1955. ''Ober die Zerstorunskraft von Lawinen''. Schweizerische Bauzetung (English: ''On the Destructive Force of Avalanches''. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service).&lt;/ref&gt;

Voellmy used a simple empirical formula, treating an avalanche as a sliding block of snow moving with a drag force that was proportional to the square of the speed of its flow:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risknat.org/pages/programme_dep/docs/cemagref_etna/2002_Berthet-Rambaud.pdf Quantification de la sollicitation avalancheuse par analyse en retour du comportement de structures métalliques], page 14, ''Pôle Grenoblois d’études et de recherche pour la Prévention des risques naturels'', October 2003, in French&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \textrm{Pref} = \frac {1} {2} \, { \rho} \, { v^2} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

He and others subsequently derived other formulae that take other factors into account, with the Voellmy-Salm-Gubler and the Perla-Cheng-McClung models becoming most widely used as simple tools to model flowing (as opposed to powder snow) avalanches.&lt;ref name=Ancey/&gt;

Since the 1990s many more sophisticated models have been developed. In Europe much of the recent work was carried out as part of the SATSIE (Avalanche Studies and Model Validation in Europe) research project supported by the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/satsie/ SATSIE – Avalanche Studies and Model Validation in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; which produced the leading-edge MN2L model, now in use with the ''Service Restauration des Terrains en Montagne'' (Mountain Rescue Service) in
France, and D2FRAM (Dynamical Two-Flow-Regime Avalanche Model), which was still undergoing validation as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/satsie/docs/final_report.pdf SATSIE Final Report (large PDF file – 33.1 Mb)], October 1, 2005 to May 31, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Other known models are the SAMOS-AT avalanche simulation software&lt;ref&gt;[http://arc.lib.montana.edu/snow-science/objects/issw-2009-0519-0523.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and the RAMMS software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturfare.no/_attachment/534838/binary/859980]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention===
{{main|Avalanche control}}
Preventative measures are employed in areas where avalanches pose a significant threat to people, such as [[ski resort]]s, mountain towns, roads, and railways. There are several ways to prevent avalanches and lessen their power and deve preventative measures reduce the likelihood and size of avalanches by disrupting the structure of the snowpack, while passive measures reinforce and stabilize the snowpack ''in situ''. The simplest active measure is repeatedly traveling on a snowpack as snow accumulates; this can be by means of boot-packing, ski-cutting, or [[Snow grooming|machine grooming]]. [[Explosive]]s are used extensively to prevent avalanches, by triggering smaller avalanches that break down instabilities in the snowpack, and removing overburden that can result in larger avalanches. Explosive charges are delivered by a number of methods including hand-tossed charges, helicopter-dropped bombs, Gazex concussion lines, and ballistic projectiles launched by air cannons and artillery. Passive preventive systems such as [[snow fence]]s and light walls can be used to direct the placement of snow. Snow builds up around the fence, especially the side that faces the prevailing [[wind]]s. Downwind of the fence, snow buildup is lessened. This is caused by the loss of snow at the fence that would have been deposited and the pickup of the snow that is already there by the wind, which was depleted of snow at the fence. When there is a sufficient density of [[tree]]s, they can greatly reduce the strength of avalanches. They hold snow in place and when there is an avalanche, the impact of the snow against the trees slows it down. Trees can either be planted or they can be conserved, such as in the building of a ski resort, to reduce the strength of avalanches.

In turn, socio-environmental changes can influence the occurrence of damaging avalanches: some studies linking changes in land-use/land-cover patterns and the evolution of snow avalanche damage in mid latitude mountains show the importance of the role played by vegetation cover, that is at the root of the increase of damage  when the protective forest is deforested (because of demographic growth, intensive grazing and industrial or legal causes), and at the root of the decrease of damage because of the transformation of a traditional land-management system based on overexploitation into a system based on land marginalization and reforestation, something that has happened mainly since the mid-20th century in mountain environments of developed countries&lt;ref name="García-Hernández et al., 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last=García-Hernández |first=C |title=Reforestation and land use change as drivers for a decrease of avalanche damage in mid-latitude mountains (NW Spain). Global and Planetary Change, 153:35–50|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316750923_Reforestation_and_land_use_change_as_drivers_for_a_decrease_of_avalanche_damage_in_mid-latitude_mountains_NW_Spain|publisher=Elsevier |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitigation===

In many areas, regular avalanche tracks can be identified and precautions can be taken to minimise damage, such as the prevention of development in these areas. To mitigate the effect of avalanches the construction of artificial barriers can be very effective in reducing avalanche damage. There are several types: One kind of barrier ([[snow net]]) uses a net strung between poles that are anchored by [[guy wire]]s in addition to their foundations. These barriers are similar to those used for [[rockslide]]s. Another type of barrier is a rigid fence-like structure ([[snow fence]]) and may be constructed of [[steel]], [[wood]] or pre-stressed [[concrete]]. They usually have gaps between the beams and are built perpendicular to the slope, with reinforcing beams on the downhill side. Rigid barriers are often considered unsightly, especially when many rows must be built. They are also expensive and vulnerable to damage from falling rocks in the warmer months. In addition to industrially manufactured barriers, landscaped barriers, called [[avalanche dam]]s stop or deflect avalanches with their weight and strength. These barriers are made out of concrete, rocks or earth. They are usually placed right above the structure, road or railway that they are trying to protect, although they can also be used to channel avalanches into other barriers. Occasionally, [[earth mound]]s are placed in the avalanche's path to slow it down. Finally, along transportation corridors, large shelters, called [[snow shed]]s, can be built directly in the slide path of an avalanche to protect traffic from avalanches.

===Early warning systems===
Warning systems can detect avalanches which develop slowly, such as ice avalanches caused by icefalls from glaciers. Interferometric Radars, high-resolution Cameras, or motion sensors can monitor instable areas over a long term, lasting from days to years. Experts interpret the recorded data and are able to recognize upcoming ruptures in order to initiate appropriate measures. Such systems (e.g. the monitoring of the Weissmies glacier in Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geopraevent.ch/project/weissmies-glacier-velocities/?lang=en|title=Glacier monitoring Weissmies|accessdate=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can recognize events several days in advance.

===Alarm systems===
[[file:ZermattRadar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Radar station for avalanche monitoring in [[Zermatt]].&lt;ref name="Zermatt" /&gt;]]

Modern radar technology enables the monitoring of large areas and the localization of avalanches at any weather condition, by day and by night. Complex alarm systems are able to detect avalanches within a short time in order to close (e.g. roads and rails) or evacuate (e.g. construction sites) endangered areas. An example of such a system is installed on the only access road of Zermatt in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Zermatt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geopraevent.ch/project/avalanche-radar-zermatt/?lang=en|title=Avalanche Radar Zermatt|accessdate=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two radars monitor the slope of a mountain above the road. The system automatically closes the road by activating several barriers and traffic lights within seconds such that no persons are harmed.

===Survival, rescue, and recovery===

Avalanche accidents are broadly differentiated into 2 categories: accidents in recreational settings, and accidents in residential, industrial, and transportation settings. This distinction is motivated by the observed difference in the causes of avalanche accidents in the two settings. In the recreational setting most accidents are caused by the people involved in the avalanche. In a 1996 study, Jamieson et al. (pages 7–20)&lt;ref name="Jamieson 1996"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jamieson |first=Bruce |title=Avalanche Accidents in Canada Volume 4: 1984–1996 |url=http://avalancheinfo.net/Newsletters%20and%20Articles/Articles/AvalancheAccidentsV4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125095134/http://avalancheinfo.net/Newsletters%20and%20Articles/Articles/AvalancheAccidentsV4.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 January 2011 |publisher=Canadian Avalanche Association |accessdate=7 March 2013 |author2=Torsten Geldstzer }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 83% of all avalanches in the recreational setting were caused by those who were involved in the accident. In contrast, all of the accidents in the residential, industrial, and transportation settings were due to spontaneous natural avalanches. Because of the difference in the causes of avalanche accidents, and the activities pursued in the two settings, avalanche and disaster management professionals have developed two related preparedness, rescue, and recovery strategies for each of the settings.

==Notable avalanches==
{{see also|List of avalanches}}
Two avalanches occurred in March 1910 in the Cascade and Selkirk Mountain ranges; On March 1 the [[Wellington avalanche]] killed 96 in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]], United States. Three days later 62 railroad workers were killed in the [[Rogers Pass avalanche]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada.

During [[World War I]], an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 soldiers died as a result of avalanches during the mountain campaign in the [[Alps]] at the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Austrian-Italian]] front, many of which were caused by [[artillery]] fire.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Davis (2008).

In the [[northern hemisphere]] winter of 1950–1951 approximately 649 avalanches were recorded in a three-month period throughout the [[Alps]] in Austria, France, Switzerland, Italy and Germany. This series of avalanches killed around 265 people and was termed the [[Winter of Terror (1951)|Winter of Terror]].

A mountain climbing camp on Lenin Peak, in what is now Kyrgyzstan, was wiped out in 1990 when an earthquake triggered a large avalanche that overran the camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/18/world/avalanche-kills-40-climbers-in-soviet-central-asia.html | work=The New York Times | first=Francis X. | last=Clines | title=Avalanche Kills 40 Climbers in Soviet Central Asia | date=July 18, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-three climbers were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centralasia-travel.com/en/expeditions/lenin/history/ |title=Lenin Peak.

In 1993, the [[1993 Bayburt Üzengili avalanche|Bayburt Üzengili avalanche]] killed 60 individuals in Üzengili in the province of [[Bayburt]], [[Turkey]].

A large avalanche in [[Montroc, France]], in 1999, 300,000&amp;nbsp;cubic metres of snow slid on a 30° slope, achieving a speed in the region of  {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. It killed 12 people in their chalets under 100,000&amp;nbsp;tons of snow, {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. The mayor of [[Chamonix]] was convicted of second-degree murder for not evacuating the area, but received a suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pistehors.com/backcountry/wiki/Articles/Montroc-Avalanche PisteHors.com: Montroc Avalanche]&lt;/ref&gt;

The small Austrian village of [[Galtür]] was hit by the [[Galtür Avalanche|Galtür avalanche]] in 1999. The village was thought to be in a safe zone but the avalanche was exceptionally large and flowed into the village. Thirty-one people died.

On December 1, 2000, the Glory Bowl Avalanche formed on Mt. Glory which is located within the [[Teton Range|Teton Mountain Range]] in Wyoming, United States. Joel Roof was snowboarding recreationally in this backcountry, bowl-shaped run and triggered the avalanche. He was carried nearly 2,000 feet to the base of the mountain and was not successfully rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meted.ucar.edu/afwa/avalanche/navmenu.php|title=Avalanche Weather Forecasting|author=COMET Program|date=2010|website=meted.ucar.edu/afwa/avalanche/index.htm|publisher=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

===European avalanche risk table===
In [[Europe]], the avalanche risk is widely rated on the following scale, which was adopted in April 1993 to replace the earlier non-standard national schemes. Descriptions were last updated in May 2003 to enhance uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slf.ch/laworg/muenchen2003-fr.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050417204931/http://www.slf.ch/laworg/muenchen2003-fr.pdf|date=April 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, most avalanche deaths occur at risk levels 3 and 4. In Switzerland most occur at levels 2 and 3. It is thought that this may be due to national differences of interpretation when assessing the risks.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://skirando.com/images/avalanche/avalanche-accidents-2006.pdf An Analysis of French Avalanche Accidents for 2005–2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908031710/http://skirando.com/images/avalanche/avalanche-accidents-2006.pdf |date=2008-09-08 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American Avalanche Danger Scale===
[[File:Danger Scale - English.jpg|thumb|right|Danger Scale – English]]

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the following avalanche danger scale is used. Descriptors vary depending on country.

===Canadian classification for avalanche size===
The Canadian classification for avalanche size is based upon the consequences of the avalanche. Half sizes are commonly used.&lt;ref name = "backcountryavalancheawareness" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! style="width:5%;"|Size
! style="width:95%;"|Destructive Potential
|-
|1
|Relatively harmless to people.
|-
|2
|Could bury, injure or kill a person.
|-
|3
|Could bury and destroy a car, damage a truck, destroy a small building or break a few trees.
|-
|4
|Could destroy a railway car, large truck, several buildings or a forest area up to 4&amp;nbsp;hectares.
|-
|5
|Largest snow avalanche known. Could destroy a village or a forest of 40&amp;nbsp;hectares.
|}

===Rutschblock Test===
Slab avalanche hazard analysis can be done using the Rutschblock Test. A 2&amp;nbsp;m wide block of snow is isolated from the rest of the slope and progressively loaded. The result is a rating of slope stability on a seven step scale.&lt;ref name="Abromelt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsavalanche.org/Default.aspx?ContentId=23&amp;LinkId=28&amp;ParentLinkId=3 |title=Learn how to: Perform A Rutschblock Test |author=Doug Abromelt and Greg Johnson |date=Winter 2011–2012 |work= |publisher=USFS National Avalanche Center |accessdate=2012-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901034917/http://fsavalanche.org/Default.aspx?ContentId=23&amp;LinkId=28&amp;ParentLinkId=3 |archivedate=2013-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Axis powers''' ({{lang-de|Achsenmächte}}; {{lang-it|Potenze dell'Asse}}; {{lang-ja|枢軸国}} ''Sūjikukoku''), also known as the '''Rome–Berlin–Tokyo Axis''', were the nations that fought in [[World War II]] against the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The Axis powers agreed on their opposition to the Allies, but did not completely coordinate their activity.

The Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Germany, Italy, and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. The first step was the treaty signed by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in October 1936. [[Benito Mussolini]] declared on 1 November that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome–Berlin axis, thus creating the term "Axis".&lt;ref name="Schmitz"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cornelia Schmitz-Berning |title=Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |page=745 |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-11-019549-1 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 March 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobSec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/axis.htm |title=Axis |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=26 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The almost simultaneous second step was the signing in November 1936 of the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], an anti-communist treaty between Germany and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Italy joined the Pact in 1937. The "Rome–Berlin Axis" became a [[Collective defense|military alliance]] in 1939 under the so-called "[[Pact of Steel]]", with the [[Tripartite Pact]] of 1940 leading to the integration of the military aims of Germany, Italy and Japan.

At its zenith during World War II, the Axis presided over territories that occupied large parts of [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and [[East Asia]]. There were no three-way summit meetings and cooperation and coordination was minimal, with slightly more between Germany and Italy. The war ended in 1945 with the defeat of the Axis powers and the dissolution of their alliance. As in the case of the Allies, membership of the Axis was fluid, with some nations switching sides or changing their degree of military involvement over the course of the war.

==Origins and creation==
{{Fascism sidebar}}
{{Main|Tripartite Pact}}
The term "axis" was first applied to the Italo-German relationship by the Italian prime minister [[Benito Mussolini]] in September 1923, when he wrote in the preface to Roberto Suster's ''Germania Repubblica'' that "there is no doubt that in this moment the axis of European history passes through Berlin" (''non v'ha dubbio che in questo momento l'asse della storia europea passa per Berlino'').&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Dietrich Glessgen and Günter Holtus, eds., ''Genesi e dimensioni di un vocabolario etimologico'', Lessico Etimologico Italiano: Etymologie und Wortgeschichte des Italienischen (Ludwig Reichert, 1992), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he was seeking an alliance with the [[Weimar Republic]] against [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] in the dispute over the [[Free State of Fiume]].&lt;ref name=Watt&gt;D. C. Watt, "The Rome–Berlin Axis, 1936–1940: Myth and Reality", ''The Review of Politics'', 22: 4 (1960), pp. 530–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]]'s prime minister [[Gyula Gömbös]] when advocating an alliance of Hungary with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in the early 1930s.{{sfn|Sinor|1959|p=291}} Gömbös' efforts did affect the Italo-Hungarian [[Rome Protocols]], but his sudden death in 1936 while negotiating with Germany in [[Munich]] and the arrival of [[Kálmán Darányi]], his successor, ended Hungary's involvement in pursuing a trilateral axis.{{sfn|Sinor|1959|p=291}} Contentious negotiations between the Italian foreign minister, [[Galeazzo Ciano]], and the German ambassador, [[Ulrich von Hassell]], resulted in a [[Nineteen-Point Protocol]], signed by Ciano and his German counterpart, [[Konstantin von Neurath]], in 1936. When Mussolini publicly announced the signing on 1 November, he proclaimed the creation of a Rome–Berlin axis.&lt;ref name=Watt/&gt;

===Initial proposals of a German–Italian alliance===
Italy under ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] had pursued a strategic alliance of Italy with Germany against France since the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124"&gt;MacGregor Knox. Common Destiny: Dictatorship, Foreign Policy, and War in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Cambridge University Press, 2000. Pp. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to becoming head of government in Italy as leader of the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] movement, Mussolini had advocated alliance with defeated Germany after the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 settled World War I.&lt;ref name="MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124"/&gt; He believed that Italy could expand its influence in Europe by allying with Germany against France.&lt;ref name="MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124"/&gt; In early 1923, as a goodwill gesture to Germany, Italy secretly delivered weapons for the German Army, which had faced major disarmament under the provisions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="MacGregor Knox 2000.

In September 1923, Mussolini offered German Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]] a "common policy": he sought German military support against potential French military intervention over Italy's diplomatic dispute with Yugoslavia over [[Free State of Fiume|Fiume]], should an Italian seizure of Fiume result in war between Italy and Yugoslavia. The German ambassador to Italy in 1924 reported that Mussolini saw a nationalist Germany as an essential ally for Italy against France, and hoped to tap into the desire within the German army and the German political right for a war of revenge against France.&lt;ref name="MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124"/&gt;

During the Weimar Republic, the German government did not respect the Treaty of Versailles that it had been pressured to sign, and various government figures at the time rejected Germany's post-Versailles borders. General [[Hans von Seeckt]] (head of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' command from 1920 to 1926) supported an alliance between Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] to invade and partition Poland between them and restore the German-Russian border of 1914.&lt;ref name="Christian Leitz p10"&gt;Christian Leitz. Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933–1941: The Road to Global War. p10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Streseman]] as German foreign minister in 1925 declared that the reincorporation of territories lost to [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] in the Treaty of Versailles was a major task of German foreign policy.&lt;ref name="Christian Leitz p10"/&gt; The ''Reichswehr'' Ministry memorandum of 1926 declared its intention to seek the reincorporation of German territory lost to Poland as its first priority, to be followed by the return of the Saar territory, the annexation of Austria, and remilitarization of the Rhineland.&lt;ref name="Christian Leitz p10"/&gt;

Since the 1920s Italy had identified the year 1935 as a crucial date for preparing for a war against France, as 1935 was the year when Germany's obligations under the Treaty of Versailles were scheduled to expire.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor Knox. Common Destiny: Dictatorship, Foreign Policy, and War in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Cambridge University Press, 2000. Pp. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meetings took place in Berlin in 1924 between Italian General [[Luigi Capello]] and prominent figures in the German military, such as von Seeckt and [[Erich Ludendorff]], over military collaboration between Germany and Italy. The discussions concluded that Germans still wanted a war of revenge against France but were short on weapons and hoped that Italy could assist Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John Gooch. ''Mussolini and His Generals: The Armed Forces and Fascist Foreign Policy, 1922–1940''. Cambridge University Press, 2007. P11.&lt;/ref&gt;

However at this time Mussolini stressed one important condition that Italy must pursue in an alliance with Germany: that Italy "must&amp;nbsp;... tow them, not be towed by them".&lt;ref name="MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124"/&gt; Italian foreign minister [[Dino Grandi]] in the early 1930s stressed the importance of "decisive weight", involving Italy's relations between France and Germany, in which he recognized that Italy was not yet a major power, but perceived that Italy did have strong enough influence to alter the political situation in Europe by placing the weight of its support onto one side or another.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Schreiber, Bern Stegemann, Detlef Vogel. ''Germany and the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 1995. Pp. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; However Grandi stressed that Italy must seek to avoid becoming a "slave of the rule of three" in order to pursue its interests, arguing that although substantial Italo-French tensions existed, Italy would not unconditionally commit itself to an alliance with Germany, just as it would neither unconditionally commit itself to an alliance with France over conceivable Italo-German tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Schreiber, Bern Stegemann, Detlef Vogel. ''Germany and the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 1995. P. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Grandi's attempts to maintain a diplomatic balance between France and Germany were challenged in 1932 by pressure from the French, who had begun to prepare an alliance with Britain and the United States against the threat of a revanchist Germany.&lt;ref name="burgwyn"&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The French government warned Italy that it had to choose whether to be on the side of the pro-Versailles powers or that of the anti-Versailles revanchists.&lt;ref name="burgwyn"/&gt; Grandi responded that Italy would be willing to offer France support against Germany if France gave Italy its mandate over Cameroon and allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="burgwyn"/&gt; France refused Italy's proposed exchange for support, as it believed Italy's demands were unacceptable and the threat from Germany was not yet immediate.&lt;ref name="burgwyn"/&gt;

On 23 October 1932, Mussolini declared support for a Four Power Directorate that included Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, to bring about an orderly treaty revision outside of what he considered the outmoded [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name="burgwyn"/&gt; The proposed Directorate was pragmatically designed to reduce French hegemony in continental Europe, in order to reduce tensions between the great powers in the short term to buy Italy relief from being pressured into a specific war alliance while at the same time allowing them to benefit from diplomatic deals on treaty revisions.&lt;ref name="burgwyn"/&gt;

===Danube alliance, dispute over Austria===
[[File:Gombos Gyula.png|thumb|upright|[[Gyula Gömbös]], ''Prime Minister of Hungary'', 1932–1936]]

In 1932, Gyula Gömbös and the [[Party of Hungarian Life|Party of National Unity]] rose to power in Hungary, and immediately sought an alliance with Italy.&lt;ref name="burgwyn"/&gt; Gömbös sought to alter Hungary's post–[[Treaty of Trianon]] borders, but knew that Hungary alone was not capable of challenging the [[Little Entente]] powers by forming an alliance with Austria and Italy.&lt;ref name="burgwyn"/&gt; Mussolini was elated by Gömbös' offer of alliance with Italy, and they cooperated in seeking to persuade Austrian Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] to join a tripartite economic agreement with Italy and Hungary.&lt;ref name="burgwyn"/&gt; At the meeting between Gömbös and Mussolini in Rome on 10 November 1932, the question came up of the sovereignty of Austria in relation to the predicted rise to power in Germany of the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name="burgwyn"/&gt; Mussolini was worried about Nazi ambitions towards Austria, and indicated that at least in the short term he was committed to maintaining Austria as a sovereign state.&lt;ref name="burgwyn"/&gt; Italy had concerns over a Germany which included Austria laying land claims to German-populated territories of the [[South Tyrol]] (also known as Alto-Adige) within Italy, which bordered Austria on the [[Brenner Pass]]. Gömbös responded to Mussolini that as the Austrians primarily identified as Germans, the [[Anschluss]] of Austria to Germany was inevitable, and advised that it would be better for Italy to have a friendly Germany across the [[Brenner Pass]] than a hostile Germany bent on entering the Adriatic.&lt;ref name="burgwyn"/&gt; Mussolini said he hoped the Anschluss could be postponed as long as possible until the breakout of a European war that he estimated would begin in 1938.&lt;ref name="burgwyn"/&gt;

[[File:Adolf Hitler-1933.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]], ''Führer and Reich Chancellor of the German People'', 1933–1945]]
In 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the Nazi Party [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] in Germany. His first diplomatic visitor was Gömbös. In a letter to Hitler within a day of his being appointed Chancellor, Gömbös told the Hungarian ambassador to Germany to remind Hitler "that ten years ago, on the basis of our common principles and ideology, we were in contact via Dr. Scheubner-Richter".&lt;ref&gt;Iván T. Berend, Tibor Iván Berend. ''Decades of Crisis: Central and Eastern Europe Before World War 2''. First paperback edition. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press, 2001. P. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Gömbös told the Hungarian ambassador to inform Hitler of Hungary's intentions "for the two countries to cooperate in foreign and economic policy".

Hitler had advocated an alliance between Germany and Italy since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Leitz. Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933–1941: The Road to Global War. Pp. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after being appointed Chancellor, Hitler sent a personal message to Mussolini, declaring "admiration and homage" and declaring his anticipation of the prospects of German-Italian friendship and even alliance.&lt;ref&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was aware that Italy held concerns over potential German land claims on South Tyrol, and assured Mussolini that Germany was not interested in South Tyrol. Hitler in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' had declared that South Tyrol was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German–Italian alliance. After Hitler's rise to power, the Four Power Directorate proposal by Italy had been looked at with interest by Britain, but Hitler was not committed to it, resulting in Mussolini urging Hitler to consider the diplomatic advantages Germany would gain by breaking out of isolation by entering the Directorate and avoiding an immediate armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Power Directorate proposal stipulated that Germany would no longer be required to have limited arms and would be granted the right to re-armament under foreign supervision in stages.&lt;ref name="burgwyn2"&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler completely rejected the idea of controlled rearmament under foreign supervision.&lt;ref name="burgwyn2"/&gt;

Mussolini did not trust Hitler's intentions regarding Anschluss nor Hitler's promise of no territorial claims on South Tyrol.&lt;ref name="burgwyn3"&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini informed Hitler that he was satisfied with the presence of the anti-Marxist government of Dollfuss in Austria, and warned Hitler that he was adamantly opposed to Anschluss.&lt;ref name="burgwyn3"/&gt; Hitler responded in contempt to Mussolini that he intended "to throw Dollfuss into the sea".&lt;ref name="burgwyn3"/&gt; With this disagreement over Austria, relations between Hitler and Mussolini steadily became more distant.&lt;ref name="burgwyn3"/&gt;

Hitler attempted to break the impasse with Italy over Austria by sending [[Hermann Göring]] to negotiate with Mussolini in 1933 to convince Mussolini to press the Austrian government to appoint members of Austria's Nazis to the government.&lt;ref name="burgwyn4"&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Göring claimed that Nazi domination of Austria was inevitable and that Italy should accept this, as well as repeating to Mussolini of Hitler's promise to "regard the question of the South Tyrol frontier as finally liquidated by the peace treaties".&lt;ref name="burgwyn4"/&gt; In response to Göring's visit with Mussolini, Dollfuss immediately went to Italy to counter any German diplomatic headway.&lt;ref name="burgwyn4"/&gt; Dollfuss claimed that his government was actively challenging Marxists in Austria and claimed that once the Marxists were defeated in Austria, that support for Austria's Nazis would decline.&lt;ref name="burgwyn4"/&gt;

In 1934, Hitler and Mussolini met for the first time, in [[Venice]]. The meeting did not proceed amicably. Hitler demanded that Mussolini compromise on Austria by pressuring Dollfuss to appoint Austrian Nazis to his cabinet, to which Mussolini flatly refused the demand. In response, Hitler promised that he would accept Austria's independence for the time being, saying that due to the internal tensions in Germany (referring to sections of the Nazi SA that Hitler would soon kill in the [[Night of the Long Knives]]) that Germany could not afford to provoke Italy.&lt;ref name="neville"&gt;Peter Neville. ''Mussolini''. London, England: Routledge, 2004. P. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galeazzo Ciano]] told the press that the two leaders had made a "gentleman's agreement" to avoid interfering in Austria.&lt;ref name="knickerbocker1941"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal &amp; Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=7–8| isbn=9781417992775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between Germany and Italy recovered due to Hitler's support of Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, while other countries condemned the invasion and advocated sanctions against Italy.

===Development of German–Italian–Japanese alliance===
[[File:Fumimaro Konoe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Fumimaro Konoe]], prime minister of Japan, 1937–1940]]

Interest in Germany and Japan in forming an alliance began when Japanese diplomat [[Oshima Hiroshi]] visited [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] in Berlin in 1935.&lt;ref name="boscaro"&gt;Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, (eds). ''Rethinking Japan. 1. Literature, visual arts &amp; linguistics''. pp. 32–39&lt;/ref&gt; Oshima informed von Ribbentrop of Japan's interest in forming a German–Japanese alliance against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="boscaro"/&gt; Von Ribbentrop expanded on Oshima's proposal by advocating that the alliance be based in a political context of a pact to oppose the [[Comintern]].&lt;ref name="boscaro"/&gt; The proposed pact was met with mixed reviews in Japan, with a faction of ultra-nationalists within the government supporting the pact while the Japanese Navy and the Japanese Foreign Ministry were staunchly opposed to the pact.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, (eds). ''Rethinking Japan. 1. Literature, visual arts &amp; linguistics''. P. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; There was great concern in the Japanese government that such a pact with Germany could disrupt Japan's relations with Britain, endangering years of a beneficial Anglo-Japanese accord, that had allowed Japan to ascend in the international community in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, (eds). ''Rethinking Japan. 1. Literature, visual arts &amp; linguistics''. P. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The response to the pact was met with similar division in Germany; while the proposed pact was popular amongst the upper echelons of the Nazi Party, it was opposed by many in the Foreign Ministry, the Army, and the business community who held financial interests in China to which Japan was hostile.

[[File:KarlHaushofer RudolfHess.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Haushofer]] and [[Rudolf Hess]], c.1920. Haushofer's ideas influenced the development of Adolf Hitler's expansionist strategies. He was instrumental in linking Japan to the Axis powers.]]

On learning of German–Japanese negotiations, Italy also began to take an interest in forming an alliance with Japan.&lt;ref name="boscaro"/&gt; Italy had hoped that due to Japan's long-term close relations with Britain, that an Italo-Japanese alliance could pressure Britain into adopting a more accommodating stance towards Italy in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="boscaro"/&gt; In the summer of 1936, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano informed Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Sugimura Yotaro, "I have heard that a Japanese–German agreement concerning the Soviet Union has been reached, and I think it would be natural for a similar agreement to be made between Italy and Japan".&lt;ref name="boscaro"/&gt; Initially Japan's attitude towards Italy's proposal was generally dismissive, viewing a German–Japanese alliance against the Soviet Union as imperative while regarding an Italo-Japanese alliance as secondary, as Japan anticipated that an Italo-Japanese alliance would antagonize Britain that had condemned Italy's invasion of Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="boscaro"/&gt; This attitude by Japan towards Italy altered in 1937 after the League of Nations condemned Japan for aggression in China and faced international isolation, while Italy remained favourable to Japan.&lt;ref name="boscaro"/&gt; As a result of Italy's support for Japan against international condemnation, Japan took a more positive attitude towards Italy and offered proposals for a non-aggression or neutrality pact with Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, (eds). ''Rethinking Japan. 1. Literature, visual arts &amp; linguistics''. Pp.&amp;nbsp;39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Axis powers" formally took the name after the Tripartite Pact was signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan on 27 September 1940, in Berlin. The pact was subsequently joined by Hungary (20 November 1940), Romania (23 November 1940), Slovakia (24 November 1940), and Bulgaria (1 March 1941).{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=91}}

==Ideology==
The Axis powers' primary goal was [[Expansionism|territorial expansion]] at the expense of their neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley Baranowski. ''Axis Imperialism in the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In ideological terms, the Axis described their goals as breaking the hegemony of the [[Plutocracy|plutocratic]] [[Western world|Western powers]] and defending civilization from [[communism]]. The Axis championed a number of variants on [[fascism]], [[militarism]], and [[autarky]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945''. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: University of Wisconsin Press, 1995. p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic resources==
The Axis population in 1938 was 258.9 million, while the Allied population (excluding the Soviet Union and the United States, which later joined the Allies) was 689.7 million.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=3}} Thus the Allied powers outnumbered the Axis powers by 2.7 to 1.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=4}} The leading Axis states had the following domestic populations: Germany 75.5 million (including 6.8 million from recently annexed [[Austria]]), Japan 71.9 million (excluding its colonies), and Italy 43.4 million (excluding its colonies). The United Kingdom (excluding its colonies) had a population of 47.5 million and France (excluding its colonies) 42 million.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=3}}

The wartime [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the Axis was $911 billion at its highest in 1941 in [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international dollars]] by 1990 prices.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=10}} The GDP of the Allied powers was $1,798 billion. The United States stood at $1,094 billion, more than the Axis combined.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=10, 25}}

The burden of the war upon participating countries has been measured through the percentage of [[gross national product]] (GNP) devoted to military expenditures.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}} Nearly one-quarter of Germany's GNP was committed to the war effort in 1939, and this rose to three-quarters of GNP in 1944, prior to the collapse of the economy.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}} In 1939, Japan committed 22 percent of its GNP to its war effort in China; this rose to three-quarters of GNP in 1944.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}} Italy did not mobilize its economy; its GNP committed to the war effort remained at prewar levels.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}}

Italy and Japan lacked industrial capacity; their economies were small, dependent on [[international trade]], external sources of fuel and other industrial resources.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}} As a result, Italian and Japanese mobilization remained low, even by 1943.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}}

Among the three major Axis powers, Japan had the lowest per capita income, while Germany and Italy had an income level comparable to the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=19}}

====War justifications====
Hitler in 1941 described the outbreak of World War II as the fault of the intervention of Western powers against Germany during its war with Poland, describing it as the result of "the European and American warmongers".&lt;ref name="Lewis Copeland 1999 Pp. 485"&gt;Lewis Copeland, Lawrence W. Lamm, Stephen J. McKenna. ''The World's Great Speeches: Fourth Enlarged (1999) Edition''. Pp. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler denied accusations by the Allies that he wanted a World War, and invoked [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] claims that the war was wanted and provoked by politicians of [[Jews|Jewish]] origin or associated with Jewish interests.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Richard L Rubenstein, John King Roth. Approaches to Auschwitz: The Holocaust And Its Legacy. Louisville, Kentucky, USA: Westminster John Knox Press, 2003. P. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; However Hitler clearly had designs for Germany to become the dominant and leading state in the world, such as his intention for Germany's capital of Berlin to become the ''Welthauptstadt'' ("World Capital"), renamed [[Welthauptstadt Germania|Germania]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitler's Germany: Origins, Interpretations, Legacies. London, England: Routledge, 1939. P. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The German government also justified its actions by claiming that Germany inevitably needed to territorially expand because it was facing an [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] crisis that Hitler described: "We are overpopulated and cannot feed ourselves from our own resources".&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Lee 1945. P. 237"&gt;Stephen J. Lee. Europe, 1890–1945. P. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus expansion was justified as an inevitable necessity to provide ''[[lebensraum]]'' ("living space") for the German nation and end the country's overpopulation within existing confined territory, and provide resources necessary to its people's well-being.&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Lee 1945. P. 237"/&gt; Since the 1920s, the Nazi Party publicly promoted the expansion of Germany into territories held by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Peter D. Stachura P. 31"&gt;Peter D. Stachura. The Shaping of the Nazi State. P. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1939 to 1941, the Nazi regime claimed to have discarded those plans in light of improved relations with the Soviet Union via the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], and claimed that [[central Africa]] was where Germany sought to achieve ''lebensraum''.&lt;ref name="John Stoessinger 2010. P38"&gt;John Stoessinger. ''Why Nations Go to War''. Cengage Learning, 2010. P38.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler publicly claimed that Germany wanted to settle the ''lebensraum'' issue peacefully through diplomatic negotiations that would require other powers to make concessions to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Weikart. ''Hitler's Ethic: The Nazi Pursuit of Evolutionary Progress''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. P167.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time however Germany did prepare for war in the cause of ''lebensraum'', and in the late 1930s Hitler emphasized the need for a military build-up to prepare for a potential clash between the peoples of Germany and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Weikart. ''Hitler's Ethic: The Nazi Pursuit of Evolutionary Progress''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. P168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany justified its war against Poland on the issues of German minority within Poland and Polish opposition to the incorporation of the ethnically German-majority [[Free City of Danzig]] into Germany. While Hitler and the Nazi party before taking power openly talked about destroying Poland and were hostile to Poles, after gaining power until February 1939 Hitler tried to conceal his true intentions towards Poland, and signed a 10-year Non-Aggression Pact in 1934,  revealing his plans to only to his closest associates.&lt;ref&gt;Stutthof.

Mirosław Gliński Geneza obozu koncentracyjnego Stutthof na tle hitlerowskich przygotowan w Gdansku do wojny z Polska&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between Germany and Poland altered from the early to the late 1930s, as Germany sought rapprochement with Poland to avoid the risk of Poland entering the Soviet sphere of influence, and appealed to anti-Soviet sentiment in Poland.&lt;ref name="Jan Karski 2014.

P44"&gt;Oscar Pinkus. ''The War Aims and Strategies of Adolf Hitler''. McFarland, 2005. P44.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1939, Ribbentrop held negotiations with [[Józef Beck]], the Polish minister of foreign affairs; and [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]], the commander-in-chief of the Polish Army; in which Ribbentrop urged them to have Poland enter the Anti-Comintern Pact and work together with Germany for a mutual war in the East, whereby Poland would take Slovakia and Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Oscar Pinkus 2005. P44"/&gt; Ribbentrop in private discussion with German officials stated that he hoped that by offering Poland large new territories in the Soviet Union, that Germany would gain not only from Polish cooperation in a war with the Soviet Union, but also that Poland would cooperate by transferring the Polish Corridor to Germany in exchange for these gains, because though it would lose access to the [[Baltic Sea]], it would gain access to the [[Black Sea]] via Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Oscar Pinkus 2005. P44"/&gt; However Beck refused to discuss German demands for the Corridor and was recalcitrant to the idea of a war with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Oscar Pinkus 2005. P44"/&gt; The Polish government distrusted Hitler and saw the plan as a threat to Polish sovereignty, practically subordinating Poland to the Axis and the Anti-Comintern Bloc while reducing the country to a state of near-servitude as its entire trade with Western Europe through the Baltic Sea would become dependent on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/ylbkmenu.asp|title=Avalon Project - The French Yellow Book|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Danzig crisis|diplomatic crisis erupted]] following Hitler demanding that the Free City of Danzig be annexed to Germany, as it was led by a Nazi government seeking annexation to Germany. Germany used legal precedents to justify its intervention against Poland and annexation of the [[Free City of Danzig]] (led by a local Nazi government that sought incorporation into Germany) in 1939.&lt;ref name="C. Kiss. 1989"&gt;A. C. Kiss. ''Hague Yearbook of International Law''. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany noted one such violation as being in 1933 when Poland sent additional troops into the city in violation of the limit of Polish troops admissible to Danzig as agreed to by treaty.&lt;ref name="C. Kiss. 1989"/&gt; Hitler believed that Poland could be pressured to cede claimed territory through diplomatic means combined with the threat of military force, and believed that Germany could gain such concessions from Poland without provoking a war with Britain or France.&lt;ref name="William Young 2006. P. 266"&gt;William Young. German Diplomatic Relations 1871–1945: The Wilhelmstrasse and the Formulation of Foreign Policy. iUniverse, 2006. P. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler believed that Britain's guarantee of military support to Poland was a bluff, and with a German-Soviet agreement on both countries recognizing their mutual interests involving Poland.&lt;ref name="William Young 2006. P. 266"/&gt; The Soviet Union had diplomatic grievances with Poland since the [[Soviet-Polish War]] of 1919–1921 in which the Soviets agreed that North-eastern Poland, Western [[Belarus]] and Western [[Ukraine]] will become part of restored Polish state after intense fighting in those years over the territories, and the Soviet Union sought to regain those territories.&lt;ref name="Eastern Europe 2004, Pp. 138-139"&gt;''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia 2004, Volume 4''. London, England: Europa Publications, 2003. Pp.&amp;nbsp;138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland rejected Germany's demands and Germany in response prepared a general mobilization on the morning of 30 August 1939.&lt;ref name="William Young 2006. P. 271"&gt;William Young. German Diplomatic Relations 1871–1945: The Wilhelmstrasse and the Formulation of Foreign Policy. iUniverse, 2006. P. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler believed that one of two outcomes would occur. The first was that the British would accept Germany's demands and pressure Poland to agree to them.&lt;ref name="William Young 2006. P. 271"/&gt; The second was that a conflict with Poland would be an isolated conflict, as Britain would not engage in a war with both Germany and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="William Young 2006. P. 266"/&gt; At midnight 30 August 1939, German foreign minister [[Joachim Ribbentrop]] was expecting the arrival of the British ambassador [[Nevile Henderson]] as well as a Polish plenipotentiary to negotiate terms with Germany.&lt;ref name="William Young 2006. P. 271"/&gt; Only Henderson arrived, and Henderson informed Ribbentrop that no Polish plenipotentiary was arriving.&lt;ref name="William Young 2006. P. 271"/&gt; Ribbentrop became extremely upset and demanded the immediate arrival of a Polish diplomat, informing Henderson that the situation was "damned serious!", and read out to Henderson Germany's demands that Poland accept Germany annexing Danzig as well as Poland granting Germany the right to increase the connection of the infrastructure of [[East Prussia]] to mainland Germany by building an extraterritorial highway and railway that passed through the Polish Gdansk Pomerania, and a [[plebiscite]] to determine whether the Polish Corridor, that had a mixed composition of ethnic Poles and ethnic Germans, should remain within Poland or be transferred to Germany.&lt;ref name="William Young 2006. P. 271"/&gt;

Germany justified its invasion of the [[Low Countries]] of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in May 1940 by claiming that it suspected that Britain and France were preparing to use the Low Countries to launch an invasion of the industrial [[Ruhr]] region of Germany.&lt;ref name="Gabrielle Kirk McDonald 2000. P. 649"&gt;Gabrielle Kirk McDonald. ''Documents and Cases, Volumes 1-2''. The Hague, Netherlands: Kluwer Law International, 2000. P. 649.&lt;/ref&gt; When war between Germany versus Britain and France appeared likely in May 1939, Hitler declared that the Netherlands and Belgium would need to be occupied, saying: "Dutch and Belgian air bases must be occupied&amp;nbsp;... Declarations of neutrality must be ignored".&lt;ref name="Gabrielle Kirk McDonald 2000. P. 649"/&gt; In a conference with Germany's military leaders on 23 November 1939, Hitler declared to the military leaders that "We have an [[Achilles heel]], the Ruhr", and said that "If England and France push through Belgium and Holland into the Ruhr, we shall be in the greatest danger", and thus claimed that Belgium and the Netherlands had to be occupied by Germany to protect Germany from a British-French offensive against the Ruhr, irrespective of their claims to neutrality.&lt;ref name="Gabrielle Kirk McDonald 2000. P. 649"/&gt;

In April 1941, shortly after Germany and Yugoslavia completed negotiations for Yugoslavia to join the Axis, a coup d'état occurred in Yugoslavia that led to the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. Germany needed access to the territory held by Yugoslavia to allow German forces to have a direct route to travel through, to reach and rescue Italian military forces that were faltering in their campaign in Greece. There was substantial animosity towards the alliance amongst Serbs, Yugoslavia's largest ethnic group, who had fought German Austrians and Germany on the side of the Allies in World War I, and three Serb cabinet ministers resigned their positions in protest after the alliance was signed. Hitler initially attempted to be conciliatory to the Serbs who held animosity to the agreement, saying that he "understood the feelings" of those Serbs who opposed the alliance. Amidst the negotiations, Hitler expressed concern to Italian foreign minister Ciano that he sensed trouble coming in Belgrade. A coup d'état occurred in Yugoslavia in which a government rose to power and abandoned its association with the Axis. Hitler accused the coup of being engineered by the British. The coup was at least partly supported by the British though there was substantial patriotic enthusiasm against the Pact with rallies in Belgrade. At the rallies in Belgrade immediately after the coup, people were heard to be shouting "Better war than pact!" and waving British, American, and French flags. Days after the coup d'état, Hitler ordered the German General Staff to plan for an invasion of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;John Lukacs. The Last European War: September 1939 - December 1941. Yale University Press, 2001. pp. 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 involved issues of ''lebensraum'', [[anti-communism]], and Soviet foreign policy. Hitler in his early years as Nazi leader had claimed that he would be willing to accept friendly relations with Russia on the tactical condition that Russia agree to return to the borders established by the German–Russian peace agreement of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] signed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]] in 1918 which gave large territories held by Russia to German control in exchange for peace.&lt;ref name="Peter D. Stachura P. 31" /&gt; Hitler in 1921 had commended the Treaty of Brest Litovsk as opening the possibility for restoration of relations between Germany and Russia, saying:
{{quote|Through the peace with Russia the sustenance of Germany as well as the provision of work were to have been secured by the acquisition of land and soil, by access to raw materials, and by friendly relations between the two lands.|Adolf Hitler, 1921&lt;ref name="Peter D. Stachura P. 31"/&gt;}}
From 1921 to 1922 Hitler evoked rhetoric of both the achievement of lebensraum involving the acceptance of a territorially reduced Russia as well as supporting Russian nationals in overthrowing the Bolshevik government and establishing a new Russian government.&lt;ref name="Peter D. Stachura P. 31"/&gt; However Hitler's attitudes changed by the end of 1922, in which he then supported an alliance of Germany with Britain to destroy Russia.&lt;ref name="Peter D. Stachura P. 31"/&gt; Later Hitler declared how far into Russia he intended to expand Germany to:

{{quote|Asia, what a disquieting reservoir of men! The safety of Europe will not be assured until we have driven Asia back behind the Urals. No organized Russian state must be allowed to exist west of that line.|Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref name="André Mineau 2004. P. 36"&gt;André Mineau. Operation Barbarossa: Ideology and Ethics Against Human Dignity. Rodopi, 2004. P. 36&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Policy for ''[[lebensraum]]'' planned mass expansion of Germany's borders as far eastwards as the [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref name="André Mineau 2004. P. 36"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Dieter Müller, Gerd R. Ueberschär. ''Hitler's War in the East, 1941–1945: A Critical Assessment''. Berghahn Books, 2009.

''The Second World War: Ambitions to Nemesis''. London, England; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2004. P. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; After Germany invaded the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941, the Nazi regime's stance towards an independent, territorially-reduced Russia was affected by pressure beginning in 1942 from the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] on Hitler to endorse a Russian national liberation army led by [[Andrey Vlasov]] that officially sought to overthrow [[Joseph Stalin]] and the communist regime and establish a new Russian state.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey A. Hosking. ''Rulers And Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union''. Harvard University Press, 2006 P. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the proposal to support an anti-communist Russian army was met with outright rejection by Hitler, however by 1944 as Germany faced mounting losses on the Eastern Front, Vlasov's forces were recognized by Germany as an ally, particularly by [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Andreyev. ''Vlasov and the Russian Liberation Movement: Soviet Reality and Emigré Theories''. First paperback edition. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1989. Pp. 53, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed, in 1940 when Molotov arrived in Berlin on a diplomatic visit during which Ribbentrop stated that Germany was directing its ''lebensraum'' southward.&lt;ref&gt;Robyn Lim. The Geopolitics of East Asia. Routledge, 2003. Pp. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Ribbentrop described to Molotov that further extension of Germany's ''lebensraum'' was now going to be founded in [[Central Africa]], and suggested that Germany would accept the Soviet Union taking part in the partitioning of the British Empire upon a British defeat in the war.&lt;ref name="John Stoessinger 2010. P38"/&gt;

Germany and the Soviet Union in 1940 were in dispute over their respective influences in the Balkans, Bulgaria, the Danube and the [[Turkish Straits]]. The Soviet seizure of [[Bessarabia]] from Romania in June 1940 placed the Soviet–Romanian frontier dangerously close to Romania's oil fields in [[Ploiești]] that Germany needed oil trade from to support its war effort.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;David R. Stone. A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya. P195.&lt;/ref&gt; When negotiations with Molotov led to no resolution, Hitler determined that Britain was only continuing to fight in hope of Soviet intervention and therefore the defeat of the Soviet Union would result in the defeat of Britain and in July 1940 began planning for a possible invasion of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

After the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States, Germany supported Japan by declaring war on the US. During the war Germany denounced the [[Atlantic Charter]] and the [[Lend-Lease Act]] that the US adopted to support the Allied powers prior to entry into the alliance, as imperialism directed at dominating and exploit countries outside of the continental [[Americas]].&lt;ref name="Randall Bennett Woods 1990. P. 200"&gt;Randall Bennett Woods. ''A Changing of the Guard: Anglo-American Relations, 1941–1946''. University of North Carolina Press, 1990. P. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler denounced American President Roosevelt's invoking of the term "freedom" to describe US actions in the war, and accused the American meaning of "freedom" to be the freedom for democracy to exploit the world and the freedom for plutocrats within such democracy to exploit the masses.&lt;ref name="Randall Bennett Woods 1990. P. 200"/&gt;

====History====

At the end of World War I, German citizens felt that their country had been humiliated as a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which included a [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|war guilt clause]] and forced Germany to pay enormous reparations payments and forfeit territories formerly controlled by German Empire and all its colonies. The pressure of the reparations on the German economy led to [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation during the early 1920s]]. In 1923 [[Occupation of the Ruhr|the French occupied the Ruhr region]] when Germany defaulted on its reparations payments. Although Germany began to improve economically in the mid-1920s, the [[Great Depression]] created more economic hardship and a rise in political forces that advocated radical solutions to Germany's woes. The Nazis, under Hitler, promoted the nationalist [[stab-in-the-back legend]] stating that Germany had been betrayed by Jews and Communists. The party promised to rebuild Germany as a major power and create a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] that would include [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Austria]], [[Sudetenland]], and other German-populated territories in Europe. The Nazis also aimed to occupy and colonize non-German territories in [[Poland]], the [[Baltic states]], and the Soviet Union, as part of the Nazi policy of seeking ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space") in eastern Europe.

Germany renounced the Versailles treaty and [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the Rhineland]] in March 1936. Germany had already resumed conscription and announced the existence of a German air force, the [[Luftwaffe]], and naval force, the [[Kriegsmarine]] in 1935. Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria in 1938]], the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Sudetenland]] from Czechoslovakia, and the [[Memel territory]] from [[Lithuania]] in 1939. Germany then invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939, creating the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the country of [[Slovakia]].

On 23 August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which contained a secret protocol dividing eastern Europe into spheres of influence.{{sfn|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} Germany's invasion of its part of Poland under the Pact eight days later{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} triggered the beginning of World War II. By the end of 1941, Germany occupied a large part of Europe and [[Wehrmacht|its military forces]] were fighting the Soviet Union, nearly capturing Moscow. However, crushing defeats at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Kursk]] devastated the German armed forces. This, combined with Western Allied [[Normandy Landings|landings in France]] and [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Italy]], led to a three-front war that depleted Germany's armed forces and resulted in Germany's defeat in 1945.

There was substantial internal opposition within the German military to the Nazi regime's aggressive strategy of rearmament and foreign policy in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Command Magagzine. Hitler's Army: The Evolution and Structure of German Forces 1933–1945. P. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1936 to 1938, Germany's top four military leaders, [[Ludwig Beck]], [[Werner von Blomberg]], [[Werner von Fritsch]], [[Walther von Reichenau]], were all in opposition to the rearmament strategy and foreign policy.&lt;ref name="Command Magagzine 1945. P. 175"&gt;Command Magagzine. Hitler's Army: The Evolution and Structure of German Forces 1933–1945. Da Capo Press, 1996. P. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; They criticized the hurried nature of rearmament, the lack of planning, Germany's insufficient resources to carry out a war, the dangerous implications of Hitler's foreign policy, and the increasing subordination of the army to the Nazi Party's rules.&lt;ref name="Command Magagzine 1945. P. 175"/&gt; These four military leaders were outspoken and public in their opposition to these tendencies.&lt;ref name="Command Magagzine 1945. P. 175"/&gt; The Nazi regime responded with contempt to the four military leaders' opposition, and Nazi members brewed a false crass scandal that alleged that the two top army leaders von Blomberg and von Fritsch were [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] lovers, in order to pressure them to resign.&lt;ref name="Command Magagzine 1945. P. 175"/&gt; Though started by lower-ranking Nazi members, Hitler took advantage of the scandal by forcing von Blomberg and von Fritsch to resign and replaced them with opportunists who were subservient to him.&lt;ref name="Command Magagzine 1945. P. 175"/&gt; Shortly afterwards Hitler announced on 4 February 1938 that he was taking personal command over Germany's military with the new High Command of the Armed Forces with the ''Führer'' as its head.&lt;ref name="Command Magagzine 1945. P. 175"/&gt;

The opposition to the Nazi regime's aggressive foreign policy in the military became so strong from 1936 to 1938, that considerations of overthrowing the Nazi regime were discussed within the upper echelons of the military and remaining non-Nazi members of the German government.&lt;ref name="Michael C. Thomsett 1945. P. 40"&gt;Michael C. Thomsett. The German Opposition to Hitler: The Resistance, The Underground, And Assassination Plots, 1938–1945. McFarland, 2007. P. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of Economics, [[Hjalmar Schacht]] met with Beck in 1936 in which Schacht declared to Beck that he was considering an overthrow of the Nazi regime and was inquiring what the stance was by the German military on support of an overthrow of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name="Michael C. Thomsett 1945. P. 40"/&gt; Beck was lukewarm to the idea, and responded that if a coup against the Nazi regime began with support at the civilian level, the military would not oppose it.&lt;ref name="Michael C. Thomsett 1945. P. 40"/&gt; Schacht considered this promise by Beck to be inadequate because he knew that without the support of the army, any coup attempt would be crushed by the [[Gestapo]] and the SS.&lt;ref name="Michael C. Thomsett 1945. P. 41"&gt;Michael C. Thomsett. The German Opposition to Hitler: The Resistance, The Underground, And Assassination Plots, 1938–1945. McFarland, 2007. P. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1938, Beck became a firm opponent of the Nazi regime out of his opposition to Hitler's military plans of 1937–38 that told the military to prepare for the possibility of a world war as a result of German annexation plans for Austria and Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="Michael C. Thomsett 1945. P. 41"/&gt;

====Colonies and dependencies====
{{further|Areas annexed by Nazi Germany|German-occupied Europe}}

The [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was created from the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Shortly after Germany annexed the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, Slovakia declared its independence. The new [[Slovak State]] allied itself with Germany. The remainder of the country was occupied by German military forces and organized into the Protectorate. Czech civil institutions were preserved but the Protectorate was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.

The [[General Government]] was the name given to the territories of occupied Poland that were not directly annexed into German provinces, but like Bohemia and Moravia was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.

Belgium quickly surrendered to Germany, and the Belgian King remained in the country during the German military occupation from 1940 to 1944. The Belgian King cooperated closely with Germany and repeatedly sought assurances that Belgian rights would be retained once Germany achieved total victory. However, Hitler intended to annex Belgium and its Germanic population into the Greater Germanic Reich, initiated by the creation of [[Reichskommissariat Belgien]], an authority run directly by the German government that sought the incorporation of the territory into the planned Germanic Reich. However Belgium was soon occupied by Allied forces in 1944.

[[Reichskommissariat Niederlande]] was an occupation authority and territory established in the Netherlands in 1940 designated as a colony to be incorporated into the planned Greater Germanic Reich.

[[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]] was established in Norway in 1940. Like the Reichskommissariats in Belgium and the Netherlands, its Germanic peoples were to be incorporated into the Greater Germanic Reich. In Norway, the [[Quisling regime]], headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]], was installed by the Germans as a client regime [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|during the occupation]], while king [[Haakon VII]] and the legal [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government were in exile]]. Quisling encouraged Norwegians to serve as volunteers [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|in the Waffen-SS]], collaborated in the deportation of Jews, and was responsible for the executions of members of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]].

About 45,000 Norwegian collaborators joined the pro-Nazi party ''[[Nasjonal Samling]]'' (National Union), and some police units helped arrest many Jews. However, Norway was one of the first countries where [[resistance during World War II]] was widespread before the turning point of the war in 1943. After the war, [[Legal purge in Norway after World War II|Quisling and other collaborators were executed]]. Quisling's name has become an international [[eponym]] for [[traitor]].

[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]] was established in the Baltic region in 1941. Unlike the western Reichskommissariats that sought the incorporation of their majority Germanic peoples, Ostland were designed for settlement by Germans who would displace the non-Germanic majority living there, as part of ''lebensraum''.

[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] was established in Ukraine in 1941. Like Ostland it was slated for settlement by Germans.

The [[Military Administration in Serbia]] was established on occupied [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] territory in April 1941, following the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion of the country]]. On 30 April a pro-German Serbian administration was formed under [[Milan Aćimović]] to serve as a civil administration in the military occupation zone. A joint [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] and [[Chetnik]] uprising in late 1941 became a serious concern for the Germans, as most of their forces were deployed to Russia; only three divisions were in the country. On 13 August 546 Serbs, including some of the country's prominent and influential leaders, issued an appeal to the Serbian nation that condemned the Partisan and royalist resistance as unpatriotic. Two weeks after the appeal, with the Partisan and royalist insurgency beginning to gain momentum, 75 prominent Serbs convened a meeting in Belgrade and formed a [[Government of National Salvation]] under Serbian General [[Milan Nedić]] to replace the existing Serbian administration. The Germans were short of police and military forces in Serbia, and came to rely on poorly armed Serbian formations, the [[Serbian State Guard]] and [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]], to maintain order. These forces, however, were not able to contain the resistance, and for the most of the war large parts of Serbia were under control of the Partisans or Chetniks (the two resistance movements soon became mutually-hostile). The Government of National Salvation, imbued with few powers upon formation, saw its functions further decreased and taken over by the [[Wehrmacht]] occupation authorities as the war progressed. After the initial mass revolts, the German authorities instituted an extreme regime of reprisals, proclaiming that 100 civilians would be executed for every German soldier killed, and 50 for each one wounded. These measures were actually implemented on more than one occasion: large-scale shootings took place in the Serbian towns of [[Kraljevo massacre|Kraljevo]] and [[Kragujevac massacre|Kragujevac]] during October 1941.

====War justifications====

''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] described Italy's declaration of war against the Western Allies of Britain and France in June 1940 as the following: "We are going to war against the [[Plutocracy|plutocratic]] and [[reactionary]] [[Democracy|democracies]] of the [[Western world|West]] who have invariably hindered the progress and often threatened the very existence of the [[Italians|Italian people]]".&lt;ref&gt;John Whittam. ''Fascist Italy''. Manchester, England; New York, New York, USA: Manchester University Press. P. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy condemned the Western powers for enacting sanctions on Italy in 1935 for its actions in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] that Italy claimed was a response to an act of Ethiopian aggression against tribesmen in [[Italian Eritrea]] in the Walwal incident of 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brecher, Jonathan Wilkenfeld. Study of Crisis. University of Michigan Press, 1997. P. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy, like Germany, also justified its actions by claiming that Italy needed to territorially expand to provide ''[[spazio vitale]]'' ("vital space") for the Italian nation.&lt;ref name="rodogno46"&gt;*{{Cite book|first=Davide|last=Rodogno|title=Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation During the Second World War |location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|pages=46–48|isbn=978-0-521-84515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1938 in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement, Italy demanded concessions from France to yield to Italy: a [[List of free ports|free port]] at Djibouti, control of the [[Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad]], Italian participation in the management of [[Suez Canal Company]], some form of French-Italian [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] over Tunisia, and the preservation of Italian culture in French-held Corsica with no French assimilation of the people.&lt;ref name="H.

Italy justified its [[Greco-Italian War|intervention against Greece in October 1940]] on the allegation that Greece was being used by Britain against Italy, Mussolini informed this to Hitler, saying: "Greece is one of the main points of English maritime strategy in the Mediterranean".&lt;ref name="John Lukacs 1941.

Italy justified its [[invasion of Yugoslavia|intervention against Yugoslavia in April 1941]] by appealing to both Italian irredentist claims and the fact of [[Albanians|Albanian]], [[Croats|Croatian]], and [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Macedonian]] separatists not wishing to be part of [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="Jozo Tomasevich P. 30-31"&gt;Jozo Tomasevich.

====History====

In the late 19th century, after [[Italian unification]], a [[Italian nationalism|nationalist]] movement had grown around the concept of ''[[Italia irredenta]]'', which advocated the incorporation into Italy of Italian-populated areas still under foreign rule. There was a desire to annex [[Dalmatia]]n territories, which had formerly been ruled by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], and which consequently had Italian-speaking elites. The intention of the Fascist regime was to create a "[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]" in which Italy would dominate the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. In 1935–1936 [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italy invaded and annexed Ethiopia]] and the Fascist government proclaimed the creation of the "Italian Empire".{{sfn|Lowe|Marzari|2002|p=289}} Protests by the [[League of Nations]], especially the British, who had interests in that area, led to no serious action, although The League did try to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. In 1937 Italy left the League of Nations and joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which had been signed by Germany and Japan the preceding year. In March/April 1939 Italian troops invaded and annexed [[Albania]]. Germany and Italy signed the [[Pact of Steel]] on May 22.

Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. In September 1940 Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]].

Italy was ill-prepared for war, in spite of the fact that it had continuously been involved in conflict since 1935, first with Ethiopia in 1935–1936 and then in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the side of [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]].{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40–41}} 
Mussolini refused to heed warnings from his minister of exchange and currency, Felice Guarneri, who said that Italy's actions in Ethiopia and Spain meant that Italy was on the verge of bankruptcy.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} By 1939 military expenditures by Britain and France far exceeded what Italy could afford.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} As a result of Italy's economic difficulties its soldiers were poorly paid, often being poorly equipped and poorly supplied, and animosity arose between soldiers and class-conscious officers; these contributed to low morale amongst Italian soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel W. Mitcham]]: ''Rommel's Desert War: The Life and Death of the Afrika Korps''. Stackpole Books, 2007. P16.&lt;/ref&gt; Military planning was deficient, as the Italian government had not decided on which theatre would be the most important. Power over the military was overcentralized to Mussolini's direct control; he personally undertook to direct the ministry of war, the navy, and the air force. The navy did not have any aircraft carriers to provide air cover for amphibious assaults in the Mediterranean, as the Fascist regime believed that the air bases on the Italian Peninsula would be able to do this task.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|pp=38–40}} Italy's army had outmoded artillery and the armoured units used outdated formations not suited to modern warfare.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40}} Diversion of funds to the air force and navy to prepare for overseas operations meant less money was available for the army; the standard rifle was a design that dated back to 1891.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} The Fascist government failed to learn from mistakes made in Ethiopia and Spain; it ignored the implications of the Italian Fascist volunteer soldiers being routed at the [[Battle of Guadalajara]] in the Spanish Civil War.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} Military exercises by the army in the [[Po Valley]] in August 1939 disappointed onlookers, including King Victor Emmanuel III.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40}} Mussolini who was angered by Italy's military unpreparedness, dismissed [[Alberto Pariani]] as Chief of Staff of the Italian military in 1939.&lt;ref name="Neville Wylie 2002. Pp. 143"&gt;Neville Wylie. ''European Neutrals and Non-Belligerents during the Second World War''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Pp. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy's only strategic natural resource was an abundance of aluminum. Petroleum, iron, copper, nickel, chrome, and rubber all had to be imported.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40}} The Fascist government's economic policy of [[autarky]] and a recourse to synthetic materials was not able to meet the demand.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40–41}} Prior to entering the war, the Fascist government sought to gain control over resources in the [[Balkans]], particularly oil from [[Romania during World War II|Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Neville Wylie. ''European Neutrals and Non-Belligerents during the Second World War''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Pp. 142=143.&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union to invade and partition Poland between them resulted in Hungary that bordered the Soviet Union after Poland's partition, and Romania viewing Soviet invasion as an immediate threat, resulting in both countries appealing to Italy for support, beginning in September 1939.&lt;ref name="Neville Wylie 2002. Pp. 143"/&gt; Italy - then still officially neutral - responded to appeals by the Hungarian and Romanian governments for protection from the Soviet Union, by proposing a Danube-Balkan neutrals bloc.&lt;ref name="Neville Wylie 2002. Pp. 143"/&gt; The proposed bloc was designed to increase Italian influence in the Balkans: it met resistance from France, Germany, and the Soviet Union that did not want to lose their influence in the Balkans; however Britain, who believed that Italy would not enter the war on Germany's side, supported the neutral bloc.&lt;ref name="Neville Wylie 2002. Pp. 143"/&gt; The efforts to form the bloc failed by November 1939 after [[Turkey]] made an agreement that it would protect Allied Mediterranean territory, along with [[Greece during World War II|Greece]] and Romania.&lt;ref name="Neville Wylie 2002. Pp. 143"/&gt;

Initially upon the outbreak of war between Germany and the Allies, Mussolini pursued a non-belligerent role for Italy out of concerns that Germany may not win its war with the Allies. However Mussolini in private grew anxious that Italy not intervening in support of Germany in September 1939 upon Britain and France waging war on Germany, would eventually result in retribution by Germany if Italy did not get involved in the war on Germany's side.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mallett, Gert Sorensen. International Fascism, 1919-45. Routledge, 2002, 2011. P48.&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1940, Italy was still a non-belligerent, and Mussolini communicated to Hitler that Italy was not prepared to intervene soon. By March 1940, Mussolini decided that Italy would intervene, but the date was not yet chosen. His senior military leadership unanimously opposed the action because Italy was unprepared. No raw materials had been stockpiled and the reserves it did have would soon be exhausted, Italy's industrial base was only one-tenth of Germany's, and even with supplies the Italian military was not organized to provide the equipment needed to fight a modern war of a long duration. An ambitious rearmament program was impossible because of Italy's limited reserves in gold and foreign currencies and lack of raw materials. Mussolini ignored the negative advice.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. W. Kavanaugh. ''Hitler's Malta Option: A Comparison of the Invasion of Crete (Operation Merkur) and the Proposed Invasion of Malta'' (Nimble Books LLC, 2010). p20.&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 1938 report by German Naval High Command (OKM) warned that Italy as a combatant ally would be a serious "burden" to Germany if a war between Germany and Britain occurred, and recommended that it would be preferable for Germany to seek for Italy to be a "benevolent neutral" during the war. On 18 March 1940, Hitler told Mussolini in person that the war would be over by the summer and that Italy's military involvement was not required.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanaugh, ''Hitler's Malta Option'' p 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini on 29 May 1940 discussed the situation of the Italian Army in which he acknowledged that it was not ideal but believed that it was satisfactory, and discussed the timeline for a declaration of war on Britain and France. He said: "a delay of two weeks or a month would not be an improvement, and Germany could think we entered the war when the risk was very small ... And this could be a burden on us when peace comes."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mallett, Gert Sorensen. International Fascism, 1919-45. Routledge, 2002, 2011. P49.&lt;/ref&gt;

After entering the war in 1940, Italy had been slated to be granted a series of territorial concessions from France that Hitler had agreed to with Italian foreign minister Ciano, that included Italian annexation of claimed territories in southeastern France, a military occupation of southeastern France up to the river [[Rhone]], and receiving the French colonies of [[French Tunisia|Tunisia]] and [[Djibouti]].&lt;ref name="Aristotle A. Kallis 1945. P. 175"&gt;Aristotle A. Kallis. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-s2FAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fascist Ideology: Territory and Expansionism in Italy and Germany, 1922–1945]'' p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 22 June 1940, Mussolini suddenly informed Hitler that Italy was abandoning its claims "in the Rhone, Corsica, Tunisia, and Djibouti", instead requesting a demilitarized zone along the French border, and on 24 June Italy agreed to an armistice with the [[Vichy regime]] to that effect.&lt;ref name="Aristotle A. Kallis 1945. P. 175"/&gt; Later on 7 July 1940, the Italian government changed its decision, and Ciano attempted to make an agreement with Hitler to have [[Nice]], Corsica, Tunisia, and Djibouti be transferred to Italy; Hitler adamantly rejected any new settlement or separate French-Italian peace agreement for the time being prior to the defeat of Britain in the war.&lt;ref name="Aristotle A. Kallis 1945. P. 175"/&gt; However Italy continued to press Germany for the incorporation of Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia into Italy, with Mussolini sending a letter to Hitler in October 1940, informing him that as the 850,000 Italians living under France's current borders formed the largest minority community, that ceding these territories to Italy would be beneficial to both Germany and Italy as it would reduce France's population from 35 million to 34 and forestall any possibility of resumed French ambitions for expansion or hegemony in Europe.&lt;ref name="Aristotle A. Kallis 1945. P. 175"/&gt; Germany had considered the possibility of invading and occupying the non-occupied territories of Vichy France including occupying Corsica; Germany capturing the Vichy French fleet for use by Germany, in December 1940 with the proposed [[Operation Attila (World War II)|Operation Attila]].&lt;ref&gt;Deist, Wilhelm; Klaus A. Maier et al. (1990). ''Germany and the Second World War. Oxford University Press''. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; An invasion of Vichy France by Germany and Italy took place with [[Case Anton]] in November 1942.

In mid-1940, in response to an agreement by Romanian ''Conducător'' [[Ion Antonescu]] to accept German "training troops" to be sent to Romania, both Mussolini and Stalin in the Soviet Union were angered by Germany's expanding sphere of influence into Romania, and especially because neither was informed in advance of the action in spite of German agreements with Italy and the Soviet Union at that time.&lt;ref name="John Lukacs 1941. P. 116"/&gt; Mussolini in a conversation with Ciano responded to Hitler's deployment of troops into Romania, saying: "Hitler always faces me with accomplished facts. Now I'll pay him back by his same currency. He'll learn from the papers that I have occupied Greece. So the balance will be re-established.".&lt;ref name="John Lukacs 1941. P. 116"/&gt; However Mussolini later decided to inform Hitler in advance of Italy's designs on Greece.&lt;ref name="John Lukacs 1941. P. 116"/&gt; Upon hearing of Italy's intervention against Greece, Hitler was deeply concerned as he said that the Greeks were not bad soldiers that Italy might not win in its war with Greece, as he did not want Germany to become embroiled in a Balkan conflict.&lt;ref name="John Lukacs 1941. P. 116"/&gt;

By 1941, Italy's attempts to run an autonomous campaign from Germany's, collapsed as a result of military setbacks in Greece, [[North Africa]], and [[Eastern Africa]]; and the country became dependent and effectively subordinate to Germany. After the German-led invasion and occupation of [[Yugoslavia during World War II|Yugoslavia]] and Greece, that had both been targets of Italy's war aims, Italy was forced to accept German dominance in the two occupied countries.&lt;ref name="pp284"&gt;Mussolini Unleashed, 1939–1941: Politics and Strategy in Fascist Italy's Last War. Pp.&amp;nbsp;284–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, by 1941, German forces in North Africa under [[Erwin Rommel]] effectively took charge of the military effort ousting Allied forces from the Italian colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]], and German forces were stationed in [[Sicily]] in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Knight. Mussolini and Fascism. Pp. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Germany's insolence towards Italy as an ally was demonstrated that year when Italy was pressured to send 350,000 "guest workers" to Germany who were used as forced labour.&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;Patricia Knight. ''Mussolini and Fascism''. Routledge, 2003. P. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; While Hitler was disappointed with the Italian military's performance, he maintained overall favorable relations with Italy because of his personal friendship with Mussolini.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rodogno. ''Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation during the Second World War''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2006. P. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini by mid-1941 recognized that Italy's war objectives had failed.&lt;ref name="pp284"/&gt; Mussolini henceforth believed that Italy was left with no choice in such a subordinate status other than to follow Germany in its war and hope for a German victory.&lt;ref name="pp284"/&gt; However Germany supported Italian propaganda of the creation of a "Latin Bloc" of Italy, [[Vichy France]], [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], and [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] to ally with Germany against the threat of [[communism]], and after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the prospect of a Latin Bloc seemed plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Allitt. Catholic Converts: British and American Intellectuals Turn to Rome. Ithaca, New York, USA: Cornell University, 1997. P. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1940 to 1941, [[Francisco Franco]] of Spain had endorsed a Latin Bloc of Italy, Vichy France, Spain and Portugal, in order to balance the countries' powers to that of Germany; however, the discussions failed to yield an agreement.&lt;ref name="John Lukacs"&gt;John Lukacs. ''The Last European War: September 1939-December 1941''. Yale University Press, 2001. P. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia, Italy annexed numerous Adriatic islands and a portion of [[Dalmatia]] that was formed into the Italian [[Governorship of Dalmatia]] including territory from the provinces of [[Split (city)|Spalato]], [[Zadar|Zara]], and [[Kotor|Cattaro]].&lt;ref name="Davide Rodogno 2006. Pp. 80-81"&gt;Davide Rodogno. Fascism's European empire: Italian occupation during the Second World War. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2006. Pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Italy had initially larger territorial aims that extended from the [[Velebit|Velebit mountains]] to the [[Albanian Alps]], Mussolini decided against annexing further territories due to a number of factors, including that Italy held the economically valuable portion of that territory within its possession while the northern Adriatic coast had no important railways or roads and because a larger annexation would have included hundreds of thousands of Slavs who were hostile to Italy, within its national borders.&lt;ref name="Davide Rodogno 2006. Pp. 80-81"/&gt; Mussolini and foreign minister Ciano demanded that the Yugoslav region of [[Slovenia]] to be directly annexed into Italy, however in negotiations with German foreign minister Ribbentrop in April 1941, Ribbentrop insisted on Hitler's demands that Germany be allocated the eastern Slovenia while Italy would be allocated western Slovenia, Italy conceded to this German demand and Slovenia was partitioned between Germany and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rodogno. ''Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation during the Second World War''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2006. P. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the commencing of the Allies' [[Operation Torch]] against Vichy French-held Morocco and Algeria, Germany and Italy intervened in Vichy France and in Vichy French-held Tunisia. Italy seized military control over a significant portion of southern France and Corsica, while a joint German-Italian force seized control over most of Tunisia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mussolini Warlord: Failed Dreams of Empire, 1940-1943&lt;/ref&gt; When the issue of sovereign control over Tunisia arose from seizure of control by the German-Italian force from Vichy French control, Ribbentrop proclaimed Italian predominance in Tunisia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, in spite of Germany's claim to respect Italian predominance, Germans supervised public services and local government in Tunisia, and the German presence was more popular in Tunisia with both the local Arab population and Vichy French collaborators since Germany had no imperial aspirations in Tunisia while Italy did.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Internal opposition by Italians to the war and the Fascist regime accelerated by 1942, though significant opposition to the war had existed at the outset in 1940, as police reports indicated that many Italians were secretly listening to the [[BBC]] rather than Italian media in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neville. Mussolini. Pp. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Underground Catholic, Communist, and socialist newspapers began to become prominent by 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neville. Mussolini. P. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 1941, Victor Emmanuel III visited Italian soldiers on the front in Yugoslavia and Albania, he was dismayed by the Fascist regime's brutal imperialism in Dalmatia, Slovenia, and Montenegro because he suspected it would impose impossible burdens on Italy by creating new enemies among the occupied peoples that Italy would be forced to fight.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Denis Mack Smith. Italy and Its Monarchy. P295.&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Emmanuel was disappointed with the Italian military's performance in the war, as he noted the army, navy, and air force could not drop their mutual jealousies and competition to work together.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Furthermore, he feared that overly ambitious generals attempting to win promotion were attempting to persuade Mussolini to divert military resources in an ever-widening field of action.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In June 1941, Mussolini's decision to follow Germany by waging war on the Soviet Union in which Victor Emmanuel was informed at the last moment giving him time only to advise to Mussolini against sending anything more than a token force to fight against the Soviet Union; his advice was not taken.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; A few weeks after Italy's declaration of war against the Soviet Union, a senior general of the ''[[Carabinieri]]'' informed the royal palace that the military police were awaiting a royal order to act against the Fascist regime.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In September 1941, Victor Emmanuel held a private discussion with Ciano, in which Ciano said to the King that Fascism was doomed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 1942, opposition to Italy's involvement in the war expanded among the Fascist regime's senior officials, with [[Giuseppe Bottai]] in private stating that he and other Fascist officials should have resigned from office when Mussolini declared war on Britain and France in June 1940, while [[Dino Grandi]] approached the King urging him to dismantle Mussolini's dictatorship in order to withdraw Italy from the war as he saw Italy facing ruin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Denis Mack Smith. Italy and Its Monarchy. P296.&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1943, King Victor Emmanuel III was persuaded by the Minister of the Royal Household, the Duke of Acquarone that Mussolini had to be removed from office.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neville. Mussolini. P. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1943, the first sign of serious rebellion by Italians against the Fascist regime and the war began with a strike by factory workers who were joined by soldiers singing communist songs and even rank-in-file Fascist party members.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The Fascist regime also faced passive resistance by civil servants who had begun to refuse to obey orders or pretend to obey orders.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

On 25 July 1943, following the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed Mussolini, placed him under arrest, and began secret negotiations with the Western Allies. An [[armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|armistice]] was signed on 8 September 1943, and Italy joined the Allies as a [[Co-belligerence|co-belligerent]]. On 12 September 1943, Mussolini was rescued by the Germans in [[Gran Sasso raid|Operation Oak]] and placed in charge of a puppet state called the [[Italian Social Republic]] (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana''/RSI, or ''Repubblica di Salò'') in [[northern Italy]]. The war went on for months as the Allies, the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]] and the [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] contended the Social Republic's forces and its German allies. Some areas in Northern Italy were liberated from the Germans as late as May, 1945. Mussolini was killed by Communist partisans on 28 April 1945 while trying to escape to [[Switzerland]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1131}}

====Colonies and dependencies====
[[File:Italian Colonial Empire (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Every territory ever controlled by the [[Italian Empire]] at some point in time during World War II]]

=====In Europe=====
The [[Dodecanese Islands]] were an Italian dependency from 1912 to 1943.

Montenegro was an Italian dependency from 1941 to 1943 known as the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Governorate of Montenegro]] that was under the control of an Italian military governor. Initially, the Italians intended that Montenegro would become an "independent" state closely allied with Italy, reinforced through the strong dynastic links between Italy and Montenegro, as [[Elena of Montenegro|Queen Elena of Italy]] was a daughter of the last Montenegrin king [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]]. The Italian-backed Montenegrin nationalist [[Sekula Drljević]] and his followers attempted to create a Montenegrin state. On 12 July 1941, they proclaimed the "Kingdom of Montenegro" under the protection of Italy. In less than 24 hours, that triggered a [[Uprising in Montenegro (1941)|general uprising against the Italians]]. Within three weeks, the insurgents managed to capture almost all the territory of Montenegro. Over 70,000 Italian troops and 20,000 of [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)|Albanian]] and [[Sandžak Muslim militia|Muslim]] irregulars were deployed to suppress the rebellion. Drljevic was expelled from Montenegro in October 1941. Montenegro then came under full direct Italian control. With the Italian capitulation of 1943, Montenegro came directly under the control of Germany.

[[Albanian Kingdom (1939–1943)|Albania]] was an Italian protectorate and dependency from 1939 to 1943. In spite of Albania's long-standing protection and alliance with Italy, on 7 April 1939 Italian troops [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded]] Albania, five months before the start of the Second World War. Following the invasion, Albania became a protectorate under Italy, with King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy being awarded the crown of Albania. An Italian governor controlled Albania.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/albania/30.htm Albania: A Country Study: Italian Occupation, Library of Congress]. Last accessed 14 Februari 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian troops under Italian control were sent to participate in the Italian invasion of Greece and the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Following Yugoslavia's defeat, Kosovo was annexed to Albania by the Italians.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"/&gt;

Politically and economically dominated by Italy from its creation in 1913, Albania was occupied by Italian military forces in 1939 as the Albanian king Zog l fled the country with his family. The Albanian parliament voted to offer the Albanian throne to the King of Italy, resulting in a personal union between the two countries.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/albania/28.htm|title=Albania - Italian Penetration|website=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albanian army, having been trained by Italian advisors, was reinforced by 100,000 Italian troops. A Fascist militia was organized, drawing its strength principally from Albanians of Italian descent.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Albania served as the staging area for the Italian invasions of Greece and Yugoslavia. Albania annexed Kosovo in 1941 when Yugoslavia was dissolved, creating a Greater Albania.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"/&gt;

Albanian troops were dispatched to the Eastern Front to fight the Soviets as part of the Italian Eighth Army.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Albania declared war on the United States in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vhcQIGWT71oJ:worldatwar.net/timeline/other/diplomacy39-45.html+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us. ''Timeline Data]; World at War online; retrieved 14 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Fascist regime of Italy fell, in September 1943 Albania fell under German occupation.

=====In Africa and Asia=====
[[Italian East Africa]] was an Italian colony existing from 1936 to 1943. Prior to the invasion and annexation of Ethiopia into this united colony in 1936, Italy had two colonies, Eritrea and Somalia since the 1880s.

[[Italian Libya|Libya]] was an Italian colony existing from 1912 to 1943. The northern portion of Libya was incorporated directly into Italy in 1939, however the region remained united as a colony under a colonial governor.

There was also a minor Italian concession territory in Tientsin, Republic of China.

====War justifications====
The Japanese government justified its actions by claiming that it was seeking to unite [[East Asia]] under Japanese leadership in a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] that would free East Asians from domination and rule by clients of Western powers.&lt;ref&gt;Barak Kushner. The Thought War: Japanese Imperial Propaganda. University of Hawaii Press, P. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan invoked themes of [[Pan-Asianism]] and said that the Asian people needed to be free from Western influence.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Conroy, Harry Wray. ''Pearl Harbor Reexamined: Prologue to the Pacific War''. University of Hawaii Press, 1990. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States opposed the Japanese war in China, and recognized Chiang Kai-Shek's [[Nationalist Government]] as the legitimate government of China. As a result, the United States sought to bring the Japanese war effort to a halt by imposing an embargo on all trade between the United States and Japan. Japan was dependent on the United States for 80 percent of its [[petroleum]], and as a consequence the embargo resulted in an economic and military crisis for Japan, as Japan could not continue its war effort against China without access to petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;Euan Graham. ''Japan's sea lane security, 1940–2004: a matter of life and death?'' Oxon, England; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2006. Pp. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain its military campaign in China with the major loss of petroleum trade with the United States, Japan saw the best means to secure an alternative source of petroleum in the petroleum-rich and natural-resources-rich [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Marston 2011"&gt;Daniel Marston. ''The Pacific War: From Pearl Harbor to Hiroshima''. Osprey Publishing, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This threat of retaliation by Japan to the total trade embargo by the United States was known by the American government, including American Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] who was negotiating with the Japanese to avoid a war, fearing that the total embargo would pre-empt a Japanese attack on the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Conroy, Harry Wray.

Japan identified the American Pacific fleet based in [[Pearl Harbor Naval Base|Pearl Harbor]] as the principal threat to its designs to invade and capture Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="Daniel Marston 2011"/&gt; Thus Japan initiated the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 as a means to inhibit an American response to the invasion of Southeast Asia, and buy time to allow Japan to consolidate itself with these resources to engage in a [[total war]] against the United States, and force the United States to accept Japan's acquisitions.&lt;ref name="Daniel Marston 2011"/&gt; On 7 December 1941 Japan [[Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire|declared war on the United States and the British Empire]].

====History====
The [[Empire of Japan]], a constitutional monarchy ruled by [[Hirohito]], was the principal Axis power in Asia and the Pacific. Under the emperor were a political cabinet and the [[Imperial General Headquarters]], with two chiefs of staff. By 1945 the Emperor of Japan was more than a symbolic leader; he played a major role in devising a strategy to keep himself on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'' (2001) ch 13&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak, Japan's [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] included [[Manchuria]], [[Inner Mongolia]], large parts of [[China]], [[Malaysia]], [[French Indochina]], [[Dutch East Indies]], [[The Philippines]], [[Burma]], a small part of India, and various Pacific Islands in the central Pacific.

As a result of the internal discord and economic downturn of the 1920s, militaristic elements set Japan on a path of expansionism. As the Japanese home islands lacked natural resources needed for growth, Japan planned to establish hegemony in Asia and become self-sufficient by acquiring territories with abundant natural resources. Japan's expansionist policies alienated it from other countries in the [[League of Nations]] and by the mid-1930s brought it closer to Germany and Italy, who had both pursued similar expansionist policies. Cooperation between Japan and Germany began with the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], in which the two countries agreed to ally to challenge any attack by the Soviet Union.

Japan entered into conflict [[Second Sino-Japanese War|against the Chinese]] in 1937. The Japanese invasion and occupation of parts of China resulted in numerous atrocities against civilians, such as the [[Nanking massacre]] and the [[Three Alls Policy]]. The Japanese also [[Soviet–Japanese border conflicts|fought skirmishes]] with Soviet–[[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolian]] forces in [[Manchukuo]] in 1938 and 1939. Japan sought to avoid war with the Soviet Union by signing a non-aggression pact with it in 1941.

Japan's military leaders were divided on diplomatic relationships with Germany and Italy and the attitude towards the United States. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] was in favour of war with the United States, but the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] was generally strongly opposed. When [[Prime Minister of Japan]] General [[Hideki Tojo]] refused American demands that Japan withdraw its military forces from China, a confrontation became more likely.{{sfn|Dull|2007|p=5}} War with the United States was being discussed within the Japanese government by 1940.{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275–276}} Commander of the Combined Fleet Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] was outspoken in his opposition, especially after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, saying on 14 October 1940: "To fight the United States is like fighting the whole world. But it has been decided. So I will fight the best I can. Doubtless I shall die on board {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} [his flagship]. Meanwhile Tokyo will be burnt to the ground three times. Konoe and others will be torn to pieces by the revengeful people, I [shouldn't] wonder. "{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275–276}} In October and November 1940, Yamamoto communicated with Navy Minister Oikawa, and stated, "Unlike the pre-Tripartite days, great determination is required to make certain that we avoid the danger of going to war. "{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275–276}}

With the European powers focused on the war in Europe, Japan sought to acquire their colonies. In 1940 Japan responded to the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]] by occupying [[French Indochina]]. The [[Vichy France]] regime, a ''de facto'' ally of Germany, accepted the takeover. The allied forces did not respond with war. However, the United States instituted an embargo against Japan in 1941 because of the continuing war in China. This cut off Japan's supply of scrap metal and oil needed for industry, trade, and the war effort.

To isolate the US forces stationed in the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]] and to reduce US naval power, the [[Imperial General Headquarters]] ordered [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|an attack]] on the US naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, on 7 December 1941. They also invaded [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. Initially achieving a series of victories, by 1943 the Japanese forces were driven back towards the home islands. The [[Pacific War]] lasted until the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945. The Soviets formally declared war in August 1945 and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|engaged Japanese forces]] in Manchuria and northeast China.

====Colonies and dependencies====
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indonesische jongens tijdens hun soldatentraining door de Japanners TMnr 10001989.jpg|thumb|Japanese officers training Indonesian recruits]]
Taiwan, then known as Formosa, was a Japanese dependency established in 1895.

Korea was a Japanese protectorate and dependency formally established by the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910]].

The [[South Pacific Mandate]] were territories granted to Japan in 1919 in the peace agreements of World War I, that designated to Japan the German South Pacific islands. Japan received these as a reward by the Allies of World War I, when Japan was then allied against Germany.

Japan occupied the [[Dutch East Indies]] during the war. Japan planned to transform these territories into a client state of [[Indonesia]] and sought alliance with Indonesian nationalists including future Indonesian President [[Sukarno]], however these efforts did not deliver the creation of an Indonesian state until after Japan's surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Li Narangoa, R. B. Cribb. ''Imperial Japan and National Identities in Asia, 1895-1945''. Psychology Press, 2003. P15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent signatories of the Tripartite Pact==
In addition to the 3 major Axis powers, 4 more countries and 2 puppet regimes signed the Tri-Partite Pact as its member states. Of the 4 countries, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria participated in various Axis military operations with their national armed forces, while the 4th, Yugoslavia, saw its pro-Nazi government overthrown in a coup merely days after it signed the Pact, and the membership was reversed.

The 2 puppet regimes that signed the Tri-Partite Pact, Tiso-led Slovakia and the Independent State of Croatia are listed among the client states section below.

===Bulgaria===
{{Main|Military history of Bulgaria during World War II}}
[[File:Bulgarian army 1941.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian soldiers in [[Vardar Macedonia]] during the Balkans campaign]]

The [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] was ruled by [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Тsar Boris III]] when it signed the Tripartite Pact on 1 March 1941. Bulgaria had been on the losing side in the First World War and sought a return of lost ethnically and historically Bulgarian territories, specifically in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]] (all within [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]] and [[Turkey]]). During the 1930s, because of traditional right-wing elements, Bulgaria drew closer to Nazi Germany. In 1940 Germany pressured Romania to sign the [[Treaty of Craiova]], returning to Bulgaria the region of [[Southern Dobrudja]], which it had lost in 1913. The Germans also promised Bulgaria — if it joined the Axis — an enlargement of its territory to the borders specified in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]].

Bulgaria participated in the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] and Greece by letting German troops attack from its territory and sent troops to Greece on April 20. As a reward, the Axis powers allowed Bulgaria to occupy parts of both countries—southern and south-eastern Yugoslavia ([[Vardar Banovina]]) and north-eastern Greece (parts of [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Greek Thrace]]). The Bulgarian forces in these areas spent the following years fighting various nationalist groups and [[resistance movement]]s. Despite German pressure, Bulgaria did not take part in the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]] and actually never declared war on the Soviet Union. The [[Bulgarian Navy]] was nonetheless involved in a number of skirmishes with the Soviet [[Black Sea Fleet]], which attacked Bulgarian shipping.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Bulgarian government declared war on the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. This action remained largely symbolic (at least from the Bulgarian perspective), until August 1943, when Bulgarian air defense and air force attacked Allied bombers, returning (heavily damaged) from a mission over the Romanian oil refineries. This turned into a disaster for the citizens of [[Sofia]] and other major Bulgarian cities, which were heavily bombed by the Allies in the winter of 1943–1944.

On 2 September 1944, as the [[Red Army]] approached the Bulgarian border, a new Bulgarian government came to power and sought peace with the Allies, expelled the few remaining German troops, and declared neutrality. These measures however did not prevent the Soviet Union from declaring war on Bulgaria on 5 September, and on 8 September the Red Army marched into the country, meeting no resistance. This was followed by the [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|coup d'état of 9 September 1944]], which brought a government of the pro-Soviet [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] to power. After this, the Bulgarian army (as part of the Red Army's [[3rd Ukrainian Front]]) fought the Germans in Yugoslavia and Hungary, sustaining numerous casualties. Despite this, the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] treated Bulgaria as one of the defeated countries. Bulgaria was allowed to keep [[Southern Dobruja]], but had to give up all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory.

===Hungary===
{{Main|Hungary during World War II|Government of National Unity (Hungary)}}
[[File:Toldi.jpg|thumb|Hungarian [[Toldi (tank)|Toldi I]] tank as used during the 1941 Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]][[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]], ruled by [[Regent]] Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]], was the first country apart from Germany, Italy, and Japan to adhere to the Tripartite Pact, signing the agreement on 20 November 1940. Slovakia had been a client state of Germany since 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Seamus Dunn, T.G. Fraser. Europe and Ethnicity: The First World War and Contemporary Ethnic Conflict. Routledge, 1996. P97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political instability plagued the country until Miklós Horthy, a Hungarian nobleman and [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian naval]] officer, became regent in 1920. The vast majority of the Hungarians desired to recover territories lost through the [[Trianon Treaty]]. The country drew closer to Germany and Italy largely because of a shared desire to revise the peace settlements made after World War I.{{sfn|Montgomery|2002|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} Many people sympathized with the [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] policy of the Nazi regime. Due to its supportive stance towards Germany and the new efforts in the international policy, Hungary gained favourable territorial settlements by the [[First Vienna Award]], after the breakup of [[Czechoslovakia]] occupied and annexed the remainder of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] and in 1940 received [[Northern Transylvania]] from Romania via the [[Second Vienna Award]]. Hungarians permitted German troops to transit through their territory during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], and Hungarian forces took part in the invasion. Parts of Yugoslavia were annexed to Hungary; the United Kingdom immediately broke off diplomatic relations in response.

Although Hungary did not initially participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Hungary and the [[Soviet Union]] became belligerents on 27 June 1941. Over 500,000 soldiers served on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. All five of Hungary's field armies ultimately participated in the war against the Soviet Union; a significant contribution was made by the [[Hungarian Second Army]].[[File:Hungarian soldiers in the Carpathians.jpg|thumb|Hungarian soldiers in the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1944]]

On 25 November 1941, Hungary was one of thirteen signatories to the revived Anti-Comintern Pact. Hungarian troops, like their Axis counterparts, were involved in numerous actions against the Soviets. By the end of 1943, the Soviets had gained the upper hand and the Germans were retreating. The Hungarian Second Army was destroyed in fighting on the [[Voronezh Front]], on the banks of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. In 1944, with Soviet troops advancing toward Hungary, Horthy attempted to reach an armistice with the Allies. However, the Germans [[Operation Panzerfaust|replaced the existing regime with a new one]]. After fierce fighting, Budapest was taken by the Soviets. A number of pro-German Hungarians retreated to Italy and Germany, where they fought until the end of the war.

Relations between Germany and the regency of [[Miklós Horthy]] collapsed in 1944 when Horthy attempted to negotiate a peace agreement with the Soviets and jump out of the war without German approval. Horthy was forced to abdicate after German commandos, led by Colonel [[Otto Skorzeny]], held his son hostage as part of [[Operation Panzerfaust]].

Hungary was reorganized following Horthy's abdication in December 1944 into a totalitarian fascist regime called the [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]], led by [[Ferenc Szálasi]]. He had been Prime Minister of Hungary since October 1944 and was leader of the anti-Semitic fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]]. In power, his government was a puppet regime with little authority, and the country was effectively under German control. Days after the Szálasi government took power, the capital of [[Budapest]] was surrounded by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. German and Hungarian fascist forces tried to hold off the Soviet advance but failed. In March 1945, Szálasi fled to Germany as the leader of a government in exile, until the surrender of Germany in May 1945.

[[File:IAR80.jpg|thumb|right|A formation of Romanian [[IAR80]] fighter aircraft]]

When war erupted in Europe in 1939, the [[Kingdom of Romania]] was pro-British and allied to the [[Polish-Romanian alliance|Poles]]. Following the [[invasion of Poland]] by Germany and the Soviet Union, and the German conquest of France and the [[Low Countries]], Romania found itself increasingly isolated; meanwhile, pro-German and pro-Fascist elements began to grow.

The August 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol ceding [[Bessarabia]], and [[Northern Bukovina]] to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} On June 28, 1940, the Soviet Union [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied and annexed Bessarabia, as well as part of northern Romania]] and the [[Hertza region]].{{sfn|Senn|2007|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} On 30 August 1940, as a result of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-[[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] arbitrated [[Second Vienna Award]] Romania had to cede [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary. [[Southern Dobruja]] was ceded to [[Bulgaria]] in September 1940. In an effort to appease the Fascist elements within the country and obtain German protection, [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] appointed the General [[Ion Antonescu]] as Prime Minister on September 6, 1940.

Two days later, Antonescu forced the king to abdicate and installed the king's young son [[Michael of Romania|Michael]] (Mihai) on the throne, then declared himself ''Conducător'' ("Leader") with dictatorial powers. The [[National Legionary State]] was proclaimed on 14 September, with the [[Iron Guard]] ruling together with Antonescu as the sole legal political movement in Romania. Under King Michael I and the military government of Antonescu, Romania signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] on November 23, 1940. German troops entered the country on 10 October 1941, officially to train the Romanian Army. Hitler's directive to the troops on 10 October had stated that "it is necessary to avoid even the slightest semblance of military occupation of Romania".&lt;ref&gt;Dinu C. Giurescu, ''Romania in the Second World War (1939–1945)'', p.&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance of German troops in Romania determined Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] to launch an invasion of Greece, starting the [[Greco-Italian War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig Stockings]], Eleanor Hancock, ''Swastika over the Acropolis: Re-interpreting the Nazi Invasion of Greece in World War II'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Having secured Hitler's approval in January 1941, Antonescu [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|ousted the Iron Guard]] from power.

Romania was subsequently used as a platform for invasions of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Despite not being involved militarily in the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]], Romania requested that Hungarian troops not operate in the [[Banat (1941-1944)|Banat]]. Paulus thus modified the Hungarian plan and kept their troops west of the [[Tisza]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlile Aylmer Macartney, ''October Fifteenth: A History of Modern Hungary, 1929–1945, Volume 1'', p. 481&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arms industry in Romania#Weapons produced during World War II and the Interwar period|Romania's military industry]] was small but versatile, able to copy and produce thousands of French and Soviet mortars, hundreds of German [[3.7 cm Flak 18/36/37/43|37 mm anti-aircraft guns]], 200 British [[Vickers Model 1931]] 75&amp;nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns, hundreds of French 47&amp;nbsp;mm anti-tank guns, thousands of Czechoslovak machine guns and 126 French [[Renault UE Chenillette|Renault UE]] armored tractors. Original products include the [[Orița M1941]] sub-machinegun, the [[75 mm Reșița Model 1943]] anti-tank gun with a muzzle velocity of over 1&amp;nbsp;km/second of which up to 400 were made and about a hundred tank destroyers, the most notable being the [[Mareșal tank destroyer]], which is credited with being the inspiration for the German [[Hetzer]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Zaloga, ''Tanks of Hitler’s Eastern Allies 1941–45'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Romania also built sizable warships, such as the minelayer ''[[NMS Amiral Murgescu|Amiral Murgescu]]'' and the submarines ''[[NMS Marsuinul#Sister ship|Rechinul]]'' and ''[[NMS Marsuinul|Marsuinul]]''. Hundreds of originally-designed aircraft were also produced, such as the fighter [[IAR-80]] and the light bomber [[IAR-37]]. Romania had also been a major power in the oil industry since the 1800s. It was one of the largest producers in Europe and the Ploiești oil refineries provided about 30% of all Axis oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Rick|title=The Guns at Last Light|date=2013|publisher=Henry Holt|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-6290-8|page=354|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romania joined the German-led invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. Antonescu was the only foreign leader Hitler consulted on military matters&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Deletant, ''Final report'', p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; and the two would meet no less than ten times throughout the war.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Kaplan, ''In Europe's Shadow: Two Cold Wars and a Thirty-Year Journey Through Romania and Beyond'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Romania re-captured Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina during [[Operation Munchen]] before conquering further Soviet territory and establishing the [[Transnistria Governorate]]. After the [[Siege of Odessa]], the city became the capital of the Governorate. Romanian troops [[Crimean Campaign|fought their way into the Crimea]] alongside German troops and contributed significantly to the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|Siege of Sevastopol]]. Later, Romanian mountain troops joined the German campaign in the Caucasus, reaching as far as [[Nalchik]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David T. Zabecki]], ''World War II in Europe: An Encyclopedia'', p. 1421&lt;/ref&gt; After suffering devastating losses [[Romanian armies in the battle of Stalingrad|at Stalingrad]], Romanian officials began secretly negotiating peace conditions with the Allies. By 1943, the tide began to turn. The Soviets pushed further west, retaking Ukraine and eventually launching an [[First Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|unsuccessful invasion]] of eastern Romania in the spring of 1944. Romanian troops in the Crimea [[Kerch-Eltigen Operation|helped repulse initial Soviet landings]], but eventually all of the peninsula was re-conquered by Soviet forces and the [[Romanian Navy]] evacuated over 100,000 German and Romanian troops, an achievement which earned Romanian Admiral Horia Macellariu the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer C. Tucker, ''World War II at Sea: An Encyclopedia'', p. 633&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Jassy-Kishinev Offensive]] of August 1944, Romania [[King Michael's Coup|switched sides]] on August 23, 1944. Romanian troops then fought alongside the Soviet Army until the end of the war, reaching as far as Czechoslovakia and Austria.

The British historian Dennis Deletant has asserted that, Romania's crucial contributions to the Axis war effort, including having the third largest Axis army in Europe and sustaining the German war effort through oil and other materiel, meant that it was "on a par with Italy as a principal ally of Germany and not in the category of a minor Axis satellite".&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Deletant, "Romania", in [https://books.google.ro/books?id=VMk-DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=romania+minor+Axis+satellite&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmsdLR963cAhUBfFAKHa1qBOoQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=romania%20minor%20Axis%20satellite&amp;f=false David Stahel, ''Joining Hitler's Crusade'' (Cambridge University Press, 2017), p. 78]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yugoslavia (two day membership)===
{{main|Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|Yugoslav coup d'état|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}

Yugoslavia was largely surrounded by members of the pact and now bordered the German Reich. From late 1940 Hitler sought a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia. In February 1941, Hitler called for Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact, the Yugoslav delayed.  In March, divisions of the German army arrived at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border and permission was sought for them to pass through to attack Greece. On 25 March 1941, fearing that Yugoslavia would be invaded otherwise, the Yugoslav government signed the Tripartite Pact with significant reservations. Unlike other Axis powers, Yugoslavia was not obliged to provide military assistance, nor to provide its territory for Axis to move military forces during the war. Less than two days later, after demonstrations in the streets of Belgrade, Prince Paul and the government were removed from office by a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]]. Seventeen-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]] was declared to be of age. The new Yugoslav government under General [[Dušan Simović]], refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, and started negotiations with Great Britain and Soviet Union. Winston Churchill commented that "Yugoslavia has found its soul"; however, Hitler invaded and quickly took control.

==Co-belligerent state combatants==
Various countries fought side by side with the Axis powers for a common cause. These countries were not signatories of the Tripartite Pact and thus not formal members of the Axis.

===Finland===
{{Main|Military history of Finland during World War II}}

Although Finland never signed the Tripartite Pact and legally ''(de jure)'' was not a part of the Axis, it was Axis-aligned in its fight against the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=134}} Finland signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact of November 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Kent Forster, "Finland's Foreign Policy 1940-1941: An Ongoing Historiographic Controversy," ''Scandinavian Studies'' (1979) 51#2 pp 109-123&lt;/ref&gt;

The August 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol dividing much of eastern Europe and assigning Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence.{{sfn|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939}}{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=120}} After unsuccessfully attempting to force territorial and other concessions on the Finns, the Soviet Union tried to invade Finland in November 1939 during the [[Winter War]], intending to establish a communist puppet government in Finland.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|pp=120–121}}{{sfn|Kennedy-Pipe|1995|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} The conflict threatened Germany's iron-ore supplies and offered the prospect of Allied interference in the region.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=123}} Despite Finnish resistance, a peace treaty was signed in March 1940, wherein Finland ceded some key territory to the Soviet Union, including the [[Karelian Isthmus]], containing Finland's second-largest city, [[Viipuri]], and the critical defensive structure of the [[Mannerheim Line]]. After this war, Finland sought protection and support from the United Kingdom{{sfn|Seppinen|1983|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}&lt;ref name="FOFinland"&gt;British Foreign Office Archive, 371/24809/461-556.&lt;/ref&gt; and non-aligned Sweden,{{sfn|Jokipii|1987|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} but was thwarted by Soviet and German actions. This resulted in Finland being drawn closer to Germany, first with the intent of enlisting German support as a counterweight to thwart continuing Soviet pressure, and later to help regain lost territories.

In the opening days of Operation Barbarossa, Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Finland permitted German planes returning from mine dropping runs over [[Kronstadt]] and [[Neva River]] to refuel at Finnish airfields before returning to bases in [[East Prussia]]. In retaliation, the Soviet Union launched a major air offensive against Finnish airfields and towns, which resulted in a Finnish declaration of war against the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941. The Finnish conflict with the Soviet Union is generally referred to as the [[Continuation War]].

[[File:Hitler Mannerheim 2.jpg|upright|thumb| [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Mannerheim]] with Hitler]]
Finland's main objective was to regain territory lost to the Soviet Union in the Winter War. However, on 10 July 1941, Field Marshal [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] issued an [[Order of the Day]] that contained a formulation understood internationally as a Finnish territorial interest in Russian [[Karelia]].

Diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Finland were severed on 1 August 1941, after the British bombed German forces in the Finnish village and port of [[Pechenga (urban-type settlement), Murmansk Oblast|Petsamo]]. The United Kingdom repeatedly called on Finland to cease its offensive against the Soviet Union, and declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941, although no other military operations followed. War was never declared between Finland and the United States, though relations were severed between the two countries in 1944 as a result of the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]].
[[File:Tali-Ihantala.jpg|left|thumb|Finnish troops passing by the remains of a destroyed Soviet T-34 at the [[battle of Tali-Ihantala]]]]
Finland maintained command of its armed forces and pursued war objectives independently of Germany. Germans and Finns did work closely together during [[Operation Silverfox]], a joint offensive against Murmansk. Finland refused German requests to participate actively in the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and also granted asylum to Jews, while Jewish soldiers continued to serve in its army.

The relationship between Finland and Germany more closely resembled an alliance during the six weeks of the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement, which was presented as a German condition for help with munitions and air support, as the [[Fourth strategic offensive|Soviet offensive coordinated with D-Day]] threatened Finland with complete occupation. The agreement, signed by President [[Risto Ryti]] but never ratified by the Finnish Parliament, bound Finland not to seek a separate peace.

After Soviet offensives were fought to a standstill, Ryti's successor as president, Marshall Mannerheim, dismissed the agreement and opened secret negotiations with the Soviets, which resulted in a ceasefire on 4 September and the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944. Under the terms of the armistice, Finland was obliged to expel German troops from Finnish territory, which resulted in the [[Lapland War]]. Finland signed a [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|peace treaty]] with the Allied powers in 1947.

===Free City of Danzig===
{{Main|Free City of Danzig}}
The [[Free City of Danzig]], a semi-autonomous city-state under League of Nations protection, briefly aided the Nazis at the beginning of the [[invasion of Poland]], attacking Polish territories bordering the city. The [[Free City of Danzig Police]] and militia fought with German soldiers during the [[Battle of Westerplatte]] and the [[Defence of the Polish Post Office in Danzig|attack on the Polish post office in Danzig]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutscheundpolen.de/ereignisse/ereignis_jsp/key=polnische_post_1939.html Danzig: Der Kampf um die polnische Post] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the Polish campaign, Danzig was annexed into Germany.

===Iraq===
{{Main|Anglo-Iraqi War}}
[[File:Destroyed iraqi artillery.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] officer investigates wrecked Iraqi artillery near [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]].]]
The [[Kingdom of Iraq]] was briefly an ally of the Axis, fighting the United Kingdom in the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] of May 1941.

Anti-British sentiments were widespread in Iraq prior to 1941. Seizing power on 1 April 1941, the nationalist government of [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Rashid Ali]] repudiated the [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1930)|Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930]] and demanded that the British abandon their military bases and withdraw from the country. Ali sought support from Germany and Italy in expelling British forces from Iraq.

On 9 May 1941, [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], the [[Mufti]] of [[Jerusalem]] and associate of Ali, declared holy war{{sfn|Jabārah|1985|p=183}} against the British and called on Arabs throughout the Middle East to rise up against British rule. On 25 May 1941, the Germans stepped up offensive operations in the Middle East.

Hitler issued [[Führer Directive No. 30|Order 30]]: "The Arab Freedom Movement in the Middle East is our natural ally against England. In this connection special importance is attached to the liberation of Iraq&amp;nbsp;... I have therefore decided to move forward in the Middle East by supporting Iraq. "&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston (1950). The Second World War, Volume III, The Grand Alliance. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, p.234; [[Franz Kurowski|Kurowski, Franz]] (2005).

Hostilities between the Iraqi and British forces began on 2 May 1941, with heavy fighting at [[RAF Habbaniya|the RAF air base]] in [[Habbaniyah]]. The Germans and Italians dispatched aircraft and aircrew to Iraq utilizing Vichy French bases in Syria, which would later invoke fighting between [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Allied and Vichy French forces in Syria]].

The Germans planned to coordinate a combined German-Italian offensive against the British in Egypt, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and Iraq. Iraqi military resistance ended by 31 May 1941. Rashid Ali and the Mufti of Jerusalem fled to Iran, then Turkey, Italy, and finally Germany, where Ali was welcomed by Hitler as head of the Iraqi [[government-in-exile]] in Berlin. In propaganda broadcasts from Berlin, the Mufti continued to call on Arabs to rise up against the British and aid German and Italian forces. He also helped recruit [[Muslim]] volunteers in the Balkans for the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''.

===Thailand===
{{See also|Thailand in World War II}}
[[File:Plaek Pibulsonggram said Chulalongkorn university student on 8 October 1940.jpg|thumb|right|[[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] gave [[ultranationalist]] speech to the crowds at the [[Grand Palace]] in 1940.]]

[[Thailand]] waged the [[Franco-Thai War]] in October 1940 to May 1941 to reclaim territory from [[French Indochina]]. It became a formal ally of Japan from 25 January 1942. Japanese forces [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|invaded Thailand's territory]] an hour and a half before the attack on Pearl Harbor (because of the International Dateline, the local time was on the morning of 8 December 1941). Only hours after the invasion, Prime Minister Field Marshal [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Phibunsongkhram]] ordered the cessation of resistance against the Japanese. On 21 December 1941, a military alliance with Japan was signed and on 25 January 1942, [[Sang Phathanothai]] read over the radio Thailand's formal declaration of war on the United Kingdom and the United States. The Thai ambassador to the United States, [[Mom Rajawongse]] [[Seni Pramoj]], did not deliver his copy of the declaration of war. Therefore, although the British reciprocated by declaring war on Thailand and considered it a hostile country, the United States did not.

The Thais and Japanese agreed that [[Shan State]] and [[Kayah State]] were to be under Thai control. The rest of Burma was to be under Japanese control. On 10 May 1942, the Thai [[Phayap Army]] entered Burma's eastern Shan State, which had been claimed by Siamese kingdoms. Three Thai infantry and one cavalry division, spearheaded by armoured reconnaissance groups and supported by the air force, engaged the retreating Chinese 93rd Division. [[Kengtung]], the main objective, was captured on 27 May. Renewed offensives in June and November saw the Chinese retreat into [[Yunnan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027105102/http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |archivedate=2009-10-27|url=http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |title=Thailand and the Second World War }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area containing the Shan States and Kayah State was annexed by Thailand in 1942. The areas were ceded back to [[Burma]] in 1945.

The [[Free Thai Movement]] ("Seri Thai") was established during these first few months. Parallel Free Thai organizations were also established in the United Kingdom. Queen [[Rambai Barni]] was the nominal head of the British-based organization, and [[Pridi Banomyong]], the regent, headed its largest contingent, which was operating within Thailand. Aided by elements of the military, secret airfields and training camps were established, while [[Office of Strategic Services]] and [[Force 136]] agents slipped in and out of the country.

As the war dragged on, the Thai population came to resent the Japanese presence. In June 1944, Phibun was overthrown in a coup d'état. The new civilian government under [[Khuang Aphaiwong]] attempted to aid the resistance while maintaining cordial relations with the Japanese. After the war, U. S. influence prevented Thailand from being treated as an Axis country, but the British demanded three million tons of rice as reparations and the return of areas annexed from [[British Malaya|Malaya]] during the war. Thailand also returned the portions of British Burma and French Indochina that had been annexed. Phibun and a number of his associates were put on trial on charges of having committed war crimes and of collaborating with the Axis powers. However, the charges were dropped due to intense public pressure. Public opinion was favorable to Phibun, as he was thought to have done his best to protect Thai interests.

&lt;!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. --&gt;
The collaborationist administrations of German-occupied countries in Europe had varying degrees of autonomy, and not all of them qualified as fully recognized [[sovereign state]]s. The [[General Government]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied Poland]] was a German administration, not a Polish government. In [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied Norway]], the [[Quisling regime|National Government]] headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]] – whose name [[Quisling|came to symbolize pro-Axis collaboration]] in several languages – was subordinate to the [[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]]. It was never allowed to have any armed forces, be a recognized military partner, or have autonomy of any kind. In [[History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)|the occupied Netherlands]], [[Anton Mussert]] was given the symbolic title of "Führer of the Netherlands' people". His [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|National Socialist Movement]] formed a cabinet assisting the German administration, but was never recognized as a real Dutch government. The following list of German client states includes only those entities that were officially considered to be independent countries allied with Germany. They were under varying degrees of German influence and control, but were not ruled directly by Germans.

====Albania (under German control)====
{{Main|Albanian Kingdom (1943–1944)}}
After the Italian armistice, a vacuum of power opened up in [[Albania under Italy|Albania]]. The Italian occupying forces were rendered largely powerless, as the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement]] took control of the south and the National Front ([[Balli Kombëtar]]) took control of the north. Albanians in the Italian army joined the guerrilla forces. In September 1943 the guerrillas moved to take the capital of [[Tirana]], but German paratroopers dropped into the city. Soon after the battle, the German High Command announced that they would recognize the independence of a [[greater Albania]]. They organized an Albanian government, police, and military in collaboration with the Balli Kombëtar. The Germans did not exert heavy control over Albania's administration, but instead attempted to gain popular appeal by giving their political partners what they wanted. Several Balli Kombëtar leaders held positions in the regime. The joint forces incorporated Kosovo, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, and Presevo into the Albanian state. A High Council of Regency was created to carry out the functions of a head of state, while the government was headed mainly by Albanian conservative politicians. Albania was the only European country occupied by the Axis powers that ended World War II with a larger Jewish population than before the war.{{sfn|Sarner|1997|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} The Albanian government had refused to hand over their Jewish population. They provided Jewish families with forged documents and helped them disperse in the Albanian population.&lt;ref name="Yad Vashem: Albania"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205725.pdf| title=Shoah Research Center – Albania|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Albania was completely liberated on November 29, 1944.

====Serbia (Nedic Regime Puppet Government under German control)====
{{Main|Axis occupation of Serbia|Government of National Salvation}}
The [[Government of National Salvation]], also referred to as the Nedić regime, was the second Serbian puppet government, after the [[Commissioner Government]], established on the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|Territory of the (German) Military Commander in Serbia]]{{#tag:ref|Official name of the occupied territory translated from {{lang-de|Gebiet des Militärbefehlshaber Serbiens}}.&lt;ref name="Hehn"&gt;[[#Hehn_1971|Hehn (1971)]], pp. 344-73&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} during [[World War II]]. It was appointed by the German Military Commander in Serbia and operated from 29 August 1941 to October 1944. The Serbian puppet state enjoyed significant support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=David Bruce|title=Balkan holocausts?: Serbian and Croatian victim-centred propaganda and the war in Yugoslavia|date=2002|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0719064678|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister throughout was General [[Milan Nedić]]. The Government of National Salvation was evacuated from Belgrade to [[Kitzbühel]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in the first week of October 1944 before the German withdrawal from Serbia was complete.

Racial laws were introduced in all occupied territories with immediate effects on Jews and Roma people, as well as causing the imprisonment of those opposed to Nazism. Several concentration camps were formed in Serbia and at the 1942 Anti-Freemason Exhibition in Belgrade the city was pronounced to be free of Jews (Judenfrei). On 1 April 1942, a Serbian Gestapo was formed. An estimated 120,000 people were interned in German-run concentration camps in Nedić's Serbia between 1941 and 1944. 50,000 to 80,000 were killed during this period. Serbia became the second country in Europe, following Estonia, to be proclaimed Judenfrei (free of Jews). Approximately 14,500 Serbian Jews – 90 percent of Serbia's Jewish population of 16,000 – were murdered in World War II.

Collaborationist armed formations forces were involved, either directly or indirectly, in the mass killings of Jews, Roma and those Serbs who sided with any anti-German resistance or were suspects of being a member of such. These forces were also responsible for the killings of many Croats and Muslims; however, some Croats who took refuge in Nedić's Serbia were not discriminated against. After the war, the Serbian involvement in many of these events and the issue of Serbian collaboration were subject to historical revisionism by later public figures.

Nedić himself was captured by the Americans when they occupied the former territory of Austria, and was subsequently handed over to the Yugoslav communist authorities to act as a witness against war criminals, on the understanding he would be returned to American custody to face trial by the Allies. The Yugoslav authorities refused to return Nedić to United States custody. He died on 4 February 1946 after either jumping or falling out of the window of a Belgrade hospital, under circumstances which remain unclear.

====Italy (Italian Social Republic)====
{{Main|Italian Social Republic}}
[[File:Italian social republic map.png|thumb|Italian Social Republic]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-311-0926-07, Italien, italienische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|left|RSI ([[Italian Social Republic|Repubblica Sociale Italiana]]) soldiers, March 1944]]

Italian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]] formed the Italian Social Republic (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) on 23 September 1943, succeeding the Kingdom of Italy as a member of the Axis.

Mussolini had been removed from office and arrested by King Victor Emmanuel III on 25 July 1943. After the Italian armistice, in a [[Gran Sasso raid|raid]] led by German paratrooper [[Otto Skorzeny]], Mussolini was rescued from arrest.

Once restored to power, Mussolini declared that Italy was a [[republic]] and that he was the new head of state. He was subject to German control for the duration of the war.

====Slovakia (Tiso regime)====
{{Main|Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak invasion of Poland}}
[[File:Slovakia1941 02.png|thumb|Slovakia in 1941]]
The [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak Republic]] under President [[Josef Tiso]] signed the Tripartite Pact on 24 November 1940.

Slovakia had been closely aligned with Germany almost immediately from its declaration of independence from Czechoslovakia on 14 March 1939. Slovakia entered into a treaty of protection with Germany on 23 March 1939.

Slovak troops joined the German invasion of Poland, having interest in [[Spiš]] and [[Orava (region)|Orava]]. Those two regions, along with [[Cieszyn Silesia]], had been [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts|disputed]] between Poland and Czechoslovakia since 1918. The Poles fully annexed them following the [[Munich Agreement]]. After the invasion of Poland, Slovakia reclaimed control of those territories.
[[File:Andrzeja Olejko Słowackie epizody z polskiego Podkarpacia Sanok 39.jpg|thumb|Slovak troops led by General [[Ferdinand Čatloš]] (center) pose with a statue of [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] in [[Sanok]] during the Invasion of Poland.]]
Slovakia invaded Poland alongside German forces, contributing 50,000 men at this stage of the war.

Slovakia declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941 and signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941. Slovak troops fought on Germany's Eastern Front, furnishing Germany with two divisions totaling 80,000 men. Slovakia declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in 1942.

Slovakia was spared German military occupation until the [[Slovak National Uprising]], which began on 29 August 1944, and was almost immediately crushed by the Waffen SS and Slovak troops loyal to Josef Tiso.

After the war, Tiso was executed and Slovakia once again became part of Czechoslovakia. The border with Poland was shifted back to the pre-war state. Slovakia and the Czech Republic finally separated into independent states in 1993.

===Italian===
&lt;!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. --&gt;
Italy occupied several nations and set up clients in those regions to carry out administrative tasks and maintain order.

====Monaco====
The [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] was officially neutral during the war. The population of the country was largely of Italian descent and sympathized with Italy. Its prince was a close friend of the Vichy French leader, Marshal Philippe Pétain, an Axis collaborator. A fascist regime was established under the nominal rule of the prince when the Italian Fourth Army occupied the country on November 10, 1942 as a part of [[Case Anton]]. Monaco's military forces, consisting primarily of police and palace guards, collaborated with the Italians during the occupation. German troops occupied Monaco in 1943, and Monaco was liberated by Allied forces in 1944.

====Croatia (Independent State of Croatia)====
{{Main|Independent State of Croatia}}
[[File:Adolf Hitler meets Ante Pavelić.1941.jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] meeting with NDH leader [[Ante Pavelić]].]]

On 10 April 1941, the Independent State of Croatia (''Nezavisna Država Hrvatska'', or NDH) declared itself a member of the Axis, co-signing the Tripartite Pact. The NDH remained a member of the Axis until the end of Second World War, its forces fighting for Germany even after its territory had been overrun by [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. On 16 April 1941, [[Ante Pavelić]], a Croatian nationalist and one of the founders of the [[Ustaše]] (''"Croatian Liberation Movement"''), was proclaimed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (leader) of the new regime.

Initially the Ustaše had been heavily influenced by Italy. They were actively supported by Mussolini's Fascist regime in Italy, which gave the movement training grounds to prepare for war against Yugoslavia, as well as accepting Pavelić as an exile and allowing him to reside in Rome. Italy intended to use the movement to destroy Yugoslavia, which would allow Italy to expand its power through the Adriatic. Hitler did not want to engage in a war in the Balkans until the Soviet Union was defeated. The Italian occupation of Greece was not going well; Mussolini wanted Germany to invade Yugoslavia to save the Italian forces in Greece. Hitler reluctantly agreed; Yugoslavia was invaded and the Independent State of Croatia was created. Pavelić led a delegation to Rome and offered the crown of Croatia to an Italian prince of the House of Savoy, who was crowned ''[[Tomislav II]], King of Croatia, Prince of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Voivode of Dalmatia, [[Tuzla]] and Knin, Prince of [[Cisterna]] and of Belriguardo, Marquess of [[Voghera]], and Count of [[Ponderano]].'' The next day, Pavelić signed the Contracts of Rome with Mussolini, ceding Dalmatia to Italy and fixing the permanent borders between the NDH and Italy. Italian armed forces were allowed to control all of the coastline of the NDH, effectively giving Italy total control of the Adriatic coastline.

However, strong German influence began to be asserted soon after the NDH was founded. When the King of Italy ousted Mussolini from power and Italy capitulated, the NDH became completely under German influence.

The platform of the Ustaše movement proclaimed that Croatians had been oppressed by the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and that Croatians deserved to have an independent nation after years of domination by foreign empires. The Ustaše perceived Serbs to be racially inferior to Croats and saw them as infiltrators who were occupying Croatian lands. They saw the extermination of Serbs as necessary to racially purify Croatia. While part of Yugoslavia, many Croatian nationalists violently opposed the Serb-dominated Yugoslav monarchy, and assassinated [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]], together with the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]]. The regime enjoyed support amongst radical Croatian nationalists. Ustashe forces fought against communist Yugoslav Partisan guerrilla throughout the war.

Upon coming to power, Pavelić formed the Croatian Home Guard (''Hrvatsko domobranstvo'') as the official military force of the NDH. Originally authorized at 16,000 men, it grew to a peak fighting force of 130,000. The Croatian Home Guard included an air force and navy, although its navy was restricted in size by the Contracts of Rome. In addition to the Croatian Home Guard, Pavelić was also the supreme commander of the [[Ustaše militia]], although all NDH military units were generally under the command of the German or Italian formations in their area of operations.

The Ustaše government declared war on the Soviet Union, signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941, and sent troops to Germany's Eastern Front. Ustaše militia were garrisoned in the Balkans, battling the communist partisans.

The Ustaše government applied racial laws on Serbs, Jews, [[Romani people]], as well as targeting those opposed to the fascist regime, and after June 1941 deported them to the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] or to German camps in Poland. The racial laws were enforced by the Ustaše militia. The exact number of victims of the Ustaše regime is uncertain due to the destruction of documents and varying numbers given by historians. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, between 320,000 and 340,000 Serbs were killed in the NDH.&lt;ref name="US Holocaust Memorial Museum"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030711191159/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005449 Jasenovac] United States Holocaust Memorial Museum web site&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece (Hellenic State)====
{{Main|Axis occupation of Greece|Hellenic State}}
[[File:Greece Prefectures 1941-44.png|thumb|Greece, 1941–1944]]
Following the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]] of Greece and the flight of the [[Greek government in exile|Greek government]] to Crete and then Egypt, the [[Hellenic State (1941-1944)|Hellenic State]] was formed in May 1941 as a puppet state of both Italy and Germany. Initially, Italy had wished to annex Greece, but was pressured by Germany to avoid civil unrest such as had occurred in Bulgarian-annexed areas. The result was Italy accepting the creation of a puppet regime with the support of Germany. Italy had been assured by Hitler of a primary role in Greece. Most of the country was held by Italian forces, but strategic locations ([[Central Macedonia]], the islands of the northeastern Aegean, most of [[Crete]], and parts of [[Attica]]) were held by the Germans, who seized most of the country's economic assets and effectively controlled the collaborationist government. The puppet regime never commanded any real authority, and did not gain the allegiance of the people. It was somewhat successful in preventing secessionist movements like the [[Vlach "Roman Legion"]] from establishing themselves. By mid-1943, the [[Greek Resistance]] had liberated large parts of the mountainous interior ("Free Greece"), setting up a separate administration there. After the Italian armistice, the Italian occupation zone was taken over by the German armed forces, who remained in charge of the country until their withdrawal in autumn 1944. In some Aegean islands, German garrisons were left behind, and surrendered only after the end of the war.

===Japanese===
&lt;!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. --&gt;
{{further|Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere}}
The Empire of Japan created a number of client states in the areas occupied by its military, beginning with the creation of Manchukuo in 1932. These puppet states achieved varying degrees of international recognition.

====Burma (Ba Maw regime)====
{{Main|Japanese occupation of Burma|State of Burma|Burma National Army}}
The Japanese Army and Burma nationalists, led by [[Aung San]], seized control of Burma from the United Kingdom during 1942. A [[State of Burma]] was formed on 1 August under the Burmese nationalist leader [[Ba Maw]]. The Ba Maw regime established the Burma Defence Army (later renamed the [[Burma National Army]]), which was commanded by [[Aung San]].

====Cambodia====
{{Main|Japanese occupation of Cambodia}}
The [[Colonial Cambodia#Emergence of Khmer nationalism|Kingdom of Cambodia]] was a short-lived Japanese puppet state that lasted from 9 March 1945 to 15 August 1945.

The Japanese entered Cambodia in mid-1941, but allowed Vichy French officials to remain in administrative posts. The Japanese calls for an "Asia for the Asiatics" won over many Cambodian nationalists.

This policy changed during the last months of the war. The Japanese wanted to gain local support, so they dissolved French colonial rule and pressured Cambodia to declare its independence within the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Four days later, King [[Norodom Sihanouk|Sihanouk]] declared Kampuchea (the original [[Khmer language|Khmer]] pronunciation of Cambodia) independent. Co-editor of the ''Nagaravatta'', [[Son Ngoc Thanh]], returned from Tokyo in May and was appointed foreign minister.

On the date of Japanese surrender, a new government was proclaimed with Son Ngoc Thanh as prime minister. When the Allies occupied [[Phnom Penh]] in October, Son Ngoc Thanh was arrested for collaborating with the Japanese and was exiled to France. Some of his supporters went to northwestern Cambodia, which had been under Thai control since the [[French-Thai War]] of 1940, where they banded together as one faction in the [[Khmer Issarak]] movement, originally formed with Thai encouragement in the 1940s.

====China (Reorganized National Government of China)====
{{Main|Wang Jingwei regime}}
During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Japan advanced from its bases in Manchuria to occupy much of East and Central China. Several Japanese puppet states were organized in areas occupied by the Japanese Army, including the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937–1940)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] at [[Beijing]], which was formed in 1937, and the [[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]] at Nanjing, which was formed in 1938. These governments were merged into the [[Reorganized National Government of China]] at Nanjing on 29 March 1940. [[Wang Jingwei]] became head of state. The government was to be run along the same lines as the Nationalist regime and adopted its symbols.

The Nanjing Government had no real power; its main role was to act as a propaganda tool for the Japanese. The Nanjing Government concluded agreements with Japan and Manchukuo, authorising Japanese occupation of China and recognising the independence of Manchukuo under Japanese protection. The Nanjing Government signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941 and declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom on 9 January 1943.

The government had a strained relationship with the Japanese from the beginning. Wang's insistence on his regime being the true Nationalist government of China and in replicating all the symbols of the [[Kuomintang]] led to frequent conflicts with the Japanese, the most prominent being the issue of the regime's flag, which was identical to that of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

The worsening situation for Japan from 1943 onwards meant that the Nanking Army was given a more substantial role in the defence of occupied China than the Japanese had initially envisaged. The army was almost continuously employed against the communist [[New Fourth Army]].

Wang Jingwei died on 10 November 1944, and was succeeded by his deputy, [[Chen Gongbo]]. Chen had little influence; the real power behind the regime was [[Zhou Fohai]], the mayor of Shanghai. Wang's death dispelled what little legitimacy the regime had. The state stuttered on for another year and continued the display and show of a fascist regime.

On 9 September 1945, following the defeat of Japan, the area was surrendered to General [[He Yingqin]], a nationalist general loyal to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. The Nanking Army generals quickly declared their alliance to the Generalissimo, and were subsequently ordered to resist Communist attempts to fill the vacuum left by the Japanese surrender. Chen Gongbo was tried and executed in 1946.

====India (Provisional Government of Free India)====
{{Main|Azad Hind Fauj|Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:INA Jubilation.jpg|thumb|[[Indian National Army]] soldiers in Asia]] --&gt;

The ''Arzi Hukumat-e-[[Azad Hind]]'', the Provisional Government of Free India was a state that was recognized by nine Axis governments. It was led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], an [[Indian nationalist]] who rejected [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]]'s nonviolent methods for achieving independence. The [[First INA]] faltered after its leadership objected to being a propaganda tool for Japanese war aims, and the role of [[I Kikan]]. It was revived by the [[Indian Independence League]] with Japanese support in 1942 after the ex-PoWs and Indian civilians in South-east Asia agreed to participate in the INA venture on the condition it was led by [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]. Bose declared India's independence on October 21, 1943. The Indian National Army was committed as a part of the [[U Go Offensive]]. It played a largely marginal role in the battle, and suffered serious casualties and had to withdraw with the rest of Japanese forces after the [[Battle of Imphal|siege of Imphal]] was broken. It was later committed to the defence of Burma [[Burma Campaign 1944–45|against the Allied offensive]]. It suffered a large number of desertions in this latter part. The remaining troops of the INA maintained order in Rangoon after the withdrawal of Ba Maw's government. although The provisional government was given nominal control of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] from November 1943 to August 1945.

====Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang)====
{{Main|Mengjiang}}
[[Mengjiang]] was a Japanese puppet state in [[Inner Mongolia]]. It was nominally ruled by Prince [[Demchugdongrub]], a [[Mongol]] nobleman descended from [[Genghis Khan]], but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military. Mengjiang's independence was proclaimed on 18 February 1936, following the Japanese occupation of the region.

The Inner Mongolians had several grievances against the central Chinese government in Nanking, including their policy of allowing unlimited migration of Han Chinese to the region. Several of the young princes of Inner Mongolia began to agitate for greater freedom from the central government, and it was through these men that Japanese saw their best chance of exploiting Pan-Mongol nationalism and eventually seizing control of Outer Mongolia from the Soviet Union.

Japan created Mengjiang to exploit tensions between ethnic Mongolians and the central government of China, which in theory ruled Inner Mongolia. When the various puppet governments of China were unified under the [[Wang Jingwei]] government in March 1940, Mengjiang retained its separate identity as an autonomous federation. Although under the firm control of the Japanese Imperial Army, which occupied its territory, Prince Demchugdongrub had his own independent army.

Mengjiang vanished in 1945 following Japan's defeat in World War II. As Soviet forces advanced into Inner Mongolia, they met limited resistance from small detachments of Mongolian cavalry, which, like the rest of the army, were quickly overwhelmed.

====Laos====
{{Main|French Protectorate of Laos#Japanese occupation of Laos}}
Fears of Thai irredentism led to the formation of the first Lao nationalist organization, the Movement for National Renovation, in January 1941. The group was led by Prince [[Phetsarath Rattanavongsa|Phetxarāt]] and supported by local French officials, though not by the Vichy authorities in [[Hanoi]]. This group wrote the current [[Pheng Xat Lao|Lao national anthem]] and designed the current [[Flag of Laos|Lao flag]], while paradoxically pledging support for France. The country declared its independence in 1945.

The liberation of France in 1944, bringing [[Charles de Gaulle]] to power, meant the end of the alliance between Japan and the Vichy French administration in Indochina. The Japanese had no intention of allowing the [[Gaullist]]s to take over, and in March 1945 they staged a military coup in Hanoi. Some French units fled over the mountains to Laos, pursued by the Japanese, who occupied [[Vientiane|Viang Chan]] in March 1945 and [[Luang Prabang|Luang Phrabāng]] in April. King [[Sisavang Vong|Sīsavāngvong]] was detained by the Japanese, but his son Crown Prince [[Savang Vatthana|Savāngvatthanā]] called on all [[Lao people|Lao]] to assist the French, and many Lao died fighting against the Japanese occupiers.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Prince Phetxarāt opposed this position. He thought that Lao independence could be gained by siding with the Japanese, who made him Prime Minister of Luang Phrabāng, though not of Laos as a whole. The country was in chaos, and Phetxarāt's government had no real authority. Another Lao group, the Lao Sēri (Free Lao), received unofficial support from the Free Thai movement in the [[Isan]] region.

Manchukuo, in the northeast region of China, had been a Japanese puppet state in [[Manchuria]] since the 1930s. It was nominally ruled by [[Puyi]], the last emperor of the [[Qing Dynasty]], but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military, in particular the [[Kwantung Army]]. While Manchukuo ostensibly was a state for ethnic [[Manchu people|Manchus]], the region had a [[Han Chinese]] majority.

Following the [[Mukden Incident|Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, the independence of Manchukuo was proclaimed on 18 February 1932, with Puyi as head of state. He was proclaimed the Emperor of Manchukuo a year later. The new Manchu nation was recognized by 23 of the [[League of Nations]]' 80 members. Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union were among the major powers who recognised Manchukuo. Other countries who recognized the State were the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Vatican City]]. Manchukuo was also recognised by the other Japanese allies and puppet states, including Mengjiang, the Burmese government of [[Ba Maw]], [[Thailand]], the Wang Jingwei regime, and the Indian government of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The League of Nations later declared in 1934 that Manchuria lawfully remained a part of China. This precipitated Japanese withdrawal from the League. The Manchukuoan state ceased to exist after the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] in 1945.

====Philippines (Second Republic)====
{{main|Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Second Philippine Republic}}
After the [[Battle of Bataan#The Fall of Bataan|surrender]] of the Filipino and American forces in [[Bataan Peninsula]] and [[Corregidor Island]], the Japanese established a puppet state in the Philippines in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillermo |first=Artemio R. |title=Historical Dictionary of the Philippines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmgX9M_yETIC&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=Support%20Second%20Republic%20Philippines&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q=Support%20Second%20Republic%20Philippines&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 March 2013 |year=2012 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7246-2 |pages=211, 621}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|Philippine National Assembly]] declared the Philippines an [[Second Philippine Republic|independent Republic]] and elected [[José P.

He was granted amnesty by President [[Manuel Roxas]], and remained active in politics, ultimately winning a seat in the post-war [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]].

====Vietnam (Empire of Vietnam)====
{{Main|Empire of Vietnam}}
The [[Empire of Vietnam]] was a short-lived Japanese puppet state that lasted from 11 March to 23 August 1945.

When the Japanese seized control of [[French Indochina]], they allowed Vichy French administrators to remain in nominal control. This French rule ended on 9 March 1945, when the Japanese officially took control of the government. Soon after, Emperor [[Bảo Đại]] voided the 1884 treaty with France and [[Trần Trọng Kim]], a historian, became prime minister.

The country suffered through the [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945]].

==Controversial cases==
{{See also|Foreign relations of the Axis powers}}

States listed in this section were not officially members of the Axis, but at some point during the war engaged in cooperation with one or more Axis members on level that makes their neutrality disputable.

===Denmark===
{{Main|Occupation of Denmark }}
[[File:Flag of Denmark.svg|thumb|[[Kingdom of Denmark]]]]

Denmark was occupied by Germany after April 1940 but never joined the Axis. On 31 May 1939, Denmark and Germany signed a treaty of non-aggression, which did not contain any military obligations for either party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalhistory.dk/Danish/Historien/1939_1945/IkkeAngrebsPagt.htm "Den Dansk-Tyske Ikke-Angrebstraktat af 1939"]. Flådens Historie. {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 9, Germany [[Operation Weserübung|attacked Scandinavia]], and the speed of the German invasion of Denmark prevented King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] and the Danish government from going into exile. They had to accept "protection by the Reich" and the stationing of German forces in exchange for nominal independence. Denmark coordinated its foreign policy with Germany, extending diplomatic recognition to Axis collaborator and puppet regimes, and breaking diplomatic relations with the Allied governments-in-exile. Denmark broke diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941.&lt;ref name="Trommer"&gt;{{cite web| author=Trommer, Aage | title="Denmark".

In 1941 Danish Nazis set up the ''[[Frikorps Danmark]]''. Thousands of volunteers fought and many died as part of the German Army on the Eastern Front. Denmark sold agricultural and industrial products to Germany and made loans for armaments and fortifications. The German presence in Denmark, including the construction of the Danish paid for part of the [[Atlantic Wall]] fortifications and was never reimbursed.

The Danish protectorate government lasted until 29 August 1943, when the cabinet resigned after the [[Danish Folketing election, 1943|regularly scheduled and largely free]] election concluding the [[Folketing]]'s current term. The Germans imposed [[martial law]], and Danish collaboration continued on an administrative level, with the Danish bureaucracy functioning under [[military occupation|German command]]. The [[Royal Danish Navy|Danish navy]] scuttled 32 of its larger ships; Germany seized 64 ships and later raised and refitted 15 of the sunken vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005449 |title=Jasenovac |date=11 July 2003 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030711191159/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005449 |archivedate=11 July 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navalhistory.dk/danish/Historien/1939_1945/dk_efter29august.htm |title=Flåden efter 29 August 1943 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816205702/http://navalhistory.dk/Danish/Historien/1939_1945/dk_efter29august.htm |archivedate=16 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 13 warships escaped to Sweden and formed a Danish naval flotilla in exile.

===Soviet Union===
{{See also|Germany–Soviet Union relations before 1941|German–Soviet Axis talks|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Soviet invasion of Poland}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-121-0011-20, Polen, deutsch-sowjetische Siegesparade.jpg|thumb|upright|German and Soviet soldiers during the official transfer of [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] to Soviet control in front of picture of Stalin, in the aftermath of the invasion and [[Partitions of Poland#"Fourth Partition"|partition of Poland]] by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939.]]

Relations between the Soviet Union and the major Axis powers were generally hostile before 1938. In the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Soviet Union gave military aid to the [[Second Spanish Republic]], against [[Spanish State|Spanish Nationalist]] forces, which were assisted by Germany and Italy. However, the Nationalist forces were victorious. The Soviets suffered another political defeat when their ally Czechoslovakia was partitioned and taken over by Germany in 1938–39. In 1938 and 1939, the USSR fought and defeated Japan in two separate border conflicts, at [[Battle of Lake Khasan|Lake Khasan]] and [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]]. The latter was a major Soviet victory that led the Japanese Army to avoid war with the Soviets and instead call for expansion south.

In 1939 the Soviet Union considered forming an alliance with either [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Britain and France]] or with Germany.{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=112–120}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=495–496}} When negotiations with Britain and France failed, they turned to Germany and signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. Germany was now freed from the risk of war with the Soviets, and was assured a supply of oil. This included a secret protocol whereby the independent countries of [[Poland]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Romania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] were divided into [[spheres of interest]] of the parties.{{sfn|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} The Soviet Union had been forced to cede the [[Kresy]] (Western [[Belarus]] and Western [[Ukraine]]) to Poland after losing the [[Soviet-Polish War]] of 1919–1921, and the Soviet Union sought to re-annex those territories.&lt;ref name="Eastern Europe 2004, Pp. 138-139"/&gt;

On 1 September, barely a week after the pact had been signed, [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]]. The Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded Poland from the east]] on 17 September and on 28 September signed a [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty|secret treaty]] with Nazi Germany to arrange coordination of fighting against Polish resistance. The Soviets targeted intelligence, entrepreneurs, and officers, committing a string of atrocities that culminated in the [[Katyn massacre]] and mass relocation to the [[Gulag]] in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/nazsov.asp|title=Avalon Project - Nazi-Soviet Relations 1939-1941|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon thereafter, the Soviet Union [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|occupied the Baltic countries]] of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania,{{sfn|Senn|2007|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}{{sfn|Wettig|2008|pp=20–21}} and annexed [[Bessarabia]] and [[Bukovina|Northern Bukovina]] from Romania. The Soviet Union attacked Finland on 30 November 1939, which started the [[Winter War]].{{sfn|Kennedy-Pipe|1995|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} Finnish defences prevented an all-out invasion, resulting in an [[Moscow Peace Treaty|interim peace]], but Finland was forced to cede strategically important border areas near [[Leningrad]].

The Soviet Union provided material support to Germany in the war effort against Western Europe through a pair of commercial agreements, [[German-Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|the first]] in 1939 and [[German-Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)|the second]] in 1940, which involved exports of raw materials ([[phosphates]], [[chromium]] and [[iron ore]], [[mineral oil]], grain, cotton, and rubber). These and other export goods transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories allowed Germany to circumvent the British naval blockade.

In October and November 1940, [[German–Soviet Axis talks|German-Soviet talks]] about the potential of joining the Axis took place in Berlin.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=58}}{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341–343}} [[Joseph Stalin]] later personally countered with a separate proposal in a letter on 25 November that contained several secret protocols, including that "the area south of [[Batum]] and [[Baku]] in the general direction of the [[Persian Gulf]] is recognized as the center of aspirations of the Soviet Union", referring to an area approximating present day Iraq and Iran, and a Soviet claim to Bulgaria.{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341–343}}{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–205}} Hitler never responded to Stalin's letter.{{sfn|Donaldson|Nogee|2005|pp=65–66}}{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=520–521}} Shortly thereafter, Hitler issued a secret directive on the invasion of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–205}}{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=59}}

Germany ended the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact by invading the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]] on 22 June 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} That resulted in the Soviet Union becoming one of the main members of [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]].

Germany then revived its Anti-Comintern Pact, enlisting many European and Asian countries in opposition to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and Japan remained neutral towards each other for most of the war by the [[Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact]]. The Soviet Union ended the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|by invading Manchukuo]] on 9 August 1945, due to agreements reached at the [[Yalta Conference]] with Roosevelt and Churchill.

[[Francisco Franco|''Caudillo'' Francisco Franco's]] [[Spain under Franco|Spanish State]] gave moral, economic, and military assistance to the Axis powers, while nominally maintaining neutrality. Franco described Spain as a member of the Axis and signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] in 1941 with Hitler and Mussolini. Members of the ruling [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]] party in Spain held irredentist designs on [[Gibraltar]].{{sfn|Wylie|2002|p=275}} Falangists also supported Spanish colonial acquisition of [[Tangier]], [[French Morocco]] and northwestern [[French Algeria]].{{sfn|Rohr|2007|p=99}} In addition, Spain held ambitions on former Spanish colonies in Latin America.{{sfn|Bowen|2000|p=59}} In June 1940 the Spanish government approached Germany to propose an alliance in exchange for Germany recognizing Spain's territorial aims: the annexation of the [[Oran]] province of [[Algeria]], the incorporation of all [[Morocco]], the extension of [[Spanish Sahara]] southward to the twentieth parallel, and the incorporation of [[French Cameroons]] into [[Spanish Guinea]].{{sfn|Payne|1987|p=269}} Spain invaded and occupied the [[Tangier]] International Zone, maintaining its occupation until 1945.{{sfn|Payne|1987|p=269}} The occupation caused a dispute between Britain and Spain in November 1940; Spain conceded to protect British rights in the area and promised not to fortify the area.{{sfn|Payne|1987|p=269}} The Spanish government secretly held expansionist plans towards Portugal that it made known to the German government. In a communiqué with Germany on 26 May 1942, Franco declared that Portugal should be annexed into Spain.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=857}}

Franco had previously won the [[Spanish Civil War]] with the help of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Both were eager to establish another fascist state in Europe. Spain owed Germany over $212 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reginbogin|first1=Herbert|title=Faces of Neutrality: A Comparative Analysis of the Neutrality of Switzerland and other Neutral Nations during WW II|date=2009|publisher=LIT Verlag|page=120|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; for supplies of [[matériel]] during the Spanish Civil War, and Italian combat troops had actually fought in Spain on the side of Franco's Nationalists.

From 1940 to 1941, Franco endorsed a Latin Bloc of Italy, Vichy France, Spain, and Portugal, with support from the Vatican in order to balance the countries' powers to that of Germany.&lt;ref name="John Lukacs"/&gt; Franco discussed the Latin Bloc alliance with Pétain of Vichy France in [[Montpellier]], France in 1940, and with Mussolini in [[Bordighera]], Italy.&lt;ref name="John Lukacs"/&gt;

When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Franco immediately offered to form a unit of military volunteers to join the invasion. This was accepted by Hitler and, within two weeks, there were more than enough volunteers to form a division – the [[Blue Division]] (''División Azul'') under General [[Agustín Muñoz Grandes]].

The possibility of Spanish intervention in World War II was of concern to the United States, which investigated the activities of Spain's ruling Falange party in Latin America, especially [[Puerto Rico]], where pro-Falange and pro-Franco sentiment was high, even amongst the ruling upper classes.{{sfn|Leonard|Bratzel|2007|p=96}} The Falangists promoted the idea of supporting Spain's former colonies in fighting against American domination.{{sfn|Bowen|2000|p=59}} Prior to the outbreak of war, support for Franco and the Falange was high in the Philippines.{{sfn|Steinberg|2000|p=122}} The [[Falange Exterior]], the international department of the Falange, collaborated with Japanese forces against U.S. and Filipino forces in the [[Philippines]] through the [[Philippine Falange]].{{sfn|Payne|1999|p=538}}

===Vichy France===
{{main|Vichy France}}
[[File:France map Lambert-93 with regions and departments-occupation.svg|thumb|France during the war; [[German occupation of France during World War II|Occupied and annexed zones by Germany]] in shades of red, [[Italian occupation of France during World War II|Italian occupation zones]] in shades of green, [[zone libre|"Free zone"]] in blue.]]

Although officially neutral, Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]]'s [[Vichy France|"Vichy regime"]] collaborated with the Axis from its creation on 10 July 1940. It retained full control of the [[zone libre|non-occupied part of France]] until November 1942 – when the whole of France was occupied by Germany – and of a large part of France's [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]], until the colonies gradually fell under [[Free French]] control.

The German invasion army entered Paris on 14 June 1940, following the [[battle of France]]. Pétain became the last Prime Minister of the [[French Third Republic]] on 16 June 1940. He sued for peace with Germany and on 22 June 1940, the French government [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)|concluded an armistice]] with Hitler. Under the terms of the agreement, Germany [[occupied France|occupied two-thirds]] of France, including Paris. Pétain was permitted to keep an "armistice army" of 100,000 men within the unoccupied southern zone. This number included neither the army based in the [[French colonial empire]] nor the French fleet. In Africa the Vichy regime was permitted to maintain 127,000.{{sfn|Bachelier|2000|p=98}} The French also maintained substantial garrisons at the French-mandated territory of [[Syrian Republic (1930-1958)|Syria]] and [[Greater Lebanon]], the French colony of [[French Madagascar|Madagascar]], and in [[French Somaliland]]. Some members of the Vichy government pushed for closer cooperation, but they were rebuffed by Pétain. Neither did Hitler accept that France could ever become a full military partner,{{sfn|Paxton|1993}} and constantly prevented the buildup of Vichy's military strength.

After the armistice, relations between the Vichy French and the British quickly worsened. Although the French had told Churchill they would not allow their fleet to be taken by the Germans, the British launched several naval attacks, the most notable of which was against [[Attack on Mers-el-Kébir|the Algerian harbour of Mers el-Kebir]] on 3 July 1940. Though Churchill defended his controversial decision to attack the French fleet, the action deteriorated greatly the relations between France and Britain. German propaganda trumpeted these attacks as an absolute betrayal of the French people by their former allies.

[[File:Flag of Philippe Pétain, Chief of State of Vichy France.svg|thumb|Personal flag of Philippe Pétain, Chief of State of [[Vichy France]].]]
On 10 July 1940, Pétain was given emergency "full powers" by a majority vote of the [[French National Assembly]]. The following day approval of the new constitution by the Assembly effectively created the [[French State]] (''l'État Français''), replacing the French Republic with the government unofficially called "Vichy France," after the resort town of [[Vichy]], where Pétain maintained his seat of government. This continued to be recognised as the lawful government of France by the neutral United States until 1942, while the United Kingdom had recognised [[Free France|de Gaulle's government-in-exile in London]]. Racial laws were introduced in France and its colonies and many [[History of the Jews in France|foreign Jews in France]] were deported to Germany. [[Albert Lebrun]], last President of the Republic, did not resign from the presidential office when he moved to [[Vizille]] on 10 July 1940. By 25 April 1945, during Pétain's trial, Lebrun argued that he thought he would be able to return to power after the fall of Germany, since he had not resigned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_archives/la_presidence/la_galerie_des_presidents/iii_eme_republique/albert_lebrun.21008.html Albert Lebrun's biography, French Republic Presidential official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414173559/http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_archives/la_presidence/la_galerie_des_presidents/iii_eme_republique/albert_lebrun.21008.html |date=April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1940, Vichy France [[invasion of French Indochina|was forced to allow Japan to occupy French Indochina]], a federation of French colonial possessions and protectorates encompassing modern day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The Vichy regime continued to administer them under Japanese military occupation. [[French Indochina]] was the base for the Japanese [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|invasions of Thailand]], [[Malayan Campaign|Malaya]], and [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]]. In 1945, [[geacps|under Japanese sponsorship]], the [[Empire of Vietnam]] and the [[Japanese occupation of Cambodia#Collaborationist Kingdom of Kampuchea|Kingdom of Kampuchea]] were proclaimed as Japanese puppet states.

On 26 September 1940, de Gaulle [[Battle of Dakar|led an attack by Allied forces on the Vichy port of Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]]. Forces loyal to Pétain fired on de Gaulle and repulsed the attack after two days of heavy fighting, drawing Vichy France closer to Germany.

During the [[Anglo–Iraqi War]] of May 1941, Vichy France allowed Germany and Italy to use air bases in the [[French mandate of Syria]] to support the Iraqi revolt. British and Free French forces attacked later [[Syria-Lebanon campaign|Syria and Lebanon in June–July 1941]], and in 1942 Allied forces [[Battle of Madagascar|took over French Madagascar]]. More and more colonies abandoned Vichy, joining the Free French territories of [[French Equatorial Africa]], [[French Polynesia|Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]] and others who had sided with de Gaulle [[Appeal of 18 June|from the start]].

In November 1942 Vichy French troops briefly resisted the [[Operation Torch|landing of Allied troops in French North Africa]] for a couple of days, until Admiral [[François Darlan]] negotiated a local ceasefire with the Allies. In response to the landings, [[Case Anton|Axis troops invaded]] the non-occupied zone in southern France and ended Vichy France as an entity with any kind of autonomy; it then became a puppet government for the occupied territories.

In June 1943, the formerly Vichy-loyal colonial authorities in [[French North Africa]] led by [[Henri Giraud]] came to an agreement with the [[Free French]] to merge with their own interim regime with the [[Free France#Creation of the French National Committee (CNF)|French National Committee]] (''Comité Français National'', CFN) to form a [[provisional government]] in [[Algiers]], known as the [[French Committee of National Liberation]] (''Comité Français de Libération Nationale'', CFLN) initially led by Darlan. After his assassination De Gaulle emerged as the uncontested French leader. The CFLN raised more troops and re-organised, re-trained and re-equipped the Free French military, in cooperation with Allied forces in preparation of future operations [[Operation Husky|against Italy]] and the [[Operation Overlord|German Atlantic wall]].

In 1943 the [[Milice]], a paramilitary force which had been founded by Vichy, was subordinated to the Germans and assisted them in rounding up opponents and Jews, as well as fighting the [[French Resistance]]. The Germans recruited volunteers in units independent of Vichy. Partly as a result of the great animosity of many right-wingers against the pre-war [[Front Populaire]], volunteers joined the German forces in their anti-communist crusade against the USSR. Almost 7,000 joined ''[[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism|Légion des Volontaires Français]]'' (LVF) from 1941 to 1944. The LVF then formed the cadre of the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|Waffen-SS Division ''Charlemagne'']] in 1944–1945, with a maximum strength of some 7,500. Both the LVF and the ''Division Charlemagne'' fought on the eastern front.

Deprived of any military assets, territory or resources, the members of the Vichy government continued to fulfil their role as German puppets, being quasi-prisoners in the so-called "[[Sigmaringen enclave]]" in a castle in Baden-Württemberg at the end of the war in May 1945.

===Germany's and Italy's declaration of war against the United States===
On 7 December 1941, Japan [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the US naval bases in Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii.  According to the stipulation of the [[Tripartite Pact]], Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were required to come to the defense of their allies only if they were attacked. Since Japan had made the first move, Germany and Italy were not obliged to aid her until the United States counterattacked. Nevertheless, expecting the US to declare war on Germany in any event,&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian.

The '''Barkly Tableland''' is  a rolling plain of [[grassland]] which runs from the eastern part of the Northern Territory into western [[Queensland]].&lt;ref name=qpn&gt;{{cite QPN|1654|Barkly Tableland|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the five regions in the [[Northern Territory]], [[Australia]] and covers 283,648&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,  21% of the Northern Territory. The Barkly Tableland runs parallel to the southern shore of the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], from about [[Mount Isa, Queensland]] to near [[Daly Waters]].

==History==
[[William Landsborough]] was the first non-Indigenous person to explore the tableland and named it after Sir [[Henry Barkly]], then governor of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

In 1877 the overlander, [[Nathaniel Buchanan]] and Sam Croker crossed the Barkly Tableland and rode on to the Overland Telegraph Line opening new land for settlement. It was not until the introduction of generous leasing arrangements on the Barkly in the late 1870s that the region became more settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, [[Captain Starlight|Harry Readford]], one of the inspirations for the literary character Captain Starlight, drove a mob of cattle to the Barkly and subsequently established [[Brunette Downs Station|Brunette Downs]] (then called Corella Creek), with outstations at [[Anthony Lagoon]] and Cresswell Creek, for Macdonald, Smith and Co. In 1884, 2,500 cattle were driven to Brunette Downs and in 1885, Readford brought in 1,200 mixed cattle from [[Burketown, Queensland|Burketown]]. Other stations in the area include [[Alexandria Station (Northern Territory)|Alexandria]], [[Mittiebah Station|Mittiebah]] and [[Walhallow Station|Walhallow]].

==Geography==

The Barkly Tableland rises to more than 300 metres (1,000 feet) near the Queensland and Northern Territory border. Black soil plains cover much of the Barkly Tableland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ga.gov.au/meta/ANZCW0703009510.html Surface geology of Australia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730121707/http://www.ga.gov.au/meta/ANZCW0703009510.html |date=July 30, 2008 }} Retrieved on 2 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Rainfall in this inland area is low (350mm pa) and subject to extreme seasonal fluctuations with rains occurring from November to March during the hot (up to 40&amp;nbsp;°C) summer. Winters are cool and frost may occur, especially in the southern section of the plain in Queensland.

The Barkly Tableland is a distinct physiographic province of the larger [[Australian Shield|West Australian Shield]] division. It includes the [[Mueller Plateau]] and [[Sandover-Pituri Platform]] physiographic sections between the desert uplands in the west and [[Mount Isa]], Queensland in the east. The Tableland drains into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] via the [[Flinders River]] while the southwestern plains drain into [[Lake Eyre]] via the [[Diamantina River]] or into the [[Simpson Desert]] via the [[Georgina River]] which has its source on the Tableland. Mount Isa meanwhile is drained by the [[Leichardt River]]. Waterways on the Tableland itself are small as most water drains into the porous limestone, sometimes forming salt lakes such as [[Lake Buchanan (Queensland)|Lake Buchanan]] in Queensland. [[Tarrabool Lake]], the largest wooded swamp in tropical Australia, when completely filled, is located in the west of the Tablelands. Other important water sources on the downs are the [[artesian spring]]s such as those of the [[Edgbaston Reserve]].

The Barkly region, with a population of just over 5,900 people, has the lowest population of any region in the Northern Territory. Most live in the main towns of [[Tennant Creek]] and [[Renner Springs, Northern Territory|Renner Springs]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nt.gov.au/business/services.cfm?cat5id=20 Barkly Tablelands Region]&lt;/ref&gt; Barkly has a diverse economy including agriculture, fishing, and defence but the main source of income is cattle ranching as the area includes some of the best beef [[cattle]] grazing country in Australia. 
[[File:Tablelands Highway.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Tablelands Highway]]]]
Some of the very large [[cattle station]]s located on the Tableland include [[Alexandria Station (Northern Territory)|Alexandria Station]], [[Alroy Downs]], [[Anthony Lagoon]], [[Austral Downs]], Avon Downs, [[Banka Banka Station|Banka Banka]], [[Brunette Downs Station|Brunette Downs]], Creswell Downs, Eva Downs, [[Helen Springs Station|Helen Springs]], [[Newcastle Waters Station|Newcastle Waters]] and [[Lake Nash Station]].

The region attracts more than 140,000 tourists average each year.

==Ecology==
The dominant flora of the Tableland is semi-arid [[savanna]] of [[Mitchell grass]] and the area forms most of the Mitchell Grass Downs [[ecoregion]] which covers an area running 1500&amp;nbsp;km from here southeast into the [[Channel Country]] of [[Queensland]]. To the south and west of these grasslands lies the central Australian desert. The grasslands are mostly used for cattle grazing and are home to some threatened species of plants and animals. The higher areas of Mount Isa and the [[Selwyn Range (Australia)|Selwyn Range]] have their own unique wildlife.

===Flora===
Mitchell grass is hardy with long roots so is well adapted to dry soils and periods of drought. The grasslands support other distinctive plants alongside the grasses but there are no areas of thick woodland, only [[acacia]] trees scattered across the plain.

===Fauna===
The habitat of the Mitchell Grass Downs is mostly a uniform cover of grassland and therefore does not support a great variety of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0707|name=Mitchell grass downs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few mammals include the [[common brushtail possum|brushtail possum]] (''Trichosurus vulpecula'') and the [[Alexandria false antechinus]] (''Pseudantechinus mimulus''), a small carnivorous marsupial found only in a number of small, isolated localities in northern Australia, including Alexandria Station on the Barkly Tableland. Meanwhile, the section of the Mitchell grasslands in Queensland is home to another endangered marsupial, the [[Julia Creek dunnart]].

There are healthy populations of grassland birds such as the [[flock bronzewing]], while the endangered [[night parrot]] has been spotted in [[Diamantina National Park]] in Queensland. The seasonal wetlands of the downs are important habitats, particularly as breeding grounds for waterbirds. These include the Lake Tarabool swamp, [[Lake Woods]], Lake Buchanan and [[Lake Galilee (Queensland)]].

There are also many snakes and other reptiles and amphibians adapted to the clay soils that crack in the long dry season and turn to mud after the rains. These include burrowing frogs that emerge to breed in the mud and the [[long-haired rat]] which erupts in huge numbers after the monsoon and spreads across the grasslands. Endemic reptiles of the downs include  the [[dwarf dtella]] [[gecko]] (''Gehyra minuta''), some species of [[Ctenotus]] and [[Lerista]] [[skink]]s, an [[Agamidae|agamid]] lizard (''[[Pogona henrylawsoni]]''), and a [[monitor lizard]] ([[Spencer's goanna]]). The snakes include the [[Elapidae]]; [[speckled brown snake]] (''[[Pseudonaja guttata]]''), [[Ingram's brown snake]] (''[[Pseudonaja ingrami]]''), and [[Collett's snake]], all of which are venomous. Insects include a number of endemic species of ant.

===Threats and preservation===
Some of the grassland is protected but most is pasture and although largely unspoilt, it is vulnerable to overgrazing, particularly areas of [[Queensland bluebush]] (''Chenopodium auricomum''). The downs are home to a number of endangered species and localised habitats that are threatened.

Protected areas that contain Mitchell grassland include [[Connells Lagoon National Park]] in the Northern Territory. In Queensland, [[Astrebla Downs National Park]], which is part of the national initiative to resuscitate the endangered [[bilby]] marsupial; [[Moorrinya National Park]] and [[Bladensburg National Park]], both home to the Julia Creek dunnart; [[Diamantina National Park]]; and [[White Mountains National Park]] which contains areas of desert uplands at the western edge of the tableland. The Mount Isa area is more or less unprotected except that part of it is in [[Boodjamulla National Park]].

[[File:BrigitteCelt.jpg|thumb|upright|A statuette in the Museum of Brittany, Rennes, probably depicting Brigid or Brigantia: c. 2nd century BCE]]
'''Brigit''', '''Brigid''' or '''Bríg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|dʒ|ɪ|d|,_|ˈ|b|r|iː|ɪ|d}}; meaning 'exalted one')&lt;ref name="campbell-delamarre"&gt;Campbell, Mike [http://www.behindthename.com/name/bridget Behind the Name.] See also Xavier Delamarre, ''brigantion / brigant-'', in ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003) pp. 87–88: "Le nom de la sainte irlandaise ''Brigit'' est un adjectif de forme *''brigenti''… 'l'Eminente'." Delamarre cites E. Campanile, in ''[[Indo-European languages|Langues indo-européennes]]'' ("The name of the Irish Saint Brigid is an adjective of the form *''brigenti''… 'the Eminent'"), edited by Françoise Bader (Paris, 1994), pp. 34–40, that Brigid is a continuation of the [[Indo-European religion|Indo-European goddess]] of the dawn like [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a goddess of [[Gaelic Ireland|pre-Christian Ireland]]. She appears in [[Irish mythology]] as a member of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], the daughter of [[the Dagda]] and wife of [[Bres]], with whom she had a son named Ruadán.

It has been suggested that Brigid is a continuation of the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] [[dawn goddess]].&lt;ref name="campbell-delamarre"/&gt; She is associated with the [[Spring (season)|spring]] season, fertility, healing, poetry and smithcraft. ''[[Sanas Cormaic|Cormac's Glossary]]'', written in the 10th century by Christian monks, says that Brigid was "the goddess whom poets adored" and that she had two sisters: Brigid the healer and Brigid the smith.&lt;ref&gt;Ó hÓgáin, Dáithí. ''Myth, Legend &amp; Romance: An encyclopaedia of the Irish folk tradition''. Prentice Hall Press, 1991. p.60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Brian. ''Brigid: Goddess, Druidess and Saint''. The History Press, 2011. pp.26-27&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests she may have been a [[triple deity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Sjoestedt | first=Marie-Louise | authorlink=Marie-Louise Sjoestedt | coauthors= | title=Celtic Gods and Heroes | date= | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | location= | isbn=0-486-41441-8 | pages=21, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brigit of Kildare|Saint Brigid]] shares many of the goddess's attributes and her feast day on the 1st February was originally a pagan festival ([[Imbolc]]) marking the beginning of spring. It has thus been argued that the saint is a Christianization of the goddess.&lt;ref name="The Goddess Obscured" /&gt;

==Familial relations==
She is identified in ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'' as a daughter of the [[Dagda]] and a poet. The same passage mentions that she has two oxen, Fe and Men, that graze on a plain named after them, Femen.  She also possessed the ''king of boars'', [[Twrch Trwyth|Torc Triath]], and Cirb, king of [[Domestic sheep|wethers]] (sheep), from whom Mag Cirb is named.&lt;ref&gt;Macalister, R. A. Stewart. ''Lebor Gabála Érenn''. Part IV. Irish Texts Society, Dublin, 1941. § VII, First Redaction, ¶ 317.&lt;/ref&gt; The animals were said to cry out a warning and thus Brigid is considered the guardian of domesticated animals.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Peter Berresford.  "Celtic Women."  Wm. B. Erdmans Publishing, Grand Rapids, MI, 1995, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the daughter of [[Dagda]], she is also the half sister of [[Cermait]], [[Aengus]], [[Midir]] and [[Bodb Derg]].

==Overview==
In ''[[Cath Maige Tuireadh]]'', Bríg invents [[:wiktionary:keening|keening]], a combination of weeping and singing, while mourning for her son Ruadán, after he is slain while fighting for the [[Fomorian]]s. She is credited in the same passage with inventing a whistle used for night travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/cmt/cmteng.htm ''Cath Maige Tuired''] (The Second Battle of Mag Tuired), translated by Elizabeth A. Gray. ¶ 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Brigid is considered the patroness of poetry, smithing, medicine, arts and crafts, cattle and other livestock, sacred wells, serpents (in Scotland) and the arrival of early spring.&lt;ref name="Carmina1"&gt;Carmichael, Alexander (1900) ''Carmina Gadelica: Hymns and Incantations, Ortha Nan Gaidheal, Volume I'', p.&amp;nbsp;169 [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/cg1/cg1074.htm The Sacred Texts Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Mary|title=Brigit|url=http://www.maryjones.us/jce/brigit.html|work=Jones' Celtic Encyclopedia|accessdate=14 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428023346/http://www.maryjones.us/jce/brigit.html#|archive-date=28 April 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Christian era, nineteen nuns at Kildare tended a perpetual flame for the Saint, which is widely believed to be a continuation of a pre-Christian practice of women tending a flame in her honour.&lt;ref name="CillDara"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Brigid: St Brigid's Fire|url=http://kildare.ie/local-history/kildare/saint-brigid.htm|publisher=Cill Dara Historical Society|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrensis1"/&gt; Her festival day, [[Imbolc]] is traditionally a time for weather prognostication:
{{verse translation|lang=gd|
Thig an nathair as an toll
Là donn Brìde,
Ged robh trì troighean dhen t-sneachd
Air leac an làir.
|
The serpent will come from the hole
On the brown Day of Bríde,
Though there should be three feet of snow
On the flat surface of the ground.&lt;ref name="Carmina1"/&gt;}}

In her English retellings of Irish myth, [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Augusta Gregory]] describes Brigit as "a woman of poetry, and poets worshipped her, for her sway was very great and very noble.  And she was a woman of healing along with that, and a woman of smith's work, and it was she first made the whistle for calling one to another through the night."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907958219|title=Gods and fighting men : the story of the Tuatha de Danaan and the Fiana of Ireland|last=Gregory|first=Isabella Augusta|date=1904|publisher=[publisher not identified]|others=Yeats, W. B.|year=1904|isbn=9781495385148|location=[Lexington, KY]|pages=24|oclc=907958219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible British and continental counterpart [[Brigantia (goddess)|Brigantia]]{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} seems to have been the Celtic equivalent of the Roman [[Minerva]] and the Greek [[Athena]] &lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica: Celtic Religion''&lt;/ref&gt; goddesses with very similar functions and apparently embodying the same concept of ''elevated state'', whether physical or psychological.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

She is the goddess of all things perceived to be of relatively high dimensions such as high-rising flames, highlands, hill-forts and upland areas; and of activities and states conceived as psychologically lofty and elevated, such as wisdom, excellence, perfection, high intelligence, poetic eloquence, craftsmanship (especially blacksmithing), healing ability, druidic knowledge and skill in warfare. In the living traditions, whether seen as goddess or saint, she is largely associated with the home and hearth and is a favorite of both [[Celtic Polytheism|Polytheists]] and [[Catholics]].  A number of these associations are attested in ''[[Cormac's Glossary]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Brigid and Saint Brigid==

In the [[Middle Ages]], the goddess Brigid was [[Syncretism|syncretized]] with the Christian saint of the same name. According to medievalist Pamela Berger, Christian "monks took the ancient figure of the mother goddess and grafted her name and functions onto her Christian counterpart," [[St. Brigid of Kildare]].&lt;ref name="The Goddess Obscured"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Goddess Obscured: Transformation of the Grain Protectress from Goddess to Saint |last1=Berger |first1=Pamela |year= 1985 |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |location=Boston |isbn=9780807067239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Brigid is associated with perpetual, sacred flames, such as the one maintained by 19 nuns at her sanctuary in [[Kildare]], Ireland. The sacred flame at Kildare was said by [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] and other chroniclers to have been surrounded by a hedge, which no man could cross. Men who attempted to cross the hedge were said to have been cursed to go insane, die or be crippled.&lt;ref name="CillDara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrensis1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cambrensis|first=Giraldus|title=The Topography of Ireland|url=http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/topography_ireland.pdf|publisher=[[York University]]|pages=54, 59|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of female priestesses tending sacred, naturally occurring ''eternal flames'' is a feature of ancient Indo-European pre-Christian spirituality. Other examples include the Roman goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], and other hearth-goddesses, such as [[Hestia]].

Both the goddess and saint are associated with holy wells, at Kildare and many other sites in the Celtic lands.  [[Well dressing]], the tying of [[clootie]]s to the trees next to [[Clootie well|healing wells]], and other methods of petitioning or honoring Brigid still take place in some of the Celtic lands and the diaspora.&lt;ref name="Healy"&gt;Healy, Elizabeth (2002) ''In Search of Ireland's Holy Wells''. Dublin, Wolfhound Press {{ISBN|0-86327-865-5}} pp. 12–19, 27, 56–7, 66, 69, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan"&gt;Logan, Patrick (1980) ''The Holy Wells of Ireland''. Buckinghamshire, Colin Smythe Limited. {{ISBN|0-86140-046-1}}. pp. 22–3, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
Saint Brigid's feast day is on 1 February celebrated as [[St Brigid's Day]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and by the [[Anglican Communion]]. The Gaelic festival coincides with [[Imbolc]], which is a pagan festival associated with the goddess Brigid.&lt;ref name="Koch2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John T. Koch|title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC|accessdate=14 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-1-85109-440-0|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neo-Pagan revival ==
Brigid is an important figure for [[Modern Paganism|modern pagans]], who emphasize her triple aspect. She is sometimes worshipped in conjunction with [[Cernunnos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46573490|title=Neo-pagan sacred art and altars : making things whole|last=Magliocco|first=Sabina|date=2001-01-28|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=2001|isbn=9781578063918|location=Jackson|pages=30|oclc=46573490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names and etymology==
[[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''Brigit'' {{IPA-sga|ˈbʲɾʲiʝidʲ|}} came to be spelled ''Briġid'' and ''Brighid'' {{IPA-sga|bʲɾʲiːdʲ|}} by the [[Irish language|modern Irish]] period. Since the spelling reform of 1948, this has been spelled ''Bríd'' {{IPA-ga|bʲɾʲiːdʲ|}}. The earlier form gave rise to various forms in the languages of Europe, starting from the Medieval Latin ''Brigit'' {{IPA|/ˈbriʒit/}}, suggested by the written form, and from there to various modern forms, such as English ''Bridget'' and ''Bridgit'' (now commonly seen as ''Brigid),'' French ''Brigitte,'' Swedish ''Birgitta,'' Italian ''Brigida'' and Finnish ''Piritta.''

The name is derived from Proto-Celtic ''*Brigantī'' and means "The High One", cognate with the name of the [[Celtic Britons|ancient British]] goddess [[Brigantia (goddess)]], the [[Old High German]] personal name ''Burgunt,'' and the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Bṛhatī'' (बृहती) "high", an epithet of the [[Hindu]] dawn goddess [[Ushas]]. The ultimate source is [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*bʰr̥ǵʰéntih₂'' (feminine form of ''*bʰérǵʰonts'', “high”), derived from the root ''*bʰerǵʰ-'' (“to rise”).&lt;ref&gt;Matasović, Ranko, Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic (Leiden Indo-European Etymological Dictionary Series no. 9), Brill, 2009, pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J. P. and Adams, Douglas Q. (eds.), Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

* Brìghde/Brìde ([[Scotland]])
* Ffraid ([[Wales]]) (also Braint, alt. Breint, the name of a river in Anglesey. Because of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[Welsh morphology|pronunciation mutations]] and accompanying devoicing after "t" in ''Sant,'' the original mutated form of her name, ''*Fraid'' (&lt; *Braid), changes to ''Ffraid'' in some place names such as ''Llansanffraid'' = ''[[St Brides|Saint Bride's Village]]'' and [[Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain]].&lt;ref name="Braint/Ffraid"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilaire Wood|title=Brigit's Forge|url=http://www.brigitsforge.co.uk/st_ffraid.htm|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(In [[gardening]], plants with other kinds of storage organ are also called "[[ornamental bulbous plant]]s" or just "bulbs".)

A bulb's leaf bases, also known as scales, generally do not support leaves, but contain food reserves to enable the plant to survive adverse weather conditions. At the center of the bulb is a vegetative growing point or an unexpanded flowering shoot. The base is formed by a reduced [[Plant stem|stem]], and plant growth occurs from this basal plate. [[Root]]s emerge from the underside of the base, and new stems and leaves from the upper side. '''Tunicate''' bulbs have dry, membranous outer scales that protect the continuous lamina of fleshy scales.&lt;ref name="Mishra"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giqdNdoJNQsC |first=S.R. |last=Mishra |title=Plant Reproduction |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |year=2005 |isbn=978-81-7141-955-5 |pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species in the genera ''[[Allium]]'', ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'', and ''[[Tulip]]a'' all have tunicate bulbs. Non-tunicate bulbs, such as ''[[Lilium]]'' and ''[[Fritillaria]]'' species, lack the protective tunic and have looser scales.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeSW3gkjXFMC |first=Barbara W. |last=Ellis |title=Bulbs |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-618-06890-6 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical term '''[[geophyte]]''' encompasses plants that form underground storage organs, including bulbs as well as [[tubers]] and [[corms]]. Some [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[orchid]]s (family [[Orchidaceae]]) form above-ground storage organs called '''[[pseudobulb]]s''', that superficially resemble bulbs.

Nearly all plants that form true bulbs are [[monocotyledon]]s, and include:
*''[[Amaryllis]]'', ''[[Crinum]]'', ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', ''[[Narcissus (genus)|Narcissus]]'', and several other members of the amaryllis family [[Amaryllidaceae]]. This includes [[onion]], [[garlic]], and other [[allium]]s, members of the Amaryllid subfamily [[Allioideae]].
*[[Lily]], [[tulip]], and many other members of the lily family [[Liliaceae]].
*Two groups of ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' species, family [[Iridaceae]]: subgenus ''[[Iris_subg._Xiphium|Xiphium]]'' (the "Dutch" irises) and subgenus ''[[Hermodactyloides]]'' (the miniature "rock garden" irises).
''[[Oxalis]]'', in the family [[Oxalidaceae]], is the only [[dicotyledon]] genus that produces true bulbs.&lt;ref name="Hartmann"&gt;{{cite book |first=Hudson Thomas |last=Hartmann |author2=Dale E. Kester |title=Hartmann and Kester's Plant Propagation: Principles and Practices |edition=7 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-13-679235-2 |page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OberEmshBellDrey09&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oberlander |first=K.

Bulbous plant species cycle through vegetative and reproductive growth stages; the bulb grows to flowering size during the vegetative stage and the plant flowers during the reproductive stage. Certain environmental conditions are needed to trigger the transition from one stage to the next, such as the shift from a cold winter to spring.&lt;ref name="Mishra"/&gt; Once the flowering period is over, the plant enters a foliage period of about six weeks during which time the plant absorbs nutrients from the soil and energy from the sun for setting flowers for the next year. Bulbs dug up before the foliage period is completed will not bloom the following year but then should flower normally in subsequent years.

After the foliage period is completed, bulbs may be dug up for replanting elsewhere. Any surface moisture should be dried, then the bulbs may be stored up to about 4 months for a fall planting. Storing them much longer than that may cause the bulbs to dry out inside and become nonviable.

== Bulbil ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lilium]] --&gt;
A '''bulbil''' is a small bulb, and may also be called a '''bulblet''', '''bulbet''', or '''bulbel'''.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book |author=Bell, A.D. |year=1997  |title=Plant form: an illustrated guide to flowering plant morphology |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, U.K.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bulbs can develop or propagate a large bulb. If one or several moderate-sized bulbs form to replace the original bulb, they are called '''renewal bulbs'''.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; '''Increase bulbs''' are small bulbs that develop either on each of the leaves inside a bulb, or else on the end of small underground stems connected to the original bulb.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;

Some lilies, such as the tiger lily ''[[Lilium lancifolium]]'', form small bulbs, called bulbils, in their leaf [[axil]]s. Several members of the onion family, Alliaceae, including ''Allium sativum'' ([[garlic]]), form bulbils in their flower heads, sometimes as the flowers fade, or even instead of the flowers (which is a form of [[apomixis]]). The so-called [[tree onion]] (''Allium'' × ''proliferum'') forms small onions which are large enough for [[pickling]].

Some ferns, such as [[Asplenium bulbiferum|the hen-and-chicken fern]], produce new plants at the tips of the fronds' pinnae that are sometimes referred to as bulbils.

'''Elk State Park''' is a {{convert|3192|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Jones Township, Elk County, Pennsylvania|Jones Township]], [[Elk County, Pennsylvania|Elk County]] and [[Sergeant Township, McKean County, Pennsylvania|Sergeant Township]], [[McKean County, Pennsylvania|McKean County]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the United States. [[East Branch Clarion River Lake]] is a man-made lake covering {{convert|1160|acre}} within the park. The lake and streams in the park are stocked with cold and warm water fish. There are {{convert|3151|acre}} of woods open to [[hunting]].

==Recreation==
===East Branch Clarion River Lake=== 
[[East Branch Clarion River Lake]] was constructed by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] by damming the East Branch of the [[Clarion River]]. Construction of the rolled earth, impervious core [[dam]]  was authorized by the [[Flood Control Act of 1944]]. The lake is one of sixteen [[flood control]] projects administered by the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] District of the Army Corps of Engineers. East Branch Clarion River Lake helps to provide flood protection for the [[Clarion River]] valley and the lower portions of the [[Allegheny River]] and the upper portions of the [[Ohio River]].&lt;ref name="lake"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The dam is {{convert|7.3|mi}} upstream from the [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] of the East and West branches of the Clarion River. It was constructed in 1952 for $9 million and serves a {{convert|72.4|sqmi}} drainage area. It is estimated that East Branch Clarion River Lake has prevented $81 million in damage. The dam was especially important in curtailing damage during the 1972 floods caused by [[Hurricane Agnes]].&lt;ref name="lake"/&gt; 

East Branch Clarion River Lake also serves recreational purposes. Controlled releases of water during the dry summer months help to improve water quality and quantity for [[Industry|industrial]] and [[home|domestic]] uses. These releases of the lake waters also improve navigation on the rivers and enhance [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] life.&lt;ref name="lake"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elksp"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2006-11-07
| publisher = [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Branch Clarion River Lake is a destination for both [[fisherman]] and recreational boaters. The lake is home to cold water fishing for [[walleye]], [[smallmouth bass]], [[muskellunge]], [[brook trout|brook]], [[lake trout|lake]], [[rainbow trout|rainbow]] and [[brown trout]]. The [[stream|creek]]s of the park are [[fish stocking|stocked]] by the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]]. There is a native brook trout population in some of the smaller streams of the park. There is no limit on the power of the boats. All boats are required to have current registration with any state. Ice fishing and ice boating are common winter activities on East Branch Clarion River Lake.&lt;ref name="elksp"/&gt;

===Hunting===
There are {{convert|3151|acre}} of woods open to hunting. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]]. The common game species are [[American black bear|black bears]], [[eastern gray squirrel|squirrels]], [[white-tailed deer]], and [[wild turkey|turkeys]]. The hunting of [[groundhog]]s is prohibited. Hunters also use the park to gain access to the nearby State Game Lands and [[Elk State Forest]].&lt;ref name="elksp"/&gt;

'''George Dixon''' (1748 – 11 November 1795) was an English sea captain, explorer, and [[maritime fur trade]]r.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DCB|ID=1855|name=Dixon, George|volume=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Dixon was "born in Leath Ward, a native of [[Kirkoswald, Cumbria|Kirkoswald]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Samuel |last=Jefferson |title=The History and Antiquities of Leath Ward in the County of Cumberland, with Biographical Notices and Memoirs |place=Carlisle |date=1840 |page=484 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRlTAAAAYAAJ |oclc=2026870}}&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Thomas Dixon, he was baptised in Kirkoswald on 8 July 1748.

He served under [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] in his [[third voyage of James Cook|third voyage]], on {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}}, as armourer. In the course of the voyage he learned about the commercial possibilities along the North West Coast of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Dixon’s Voyage Round the World |journal=[[Monthly Review (London)|The Monthly Review]] |volume=80 |date=June 1789 |pages=502–511 |url=https://archive.org/details/monthlyreview105grifgoog |oclc=1772616 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

History has not served Dixon well; for he is the least known of those who served and or were taught by Captain Cook and is only rarely mentioned in history books. When he is mentioned, he is relegated to a minor figure, overshadowed by the more dramatic figures of Cook and [[William Bligh]], another officer on Cook's ill-fated third trip.

In 1782, George Dixon was engaged by [[William Bolts]]. The ''{{lang|de|[[Wiener Zeitung]]}}'' newspaper of 29 June 1782 carried a report from Fiume that, "in the early days of this month, Mr. von Bolts, Director of the [[Triestine East India Company]], together with the English captain, Mr. Digson, arrived in this city".&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.viu.ca/black/amrc/index.htm?home.htm&amp;2 see also ''{{lang|de|Augsburgisches Extra-Blatt}}'', №159, Thursday July 4, 1782]&lt;/ref&gt; George Dixon wrote in the introduction to his account of the voyage he made for the Etches Company to the North West Coast in 1785–1788:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So early as 1781, William Bolts, Esq; fitted out the Cobenzell, an armed ship of 700 tons, for the North-West Coast of America. She was to have sailed from [[Trieste]] (accompanied by a tender of forty-five tons) under [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] colours, and was equally fitted out for trade or discovery: men of eminence in every department of science were engaged on board; all the maritime Courts of Europe were written to, in order to secure a good reception for these vessels, at their respective ports, and favourable answers were returned; yet, after all, this expedition, so exceedingly promising in every point of view, was overcome by a set of interested men, then in power in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;George Dixon, ''A Voyage Round the World'', London, 1789, p.xx&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Triestine Society sent the ''Cobenzell'' in September 1783 on a commercial voyage to the [[Malabar Coast]] and [[China]] by way of the [[Cape of Good Hope]].  After leaving [[Trieste]], she proceeded to [[Marseilles]], where she took in the principal part of her cargo and departed that port in December.  Apparently, Bolts still wished to carry out his North West Coast venture in connection with this voyage, and asked George Dixon to participate.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. King, "Heinrich Zimmermann and the Proposed Voyage of the Royal and Imperial Ship ''Cobenzell'' to the North West Coast in 1782–1783", ''The Northern Mariner/Le Marin du Nord,'' vol.21, no.3, July 2011, pp.235-262.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dixon went back to England, where he attempted to interest Sir Joseph Banks and English merchants in the North West Coast fur trade. This resulted in the formation of the Etches consortium, of which Dixon became a member with appointment as captain of the ''[[Queen Charlotte (1785 ship)|Queen Charlotte]]''. The similarity is notable between the plan of the consortium and that elaborated by Bolts, which was apparently communicated to them by Dixon.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. King, "William Bolts and the Austrian Origins of the Lapérouse Expedition", ''{{lang|la|Terrae Incognitae}}'', vol.40, 2008, pp.1–28&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785, Dixon became a partner in Richard Cadman Etches and Company, commonly called the [[King George's Sound Company]] to develop fur trade in present-day [[British Columbia]] and [[Alaska]]. In September 1785 Dixon and fellow trader [[Nathaniel Portlock]] sailed from England. Portlock was in command of the larger vessel, the 320-ton [[Builder's Old Measurement|bm]] ''[[King George (1785 ship)|King George]]'', with a crew of 59. Dixon commanded the 200 ton (bm) ''[[Queen Charlotte (1785 ship)|Queen Charlotte]]'', with a crew of 33. Dixon and Portlock sailed together for most of their three-year voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pethick |first= Derek |title= First Approaches to the Northwest Coast |publisher= J.J. Douglas |location= Vancouver |date= 1976 |isbn= 0-88894-056-4 |pages= 97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voyage autour du monde - planche IIe - Vue de la Baie de Woahoo.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Oahu, from the French translation of Dixon's book ''A Voyage Round the World'']]

In the summers of 1786 and 1787, Dixon explored the shores of present-day [[British Columbia]] and southeastern Alaska.  He spent the intervening winter in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], where he became the first European to visit the island of [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]]. He anchored in [[Kealakekua Bay]], where Cook had been killed, but did not come ashore.&lt;ref name="bay"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Historic Kealakekua Bay |work=Papers of the Hawaiian Historical Society |location=Honolulu |publisher=The Bulletin Publishing Company |date=1928 |author=Henry B. Restarick |hdl=10524/964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His chief areas of exploration were the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]] and [[Queen Charlotte Sound (Canada)|Queen Charlotte Sound]], [[Yakutat Bay]] (Port Mulgrave), [[Sitka Sound]] (Norfolk Bay), and the [[Dixon Entrance]]. While not the first European to explore the region of the Queen Charlotte Islands, he was the first to realize they were islands and not part of the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=Derek |title=Historical Atlas of the Pacific Northwest: Maps of exploration and Discovery |date=1999 |publisher=[[Sasquatch Books]] |isbn=1-57061-215-3 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After visiting China and selling his cargo, he returned to England in 1788 and published, in 1789, ''A Voyage Round the World, but More Particularly to the North-West Coast of America''.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, (1789)&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was a collection of descriptive letters by William Beresford, his cargo officer, and valuable charts and appendices by Dixon.

There was a controversy between Dixon and [[John Meares]], another explorer who had published a book claiming credit for discoveries Dixon thought were made by others.  This controversy resulted in three pamphlets by Dixon and Meares denouncing each other.  In retrospect, history seems to support Dixon's view that Meares was dishonest.

In 1789 Dixon met with Alexander Dalrymple, the Examiner of Sea Journals for the East India Company and an influential advocate of maritime exploration, and the Under-Secretary of the Home and Colonial Office, Evan Nepean. He urged on Nepean the need to take up Dalrymple’s plan for a settlement on the North West Coast to prevent the Russians, Americans or Spanish from establishing themselves there. Dixon was afraid that if nothing was done the coast and its trade would be lost to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon to Evan Nepean, 14 July 1789, National Archives, Kew, CO 42/72, ff.24–31 and at Public Archives of Canada, Ottawa, Q series, vol.49, p.354, printed in ''[https://archive.org/stream/reportoncanadian1889publuoft Report on Canadian Archives 1889],''  Ottawa, 1890, p. 29; cited in [[Barry M. Gough]], "The Northwest Coast in Late 18th Century British Expansion", in Thomas Vaughan (ed.), ''The Western Shore,'' Portland, Oregon Historical Society and American Revolution Bicentennial Commission of Oregon, 1975, pp.48–80, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 1789, he wrote to Sir Joseph Banks regarding the expedition being fitted out under the command of his former {{HMS|Discovery|1774|2}} shipmate, [[Henry Roberts (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Roberts]], for discovery in the South Seas. He offered suggestions on the type of vessels that would be suitable and proposed the Queen Charlotte Islands as the best place to form a settlement on the North West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon to Sir Joseph Banks, 20 October 1789, reproduced in Richard H. Dillon, "Letters of Captain George Dixon in the Banks Collection", ''British Columbia Historical Quarterly,'' vol.XIV, no.3, 1950, pp.167–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a George Dixon who taught navigation at [[Gosport]], [[England]] and wrote a treatise entitled ''The Navigator's Assistant'' in 1791.  This may or may not be the same George Dixon.

Dixon arrived in Bermuda with his wife, Ann, via New York in February 1794. His intention was to revert to his original training and work as a silversmith/jeweller. This is borne out by an advertisement in ''[[The Bermuda Gazette]]'' in April 1794 announcing his intentions: "George Dixon, jeweller from London". ''The Bermuda Gazette'' soon reported that Dixon's wife Ann, "lately from England", died in childbirth in May 1794: she was buried at St George, Bermuda on 20 May 1794. Dixon was left with his only child, Marianna. He himself died shortly afterwards on 11 November 1795, as confirmed by a notice in the ''Cumberland Pacquet'' in February 1796: "[died] November 11 at Bermuda, Capt Dixon, the circumnavigator, a native of Kirkoswald in this county". The orphaned Marianna Dixon married a Bermudian merchant, Charles Bryan Hayward, in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan L.

In [[thermodynamics]] and [[engineering]], a '''heat engine''' is a system that converts heat or [[thermal energy]]—and [[chemical energy]]—to [[mechanical energy]], which can then be used to do [[mechanical work]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics'', 3rd ed. p. 159, (1985) by G. J. Van Wylen and R. E. Sonntag: "A heat engine may be defined as a device that operates in a thermodynamic cycle and does a certain amount of net positive work as a result of heat transfer from a high-[[temperature]] body and to a low-temperature body. Often the term heat engine is used in a broader sense to include all devices that produce work, either through heat transfer or combustion, even though the device does not operate in a thermodynamic cycle. The internal-combustion engine and the gas turbine are examples of such devices, and calling these heat engines is an acceptable use of the term."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mechanical efficiency of heat engines'', p. 1 (2007) by James R. Senf: "Heat engines are made to provide mechanical energy from thermal energy."&lt;/ref&gt; It does this by bringing a [[working substance]] from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature. A heat source generates thermal energy that brings the working substance to the high temperature state. The working substance generates work in the [[Thermodynamic system|working body]] of the engine while [[Heat transfer|transferring heat]] to the colder [[Thermal reservoir|sink]] until it reaches a low temperature state. During this process some of the thermal energy is converted into [[energy|work]] by exploiting the properties of the working substance. The working substance can be any system with a non-zero [[heat capacity]], but it usually is a gas or liquid. During this process, a lot of heat is lost to the surroundings and so cannot be converted to work.

In general an [[engine]] converts energy to mechanical [[Work (physics)|work]]. Heat engines distinguish themselves from other types of engines by the fact that their efficiency is fundamentally limited by [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;''Thermal physics: entropy and free energies'', by Joon Chang Lee (2002), Appendix A, p. 183: "A heat engine absorbs energy from a heat source and then converts it into work for us.... When the engine absorbs heat energy, the absorbed heat energy comes with entropy." (heat energy &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q=T \Delta S&lt;/math&gt;), "When the engine performs work, on the other hand, no entropy leaves the engine. This is problematic. We would like the engine to repeat the process again and again to provide us with a steady work source. ... to do so, the working substance inside the engine must return to its initial thermodynamic condition after a cycle, which requires to remove the remaining entropy. The engine can do this only in one way. It must let part of the absorbed heat energy leave without converting it into work. Therefore the engine cannot convert all of the input energy into work!"&lt;/ref&gt; Although this efficiency limitation can be a drawback, an advantage of heat engines is that most forms of energy can be easily converted to heat by processes like [[exothermic reaction]]s (such as combustion), [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of light or energetic particles, [[friction]], [[dissipation]] and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]. Since the heat source that supplies thermal energy to the engine can thus be powered by virtually any kind of energy, heat engines are very versatile and have a wide range of applicability.

Heat engines are often confused with the cycles they attempt to implement. Typically, the term "engine" is used for a physical device and "cycle" for the model.

==Overview==
[[Image:heat engine.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 1: Heat engine diagram]]

In [[thermodynamics]], heat engines are often modeled using a standard engineering model such as the [[Otto cycle]]. The theoretical model can be refined and augmented with actual data from an operating engine, using tools such as an [[indicator diagram]]. Since very few actual implementations of heat engines exactly match their underlying thermodynamic cycles, one could say that a thermodynamic cycle is an ideal case of a mechanical engine. In any case, fully understanding an engine and its efficiency requires gaining a good understanding of the (possibly simplified or idealized) theoretical model, the practical nuances of an actual mechanical engine, and the discrepancies between the two.

In general terms, the larger the difference in temperature between the hot source and the cold sink, the larger is the potential [[thermal efficiency]] of the cycle. On Earth, the cold side of any heat engine is limited to being close to the ambient temperature of the environment, or not much lower than 300 [[kelvin]]s, so most efforts to improve the thermodynamic efficiencies of various heat engines focus on increasing the temperature of the source, within material limits. The maximum theoretical efficiency of a heat engine (which no engine ever attains) is equal to the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends divided by the temperature at the hot end, all expressed as [[absolute temperature]]s (in [[kelvin]]s).

The efficiency of various heat engines proposed or used today has a large range: 
* 3%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mahmoud_Shaaban7/publication/237251713_EXPERIMENTAL_INVESTIGATIONS_ON_A_STANDING-WAVE_THERMOACOUSTIC_ENGINE/links/58ecf2870f7e9bf619bb01e2/EXPERIMENTAL-INVESTIGATIONS-ON-A-STANDING-WAVE-THERMOACOUSTIC-ENGINE.pdf |title=Experimental Investigations on a Standing-Wave Thermoacoustic Engine |last=Eman |first=Mahmod Mohamed |date=June 2013 |access-date=January 21, 2018 |publisher=[[Cairo University]] |work=[[ResearchGate]] |format=PDF |location=Giza, Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt; (97 percent waste heat using low quality heat) for the [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|OTEC]] ocean power proposal.
* 25% for most automotive gasoline engines &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/atv.shtml  Where the Energy Goes: Gasoline Vehicles], US Dept of Energy&lt;/ref&gt;
* 49% for a [[Supercritical steam generator|supercritical]] [[coal-fired power station]] such as the [[Avedøre Power Station]], and many others
* 60% for a steam-cooled [[combined cycle]] [[gas turbine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Efficiency by the Numbers| url=http://memagazine.asme.org/Web/Efficiency_by_Numbers.cfm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616132320/http://memagazine.asme.org/Web/Efficiency_by_Numbers.cfm| archivedate=16 June 2009| last1=Langston| first1=Lee S.| publisher=ASME| deadurl=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these processes gain their efficiency (or lack thereof) from the temperature drop across them. Significant energy may be used for auxiliary equipment, such as pumps, which effectively reduces efficiency.

===Power===
Heat engines can be characterized by their [[power density|specific power]], which is typically given in kilowatts per litre of [[engine displacement]] (in the U.S. also [[horsepower]] per cubic inch). The result offers an approximation of the peak power output of an engine. This is not to be confused with [[fuel efficiency]], since high efficiency often requires a lean fuel-air ratio, and thus lower power density. A modern high-performance car engine makes in excess of 75&amp;nbsp;kW/l (1.65&amp;nbsp;hp/in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Everyday examples==
Examples of everyday heat engines include the [[steam engine]] and the [[internal combustion engine]]. The [[stirling engine]] is also heat engine, as well as the [[drinking bird]] toy. All of these heat engines are powered by the expansion of heated gases.

==Examples of heat engines==
It is important to note that although some cycles have a typical combustion location (internal or external), they often can be implemented with the other. For example, [[John Ericsson]]&lt;ref name="hae-ericsson1833"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/ericsson/the-engine-of-1833|title=Ericsson's 1833 caloric engine|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an external heated engine running on a cycle very much like the earlier [[Diesel cycle]]. In addition, externally heated engines can often be implemented in open or closed cycles.

=== Earth's heat engine ===
Earth's atmosphere and hydrosphere—Earth’s heat engine—are coupled processes that constantly even out solar heating imbalances through evaporation of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation, when distributing heat around the globe.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2009"&gt;{{cite journal

The Hadley system provides an example of a heat engine. The Hadley circulation is identified with rising of warm and moist air in the equatorial region with descent of colder air in the subtropics corresponding to a thermally driven direct circulation, with consequent net production of kinetic energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Junling Huang and Michael B. McElroy|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00538.1|title=Contributions of the Hadley and Ferrel Circulations to the Energetics of the Atmosphere over the Past 32 Years|journal=Journal of Climate |issue=7| volume=27 |pages=2656–2666 |year=2014 |doi=10.1175/jcli-d-13-00538.1|bibcode = 2014JCli...27.2656H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase-change cycles===
In these cycles and engines, the working fluids are gases and liquids.  The engine converts the working fluid from a gas to a liquid, from liquid to gas, or both, generating work from the fluid expansion or compression.
* [[Rankine cycle]] (classical [[steam engine]])
* [[Regenerative cycle]] ([[steam engine]] more efficient than [[Rankine cycle]])
* [[Organic Rankine cycle]] (Coolant changing phase in temperature ranges of ice and hot liquid water)
* Vapor to liquid cycle ([[Drinking bird]], [[Injector]], [[Minto wheel]])
* Liquid to solid cycle ([[Frost heaving]] — water changing from ice to liquid and back again can lift rock up to 60&amp;nbsp;cm.)
* Solid to gas cycle ([[Dry ice cannon]] — Dry ice sublimes to gas.)

===Gas-only cycles===
In these cycles and engines the working fluid is always a gas (i.e., there is no phase change):
* [[Carnot cycle]] ([[Carnot heat engine]])
* [[Ericsson cycle]] (Caloric Ship John Ericsson)
* [[Stirling cycle]] ([[Stirling engine]]&lt;ref name="hae-stirling1842"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/stirling/the-stirling-engine-of-1842|title=Stirling's 1842 air engine|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Thermoacoustic refrigeration|thermoacoustic]] devices)
* [[Internal combustion engine]] (ICE):
** [[Otto cycle]] (e.g. [[Gasoline/Petrol engine]])
** [[Diesel cycle]] (e.g. [[Diesel engine]])
** [[Atkinson cycle]] (Atkinson engine)
** [[Brayton cycle]] or [[Joule cycle]] originally [[Ericsson cycle]] ([[gas turbine]])
** [[Lenoir cycle]] (e.g., [[pulse jet engine]])
** [[Miller cycle]] (Miller engine)

===Liquid only cycle===
In these cycles and engines the working fluid are always like liquid:
* [[Stirling cycle]] ([[Malone engine]])
* Heat Regenerative Cyclone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclonepower.com/works.html |title=Cyclone Power Technologies Website |publisher=Cyclonepower.com |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119094540/http://www.cyclonepower.com/works.html |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electron cycles===
* [[Johnson thermoelectric energy converter]]
* Thermoelectric ([[Peltier–Seebeck effect]])
* [[Thermogalvanic cell]]
* [[Thermionic emission]]
* [[Thermotunnel cooling]]

===Magnetic cycles===
* [[Thermo-magnetic motor]] (Tesla)

===Cycles used for refrigeration===
{{main article|refrigeration}}
A domestic [[refrigerator]] is an example of a [[heat pump]]: a heat engine in reverse. Work is used to create a heat differential. Many cycles can run in reverse to move heat from the cold side to the hot side, making the cold side cooler and the hot side hotter. Internal combustion engine versions of these cycles are, by their nature, not reversible.

Refrigeration cycles include:
* [[Vapor-compression refrigeration]]
* [[Stirling engine#Stirling cryocoolers|Stirling cryocoolers]]
* [[Gas-absorption refrigerator]]
* [[Air cycle machine]]
* [[Vuilleumier refrigeration]]
* [[Magnetic refrigeration]]

===Evaporative heat engines===
The [[Barton evaporation engine]] is a heat engine based on a cycle producing power and cooled moist air from the evaporation of water into hot dry air.

===Mesoscopic heat engines===
Mesoscopic heat engines are nanoscale devices that may serve the goal of processing heat fluxes and perform useful work at small scales. Potential applications include e.g. electric cooling devices.
In such mesoscopic heat engines, work per cycle of operation fluctuates due to thermal noise.
There is exact equality that relates average of exponents of work performed by any heat engine and the heat transfer from the hotter heat bath.&lt;ref name='sinitsyn-11jpa'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fluctuation Relation for Heat Engines|author=N. A. Sinitsyn |journal=J. Phys. A: Math. Theor.|volume=44|year=2011|page=405001|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/44/40/405001|arxiv = 1111.7014 |bibcode = 2011JPhA...44N5001S }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- N.A. Sinitsyn 2011 JPA ''44''' 405001 --&gt; This relation transforms the Carnot's inequality into exact equality.

==Efficiency==
The efficiency of a heat engine relates how much useful work is output for a given amount of heat energy input.

From the laws of [[thermodynamics]], after a completed cycle:

:&lt;math&gt; W \ = \ Q_c \ - \ (-Q_h) &lt;/math&gt;
:where
:&lt;math&gt; W = -\oint PdV &lt;/math&gt; is the work extracted from the engine. (It is negative since work is ''done by'' the engine.)
:&lt;math&gt; Q_h = T_h\Delta S_h &lt;/math&gt; is the heat energy taken from the high temperature system. (It is negative since heat is extracted from the source, hence &lt;math&gt;(-Q_h)&lt;/math&gt; is positive.)
:&lt;math&gt; Q_c = T_c\Delta S_c &lt;/math&gt; is the heat energy delivered to the cold temperature system. (It is positive since heat is added to the sink.)

In other words, a heat engine absorbs heat energy from the high temperature heat source, converting part of it to useful work and delivering the rest to the cold temperature heat sink.

In general, the efficiency of a given heat transfer process (whether it be a refrigerator, a heat pump or an engine) is defined informally by the ratio of "what you get out" to "what you put in".

In the case of an engine, one desires to extract work and puts in a heat transfer.

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{-W}{-Q_h} = \frac{-Q_h - Q_c}{-Q_h} = 1 - \frac{Q_c}{-Q_h}&lt;/math&gt;

The ''theoretical'' maximum efficiency of any heat engine depends only on the temperatures it operates between. This efficiency is usually derived using an ideal imaginary heat engine such as the [[Carnot heat engine]], although other engines using different cycles can also attain maximum efficiency. Mathematically, this is because in [[Thermodynamic reversibility|reversible]] processes, the change in [[entropy]] of the cold reservoir is the negative of that of the hot reservoir (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_c = -\Delta S_h&lt;/math&gt;), keeping the overall change of entropy zero. Thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_\text{max} = 1 - \frac{T_c \Delta S_c}{-T_h \Delta S_h} = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[absolute temperature]] of the hot source and &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; that of the cold sink, usually measured in [[kelvin]]s. Note that &lt;math&gt;dS_c&lt;/math&gt; is positive while &lt;math&gt;dS_h&lt;/math&gt; is negative; in any reversible work-extracting process, entropy is overall not increased, but rather is moved from a hot (high-entropy) system to a cold (low-entropy one), decreasing the entropy of the heat source and increasing that of the heat sink.

The reasoning behind this being the '''maximal''' efficiency goes as follows. It is first assumed that if a more efficient heat engine than a Carnot engine is possible, then it could be driven in reverse as a heat pump. Mathematical analysis can be used to show that this assumed combination would result in a net decrease in [[entropy]]. Since, by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], this is statistically improbable to the point of exclusion, the Carnot efficiency is a theoretical upper bound on the reliable efficiency of ''any'' thermodynamic cycle.

Empirically, no heat engine has ever been shown to run at a greater efficiency than a Carnot cycle heat engine.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 show variations on Carnot cycle efficiency. Figure 2 indicates how efficiency changes with an increase in the heat addition temperature for a constant compressor inlet temperature. Figure 3 indicates how the efficiency changes with an increase in the heat rejection temperature for a constant turbine inlet temperature.

===Endoreversible heat engines===
The most Carnot efficiency as a criterion of heat engine performance is the fact that by its nature, any maximally efficient Carnot cycle must operate at an infinitesimal temperature gradient. This is because ''any'' transfer of heat between two bodies at differing temperatures is irreversible, and therefore the Carnot efficiency expression only applies in the infinitesimal limit. The major problem with that is that the object of most heat engines is to output some sort of power, and infinitesimal power is usually not what is being sought.

A different measure of ideal heat engine efficiency is given by considerations of [[endoreversible thermodynamics]], where the cycle is identical to the Carnot cycle except in that the two processes of heat transfer are ''not'' reversible (Callen 1985):

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{T_c}{T_h}}&lt;/math&gt; (Note: Units [[kelvin|K]] or [[Rankine scale|°R]])

This model does a better job of predicting how well real-world heat engines can do (Callen 1985, see also [[endoreversible thermodynamics]]):

As shown, the endoreversible efficiency much more closely models the observed.

==History==
{{Main article|Timeline of heat engine technology}}
{{See also|History of the internal combustion engine|History of thermodynamics}}

Heat engines have been known since antiquity but were only made into useful devices at the time of the industrial revolution in the 18th century. They continue to be developed today.

==Heat engine enhancements==
Engineers have studied the various heat engine cycles extensively in effort to improve the amount of usable work they could extract from a given power source. The Carnot cycle limit cannot be reached with any gas-based cycle, but engineers have worked out at least two ways to possibly go around that limit, and one way to get better efficiency without bending any rules.
# Increase the temperature difference in the heat engine. The simplest way to do this is to increase the hot side temperature, which is the approach used in modern combined-cycle [[gas turbine]]s. Unfortunately, physical limits (such as the melting point of the materials used to build the engine) and environmental concerns regarding [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] production restrict the maximum temperature on workable heat engines. Modern gas turbines run at temperatures as high as possible within the range of temperatures necessary to maintain acceptable NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; output {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Another way of increasing efficiency is to lower the output temperature. One new method of doing so is to use mixed chemical working fluids, and then exploit the changing behavior of the mixtures. One of the most famous is the so-called [[Kalina cycle]], which uses a 70/30 mix of [[ammonia]] and water as its working fluid. This mixture allows the cycle to generate useful power at considerably lower temperatures than most other processes.
# Exploit the physical properties of the working fluid. The most common such exploitation is the use of water above the so-called critical point, or so-called supercritical steam. The behavior of fluids above their critical point changes radically, and with materials such as water and [[carbon dioxide]] it is possible to exploit those changes in behavior to extract greater thermodynamic efficiency from the heat engine, even if it is using a fairly conventional Brayton or Rankine cycle. A newer and very promising material for such applications is [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[xenon]] have also been considered for such applications, although SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is toxic.
# Exploit the chemical properties of the working fluid. A fairly new and novel exploit is to use exotic working fluids with advantageous chemical properties. One such is [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a toxic component of smog, which has a natural [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] as di-nitrogen tetraoxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). At low temperature, the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is compressed and then heated. The increasing temperature causes each N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to break apart into two NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. This lowers the molecular weight of the working fluid, which drastically increases the efficiency of the cycle. Once the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has expanded through the turbine, it is cooled by the [[heat sink]], which makes it recombine into N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This is then fed back by the compressor for another cycle. Such species as [[aluminium bromide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), NOCl, and Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; have all been investigated for such uses. To date, their drawbacks have not warranted their use, despite the efficiency gains that can be realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Nuclear%20Reactors%20Concepts%20and%20Thermodynamic%20Cycles.pdf |title=Nuclear Reactors Concepts and Thermodynamic Cycles |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318233007/https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Nuclear%20Reactors%20Concepts%20and%20Thermodynamic%20Cycles.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;'''Hypsometric tints''' (also called layer tinting, elevation tinting, elevation coloring, or hysometric coloring) are colors placed between [[contour lines]] to indicate [[elevation]]. These tints are shown as bands of color in a graduated scheme or as a [[color gradient|color ramp]] applied to contour lines themselves. A typical scheme progresses from dark greens for lower elevations, up through yellows/browns and on to grays and white at the highest elevations. &lt;ref name=hypo_tint&gt; Buckley, Alileen. [http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2008/05/09/hysometric-tinting/ Hysometric tinting] "ArcGIS Resource Center Blog". Esri 9 May 2008. &lt;small&gt; Accessed 20 December 2017&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hypsometric tinting of maps and [[globe]]s is often accompanied by a similar method of [[bathymetry|bathymetric]] tinting to convey depth of [[ocean]]s; lighter shades of blue represent shallower water such as the [[continental shelf]] and darker shades deeper regions.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== History ==
In his map of central [[Italy]], c.1503, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] introduced the cartographic convention of using colored chalk to indicate changes in elevation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?maker=12196&amp;object=912277&amp;row=436 Royal Collection - A map of central Italy (Leonardo da Vinci)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thewalters.org/exhibitions/maps/image_pages/leonardo.html Claim of da Vinci's first use]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rear map.jpg|thumb|right|First map of oceanic bathymetry, derived from [[USS Dolphin (1836)]] data]]
Around the 1600s, the [[barometer]] was invented. For the first time, a scientific way of measuring elevations was possible. Francois Pasumot, became the first to develop a table to compare [[spot height]]s. As a result, the [[interpolation]] of [[spot height]]s to create [[contour lines]] was successfully done in France, Germany and Denmark. In Austria the late 1820s, Franz von Hauslab was credited for the first colored contour maps using [[lithography]]. With the invention of [[chromolithography]], copies of colored maps became more accessible. &lt;ref&gt; Patterson, Tom and Bernhard Jenny. "The Development and Rationale of Cross-Blended Hypsometric Tints." Cartographic Perspectives, no. 69, May 2011, pp. 31-45.

The [[Scotland|Scottish]] map firm [[Collins Bartholomew|John Bartholomew and Son]] is credited with popularizing the colored [[contour line]] technique, and their color scheme has become conventional: dark greens at low elevations, progressing through yellows and others, to browns and then grays and white at the highest elevations.

note about misinterpretation of traditional color scale e.g; green as forest, yellow as desert, brown as bare dirt, gray as rock, white as snow; among others site Patterson pp.9-10. Trying to find article about new scale proposed by ESRI in the early 2000s. It did not remedy this completely as I recall, but in addressing issues of use within GIS did result in a more natural appearance

Some cartographers have suggested that hypsometric tints are often used as decoration, rather than for informational purposes:&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Patterson (cartographer)|Patterson, T]]. and [[Nathaniel Vaughn Kelso|Vaughn Kelso, K]]. (2004). ''[http://www.shadedrelief.com/shelton/article/shelton.pdf#page=9 Hal Shelton Revisited: Designing and Producing Natural-Color Maps with Satellite Land Cover Data]''. &lt;u&gt;Cartographic Perspectives, 47&lt;/u&gt;. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;hellip;the current popularity of hypsometric tints has more to do with production ease and pretty colors than it does with our interest in elevation. &amp;hellip; With hypsometric tints, the end result is often a map with pleasing colors that blend softly into one another in an orderly fashion, a design trait that people find attractive, even if they don’t necessarily know or care about elevations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers''' ('''IAM''') is an [[AFL-CIO]]/[[Canadian Labour Congress|CLC]] trade union representing approx. 646,933 workers as of 2006 in more than 200 industries with most of its membership in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

== Origin ==
[[File:IAM 831 hall.jpg|thumb|International Association of Machinists Local 831 Hall in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]] ]]
On May 5, 1888, [[Thomas W. Talbot]], a [[railroad]] machinist in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], founded the [[Order of United Machinists and Mechanical Engineers]]. Talbot and 18 others had been members in the [[Knights of Labor]]. Talbot believed that a union needed to be formed for [[railroad]] machinists that would resist wage cuts. He wanted to provide insurance against unemployment, illness, and accidents but also wanted railroad machinists to be recognized for their craft skill. Unlike the Knights of Labor, who accepted everyone, Talbot's union accepted only white U.S. citizens, preferably native-born. The union excluded blacks, women, and non-citizens, and had secret passwords. Despite the secrecy, the order spread beyond Georgia, thanks in part to "boomers", men who traveled the railway lines for work. These boomers established local lodges in new areas. Within one year there were 40 lodges, and by 1891, there were 189.

On May 6, 1889, the Machinsts held their first major convention in Atlanta. Talbot was elected the Grand Master Machinist (later known as the international president), and [[William L. Dawley]] was elected as Grand Secretary (now known as Grand Secretary-Treasurer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Association of Machinists Digital Publication|website=dlib.gsu.edu/spcoll/IAMAW/index|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Organization's name was changed to the National Association of Machinists (NAM) and a constitution was drawn up. The NAM began publishing the 16-page ''Machinists Monthly Journal''. Also in 1889, Frank French designed an emblem for the union. The emblem consisted of a flywheel, a friction joint caliper, and a machinist's square with the initials of the organization. According to French, the flywheel represented the ongoing power of the union once it started, and the caliper signified an extended invitation to all persons of civilized countries.&lt;ref name="Washington DC Kelly Press Inc."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodden G.|first1=Robert|title=The Fighting Machinist: A Century of Struggle.|date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The square signified that IAM was square and honest.

In 1890 and 1891, NAM reached Canada, making Canadians the first international members. Locals were also formed in [[Mexico]]. To reflect this, in 1891 the name was changed from National Association of Machinists to International Association of Machinists (IAM), at a conference in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].

In 1892, IAM signed a contract with the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]], establishing the first organized shop at a railroad in the United States. Because IAM had a color bar, the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) did not accept IAM right away. 

After IAM finally did join the AFL, AFL President [[Samuel Gompers]] urged IAM to drop its whites-only rule. But IAM maintained racial segregation, arguing that it needed to retain southern members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murolo|first1=Priscilla|title=From the Folks Who Brought You the Weekend: A Short Illustrated History of Labor in the United States. |date=2001 |publisher=New York: News Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAM chief Talbot's wanted the union to be a fraternity of white men born in the United States who possessed good moral character.

==1920-40s==
The Machinists' membership reached 300,000 during [[World War I]] which at the time made it the largest union in 1918. As the war ended and wartime production came to an end membership dropped to 80,000 in 1923. Membership declined in 1933 to only 50,000 due to the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. Of those 50,000 members, 23,000 workers were unemployed. In 1935 the machinists started to organize with the airline industry. In 1936, the [[Boeing]] Company in [[Seattle, Washington]] signed the industry's first labor agreement. By 1938, the IAM negotiated the first union agreement in air transportation with Eastern Air Lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnesen|first1=Eric|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working- Class History|date=2007|publisher=New York, NY: Taylor &amp; Francis Group LLC|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 IAM union members established an education department to publish a supplemental journal. This journal would be published weekly by the Machinist the IAM newspaper. Eventually the Journals production was cut back to twice a year and was voted out of existence in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.goiam.org|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced with a quarterly magazine entitled The IAMW journal. 

===Break with AFL===
The break was over a failure of the AFL to settle a jurisdictional dispute between IAM and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America as well as the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees of America. IAM disaffiliated with the AFL in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murolo|first1=Priscilla|title=From the Folks Who Brought You the Weekend: A short, Illustrated History of Labor in the United States|date=2001|publisher=New York: New Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 Congress passed the [[Taft Hartley Act]], officially known as the Labor-Management Relations Act, which placed restrictions on union activities. This act also contained provisions that made closed shops illegal and outlawed boycotts. The second section of the Taft Hartley Act was controversial because it allowed states to pass [[right-to-work laws]], which enabled them to regulate the number of union shops. Furthermore, the machinists worked with AFL unions to repeal the act. The limitations imposed on union political activity by this act led to the creation of the Machinists' Non- Partisan Political League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnesen|first1=Eric|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working – Class History|date=2007|publisher=New York, NY; Taylor &amp; Francis Group LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Lodge 751 went on strike against the Boeing Company in Seattle, Washington. The machinists preserved longstanding seniority rules that the company wanted to abolish and achieved a 10% per hour raise. IAM also competed for members with the [[United Auto Workers of America]] in the automotive industry and with the United Aerospace Workers for aircraft working in that union. In 1949, IAM signed no-raiding agreements with both unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weir|first1=Robert|title=Workers in America: A Historical Encyclopedia|date=2013|publisher=Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, LLC|edition=2nd, Vol 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those agreements become the model for other unions when AFL and the CIO merged in 1955.

The 1950s was a period of rapid growth for IAM. The production of jet engines during the war led IAM to expand to the aircraft industry. By 1958, IAM had more than 900,000 members. This was because IAM took steps to begin to move away from its racist past. In 1955, under the leadership of President Al Hayes IAM became more of an industrial union; it began to shift from railroad work to metal fabrication. IAM had more union members as well as workers in the aircraft industry. Thus, Aerospace workers were attracted to join IAM. The trade union produced a first-of-its-kind radio show, [[Boomer Jones]], to tell their history in a modern way.

In 1964, IAM changed its name to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. IAMAW began to strike against five major airlines, including Eastern, National, Northwest, Trans World, and [[United Airlines]]. 35,400 IAMAW members in 231 cities grounded the airlines for 43 days finally winning 5% raises in three successive years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aresen|first1=Eric|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working- Class History.|date=2007|publisher=New York, NY: Taylor &amp; Francis Group LLC|edition=2nd. Vol.2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAM membership nearly doubled in the 1950s, in large part due to the burgeoning airline industry, from 501,000 members in 1949 to 903,000 members in 1958. As a result of the influx of members from the airlines and the new American space program, the delegates voted to change the name to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at the 1964 convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iamlocal2569.com/textonly.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817200004/http://www.iamlocal2569.com/textonly.htm |archivedate=August 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, due to individual and corporate bankruptcies IAM membership dropped to 820,211 members from a high of 927,000 in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamlocal2569.com/textonly.htm "IAM History".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817200004/http://www.iamlocal2569.com/textonly.htm |date=August 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1982 boycott was initiated by the IAM against [[Brown &amp; Sharpe]], a machine, precision, measuring and cutting tool manufacturer, headquartered in [[Rhode Island]]. The boycott was called after the firm refused to bargain in good faith (withdrawing previously negotiated clauses in the contract), and forced the union into a strike, during which police sprayed pepper gas on some 800 picketers at the company's [[North Kingston, Rhode Island|North Kingston]] plant in early 1982. Three weeks later, a machinist narrowly escaped serious injury when a shot fired into the picket line hit his belt buckle.

The [[National Labor Relations Board]] later charged Brown &amp; Sharpe with regressive bargaining, and of entering into negotiations with the express purpose of not reaching an agreement with the union. It was not until 1998, nearly seventeen years after the strike began, that the Rhode Island Supreme Court ended the legal battle, ultimately siding with Brown &amp; Sharpe in its plea that it had not illegally forced the strike. By this point, both Brown &amp; Sharpe and its erstwhile work force were retreating from manufacturing in Rhode Island.

From 1981 to 1990 the union owned and operated an Indy Car racing team, [[Machinists Union Racing]].

On September 7, 2008 the union began a [[Boeing Machinists Strike of 2008|strike]] against [[Boeing]] over issues with outsourcing, [[job security]], pay and benefits.

The [[Transportation Communications International Union]] (TCU) merged with the IAM, after a TCU member vote in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Your Union}} http://railroadworkersunited.org/about-your-union/ access-date=February 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The union continues to expand into different companies today.

In December 2013 the union's attempt to represent workers at an [[Amazon.com]] fulfillment center in Middletown, Delaware failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon Workers Vote Against Forming Union}} http://business.time.com/2014/01/15/amazon-union/ access-date=October 10, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
According to IAM's Department of Labor records since 2005, when membership classifications were first reported, the union's membership has been generally in a slow decline, including "dues paying," "retired," and "exempt" members. Despite this, "life" members report a 22% increase during this period, and "unemployed" members momentarily increased to a peak in 2009 before also declining. Members classified as "on strike" have varied considerably throughout, though remaining less than 1% of the total membership. IAM contracts also cover some non-members, known as [[agency fee]] payers, which since 2005 have grown to number comparatively just over 1% of the size of the union's membership.&lt;ref name="OLMS"/&gt; As of 2013 this accounts for about 145,000 "retirees" (25%), 52,000 "life" members (9%), 26,000 "exempt" members (5%) and 14,000 "unemployed" members (2%), plus about 7,000 non-members paying agency fees, compared to about 333,000 "dues paying" members (58%).&lt;ref name="OLMS_LM-2_2014-03-31"/&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation'''|独立行政法人石油天然ガス・金属鉱物資源機構|Sekiyu ten'nen gasu kinzoku kōbutsu shigen kikō|'''JOGMEC'''}}, is a Japanese government [[Independent Administrative Institution]] which was created in 2004 when the former Japan National Oil Corporation merged with the former Metal Mining Agency of Japan.&lt;ref name="about1"&gt;[http://www.jogmec.go.jp/english/index.html  Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation] (JOGMEC): [http://www.jogmec.go.jp/english/aboutus/index.html  About us, overview].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
JOGMEC integrates corollary functions in one administrative entity.  The former Japan National Oil Corporation (JNOC) had been tasked with securing a stable supply of [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] for Japan's use. The former [[Metal]] Mining Agency of Japan (MMAJ) had been tasked with ensuring a stable supply of [[nonferrous]] metal and [[mineral]] resources for Japan's use.  Greater efficiencies were realized by combining two bureaucracies with similar missions{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.  JOGMEC was established in 2004 pursuant to the 2002 Law Concerning the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;JOGMEC: [http://www.jogmec.go.jp/english/aboutus/history.html  About us, history].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jogmec.go.jp/english/aboutus/docs/jogmec_law_2005.pdf |title=Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation |publisher=JOGMEC |date= |accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, JOGMEC becomes the first to successfully extract [[Methane clathrate|methane hydrate]] from [[seabed]] deposits.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/12/us-methane-hydrates-japan-idUSBRE92B07620130312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By HIROKO TABUCHIMARCH 12, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/business/global/japan-says-it-is-first-to-tap-methane-hydrate-deposit.html |title=An Energy Coup for Japan: ‘Flammable Ice’ - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2013-03-12 |accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
JOGMEC's Geological Remote Satellite Sensing Centre in [[Lobatse]], [[Botswana]] was created in partnership with the southern African nation's Department of Geological Survey in July 2008.  The Japan-Botswana partnership will work together in developing the exploration of minerals through methods such as [[remote sensing]].&lt;ref&gt;Botswana Press Agency (BOPA): [http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20090324&amp;i=Geological_satellite_centre_welcome  "Geological satellite centre welcome."] March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19356">The [[Gulf Stream]] separates from the US coast near [[Cape Hatteras]] (35°N, 75°W) and then travels eastwards across the [[North Atlantic]], becoming the [[North Atlantic current]] at about 55°W. In the region between 75°W and 55°W it is subject to [[meanders]] and is frequently accompanied by [[eddies]]. The northern edge of the current is marked by a sharp fall in temperature. This is also the case at much greater depths, so that the warm current is pressed up against a wall of cold water, called the ‘north wall’. Monthly charts of the path of the north wall of the Gulf Stream have been available from surface, aircraft and satellite observations since 1966 and these have been used in several studies of the path’s variability.

==History==
In 1980, Taylor and Stephens[2]&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A.H. and Stephens, J.A. (1980), "Latitudinal displacements of the Gulf Stream and their relation to changes in temperature and zooplankton abundance in the NE Atlantic". ''Oceanol. Acta '' '''3''', 145-149&lt;/ref&gt; constructed a measure of the latitude of the current, the Gulf Stream south wall (GSNW) index by extracting and analysing time-series of the [[latitude]] at six [[longitudes]] between 79°W and 65°W, a series of data that continues to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A.H. (2011). ''The Dance of Air and Sea: How Oceans, Weather and Life Link Together''. Oxford University Press, 288 pp&lt;/ref&gt; There have been other subsequent studies. In 1994, Drinkwater et al. examined the latitude of the north wall from the 1970s to 1992 at each degree of longitude from 50 to 75°W,&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater, K.F., Myers, R.A., Pettipas, R.G. and Wright, T.L. (1994). "Climatic data for the northwest Atlantic: the position of the shelf / slope front and the northern boundary of the Gulf stream between 50°W and 75°W, 1973–1992". ''Can. Data Rep. Hydrogr. Ocean Sci''., '''125''', 103p&lt;/ref&gt; and Miller analysed the onshore/offshore position of the north wall at 10 cross-[[isobath]] [[transects]] equally spaced between 75 and 80°W from 1976 to 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J.L. (1994). "Fluctuations of Gulf Stream frontal position between Cape Hatteras and the Straits of Florida". ''J. Geophys. Res.'' '''99(C3),''' 5057-5064&lt;/ref&gt; Gangopadhyay et al. have derived a ten-year time series of the latitude of the separation of the Gulf Stream from the 1970s to the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Gangopadhyay A., Cornillon P., Watts R.D. (1992). "A test of the Parsons-Veronis hypothesis on the separation of the Gulf Stream". ''Journal of Physical Oceanography'', '''22''', 1286-1301&lt;/ref&gt; By applying [[empirical orthogonal function]] analysis to temperatures at 200 metres, Joyce et al. in 2001 constructed a similar index to the GSNW index extending back to the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, T.M., C. Deser and M.A. Spall. (2000). "On the relation between decadal variability of subtropical Mode Water and the North Atlantic Oscillation", ''J. Climate'', '''13''', 2550-2569&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction of the index==
Monthly charts of the Gulf Stream have been published by the US Naval Oceanographic in "’Gulf Stream Monthly Summary" from 1966 to 1974, and by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in "Gulf Stream’’ from 1975 to 1980 and "Oceanographic Monthly Summary" from 1981 until 1994. Later charts have been obtained from the US Navy. Each chart gives a snap-shot of the currents path at the end of the month. The monthly charts were analysed by the procedure described in Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor A.H. (1996). "North-south shifts of the Gulf Stream: ocean-atmosphere interactions in the North Atlantic". ''International Journal of Climatology'', '''16''', 559-583&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor A.H. (1995). "North-south shifts of the Gulf Stream and their climatic connection with the abundance of zooplankton in the UK and its surrounding seas". ''ICES Journal of Marine Science'', '''52''', 711-721&lt;/ref&gt;

The latitude of the north wall was read from each chart at each of the six longitudes: 79, 75, 72, 70, 67 and 65°W. [[Principal components analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, M.G. and Stuart, A. (1966). ''The Advanced Theory of Statistics'', vol. 3, Charles Griffin and Company Ltd, London, 552 pp&lt;/ref&gt; was then used to find the pattern of variation common to the six longitudes. This is preferable to simple averaging of the six latitude estimates which would emphasise the eastern longitudes where the north-south movements are largest, and possibly obscure smaller but coherent north-south shifts further west. Correlation coefficients are calculated between the six time-series and the principal components are the eigenvectors of the resulting correlation matrix. (Empirical orthogonal function analysis proceeds instead from the variance-covariance matrix which again is biased to the eastern longitudes.)

Each principal component is calculated as a weighted average of the standardised latitude series using weightings that can be expressed as correlation coefficients between the components and the original series. The first principal component of the position of the north wall has positive correlation coefficients of about 0.5 with the latitude of the north wall at each of the six longitudes from 79°W to 65°W, respectively, and therefore represents displacements of this whole section of the Gulf Stream. Seasonal changes in the position are relatively small and so this principal component is virtually indistinguishable from that obtained if the annual cycle is removed beforehand.

Because each monthly chart gives the path of the current on one particular day, the monthly positions are strongly influenced by short period meandering of the Stream. Only annual values of the index which average out this variability can be meaningfully used to look at long-term changes.&lt;ref&gt;The GSNW index data is available at www.pml.ac.uk/gulfstream&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of the index==
Curry ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, R.G., McCartney, M.S. and Joyce, T.M. (1998). "Oceanic transport of subpolar climate signals to mid-depth subtropical waters". ''Nature'', '''391''', 575-577&lt;/ref&gt; have used the potential energy anomaly difference between the Labrador Sea and Bermuda as a measure of the transport of the Gulf Stream system. Curry and McCartney&lt;ref&gt;Curry, R.G. &amp; McCartney, M.S. (2001). "Ocean gyre circulation changes associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation". ''J. Phys. Oceanogr''., '''31''', 3374-3400&lt;/ref&gt; have pointed out their index correlates well with the latitude of the north wall. The GSNW index is therefore a measure of changes in the large-scale [[ocean currents]].

The latitude of the north wall in any year, as described in the GSNW index, is a delayed response to atmospheric changes over the North Atlantic Ocean, and especially to the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]] (NAO). Gangopadhyay ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;Gangopadhyay A., Cornillon P., Watts R.D. (1992). "A test of the Parsons-Veronis hypothesis on the separation of the Gulf Stream". ''Journal of Physical Oceanography'', '''22''', 1286-1301&lt;/ref&gt; found that the point of separation of the Gulf Stream from the US coast was determined by the wind patterns across the ocean two or three years earlier, which they attributed to the passage of Rossby waves across the ocean. The GSNW index has been observed to follow the North Atlantic Oscillation with a lag of two years&lt;ref&gt;Taylor A.H., Stephens J.A. (1998). "The North Atlantic Oscillation and the latitude of the Gulf Stream". ''Tellus'', '''50A''', 134-142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hameed, S. and Piontkovski, S. (2004). The dominant influence of the Icelandic Low on the position of the Gulf Stream northwall. ''Geophysical Research Letters'', '''31''', L09303, {{doi|10.1029/2004GL015561}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which is in agreement with&lt;ref&gt;Curry, R.G. &amp; McCartney, M.S. (2001). "Ocean gyre circulation changes associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation". ''J. Phys. Oceanogr''., '''31''', 3374-3400&lt;/ref&gt; (but Joyce ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, T.M., C. Deser and M.A. Spall. (2000). "On the relation between decadal variability of subtropical Mode Water and the North Atlantic Oscillation", ''J. Climate'', '''13''', 2550-2569&lt;/ref&gt; reported a shorter delay). Hameed and Piontkovski have shown the index seems to be most sensitive to the Iceland Low.&lt;ref&gt;Hameed, S. and Piontkovski, S. (2004). The dominant influence of the Icelandic Low on the position of the Gulf Stream northwall. ''Geophysical Research Letters'', '''31''', L09303, {{doi|10.1029/2004GL015561}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor and Gangopadhyay&lt;ref&gt;Taylor A.H., Gangopadhyay A. (2001). "A simple model of interannual displacements of the Gulf Stream". ''Journal of Geophysical Research'', '''106(C7),''' 13849-13860&lt;/ref&gt; have used a simple model developed by Behringer, Regier and Stommel&lt;ref&gt;Behringer, D., L. Regier and H. Stommel. (1979). "Thermal feedback on wind-stress as a contributing cause of the Gulf Stream", ''J. Mar. Res''., '''37''', 699-709&lt;/ref&gt; to predict the latitude of the Gulf Stream on the basis of the NAO (see Fig. 1). This model has also been tested using data from a coupled ocean-atmosphere model.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A.H. (2011). '' The Dance of Air and Sea: How Oceans, Weather and Life Link Together''. Oxford University Press, 288 pp&lt;/ref&gt; The latitude of the Gulf Stream is also affected by the [[El Nino-Southern Oscillation]] in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor A.H., Jordan M.B., Stephens J.A.

==Teleconnections across the North Atlantic==
The latitude of the north wall has been linked via the atmospheric circulation with a variety of changes at the other side of the North Atlantic Ocean [17], [19], [20],&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A.H. (2011). ''The Dance of Air and Sea: How Oceans, Weather and Life Link Together''. Oxford University Press, 288 pp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Planque B. and Taylor A.H. (1998).

North Atlantic climatic signals and the plankton of the European Continental Shelf, ''Large Marine Ecosystems of the North Atlantic: Changing States and Sustainability'' ed. by K. Sherman and H.R. Skjoldal., 3-26&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Continuous Plankton Recorder]] Survey, now run by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science in Plymouth, UK, has monitored the [[plankton]] in the surface waters of the North Sea and NE Atlantic for more than half a century. Over most of this time many of the [[zooplankton]] in these regions have gone up and down in abundance as the Gulf Stream has shifted north or south,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A.H. and Stephens, J.A. (1980).

''ICES Journal of Marine Science'', '''52''', 711-721&lt;/ref&gt; a relationship that has been seen most clearly in the abundance of [[copepods]]. The link with the current has also been reported in the zooplankton off the Northumberland coast of the UK studied by the [[Dove Marine Laboratory]] of [[Newcastle University]].&lt;ref&gt;Frid C.L.J., Huliselan N.V. (1996). "Far-field control of long-term changes in Northumberland (NW North Sea) coastal zooplankton". ''ICES Journal of Marine Science'', '''53(6)''', 972-977&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions between the individual constituents of the ecosystem appear to have been bringing out a signal weakly expressed throughout the meteorological variables. This process which has been reproduced using an [[ecosystem model]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A.H., Allen, J.I. and Clark, P.A. (2002). "Extraction of a weak climatic signal by an ecosystem". ''Nature'', '''416''', 629-632&lt;/ref&gt; Further afield, the GSNW index has been used to forecast temperatures in the [[Barents Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Ottersen, G., &amp;Aring;dlandsvik, B and Loeng, H. (2000). "Predicting the temperature of the Barents Sea". ''Fisheries Oceanography'', '''9(2)''', 121-135&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect has also been seen in non-marine ecosystems. The numbers of ''[[Daphnia]]'' in two lakes of the [[English Lake District]], [[Windermere]] and [[Esthwaite Water]], have observed to go down when the Gulf Stream is northward (and up when it is southward),.&lt;ref&gt;George D.G. and Taylor A.H. (1995). "UK lake plankton and the Gulf Stream". ''Nature'', '''378''', 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George, D.G. (2000). "The impact of regional-scale changes in the weather on long-term dynamics of Eudaptomus and Daphnia in Esthwaite Water, Cumbria". ''Freshwat. Biol''., '''45''', 111-121&lt;/ref&gt; This is the reverse of the marine relationship, a difference that can be attributed to the influence of the timing and intensity of thermal [[lake stratification]] on the seasonal dynamics of the zooplankton.&lt;ref&gt;George, D.G. &amp; Harris, G.P. (1985). "The effect of climate on long-term changes in the crustacean zooplankton biomass of Lake Windermere, UK". ''Nature'', '''316''', 536-539&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship of thermal stratification to the GSNW index has been replicated in a model.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A.H., Prestidge, M.C. and Allen, J.I. (1996). "Modelling seasonal and year-to-year changes in the ecosystems of the NE Atlantic Ocean and the European Shelf Seas." ''J. Adv. Mar. Sci.Tech. Soc. (Japan)'', '''2''', 133-150&lt;/ref&gt; Jennings and Allott have reported a positive relationship between winter nitrate concentrations in two lakes in SW Ireland and the latitudinal position of the Gulf Stream in the previous spring.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, E. and Allott, N. (2006). "Position of the Gulf Stream influences nitrate concentrations in SW Ireland." ''Aquatic Sciences'', '''68''', 482-489&lt;/ref&gt; The long-distance association with the position of the Gulf Stream has also been reported in a long-running series of observations of wild plants along a roadside in the English [[Cotswolds]].&lt;ref&gt;Willis, A.J., Dunnett, N.P., Hunt, R. and Grime, J.P. (1995). "Does Gulf Stream position affect vegetation dynamics in Western Europe?" '' Oikos'', '''73''', 408-410&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Local Nature Reserve]]s (LNRs) are designated by local authorities under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]]. The local authority must have a legal control over the site, by owning or leasing it, or having a legal agreement with the owner. LNRs are sites which have a special local interest either biologically or geologically, and local authorities have a duty to care for them. They can apply local [[Byelaws in the United Kingdom|bye-laws]] to manage and protect LNRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/protected-or-designated-areas|title=Protected or designated areas|date=9 April 2013|publisher=Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs and Natural England|accessdate=29 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504145328/https://www.gov.uk/protected-or-designated-areas|archivedate=4 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/create-and-manage-local-nature-reserves|title=Local nature reserves: setting up and management|date=2 October 2014|publisher=Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs and Natural England|accessdate=29 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704111109/https://www.gov.uk/create-and-manage-local-nature-reserves|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">These are the main [[river]]s of [[Belgium]].

All of Belgium is drained into the [[North Sea]], except the municipality of [[Momignies]] (Macquenoise), which is drained by the river [[Oise (river)|Oise]] into the [[English Channel]]. Rivers that flow into the sea are sorted alphabetically. Rivers that flow into other rivers are sorted by the proximity of their points of confluence to the sea. Some rivers (e.g. Moselle, Rhine, Seine) do not flow through Belgium themselves, but they are mentioned for having Belgian tributaries. They are given in ''italics''. Below, the Belgian rivers are given alphabetically. See also [[:Category:Rivers of Belgium]]. If the names are different in French, Dutch or German, they are given in parentheses (only given if the river comes into French, Dutch or German-speaking territory). 
 
Note for additions: Please remember to add the city where the river meets for each river. For an alphabetical overview of rivers of Belgium, see the category [[:Category:Rivers of Belgium]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6441">These are the main [[river]]s of the Netherlands.

All of the Netherlands is drained into the [[North Sea]], partly via the [[IJsselmeer]] lake. In the list below, rivers that flow into the sea are sorted following the North Sea coast (including IJsselmeer) from the Belgian border near [[Knokke]] to the German border near [[Emden]]. Rivers that flow into other rivers are sorted by the proximity of their points of confluence to the sea.

A large part of the Netherlands is located in the [[Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta]]. The network of rivers is rather complex. The main routes of the rivers Scheldt, Meuse and Rhine are indicated in '''bold'''.

At the end of this article the rivers of the Netherlands are given alphabetically. See also [[:Category:Rivers of the Netherlands]] and [[:Category:Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]].

Note for additions: please remember to add the city where the river meets for each river.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4658">'''Malpai Borderlands''' is a region, or areal feature, along the [[U.S.-Mexico border]] at the [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] state line. It encompasses the extreme southeast corner of Arizona and the southwest corner of New Mexico describe the general vicinity. It includes areas inside the [[U.S. state]]s of Arizona and New Mexico as well as the [[Mexican state]]s of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Sonora]]. 

The lowest elevations in this area are about 3,700 feet in the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge area. Highest elevation is roughly 8,500 feet above mean sea level (AMSL). Mountain ranges generally run north-south. Terrain is described as including desert shrub, Tobosa grassland, [[Ponderosa Pine]] forest, and [[Douglas Fir]]. Some cattle ranching takes place in the region. The [[geomorphic province]]s include Madrean and [[Chihuahuan Desert|Chihuahuan desert]]s.

The name "Malpai", relates to a type of "[[desert pavement]]", formed by wind ([[Eolian processes|eolian]]) processes, and is called [[Malapai (geology)|Malapai]].

==Variant names==
The Borderlands are sometimes referred to by the name of a larger region encompassing Malpai Borderlands: '''Southwest Borderlands'''. The name is sometimes misspelled ''Maipai'' Borderlands. Some references describe it as being inside the Chihuahuan Desert.

==Unofficial extents of the region==
Papers on the region describe geographic features that partly define it. 

The '''United States portion''' of this region probably includes portions of [[Grant County, New Mexico]], [[Hidalgo County, New Mexico]], and [[Cochise County, Arizona]]. Major geographic features of the area include portions of the San Simon, San Bernardino, Animas, and Playas valleys as well as rivers of the same name. Except for [[Arizona]]'s [[San Simon Valley]] and San Simon River, the areas mentioned appear to be entirely south of present-day [[Interstate 10]]. Government reservations in this region include all of [[Coronado National Forest]] (US Forest Service) east of US191 and San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, (US Fish and Wildlife Service). 

In the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Sonora, Mexico|Sonora]], [[Dieciocho de Agosto]], [[Sierra de los Ajos]] (sometimes written Sierra Ajos), [[Agua Prieta]], ''frontera'' (frontier), [[Cañón del Oso]] and [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales]] are mentioned. In the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], the area of [[Janos, Chihuahua|Janos]] is mentioned.

===Variant descriptions===
A fire history report on the region suggests some definitions may include areas as far west as the Huachuca Mountains of Arizona.

==Area under scientific study==
A wide array of individuals and organizations are eyeing competing demands on these lands. The [[United States Forest Service|US Forest Service]], Arizona Geological Survey, [[United States Geological Survey|US Geological Survey]], Natural Resource Conservation Service (formerly Soil Conservation Service), [[University of New Mexico]], The Nature Conservancy, [[New Mexico Department of Fish and Game]], [[University of Arizona]], and [[Coronado National Forest]] have been active in studying the future of the area.

'''Mare Crisium''' (the "'''Sea of Crises'''") is a [[lunar mare]] located in the [[Moon]]'s Crisium basin, just northeast of [[Mare Tranquillitatis]]. The basin is of the [[Lunar geologic timescale|Pre-Imbrian]] period, 4.55 to 3.85 billion years ago.

==Characteristics==

Mare Crisium is {{convert|555|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter,&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web |title=Moon Mare/Maria |publisher=USGS Astrogeology |work=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/SearchResults?target=MOON&amp;featureType=Mare%2C%20maria |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|176000|km2}} in area. It has a very flat floor, with a ring of [[wrinkle ridge]]s (''dorsa'') toward its outer boundaries.  These are [[Dorsa Tetyaev]], [[Dorsum Oppel]], [[Dorsum Termier]], and [[Dorsa Harker]].  The cape-like feature protruding into the southeast of the mare is [[Promontorium Agarum]]. On the western rim of the mare is the [[Palimpsest#Usage in other disciplines|palimpsest]] [[Yerkes (crater)|Yerkes]], and [[Lick (crater)|Lick]] to the southeast is similar. The [[Impact crater|crater]] [[Picard (crater)|Picard]] is located just to the east of Yerkes, and northwest of Picard are the craters [[Peirce (crater)|Peirce]] and [[Swift (lunar crater)|Swift]]. The [[ray system]] of the crater [[Proclus (crater)|Proclus]] overlie the northwestern mare.  [[Mare Anguis]] can be seen northeast of Mare Crisium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

A [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]] (mascon), or gravitational high, was identified in the center of Mare Crisium from Doppler tracking of the five [[Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter]] spacecraft in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.161.3842.680 | title = Mascons: Lunar Mass Concentrations | year = 1968 | author = P.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Names==
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Crisium was named by [[Giovanni Riccioli]], whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.61.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 17th century, Mare Crisium had acquired the name 'Caspian Sea', being labelled as such by [[Thomas Harriot]], [[Pierre Gassendi]] and [[Michael Van Langren]]. Ewen A. Whitaker speculates that it received this name because it occupies roughly the same position on the Moon's face as does the [[Caspian Sea]] on Earth, with respect to [[T and O map|maps of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East]].&lt;ref name= "witaker_p7"&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The English astronomer [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]'s map of ''c''.1600 calls it 'Brittania' after [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref name= "witaker_p7" /&gt;

==Observation and exploration==
Mare Crisium is just visible from Earth with the naked eye as a small dark spot on the edge of the Moon's face.

It is the site of the crash-landing of Soviet [[Luna 15]] probe in 1969. A soil sample from Mare Crisium was successfully brought to Earth on 22 August 1976 by the Soviet lunar mission [[Luna 24]].

The '''Paratethys ocean''', '''Paratethys sea''' or just '''Paratethys''' was a large shallow sea that stretched from the region north of the [[Alps]] over [[Central Europe]] to the [[Aral Sea]] in [[Central Asia]]. The sea was formed during the [[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]] stage of the [[Late Jurassic]] as an extension of the rift that formed the Central [[Atlantic Ocean]] and was isolated during the [[Oligocene]] epoch (about 34 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unil.ch/webdav/site/igp/shared/Research/Geodynamics_-_Stampfli/155.pdf |title=155&amp;nbsp;Ma - Late Oxfordian (an.

During its long existence the Paratethys was at times reconnected with the Tethys or its successors, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] or [[Indian Ocean]]. From the [[Pliocene]] epoch onward (after 5 million years ago), the Paratethys became progressively shallower. Today's [[Black Sea]], [[Caspian Sea]], [[Aral Sea]], [[Lake Urmia]], [[Namak Lake]] and others are remnants of the Paratethys Sea.

==Name and research==
The name Paratethys was first used by [[Vladimir D. Laskarev]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Laskarev, V.}}; '''1924''': "Sur les equivalents du Sarmatien superieur en Serbie". In: Vujević, P. (ed.), ''Recueil de travaux offert à M. Jovan Cvijic par ses amis et collaborateurs''. Drzhavna Shtamparija, Beograd, pp. 73–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Laskarev's definition included only [[fossil]]s and [[stratum|sedimentary strata]] from the sea of the [[Neogene]] [[system (stratigraphy)|system]]. This definition was later adjusted to also include the Oligocene [[series (stratigraphy)|series]]. The existence of a separated water body in these periods was deduced from fossil [[fauna]] (most importantly [[molluscs]], [[fish]] and [[ostracods]]). In periods in which the Paratethys or parts of it were separated from each other or from other oceans, a separate fauna developed which is found in sedimentary deposits. In this way the [[paleogeography|paleogeographical]] development of the Paratethys can be studied.

Sedimentary strata from the Paratethys are difficult to correlate with those from other oceans or seas because at times it was totally separated from them. [[Stratigraphy|Stratigraphers]] of the Paratethys therefore have their own sets of [[stage (stratigraphy)|stratigraphic stages]] which are still used as alternatives for the official [[geologic timescale]] of the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]].

==Paleogeographical development==
[[File:Paratethys vor 17-13 Mio Jahren.png|thumb|left|400px|Paratethys realm at 17–13 mya.]]
The Paratethys spread over a large area in Central Europe and western Asia. In the west it included in some stages the [[Molasse basin]] north of the [[Alps]]; further east the [[Vienna Basin]] and the [[Pannonian Basin]]; the basin of the current Black Sea; and from there it spread eastward until the current position of the Aral Sea.

During the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods, this part of Eurasia was covered by shallow seas that formed the northern margins of the Tethys Ocean. However, because Anatolia, the southern boundary of the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Paleo-Tethys]], is a part of the original Cimmerian continent, the last remnant of Paleo-Tethys Ocean might be oceanic crust under the Black Sea. The Tethys Ocean formed between [[Laurasia]] (Eurasia and North America) and [[Gondwana]] (Africa, India, Antarctica, Australia and South America) when the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangea]] broke up during the [[Triassic]] (200 million years ago).

The boundary between the [[Eocene]] and Oligocene epochs was characterized by a big drop of the global ([[eustasy|eustatic]]) sea level and a sudden steep cooling of global climates. At the same time the [[Alpine orogeny]], a [[tectonic]] phase by which the Alps, [[Carpathians]], [[Dinarides]], [[Taurus mountains|Taurus]], [[Elburz]] and many other [[mountain chain]]s along the southern rim of Eurasia were formed. The combination of a drop in sea level and tectonic uplift resulted in a large [[Marine regression|regression]] of the sea and a barrier was formed between the Tethys and Paratethys domains. Connections with the [[Arctic Ocean]] (the [[Turgai Sea]]), the [[North Sea Basin]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]] (in the form of a [[strait]] north of the Carpathians) also closed in the Early Oligocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Schulz, H.-M.; Vakarcs, G. &amp; Magyar, I.}}; '''2005''': ''The birth of the Paratethys during the Early Oligocene: From Tethys to an ancient Black Sea analogue?'', Global and Planetary Change '''49(3–4)''', pp. 163–176.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible connections with the [[Rhônegraben]] (and the Mediterranean) and the [[Hessen Strait]] (that connected the Molasse Basin with the North Sea Basin) still kept open.

The Early [[Miocene]] (around 20 million years ago) saw a phase of [[marine transgression]]. During this period the Paratethys was well connected with the Mediterranean again. This trend was reversed halfway in the Miocene, and parts of the Paratethys were often separated from each other. When the Mediterranean fell dry during the [[Messinian salinity crisis]] (about 6 million years ago) there were phases when Paratethys water flowed into the dry Mediterranean basins. During the [[Pliocene]] epoch (5.33 to 2.58 million years ago) the former Paratethys was divided in a couple of inland seas that were at times completely separated from each other. An example was the [[Pannonian Sea]], a [[brackish water|brackish]] sea in the [[Pannonian Basin]]. Many of these would disappear before the start of the [[Pleistocene]]. At present, only the Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Aral Sea remain of what was once a vast inland sea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2036">In [[metaphysics]], '''particulars''' are defined as concrete, spatiotemporal entities as opposed to abstract entities, such as properties or numbers. There are, however, theories of ''[[abstract particulars]]'' or ''[[Trope theory|tropes]]''. For example, [[Socrates]] is a particular (there's only one Socrates-the-teacher-of-Plato and one cannot make copies of him, e.g., by cloning him, without introducing new, distinct particulars). Redness, by contrast, is not a particular, because it is abstract and multiply instantiated (for example a bicycle, an apple, and a given woman's hair can all be red).

==Overview==
[[Sybil Wolfram]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Sybil Wolfram]], ''Philosophical Logic'', Routledge, London and New York, 1989, {{ISBN|0-415-02317-3}}, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt; writes &lt;blockquote&gt;
Particulars include only individuals of a certain kind: as a first approximation individuals with a definite place in space and time, such as persons and material objects or events, or which must be identified through such individuals, like smiles or thoughts.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some terms are used by philosophers with a rough-and-ready idea of their meaning. This can occur if there is lack of agreement about the best definition of the term. In formulating a solution to the [[problem of universals]], the term 'particular' can be used to describe the ''particular'' instance of redness of a certain apple as opposed to the 'universal' 'redness' (being [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]]).

The term particular is also used as a modern equivalent of the Aristotelian notion of individual substance. Used in this sense, particular can mean any concrete (individual) entity, irrespective of whether it is spatial and temporal or not.

Its task is to make sure that the electrical system is safe and efficient. If the [[power consumption]] is larger than the power production capacity, [[load shedding]] is used to avoid blackout.

The marine Power Management System PMS is a complete switchboard and generator control system to synchronize the auxiliary engines of the ships by implementing automatic load sharing and optimizing the efficiency of the power plant. It handles various configurations of generators driven by diesel engine, steam turbine and main engine in combination with switchboards of various complexity.

Furthermore, it will be sufficient to start the largest motor of the ship without causing any other motor to stop or having any adverse effect on other equipment in operation. In general a PMS Power Management System performs the following functions on a Ship:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.selmacontrol.com/power-management-system-pms Power Management System PMS]'', SELMA Power Management System PMS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://new.abb.com/marine/systems-and-solutions/automation-and-marinesoftware/integrated-automation|title=Integrated Automation System|last=|first=|date=7 August 2017|website=ABB Marine|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MAXIMATOR-High-Pressure-Manometer-01a.jpg|thumb|Example of the widely used Bourdon pressure gauge]]

'''Pressure measurement''' is the analysis of an applied [[force]] by a [[fluid]] ([[liquid]] or [[gas]]) on a surface. [[Pressure]] is typically measured in units of force per unit of surface area. Many techniques have been developed for the measurement of pressure and [[vacuum]]. Instruments used to measure and display pressure in an integral unit are called '''pressure gauges''' or '''vacuum gauges'''. A '''manometer''' (not to be confused with [[nanometer]]) is a good example, as it uses a column of liquid to both measure and indicate pressure. Likewise the widely used Bourdon gauge is a mechanical device, which both measures and indicates and is probably the best known type of gauge.

A vacuum gauge is a pressure gauge used to measure pressures lower than the ambient atmospheric pressure, which is set as the zero point, in negative values (e.g.: −15&amp;nbsp;[[psig]] or −760&amp;nbsp;[[mmHg]] equals total vacuum). Most gauges measure pressure relative to atmospheric pressure as the zero point, so this form of reading is simply referred to as "gauge pressure". However, anything greater than total vacuum is technically a form of pressure. For very accurate readings, especially at very low pressures, a gauge that uses total vacuum as the zero point may be used, giving pressure readings in an [[absolute scale]].

Other methods of pressure measurement involve sensors that can transmit the pressure reading to a remote indicator or control system ([[telemetry]]).

==Absolute, gauge and differential pressures — zero reference==
{{Anchor|Absolute|Gauge|Differential|Absolute, gauge and differential}}
Everyday pressure measurements, such as for vehicle tire pressure, are usually made relative to ambient air pressure. In other cases measurements are made relative to a vacuum or to some other specific reference. When distinguishing between these zero references, the following terms are used:
*'''{{visible anchor|Absolute pressure}}''' is zero-referenced against a perfect vacuum, using an [[absolute scale]], so it is equal to gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure.
*'''{{visible anchor|Gauge pressure}}''' is zero-referenced against ambient air pressure, so it is equal to absolute pressure minus atmospheric pressure. Negative signs are usually omitted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} To distinguish a negative pressure, the value may be appended with the word "vacuum" or the gauge may be labeled a "vacuum gauge". These are further divided into two subcategories: high and low vacuum (and sometimes [[ultra-high vacuum]]). The applicable pressure ranges of many of the techniques used to measure vacuums have an overlap. Hence, by combining several different types of gauge, it is possible to measure system pressure continuously from 10&amp;nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mbar.
*'''{{visible anchor|Differential pressure}}''' is the difference in pressure between two points.

The zero reference in use is usually implied by context, and these words are added only when clarification is needed. [[Tire-pressure gauge|Tire pressure]] and [[sphygmomanometer|blood pressure]] are gauge pressures by convention, while [[atmospheric pressure]]s, deep vacuum pressures, and [[altimeter|altimeter pressures]] must be absolute.

For most [[working fluid]]s where a fluid exists in a [[closed system]], gauge pressure measurement prevails. Pressure instruments connected to the system will indicate pressures relative to the current atmospheric pressure. The situation changes when extreme vacuum pressures are measured, then absolute pressures are typically used instead.

Differential pressures are commonly used in industrial process systems. Differential pressure gauges have two inlet ports, each connected to one of the volumes whose pressure is to be monitored.  In effect, such a gauge performs the mathematical operation of subtraction through mechanical means, obviating the need for an operator or control system to watch two separate gauges and determine the difference in readings.

Moderate vacuum pressure readings can be ambiguous without the proper context, as they may represent absolute pressure or gauge pressure without a negative sign. Thus a vacuum of 26&amp;nbsp;inHg gauge is equivalent to an absolute pressure of 30&amp;nbsp;inHg (typical atmospheric pressure) − 26&amp;nbsp;inHg = 4&amp;nbsp;inHg.

Atmospheric pressure is typically about 100&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] at sea level, but is variable with altitude and weather. If the absolute pressure of a fluid stays constant, the gauge pressure of the same fluid will vary as atmospheric pressure changes. For example, when a car drives up a mountain, the (gauge) tire pressure goes up because atmospheric pressure goes down. The absolute pressure in the tire is essentially unchanged.

Using atmospheric pressure as reference is usually signified by a "g" for gauge after the pressure unit, e.g. 70&amp;nbsp;psig, which means that the pressure measured is the total pressure minus [[atmospheric pressure]].  There are two types of gauge reference pressure: vented gauge (vg) and sealed gauge (sg).

A vented-gauge [[pressure transmitter]], for example, allows the outside air pressure to be exposed to the negative side of the pressure-sensing diaphragm, through a vented cable or a hole on the side of the device, so that it always measures the pressure referred to ambient [[barometric pressure]].  Thus a vented-gauge reference [[pressure sensor]] should always read zero pressure when the process pressure connection is held open to the air.

A sealed gauge reference is very similar, except that atmospheric pressure is sealed on the negative side of the diaphragm.  This is usually adopted on high pressure ranges, such as [[hydraulics]], where atmospheric pressure changes will have a negligible effect on the accuracy of the reading, so venting is not necessary.  This also allows some manufacturers to provide secondary pressure containment as an extra precaution for pressure equipment safety if the burst pressure of the primary pressure sensing [[diaphragm seal|diaphragm]] is exceeded.

There is another way of creating a sealed gauge reference, and this is to seal a high [[vacuum]] on the reverse side of the sensing diaphragm.  Then the output signal is offset, so the pressure sensor reads close to zero when measuring atmospheric pressure.

A sealed gauge reference [[pressure transducer]] will never read exactly zero because atmospheric pressure is always changing and the reference in this case is fixed at 1 bar.

To produce an [[absolute pressure sensor]], the manufacturer seals a high vacuum behind the sensing diaphragm. If the process-pressure connection of an absolute-pressure transmitter is open to the air, it will read the actual [[barometric pressure]].

==Units==
{{Pressure Units}}

The [[SI]] unit for pressure is the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa), equal to one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square metre]] (N·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; or kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). This special name for the unit was added in 1971; before that, pressure in SI was expressed in units such as N·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. When indicated, the zero reference is stated in parenthesis following the unit, for example 101 kPa (abs). The [[pounds per square inch|pound per square inch]] (psi) is still in widespread use in the US and Canada, for measuring, for instance, tire pressure. A letter is often appended to the psi unit to indicate the measurement's zero reference; psia for absolute, psig for gauge, psid for differential, although this practice is discouraged by the [[NIST]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html#7.4 NIST]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because pressure was once commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a manometer, pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (''e.g.,'' inches of water). Manometric measurement is the subject of [[pressure head]] calculations. The most common choices for a manometer's fluid are [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's density allows for a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to measure a given pressure. The abbreviation "W.C." or the words "water column" are often printed on gauges and measurements that use water for the manometer.

Fluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely. So measurements in "[[mmHg|millimetres of mercury]]" or "[[inHg|inches of mercury]]" can be converted to SI units as long as attention is paid to the local factors of fluid density and [[Gravity of Earth|gravity]]. Temperature fluctuations change the value of fluid density, while location can affect gravity.

Although no longer preferred, these '''manometric units''' are still encountered in many fields. [[Blood pressure]] is measured in millimetres of mercury (see [[torr]]) in most of the world, [[central venous pressure]] and lung pressures in [[centimetre of water|centimeters of water]] are still common, as in settings for CPAP machines. Natural gas pipeline pressures are measured in [[inch of water|inches of water]], expressed as "inches W.C." [[Scuba diving|Scuba divers]] often use a manometric [[rule of thumb]]: the pressure exerted by ten meters depth of sea water ("10 msw") is approximately equal to one atmosphere. In vacuum systems, the units [[torr]] (millimeter of mercury), [[Micron (disambiguation)|micron]] (micrometer of mercury),&lt;ref&gt;http://vacaero.com/information-resources/vacuum-pump-practice-with-howard-tring/1290-understanding-vacuum-measurement-units.html&lt;/ref&gt; and inch of mercury ([[inHg]]) are most commonly used. Torr and micron usually indicates an absolute pressure, while inHg usually indicates a gauge pressure.

Atmospheric pressures are usually stated using hectopascal (hPa), kilopascal (kPa), millibar (mbar) or atmospheres ([[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]). In American and Canadian engineering, [[Stress (physics)|stress]] is often measured in [[kip (unit)|kip]]. Note that stress is not a true pressure since it is not [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]. In the [[cgs]] system the unit of pressure was the [[barye]] (ba), equal to 1 dyn·cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. In the [[Metre-tonne-second system of units|mts]] system, the unit of  pressure was the [[pieze]], equal to 1 [[sthene]] per square metre.

Many other hybrid units are used such as mmHg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or grams-force/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (sometimes as [[kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] without properly identifying the force units). Using the names kilogram, gram, kilogram-force, or gram-force (or their symbols) as a unit of force is prohibited in SI; the unit of force in SI is the newton (N).

==Static and dynamic pressure==
[[Static pressure]] is uniform in all directions, so pressure measurements are independent of direction in an immovable (static) fluid. Flow, however, applies additional pressure on surfaces perpendicular to the flow direction, while having little impact on surfaces parallel to the flow direction. This directional component of pressure in a moving (dynamic) fluid is called [[dynamic pressure]]. An instrument facing the flow direction measures the sum of the static and dynamic pressures; this measurement is called the [[total pressure]] or [[stagnation pressure]]. Since dynamic pressure is referenced to static pressure, it is neither gauge nor absolute; it is a differential pressure.

While static gauge pressure is of primary importance to determining net loads on pipe walls, dynamic pressure is used to measure flow rates and airspeed. Dynamic pressure can be measured by taking the differential pressure between instruments parallel and perpendicular to the flow. [[Pitot tube|Pitot-static tube]]s, for example perform this measurement on airplanes to determine airspeed. The presence of the measuring instrument inevitably acts to divert flow and create turbulence, so its shape is critical to accuracy and the calibration curves are often non-linear.

===Applications===
*[[Altimeter]]
*[[Barometer]]
*[[MAP sensor]]
*[[Pitot tube]]
*[[Sphygmomanometer]]

==Instruments==
Many instruments have been invented to measure pressure, with different advantages and disadvantages. Pressure range, sensitivity, dynamic response and cost all vary by several orders of magnitude from one instrument design to the next. The oldest type is the liquid column (a vertical tube filled with mercury) manometer invented by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643.  The U-Tube was invented by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1661.

===Hydrostatic===
'''Hydrostatic''' gauges (such as the mercury column manometer) compare pressure to the hydrostatic force per unit area at the base of a column of fluid. Hydrostatic gauge measurements are independent of the type of gas being measured, and can be designed to have a very linear calibration. They have poor dynamic response.

====Piston====
Piston-type gauges counterbalance the pressure of a fluid with a spring (for example [[tire-pressure gauge]]s of comparatively low accuracy) or a solid weight, in which case it is known as a [[deadweight tester]] and may be used for calibration of other gauges.

====Liquid column (manometer)====
[[Image:Utube.PNG|thumb|upright|The difference in fluid height in a liquid-column manometer is proportional to the pressure difference: &lt;math&gt;h = \frac{P_a - P_o}{g \rho}&lt;/math&gt;]]
Liquid-column gauges consist of a column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures. The column will rise or fall until its weight (a force applied due to gravity) is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube (a force applied due to fluid pressure). A very simple version is a U-shaped tube half-full of liquid, one side of which is connected to the region of interest while the [[reference]] pressure (which might be the [[atmospheric pressure]] or a vacuum) is applied to the other. The difference in liquid levels represents the applied pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of fluid of height ''h'' and density ''ρ'' is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation, ''P'' = ''hgρ''. Therefore, the pressure difference between the applied pressure ''P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the reference pressure ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in a U-tube manometer can be found by solving {{nowrap|''P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''hgρ''}}. In other words, the pressure on either end of the liquid (shown in blue in the figure) must be balanced (since the liquid is static), and so {{nowrap|''P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}}  ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''hgρ''}}.

In most liquid-column measurements, the result of the measurement is the height ''h'', expressed typically in mm, cm, or inches. The ''h'' is also known as the [[pressure head]]. When expressed as a pressure head, pressure is specified in units of length and the measurement fluid must be specified. When accuracy is critical, the temperature of the measurement fluid must likewise be specified, because liquid density is a function of [[temperature]]. So, for example, pressure head might be written "742.2&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sub&gt;Hg&lt;/sub&gt;" or "4.2&amp;nbsp;in&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; at 59&amp;nbsp;°F" for measurements taken with mercury or water as the manometric fluid respectively. The word "gauge" or "vacuum" may be added to such a measurement to distinguish between a pressure above or below the atmospheric pressure. Both mm of mercury and inches of water are common pressure heads, which can be converted to S.I. units of pressure using [[unit conversion]] and the above formulas.

If the fluid being measured is significantly dense, hydrostatic corrections may have to be made for the height between the moving surface of the manometer working fluid and the location where the pressure measurement is desired, except when measuring differential pressure of a fluid (for example, across an [[orifice plate]] or venturi), in which case the density ρ should be corrected by subtracting the density of the fluid being measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Methods for the Measurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes, Part 1. Orifice Plates, Nozzles and Venturi Tubes |date=1964 |publisher=[[British Standards Institute]] |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although any fluid can be used, [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is preferred for its high density (13.534&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and low [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]]. For low pressure differences, light oil or water are commonly used (the latter giving rise to units of measurement such as [[Inch of water|inches water gauge]] and [[Millimeters, water gauge|millimetres H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]. Liquid-column pressure gauges have a highly linear calibration. They have poor dynamic response because the fluid in the column may react slowly to a pressure change.

When measuring vacuum, the working liquid may evaporate and contaminate the vacuum if its [[vapor pressure]] is too high. When measuring liquid pressure, a loop filled with gas or a light fluid can isolate the liquids to prevent them from mixing, but this can be unnecessary, for example, when mercury is used as the manometer fluid to measure differential pressure of a fluid such as water. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from a few [[torr]]s (a few 100&amp;nbsp;Pa) to a few atmospheres (approximately {{val|1,000,000|u=Pa}}).

A single-limb liquid-column manometer has a larger reservoir instead of one side of the U-tube and has a scale beside the narrower column. The column may be inclined to further amplify the liquid movement. Based on the use and structure, following types of manometers are used&lt;ref name=manometer_types&gt;[Was: "fluidengineering.co.nr/Manometer.htm". At 1/2010 that took me to bad link. Types of fluid Manometers]&lt;/ref&gt;

====McLeod gauge====
[[Image:McLeod gauge.jpg|thumb|A McLeod gauge, drained of mercury]]
A [[McLeod gauge]] isolates a sample of gas and compresses it in a modified mercury manometer until the pressure is a few [[Millimeter of mercury|millimetres of mercury]]. The technique is very slow and unsuited to continual monitoring, but is capable of good accuracy. Unlike other manometer gauges, the McLeod gauge reading is dependent on the composition of the gas, since the interpretation relies on the sample compressing as an [[ideal gas]]. Due to the compression process, the McLeod gauge completely ignores partial pressures from non-ideal vapors that condense, such as pump oils, mercury, and even water if compressed enough.

0.1&amp;nbsp;mPa is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-dependent properties. These indirect measurements must be calibrated to SI units by a direct measurement, most commonly a McLeod gauge.&lt;ref name=measure&gt;{{Cite book | first=Thomas G. | last=Beckwith | author2=Roy D.

===Aneroid===
'''Aneroid''' gauges are based on a metallic pressure-sensing element that flexes elastically under the effect of a pressure difference across the element. "Aneroid" means "without fluid", and the term originally distinguished these gauges from the hydrostatic gauges described above. However, aneroid gauges can be used to measure the pressure of a liquid as well as a gas, and they are not the only type of gauge that can operate without fluid. For this reason, they are often called '''mechanical''' gauges in modern language. Aneroid gauges are not dependent on the type of gas being measured, unlike thermal and ionization gauges, and are less likely to contaminate the system than hydrostatic gauges. The pressure sensing element may be a '''Bourdon tube''', a diaphragm, a capsule, or a set of bellows, which will change shape in response to the pressure of the region in question. The deflection of the pressure sensing element may be read by a linkage connected to a needle, or it may be read by a secondary transducer. The most common secondary transducers in modern vacuum gauges measure a change in capacitance due to the mechanical deflection. Gauges that rely on a change in capacitance are often referred to as capacitance manometers.

====Bourdon gauge====

[[Image:Manometer 104026.jpg|right|thumb|Membrane-type manometer]]
The Bourdon pressure gauge uses the principle that a flattened tube tends to straighten or regain its circular form in cross-section when pressurized. This change in cross-section may be hardly noticeable, involving moderate [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]es within the elastic range of easily workable materials. The [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] of the material of the tube is magnified by forming the tube into a C shape or even a helix, such that the entire tube tends to straighten out or uncoil elastically as it is pressurized. [[Eugène Bourdon]] patented his gauge in France in 1849, and it was widely adopted because of its superior sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy; Edward Ashcroft purchased Bourdon's American patent rights in 1852 and became a major manufacturer of gauges.  Also in 1849, Bernard Schaeffer in Magdeburg, Germany patented a successful diaphragm (see below) pressure gauge, which, together with the Bourdon gauge, revolutionized pressure measurement in industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivingindustry.com/Indicator/discspring.htm  ''The Engine Indicator'' Canadian Museum of Making]&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1875 after Bourdon's patents expired, his company [[Budenberg Gauge Company|Schaeffer and Budenberg]] also manufactured Bourdon tube gauges.

[[File:E Bourdons Patent Compound Gauge.jpg|thumb|An original 19th century Eugene Bourdon compound gauge, reading pressure both below and above ambient with great sensitivity.]]In practice, a flattened thin-wall, closed-end tube is connected at the hollow end to a fixed pipe containing the fluid pressure to be measured. As the pressure increases, the closed end moves in an arc, and this motion is converted into the rotation of a (segment of a) gear by a connecting link that is usually adjustable. A small-diameter pinion gear is on the pointer shaft, so the motion is magnified further by the [[gear ratio]]. The positioning of the indicator card behind the pointer, the initial pointer shaft position, the linkage length and initial position, all provide means to calibrate the pointer to indicate the desired range of pressure for variations in the behavior of the Bourdon tube itself. Differential pressure can be measured by gauges containing two different Bourdon tubes, with connecting linkages.

Bourdon tubes measure [[gauge pressure]], relative to ambient atmospheric pressure, as opposed to [[absolute pressure]]; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some aneroid barometers use Bourdon tubes closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below).  When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a [[reciprocating pump]], an [[:wikt:orifice|orifice]] restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the pointer and indicator card can be filled with an oil or [[glycerin]]. Tapping on the face of the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the gauge. The Bourdon tube is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of ±2% of span, and a special high-precision gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Boyes |first = Walt |title = Instrumentation Reference Book |edition = Fourth |publisher = [[Butterworth-Heinemann]] |date = 2008 |pages = 1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following illustrations the transparent cover face of the pictured combination pressure and vacuum gauge has been removed and the mechanism removed from the case. This particular gauge is a combination vacuum and pressure gauge used for automotive diagnosis:

Due to the short distance between the lever arm link boss and the pivot pin and the difference between the effective radius of the sector gear and that of the spur gear, any motion of the Bourdon tube is greatly amplified. A small motion of the tube results in a large motion of the indicator needle.
# Hair spring to preload the gear train to eliminate gear lash and [[hysteresis]].

====Diaphragm====
A second type of aneroid gauge uses  [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] of a flexible [[Artificial membrane|membrane]] that separates regions of different pressure. The amount of deflection is repeatable for known pressures so the pressure can be determined by using calibration. The deformation of a thin diaphragm is dependent on the difference in pressure between its two faces.  The reference face can be open to atmosphere to measure gauge pressure, open to a second port to measure differential pressure, or can be sealed against a vacuum or other fixed reference pressure to measure absolute pressure. The deformation can be measured using mechanical, optical or capacitive techniques. Ceramic and metallic diaphragms are used.

====Bellows====
[[Image:Barograph 03.jpg|thumb|A pile of pressure capsules with corrugated diaphragms in an aneroid [[barograph]]]]
In gauges intended to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may be driven by an enclosed and sealed bellows chamber, called an '''aneroid''', which means "without liquid". (Early [[barometer]]s used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal [[mercury (element)|mercury]] suspended by a [[vacuum]].) This bellows configuration is used in aneroid barometers (barometers with an indicating needle and dial card), [[altimeter]]s, altitude recording [[barograph]]s, and the altitude [[telemetry]] instruments used in [[weather balloon]] [[radiosonde]]s. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as [[airspeed indicator|air speed indicators]] and rate of climb indicators ([[variometer]]s) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external enclosing chamber.

====Magnetic coupling====
These gauges use the attraction of two magnets to translate differential pressure into motion of a dial pointer. As differential pressure increases, a magnet attached to either a piston or rubber diaphragm moves. A rotary magnet that is attached to a pointer then moves in unison. To create different pressure ranges, the spring rate can be increased or decreased.

===Spinning-rotor gauge===
The spinning-rotor gauge works by measuring the amount a rotating ball is slowed by the viscosity of the gas being measured.  The ball is made of steel and is magnetically levitated inside a steel tube closed at one end and exposed to the gas to be measured at the other.  The ball is brought up to speed (about 2500&amp;nbsp;[[radian|rad]]/s), and the speed measured after switching off the drive, by electromagnetic transducers.&lt;ref&gt;A. Chambers, ''Basic Vacuum Technology'', pp. 100–102, CRC Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0585254915}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The range of the instrument is 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa with less accuracy).  It is accurate and stable enough to be used as a [[secondary standard]].  The instrument requires some skill and knowledge to use correctly.  Various corrections must be applied and the ball must be spun at a pressure well below the intended measurement pressure for five hours before using.  It is most useful in calibration and research laboratories where high accuracy is required and qualified technicians are available.&lt;ref&gt;John F. O'Hanlon, ''A User's Guide to Vacuum Technology'', pp. 92–94, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005. {{ISBN|0471467154}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic pressure sensors==
{{Main|Pressure sensor}}

; Piezoresistive strain gage
:Uses the [[piezoresistive]] effect of bonded or formed strain gauges to detect strain due to applied pressure.
; Capacitive
:Uses a diaphragm and pressure cavity to create a variable [[capacitor]] to detect strain due to applied pressure.
; Magnetic
:Measures the displacement of a diaphragm by means of changes in [[inductance]] (reluctance), [[LVDT]], [[Hall effect]], or by [[eddy current]] principle.
; Piezoelectric
:Uses the [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] effect in certain materials such as quartz to measure the strain upon the sensing mechanism due to pressure.
; Optical
:Uses the physical change of an optical fiber to detect strain due to applied pressure.
; Potentiometric
:Uses the motion of a wiper along a resistive mechanism to detect the strain caused by applied pressure.
; Resonant
:Uses the changes in [[resonant frequency]] in a sensing mechanism to measure stress, or changes in gas density, caused by applied pressure.

===Thermal conductivity===
Generally, as a [[real gas]] increases in density -which may indicate an increase in [[pressure]]- its ability to conduct heat increases. In this type of gauge, a wire [[Electrical filament|filament]] is heated by running current through it. A [[thermocouple]] or [[resistance thermometer]] (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the [[Pirani gauge]], which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr to 10 [[Torr]], but their calibration is sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.

====Pirani (one wire)====
{{Main|Pirani gauge}}
A [[Pirani gauge]] consist of a metal wire open to the pressure being measured.  The wire is [[Joule heating|heated]] by a current flowing through it and cooled by the gas surrounding it.  If the gas pressure is reduced, the cooling effect will decrease, hence the equilibrium temperature of the wire will increase.  The [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the wire is a [[Electrical resistance#Temperature dependence|function of its temperature]]: by measuring the [[volt]]age across the wire and the [[Electric current|current]] flowing through it, the resistance (and so the gas pressure) can be determined. This type of gauge was invented by [[Marcello Pirani]].

====Two-wire====
In two-wire gauges, one wire coil is used as a heater, and the other is used to measure temperature due to [[convection]]. '''Thermocouple gauges''' and '''thermistor gauges''' work in this manner using [[thermocouple]] or [[thermistor]], respectively, to measure the temperature of the heated wire.

===Ionization gauge===
'''Ionization gauges''' are the most sensitive gauges for very low pressures (also referred to as hard or high vacuum). They sense pressure indirectly by measuring the electrical ions produced when the gas is bombarded with electrons. Fewer ions will be produced by lower density gases. The calibration of an ion gauge is unstable and dependent on the nature of the gases being measured, which is not always known. They can be calibrated against a [[McLeod gauge]] which is much more stable and independent of gas chemistry.

[[Thermionic emission]] generate electrons, which collide with gas atoms and generate positive [[ion]]s.  The ions are attracted to a suitably [[Bias (electrical engineering)|biased]] electrode known as the collector.  The current in the collector is proportional to the rate of ionization, which is a function of the pressure in the system.  Hence, measuring the collector current gives the gas pressure.  There are several sub-types of ionization gauge.
:'''Useful range''': 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; torr (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Pa)

Most ion gauges come in two types: hot [[cathode]] and cold cathode. In the [[Hot-filament ionization gauge|hot cathode]] version, an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr to 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr. The principle behind [[cold cathode]] version is the same, except that electrons are produced in the discharge of a high voltage. Cold Cathode gauges are accurate from 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Torr]] to 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a [[mass spectrometer]] must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Robert M. Besançon | encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Physics | edition=3rd | date=1990 | publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York | isbn = 0-442-00522-9 | pages = 1278–1284 | article=Vacuum Techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hot cathode====
[[Image:Bayard-Alpert gauge.jpg|right|thumb|Bayard–Alpert hot-cathode ionization gauge]]
A [[Hot-filament ionization gauge|hot-cathode ionization gauge]] is composed mainly of three electrodes acting together as a [[triode]], wherein the [[cathode]] is the filament. The three electrodes are a collector or plate, a [[Electrical filament|filament]], and a [[electrical grid|grid]]. The collector current is measured in [[picoampere]]s by an [[electrometer]]. The filament voltage to ground is usually at a potential of 30 volts, while the grid voltage at 180–210 volts DC, unless there is an optional [[electron bombardment]] feature, by heating the grid, which may have a high potential of approximately 565 volts.

The most common ion gauge is the hot-cathode '''Bayard–Alpert gauge''', with a small ion collector inside the grid. A glass envelope with an opening to the vacuum can surround the electrodes, but usually the '''nude gauge''' is inserted in the vacuum chamber directly, the pins being fed through a ceramic plate in the wall of the chamber. Hot-cathode gauges can be damaged or lose their calibration if they are exposed to atmospheric pressure or even low vacuum while hot. The measurements of a hot-cathode ionization gauge are always logarithmic.

Electrons emitted from the filament move several times in back-and-forth movements around the grid before finally entering the grid. During these movements, some electrons collide with a gaseous molecule to form a pair of an ion and an electron ([[electron ionization]]). The number of these [[ions]] is proportional to the gaseous molecule density multiplied by the electron current emitted from the filament, and these ions pour into the collector to form an ion current. Since the gaseous molecule density is proportional to the pressure, the pressure is estimated by measuring the ion current.

The low-pressure sensitivity of hot-cathode gauges is limited by the photoelectric effect. Electrons hitting the grid produce x-rays that produce photoelectric noise in the ion collector. This limits the range of older hot-cathode gauges to 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr and the Bayard–Alpert to about 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr. Additional wires at cathode potential in the line of sight between the ion collector and the grid prevent this effect. In the extraction type the ions are not attracted by a wire, but by an open cone. As the ions cannot decide which part of the cone to hit, they pass through the hole and form an ion beam. This ion beam can be passed on to a:
* [[Faraday cup]]
* [[Microchannel plate detector]] with Faraday cup
* [[Quadrupole mass analyzer]] with Faraday cup
* [[Quadrupole mass analyzer]] with microchannel plate detector and Faraday cup
* [[Ion len]]s and acceleration voltage and directed at a target to form a [[sputtering|sputter gun]]. In this case a valve lets gas into the grid-cage.

====Cold cathode====
There are two subtypes of [[Cold cathode|cold-cathode]] ionization gauges: the '''Penning gauge''' (invented by [[Frans Michel Penning]]), and the '''Inverted magnetron''', also called a '''Redhead gauge'''. The major difference between the two is the position of the [[anode]] with respect to the [[cathode]]. Neither has a filament, and each may require a [[direct current|DC]] potential of about 4 [[volt|kV]]  for operation. Inverted magnetrons can measure down to 1{{e|−12}}&amp;nbsp; [[Torr]].

Likewise, cold-cathode gauges may be reluctant to start at very low pressures, in that the near-absence of a gas makes it difficult to establish an electrode current - in particular in Penning gauges, which use an axially symmetric magnetic field to create path lengths for electrons that are of the order of metres. In ambient air, suitable ion-pairs are ubiquitously formed by cosmic radiation; in a Penning gauge, design features are used to  ease the set-up of a discharge path. For example, the electrode of a Penning gauge is usually finely tapered to facilitate the field emission of electrons.

Maintenance cycles of cold cathode gauges are, in general, measured in years, depending on the gas type and pressure that they are operated in. Using a cold cathode gauge in gases with substantial organic components, such as pump oil fractions, can result in the growth of delicate carbon films and shards within the gauge that eventually either short-circuit the electrodes of the gauge or impede the generation of a discharge path.

==Dynamic transients==
When fluid flows are not in equilibrium, local pressures may be higher or lower than the average pressure in a medium. These disturbances propagate from their source as longitudinal pressure variations along the path of propagation. This is also called sound. Sound pressure is the instantaneous local pressure deviation from the average pressure caused by a sound wave. Sound pressure can be measured using a [[microphone]] in air and a [[hydrophone]] in water. The effective sound pressure is the [[root mean square]] of the instantaneous sound pressure over a given interval of time. Sound pressures are normally small and are often expressed in units of microbar.

==Calibration and standards==
[[File:Dead weight tester, Type PD23, Nagano Keiki Co., Ltd. - National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo - DSC07787.JPG|thumb|Dead-weight tester. This uses known calibrated weights on a piston to generate a known pressure.]]

The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has developed two separate and distinct standards on pressure Measurement, B40.100 and PTC 19.2.
B40.100 provides guidelines on Pressure Indicated Dial Type and Pressure Digital Indicating Gauges, Diaphragm Seals, Snubbers, and Pressure Limiter Valves.
PTC 19.2 provides instructions and guidance for the accurate determination of pressure values in support of the ASME Performance Test Codes. The choice of method, instruments, required calculations, and corrections to be applied depends on the purpose of the measurement, the allowable uncertainty, and the characteristics of the equipment being tested.

The methods for pressure measurement and the protocols used for data transmission are also provided. Guidance is given for setting up the instrumentation and determining the uncertainty of the measurement. Information regarding the instrument type, design, applicable pressure range, accuracy, output, and relative cost is provided. Information is also provided on pressure-measuring devices that are used in field environments i.e., Piston Gauges, Manometers, and Low-Absolute-Pressure (Vacuum) Instruments.

These methods are designed to assist in the evaluation of measurement uncertainty based on current technology and engineering knowledge, taking into account published instrumentation specifications and measurement and application techniques. This Supplement provides guidance in the use of methods to establish the pressure-measurement uncertainty.

'''Puy''' ({{IPA-fr|pɥi}}) is a [[geology|geological]] term used locally in the [[Auvergne (région)|Auvergne]], [[France]] for a [[volcano|volcanic]] [[hill]]. The word derives from the [[Franco-Provençal language|Provençal]] ''puech'', meaning an isolated hill, coming from Latin ''podium'', which has given also ''puig'' in Catalan, ''poggio'' in Italian, ''poio'' in Galician and Portuguese. 

Most of the puys of central France are small [[cinder cone]]s, with or without associated [[lava]], whilst others are domes of [[trachyte|trachytic]] rock, like the {{ill|domite|fr||it}} of the [[Puy-de-Dôme (mountain)|Puy-de-Dôme]]. The puys may be scattered as isolated hills, or, as is more usual, clustered together, sometimes in lines. The chain of puys in central France probably became extinct in late prehistoric time.

Other volcanic hills more or less like those of Auvergne are also known to geologists as puys; examples may be found in the [[Eifel]] and in the small cones on the [[Bay of Naples]], whilst the relics of puys denuded by erosion are numerous in the [[Swabian Alps]] of [[Württemberg]], as pointed out by [[Wilhelm von Branca|W. Branco]]. Sir [[Archibald Geikie|A. Geikie]] has shown that the puy type of eruption was common in the British area in [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] times, as abundantly attested in central [[Scotland]] by remains of the old volcanoes, now generally reduced by [[denudation]] to the mere neck, or volcanic vent, filled with [[tuff]] and [[agglomerate]], or plugged with lava.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4049">The '''quantum yield (Φ)''' of a [[radiation]]-induced process is the number of times a specific event occurs per [[photon]] absorbed by the system. The "event" is typically a kind of [[chemical reaction]].

==Applications==
The quantum yield for the decomposition of a reactant molecule in a [[chemical decomposition|decomposition reaction]] is defined as:
::&lt;math&gt; \Phi = \frac{\rm \#\ molecules \ decomposed} {\rm \#\ photons \ absorbed} &lt;/math&gt;

Quantum yield can also be defined for other events, such as [[fluorescence]]:&lt;ref name=Lakowicz&gt;Lakowicz, Joseph R. ''Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy'' (Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers 1999) p.10. {{ISBN|978-0-387-31278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \Phi = \frac {\rm \#\ photons \ emitted} {\rm \#\ photons \ absorbed} &lt;/math&gt;
Here, quantum yield is the emission efficiency of a given [[fluorophore]].

== Examples ==
Quantum yield is used in modeling [[photosynthesis]]:&lt;ref name="pmid18359752"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Skillman JB | title = Quantum yield variation across the three pathways of photosynthesis: not yet out of the dark | journal = [[Journal of Experimental Botany|J. Exp. Bot.]] | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1647–61 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18359752 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/ern029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \Phi = \frac {\rm \mu mol\ CO_2 \ fixed} {\rm \mu mol\ photons \ absorbed} &lt;/math&gt;

In a chemical [[photodegradation]] process, when a molecule dissociates after absorbing a light [[quantum]], the quantum yield is the number of destroyed molecules divided by the number of photons absorbed by the system. Since not all photons are absorbed productively, the typical quantum yield will be less than 1.

Quantum yields greater than 1 are possible for photo-induced or radiation-induced [[Chain reaction#Chemical chain reactions|chain reactions]], in which a single photon may trigger a long [[Chain reaction|chain of transformations]]. One example is the reaction of [[hydrogen]] with [[chlorine]], in which as many as 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; molecules of [[hydrogen chloride]] can be formed per quantum of blue light absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith J. Laidler|Laidler K.J.]], ''Chemical Kinetics'' (3rd ed., Harper &amp; Row 1987) p.289  {{ISBN|0-06-043862-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[optical spectroscopy]], the quantum yield is the probability that a given quantum state is formed from the system initially prepared in some other quantum state. For example, a [[NMR spectroscopy|singlet]] to [[Spin triplet|triplet]] transition quantum yield is the fraction of molecules that, after being photoexcited into a singlet state, cross over to the triplet state.

The '''fluorescence quantum yield''' is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.&lt;ref name=Lakowicz/&gt; Experimentally, relative fluorescence quantum yields can be determined by measuring fluorescence of a fluorophore of known quantum yield with the same experimental parameters (excitation [[wavelength]], slit widths, [[photomultiplier]] voltage etc.) as the substance in question. The quantum yield is then calculated by:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \Phi_\mathrm{R}\times\frac{\mathit{Int}}{\mathit{Int}_\mathrm{R}}\frac{1-10^{-A_\mathrm{R}}}{1-10^{-A}}\frac{{n}^2}{{n_\mathrm{R}}^2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the quantum yield, '' Int '' is the area under the emission peak (on a wavelength scale), ''A'' is [[absorbance]] (also called "optical density") at the excitation wavelength, and ''n'' is the [[refractive index]] of the [[solvent]]. The subscript R denotes the respective values of the reference substance.&lt;ref&gt;Albert M. Brouwer, [http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/83/12/2213/ Standards for photoluminescence quantum yield measurements in solution] (IUPAC Technical Report), [[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl. Chem.]], Vol. 83, No. 12, pp. 2213–2228, 2011. doi:10.1351/PAC-REP-10-09-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Riparian water rights''' (or simply '''riparian rights''') is a system for allocating water among those who possess land along its path.  It has its origins in English [[common law]].  [[riparian zone|Riparian]] [[water right]]s exist in many jurisdictions with a common law heritage, such as [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and states in the eastern [[United States]].

[[Common land]] ownership can be organized into a '''partition unit''', a corporation consisting of the landowners on the shore that formally owns the water area and determines its use.

== General principle ==
Under the riparian principle, all landowners whose properties adjoin a body of water have the right to make reasonable use of it as it flows through or over their properties.  If there is not enough water to satisfy all users, allotments are generally fixed in proportion to frontage on the water source.  These rights cannot be sold or transferred other than with the adjoining land and only in reasonable quantities associated with that land. The water cannot be transferred out of the [[Drainage basin|watershed]] without due consideration as to the rights of the downstream riparian landowners.

Riparian rights include such things as the right to access for swimming, boating and fishing; the right to wharf out to a point of navigability; the right to erect structures such as docks, piers, and boat lifts; the right to use the water for domestic purposes; the right to accretions caused by water level fluctuations; the right to exclusive use if the waterbody is non-navigable.  Riparian rights also depend upon "reasonable use" as it relates to other riparian owners to ensure that the rights of one riparian owner are weighed fairly and equitably with the rights of adjacent riparian owners.&lt;ref name="Guerin, K. 2003"&gt;{{cite web |last=Guerin |first=K |year=2003 |url=http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/research-policy/wp/2003/03-02 |title=Property Rights and Environmental Policy: A New Zealand Perspective |location=Wellington, New Zealand |publisher=New Zealand Treasury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==
The [[Environment Agency]] lists the riparian rights and duties in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/31626.aspx Living on the Edge] – Environment Agency website, retrieved 10 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights include ownership of the land up to the centre of the watercourse unless it is known to be owned by someone else, the right for water to flow onto land in its natural quantity and quality, the right to protect property from flooding and land from erosion subject to approval by the agency, the right to fish in the watercourse unless the right is sold or leased if an angler has a valid Environment Agency rod licence. They also include the right to acquire accretion and the right to boomage (a fee charge for securing a boom, generally for the retention of logs).

Duties arising from the model include the following:
* Pass on the flow of water without obstruction, pollution or diversion affecting the rights of others.
* Maintain the bed and banks of the watercourse and to clear any debris, whether natural or artificial, to keep any culverts, rubbish screens, weirs and mill gates clear of debris.
* Be responsible for protection of land from flooding and cause no obstructions, temporary or permanent, preventing the free passage of fish.
* Accept flood flows even if caused by inadequate capacity downstream, but there is no duty to improve the drainage capacity of a watercourse.

== United States ==
The United States recognizes two types of water rights. Although use and overlap varies over time and by state, the western arid states generally follow the doctrine of [[Prior-appropriation water rights|prior appropriation]], but water rights for the eastern states follow riparian law.

===Riparian rights===
Under riparian law, water is a public good like the air, sunlight, or wildlife.  It is not "owned" by the government, state or private individual but is rather included as part of the land over which it falls from the sky or then travels along the surface.

In determining the contours of riparian rights, there is a clear distinction between navigable (public) waters and non-navigable waters.  The land below navigable waters is the property of state,&lt;ref&gt;43 USC §&amp;nbsp;1311(A)&lt;/ref&gt; and subject to all the public land laws and in most states public trust rights. Navigable waters are treated as public highways with any exclusive riparian right ending at the [[ordinary high water mark]]. Like a road, any riparian right is subordinate to the public's right to travel on the river, but any public right is subject to nuisance laws and the police power of the state. It is not an individual right or liberty interest.  Because a finding of navigability establishes state versus federal property, navigability for purposes of riverbed title is a federal question determined under federal law.  The states retain the power of defining the scope of the [[public trust]] over navigable waters.&lt;ref&gt;PPL Montana v Montana 132 S.Ct. 1215 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; A non-navigable stream is synonymous with private property, or jointly-owned property if it serves as a boundary.

The state could choose to divest themselves of title to the streambed, but the waters and use of the waters remains subject to the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] which holds an [[easement]] or [[equitable servitude|servitude]], benefiting the federal government for the purpose of regulating commerce on navigable bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;''Borax Consolidated, Ltd. v. City of Los Angeles'', 29 U.S. 10, 56 S. Ct. 23, 80 L.Ed 9 (1935.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasonable use of the water by a riparian owner is subject to the downstream riparian owners 'riparian right' to receive waters undiminished in flow and quality. Since all surface waters eventually flow to the public ocean, federal regulatory authority under the Clean Waters Act, like the Clean Air Act, extends beyond only public (navigable) waters to prevent downstream pollution.

===States' involvement===
Federal courts have long recognized that state laws establish the extent of the riparian and public right. In the case of navigable waters, title goes to the average low water mark. The [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] defined it as the "ordinary low water mark, unaffected by drought; that is, the height of the water at ordinary stages."&lt;ref&gt;''Appeal of York Haven Water &amp; Power Co.'', 212 Pa. 622, 62 A.97 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt; Land below the low water mark on navigable rivers belongs to the state government in the case of the 13 original states.

Lands between the high and low water marks on navigable rivers are subject to the police powers of the states.&lt;ref&gt;(See ''United States v. Pennsylvania Salt Mfg. Co.'', 16 F.2d 476 (E.D. Pa., 1926))&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the original 13 states, upon ratification of the US Constitution, title to these submerged lands remained vested in the several states similar to the public or common roads.

As new lands were acquired by the United States, either by purchase or treaty, title to the highways and the beds of all navigable, or tidal, water bodies became vested in the United States unless they had been validly conveyed into private ownership by the former sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;''McKnight v. Brodell'', 212 F.Supp 45&lt;/ref&gt; During the territorial period, the United States held these title "in trust" for the benefit of the future states that would be carved out of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;''Hymes v. Grimes Company'', 165 F. 2d 323&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the states were to come into the Union on an "[[equal footing]]" with the original 13 states. Under the [[equal footing doctrine]], territorial states are vested with the same sovereign title rights to navigable [[wetlands|submerged lands]] as the original 13 states.&lt;ref&gt;''Pollard v. Hagan'', 44 U.S. 212, 3 How. 212, 11 L.Ed. 565 (1845)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, during the territorial period, the United States could convey certain of these lands under the limited circumstances of promoting commerce.&lt;ref&gt;''Brewer   Elliot Oil and Gas Co. v. U S.'', 260 U.S. 77, 43 S.Ct 60, 67 L.Ed. 140 (1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of lands submerged by navigable waters was resolved by Congress passing the [[Submerged Lands Act]],&lt;ref&gt;43 U.S.C.A. 1301&lt;/ref&gt; which confirmed state title to the beds of all tidal and navigable bodies of water.  While the act conveyed land title to the states,  non-navigable stream beds remained treated like dry lands and contiguous to the adjoining estates.   Waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tides, even if non-navigable, also passed to the states, but the continued ownership and public use of these tidal/marsh lands are based on state laws.

The '''rural–urban fringe''', also known as the '''outskirts''', '''rurban''', '''peri-urban'''  or the '''urban hinterland''', can be described as the "'''landscape interface''' between town and country",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.cfm?Articleid=2803 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311091656/http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.cfm?Articleid=2803 |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or also as the transition zone where urban and rural uses mix and often clash.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Michael. B., Flemming Christiansen, and Malcolm Chapman. (2010) 'Chinese Consumers: The porn Reappraisal'. ''Ethnography'', Sept 2010, 11, 331-357&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it can be viewed as a landscape type in its own right, one forged from an interaction of urban and rural land uses.

== Definition ==

Its definition shifts depending on the global location, but typically in Europe, where urban areas are intensively managed to prevent [[urban sprawl]] and protect agricultural land, the urban fringe will be characterised by certain land uses which have either purposely moved away from the urban area, or require much larger tracts of land. As examples:

* Roads, especially motorways and bypasses
* Waste transfer stations, [[recycling]] facilities and landfill sites
* [[Park and ride]] sites
* Airports
* Large hospitals
* Power, water and sewerage facilities
* Factories
* Large out-of-town shopping facilities, e.g. large supermarkets

Despite these 'urban' uses, the fringe remains largely open, with the majority of the land agricultural, woodland or other rural use. However, the quality of the countryside around urban areas tends to be low, with severance between the area of open land and bad maintained woodlands and hedgerows.

In recent years there has been a growing interest in how the full environmental and social potential of the urban fringe can be unlocked. In England in 2005, the Countryside Agency (now part of [[Natural England]]) together with Groundwork, a community and environmental regeneration body, produced a vision for the 'countryside in and around towns' that sets out ten 'functions' for a multi-functional urban fringe.&lt;ref&gt;http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/105001  Green Infrastructure
and the Urban Fringe: Learning lessons from the Countryside in and Around Towns Programme (Countryside Agency and Groundwork UK, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The realisation of this vision would{{Dubious|date=February 2010}} provide a high-quality environment right on the urban doorstep and provide the adjacent town or city with a host of '[[ecosystem services]]'. It is estimated{{By whom|date=February 2010}} that within England the urban fringe covers as much as 20% of the land area. Such an extensive resource must be managed and used more intelligently and sustainably if the country as a whole is to develop and function sustainably.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the [[United States]] urban areas are defined as contiguous territory having a density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile, though in some areas the density may be as low as 500 per square mile. Urban areas also include the outlying territory of less density if it was connected to the core of the contiguous area by road and is within 2.5 road miles of that core, or within 5 road miles of the core but separated by water or other undevelopable territories. Other territory with a population density of fewer than 1,000 people per square mile is included in the urban fringe if it eliminates an enclave or closes an indentation in the boundary of the urbanized area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/fedreg/fedregv76n164.pdf| title=Urban Area Criteria for the 2010 Census; Notice| author=Department of Commerce - Census Bureau| work=Federal Register| publisher=National Archives and Records Administration| date=August 24, 2011| access-date=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4747">The '''Sauerbrey equation''' was developed by Prof. Dr. Günter Sauerbrey from Tiefenort, Germany, in 1959, while working on his doctoral thesis at the [[Technical University of Berlin]], Germany. It is a method for correlating changes in the oscillation frequency of a [[piezoelectric]] [[crystal]] with the mass deposited on it.  He simultaneously developed a method for measuring the characteristic frequency and its changes by using the crystal as the frequency determining component of an oscillator circuit.  His method continues to be used as the primary tool in [[quartz crystal microbalance]] experiments for conversion of frequency to mass and is valid in nearly all applications.  

The equation is derived by treating the deposited mass as though it were an extension of the thickness of the underlying quartz.&lt;ref name="Sauerbrey"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;ref name="QCM"&gt;QCM100 – Quartz Crystal  Microbalance Theory and Calibration, Stanford Research Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, the mass to frequency correlation (as determined by Sauerbrey’s equation) is largely independent of electrode geometry.  This has the benefit of allowing mass determination without calibration, making the set-up desirable from a cost and time investment standpoint.

The Sauerbrey equation is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = -\frac{2f_0^2}{A \sqrt{ \rho_q \mu_q } }\Delta m&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_q &lt;/math&gt; – [[Shear modulus]] of quartz for AT-cut crystal (&lt;math&gt; \mu_q &lt;/math&gt; = 2.947x10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;)


Because the film is treated as an extension of thickness, Sauerbrey’s equation only applies to systems in which the following three conditions are met: the deposited mass must be rigid, the deposited mass must be distributed evenly and the frequency change &lt;math&gt; \Delta f /f &lt;/math&gt; &lt; 0.05.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Srivastava and P. Sakthivel, J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 19(1),97-100  Jan/Feb 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

If the change in frequency is greater than 5%, that is, &lt;math&gt; \Delta f /f &lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0.05, the Z-match method must be used to determine the change in mass.&lt;ref name="QCM"/&gt;
The formula for the Z-match method is:&lt;ref name="QCM"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta m}{A}\ = \frac{N_q \rho_q}{\pi Z f_L}\tan^{-1} \left [ Z\tan \left ( \pi \frac{f_U-f_L}{f_U} \right ) \right ]  &lt;/math&gt;

Equation 2 – Z-match method

:&lt;math&gt; f_L &lt;/math&gt; – Frequency of loaded crystal (Hz)
:&lt;math&gt; f_U &lt;/math&gt; – Frequency of unloaded crystal, i.e. Resonant frequency (Hz)
:&lt;math&gt; N_q &lt;/math&gt; – Frequency constant for AT-cut quartz crystal (1.668x10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Hz·Å)
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta m &lt;/math&gt; – Mass change (g)
:&lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; – Piezoelectrically active crystal area (Area between electrodes, cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_q &lt;/math&gt; – Density of quartz (&lt;math&gt; \rho_q &lt;/math&gt; = 2.648 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; – Z-Factor of film material &lt;math&gt; = \sqrt{ \left ( \frac{\rho_q\mu_q}{\rho_f\mu_f}\ \right ) } &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_f &lt;/math&gt; – Density of the film (Varies: units are g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt; \mu_q &lt;/math&gt; – Shear modulus of quartz (&lt;math&gt; \mu_q&lt;/math&gt; = 2.947x10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt; \mu_f &lt;/math&gt; – Shear modulus of film (Varies: units are g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;)

== Limitations ==
The Sauerbrey equation was developed for oscillation in air and only applies to rigid masses attached to the crystal. It has been shown that quartz crystal microbalance measurements can be performed in liquid, in which case a [[viscosity]] related decrease in the resonant frequency will be observed:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = { -\ f_0^{3/2} ( \eta_l \rho_l / \pi \rho_q \mu_q )^{1/2} } &lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_l&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the liquid and &lt;math&gt;\eta_l&lt;/math&gt; is the viscosity of the liquid (Kanazawa and Gordon 1985).

'''Silt''' is [[granular material]] of a size between [[sand]] and [[clay]], whose [[mineral]] origin is [[quartz]]&lt;ref&gt;Assallay,A.M.,Rogers,C.D.F.,Smalley,I.J.,Jefferson,I. 1998. Silt: 2-62um,9-4phi. Earth-Science Reviews 45, 61-88&lt;/ref&gt; and [[feldspar]].  Silt may occur as a [[soil]] (often mixed with sand or clay) or as [[sediment]] mixed in [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] with water (also known as a suspended load) and soil in a [[body of water]] such as a river. It may also exist as soil deposited at the bottom of a water body, like [[mudflow]]s from [[landslide]]s. Silt has a moderate [[specific surface area|specific area]] with a typically non-sticky, plastic feel. Silt usually has a floury feel when dry, and a slippery feel when wet. Silt can be visually observed with a hand lens, exhibiting a sparkly appearance.  It also can be felt by the tongue as granular when placed on the front teeth (even when mixed with clay particles).

Silt is created by a variety of physical processes capable of splitting the generally sand-sized quartz crystals of primary rocks by exploiting deficiencies in their [[crystal structure|lattice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Moss |first= A J |authorlink= |author2=Green, P  |year= 1975|title= Sand and silt grains: Predetermination of their formation and properties by microfractures in quartz |journal= Australian Journal of Earth Sciences |volume= 22 |issue= 4 |pages= 485–495|doi= 10.1080/00167617508728913|bibcode = 1975AuJES..22..485M }}&lt;/ref&gt; These involve chemical [[weathering]] of rock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Nahon |first= D |authorlink= |author2=Trompette, R |year= 1982|title= Origin of siltstones:glacial grinding versus weathering |journal= Sedimentology |volume= 29 |issue= |pages= 25–35|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-3091.1982.tb01706.x|bibcode = 1982Sedim..29...25N }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[regolith]], and a number of physical weathering processes such as [[frost shattering]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lautridou |first= J P |authorlink= |author2=Ozouf, J C  |year= 1982|title= Experimental frost shattering: 15 years of research at the Centre de Geomorphologie du CNRS |journal= Progress in Physical Geography |volume= 6 |issue= 2|pages= 215–232|doi= 10.1177/030913338200600202}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[haloclasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Goudie |first= A S |authorlink= |author2=Viles, H A  |year= 1995 |title= The nature and pattern of debris liberated by salt weathering: a laboratory study |journal= [[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]] |volume= 9 |issue= |pages= 95–98|doi= 10.1002/esp.3290090112|bibcode = 1984ESPL....9...95G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main process is [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]] through transport, including [[fluvial]] [[comminution]], [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] [[Attrition (weathering)|attrition]] and [[glacial]] grinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wright |first= J S |authorlink= |author2=Smith, B J |author3=Whalley W B|year= 1998|title= Mechanisms of loess-sized quartz silt production and their relative effectiveness: laboratory simulations |journal= Geomorphology |volume= 45 |issue= |pages= 15–34|doi= 10.1016/S0169-555X(97)00084-6|bibcode = 1998Geomo..23...15W }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in semi-arid environments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Haberlah |first= D |authorlink= |year= 2007 |title= A call for Australian loess |journal= AREA |volume= 39 |issue= 2 |pages= 224–229|doi= 10.1111/j.1475-4762.2007.00730.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; that substantial quantities of silt are produced. Silt is sometimes known as "rock flour" or "stone dust", especially when produced by glacial action. Mineralogically, silt is composed mainly of [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]]. [[Sedimentary rock]] composed mainly of silt is known as [[siltstone]]. [[Liquefaction]] created by a strong earthquake is silt suspended in water that is hydrodynamically forced up from below ground level.

== Grain size criteria ==
In the [[Grain size#Krumbein phi scale|Udden–Wentworth scale]] (due to [[Krumbein]]), silt particles range between 0.0039 and 0.0625&amp;nbsp;mm, larger than [[clay]] but smaller than [[sand]] particles. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]&amp;nbsp;14688 grades silts between 0.002&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.063&amp;nbsp;mm (sub-divided up into three grades fine, medium and coarse 0.002&amp;nbsp;mm to 0.006&amp;nbsp;mm to 0.020&amp;nbsp;mm to 0.063&amp;nbsp;mm). In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, [[Grain size|grains]] of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. Pure silts are not cohesive.  According to the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Agriculture]] Soil Texture Classification system, the sand–silt distinction is made at the 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm particle size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soils.usda.gov/technical/handbook/contents/part618.html#43 |title=Particle Size (618.43) |work=National Soil Survey Handbook Part 618 (42-55) Soil Properties and Qualities |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture - Natural Resource Conservation Service |accessdate=2006-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527111746/http://soils.usda.gov/technical/handbook/contents/part618.html#43 |archivedate=2006-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The USDA system has been adopted by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO). In the [[Unified Soil Classification System]] (USCS) and the [[AASHTO]] Soil Classification system, the sand–silt distinction is made at the 0.075&amp;nbsp;mm particle size (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;material passing the #200&amp;nbsp;[[sieve]]). Silts and clays are distinguished mechanically by their [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]].

== Environmental impacts ==
[[File:Burgwall Jatzke3.jpg|thumb|right|A silted lake located in [[Eichhorst]], [[Germany]]]]
Silt is easily transported in [[water]] or other liquid and is fine enough to be carried long distances by air in the form of [[dust]]. Thick deposits of silty material resulting from deposition by [[aeolian processes]] are often called [[loess]]. Silt and clay contribute to [[turbidity]] in water. Silt is transported by [[stream]]s or by water currents in the [[ocean]]. When silt appears as a pollutant in water the phenomenon is known as [[siltation]].

Silt, deposited by annual floods along the [[Nile River]], created the rich, fertile soil that sustained the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian civilization. Silt deposited by the [[Mississippi River]] throughout the 20th&amp;nbsp;century has decreased due to a system of [[levees]], contributing to the disappearance of protective [[wetlands]] and [[barrier islands]] in the [[Mississippi River Delta|delta]] region surrounding [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In southeast Bangladesh, in the [[Noakhali district]], cross dams were built in the 1960s whereby silt gradually started forming new land called "chars". The district of Noakhali has gained more than {{convert|73|km2|sqmi|0}} of land in the past 50&amp;nbsp;years.

With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began to help develop older chars in the late 1970s, and the effort has since become a multi-agency operation building roads, [[culvert]]s, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some {{convert|100|km2|acre|sigfig=1}} to 21,000&amp;nbsp;families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/openitem.cfm?id%3D1973 |title= Bangladesh fights for survival against climate change|accessdate=October 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212215115/http://www.pulitzercenter.org/openitem.cfm?id=1973 |archivedate=February 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Museum. Dept. of British and Mediaeval Antiquities and Ethnography.&lt;/ref&gt; and is either a wooden or metal slab or bar that is mounted or suspended and struck with a [[percussion mallet|mallet]]. The Simantra has been used by classical composers including [[Iannis Xenakis]] (''[[Persephassa (Xenakis)|Persephassa]]'') and in [[Michael Gordon (composer)|Michael Gordon]]'s ''[http://www.michaelgordonmusic.com/music/timber Timber]'' (2011).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/6683 Dusted Reviews: Michael Gordon - Timber]", ''DustedMagazine.com'' and "[http://epmusic.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/review-michael-gordons-timber/ Review: Michael Gordon’s Timber]", ''Endless Possibilities''.&lt;/ref&gt; A Simantra is rich in [[overtone]]s compared to the bars of percussion instruments such as a [[marimba]] or [[xylophone]], where the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] is primary. The [[timbre|tone]] changes based on how near or far from the nodes the mallets strike the board.

For the history of the instrument, see the much more detailed article for the [[Semantron]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8104">[[File:SIDS map en.svg|thumb|350px|A map of the Small Island Developing States.]]
'''Small Island Developing States''' ('''SIDS''') are a group of small [[island countries]] that tend to share similar [[sustainable development]] challenges, including small but growing populations, limited resources, remoteness, susceptibility to [[natural disaster]]s, vulnerability to external shocks, excessive dependence on [[international trade]], and fragile environments. Their growth and development is also held back by high communication, energy and transportation costs, irregular international transport volumes, disproportionately expensive public administration and [[infrastructure]] due to their small size, and little to no opportunity to create [[economies of scale]].

The SIDS were first recognized as a distinct group of developing countries at the [[Earth Summit (1992)|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in June 1992. The [[Barbados Programme of Action]] was produced in 1994 to assist the SIDS in their sustainable development efforts. The [[United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States]] (UN-OHRLLS) represents this group of states.

==Embracing sustainability==

Many SIDS now recognise the need to move towards low-carbon, [[Climate resilience|climate resilient]] economies, as set out in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) implementation plan for climate change-resilient development. SIDS often rely heavily on imported fossil fuels, spending an ever-larger proportion of their GDP on energy imports.  Renewable technologies have the advantage of providing energy at a lower cost than fossil fuels and making SIDS more sustainable. Barbados has been successful in adopting the use of solar water heaters (SWHs). A 2012 report published by the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]] showed that its SWH industry now boasts over 50,000 installations. These have saved consumers as much as US$137 million since the early 1970s. The report suggested that Barbados's experience could be easily replicated in other SIDS with high fossil fuel imports and abundant sunshine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/resource/cdkn-inside-story-seizing-the-sunshine-barbados-thriving-solar-water-heater-industry/?loclang=en_gb ''Seizing the sunshine – Barbados’ thriving solar water heater industry''], [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], 17 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of SIDS ==
Currently, the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] lists 57 small island developing states. These are broken down into three geographic regions: the [[Caribbean]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Caribbean|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1522|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Pacific]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pacific|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1523|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Africa]], [[Indian Ocean]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[South China Sea]] (AIMS).,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AIMS|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1521|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Associate Members of the Regional Commissions. Each of these regions has a regional cooperation body: the [[Caribbean Community]], the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] and the [[Indian Ocean Commission]] respectively, which many SIDS are members or associate members of. In addition, most (but not all) SIDS are members of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), which performs lobbying and negotiating functions for the SIDS within the [[United Nations]] system. The [[UNCTAD]] website states that "the UN never established criteria to determine an official list of SIDS" but it maintains a shorter, unofficial list on its website for analytical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNCTAD´s unofficial list of SIDS|url=http://unctad.org/en/pages/aldc/Small%20Island%20Developing%20States/UNCTAD%C2%B4s-unofficial-list-of-SIDS.aspx|publisher=UNCTAD|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the macroscopic parameter for the hydraulic properties of the root system.

&lt;math&gt;SUF = \dfrac{J_r}{T_{act}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;J_r&lt;/math&gt; = the radial flow entering each root segment (&lt;math&gt;L^{3}T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;), and   
&lt;math&gt;T_{act}&lt;/math&gt; = the actual transpiration (&lt;math&gt;L^{3}T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;).

In order to get this parameter, the easiest way is to deal with Functionnal-Stuctural Plant Models. They will compute the radial water flow for each root segment and then devide the total by the actual transpiration.

==Standard Uptake Density==

The standard uptake density (SUD) (&lt;math&gt;L^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;) is the distribution of the water uptake flow rate in the soil where the water potential is uniform.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/1b34a7f53e951a37940477d1492389c2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=105724|title=A simple three-dimensional macroscopic root water uptake model based on the hydraulic architecture approach|journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences|volume=16|issue=8|pages=2957–2971|doi=10.5194/hess-16-2957-2012|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|year=2012|last1=Couvreur|first1=V.|last2=Vanderborght|first2=J.|last3=Javaux|first3=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words:

&lt;math&gt;SUD = \dfrac{SUF}{L_{segment}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_{segment}&lt;/math&gt; = the segment length (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;).

==Standard Sink Fraction==

The standard sink fraction (SSF) is very similar to the SUF, but instead of being a function of the root segment, it is related to the soil [[voxel]]. It is the normilised distribution of the sink term in a uniform water potential soil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Sugar Loaf''' is a 75-foot-high (23m) landlocked rock or stack in the interior of [[Mackinac Island]] in Lake Huron.  Created by erosion during the period of postglacial [[Lake Algonquin]], Sugar Loaf is the largest post-glacial erosion feature in the [[Straits of Mackinac]].    

The immense rock, which consists of resistant limestone [[breccia]], was cut off from Ancient Mackinac Island or the ''Turtle's Back'' by the glacial meltwaters of Lake Algonquin.  Polar storms released by the retreating ice sheet created erosional forces much stronger than any existing today on the [[Great Lakes]].   

The rock lies within the boundaries of the [[Mackinac Island State Park]] near the junction of Crooked Tree Road and Sugar Loaf Road.  It can be seen from ''Point Lookout'', near the Island's highest point. 

==Its name==
The primary sweetening enjoyed by people of all backgrounds on the frontier Great Lakes was [[maple sugar]], packed into [[Wiigwaasi-makak|cone-shaped baskets]] or ''makakoon'' of [[birchbark]].  Sugar Loaf Rock was named for its resemblance to one of these cones.

==Its lore==    
A wide variety of stories were told by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and frontier dwellers about Sugar Loaf.  It was said by some to be the home of [[Gitchie Manitou]].  Other tales suggested that the rock was the final form taken by a man afflicted with [[hubris]] who broke a [[taboo]] and was punished by being petrified into the form of a giant stone.  The profile in limestone, affixed to the side of Sugar Loaf Rock, of a male face may have suggested this legend.  The profile is said to be that of the lost soul, who can never escape the identity he took upon his moral condemnation.   

Sugar Loaf Rock appears to have been used as a site of ritual burials and inhumations.  In 1831, [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and his friend [[Gustave de Beaumont]] visited Mackinac Island.  De Beaumont reported that the rock was filled with "crevices and faults where the Indians sometimes deposed the bones of the dead."  Any such deposits have long since disappeared.

A natural cave passes through Sugar Loaf from side to side, too small for passage by any but adventurous children.

'''''The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne''''' is a 22-episode [[science fiction]] television series in the [[steampunk]] genre that first aired in June 2000 on [[CBC Television]] in Canada.  The series first ran in the United States on cable on The Sci-Fi Channel (now Syfy).

The plot concept is predicated on a vast fictional [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] beginning with the revelation that [[Jules Verne]] did not merely ''write'' the stories behind his famous science fiction classic books ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'', ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' or ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (Verne novel)|Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' — but actually experienced these adventures personally.

A television technological historic footnote, this work was the first hour-long series filmed entirely in [[High-definition television|HDTV]] format.

==Characters==
*Phileas Fogg as played by [[Michael Praed]]
*Rebecca Fogg as played by [[Francesca Hunt]]
*Passepartout as played by [[Michel Courtemanche]]
*Jules Verne as played by [[Chris Demetral]]

==Premise==
Jules Verne is a struggling author who joins Phileas, Rebecca, and Passepartout after a chance encounter. Phileas leads the group. Dapper, daring, intelligent, brash, and arrogant, Praed  described him as essentially a more flawed version of James Bond. Rebecca Fogg is his second cousin; it is clear that Phileas and Rebecca are attracted to one another, but it remains platonic. Passepartout is Phileas' valet, and an accomplished inventor/mechanician. Although Phileas treats Passepartout very poorly (at least by today's standards), the servant is a valued member of the crew.

The group's only recurring enemy is the League of Darkness, an international terrorist organization aiming to use steampunk technology to rule the world. Its leader: Count Gregory ([[Rick Overton]]), a steampunk [[cyborg]] who originally died 500 years ago.

Most episodes took advantage of both the [[Wold Newton family]] and [[metafictional]] possibilities of the premise. [[Mark Twain]], the [[Holy Grail]], and [[Cardinal Richelieu]] (played by [[Michael Praed]]) all made appearances.

Some parts of the show are truthfully historical, such as the mention of [[Nicolas Poussin]] or Verne's friendship with [[Alexandre Dumas]]. However, the show cannot be historically placed. For example, at least one episode ("Southern Comfort") takes place during the American Civil War (1861–1865). During the Civil War, the historical Jules Verne was already married; the fictional character remains single throughout the first season.  Also, the historical Verne would have been in his mid-thirties at the time of that conflict, whereas [[Chris Demetral]], the actor who portrayed him on television, was in his mid-twenties.

==The Aurora==
The Aurora is at the heart of The Secret Adventure of Jules Verne. The world's first dirigible [[airship]], property of Mr. Phileas Fogg of [[London]], it combines unexampled luxury, total mobility and an extraordinary array of weapons and gadgets. It is to this series what the [[Starship Enterprise]] is to [[Star Trek]]: both as a home base and also as the route to the world of adventure. The Aurora became Phileas' property after he won it in a poker game that was rigged by the British government.

==Soundtrack==
The series' main theme and incidental music was composed by [[Nick Glennie-Smith]]. In April 2011, [[Perseverance Records]] released a 2-CD soundtrack of the series' music. The soundtrack included the main theme, closing theme, "bumpers" (played at commercial breaks), and suites from every episode of the series apart from "The Book of Knowledge", for which the composer and the recording studio were unable to locate the original tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with album editor Gergely Hubai at hans-zimmer.com|url=http://www.hans-zimmer.com/fr/newsite.php?rub=detail&amp;id=1018|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Alfred Coward''', MSc, [[Zoological Society of London|FZS]], [[Royal Entomological Society of London|FRES]], [[British Ornithologists' Union|MBOU]]  (8 January 1867 – 29 January 1933), was an [[England|English]] [[ornithology|ornithologist]] and an amateur [[astronomy|astronomer]]. He wrote extensively on [[natural history]], [[local history]] and [[Cheshire]].

==Life==
He was born at 8 Higher Downs, [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]], [[Cheshire]] (now [[Greater Manchester]]) on 8 January 1867, the fourth and last child of Thomas and Sarah Coward. His father was a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister and in business as a partner in the firm of Melland and Coward, textile bleachers.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/45766 |title= Coward, Thomas Alfred (1867–1933) |accessdate= 11 June 2011 |last=Cardwell |first=Donald |year=  |work= [[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/36241 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coward's siblings were Charles, Alice and Annie.

After an education at Brooklands School, [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]] and at [[Owens College]] (now [[Manchester University]]), Coward worked in the family business for 19 years, before it was taken over by the Bleachers' Association. His share of the proceeds from the sale of Melland and Coward was sufficient to allow him to retire from business and concentrate on his love of wildlife and the study of birds, which had developed as a child.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite news |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/205/888/158380354w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS252389439&amp;dyn=5!xrn_23_0_CS252389439&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=kccl |newspaper=[[The Times]] |title=Mr T. A. Coward |date=31 January 1933 |page=15 |issue=46356 |accessdate=11 June 2011 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began writing articles on natural history for newspapers including ''[[The Liverpool Daily Post]]'', ''The Chester Cournant'' and ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' for which he wrote the "[[Country Diary]]" column until his death. General interest magazines for which he wrote included ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]'' and ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' and in specialist journals such as ''[[The Zoologist]]'', ''[[Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London]]'' and ''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]''.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

His first book was ''The Birds of Cheshire'', published in 1900, when he was living in Hale. His three-volume ''The Birds of the British Isles and their eggs'' (1920–25) was illustrated by [[Archibald Thorburn]] and was "acknowledged as being the book that did more to popularise the study of birds than any other publication produced during the first part of the twentieth century".&lt;ref name="Usher"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Usher |first1=Tony |title=T.A.Coward |url=http://www.10x50.com/coward/coward.htm |publisher=[[Knutsford Ornithological Society]] |accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revised by [[Arnold Boyd]] for a new edition in 1950.

He co-wrote articles and books on ornithology with [[Charles Oldham (naturalist)|Charles Oldham]], a former schoolmate.&lt;ref name="Ibis84-3"&gt;{{cite journal|author=W. E. G.&lt;!-- possibly William E. Glegg --&gt;|title=Obituary: Charles Oldham |journal=[[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]] |volume=84 |issue=3 |date=July 1942 |pages=440–443 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1942.tb05717.x/pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1942.tb05717.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married his cousin Mary Milne in 1904. There is a [[Blue Plaque]] at his former home, Brentwood Villa, 6 Grange Road, Bowdon,&lt;ref name="OP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/8447|title=Blue plaque № 8447 in Bowdon|work=Open Plaques|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which he moved in 1911.

On his death, the {{convert|14|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[Cotterill Clough Nature Reserve]]  was bought, by public subscription, in his honour.&lt;ref name="NWN-1934-03"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodkinson|first=Mr J.

His field notes are archived in the Department of Zoology at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].

=== Jizz ===

Coward is credited with the first use in print of the term "''[[Jizz (birding)|Jizz]]''", in his "Country Diary" column of 6 December 1921 - the piece was subsequently included in his 1922 book "Bird Haunts and Nature Memories".&lt;ref name="BB111"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenwood |first1=Jeremy J.D. |authorlink1=Jeremy Greenwood |last2=Greenwood |first2= Julian G. |title=The Origin of the Birdwatching Term "Jizz" |journal=[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]] |date=May 2018 |volume=111 |issue=5 |page=292-294}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed it to "a west-coast Irishman".&lt;ref name="BB111" /&gt;

[[File:Urrbrae1.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Aerial view of wetland surrounded by suburbs |Urrbrae Wetland]]
The '''Urrbrae Wetland''' is a constructed urban [[wetland]] in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] located in the suburb of [[Urrbrae, South Australia|Urrbrae]] in the [[Adelaide|Adelaide metrolpolitan area]]. It was constructed to manage flood water from the nearby [[Adelaide Hills]] and has been developed to provide [[ecological]] and educational benefits. The wetland covers approximately 6 hectares&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mitchamcouncil.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=1492 |title=Urrbrae Wetland Facts |first= |last= |work=mitchamcouncil.sa.gov.au |year=|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of land previously part of [[Urrbrae Agricultural High School]]. The area of water is approximately 4 hectares and when full, contains approximately 13.5 million litres of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mitchamcouncil.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=1493 |title=The Function of the Wetland |first= |last=|work=mitchamcouncil.sa.gov.au |year=|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Urrbrae1a.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Aerial view of wetland surrounded by suburbs |Wetland and Adelaide Hills]]
The wetland consists of four ponds: the main pond, two [[sedimentation pond]]s and the farm dam.  The main pond is clay lined and is designed to be kept filled to prevent drying out and cracking.  The farm dam is synthetic lined and is used to top up the main dam when water levels are low.  In an average year about 400 million litres of storm water passes through the wetland each year.   When the wetland is full it contains about 13.5 million litres of water from a catchment of approximately 380 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mitchamcouncil.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=1492 |title=Urrbrae Wetland Facts |first= |last= |work=mitchamcouncil.sa.gov.au |year=|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although it is not a true wetland, it serves a useful function in the cleansing of the stormwater via natural cleaning process including:

* The water flow is slowed down
* Sand and other sediments fall to the bottom
* Heavy metals, salts, bacteria et ‘stick’ onto the falling sand particles
* Reeds, sedges and other plants along the shores filter out much of the salts and heavy metals.

Leaf litter, plastic bags and other debris is removed by trash removal systems at the entry to the sedimentation ponds to aid in cleansing of the water. 
The cleansed water then travels via storm water pipes to [[Brown Hill Creek]] and to the sea. This process is arranged and funded by the City of Mitcham.  In 2011 construction began on pipes and facilities for some of the water to be pumped to tanks at the High School and used for watering grounds during summer months.

== History ==
In July 1993 the [[City of Mitcham]] and the [[Urrbrae Agricultural High School]] were independently investigating a wetland project.  Mitcham Council was seeking to alleviate a long-standing flooding problem, while the school wanted to address regular flooding on its farmland and to broaden its environmental studies curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mitchamcouncil.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=1270 |title=Urrbrae Wetland |first= |last=|work=mitchamcouncil.sa.gov.au |year=|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Work on the project to construct the Urrbrae detention basin that would store the excess water commenced in June 1996 and finished in December 1996. It cost $1.2m, contributed by the City of Mitcham, the SA Department of Transport and the [Patawalonga River | Patawalonga] Catchment Water Management Board.  The Education Department provided the land that was originally bequeathed to the State of South Australia for educational use by [[Peter Waite (philanthropist)|Peter Waite]], a prominent pastoralist of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/waite-peter-993 |title=Biography - Peter Waite - Australian Dictionary of Biography |first= Marjorie|last=Findlay |work=adb.anu.edu.au |year=2011 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 1997 the organisation, The Friends of the Urrbrae Wetland, was established, sponsored initially by the [[Rotary International|Rotary]] Club, Mitcham.  The chief activity of the Friends is to establish, as far as possible, the native vegetation which existed prior to European settlement, and which is generally known as grey box woodland, [[Eucalyptus microcarpa]]. The Friends meet weekly for environmental improvement tasks including planting and weeding.

== Ecosystem ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:greyboxwoodland.jpg|thumb |alt=Grey box woodland surrounding lake with walkway |Grey box woodland and pond]] --&gt;

===Plants===
[[File:Red wattlebird feeding off Grey Box flowers.jpg|thumb|Red wattlebird feeding off grey box flowers]]
The native vegetation which existed prior to European settlement, and now found in the wetland, is generally known as grey box woodland. This ecological community is now classified as 'threatened' by the Australian Government Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicshowcommunity.pl?id=86 |title=Grey Box (Eucalyptus microcarpa) Grassy Woodlands and Derived Native Grasslands of South-eastern Australia |first= |last=|work=environment.gov.au |year=|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grey box woodland====

The grey box woodland consists mainly of ''[[Eucalyptus microcarpa]]'', commonly known as the "grey box"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.anbg.gov.au/cgi-bin/apni?taxon_id=1603 |title=Australian Plant Name Index |first= |last=|work=anbg.gov.au |year=|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its bark colour, which was a dominant species on the southern Adelaide Plains.  Over the years the Friends have planted over one hundred indigenous terrestrial and aquatic plant species to maximise diversity, habitat and serve as a resource for other revegetation projects.

For example,
* Canopy plants: Grey box (''Eucalyptus microcarpa''), river red gum (''[[Eucalyptus camaldulensis]]''), South Australian blue gum (''[[Eucalyptus leucoxylon]]'')) and drooping sheoak (''[[Allocasuarina verticillata]]''), ''Callitris gracilis'' and native apricot
* Shrubs including five different varieties of acacias or wattles, ''Bursaria spinosa'', sticky hop bush, ''Dodonaea viscosa''

====Birds====
[[File:Pacific Black Duck jun08.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Grey duck swimming in smooth water|Pacific black duck]]
The permanent water in the wetland, its adjacent habitats and a reliable feed source, have attracted many species of waterbirds to this site. Commonly seen birds are [[Pacific black duck]] hybrids, [[Australian wood duck]], [[Australasian grebe]], [[Eurasian coot]]. Some rarely seen birds are [[sacred kingfisher]], and the [[little lorikeet]].

With the presence of maturing nectar bearing and insect attracting flora, an increasing number of bush birds can also be seen in the different seasons. For example, when the eucalpytus are flowering the [[New Holland honeyeater]], [[musk lorikeet]] and [[rainbow lorikeet]] are frequent visitors. Breeding of some species is occurring in the Wetland, including the, [[dusky moorhen]], [[Eurasian coot]], [[Australasian grebe]], [[clamorous reed warbler]], [[magpie-lark]], [[willie wagtail]], [[crested pigeon]] and [[spotted turtle dove]].

== Education ==

===School and tertiary education===

The wetland has a classroom with laboratory facilities and visual aids providing a major learning centre for the Urrbrae Agricultural High School and TAFE (Technical and Further Education) students on the nearby school campus.  The school funds the position of a Science Teacher-Manager permanently on site.  It is also used by other schools and community groups who come to the centre to learn about the role of wetland.  Each year about 10,000 students visit the wetland.

===Community education===

The Friends of the Urrbrae Wetland offer two Open Days a year which include a talk and guided walk, to which the general public is invited.  A focus of these talks and guided walks is the reestablishment of the Grey Box Woodland.

{{this|water use in plant metabolism|water use efficiency by humans|Water efficiency}}

'''Water-use efficiency (WUE)''' refers to the [[ratio]] of [[water]] used in [[plant metabolism]] to water lost by the [[plant (botanical)|plant]] through [[transpiration]]. Two types of water-use efficiency are referred to most frequently:

*[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] water-use efficiency (also called intrinsic or instantaneous water-use efficiency), which is defined as the ratio of the rate of [[carbon assimilation]] (photosynthesis) to the rate of transpiration, and
* water-use efficiency of productivity (also called integrated water-use efficiency), which is typically defined as the ratio of [[biomass]] produced to the rate of transpiration.

Increases in water-use efficiency are commonly cited as a response mechanism of plants to moderate to severe [[soil]] water deficits, and has been the focus of many programs that seek to increase [[crop]] tolerance of [[drought]]. However, there is some question as to the benefit of increased water-use efficiency of plants in [[agricultural systems]], as the processes of increased yield production and decreased transpirational water loss (that is, the main driver of increases in water-use efficiency) are fundamentally opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, M. ''Water Use Efficiency in Plant Biology.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2004. {{ISBN|1-4051-1434-7}}. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; If there existed a situation where water deficit induced lower transpirational rates without simultaneously decreasing photosynthetic rates and biomass production, then water-use efficiency would be both greatly improved and a desired trait in [[crop productivity|crop production]].

Codes and ciphers were used extensively in [[World War I]]. The decoding by British Naval intelligence of the [[Zimmermann telegram]] helped bring the United States into the war.

[[Trench code]]s were used by field armies of most of the combatants (Americans, British, French, German) in World War I.

The most commonly used codes were simple substitution codes. More important messages generally used mathematical encryption for extra security, though. The use of these codes required the distribution of codebooks to military personnel, which proved to be a security liability since these books could be stolen by enemy forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lerner|first1=Adrienne|title=World War I|url=http://www.faqs.org/espionage/Vo-Z/World-War-I.html|website=Espionage Information: Encyclopedia of Espionage, Intelligence, and Security|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==

==Russia==
* [[Ernst Fetterlein]] was in the Tzarist Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1896, and solved (among others) German, Austrian and British codes. He was eventually made chief cryptographer with the rank of admiral. With the Russian Revolution in 1917 he fled to Britain, and was recruited to Room 40 in June 1918 to work on Austrian, Bolshevik, and Georgian codes.
* The Russians used an overcomplicated version of the [[Vigenère Cipher]]. It was broken within three days by Austro-Hungarian cryptanalyst [[Hermann Pokorny]].

==France==
The French Army employed [[Georges Painvin]], and [[Étienne Bazeries]] who came out of retirement, on German ciphers. Due to their prewar activities, the French were more prepared than any other nation involved in the war to decode German radiograms. At the beginning of the war, France had eight intercept stations: Maubeuge, Verdun, Toul, Epinal, Belfort, Lille, Rheims, and Besançon. During the war, they set up many more stations, including one in the Eiffel Tower. According to Colonel Cartier of the War Ministry, France intercepted over 100,000,000 words from German radiograms during the course of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahn|first1=David|title=The Codebreakers|date=1967|publisher=Scribner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Tableau de Concordance]] was the main French diplomatic cipher.

==Germany and Austria==
Germany and Austria intercepted Russian radio traffic, although German success at the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)]] was due to interception of messages between the Russian commanders in clear.

The German [[Abhorchdienst]], a code-breaking bureau composed mainly of mathematicians, was established in 1916.

The Germans had specific regulations regarding which kinds of codes and ciphers could be used under given circumstances. Within three kilometers of the front lines, known as the danger zone, all communications were required to be in a code known as the three-number code. This was the only code or cipher permitted. Behind this danger zone, another code known as the three-letter code was allowed to be used. Communications between divisions, corps, and army headquarters were done with the ADFGVX cipher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=William|title=Solving German Codes in World War I|date=1977|publisher=Aegean Park Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADFGX and [[ADFGVX]] field ciphers were a modified [[Polybius square | polybius system]] with single order double columnar transposition and frequent key change, with letters optimized for Morse. It was later broken by the famous French cryptanalyst [[Georges Painvin]]. The breaking of the ADFGX cipher by Painvin was the second time during the war that cryptanalysis played a major role in shaping events (the first being the interception and cracking of the Zimmerman Telegram). By breaking the cipher, the French were able to decode an intercepted message about the forwarding of munitions for a German offensive, letting the French know where and when the offensive would occur, and thus allowing them to stop it. This message became known as "The Radiogram of Victory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahn|first1=David|title=In Memoriam: Georges-Jean Painvain|journal=Cryptologica|volume=6|issue=2|pages=120–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
[[Herbert Yardley]] began as a code clerk in the State Department. After the outbreak of war he became the head of the cryptographic section of Military Intelligence Section [[Black Chamber|(MI-8)]]&lt;ref name=Codebreakers&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahn|first=David|title=The Codebreakers: the Story of Secret Writing|year=1996|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=0-684-83130-9|page=352|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEH_rHkgaogC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;lpg=PA352#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was with the American Expeditionary Force in World War I as a Signals Corps cryptologic officer in France. He later headed the Cipher Bureau, a new cryptanalysis group started in 1919, immediately after World War I, and funded jointly by the State Department and the US Army.

Some American cryptography in World War I was done at the ''Riverbank Laboratory'' where [[Elizebeth Friedman]], [[William F. Friedman]] and [[Agnes Meyer Driscoll]] worked. The ''Riverbank Laboratory'', Chicago was privately owned by Colonel George Fabyan.

The US Navy used the cryptographic code [[A-1 (code)|A-1]]. The US Navy cryptanalysis group, [[OP-20-G]], was also started after World War I (in 1922).

The US also started employing Indian [[code talker]]s in World War I, initially with members of the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes.
