[[File:Amalickiah by Josh Cotton.jpg|thumb|An artist's interpretation of Amalackiah, Nephite dissenter and usurper of the Lamanite throne. Digital sculpture by Josh Cotton.|upright=1.5]]

In the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Amalickiah''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˌ|m|æ|l|ɪ|ˈ|k|aɪ|.|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «a-măl´a-kī´a»&lt;/ref&gt; '''Ameleckiah''' as a frequent scribal variant in the Original Manuscript&lt;ref&gt;R. Skousen, ''Analysis of Textual Variants of the Book of Mormon'' (Provo: FARMS, 2004-2009), 4:2529.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Nephite]] leader of a movement to reestablish a king, specifically himself, as the king of the [[Nephites]].  When he failed to gain power through a popular uprising he dissented to the [[Lamanites]] becoming their king and using them as a means to gain power over the [[Nephites]].  He was killed during the ensuing war.

==Biography==

===Amalickiahite movement===
The Amalickiahite ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|æ|l|.|ə|ˈ|k|aɪ|.|ə|.|aɪ|t}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «a-măl´a-kī´a-īt»&lt;/ref&gt;) movement arose during a power vacuum following the separation of church and state and by the transfer of leadership of the church from [[Alma the Younger]] to his son [[Helaman]].  [[Helaman]] succeeded his father as High Priest over the Nephite Church but did not have any political authority.  His father was the last High Priest who also held the post of Chief Judge (or governor) of the [[Nephites]].  [[Alma the Younger]] had found that the church suffered from neglect due to his political duties and so resigned the latter office.

Amalickiah is described as a large and strong man who was also an eloquent speaker.  He may have been a lower (i.e. local) judge, for many of his followers (called Amalickiahites) held that office.  It is noted that he was also a member of the Nephite Church, and that the lower judges were members themselves.  They were upset with the reforms or "regulation" of the church established by [[Helaman]] following the last war with the [[Lamanites]].  They were angry over the preaching by [[Helaman]] and his high priests &amp;mdash; So angry that they were willing to kill [[Helaman]] and all those that held an opposing view.

===Moroni's counter-revolution===
[[Captain Moroni]] learned of the Amalickiahites' rebellion, and rallied the Nephite people against it.  He raised the [[Title of Liberty]] over the capital, and then over every city of the land where the rebellion was taking place.  Those that followed the [[Title of Liberty]] and the reformed church called themselves Christians.  The rebels were soon outnumbered in the land, their hopes for power broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=46|verse=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent to the Lamanites===
Amalickiah led his followers away into the wilderness to join the [[Lamanites]] when he realized his political campaign had failed.  Moroni did not want their enemy to gain any further strength so he set off in pursuit with the army.  Moroni's army defeated the rebels, but Amalickiah and a small band of trusted followers escaped to the [[land of Nephi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=46|verse=3|range=-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===King of the Lamanites===
Amalickiah and his men went to the court of the Lamanite king and persuaded him to issue a call to arms against the Nephites.  However, this proved unpopular with the majority of warriors, the [[Lamanites]] having just lost a costly war against the [[Nephites]].  Amalickiah flattered the king and got appointed to command the loyalists.  He is ordered to go and compel the rest of the warriors into the army to fight for the king.

The rebels outnumbered the loyalist army that Amalickiah commands.  Knowing he would likely fail to press the warriors into the army, he came up with plan to use his greatest strengths: flattery and treachery.  Setting up camp at the base of a large hill where the rebels were in their defensive position, he secretly sent word to the rebel leader [[Lehonti]] that he will betray the loyalists into the rebels' hands if he is made second in command of the rebel army.  [[Lehonti]] agrees, and Amalickiah sets his own men as guards, allowing the rebel army to approach and surround the loyalist camp.  When the loyal warriors woke to see themselves in a hopeless position, they begged Amalickiah to allow them to surrender and join the rebels to save their lives.  Amalickiah gains standing with the rebels, "saves" his men, and becomes second-in-command of the combined Lamanite army.

This was not enough for Amalickiah, for he wanted to be king.  He slowly poisoned [[Lehonti]] while the army is marching to the capital.  When [[Lehonti]] died on the march, command then fell to Amalickiah.  At the capital the Lamanite king got word that his army is approaching with general Amalickiah at the head.  The king was pleased and, accompanied by his closest servants, went to meet him.  As the king neared, the henchmen of Amalickiah went before him bowing to the king.  The king raised his arm beckoning them to rise.  As the first henchman does he drew a dagger and thrust it up into the chest of the king.  He fell, slain by the assassins.

The servants of the king then turned to run away.  Amalickiah's henchmen shouted to the army that the king has been slain by his own servants.  Amalickiah led the warriors to the fallen king and feigns heartache at such treachery.  He goaded the warriors, former loyalist and rebel alike, to go and slay the king's servants.  Despite pursuit, the servants escape to the Nephites and tell the tale of Amalickiah's deceit.

Meanwhile, as commander of the army, Amalickiah goes to the court to tell the queen the awful news.  After telling of the treacherous attack by the king's servants, he brings forth his assassins who swear that the servants fled because of their perfidity.  Amalickiah comforts and woos the grieving queen.  Soon he marries her to become the next king of the [[Lamanites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:amalickiah.jpg|right|thumb|This illustration was published in the 1910 edition of the book entitled Cities in the Sun.]]

===War against the Nephites===
As the new king Amalickiah proceeded to aggravate the Lamanites to war against the [[Nephites]].  Staying behind with his new queen, he sent his armies to attack the Nephites under the command of Nephite dissenters.  Their plan was to attack those cities that had previously shown to be weakest.  Unfortunately for them, [[Captain Moroni]] had fortified all the Nephite cities, in case of such a sneak attack.  The Lamanites proceeded to assault the walls of these "weak" cities, never once managing to slay a single Nephite in the process, while losing many men and all their chief captains who led the forlorn hope.  They returned to relate the tale of bad news to their king.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Amalickiah, however, was not to be deterred.  As the Nephites were dealing with [[king-men]], Amalickiah saw his advantage, and began to capture Nephite cities on the eastern coast, well away from [[Captain Moroni]] and his main army.  After taking seven cities, however, he was met by [[Teancum]] whose force stood up to the king.  Teancum's warriors wore the Lamanite army down till they withdrew into camp for the night.  Teancum sneaked into the king's camp with a trusted aide and killed Amalickiah with a javelin.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working in small comedy clubs in the early 1970s, Kaufman came to the attention of a wider audience in 1975, when he was invited to perform portions of his act on the first season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. His Foreign Man character was the basis of his performance as [[Latka Gravas]] on the hit television show [[Taxi (TV series)|''Taxi'']] from 1978 until 1983.&lt;ref name="nytimesobituary"&gt;{{cite news|date=May 18, 1984|last=Prial|first=Frank J.|title=ANDY KAUFMAN, A COMEDIAN KNOWN FOR UNORTHODOX SKITS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/18/obituaries/andy-kaufman-a-comedian-known-for-unorthodox-skits.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he continued to tour comedy clubs and theaters in a series of unique performance art / comedy shows, sometimes appearing as himself and sometimes as obnoxiously rude [[lounge singer]] [[Tony Clifton]]. He was also a frequent guest on [[sketch comedy]] and [[late-night talk show]]s, particularly ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref name="beloved"/&gt; In 1982, Kaufman brought his [[professional wrestling]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] act to Letterman's show by way of a staged encounter with [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] of the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (although the fact that the altercation was planned in advance was not publicly disclosed for over a decade).

Kaufman died of lung cancer in 1984, at the age of 35.&lt;ref name="clifton"/&gt; Because pranks and elaborate ruses were major elements of his career, persistent rumors have circulated that Kaufman [[Faked death|faked his own death]] as a grand hoax.&lt;ref name="beloved"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=March 30, 1995|title=Tip-off|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19950330&amp;id=P-RNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=If0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5605,6852532|publisher=''Lakeland Ledger''|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to be respected for the variety of his characters, his uniquely counterintuitive approach to comedy, and his willingness to provoke negative and confused reactions from audiences.&lt;ref name="beloved"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 9, 1984|last=Handler|first=David|title=Kaufman Blazed New Trails|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19840609&amp;id=qSgxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GwYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2505,4904519|publisher=''Ocala Star-Banner''|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kaufman was born on January 17, 1949, in New York City, the oldest of three children. His mother was Janice (née Bernstein), a homemaker and former fashion model, and his father was Stanley Kaufman, a jewelry salesman.&lt;ref name="funhousep6-10"&gt;Zehme. pp.6–10&lt;/ref&gt; Andy, along with his younger brother Michael and sister Carol, grew up in a middle-class [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck]], [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name="funhousep12"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zehme |first=Bill |date=1999 |title=Lost in the Funhouse: The Life and Mind of Andy Kaufman |publisher=Delacorte Press |page=12 |isbn=9780385333719 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began performing at children's birthday parties at age 9, playing records and showing cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andykaufman.jvlnet.com/realmotm.htm|title="The Real Man on the Moon Talks" by Kaufman's father|publisher=Andykaufman.jvlnet.com|accessdate=February 10, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111075409/http://andykaufman.jvlnet.com/realmotm.htm|archivedate= January 11, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman spent much of his youth writing poetry and stories, including an unpublished novel, ''The Hollering Mangoo'', which he completed at age 16.&lt;ref name="funhousepp67-68"&gt;Zehme. pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt; Following a visit to his school from Nigerian musician [[Babatunde Olatunji]], Kaufman began playing the [[congas]].&lt;ref name="funhousep38-39"&gt;Zehme. pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After graduating from [[John L. Miller Great Neck North High School|Great Neck North High School]] in 1967, Kaufman took a year off before enrolling at the now defunct two-year [[Grahm Junior College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grahmjuniorcollege.org/alumni.htm |title=Grahm Junior College Alumni|website=Grahmjuniorcollege.org |date=2017-01-03 |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Boston,&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|date=December 30, 1979|title=Profile: Andy Kaufman|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1697&amp;dat=19791230&amp;id=fjAqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A0cEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6674,6067310|publisher=''Park City Daily News''|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied television production and starred in his own campus television show, ''Uncle Andy's Fun House.''&lt;ref name="nytimesobituary"/&gt; In August 1969, he hitchhiked to Las Vegas to meet Elvis Presley, showing up unannounced at the International Hotel. Soon after, he began performing at coffee houses and developing his act, as well as writing a one-man play, ''Gosh'' (later renamed ''God'' and published in 2000).&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; After graduating in 1971, he began performing stand-up comedy at various small clubs on the [[East coast of the United States|East Coast]].&lt;ref name="funhousep132-141"&gt;Zehme. pp.132–141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cabaret"&gt;{{cite news|date=July 11, 1974|last=Shepard|first=Richard F.|title=Songs and a New Comedian Make Lively Cabaret|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/11/archives/songs-and-a-new-comedian-make-lively-cabaret.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Foreign Man and Mighty Mouse===
Kaufman first received major attention for his character Foreign Man, who spoke in a meek, high-pitched, heavy-accented voice and claimed to be from "Caspiar", a fictional island in the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref name="cabaret"/&gt; It was as this character that Kaufman convinced the owner of the famed New York City comedy club [[The Improv]], [[Budd Friedman]], to allow him to perform on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Improv Comedy Club History|url=http://improv.com/History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zoglin"&gt;{{cite book|date=2008|last=Zoglin|first=Richard|title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America|url=http://www.abebooks.com/9781582346243/Comedy-Edge-Stand-up-1970s-Changed-1582346240/plp|isbn=1582346240|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Foreign Man, Kaufman would appear on the stage of [[comedy club]]s, play a recording of the theme from the ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'' cartoon show while standing perfectly still, and [[lip sync|lip-sync]] only the line "Here I come to save the day" with great enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="cnn2012"/&gt; He would proceed to tell a few (purposely poor) jokes and conclude his act with a series of celebrity [[impersonator|impersonations]], with the comedy arising from the character's obvious ineptitude at impersonation. For example, in his fake accent Kaufman would say to the audience, "I would like to imitate [[Jimmy Carter|Meester Carter]], de president of de United States" and then, in exactly the same voice, say "Hello, I am Meester Carter, de president of de United States. T'ank you veddy much."
At some point in the performance, usually when the audience was conditioned to Foreign Man's inability to perform a single convincing impression, Foreign Man would announce, "And now I would like to imitate the [[Elvis Presley]]", turn around, take off his jacket, slick his hair back, and launch into a rousing, hip-shaking, excellent rendition of Presley singing one of his hit songs. Like Presley, he would take off his leather jacket during the song and throw it into the audience, but unlike Presley, Foreign Man would immediately ask for it to be returned. After the song's finale, he would take a simple bow and say in his Foreign Man voice, "T'ank you veddy much."{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Portions of Kaufman's Foreign Man act were broadcast in the first season of ''Saturday Night Live''. The Mighty Mouse number was featured in the October 11, 1975, premiere, while the joke-telling and celebrity impressions (including Elvis) were included in the November 8 broadcast that same year.&lt;ref name="snl-s1"&gt;''SNL: The Complete First Season, 1975–1976''. DVD recording.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Kaufman's performances on ''Taxi'' were widely praised, even receiving two Golden Globe nominations, he was unhappy about being so closely identified with Latka.]]

Kaufman first used his Foreign Man character in nightclubs in the early 1970s, often to tell jokes incorrectly and do weak imitations of famous people before bursting into his Elvis Presley imitation. The character was then changed into Latka Gravas for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s sitcom ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', appearing in 79 of 114 episodes in 1978-83.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[Bob Zmuda]] confirms this: "They basically were buying Andy's Foreign Man character for the ''Taxi'' character Latka."&lt;ref name="oral"&gt;[http://www.bluedonut.com/ak.htm "Andy Kaufman Oral History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206215413/http://www.bluedonut.com/ak.htm |date=December 6, 2006 }}, interviews with Don Steinberg, originally published in short form in ''GQ Magazine'', December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman's longtime manager [[George Shapiro]] encouraged him to take the gig.

Kaufman disliked sitcoms and was not happy with the idea of being in one, but Shapiro convinced him that it would quickly lead to stardom, which would earn him money he could then put into his own act. Kaufman agreed to appear in 14 episodes per season, and initially wanted four for Kaufman's alter ego [[Tony Clifton]]. After Kaufman deliberately sabotaged Clifton's appearance on the show, however, that part of his contract was dropped.&lt;ref name="clifton"&gt;{{cite web|date=May 23, 1984|last=Shales|first=Tom|title=Kaufman's many faces made him one of a kind|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19840523&amp;id=gWoaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QioEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7154,1748529&amp;hl=en|publisher=''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]''|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His character was given [[multiple personality disorder]], which allowed Kaufman to randomly portray other characters. In one episode of ''Taxi'', Kaufman's character came down with a condition that made him act like Alex Reiger, the main character played by [[Judd Hirsch]]. Another such recurring character played by Kaufman was the womanizing Vic Ferrari.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0718495 ''Taxi'' (Season 3, Episode 20, "Latka the Playboy"], imdb.com; accessed January 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sam Simon]], who early in his career was a writer and later [[showrunner]] for ''Taxi'', stated in a 2013 interview on Marc Maron's [[WTF with Marc Maron|''WTF'' podcast]] that the story of Kaufman having been generally disruptive on the show was "a complete fiction" largely created by Zmuda. Simon maintained that Zmuda has a vested interest in promoting an out-of-control image of Kaufman. In the interview Simon stated that Kaufman was "completely professional" and that he "told you Tony Clifton was him", but he also conceded that Kaufman would have "loved" Zmuda's version of events.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maron, Marc]] (May 16, 2013).

Kaufman was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor&amp;nbsp;– Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Limited Series, or Motion Picture Made For Television]] for ''Taxi'' in 1979 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden Globe Awards: Winners &amp; Nominees|url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/andy-kaufman|publisher=GoldenGlobes.com|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tony Clifton===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
{{Main|Tony Clifton}}
Another well-known Kaufman character is Tony Clifton, an absurd, audience-abusing [[lounge singer]] who began opening for Kaufman at comedy clubs and eventually even performed concerts on his own around the country. Sometimes it was Kaufman performing as Clifton, sometimes it was his brother Michael or Zmuda. For a brief time, it was unclear to some that Clifton was not a real person. News programs interviewed Clifton as Kaufman's opening act, with the mood turning ugly whenever Kaufman's name came up. Kaufman, Clifton insisted, was attempting to ruin Clifton's "good name" in order to make money and become famous.

As a requirement for Kaufman's accepting the offer to star on ''Taxi'', he insisted that Clifton be hired for a guest role on the show as if he were a real person, not a character.&lt;ref name="clifton"/&gt; After throwing a tantrum on the set, Clifton was fired and escorted from the studio lot by security guards. Much to Kaufman's delight, this incident was reported in the local newspapers.&lt;ref name="standup"&gt;{{cite book|date=2009|last=Knoedelseder|first=William|title=I'm Dying Up Here: Heartbreak and High Times in Stand-up Comedy's Golden Era|isbn=9781586483173|publisher=''PublicAffairs''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carnegie Hall show===
At the beginning of an April 1979 performance at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]], Kaufman invited his "grandmother" to watch the show from a chair he had placed at the side of the stage. At the end of the show, she stood up, took her mask off and revealed to the audience that she was actually comedian [[Robin Williams]] in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=April 28, 1979|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=Comedy: Andy Kaufman Fills Stage With Parade of Odd Characters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/28/archives/comedy-andy-kaufman-fills-stage-with-parade-of-odd-characters.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufman also had an elderly woman (Eleanor Cody Gould) pretend to have a heart attack and die on stage, at which point he reappeared on stage wearing a Native American [[headdress]] and performed a dance over her body, "reviving" her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shackett|first=Barbara|date=2013|title=Stranded in Montana; Dumped in Arizona|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jnL3GnL3HfQC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=eleanor+cody+gould+andy+kaufman#v=onepage&amp;q=eleanor%20cody%20gould%20andy%20kaufman&amp;f=false|publisher=''Dorrance Publishing''|isbn=9781434928559|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1979"&gt;{{cite web|date=July 1, 1979|last=Carter|first=Betsy|title=Hide-'n'-seek in Andy Kaufman's fun house|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/hide-n-seek-in-andy-kaufmans-fun-house/2014/10/06/e2e03928-4d93-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_story.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance is most famous for Kaufman's ending the show by actually taking the entire audience, in 24 buses, out for milk and cookies. He invited anyone interested to meet him on the [[Staten Island Ferry]] the next morning, where the show continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 28, 1979|title=Comic Encore: Milk, Cookies For Audience|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19790427&amp;id=Vr4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IO4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7011,1562422&amp;hl=en|publisher=''The Ottawa Citizen''|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV specials===
The ''Taxi'' deal with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] included giving Kaufman a television special/pilot. He came up with ''Andy's Funhouse'', based on an old routine he had developed while in junior college. The special was taped in 1977 but did not air until August 1979. It featured most of Andy's famous gags, including Foreign Man/Latka and his Elvis Presley impersonation, as well as a host of unique segments (including a special appearance by children's television character [[Howdy Doody]] and the "Has-been Corner").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=August 28, 1979|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=TV: A 90‐Minute Special With Andy Kaufman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/28/archives/tv-a-90minute-special-with-andy-kaufman.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a segment that included fake television screen static as part of the gag, which ABC executives were not comfortable with, fearing that viewers would mistake the static for broadcast problems and would change the channel—which was the comic element Kaufman wanted to present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=August 3, 1989|last=Wickstrom|first=Andy|title=Andy Kaufman Still Surprises in a 1977 Video|url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-08-03/entertainment/26147012_1_latka-gravas-andy-kaufman-foreigner|website=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Andy's Funhouse'' was written by Kaufman, Zmuda, and Mel Sherer, with music by Kaufman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 22, 2013|last=Elisberg|first=Robert J.|title=Pal Mel|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-j-elisberg/pal-mel_b_3319754.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1980, Kaufman filmed a short segment for an ABC show called ''Buckshot.'' The segment was just over six minutes long and was called ''Uncle Andy's Funhouse''. It featured Kaufman as the host of a children's show for adults, complete with a [[peanut gallery]] and Tony Clifton puppet.&lt;ref name="uncleandy"&gt;{{cite web|date=July 18, 1980|last=Arnott|first=Susan L.|title=The Television Picture: What's Special...|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19800718&amp;id=JiEqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rysEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6782,4112414&amp;hl=en|publisher=''The Milwaukee Journal''|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, a show very similar to ''Andy's Funhouse'' and ''Uncle Andy's Funhouse'' was filmed for [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s [[Soundstage (TV series)|SoundStage]] program, called ''The Andy Kaufman Show''. It too featured a peanut gallery, and [[cold open|opened in the middle]] of an interview Kaufman is doing in which he is laughing hysterically. He then proceeds to thank the audience for watching and the credits roll.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===''Fridays'' incidents===
In 1981 Kaufman made three appearances on ''[[Fridays (ABC TV series)|Fridays]]'', a variety show on ABC that was similar to ''Saturday Night Live''. In his first appearance, during a sketch about four people out on a dinner date who excuse themselves to the restroom to smoke [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], Kaufman broke character and refused to say his lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=February 24, 1981|last=Schwartz|first=Tony|title=Was 'Fight' on TV Real or Staged?

In response, cast member [[Michael Richards]] walked off camera and returned with a set of cue cards and dumped them on the table in front of Kaufman who responded by splashing Richards with water. Co-producer [[Jack Burns]] stormed onto the stage, leading to a brawl on camera before the show abruptly cut away to a commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/544255131b|title=Andy Kaufman on Fridays from FridaysFan|publisher=Funnyordie.com|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richards has claimed that this incident was a staged practical joke that was known only to him, associate producer Burns, and Kaufman,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2 "Michael Richards 'Speaking Freely' transcript"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808113050/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2 |date=August 8, 2014 }}; recorded February 28, 2002 in Aspen, Colorado. Firstamendmentcenter.org (February 28, 2002); retrieved October 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Melanie Chartoff]], who played Kaufman's wife in the sketch, has stated that, just before airtime, Burns told her, [[Maryedith Burrell]], and Richards that Kaufman was going to break the [[fourth wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 28, 2007|last=Chartoff|first=Melanie|title=An Andy Kaufman Story&amp;nbsp;– What really happened on that infamous episode of "Fridays"?

Kaufman appeared the following week in a videotaped apology to the home viewers. Later that year, Kaufman returned to host ''Fridays''. At one point in the show, he invited a ''[[Lawrence Welk Show]]'' gospel and standards singer, [[Kathie Sullivan]], on stage to sing a few gospel songs with him and announced that the two were engaged to be married, then talked to the audience about his newfound faith in Jesus (Kaufman was Jewish). That was also a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60822022.html|title=Kaufman Was My Hoax Fiance; The Taxi star pulled some of the funniest stunts on US TV, but his fake engagement fooled the world|last=Burton|first=Alex|date=February 25, 2000|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|accessdate= January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, following a sketch about a drug-abusing pharmacist, Kaufman was supposed to introduce the band [[The Pretenders]]. Instead of introducing the band, he delivered a nervous speech about the harmfulness of drugs while the band stood behind him ready to play. After his speech, he informed the audience that he had talked for too long and had to go to a commercial.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Professional wrestling===
Inspired by the theatricality of ''[[kayfabe]]'', the staged nature of the sport, and his own tendency to form elaborate hoaxes, Kaufman began [[Intergender wrestling|wrestling women]] during his act and proclaimed himself "Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion of the World", taking on an aggressive and ridiculous personality based on the characters invented by professional wrestlers. He offered a $1,000 prize to any woman who could pin him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 21, 1979|last=Rosenberg|first=Howard|title=Corpus Christi Cosmetician Among Competitors: Woman-Wrestling Comic May Meet Match|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19791221&amp;id=bsJRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SmkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6937,5869625&amp;hl=en|publisher=''The Victoria Advocate''|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 26, 1979|title=Ms. Peckham eyes rematch with Kaufman|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19791226&amp;id=HRBbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cU4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3846,4000677&amp;hl=en|publisher=''Bangor Daily News''|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He employed performance artist [[Laurie Anderson]], a friend of his, in this act for a while.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Anderson, ''Stories from the Nerve Bible'' (Perennial 1993)&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufman initially approached the head of the [[World Wrestling Federation]], [[Vince McMahon Sr.]], about bringing his act to the New York wrestling territory.&lt;ref name="apter"&gt;{{cite web|date=October 21, 2015|last=Johnson|first=Vaughn|title=Bill Apter recounts legendary career in new book|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/the-squared-circle/Bill-Apter-recounts-legendary-career-in-new-book.html|website=The Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon dismissed Kaufman's idea as the elder McMahon was not about to bring "show business" into his Pro Wrestling society.&lt;ref name="apter"/&gt; Kaufman had by then developed a friendship with wrestling reporter/photographer Bill Apter.&lt;ref name="apter"/&gt; After many discussions about Kaufman's desire to be in the pro wrestling business, Apter called Memphis wrestling icon [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] and introduced him to Kaufman by telephone.&lt;ref name="apter"/&gt;

Kaufman finally stepped into the ring (in the [[Continental Wrestling Association|Memphis wrestling circuit]]) with a man—Lawler himself.&lt;ref name="cnn2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/07/us/kaufman-lawler-wrestling-match/|title=The Great Ruse: The comedic genius who rocked wrestling|first=Wayne|last=Drash|publisher=CNN|date=April 7, 2012|accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman taunted the residents of Memphis by playing "videos showing residents how to use soap" and proclaiming the city to be "the nation's [[redneck]] capital".&lt;ref name="cnn2012"/&gt; The ongoing Lawler-Kaufman [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]], which often featured [[Jimmy Hart]] and other [[heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] in Kaufman's corner, included a number of staged "[[List of professional wrestling terms#W|works]]", such as a broken neck for Kaufman as a result of Lawler's [[piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] and a famous on-air fight on a 1982 episode of ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmHCx8lCl8Y|title=kaufman-lawler|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=2012-03-24|accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=July 30, 1982|title=Andy Kaufman in New Fray with Wrestler on TV Show|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/30/arts/andy-kaufman-in-new-fray-with-wrestler-on-tv-show.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time after that first match, Kaufman appeared wearing a neck brace,&lt;ref name="cnn2012"/&gt; insisting that his injuries were much worse than they really were. Kaufman would continue to defend the Inter-Gender Championship in the [[Mid-South Coliseum]] and offered an extra prize, other than the $1,000: that if he were pinned, the woman who pinned him would get to marry him and that Kaufman would also shave his head.&lt;ref name="klfeud2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p5KMZe8n0o|title=The Kaufman Lawler Feud: Chapter 2&amp;nbsp;– The Fourth One|date=January 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually it was revealed that the feud and wrestling matches were staged works,&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Scott (November 15, 2013). [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-jerry-lawler-why-his-andy-kaufman-wrestling-match-resonated-20131115-story.html "Jerry Lawler: Why his Andy Kaufman wrestling match still resonates"]. ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Kaufman and Lawler were friends. This was not disclosed until more than 10 years after Kaufman's death, when the Emmy-nominated documentary ''A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman'' aired on [[NBC]] in 1995. [[Jim Carrey]], who revealed the secret, later went on to play Kaufman in the [[1999 in film|1999 film]] ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]].'' In a 1997 interview with the ''Memphis Flyer'', Lawler said he had improvised during their first match and the ''Letterman'' incident.

Although officials at St. Francis Hospital stated that Kaufman's neck injuries were real, in his 2002 biography ''It's Good to Be the King ... Sometimes'', Lawler detailed how they came up with the [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] and kept it quiet. Even though Kaufman's injury was legitimate, the pair exaggerated it. He also said that Kaufman's furious tirade and performance on ''Letterman'' was Kaufman's own idea, including when Lawler slapped Kaufman out of his chair. Promoter [[Jerry Jarrett]] later recalled that for two years, he would mail Kaufman payments comparable to what other main-event wrestlers were getting at the time, but Kaufman never deposited the checks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f4wonline.com/component/content/article/27559-sept-24-2012-observer-newsletter-huge-story-on-history-of-jerry-lawler-in-memphis-biggest-matches-and-angles-plus-all-the-news-from-the-past-week-night-of-champions-and-more "(Title unknown)"], Wrestling Observer Figure Four Online; accessed January 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufman appeared in the 1983 film ''[[My Breakfast with Blassie]]'' with professional wrestling personality [[Freddie Blassie|"Classy" Freddie Blassie]]. The film was a parody of the art film ''[[My Dinner with Andre]].'' Lynne Margulies, sister of the film's director, [[Johnny Legend]], appears in it, and became romantically involved with Kaufman.

In 2002, Kaufman became a playable character in the video game ''[[Legends of Wrestling II]]'' and a standard character in 2004's ''[[Showdown: Legends of Wrestling]]''. In 2008, [[Jakks Pacific]] produced for their WWE Classic Superstars toy line an action figure two-pack of Kaufman and Lawler, as well as a separate figures release for each of them.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Appearances===
Although Kaufman made a name for himself as a guest on [[NBC]]'s ''Saturday Night Live'', his first prime-time appearances were several guest spots as the "Foreign Man" on the [[Dick Van Dyke]] variety show ''Van Dyke and Company'' in 1976.&lt;ref name="vandyke"&gt;{{cite web|date=September 20, 1976|last=Sharbutt|first=Jay|title=Van Dyke springs hour of lunacy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19760920&amp;id=4rYrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A-YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6644,3134911|publisher=''Lawrence Journal-World''|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared four times on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' in 1976–78, and three times on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' in 1972, 1977, and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://comedy-and-humor.com/andy-kaufman/|title=Andy Kaufman - Comedy and Humor|work=Comedy and Humor|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman appeared on ''[[The Dating Game]]'' in 1978, in character as Foreign Man, and cried when the bachelorette chose Bachelor #1, protesting that he had answered all the questions correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Andy Kaufman en The Dating Game (1978) (Subtitulado)|date=2016-04-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUUZNGbpc84|accessdate=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''SNL'' appearances started with the [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|first show, on October 11, 1975]]. He made 16 ''SNL'' appearances in all, doing routines from his comedy act, such as the Mighty Mouse singalong, Foreign Man, and the Elvis impersonation. After he angered the audience with his female-wrestling routine, Kaufman in January 1983 made a pretaped appearance (his 16th) asking the audience if he should ever appear on the show again, saying he would honor their decision. ''[[Saturday Night Live|SNL]]'' ran a phone vote, and 195,544 people voted to "Dump Andy" while 169,186 people voted to "Keep Andy".&lt;ref name="passion_tally"&gt;{{cite video|people=Alan Graham (producer)|date=February 21, 2008|title=The Passion of Andy Kaufman|url=http://www.stickam.com/subcin|format=[[SWF]]|medium=Archive footage|publisher=Subterranean Cinema|accessdate=March 20, 2008|time=2:20:00|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005174736/http://www.stickam.com/subcin|archivedate=October 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''SNL'' episode with the phone poll, many of the cast members stated their admiration for Kaufman's work. After [[Eddie Murphy]] read both numbers, he said, "Now, Andy Kaufman is a friend of mine. Keep that in mind when you call. I don't want to have to punch nobody in America in the face", and [[Mary Gross]] read the Dump Andy phone number at a rate so fast that audiences were unable to catch it. The final tally was read by [[Gary Kroeger]] to a cheering audience.

[[Laurie Anderson]] worked alongside Kaufman for a time in the 1970s, acting as a sort of "straight man" in a number of his [[Manhattan]] and [[Coney Island]] performances. One of these performances included getting on a ride that people stand in and get spun around. After everyone was strapped in, Kaufman would start saying how he did not want to be on the ride in a panicked tone and eventually cry.

==Personal life==
Kaufman never married. His daughter, Maria Bellu-Colonna (born 1969), was the child of an out-of-wedlock relationship with a high-school girlfriend and was placed for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailyentertainmentnews.com/tv/maria-colonna-kaufman-taxi-actor-andy-kaufmans-real-daughter/ "Maria Colonna Kaufman- Taxi Actor Andy Kaufman's real daughter"].

Lynne Margulies, who met Kaufman during the filming of his ''[[My Breakfast With Blassie]]'' (she was in the film), was in a relationship with Kaufman from 1982 until his death in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-creative-genius-both-man-on-the-moon-jim-and-andy-missed| title=The Creative Genius That Both 'Man on the Moon' and 'Jim &amp; Andy' Missed|first= Richard|last= Brody |date=November 20, 2017 | accessdate=December 3, 2017| work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margulies later co-directed the 1989 Kaufman wrestling compilation ''[[I'm From Hollywood]]'', and published the 2009 book ''Dear Andy Kaufman, I Hate Your Guts!''&lt;ref&gt;Margulies, Lynne; Zmuda, Bob. ''Dear Andy Kaufman, I Hate Your Guts!'' (December 1, 2009, Process Publishing), a book containing the letters sent to Kaufman challenging him to wrestle.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
At [[Thanksgiving]] dinner on [[Long Island]] in November 1983, several family members openly expressed worry about Kaufman's persistent [[coughing]]. He claimed that he had been coughing for nearly a month, visited his doctor, and been told that nothing was wrong. When he returned to Los Angeles, he consulted another physician, then checked himself into [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] for a series of medical tests. A few days later, he was diagnosed with [[Large-cell lung carcinoma|large-cell carcinoma]], an extremely rare type of lung cancer.

After audiences were shocked by his gaunt appearance during January 1984 performances, Kaufman acknowledged that he had an unspecified illness which he hoped to cure with [[natural medicine]], including a diet of all fruits and vegetables, among other measures. Kaufman received palliative [[radiotherapy]], but by then the cancer had spread from his lungs to his brain. His final public appearance was at the premiere of ''My Breakfast With Blassie'' in March 1984, where he appeared thin and had a partially shaved head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 4, 1984|last=Wolmuth|first=Roger|title=Andy Kaufman 1949–1984|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20087990,00.html|publisher=''People''|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, he and Lynne Margulies flew to [[Baguio]], Philippines, where as a last resort, Kaufman received treatments of a pseudoscientific procedure called [[psychic surgery]].

Kaufman died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on May 16, 1984, at the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=May 16, 2004|last=Carpenter|first=Les|title=Squiggy is in the house: 'Laverne and Shirley' star now M's scout|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/sports/2001930270_squiggy16.html|publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]''|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimesobituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clifton"/&gt;

==Death-hoax rumors==
Kaufman often spoke of [[Faked death|faking his own death]] as a grand hoax, with rumors persisting, often fueled by sporadic appearances of Kaufman's character Tony Clifton at comedy clubs after his death.&lt;ref name=CNNdeathhoax&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/14/showbiz/andy-kaufman-alive-or-not/index.html|title=Andy Kaufman's brother says he is victim of hoax|first=Wayne|last=Drash|publisher=CNN|date=November 15, 2013|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AndyKaufmanDeathCertificate.gif|thumb|150px|Death Certificate of ''Andy Kaufman'']]

"Clifton" performed a year after Kaufman's death at [[The Comedy Store]] benefit in Kaufman's honor, with members of his entourage in attendance, and during the 1990s made several appearances at Los Angeles nightclubs. [[Jim Carrey]], who portrayed Kaufman in ''Man on the Moon'', stated on the NBC special ''Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman'' that the person doing the Clifton character was [[Bob Zmuda]]. Kaufman's official website states that his death was not a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andykaufman.jvlnet.com/final.htm|title=The Last Days of Andy Kaufman|publisher=Andykaufman.jvlnet.com|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, responding to rumors following the appearance of an actress who claimed to be Kaufman's daughter and that he was still alive, [[Los Angeles County Coroner]]'s office re-released Kaufman's death certificate to confirm he was indeed deceased and buried at [[Beth David Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="TSGDeathCert"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/deathcert/kaufman,%20andy_dc.pdf|format=PDF|title=Certificate of Death: Andrew G.

In 2014, Zmuda and Lynne Margulies, Kaufman's girlfriend at the time of his death, coauthored ''Andy Kaufman: The Truth, Finally'', a book claiming that Kaufman's death was indeed a prank, and that he would soon be revealing himself, as his upper limit on the "prank" was 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/09/28/why-andy-kaufman-might-still-be-alive|title=Friend: Andy Kaufman is still alive|accessdate=October 5, 2014|author=Getlen, Larry|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] in ''A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman'' said of him: "No one has ever done what Andy did, and did it as well, and no one will ever.

No. Because nobody's doing what he did. Jim Carrey was influenced—not to do what Andy did, but to follow his own drummer. I think Andy did that for a lot of people. Follow your own drumbeat.

'''Astana Giribangun''', (also "Giri Bangun"), is a [[mausoleum]] complex for the [[Suharto]] family of former [[President]] of the [[Republic of Indonesia]].
It is located in Karang Bangun, Matesih, [[Karanganyar Regency]], [[Central Java]] province on the slopes of [[Mount Lawu]], approximately 35 kilometres east of [[Surakarta]]. The archaic [[Javanese language|Javanese]] prose title translates as "Palace of the risen mountain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kompas.com/read.php?cnt=.xml.2008.01.27.20194337&amp;channel=1&amp;mn=1&amp;idx=1 |website=kompas.com }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure is in traditional [[Java]]nese architectural style and occupies parts of the [[Mangkunegaran]] Royal Cemetery complex.  It is approximately 300 metres from the burial sites of the [[Solonese]] royals [[Mangkunegara I]], II and III. Former Indonesian President Suharto was buried in Astana Giribangun on 29 January 2008 with full state military honours following his death in Jakarta the day before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/01/28/surakarta-stops-soeharto039s-entourage.html |title=Surakarta stops for Soeharto's entourage |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] presided over the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/01/28/royal-farewell-soeharto.html |title=Royal farewell to Soeharto |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suharto was buried beside his late wife, [[Siti Hartinah|Mrs (Ibu) Tien Soeharto]] (Siti Hartinah Soeharto, who had died on April 28, 1996) and her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/nasional/2008/01/28/brk,20080128-116371,id.html |website=tempointeraktif.com |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810143854/http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/nasional/2008/01/28/brk,20080128-116371,id.html |archive-date=2009-08-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with traditional Javanese practice, Suharto's family held a memorial ceremony at the Astana Giribangun in October 2010, 1,000 days after Suharto's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/10/23/govt-urged-clear-soeharto%E2%80%99s-name.html |title=Government urged to clear Soeharto's name |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=3 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119183423/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/10/23/govt-urged-clear-soeharto%E2%80%99s-name.html |archivedate=2015-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of the site caused some controversy at the time.  Many Javanese believed Ibu Suharto not to be of true noble blood but, rather, the descendent of a faithful court servant (who was born a commoner). The Mangkunegaran Court reconciled this controversy by decreeing that Suharto could indeed build an Astana (''istana'' in bahasa Indonesia, or ''palace'') but that it could not be any higher than a pre-existing royal tomb, Astana Mangadeg, near the Astana Giribangun was to be established. The Astana Mangadeg was considered to in a location with special spiritual features by many [[dukun]], spiritualists and soothsayers for the strongly [[kejawen]] or [[kebatinan]] [[Suharto]] to meditate and derive charisma or ''[[shakti]]'' (magic).&lt;ref&gt;Astana Giribangun''.

[[File:Child Saint Sambandar (915580465).jpg|thumbnail|The Child Saint [[Sambandar]], [[Chola]] dynasty, [[Tamil Nadu]]. from Freer Gallery of Art, Washington DC, He is one of the most prominent of the sixty-three [[Nayanars]] of the [[Saiva]] bhakti movement.]]

The '''Bhakti movement''' refers to the [[theism|theistic]] devotional trend that emerged in medieval [[Hinduism]]{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}} and later revolutionised in [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johar|first1=Surinder|title=Guru Gobind Singh: A Multi-faceted Personality|date=1999|publisher=MD Publications|isbn=978-8-175-33093-1|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in eighth-century south India (now [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and spread northwards.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}} It swept over east and north India from the 15th century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=1-2}}

The Bhakti movement regionally developed around different gods and goddesses, and some sub-religions were [[Vaishnavism]] (Vishnu), [[Shaivism]] (Shiva), [[Shaktism]] (Shakti goddesses), and [[Smartism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lance Nelson (2007), An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies (Editors: Orlando O. Espín, James B. Nickoloff), Liturgical Press, {{ISBN|978-0814658567}}, pages 562-563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SS Kumar (2010), Bhakti - the Yoga of Love, LIT Verlag Münster, {{ISBN|978-3643501301}}, pages 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger (2009), [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/63933/bhakti Bhakti], Encyclopædia Britannica; [http://www.himalayanacademy.com/readlearn/basics/four-sects The Four Denomination of Hinduism] Himalayan Academy (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was inspired by many poet-saints, who championed a wide range of philosophical positions ranging from [[theistic dualism]] of [[Dvaita]] to absolute [[monism]] of [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=2}}&lt;ref name=novetzke&gt;Christian Novetzke (2007), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25691067 Bhakti and Its Public], International Journal of Hindu Studies, Vol. 11, No. 3, page 255-272&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement has traditionally been considered as an influential social reformation in Hinduism, and provided an individual-focused alternative path to spirituality regardless of one's caste of birth or gender.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=1-2}} Postmodern scholars question this traditional view and whether the Bhakti movement ever was a reform or rebellion of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 10-16&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest Bhakti movement was a revival, reworking and recontextualisation of ancient Vedic traditions.&lt;ref name=karen15/&gt;

Scriptures of the Bhakti movement include the [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Bhagavata Purana]] and [[Padma Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson (2005), Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gita and Images of the Hindu Tradition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415346719}}, pages 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=karen26&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 26-32, 217-218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The Sanskrit word ''bhakti'' is derived from the root ''bhaj'', which means "divide, share, partake, participate, to belong to".&lt;ref name="Prentiss"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pechilis Prentiss|first=Karen|title=The Embodiment of Bhakti|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=US|year=1999|page=24|isbn=978-0-19-512813-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Werner|first=Karel|title=Love Divine: studies in bhakti and devotional mysticism|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|pages=168|isbn=978-0-7007-0235-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word also means "attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation".&lt;ref name=monier&gt;[[Monier Monier-Williams]], Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, page 743&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=bhakti&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 bhakti] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the term ''Bhakti'' is analogous but different than [[Kama]]. Kama connotes emotional connection, sometimes with sensual devotion and erotic love. Bhakti, in contrast, is spiritual, a love and devotion to religious concepts or principles, that engages both emotion and intellection.&lt;ref name=karen20&gt;Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 19-21&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Pechelis states that the word Bhakti should not be understood as uncritical emotion, but as committed engagement.&lt;ref name="karen20"/&gt; Bhakti movement in Hinduism refers to ideas and engagement that emerged in the medieval era on love and devotion to religious concepts built around one or more gods and goddesses. One who practices ''bhakti'' is called a ''bhakta''.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual roots==
Ancient Indian texts, dated to be from the 1st millennium BCE, such as the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, the Katha Upanishad and the Bhagavad Gita mention Bhakti.&lt;ref name=madeleine/&gt;

===Shvetashvatara Upanishad===
[[Image:Shiva poet-saint devotee (2).jpg|thumb|A copper alloy sculpture of a Shiva Bhakti practitioner from [[Tamil Nadu]] (11th Century or later).]]
The last of three epilogue verses of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, 6.23, uses the word [[Bhakti]] as follows,

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
यस्य देवे परा भक्तिः यथा देवे तथा गुरौ &lt;nowiki&gt;।
तस्यैते कथिता ह्यर्थाः प्रकाशन्ते महात्मनः ॥ २३ ॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/श्वेताश्वतरोपनिषद् Shvetashvatara Upanishad 6.23] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

He who has highest Bhakti (love, devotion)&lt;ref name=paulcarus&gt;Paul Carus, {{Google books|96sLAAAAIAAJ|The Monist|PA514}}, pages 514-515&lt;/ref&gt; of ''Deva'' (God),
just like his ''Deva'', so for his ''Guru'' (teacher),
To him who is high-minded,
these teachings will be illuminating.
&lt;/poem&gt;

This verse is notable for the use of the word ''Bhakti'', and has been widely cited as among the earliest mentions of "the love of God".&lt;ref name=paulcarus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WN Brown (1970), Man in the Universe: Some Continuities in Indian Thought, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520017498}}, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref name=pauldeussenintro&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 301-304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maxmullerinto&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/n33/mode/2up The Shvetashvatara Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages xxxii - xlii&lt;/ref&gt; have debated whether this phrase is authentic or later insertion into the Upanishad, and whether the terms "Bhakti" and "God" meant the same in this ancient text as they do in the medieval and modern era Bhakti traditions found in India. Max Muller states that the word ''Bhakti'' appears only in one last verse of the epilogue, could have been a later insertion and may not be theistic as the word was later used in much later ''Sandilya Sutras''.&lt;ref name=maxmullerbhakti&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/n33/mode/2up The Shvetashvatara Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages xxxiv and xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt; Grierson as well as Carus note that the first epilogue verse 6.21 is also notable for its use of the word ''Deva Prasada'' (देवप्रसाद, grace or gift of God), but add that ''Deva'' in the epilogue of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad refers to "pantheistic Brahman" and the closing credit to sage Shvetashvatara in verse 6.21 can mean "gift or grace of his Soul".&lt;ref name=paulcarus/&gt;

The Upanishad includes verses wherein God can be identified with the Supreme (Brahman-Atman, Self, Soul) in Vedanta monistic theosophy, verses that support dualistic view of Samkhya doctrines, as well as the synthetic novelty of triple Brahman where a triune exists as the divine soul (Deva, theistic God), individual soul (self) and nature (Prakrti, matter).&lt;ref name=srinivasan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Siegel, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1398646 Commentary: Theism in Indian Thought], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pages 419-423&lt;/ref&gt; Tsuchida writes that the Upanishad syncretically combines monistic ideas in Upanishad and self-development ideas in Yoga with personification of Shiva-Rudra deity.&lt;ref&gt;R Tsuchida (1985), Some Remarks on the Text of the Svetasvatara-Upanisad, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies (印度學佛教學研究), Vol. 34, No. 1, pages 460-468, '''Quote:''' "The Svetasvatara-Upanisad occupies a highly unique position among Vedic Upanisads as a testimony of the meditative and monistic Rudra-cult combined with Samkhya-Yoga doctrines."&lt;/ref&gt; Hiriyanna interprets the text to be introducing "personal theism" in the form of Shiva Bhakti, with a shift to monotheism but in henotheistic context where the individual is encouraged to discover his own definition and sense of God.&lt;ref&gt;M.

==History==
[[File:Meerabai (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Meera]]bai is considered as one of the most significant [[Sant (religion)|sant]]s in the [[Vaishnava]] bhakti movement. She was from a 16th-century aristocratic family in [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref name=smpandey&gt;SM Pandey (1965), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1061803 Mīrābāī and Her Contributions to the Bhakti Movement], History of Religions, Vol. 5, No. 1, pages 54-73&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Bhakti movement originated in [[South India]] during the seventh to eighth century CE, spread northwards from Tamil Nadu through [[Karnataka]] and [[Maharashtra]], and gained wide acceptance in fifteenth-century [[Bengal]] and [[North India|northern India]].{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}}

The movement started with the Saiva [[Nayanars]]&lt;ref name="Embree"&gt;{{cite book|last=Embree|first=Ainslie Thomas | authorlink=Ainslie Embree|author2=Stephen N. Hay |author3=William Theodore De Bary |title=Sources of Indian Tradition|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1988|pages=342|isbn=978-0-231-06651-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Vaisnava [[Alvars]], who lived between 5th and 9th century AD. Their efforts ultimately helped spread ''bhakti'' poetry and ideas throughout India by the 12th–18th century CE.&lt;ref name="Embree" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flood|first=Gavin|title=An Introduction to Hinduism|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|pages=131|isbn=978-0-521-43878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alvars, which literally means "those immersed in God", were Vaishnava poet-saints who sang praises of Vishnu as they travelled from one place to another.&lt;ref name=olson/&gt; They established temple sites such as [[Srirangam]], and spread ideas about [[Vaishnavism]]. Their poems, compiled as Alwar Arulicheyalgal or [[Divya Prabhandham]], developed into an influential scripture for the Vaishnavas. The [[Bhagavata Purana]]'s references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on ''bhakti'', have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that ''bhakti'' movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Sheridan| first=Daniel| title= The Advaitic Theism of the Bhagavata Purana |publisher=South Asia Books |location=Columbia, Mo |year=1986 |isbn=81-208-0179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=[[J.

Like the Alvars, the [[Shaivism|Saiva]] Nayanar poets were influential. The ''[[Tirumurai]]'', a compilation of hymns on Shiva by sixty-three Nayanar poet-saints, developed into an influential scripture in Shaivism. The poets' itinerant lifestyle helped create temple and pilgrimage sites and spread spiritual ideas built around Shiva.&lt;ref name=olson&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Carl|title=The many colors of Hinduism: a thematic-historical introduction|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|year=2007|pages=231|isbn=978-0-8135-4068-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Tamil-Siva bhakti poets influenced Hindu texts that came to be revered all over India.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars state that the Bhakti movement's rapid spread in India in the 2nd millennium, was in part a response to the arrival of Islam&lt;ref&gt;Note: The earliest arrival dates are contested by scholars. They range from 7th to 9th century, with Muslim traders settling in coastal regions of Indian peninsula, to Muslims seeking asylum in Tamil Nadu, to raids in northwest India by [[Muhammad bin Qasim]]. See: Annemarie Schimmel (1997), Islam in the Indian subcontinent, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004061170}}, pages 3-7; Andre Wink (2004), Al-Hind: the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|90-04-09249-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent Islamic rule in India and Hindu-Muslim conflicts.&lt;ref name=encyclopediabrit/&gt;&lt;ref name=karen&gt;Karen Pechelis (2011), Bhakti Traditions, in The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies (Editors: Jessica Frazier, Gavin Flood), Bloomsbury, {{ISBN|978-0826499660}}, pages 107-121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnhawley/&gt; This view is contested by some scholars,&lt;ref name=johnhawley&gt;John Stratton Hawley (2015), A Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti Movement, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674187467}}, pages 39-61&lt;/ref&gt; with Rekha Pande stating that singing ecstatic bhakti hymns in local language was a tradition in south India before Muhammad was born.&lt;ref name=rekhapande/&gt; According to Pande, the psychological impact of Muslim conquest may have initially contributed to community-style bhakti by Hindus.&lt;ref name=rekhapande&gt;Rekha Pande (2014), Divine Sounds from the Heart—Singing Unfettered in their Own Voices, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-1443825252}}, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Yet other scholars state that Muslim invasions, their conquering of Hindu Bhakti temples in south India and seizure/melting of musical instruments such as [[cymbal]]s from local people, was in part responsible for the later relocation or demise of singing Bhakti traditions in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vasudha Narayanan (1994), The Vernacular Veda: Revelation, Recitation, and Ritual, The University of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|978-0872499652}}, page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Wendy Doniger]], the nature of Bhakti movement may have been affected by the "surrender to God" daily practices of Islam when it arrived in India.&lt;ref name=encyclopediabrit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/63933/bhakti Bhakti], Encyclopædia Britannica (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In turn it influenced devotional practices in Islam such as [[Sufism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Gavin Flood]]|title=The Blackwell companion to Hinduism|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003|page=185|isbn=978-0-631-21535-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other religions in India from 15th century onwards, such as [[Sikhism]], [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name="Neill 2002 412"&gt;Stephen Neill (2002), A history of Christianity in India, 1707-1858, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-89332-9}}, page 412&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name="Kelting 2001 87"&gt;Mary Kelting (2001), Singing to the Jinas: Jain laywomen, Maṇḍaḷ singing, and the negotiations of Jain devotion, Oxford University Press, page 87, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514011-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaus Witz, in contrast, traces the history and nature of Bhakti movement to the [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] and the Vedanta foundations of Hinduism. He writes, that in virtually every Bhakti movement poet, "the Upanishadic teachings form an all-pervasive substratum, if not a basis. We have here a state of affairs that has no parallel in the West. Supreme Wisdom, which can be taken as basically non-theistic and as an independent wisdom tradition (not dependent on the Vedas), appears fused with highest level of [[bhakti]] and with highest level of God realization."&lt;ref&gt;Klaus G Witz (1998), The Supreme Wisdom of the Upaniṣads: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120815735}}, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy: Nirguna and Saguna Brahman==
The Bhakti movement of Hinduism saw two ways of imaging the nature of the divine ([[Brahman]]) – ''Nirguna'' and ''Saguna''.&lt;ref name=karen21&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nirguna'' Brahman was the concept of the Ultimate Reality as formless, without attributes or quality.&lt;ref name=jeaneanefxxvii&gt;Jeaneane D. Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, pages xxvii-xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; ''Saguna'' Brahman, in contrast, was envisioned and developed as with form, attributes and quality.&lt;ref name=jeaneanefxxvii/&gt; The two had parallels in the ancient pantheistic unmanifest and theistic manifest traditions, respectively, and traceable to Arjuna-Krishna dialogue in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name=karen21/&gt;&lt;ref name=fowlernirgunasaguna&gt;Jeaneane D. Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, pages 207-211&lt;/ref&gt; It is the same Brahman, but viewed from two perspectives, one from ''Nirguni'' knowledge-focus and other from ''Saguni'' love-focus, united as Krishna in the Gita.&lt;ref name=fowlernirgunasaguna/&gt; ''Nirguna'' bhakta's poetry were ''Jnana-shrayi'', or had roots in knowledge.&lt;ref name=karen21/&gt; ''Saguna'' bhakta's poetry were ''Prema-shrayi'', or with roots in love.&lt;ref name=karen21/&gt; In Bhakti, the emphasis is reciprocal love and devotion, where the devotee loves God, and God loves the devotee.&lt;ref name=fowlernirgunasaguna/&gt;

Jeaneane Fowler states that the concepts of Nirguna and Saguna Brahman, at the root of Bhakti movement theosophy, underwent more profound development with the ideas of [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, particularly those of [[Adi Shankara]]'s Advaita Vedanta, [[Ramanuja]]'s Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, and [[Madhvacharya]]'s Dvaita Vedanta.&lt;ref name=jeaneanefxxvii/&gt; Two 12th-century influential treatises on bhakti were ''Sandilya Bhakti Sutra'' – a treatise resonating with Nirguna-bhakti, and ''Narada Bhakti Sutra'' – a treatise that leans towards Saguna-bhakti.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Frazier and Gavin Flood (2011), The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-0826499660}}, pages 113-115&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nirguna'' and ''Saguna'' Brahman concepts of the Bhakti movement has been a baffling one to scholars, particularly the ''Nirguni'' tradition because it offers, states David Lorenzen, "heart-felt devotion to a God without attributes, without even any definable personality".&lt;ref name=davidlorenzenns/&gt; Yet given the "mountains of ''Nirguni'' bhakti literature", adds Lorenzen, bhakti for ''Nirguna Brahman'' has been a part of the reality of the Hindu tradition along with the bhakti for ''Saguna Brahman''.&lt;ref name=davidlorenzenns&gt;David Lorenzen (1996), Praises to a Formless God: Nirguni Texts from North India, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791428054}}, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; These were two alternate ways of imagining God during the bhakti movement.&lt;ref name=karen21/&gt;

==Social impact==
The Bhakti movement was a devotional transformation of medieval Hindu society, wherein Vedic rituals or alternatively [[sannyasa|ascetic]] monk-like lifestyle for [[moksha]] gave way to individualistic loving relationship with a personally defined god.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=1-2}} Salvation which was previously considered attainable only by men of [[Brahmin]], [[Kshatriya]] and [[Vaishya]] castes, became available to everyone.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=1-2}} Most scholars state that Bhakti movement provided women and members of the [[Shudra]] and [[Untouchability|untouchable]] communities an inclusive path to spiritual salvation.{{sfnp|Iwao|1988|pp=184-185|ps=}} Some scholars disagree that the Bhakti movement was premised on such social inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Peter van der Veer (1987), [Taming the Ascetic: Devotionalism in a Hindu Monastic Order], Man, New Series, Vol. 22, No. 4, pages 680-695&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnhawley338/&gt;

Poet-saints grew in popularity, and literature on devotional songs in regional languages became profuse.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=1-2}} These poet-saints championed a wide range of philosophical positions within their society, ranging from theistic dualism of [[Dvaita]] to absolute [[monism]] of [[Advaita]] Vedanta.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=2}} Kabir, a poet-saint for example, wrote in [[Upanishad]]ic style, the state of knowing truth:{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=154-155}}

The impact of the Bhakti movement in India was similar to that of the Protestant Reformation of Christianity in Europe.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=2}} It evoked shared religiosity, direct emotional and intellection of the divine, and the pursuit of spiritual ideas without the overhead of institutional superstructures.&lt;ref&gt;John Hawley (2015), A Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti Movement, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674187467}}, pages 1-4 and Introduction chapter&lt;/ref&gt; Practices emerged bringing new forms of spiritual leadership and social cohesion among the medieval Hindus, such as community singing, chanting together of deity names, festivals, pilgrimages, rituals relating to [[Saivism]], [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaktism]].&lt;ref name="Embree" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2011), The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury, {{ISBN|978-1472511515}}, pages 22-23, 107-118&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these regional practices have survived into the modern era.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=1-2}}

===Seva, daana and community kitchens===
The Bhakti movement introduced new forms of voluntary social giving such as ''Seva'' (service, for example to a temple or ''guru'' school or community construction), ''[[Dāna]]'' (charity), and community kitchens with free shared food.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Mourdaunt et al, Thoughtful Fundraising: Concepts, Issues and Perspectives, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415394284}}, pages 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; Of community kitchen concepts, the vegetarian [[Langar (Sikhism)|Guru ka Langar]] introduced by [[Nanak]] became a well established institution over time, starting with northwest India, and expanding to everywhere Sikh communities are found.&lt;ref&gt;Gene Thursby (1992), The Sikhs, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004095540}}, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; Other saints such as [[Dadu Dayal]] championed similar social movement, a community that believed in [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence) towards all living beings, social equality, and vegetarian kitchen, as well as mutual social service concepts.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=181-189, 300}} Bhakti temples and [[matha]] (Hindu monasteries) of India adopted social functions such as relief to victims after natural disaster, helping the poor and marginal farmers, providing community labor, feeding houses for the poor, free hostels for poor children and promoting folk culture.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Anheier and Stefan Toepler (2009), International Encyclopedia of Civil Society, Springer, {{ISBN|978-0387939940}}, page 1169&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism, Shakti and the Bhakti movement==
Some scholars call [[Sikhism]] a Bhakti sect of Indian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;W. Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1997), A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism: Sikh Religion and Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700710485}}, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=davidlorenzen&gt;David Lorenzen (1995), 
Bhakti Religion in North India: Community Identity and Political Action, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791420256}}, pages 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; In Sikhism, "nirguni Bhakti" is emphasised – devotion to a divine without [[Gunas]] (qualities or form),&lt;ref name=davidlorenzen/&gt;&lt;ref name=hardip&gt;Hardip Syan (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E.

The ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'', the scripture of the Sikhs, contains the hymns of the Sikh gurus, thirteen Hindu bhagats, and two Muslim bhagats.&lt;ref&gt;E Nesbitt (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, pages 360-369&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Bhagats whose hymns were included in the Guru Granth Sahib, were bhakti poets who taught their ideas before the birth of Guru Nanak – the first of Sikh Guru. The thirteen Hindu bhagats whose hymns were entered into the text, were poet saints of the Bhakti movement, and included [[Ramananda]], [[Namdev]], [[Bhagat Pipa|Pipa]], [[Ravidas]], [[Bhagat Beni|Beni]], [[Bhagat Bhikhan|Bhikhan]], [[Bhagat Dhanna|Dhanna]], [[Jayadeva]], [[Bhagat Parmanand|Parmanand]], [[Bhagat Sadhana|Sadhana]], [[Bhagat Sain|Sain]], [[Surdas]], [[Trilochan]], while the two Muslim bhagats were [[Kabir]] and Sufi saint [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar|Farid]].&lt;ref name=shapiro924&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|year=2002|title=Songs of the Saints from the Adi Granth|publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society|pages=924, 925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahinder Gulati (2008), Comparative Religious And Philosophies : Anthropomorphism And Divinity, Atlantic, {{ISBN|978-8126909025}}, page 302;&lt;br&gt;HS Singha (2009), The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Hemkunt Press, {{ISBN|978-8170103011}}, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mann | first=Gurinder Singh | year=2001 | title=The Making of Sikh Scripture | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=United States | isbn = 978-0-19-513024-9 | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the 5,894 hymns in the Sikh scripture came from the Sikh gurus, and rest from the Bhagats.

==Buddhism, Jainism and Bhakti movement==
Bhakti has been a prevalent practice in various Jaina sects, wherein learned [[Tirthankara]] (''Jina'') and human ''gurus'' are considered superior beings and venerated with offerings, songs and [[Aarti|Āratī]] prayers.&lt;ref name=johncort/&gt; John Cort suggests that the ''bhakti'' movement in later Hinduism and Jainism may share roots in ''vandan'' and ''pujan'' concepts of the Jaina tradition.&lt;ref name=johncort&gt;John Cort, Jains in the World : Religious Values and Ideology in India, Oxford University Press, ISBN , pages 64-68, 86-90, 100-112&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval-era bhakti traditions among non-theistic Indian traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism have been reported by scholars, wherein the devotion and prayer ceremonies were dedicated to an enlightened guru, primarily Buddha and Jina Mahavira respectively, as well as others.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2011), The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury, {{ISBN|978-1472511515}}, pages 109-112&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karel Werner]] notes that ''Bhatti'' (Bhakti in Pali) has been a significant practice in [[Theravada]] Buddhism, and states, "there can be no doubt that deep devotion or ''bhakti / bhatti'' does exist in Buddhism and that it had its beginnings in the earliest days".&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner (1995), Love Divine: Studies in Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700702350}}, pages 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
Bhakti, according to William Dyrness, has been a "point of convergence" between Christian gospel tradition and the Hindu devotional tradition. It has helped Indian Christians devote themselves to God as distinct from his creation, and as a personal being to love, to expect grace from, through self-giving devotion.&lt;ref name="William"&gt;William A. Dyrness, Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen (Edited), ''Global Dictionary of Theology: A Resource for the Worldwide Church'', Inter Varsity Press, [[Nottingham]], 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ncqkZnDSeo4C&amp;lpg=PA422 p.422]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2017}} Songs were composed by poets such as A.J. Appasamy, Sadhu Sundar Singh and other early converts in the early twentieth century that were rich in lyrics and brought out the mysticism, legends and meaning of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="William"/&gt; According to Kugler, some of the pioneers of bhakti in Christian sects in India include Murari David.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna Sarah Kugler]], ''Guntur Mission Hospital, Guntur, India'', Women's Missionary Society, The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of America|United Lutheran Church in America]], 1928,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=vM5OAQAAMAAJ p.39]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and doubts in postmodern scholarship==
[[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] scholars question whether the 19th- and early 20th-century theories about Bhakti movement in India, its origin, nature and history is accurate. Pechilis in her book on Bhakti movement, for example, states&lt;ref name=karen13/&gt;

{{Quote|Scholars writing on bhakti in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were agreed that bhakti in India was preeminently a monotheistic reform movement. For these scholars, the inextricable connection between monotheism and reform has both theological and social significance in terms of the development of Indian culture. The orientalist images of bhakti were formulated in a context of discovery: a time of organised cultural contact, in which many agencies, including administrative, scholarly and [[Proselytism|missionary]] – sometimes embodied in a single person – sought knowledge of India. Through the Indo-European language connection, early [[orientalism|orientalists]] believed that they were, in a sense, seeing their own ancestry in the antique texts and "antiquated" customs of Indian peoples. In this respect, certain scholars could identify with the monotheism of bhakti. Seen as a reform movement, bhakti presented a parallel to the orientalist agenda of intervention in the service of the empire.
|Karen Pechilis|The Embodiment of Bhakti&lt;ref name=karen13&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Madeleine Biardeau]] states, as does Jeanine Miller, that Bhakti movement was neither a reform nor a sudden innovation, but the continuation and expression of ideas to be found in [[Vedas]], Bhakti marga teachings of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Katha Upanishad]] and the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]].&lt;ref name=madeleine&gt;Madeleine Biardeau (1994), Hinduism: The Anthropology of a Civilization (Original: French), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195633894}} (English Translation by Richard Nice), pages 89-91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Miller (1996), Does Bhakti appear in the Rgveda?: An enquiry into the background of the hymns, {{ISBN|978-8172760656}}; see also J Miller (1995), in Love Divine: Studies in 'Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism (Editor: Karel Werner), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700702350}}, pages 5, 8-9, 11-32&lt;/ref&gt;

John Stratton Hawley describes recent scholarship which questions the old theory of Bhakti movement origin and "story of south-moves-north", then states that the movement had multiple origins, mentioning [[Brindavan]] in north India as another center.&lt;ref&gt;John Stratton Hawley (2015), A Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti Movement, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674187467}}, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; Hawley describes the controversy and disagreements between Indian scholars, quotes Hegde's concern that "Bhakti movement was a reform" theory has been supported by "cherry-picking particular songs from a large corpus of Bhakti literature" and that if the entirety of the literature by any single author such as ''[[Basava]]'' is considered along with its historical context, there is neither reform nor a need for reform.&lt;ref name=johnhawley338&gt;John Stratton Hawley (2015), A Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti Movement, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674187467}}, pages 338-339&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheldon Pollock]] writes that the Bhakti movement was neither a rebellion against Brahmins and the upper castes nor a rebellion against the Sanskrit language, because many of the prominent thinkers and earliest champions of the Bhakti movement were Brahmins and from upper castes, and because much of the early and later Bhakti poetry and literature was in Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Pollock (2009), The Language of the Gods in the World of Men, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520260030}}, pages 423-431&lt;/ref&gt; Further, states Pollock, evidence of Bhakti trends in ancient southeast Asian Hinduism in the 1st millennium CE, such as those in Cambodia and Indonesia where Vedic era is unknown, and where upper caste Tamil Hindu nobility and merchants introduced Bhakti ideas of Hinduism, suggest the roots and the nature of Bhakti movement to be primarily spiritual and political quest instead of rebellion of some form.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Pollock (2009), The Language of the Gods in the World of Men, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520260030}}, pages 529-534&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keat Gin Ooi (2004), Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, {{ISBN|978-1576077702}}, page 587&lt;/ref&gt;

John Guy states that the evidence of Hindu temples and Chinese inscriptions from 8th century CE about Tamil merchants, presents Bhakti motifs in Chinese trading towns, particularly the [[Kaiyuan Temple (Quanzhou)]].&lt;ref name=johnguy/&gt; These show Saivite, Vaishnavite and Hindu Brahmin monasteries revered Bhakti themes in China.&lt;ref name=johnguy&gt;John Guy (2001), The Emporium of the World: Maritime Quanzhou, 1000-1400 (Editor: Angela Schottenhammer), Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004117730}}, pages 283-299&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars increasingly are dropping, states Karen Pechilis, the old premises and the language of "radical otherness, monotheism and reform of orthodoxy" for Bhakti movement.&lt;ref name=karen15/&gt; Many scholars are now characterising the emergence of Bhakti in medieval India as a revival, reworking and recontextualisation of the central themes of the Vedic traditions.&lt;ref name=karen15&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The comic contained graphic depictions of a variety of taboo and gory subject matters.&lt;ref name="FF37"&gt;{{Citation |date=August 1990 |periodical=[[Factsheet Five]] |issue=44 |pages=74 |issn=0890-6823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldofzines"&gt;{{Citation |last=Gunderloy |first=Mike |first2=Cari |last2=Goldberg Janice |title=The World of Zines |url= |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin Group |location=New York |isbn=978-0-14-016720-7 |chapter=Splatter, Death &amp; Other Good News |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It effectively became the first comic book in the United States to cause its creator to be convicted for artistic obscenity.&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pangburn |first1=DJ |title=The Obscene Comic That Got Its Artist Thrown in Jail Is Back |url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/d38dyz/the-obscene-comic-that-got-its-artist-thrown-in-jail-is-back |website=Creators |publisher=[[Vice Media]] |accessdate=November 8, 2018 |language=en-us |date=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/diana_mike.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1990 review, Mike Gunderloy of ''[[Factsheet Five]]'' called ''Boiled Angel'' "a prime candidate for banning in the 90s."&lt;ref name="FF37" /&gt; In 1993, a copy of ''Boiled Angel'' #8 (or "Ate") found its way into the hands of Florida Assistant State's Attorney [[Stuart Baggish]].

He was sentenced to community service and three years of supervised [[probation]].&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39350">'''Sexual orientation''' has been a pivotal issue for '''Conservative Judaism''' since the 1980s. A major Jewish denomination in the U.S., [[Conservative Judaism]] has wrestled with [[homosexuality]] and [[bisexuality]] as a matter of [[Jewish law]] and institutional policy. As with other [[Homosexuality and Judaism|branches of Judaism debating the acceptability of sexual orientations other than heterosexuality]], Conservative Jews faced both long-standing, rabbinic prohibitions on homosexual conduct as well as increasing demands for change in the movement's policies toward gays, bisexuals, and lesbians. Previously, the Conservative movement had changed its [[Role of women in Judaism#Conservative Judaism|policies toward women]], for example, by allowing the ordination of women as rabbis in 1983. Similarly, the Conservative leadership has been asked to stop discriminating against gay, bisexual, and lesbian people. This goal has been partially completed with the approval of the ordination of gay, bisexual, and lesbian rabbis in 2006 and of same-sex marriage ceremonies under [[Conservative Halakha|Jewish law]] in 2012; However, the Conservative decision did not call same-sex marriages kiddushin, the traditional Jewish legal term for marriage, because that act of consecration is nonegalitarian and gender-specific. In the traditional kiddushin ceremony, a pair of blessings is recited and the bridegroom gives his bride a ring, proclaiming that he is marrying his bride “according to the laws of Moses and Israel.”.&lt;ref name="jta.org 1"&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/06/04/3097171/conservative-rabbinic-group-issues-guidelines-for-same-sex-wedding-rituals Ben Sales, "Conservative rabbinic group issues guidelines for same-sex wedding rituals", JTA, June 4, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservative Halakhah on Sexual Orientation ==
In [[Conservative Judaism]], the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS) of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] makes the movement's decisions concerning [[Conservative Halakha|Jewish law]]. The CJLS consistently refused to pass several proposed [[takkanah|takkanot]] concerning the Levitical prohibitions on male-male [[anal sex]], but also on all forms of homosexual intimacy in general. In 1992, the CJLS action affirmed its traditional prohibition on homosexual conduct, blessing same-sex unions, and ordaining openly gay, bisexual, and lesbian clergy. However, these prohibitions grew increasingly controversial within the Conservative movement. Regarding ordination, a major criticism for LGBT ordination is not that members of the LGBT movement are not decent individuals. Rather, a widely held view is that Rabbis must be an example for the community, and it would be in direct opposition to the prohibition of gay sex to ordain someone who violates that Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.keshetuk.org/denominational-perspectives.html|title=Denominational Perspectives|website=KeshetUK|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of liberal proposals had been brought forth in the non-Orthodox community, including some by Rabbinical Assembly rabbis. Some argued that a change in Jewish understanding and law on this issue must change due to new information about the biology and genetics concerning [[human sexuality]]. Others argued that a change was required solely on ethical grounds. No such papers were accepted by the CJLS, as Conservative Judaism sees itself as bound by halakhah.

However, these arguments were soon expanded upon within more formal halakhic [[responsa]], one of the most prominent by Rabbi [[Bradley Shavit Artson]]. He used historical, sociological and ethical considerations to argue that homosexuality, as it is now understood today, was not described by the Torah, or understood by traditional rabbis. As such, one would be able to restrict the understanding of the Torah prohibition to cases not being considered today. His views were considered important, but they were not accepted, by themselves, as halakhically convincing. A few years later Rabbi [[Elliot N. Dorff]] used these arguments in his case for re-evaluating Conservative Judaism's stand on sexual orientation, but held that Artson's paper was insufficiently halakhically rigorous. Dorff studied the issue of coercion, arguing that people who were innately homosexual due to biology were not to be regarded as sinning. His early papers on the subject began to gain acceptance among a minority of RA rabbis, but ultimately it was made clear that the CJLS would not accept this argument as sufficient.

Two additional papers, one by Rabbi [[Gordon Tucker]] and one by Rabbis [[Myron Geller]], [[Robert Fine]], and David Fine, went further than Dorff's paper. Tucker's paper stated that it is necessary to expand the definition of the halakhic process, and the Geller, Fine, and Fine paper redefined the corpus of Halakha as the representing the evolving beliefs and ideals of the Jewish people of a particular time and place as distinct from representing an infallible Divine will. While both papers had the support of at least 6 members, a majority of the CJLS found that both papers represented so extensive a change that they could not be accepted as a mere changes of Jewish law, but each should be regarded as a [[Takkanah]] that would uproot a Torah prohibition if passed.  Under the CJLS rules, once a majority of the committee found a responsum to be a Takkanah, accepting it would require a majority of the Committee (13 of 25 votes), while an ordinary responsum could be accepted as a valid alternative with as few as 6 of 25 votes.

On December 6, 2006, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] adopted diametrically opposed responsa on the issue of sexual orientation. The CJLS's action permits each congregational rabbi and rabbinical school to decide which responsum to adopt and hence set its own policy on the subject. The adoption of dual, contradictictory responsa represents a straddling of the contemporary societal divide over sexual matters. It also represents a sharp change from previous Conservative policy, which in 1993 had adopted a consensus position reaffirming a blanket prohibition on homosexual conduct while welcoming gay, bisexual, and lesbian people as members.

=== The Dorff, Nevins, and Reisner responsum ===
One responsum, by Rabbis [[Elliot N. Dorff]], [[Daniel Nevins]], and [[Avram Reisner]], reduced the extent of traditional restrictions and substantially changed Conservative views on homosexual conduct. It characterized most such restrictions as rabbinic in character. It found rabbinic restrictions subject to reconsideration by the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards|CJLS]] under its interpretation of the principle of [[Kavod HaBriyot]], the Talmudic rule of legal reasoning that rabbinic (but not Biblical) restrictions can be overridden on the basis of "respect for others" or "human dignity". Holding that the concept of ''kavod habriyot'' interpreted as human dignity reflects Conservative Judaism's evolving understanding of human nature, it found rabbinic restrictions on homosexual conduct inconsistent with human dignity contemporarily understood and accordingly declared such restrictions lifted. Finding that it lacked authority under the ''kavod habriyot'' principle to lift biblical prohibitions, it analyzed the Biblical passages involved and found that male-male [[anal sex]] was the sole ''De'oraitha''  (Biblical) restrictions. It held that as a Biblical prohibition such conduct remained prohibited in Conservative Judaism. The responsum permitted Conservative rabbis to allow same-sex union ceremonies, and gave the option for Conservative rabbinical schools to admit and ordain openly gay, bisexual, and lesbian rabbis. It held that same-sex couples should be presumed not to engage in prohibited conduct in the same way that Conservative Judaism presumes that married heterosexual couples observe sexual prohibitions such as [[Niddah]].&lt;ref name="Dorff"&gt;[http://www.rabbinevins.org/HHH%20Dorff%20Nevins%20Reisner%20Final2.pdf Elliott N. Dorff, Daniel Nevins, and Avram Reisner. ''Homosexuality, Human Dignity, and Halakha.'' Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604193252/http://www.rabbinevins.org/HHH%20Dorff%20Nevins%20Reisner%20Final2.pdf |date=June 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The responsum begins with a quote from Rabbi Abraham Yitzhak HaKohen Kook,

:The light of the Messiah, when it blazes in the heart, teaches one to dignify all people: “It shall be on that day that the root of Jesse will stand as a sign to the nations, and peoples will seek him, and his consolation shall be dignity." (Isaiah {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|11:10|HE}})&lt;ref name="Dorff"/&gt;

After a discussion of contemporary theories of sexuality and a warning against promiscuity, the responsum interprets [[Leviticus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|18:22|HE}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|20:13|HE}} as pertaining to male-male anal sex only:

:Ancient authors employed euphemism when describing sex, making it difficult to prove exactly what activities they understood to be included within these verses. Is it possible that the biblical prohibition called ''mishk’vei ishah'' and later, by the Rabbis, ''mishkav zakhur'', includes actions other than anal intercourse? These verses have been variously translated, but almost all readers conclude that they prohibit anal sex between men, with the first verse addressing only the [[insertive partner]], and the second verse including the [[receptive partner]].&lt;ref name="Dorff"/&gt;

:We have demonstrated that only one form of homosexual intimacy, anal intercourse between men, is prohibited at this level as an ervah. We must conclude that any Jew who seeks to fulfill the Torah’s commandments must avoid this forbidden act.&lt;ref name="Dorff"/&gt;

The responsum also insisted that Jewish law could not be interpreted any more permissively:

:In contrast, our colleagues Rabbis David Fine, [[Robert Fine]] and [[Myron Geller]] have argued that the verses in Leviticus should be understood to prohibit only those sexual relationships that offer no possibility of marriage. In an age when gay marriage is permitted by some jurisdictions, they argue, the Torah’s ban is no longer universal. Although they present their reading as “the ''p’shat'',” there is nothing simple or contextual about this interpretation. Nowhere does the passage mention marriage. The list of forbidden sexual relations includes menstrual sex, which can occur within a marital context. It is hard to accept that the Torah forbids bestiality only because it offers no opportunity for marriage. This reading, too, is sui generis — unsupported by either ancient or modern commentaries.&lt;ref name="Dorff"/&gt;

The responsum described rabbinic prohibitions on sexual relations as mere fences, many of which, it said, the Conservative movement had already lifted. It compared Rabbinic prohibitions on homosexual conduct to strictures on a husband approaching or touching his wife during the [[Niddah]] (post-menstrual) period:

:However, our community does not enforce, and indeed does not accept, these severe prohibitions. We do not hold, as a matter of fact, that the laws of ”approach” are biblically mandated, but rather that they are in the category of rabbinic fences and borders that are all ultimately intended to protect against transgression of the fundamental biblical rules about sexual conduct. Just as the Sages of old exempted themselves from some of the severity of the laws against contact between the sexes between relatives,45 so have we concluded that average people can be trusted to maintain appropriate relations despite social kissing and hugging and moments alone together, even behind locked doors.

This teshuvah makes a distinction between a Torah mitzvah and later rabbinical fence laws. It argues (page 8) that:

:"We conclude that there is only one prohibited sexual relation of arayot among homosexual behaviors, which is anal sex between men, and that other restrictions have no basis in biblical legislation. ...While some readers might conclude from the texts reviewed above that Jewish law imposes a universal and undifferentiated ban on all homosexual intimacy, we must emphasize the nuances found in this literature. ...The Torah’s most severe sexual prohibitions are identified as ''ervah'' (plural: ''arayot''). In antiquity, these were punishable by death as well as by the severe divine penalty known as ''karet''. Of these sexual prohibitions alone did the rabbis teach, ''yeihareig v’al ya’avor'', that one should die rather than transgress. We have demonstrated that only one form of homosexual intimacy, anal intercourse between men, is prohibited at this level as an ''ervah''..."

The responsum questioned whether requiring celibacy for same-sex couples was feasible, quoting Deutoronomy {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|30:11-14|HE}}:

:For this mitzvah which I command you today is not too grand for you, nor is it far away. It is not in heaven, that it be said, ‘who will ascend to heaven to get it for us, and teach us how to do it?’ It is not across the sea,...

The responsum invoked and extensively commented on the concept of ''[[Kevod HaBriyot]]'', "human dignity," noting that the concept is traditionally limited to Rabbinic enactments:

:So great is human dignity that it supersedes a negative commandment of the Torah. Yet no sooner is this potentially radical principle enunciated than it islimited specifically to the commandment that establishes rabbinic authority, , לא תסור “do not stray from the law they [i.e., the rabbis] teach you right or left.” This concern for human dignity is cited in both Talmuds to override certain injunctions, but it is not considered capable of overturning an explicit biblical rule.&lt;ref name="Dorff"/&gt;

After an extensive discussion of this principle, the responsum applies it to declare all rabbinic prohibitions on homosexual conduct overridden, leaving only what it finds to be the biblical one:

:It is not possible to set aside the explicit biblical prohibition on anal sex that is stated twice in Leviticus and frequently reaffirmed by the Rabbis. As we have shown, the ''kvod habriot'' principle supersedes rabbinic, not biblical law. Of course, there is a theoretical way to overturn biblical law via the legislative mechanism of ''takkanah'' (decree). We do not find this mechanism to be appropriate in our case, because takkanah requires the consent of the majority of the population, and this subject remains quite controversial in the observant Jewish community.

:However, the rabbinic restrictions upon gay men and lesbian women that result in a total ban on all sexual expression throughout life are in direct conflict with the ability of these Jews to live in dignity as members of the people of Israel. For this reason, the halakhic principle of ''[[Kavod HaBriyot|gadol k’vod habriot]]'' must be invoked by the CJLS to relieve their intolerable humiliation. We must make open and rigorous efforts to include gay and lesbian Jews in our communities, to provide a proper welcome and a legal framework for the normalization of their status in our congregations.

In conclusion, the responsum declined to rule on the status of same-sex relationships, but declared that "the celebration of such a union is appropriate."

:We are not prepared at this juncture to rule upon the halakhic status of gay and lesbian relationships. To do so would require establishing an entirely new institution in Jewish law that treats not only the ceremonies and legal instruments appropriate for creating homosexual unions but also the norms for the dissolution of such unions. This responsum does not provide kiddushin for same-sex couples. Nonetheless, we consider stable, committed, Jewish relationships to be as necessary and beneficial for homosexuals and their families as they are for heterosexuals. Promiscuity is not acceptable for either homosexual or heterosexual relationships. Such relationships should be conducted in consonance with the values set out in the RA pastoral letter on intimate relationships, “This Is My Beloved, This Is My Friend”: A Rabbinic Letter on Human Intimacy. The celebration of such a union is appropriate.

=== The Roth responsum ===
The CJLS also adopted two restrictive responsa, one as a majority and one as a minority opinion. The majority responsum, by Rabbi [[Joel Roth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rabbi Joel Roth, Homosexuality Revisited, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006 |url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Roth_Final.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422081604/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Roth_Final.pdf |archivedate=2007-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was also adopted by 13 votes. It maintained traditional prohibitions on homosexual conduct and forbade Conservative rabbis from blessing same-sex unions and rabbinical schools from ordaining gay, bisexual, and lesbian clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Forward - Conservative Panel Votes to Permit Gay Rabbis |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/conservative-panel-votes-to-permit-gay-rabbis/ |accessdate=2006-12-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208205536/http://www.forward.com/articles/conservative-panel-votes-to-permit-gay-rabbis/ |archivedate=2006-12-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 10, Rabbi Roth published an editorial in the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]]'s newsletter ''JTS News'' providing some of the reasoning behind his responsum and explaining why he resigned following the CJLS's vote."&lt;ref name="jta.org 2"&gt;[http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=17372&amp;intcategoryid=4 Rabbi Joel Roth, "Op-Ed: Law committee in its gay ruling stepped outside halachic framework", JTS News, December 10, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205030318/http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=17372&amp;intcategoryid=4 |date=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rabbi Roth, the central problem with the permissive responsum is that it adopted a claim that the Biblical prohibition on homosexual conduct is limited to anal sex only based on insufficient support in precedent, the view of only "one sage". Rabbi Roth argued that it is impermissible to adapt such a minority view:

:What divided us was the question of our right to adopt a legal stance attributed to one sage that the prohibitions against sexual behavior other than male intercourse are rabbinic in status, d’rabbanan, and not biblical, which attribution is itself open to serious question and is denied by most decisors.

Rabbi Roth also said that "Even if the prohibition against sexual behavior other than male intercourse is rabbinic in authority and not biblical, what justifies our abrogating that prohibition?" He argued that the Talmudic concept of [[Kavod HaBriyot]], which the permissive responsum used as justification for doing so, is simply not the same thing as the idea of "human dignity" in contemporary liberalism:

:In almost all of the cases in which the category is invoked, the claim is that X may violate the law out of deference to the honor of Y. In the case under discussion, X is to be entitled to violate the law out of deference to his own honor, for which claim there is no real precedent.

:What’s more, such a claim is theologically weak, since no law-abiding Jew would ever entertain the possibility that his honor would supersede that of God. And in the few cases of application of the category which can possibly be understood to imply that X may violate the law out of deference to his own honor, X is always literally in a social context and in the presence of others.

Rabbi Roth stated that in his perception, the supporters of the permissive responsum were blinded by their predisposition to rule favorably and were unable to view the issue with a dispassionate legal mind.

:How halachically defensible does an argument have to be before it can be considered within the halachic ballpark? We all understand and agree that decisors of Jewish law often approach the subject before them with a predisposition to give a specific answer. There’s nothing wrong with that, in my opinion. What, then, distinguishes a good decisor from a poor one? The good decisor is able to judge his decision with enough dispassion to see whether his predisposition has blinded him to the indefensibility of his answer, and the poor one is not. It is my opinion that my colleagues have here been blinded to the indefensibility of their conclusion. ."&lt;ref name="jta.org 1"/&gt;

Rabbi Roth argued that the halakhic legitimacy of the Conservative movement was at stake:

:What is at stake here, for me, and I believe for the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards as a body, is whether the Law Committee can continue to be seen as a halakhic decision-making body. For all of the breadth I believe that there is for pluralism within halakhah, some decisions are outside those boundaries. If we make such a decision, we are no longer legitimate halakhists, we undermine our authority as the interpreters of God’s will, and we render the Law Committee halakhically irrelevant.&lt;ref name="rabbinicalassembly.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rabbi Joel Roth, Homosexuality Revisited, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006 |url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Roth_Final.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422081604/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Roth_Final.pdf |archivedate=2007-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Roth ended by articulating what he regarded as the fundamental difference between the traditionalist and the liberal wings of the Conservative movement. From the traditionalist point of view, acceptance of the hypothesis that the Torah was transmitted through multiple manuscripts and redactors in no way changes its status as a Divine, "legally infallible" document, a "given" reality to which any theological theory must conform:

:That, then, brings us to the following issue: Assuming that the type of biblical scholarship we have all been taught is correct, does that mean that the Torah is, in fact, not Divine and legally infallible? I believe that it does not mean that. The argument here is over the following issue: Is theology the dog which wags the tail called halakhah, or is halakhah the dog which wags the tail called theology? It cannot be both ways.
:There can be no real doubt that normatively speaking the halakhic tradition is the given, and theology is required to fall into place behind it. Theology can, indeed, should, provide the narrative which makes the halakhic tradition intellectually persuasive and emotionally acceptable and satisfying, and that narrative can change as needed, and it need not be the same narrative for everyone. Narratives, after all, are aggadic, and thus, neither normative nor binding. That claim, incidentally, in no way diminishes their importance. Whatever narrative works is fine, so long as the narrative does not reverse which is the dog and which is the tail. In this enterprise we are again in a long chain: Sa’adia Ga’on did it, Yehuda ha-Levi did it, Maimonides did it, Samson Rafael Hirsch did it, David Zevi Hoffman did it, and Joseph Hertz did it. Our movement’s thinkers and theologians are as competent to provide a modern and persuasive theology of halakhah as were the thinkers of the past. But, we, like they, cannot undo the foundational premise of the entire halakhic system – that the Torah is Divine and legally infallible.&lt;ref name="rabbinicalassembly.org"/&gt;

=== The Levy responsum ===

Rabbi Leonard Levy's responsum, adopted as a minority opinion by six votes, delineated ways in which to ensure that gays and lesbians would be accorded human dignity and a respected place in Conservative communities and institutions while maintaining the authority of the traditional prohibitions against same-sex sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same Sex Attraction and Halacha|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Levy_Final.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-02-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613204535/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Levy_Final.pdf|archivedate=2007-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Tucker dissent ===

The CJLS rejected a proposed responsum by Rabbi [[Gordon Tucker]] which would have lifted all restrictions on homosexual conduct. Although it gained seven votes, the minimum to accept a responsum, it was classified as a [[takkanah]] (legislative decree) rather than a judicial interpretation. By CJLS procedural rules a takkanah requires 13 votes to pass. Accordingly, it was published as a dissenting opinion with a note that "concurring and dissenting opinions are not official positions of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Tucker_Final.pdf Rabbi Gordon Tucker, Halakhic and Metahalakhic Arguments Concerning Judaism and Homosexuality. The Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613204728/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Tucker_Final.pdf |date=June 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental premise of the dissenting opinion was that the Torah is not infallible, legally or otherwise, but is subject to reconsideration based on subsequent knowledge:

:When someone says, “What can we do? The Torah is clear on the subject!”, what is being said amounts to a claim of infallibility and irrefutability for the text of the Torah. And that claim ultimately rests on the assumption that the words of Leviticus (and, of course, those of the other four books of the Pentateuch) express directly and completely the will of God. (Indeed, treating a text as infallible on any basis other than on such an assumption would surely count as a form of idolatry.) But that assumption (that the Torah is the direct and complete expression of God’s will) is one that, for all its currency in parts of the Jewish world, is not accepted in our Conservative Jewish world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:No, the time has come for a movement that has finally published a Humash commentary that reflects the theology our masters have taught us to “come out of the closet”. It is past time for us to be, in the prophet Elijah’s words, “hopping between two opinions”. If the axiom behind this theological argument is to be accepted, then let us forthrightly admit that we have been misled by the teachers at whose feet we have sat. But if we confess that we do not accept the axiom of biblical infallibility, then let us honor our teachers by abandoning this theological argument, and by no longer permitting ourselves to say, when the matter of gays and lesbians comes up, “What can we do? The Torah is clear on the subject!” Could it perhaps be that critical study itself was given to us precisely so that we would not let the text of the Torah stand as an impediment to the acceptance, fulfilment, and normalization of God’s creatures?&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== The Geller, Fine, and Fine dissent ===
Rabbis [[Myron Geller]], [[Robert Fine]], and David Fine wrote a dissent arguing for complete abolition of strictures against homosexual conduct, and explicit recognition of same-sex religious commitment ceremonies, on grounds that strictures were no longer socially relevant and religious support was now socially required. The opinion characterized Halakha as

:a historically based religious/legal system that reflects the values, ethics and circumstances of the Jewish people at any particular period and whose evolving judgments, including those recorded in Scripture, are expressions of Jewish ideals in a given place and time.

The responsum argued that so regarded, Halakah can and should be updated to reflect changed values and social circumstances as they arise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Geller_Fine_Fine_Dissent_Final.pdf Geller, Myron, Fine, Robert, and Fine, David.

== Aftermath of the 2006 decisions ==
The consequences of the decision have been mixed, both in the U.S. and elsewhere.

On the one hand, four members of the Committee, Rabbis Joel Roth, Leonard Levy, [[Mayer Rabinowitz]], and [[Joseph Prouser]], resigned from the CJLS following adoption of the change.&lt;ref name="jta.org 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rothresigns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=17355&amp;intcategoryid=4 |title=Conflicting Conservative opinions expected to open the way for gays |accessdate=2006-12-07 |author=Ben Harris |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-12-06 |format= |work= |publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |pages= |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211044018/http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=17355&amp;intcategoryid=4 |archivedate=2006-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the [[Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies]] of the [[University of Judaism]] (now the [[American Jewish University]]) in Los Angeles had previously stated that it would immediately begin admitting gay, bisexual, and lesbian students as soon as the law committee passed a policy that sanctions such ordination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/conservative-panel-votes-to-permit-gay-rabbis/ "Conservative Panel Votes To Permit Gay Rabbis", ''The Jewish Daily Forward", December 7, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208205536/http://www.forward.com/articles/conservative-panel-votes-to-permit-gay-rabbis/ |date=December 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 26, 2007, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] in New York followed suit and began accepting openly gay, bisexual, and lesbian candidates for admission for their Rabbinical program .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jtsa.edu/about/communications/press/20062007/20070326.shtml Jewish Theological Seminary Press Release: "JTS to Accept Qualified Gay and Lesbian Rabbinical And Cantorial School Students", March 26, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818000000/http://www.jtsa.edu/about/communications/press/20062007/20070326.shtml |date=August 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, many Conservative synagogues outside of the US, which have historically been somewhat more traditional than the American movement, continued to maintain a complete ban on homosexual conduct, gay, bisexual, and lesbian clergy, and same-sex unions. The head of the Israeli Masorti Movement's ''Vaad Halakha'' (equivalent to the CJLS), Rabbi [[David Golinkin]], wrote the CJLS protesting its reconsideration of the traditional ban on homosexual conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscj.org/images/prouser.pdf Rabbi Joseph Prouser, ''The Conservative Movement and Homosexuality: Settled Law in Unsettling Times"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207161228/http://www.uscj.org/images/prouser.pdf |date=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Masorti movements in Argentina and the United Kingdom and the [[Neolog Judaism|Neologs]] in Hungary at first indicated that they will not admit or ordain homosexual rabbinical students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/overseas-seminaries-set-to-reject-gay-ordination/ "Overseas Seminaries Set To Reject Gay Ordination: Canadian Rabbis Mull Forming Separate Wing of Movement" ''The Jewish Daily Forward'', December 15, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Masorti Movement's Israeli Seminary also rejected a change in its view of the status of homosexual conduct, stating that "Jewish law has traditionally prohibited homosexuality." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3382340,00.html "No gay ordinations in conservative seminar", Y-net News, March 28, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Seminary reversed its position in April 2012, when it approved the ordination of gay, bisexual, and lesbian rabbis in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/21/jewish-movement-israel-oks-gay-rabbis.html Jewish movement in Israel OKs gay rabbis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422183113/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/21/jewish-movement-israel-oks-gay-rabbis.html |date=April 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2012, the American branch of [[Conservative Judaism]] formally approved same-sex marriage ceremonies in a 13-0 vote.{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref name="SSM"&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/religion/20120601_ap_conservativejewsapprovegayweddingguidelines.html?c=r Conservative Jews approve gay wedding guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; The British Masorti Movement voted to allow its rabbis to conduct same-sex marriages in 2014. However, each of the 12 Masorti communities will be free to decide, whether they want to conduct same-sex marriage or remain only with heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/124513/masorti-makes-history-rabbis-approve-same-sex-marriage Simon Rocker, "Masorti makes history as rabbis approve same-sex marriage", ''Jewish Chronicle'', October 22, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rights for LGBTQ Conservative Jews ==
The Torah mentions explicitly two times that male homosexuality is prohibited. Once in Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13, directed at men, but interpreted for both genders in the Conservative movement and Halacha overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalir|first=Doron|date=August 5, 2015|title=Same-Sex Marriage and Jewish Law: Time for a New Paradigm?|url=https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1815&amp;context=fac_articles|journal=Cleveland-Marshall College of Law|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While lesbian acts are never discussed directly in Biblical texts, the law extends to men and women based on religious interpretations of the text. The 2006 decision ruled on anal sex in particular, leaving room for interpretation for Jewish lesbian couples who do not participate in this act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabbis Elliot Dorff, Daniel Nevins and Avram Reisner|first=|date=Spring 2012|title=RITUALS AND DOCUMENTS OF MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Progress has been made for same-sex couples in Conservative Judaism, where they are now allowed to marry and receive guidance and support. In 2012, the Conservative movement endorsed gay marriage and provided guidelines for same-sex divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4237159,00.html|title=US Conservative Jews approve gay weddings|date=2012-02-06|work=Ynetnews|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While conservative Judaism blesses same-sex marriage, it still does not allow gay men to have anal sex precisely because of a verse in the Bible, and the movement recommends that bisexual people pursue heterosexual relationships. The Conservative movement also believes that heterosexuality is the ideal sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forward.com/news/371280/how-rabbis-are-trying-to-make-the-conservative-movement-more-gay-friendly/|title=How Rabbis Are Trying To Make The Conservative Movement More Gay-Friendly|work=The Forward|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Judaism does fall one step behind the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movement, where the Reform movement recognizes same-sex marriages as ''[[kiddushin]].'' The two Biblical verses continue to cause trouble for the Conservative movement's interpretation of this text. 

Regarding rights, in 2013, the [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism|USCJ]] found these results in Conservative synagogues:

* 80% of Conservative synagogues had membership policies allowing same-sex couples to have a family/household membership
* 60% reported they have members who openly identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or queer
* 14% of synagogues had trained staff on LGBTQ inclusion
* 30% had unisex/non-gendered bathrooms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uscj.org/leadership/keshet-leadership-project|title=LGBTQ Inclusion {{!}} USCJ|last=|first=|date=10-10-2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, many laws are governed by religious authorities, marriage included in this. Because religious law governs marriage, same-sex couples are not recognized as married by religious law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Recognition of same-sex unions in Israel|date=2018-10-22|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_Israel&amp;oldid=865222372|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some non-profit organizations: [[Shoval (organization)|Shoval]], [[Bat Kol (organization)|Bat Kol]], and [[Havruta (organization)|Havruta]] devoted to educating religious communities on acceptance and tolerance of the LGBT community in Israeli society. Among secular Israeli society, same-sex couples receive most of the same benefits as heterosexual couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbn.org.il/aliyahpedia/government-services/lgbtq-sex-couples-israel/|title=LGBTQ and Same-Sex Couples in Israel {{!}} Nefesh B'Nefesh|date=2018-02-21|work=Nefesh B'Nefesh|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, among the religious jurisdiction, same-sex couples cannot legally marry in Israel, barring them from being recognized as married by the religious authorities.

[[File:Agreda - Convento Concepcion 06.JPG|thumb|right|210px|Convent of the [[Conceptionists]] in [[Ágreda]] founded by [[Mary of Jesus of Ágreda]] (where her body rests [[incorruptibility|incorrupt]]).]]

A '''convent''' is either a community of [[priest]]s, [[Brother (Christian)|religious brothers]], [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|religious sisters]], or [[nun]]s; or the building used by the community, particularly in the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].

==Etymology and usage==
The term derives via Old French from Latin ''conventus'', perfect participle of the verb ''convenio'', meaning to convene, to come together. The original reference was to the gathering of mendicants who spent much of their time travelling. 
Technically, a "monastery" or "nunnery" is a community of monastics, whereas a "friary" or "convent" is a community of [[Mendicant orders|mendicants]], and a "[[canonry]]" a community of [[canon regular|canons regular]]. The terms "abbey" and "priory" can be applied to both monasteries and canonries; an abbey is headed by an Abbot, and a priory is a lesser dependent house headed by a Prior.

In English usage since about the 19th century the term "convent" almost invariably refers to a community of women,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=convent Etym on line]&lt;/ref&gt; while "[[monastery]]" and "[[friary]]" are used for men. In historical usage they are often interchangeable, with "convent" especially likely to be used for a friary. When applied to religious houses in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Buddhism]], English refers to all houses of male religious  as "monasteries" and of female religious "convents".

{{Taoism}}
'''De''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə}}; {{zh|c=德}}) is a key concept in [[Chinese philosophy]], usually translated "inherent character; inner power; integrity" in [[Taoism]], "moral character; virtue; morality" in [[Confucianism]] and other contexts, and "quality; virtue" (''[[guna]]'') or "merit; virtuous deeds" (''[[Merit (Buddhism)|punya]]'') in [[Chinese Buddhism]].

==The word==
Chinese ''de'' 德 is an ancient and linguistically complex word. The following analyzes it in terms of semantics, graphics, and [[etymology]].

===Meanings===
The ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'', defines twenty meanings for ''de'' 德, translatable as
# Rise, go up, climb, ascend. [升; 登.]
# Morals, morality, virtue, personal conduct, moral integrity, honor. [道德, 品行, 节操.]
# Denoting a wise/enlightened person with moral character. [指有道德的贤明之人.]
# Kindness, favor, grace, graciousness. [恩惠, 恩德.]
# Grateful, gratefulness, thankful, indebted. [感恩, 感激.]
# Benevolent rule, good government, good instruction. [德政, 善教.]
# Objective regulations/rules. [客观规律.]
# Quality, nature, basic character, characteristics, attribute. [性质; 属性.]
# Intention, purpose, heart, mind. For example: "Be of one heart and mind". [心意. 如:一心一德.]
# In [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]] theory, a reference to seasonally productive energy/air. [五行说指四季的旺气.]
# First growth, initial stage, beginning of something. [始生; 事物的开始.]
# A phoenix-head pattern/decoration. [凤凰头上的花纹.]
# Blessings, good fortune, happiness, resulting from benevolent actions. [福, 善庆的事.]
# Used for ''zhí'' "straight, just".  [通 "直 (''zhí'')".]
# Used for ''zhí'' "to plant, grow, establish". Plant a tree. [通 "植 (''zhí'')". 立木.]
# Used for "get, obtain, result in". [通 "得".]
# A national name. An abbreviation for the Republic of Germany during World War II. [国名. 第二次世界大战结束前的德意志联邦的简称.]
# A star name. [星名.]
# A river name. Another name for the Yellow River. [水名. 黄河之别名.]
# A surname. [姓.]
This dictionary provides early usage examples, and all of these ''de'' meanings occur in Han or pre-Han [[Chinese classic texts]], except for number 17 (''de'' abbreviating ''Deutschland'').

Translating ''de'' into English is problematic and controversial. [[Arthur Waley]] believed that ''de'' was better translated "power" than "virtue", and explained with a "bank of fortune" metaphor.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is usually translated 'virtue', and this often seems to work quite well; though where the word occurs in early, pre-moralistic texts such a translation is in reality quite false. But if we study the usage of the word carefully we find that ''de'' can be bad as well as good. What is a 'bad virtue'? Clearly 'virtue' is not a satisfactory equivalent. Indeed on examining the history of the word we find that it means something much more like the Indian ''karma'', save that the fruits of ''te'' are generally manifested here and now; whereas ''karma'' is bound up with a theory of transmigration, and its effects are usually not seen in this life, but in a subsequent incarnation. ''Te'' is anything that happens to one or that one does of a kind indicating that, as a consequence, one is going to meet with good or bad luck. It means, so to speak, the stock of credit (or the deficit) that at any given moment a man has at the bank of fortune. Such a stock is of course built up partly by the correct carrying out of ritual; but primarily by securing favourable omens; for unless the omens are favourable, no rite can be carried out at all. (1958:31)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on the cognate relation between ''de'' and ''zhi'' "to plant", Waley further noted the early Chinese regarded planting seeds as a ''de'', hence it "means a latent power, a 'virtue' inherent in something."

The linguist Peter A. Boodberg investigated the semantics and etymology of ''de''  德, which he called "perhaps the most significant word, next to ''tao'' 道, in ancient Chinese macro- and microcosmology."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The standard translation for it is "virtue," both in the sense of inherent quality and in that of moral excellence, but with the validity of the traditional rendering somewhat shaken by Arthur Waley's insistence on interpreting it as "power." Indeed, it is believed by many scholars that the term originated in the mytho-magical period of Chinese speculation when ''tê'' was conceived as a kind of ''mana''-like potency inherent in substances, things, and human beings, a potency which, on the one hand, made them true to their essence, and on the other, made possible their influencing of other entities. It appears often as if it had been imagined as a kind of electric charge permeating the thing in question, waxing or waning in accordance with some mysterious law, and capable of being transmitted, in the case of living beings, from one generation to another. Contrary-minded students of ancient Chinese philosophy dispute this interpretation as rather narrow and possibly anachronistic, and point to the fact that ''tê'' had early acquired, at least in Confucian literature, ethical connotations close to our "virtue," that is, as moral, and only rarely amoral or immoral, efficacy. They find, therefore, no quarrel with rendering ''tê'', almost invariably, as "virtue." Philologists are, however, troubled by the absence in the Chinese term of any connotations reminiscent of the Latin etymon ''vir'', such as manliness and virility. They remind us that ''tê'' is free from any contamination with sexual associations and differs in that from its great counterpart, ''tao'', the Way, which, in one or two expressions, such as ''jên tao'' 人道, "the way of men and women," is suggestive of sexual activity. Other recommended translation, such as "energy" and "essential quality," seem also inadequate from the etymological point of view. (1979:32) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Victor Mair explains that the difficulty of accurately translating ''de'',
&lt;blockquote&gt; …is evident from the astonishing sweep of thoughtful renderings of its meaning: power, action, life, inner potency, indarrectitude (inner uprightness), charisma, mana (impersonal supernatural force inherent in gods and sacred objects), [[Synderesis|sinderesis]] (conscience as the directive force of one's actions), and virtue, to name only a few of the brave attempts to convey the meaning of ''te'' in English. Of these, the last is by far the most frequently encountered. Unfortunately, it is also probably the least appropriate of all to serve as  an accurate translation of ''te'' in the ''Tao Te Ching''. (1990:133-4) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mair (1990:135) concludes that Daoist ''de'' is best translated "integrity", which "means no more than the wholeness or completeness of a given entity," and like ''de'', "it represents the selfhood of every being in the universe."

===Characters===
''De'' "power; virtue" is written with the [[Chinese character]] [[Wikt:德|德]] in both [[Traditional Chinese]] and [[Simplified Chinese]]. This character 德 combines the ''chi'' 彳 "footstep; go" [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] (recurring graphic elements that suggest meaning) with ''zhi'' 直 "straight; vertical" and ''xin'' 心 "heart; mind". ''De'' 德 has rare [[Variant Chinese character|variant characters]] of [[Wikt:徳|徳]] (without the horizontal 一 line) and [[Wikt:悳|悳]] or [[Wikt:惪|惪]] (without the 彳 "footstep" radical).

The earliest written forms of ''de'' 德 are [[oracle script]] from the [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600-1046 BCE) and [[bronzeware script]] and [[seal script]] from the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045-256 BCE). Oracle characters wrote ''de'' 德 with 彳"footstep; go" and 直 "straight", later bronze characters added the 心 "heart; mind" element. The oracle script for ''zhi''  直 "straight; vertical" ideographically depicted ''shu'' 丨"vertical line (in a character)" above ''mu'' 目 "eye", the bronze script elaborated the line into ''shi'' 十 "ten"', and the seal script separated the eye and heart with a horizontal line.

===Etymologies===
Boodberg (1979:33-4) undertook a "graphophonetic analysis" of ''de''. Based on the phonetic element ''zhi'' 直 "upright; erect" and the radical 行 suggesting movement, he translates ''de'' as English ''arrect'' "set upright; direct upward" (from Latin ''ad-'' "to") or ''insititious'' "ingrafted; inserted" potency (from Latin ''insitio'' "to implant; to graft"). Interpreting the 心 "heart; mind" to connote "innerness", he takes the prefix from Latin ''indoles'' "innate quality; natural disposition" to further neologize ''indarrect''. Boodberg concludes that the noun ''de'' is best translated ''enrective'' in the passive sense of power, or ''arrective'' in the active sense of influencing others. He says the Chinese understood ''de'' as potent but not coercive, and as arrective rather than corrective. Since early texts describe ''de'' 德 as an acquired quality, he proposes it is a [[paronym]] of ''de'' 得 "to acquire; to obtain", which is a common definition of ''de'' "power; virtue". Lastly, he notes a possible etymology of "see straight; looking straight at things; intuition" because early ''zhi'' 直 graphs depicted a straight line over an 目 "eye" (horizontally written 罒 in 德).

[[Victor H. Mair]] proposes a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] etymology for ''de''.
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''Te'' was pronounced approximately ''dugh''  during the early Chou period (about 1100 to 600 B.C.). The meanings it conveys in texts from that era are "character," "[good or bad] intentions," "quality," "disposition," "personality," "personhood," "personal strength," and "worth." There is a very close correlation between these meanings and words deriving from Proto-Indo-European ''dugh'' (to be fit, of use, proper; acceptable; achieve). And there is a whole series of words derived from the related Teutonic verbal root ''dugan''. There are Old High German ''tugan'', Middle High German ''tugen'', and modern German ''taugen'', all of which mean "to be good, fit, of use." There is another cognate group of words relating to modern English "doughty" (meaning worthy, valiant, stouthearted) that also contribute to our understanding of ''te''. They are Middle English ''douhti'', ''dohti'', of ''dühti'' ("valiant"). (1990:134) &lt;/blockquote&gt; In modern Dutch, the noun "de" can be translated as "deugd"; the verb "deugen" means 'to have virtue'.

According to Axel Schuessler's new etymological dictionary of Old Chinese (2007:208), ''de'' &lt; *''tək'' 德 "moral force, virtue, character; quality, nature" is probably in the same word family as ''de'' &lt; *''tək'' 得 "to get" and perhaps ''zhi'' &lt; *''drək'' 直 "straight; right". It quotes the proposal of [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank]] that ''de'' 德 and ''de'' 得 are cognate with [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] ''thub'' "a mighty one, one having power and authority".

==Taoist usages==
Classic texts of philosophical Daoism frequently refer to ''de''.

===The ''Daodejing''===
''De'' (德) is a keyword in the ''[[Daodejing]]'' where it occurs 44 times, compared to 76 occurrences of ''dao''. The title refers to a textual division between the ''Daojing'' (chapters 1-37, since 1 begins with ''dao'': "The Way that can be told") and the ''Dejing'' (chapters 38-81, since 38 begins with ''de'': "The man of highest "power", see below). The (relatively) modern compound word ''daode'' (道德) means "morality, ethical principles, ethics, moral philosophy". Two common ''de'' themes are its connection with the ''dao'' and its usefulness in managing people. (Note that ''de'' is "power" in the following translations by Arthur Waley.)

The first ''Daojing'' theme is the interrelationship between ''de'' and ''dao''. "Such the scope of the All-pervading Power. That it alone can act through the Way." (21, tr. Waley). The so-called "''De'' Chapter" has the greatest number of occurrences.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The man of highest "power" does not reveal himself as a possessor of "power";
Therefore he keeps his "power".
The man of inferior "power" cannot rid it of the appearance of "power";
Therefore he is in truth without "power".
The man of highest "power" neither acts nor is there any who so regards him; The man of inferior "power" both acts and is so regarded.
The man of highest humanity, though he acts, is not regarded;
Whereas a man of even the highest morality both acts and is so regarded;
While even he who is best versed in ritual not merely acts, but if people fail to respond
Then he will pull up his sleeves and advance upon them. That is why it is said:
"After Tao was lost, then came the 'power';
After the 'power' was lost, then came human kindness."
After human kindness was lost, then came morality,
After morality was lost, then came ritual. (38, tr. Waley)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here is another example.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Truly, if one uses the Way as one's instrument, the results will be like the Way; if one uses the "power" as instrument, the results will be like the "power". If one uses what is the reverse of the "power", the results will be the reverse of the "power".

For to those who have conformed themselves to the Way, the Way readily lends its power. To those who have conformed themselves to the power, the power readily, lends more power. While to those who conform themselves to inefficacy, inefficacy readily lends its ineffectiveness. (23, tr. Waley)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare this third example.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Tao gave them birth;
The "power" of Tao reared them,
Shaped them according to their kinds,
Perfected them, giving to each its strength.
Therefore of the ten thousand things there is not one that does not worship Tao and do homage to its "power". No mandate ever went forth that accorded to Tao the right to be worshipped, nor to its "power" the right to be worshipped, nor to its "power" the right to receive homage.
It was always and of itself so.
Therefore as Tao bore them and the "power" of Tao reared them, made them grow, fostered them, harboured them, brewed for them, so you must,
Rear them, but not lay claim to them,
Control them, but never lean upon them,
Be chief among them, but not manage them.
This is called the "mysterious power." (51, tr. Waley)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chapters 10 and 65 also use this ''xuande'' (玄德 "dark/mysterious ''de''") phrase.

The second ''Daodejing'' theme is the efficacy of ''de'' for statesmanship (see meanings 6 and 7 above). A sage ruler can acquire sufficient ''de'' to influence his subjects through, in effect, ''[[wu wei]]'' government.
&lt;blockquote&gt;You cannot rule men nor serve heaven unless you have laid up a store;
This "laying up a store" means quickly absorbing,
And "quickly absorbing" means doubling one's garnered "power".
Double your garnered power and it acquires a strength that nothing can overcome.
If there is nothing it cannot overcome, it know no bounds,
And only what knows no bounds is huge enough to keep a whole kingdom in its grasp. (59, tr. Waley) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare this description of using one's accumulated ''de'' to affect others.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The best charioteers do not rush ahead;
The best fighters do not make displays of wrath.
The greatest conqueror wins without joining issue;
The best user of men acts as though he were their inferior.
This is called the power that comes of not contending,
Is called the capacity to use men,
The secret of being mated to heaven, to what was of old. (68, tr. Waley) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mair interprets these ''de'' occurrences.
&lt;blockquote&gt; As it is used in the ''Tao Te Ching'', ''te'' signifies the personal qualities or strengths of the individual, one's personhood. ''Te'' is determined by the sum total of one's actions, good and bad. Therefore it is possible to speak of "cultivating one's ''te''." Like karma, ''te'' is the moral weight of a person, which may be either positive or negative. In short, ''te'' is what you are. ''Te'' represents self-nature or self-realization, only in relation to the cosmos. It is in fact the actualization of the cosmic principle in the self. ''Te'' is the embodiment of the Way and is the character of all entities in the universe. Each creature, each object has a ''te'' which is its own manifestation of the Tao. (1990:134-5)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The ''Zhuangzi''===
The ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' uses ''de'' 191 times. Many contexts praise Daoist "integrity; inner power", some mock Confucianist and Mohist "virtue", and others make ''de'' wordplays. One of the chapter titles is "''De chong fu''" (5, 德充符, "The Sign of Complete Virtue").

Several of the ''Zhuangzi'' translators (listed [[Zhuangzi (book)#Notable translations|here]]) explain the difficulties of rendering ''de'' into English. Frederic H. Balfour (1881:xxxvii) succinctly glosses ''de'' with Greek and Chinese.
&lt;blockquote&gt;德. In ethics, Virtue — ''ἀρετή'' [''[[arete (moral virtue)|areté]]'' "excellence"]; in physics, Energy — '' δύναμις'' [''dunamis'' "potential power; force"]. 道 ["The Tao"] is the 體 ["body; embodiment"] of which 德 is the 用 ["use; function"]. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
James Legge (1891:81) gives this footnote to the "''De'' Chapter".
&lt;blockquote&gt;論德, 'About the Attributes;' of Tâo, that is. It is not easy to render teh here by any other English term than 'virtue,' and yet there would be a danger of its thus misleading us in the interpretations of the chapter.&lt;br /&gt;
The 'virtue,' is the activity or operation of the Tâo, which is supposed to have come out of its absoluteness. Even Han Fei so defines it here, — 'Teh is the meritorious work of the Tâo.' &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Fung Yu-lan (1938:8) cites two examples.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Next, we come to the conception of ''Tê'', or virtue. Lao Tzŭ said:&lt;br /&gt;
"''Tao'' produces a thing; ''Tê'' maintains it." – "''Tao Tê Ching''," ''51''. &lt;br /&gt;
Chuang Tzŭ said:&lt;br /&gt;
"That which things get in order to live is called ''Tê''." – ''Chapter XII''. &lt;br /&gt;
So ''Tê'' is what an individual thing receives from ''Tao''. The total spontaneity of all things is ''Tao''. The spontaneity that an individual thing receives from ''Tao'' is ''Tê''. As some commentator said, the relation between ''Tê'' and ''Tao'' is just like that between the water in river or lake, and water in general. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Burton Watson (1968:25), whose translation will be cited below, describes the subtle connotations.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In nearly all cases I have rendered ''te'' as "virtue" except where it has the meaning of a favor or good deed done for someone, This word presents certain difficulties in Chuang Tzu. Sometimes he employs it to mean conventional virtue — that is, virtue in the Confucian or Mo-ist sense — in which case it has bad connotations; at other times he employs it in a good sense to mean the true virtue or vital power that belongs to the man of Tao. (Compare Waley's rendering of the title ''Tao-te-ching'' as ''The Way and Its Power''.) I prefer not to try to distinguish these two usages in the translation because I do not wish to impose upon the English a distinction that is not explicit in the original. The reader should keep in mind, incidentally, that the words "virtue" (''te'') and "gain" or "to get" (''te'') are homophones, and this fact is the basis of frequent puns and word plays — that is, the man of true Taoist virtue is one who, as we would say in English, has "got it."  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Victor H. Mair (1994:383) differentiates ''Zhuangzi'''s contextual usages of ''de''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In Confucian or conventional contexts, ''te'' is translated as "virtue." In Taoist or unconventional contexts, it is translated as "integrity." The most etymologically precise equivalent in English is the archaic word "dough[tiness]." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''De'' was central in Daoist cosmology, and the ''Zhuangzi'' frequently explains it with ''dao'' "the Way" and ''[[tian]]'' "heaven; god". Chapter 12, "Heaven and Earth", has two good illustrations.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Great Beginning, there was nonbeing; there was no being, no name. Out of it arose One; there was One, but it had no form. Things got hold of it and came to life, and it was called Virtue. Before things had forms, they had their allotments; these were of many kinds, but not cut off from one another, and they were called fates. Out of the flow and flux, things were born, and as they grew they developed distinctive shapes; these were called forms. The forms and bodies held within them spirits, each with its own characteristics and limitations, and this was called the inborn nature. If the nature is trained, you may return to Virtue, and Virtue at its highest peak is identical with the Beginning. Being identical, you will be empty; being empty, you will be great. You may join in the cheeping and chirping and, when you have joined in the cheeping and chirping, you may join with Heaven and earth. Your joining is wild and confused, as though you were stupid, as though you were demented. This is called Dark Virtue. Rude and unwitting, you take part in the Great Submission. (12, tr. Watson 1968:131-2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pervading Heaven and earth: that is the Way. Moving among the ten thousand things: that is Virtue. Superiors governing the men below them: that is called administration. Ability finding trained expression: that is called skill. Skill is subsumed in administration; administration in duty; duty in Virtue; Virtue in the Way; and the Way in Heaven. Therefore it is said, those who shepherded the world in ancient times were without desire and the world was satisfied, without action and the ten thousand things were transformed. They were deep and silent and the hundred clans were at rest. The Record says: "Stick to the One and the ten thousand tasks will be accomplished; achieve mindlessness and the gods and spirits will bow down." (12, tr. Watson 1968:126-7) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Zhide'' (至德 "perfect/ultimate ''de''") occurs seven times (see the punning proverb quoted below). For instance,
&lt;blockquote&gt;When a man has perfect virtue, fire cannot burn him, water cannot drown him, cold and heat cannot afflict him, birds and beasts cannot injure him. I do not say that he makes light of these things. I mean that he distinguishes between safety and danger, contents himself with fortune or misfortune, and is cautious in his comings and goings. Therefore nothing can harm him.

"Hence it is said: the Heavenly is on the inside, the human is on the outside. Virtue resides in the Heavenly. Understand the actions of Heaven and man, base yourself upon Heaven, take your stand in virtue, and then, although you hasten or hold back, bend or stretch, you may return to the essential and speak of the ultimate." (17, tr. Watson 1968:182-3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The people have their constant inborn nature. To weave for their clothing, to till for their food — this is the Virtue they share. They are one in it and not partisan, and it is called the Emancipation of Heaven. Therefore in a time of Perfect Virtue the gait of men is slow and ambling; their gaze is steady and mild. In such an age mountains have no paths or trails, lakes no boats or bridges. The ten thousand things live species by species, one group settled close to another. Birds and beasts form their flocks and herds, grass and trees grow to fullest height. So it happens that you can tie a cord to the birds and beasts and lead them about, or bend down the limb and peer into the nest of the crow and the magpie. In this age of Perfect Virtue men live the same as birds and beasts, group themselves side by side with the ten thousand things. Who then knows anything about "gentleman" or "petty man"? Dull and ununwitting, men have no wisdom; thus their Virtue does not depart from them. Dull and unwitting, they have no desire; this is called uncarved simplicity. In uncarved simplicity the people attain their true nature.

Then along comes the sage, huffing and puffing after benevolence, reaching on tiptoe for righteousness, and the world for the first time has doubts; mooning and mouthing over his music, snipping and stitching away at his rites, and the world for the first time is divided. Thus, if the plain unwrought substance had not been blighted, how would there be any sacrificial goblets? If the white jade had not been shattered, how would there be any scepters and batons? If the Way and its Virtue had not been cast aside, how would there be any call for benevolence and righteousness? If the true form of the inborn nature had not been abandoned, how would there be any use for rites and music? If the five colors had not confused men, who would fashion patterns and hues? If the five notes had not confused them, who would try to tune things by the six tones? That the unwrought substance was blighted in order to fashion implements — this was the crime of the artisan. That the Way and its Virtue were destroyed in order to create benevolence and righteousness — this was the fault of the sage. (9, tr. Watson 1968:105-6) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This parable blaming sages for losing the primordial ''dao'' and ''de'' has several ''Zhuangzi'' parallels. Here are two.
&lt;blockquote&gt;So it is said, With the sage, his life is the working of Heaven, his death the transformation of things. In stillness, he and the yin share a single Virtue; in motion, he and the yang share a single flow. He is not the bearer of good fortune, nor the initiator of bad fortune. Roused by something outside himself, only then does he respond; pressed, only then does he move; finding he has no choice, only then does he rise up. He discards knowledge and purpose and follows along with the reasonableness of Heaven. Therefore he incurs no disaster from Heaven, no entanglement from things, no opposition from man, no blame from the spirits. His life is a floating, his death a rest. He does not ponder or scheme, does not plot for the future. A man of light, he does not shine; of good faith, he keeps no promises. He sleeps without dreaming, wakes without worry. His spirit is pure and clean, his soul never wearied. In emptiness, nonbeing, and limpidity, he joins with the Virtue of Heaven.

So it is said, Grief and happiness are perversions of Virtue; joy and anger are transgressions of the Way; love and hate are offenses against Virtue. When the mind is without care or joy, this is the height of Virtue. When it is unified and unchanging, this is the height of stillness. When it grates against nothing, this is the height of emptiness. When it has no commerce with things, this is the height of limpidity. When it rebels against nothing, this is the height of purity. (15, tr. Watson 1968:168-9) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Yellow Emperor said, "Do-Nothing-Say‑Nothing — he's the one who is truly right. Wild-and-Witless appears to be so. But you and I in the end are nowhere near it. Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Therefore the sage practices the teaching that has no words. The Way cannot be brought to light; its virtue cannot be forced to come. But benevolence — you can put that into practice; you can discourse on righteousness, you can dupe one another with rites. So it is said, When the Way was lost, then there was virtue; when virtue was lost, then there was benevolence; when benevolence was lost, then there was righteousness; when righteousness was lost, then there were rites. Rites are the frills of the Way and the forerunners of disorder. So it is said, He who practices the Way does less every day, does less and goes on doing less, until he reaches the point where he does nothing, does nothing and yet there is nothing that is not done." Now that we've already become 'things,' if we want to return again to the Root, I'm afraid we'll have a hard time of it! The Great Man — he's the only one who might find it easy. (22, tr. Watson 1968:235) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This theme of sagely rulers using the powers of ''de'' recurs in the "Heaven and Earth" chapter.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Heaven and Earth are huge, but they are alike in their transformations. The ten thousand things are numerous, but they are one in their good order. Human beings are many, but they are all subjects of the sovereign. The sovereign finds his source in Virtue, his completion in Heaven. Therefore it is said that the sovereign of dark antiquity ruled the world through inaction, through Heavenly Virtue and nothing more. (12, tr. Watson 1968:126) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The man of kingly Virtue moves in simplicity and is ashamed to be a master of facts. He takes his stand in the original source and his understanding extends to the spirits. Therefore his Virtue is far‑reaching. His mind moves forth only when some external thing has roused it. Without the Way the body can have no life, and without Virtue, life can have no clarity. To preserve the body and live out life, to establish Virtue and make clear the Way — is this not kingly Virtue? Broad and boundless, suddenly he emerges, abruptly he moves, and the ten thousand things follow him — this is what is called the man of kingly Virtue. (12, tr. Watson 1968:128) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the Inner Chapters has a dialogue between [[Confucius]] and Duke Ai of [[Lu (state)|Lu]] (r. 494-468 BCE). The Duke describes meeting a hunchback named Ai Taito, who was famously ugly and charismatic, and asks about his incredible popularity, which the Master attributes to formless and water-like ''de''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said, "I once went on a mission to Ch'u, and as I was going along, I saw some little pigs nursing at the body of their dead mother. After a while, they gave a start and all ran away and left her, because they could no longer see their likeness in her; she was not the same as she had been before. In loving their mother, they loved not her body but the thing that moved her body. When a man has been killed in battle and people come to bury him, he has no use for his medals. When a man has had his feet amputated, he doesn't care much about shoes. For both, the thing that is basic no longer exists. When women are selected to be consorts of the Son of Heaven, their nails are not pared and their ears are not pierced. When a man has just taken a wife, he is kept in posts outside [the palace] and is no longer sent on [dangerous] missions. If so much care is taken to keep the body whole, how much more in the case of a man whose virtue is whole? Now Ai T'ai‑t'o says nothing and is trusted, accomplishes nothing and is loved, so that people want to turn over their states to him and are only afraid he won't accept. It must be that his powers are whole, though his virtue takes no form."

"What do you mean when you say his powers are whole?" asked Duke Ai.

Confucius said, "Life, death, preservation, loss, failure, success, poverty, riches, worthiness, unworthiness, slander, fame, hunger, thirst, cold, heat — these are the alternations of the world, the workings of fate. Day and night they change place before us and wisdom cannot spy out their source. Therefore, they should not be enough to destroy your harmony; they should not be allowed to enter the Spirit Storehouse. If you can harmonize and delight in them, master them and never be at a loss for joy, if you can do this day and night without break and make it be spring with everything, mingling with all and creating the moment within your own mind — this is what I call being whole in power."

"What do you mean when you say his virtue takes no form?"

"Among level things, water at rest is the most perfect, and therefore it can serve as a standard. It guards what is inside and shows no movement outside. Virtue is the establishment of perfect harmony. Though virtue takes no form, things cannot break away from it." (5, tr. Watson 1968:73-74) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Zhuangzi'' is famous for wordplay and witticism. Several passages make puns between ''de'' "obtain" and ''de'' "integrity; virtue" (see Watson 1968:183, 214). The "Autumn Floods" chapter quotes a "perfect ''de'' does not ''de''" (至德不得) proverb; "I have heard it said, 'The Man of the Way wins no fame, the highest virtue wins no gain, the Great Man has no self.' To the most perfect degree, he goes along with what has been allotted to him." (17, tr. Watson 1968:178-9). ''De'' derogatorily means "virtue; morality" in some contexts mocking the Confucians, [[Mohists]], and [[School of Names]]. For instance, this derision of their sophistry: "There is left, there is right, there are theories, there are debates, there are divisions, there are discriminations, there are emulations, and there are contentions. These are called the Eight Virtues." (2, tr. Watson 1968:44). Translating the witty words of ''Zhuangzi'' can be highly complex. A final instance mentions five types of ''xiongde'' (凶德 "bad/fiendish/terrible ''de''"), but only lists the first one ''zhongde'' (中德 "center/middle ''de''"). Compare these ''de'' translations by Watson ("virtue") and Mair ("integrity").
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no greater evil than for the mind to be aware of virtue, and to act as though it were a pair of eyes. For when it starts acting like a pair of eyes, it will peer out from within, and when it peers out from within, it is ruined. There are five types of dangerous virtue, of which inner virtue is the worst. What do I mean by inner virtue? He who possesses inner virtue will think himself always in the right, and denigrate those who do not do as he does. (32, tr. Watson 1968:359) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no greater affliction than for integrity to be possessed by the mind and for the mind to be possessed by its eye. Once ruled by the mind's eye, a person looks inward, and when she looks inward she is defeated. There are five types of malevolent integrity and the chief among them is egocentric integrity. What is meant by "egocentric integrity"? She who has egocentric integrity is possessed by self-love and ridicules whatever she does not do herself. (tr. Mair 1994:330) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The word ''bade'' 八德 "eight virtues/powers" first appears in the "Discussion on Making All Things Equal" chapter. Although many ''Zhuangzi'' commentators and translators try to give ''de'' "some special meaning other than its ordinary one of "virtue" in this context", notes Watson, "I believe Chuang Tzu is deliberately parodying the ethical categories of the Confucians and Mo-ists."
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Way has never known boundaries; speech has no constancy. But because of [the recognition of a] "this," there came to be boundaries. Let me tell you what the boundaries are. There is left, there is right, there are theories, there are debates, there are divisions, there are discriminations, there are emulations, and there are contentions. These are called the Eight Virtues. (2, tr. Watson 1968:43-44) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later Confucianists misread this Daoist context and moralistically interpreted ''bade'' as ''xiao'' 孝 "[[filial piety]]", ''di'' 悌 "sibling piety", ''zhong'' 忠 "loyalty; fidelity", ''xin'' 信 "trust; believe", ''li'' 禮 "ritual; rites; courtesy", ''yi'' 義 "righteousness; right conduct", ''lian'' 廉 "upright; honorable; integrity", and ''zhi'' 恥 "humility; shame".{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Confucianist usages==
The [[Four Books]] of Confucianism give some insightful explanations of ''de'' "virtue". Note that the following quotations cite [[Charles Muller]]'s scholarly translations of  the ''Analects'', ''Doctrine of the Mean'', ''Great Learning'', and ''Mencius''. The more familiar translations of [[James Legge]] render ''ren'' "[[Confucianism#Humaneness|humaneness]]; human-heartedness" as "perfect virtue", which occasionally creates confusion with ''de'' as "virtue". Compare their translations of these two ''Analects'' passages.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yen Yüan]] asked about [仁] perfect virtue. The Master said, "To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, all under heaven will ascribe perfect virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?" (12:1, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yen Yüan asked about the meaning of [仁] humaneness. The Master said, "To completely overcome selfishness and keep to propriety is humaneness. If for a full day you can overcome selfishness and keep to propriety, everyone in the world will return to humaneness. Does humaneness come from oneself, or from others?" (12:1, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, "Let the will be set on the path of duty. Let [德] every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped. Let [仁] perfect virtue be accorded with. Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts." (7:6, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "Set your aspirations on the Tao, hold to [德] virtue, rely on your [仁] humaneness, and relax in the study of the arts." (7:6, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The ''Analects''===
''De'' occurs 40 times in the Confucian ''Lunyu'' or ''[[Analects]]''. While Confucius extolled ''de'' "virtue; morality" — "If you are virtuous, you will not be lonely. You will always have friends." (4:25) — he frequently criticized his contemporaries for having lost it. He described ''de'' as something that one can augment, and praised sage kings who governed through its compelling powers.

Confucius claimed that the rulers of ancient China had ''zhide'' "perfect/ultimate ''de''" (see above). The two examples below mention the legendary [[Emperor Yao]] and [[Emperor Shun]], [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], the founder of the Zhou Dynasty, and Tai Bo, who ceded the throne to his nephew [[King Wen]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "T'ai Po can be said to have had a [至德] perfected level of virtue. He declined the rule of the kingdom three times, without the people knowing about it." (8:1) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shun, with five ministers, was able to successfully govern the empire. King Wu said, "Altogether I have ten ministers." Confucius said, "Their ability is the issue. Don't you think so? When the T'ang [Shang] and Wu [Zhou] dynasties combined, they had as many ministers as you, with a woman and nine men. King Wen (of the Chou) controlled two-thirds of the empire, and with this, served the Yin. Indeed, the [德] virtue of Chou can be called the [至德] epitome of virtue!" (8:20) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Good government is a central ''Analects'' topic, and the following citations illustrate the importance of ''de'' for rulers and officials.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it." (2:1) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "If you govern the people legalistically and control them by punishment, they will avoid crime, but have no personal sense of shame. If you govern them by means of virtue and control them with propriety, they will gain their own sense of shame, and thus correct themselves." (2:3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "The Superior Man cares about virtue; the inferior man cares about material things. The Superior Man seeks discipline; the inferior man seeks favors." (4:11) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone said: "What do you think of the saying: 'Repay harm with virtue'?" Confucius replied, "Then how will you repay virtue? Repay harm with Justice and repay virtue with virtue." (14:36) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chi K'ang Tzu asked Confucius about government saying: "Suppose I were to kill the unjust, in order to advance the just. Would that be all right?" Confucius replied: "In doing government, what is the need of killing? If you desire good, the people will be good. The nature of the Superior Man is like the wind, the nature of the inferior man is like the grass. When the wind blows over the grass, it always bends." (12:19) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this wind and grass simile, ''de'' clearly does not mean moral "virtue", but something like "nature; character". Compare these two semantically similar usages.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "Heaven gave birth to the virtue within me. What can Huan T'ui [who wanted to kill Confucius] do to me?" (7:22) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "The Southerners have a saying: 'If a man is not constant in his self-cultivation, he cannot be a shaman or a healer.' It is a good proverb. If you are not consistently developing your virtue, what can you give to others? You will not even be able to give a diagnosis." (13:22) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Confucius recurrently disparaged his [[Spring and Autumn period]] contemporaries for having diminished their natural ''de'' virtue. One notably ironic ''Analects'' passage accuses the Master himself of having lost it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chieh Yu, the madman of Ch'u, passed by Confucius, singing: "Phoenix! Phoenix! How your virtue has declined! Your past cannot be corrected, But your future is yet to come. Give up! Give up! Those who involve themselves in Government now Will be in danger." Confucius jumped down, wanting to talk to him, but he ran away, so Confucius couldn't talk to him. (18:5) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here are some Confucian quotations about the rarity of people who possessed true ''de'' "virtue".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "Yu, those who understand virtue are few and far between." (15:3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "Even over a long period of time, there have been few people who have actualized the Mean into Manifest Virtue." (6:27) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "I have never seen one who loves virtue as much as he loves sex." (9:17, repeated in 14:12) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "The virtuous will certainly have something to say, but those who have something to say are not necessarily virtuous. The humane man is always brave, but the brave man is not necessarily possessed of humaneness." (14.5) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "Clever words disrupt virtue. Lack of patience in small matters leads to the disruption of great plans." (15:26) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "The 'conventional townsman' is a thief of virtue." (17:13, cf. Mencius 7B:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "To apprehend the Tao and lecture on it before actualization is to throw away your accumulation of virtue." (17:14) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This last quote implies that ''de'' can be accumulated, and Confucius was not completely pessimistic about virtue going astray. For example (14:6), he praised his disciple [[Disciples of Confucius#Nangong Kuo|Nangong Kuo]] as "a Superior Man, a man of enhanced virtue." These four contexts describe ''de'' as a measurable force that one can "return," "cultivate," "extend," and "heighten".
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Tseng Tzu]] said: "When they are careful (about their parents) to the end and continue in reverence after (their parents) are long gone, the virtue of the people will return to its natural depth." (1:9) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "Having virtue and not cultivating it; studying and not sifting; hearing what is just and not following; not being able to change wrongdoing: these are the things that make me uncomfortable." (7:3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Tzu Chang said: "Keeping one's virtue without extending it; trusting the Tao without enriching it. What can you gain? And what can you get rid of?" (19:2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fan Chih, while strolling with the Master among the Rain Dance altars, said, "May I ask how to heighten virtue, overcome wickedness and resolve delusion?" The Master said, "An excellent question! If you take care of your responsibilities before you seek your own gain, won't this heighten your virtue? If you attack your own evil rather than the evil of others, won't you overcome wickedness? If, because of a moment's anger, you endanger your own life, as well as that of your parents, is this not delusion?" (12:21) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The ''Great Learning''===
The ''[[Da Xue]]'' or "Great Learning" is an early Confucianist text that was transmitted as a ''[[Liji]]'' chapter. The brief main passage, which is attributed to Confucius, repeats the phrase ''ming mingde'' (明明德 "brighten the bright ''de''"), which Legge translates "illustrate illustrious virtue".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The way of great learning consists in manifesting one's bright virtue, consists in loving the people, consists in stopping in perfect goodness. … The ancients who wanted to manifest their bright virtue to all in the world first governed well their own states. (tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The received ''Great Learning'' includes nine commentaries. The first one was supposedly written by [[Zeng Zi]], a disciple of Confucius. It explains ''mingde'' by quoting three ''[[Shujing]]'' sections, an otherwise unknown bathtub inscription of King [[Tang of Shang]], and a ''[[Shijing]]'' ode.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the "Announcement to K'ang" it is said, "He was able to [明德] manifest his virtue." The "T'ai-chia" says, "He contemplated Heaven's unveiled mandate." The "[[Canon of Yao]]" says, "he was able to [明峻德] manifest his lofty virtue." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The inscription of the bath of King T'ang said, "If you renew yourself for one day, you can renew yourself daily, and continue to do so." In the "Announcement of K'ang" it says, "carry out the renewal of the people." The ''Book of Odes'' says, "Even though Chou was an ancient state, its mandate was sustained anew." Therefore there is nothing in which the Superior Man does not fully exert himself. (tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The ''Doctrine of the Mean''===
The ''Zhongyong'' or ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'', which like the "Great Learning" above was included in the ''Liji'', uses ''de'' 22 times.

While Confucianist texts generally describe the ''de'' of humans, one passage portrays that of ''guishen'' (鬼神 "ghosts and spirits; gods").
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "The overabundance of the [德] power of spiritual beings is truly amazing! Looking for them, they cannot be seen. Listening for them, they cannot be heard. There is nothing that they do not embody. They cause the people of the world to fast for purification, and wear beautiful clothes in order to participate at the sacrifices. They are overflowing, seeming to be above, seeming to be on the left and on the right. The ''Book of Odes'' says: 'Trying to investigate the spirits, we cannot reach them. How could we possibly grasp them with our thoughts?' The manifestation of the subtle and the inconcealability of sincerity is like this."(16, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Note how the ''Doctrine of the Mean'' attributes almost mystical powers to ''cheng'' (誠 "sincerity; truth; honesty").
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sincerity is just 'perfecting' and the Way is just 'following.' Sincerity is the beginning and end of all things. Without sincerity there is nothing. Thus the Superior Man values the process of "becoming-sincere." But sincerity is not "just-perfecting"; it also means "perfecting all things." To perfect yourself, you need ''jen''. To perfect others, you need wisdom. The [德] virtue of our nature is that it is none other than the Way by which inner and outer are merged. Thus we can always use it to set things right. (25, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Only that person who has fully actualized sincerity is able to adjust the strings of the Great Net of the World; is able to establish himself in the Great Root of the World; is able to understand the transformations and the nurturing of Heaven and Earth. So sincere is his ''jen''; so unfathomable is his depth; so vast is his spaciousness. Who is able to understand this, but one who has the firm, acute, luminous sagely intelligence – who is permeated with [天德] Heavenly Virtue? (32, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two passages use the compound ''dade'' (大德 "big/great ''de'').
&lt;blockquote&gt;What a good son was Shun (the sage emperor)! His [德] virtue was that of a sage, he was venerated as an emperor. His wealth included everything within the [[Four Seas]]. He is sacrificed to in the ancestral temple, and his sons and grandsons have preserved his name. Therefore we can say that the [大德] greatly virtuous always attain their appropriate position, always receive their proper reward, always get their recognition and are always long-lived. (17, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius transmitted the legacy of (sage-emperors) Yao and Shun and modeled his character on that of (sage-kings) Wen and Wu. He was ruled by the Heavenly seasons from above, and combined the Earth and Waters below. He was like Heaven and Earth, which have nothing they do not support, and nothing they do not cover. His function was like the revolution of the four seasons, the alternation of sun and moon. He nourishes the myriad things and they grow up together without harming each other, and they follow their courses simultaneously without interfering with each other. His [小德] smaller power is like the rivers and streams. His [大德] great power is seen in deep transformations. This is why Heaven and Earth are called "great." (30, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Doctrine of the Mean'' also mentions the concept of ''zhide'' "perfect ''de''".
&lt;blockquote&gt;How great is the Way of the sage! Superabundant, it develops all things, extending up to Heaven. How excellent it is! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of conduct; it waits for the right person and then functions. Hence it is said: "If you do not [至德] perfect your virtue, the [至道] perfect Way cannot be actualized." Therefore the Superior Man esteems his [德] virtuous nature and follows the path of inquiry, extending himself in breadth and greatness, penetrating all subtleties, penetrating its height and brilliance, following the course of the actualization of the Mean. He reviews the old and learns the new, thickening his character through the valorization of propriety. (27, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The ''Mencius''===
''De'' 德 "virtue; character" occurs 41 times in the ''Mengzi'' or ''[[Mencius]]''. Many occurrences are in quotations, for instance 6A6 and 6A17 quote ''Shijing'' odes 260 and 247. Mencius frequently quotes Confucius about ''de''; 3A4 quotes the ''Lunyu'' 12:19 wind and grass metaphor, and 7B37 quotes 17:13 about "Conventional townsmen are thieves of virtue."  Three common ''de'' thematic usages are that wise rulers can utilize its powers, should employ people with ''de'', and should understand how it affects friendship.

The first and most frequent Mencian teaching is that a ruler should develop his ''de'' as a means of controlling people.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The king said: "What kind of [德] qualities are necessary for real kingship?" Mencius said: "Take care of the people, and no one can oppose you." (1A7, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was king Wen, moreover, with all the virtue which belonged to him; and who did not die till he had reached a hundred years — and still his influence had not penetrated throughout the kingdom. (2A1, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, "He who uses force as a pretense of Humaneness is the de-facto strongman among the princes. But such a strongman must have a large state in order to be effective. The man who uses his virtue to practice Humaneness is the true king. To be a real king you don't need an especially large territory. T'ang did it with only seventy li and King Wen did it with only one hundred li. When you use your power to force people into submission, they will never submit with their hearts; it is only because they don't have enough strength to resist. When people submit to virtue, they are happy from the bottom of their hearts, and they submit sincerely, the way the seventy disciples submitted to Confucius." (2A3, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'When right government prevails in the kingdom, princes of little virtue are submissive to those of great, and those of little worth to those of great. When bad government prevails in the kingdom, princes of small power are submissive to those of great, and the weak to the strong. Both these cases are the rule of Heaven. They who accord with Heaven are preserved, and they who rebel against Heaven perish. (4A7, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'People say, "When the disposal of the kingdom came to Yü, his virtue was inferior to that of Yâo and Shun, and he transmitted it not to the worthiest but to his son." Was it so?' Mencius replied, 'No; it was not so. When Heaven gave the kingdom to the worthiest, it was given to the worthiest. When Heaven gave it to the son of the preceding sovereign, it was given to him. … 'In the case of a private individual obtaining the throne, there must be in him virtue equal to that of Shun or Yü; and moreover there must be the presenting of him to Heaven by the preceding sovereign. It was on this account that Confucius did not obtain the throne.' (5A6, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'The administration of government is not difficult — it lies in not offending the great families. He whom the great families affect, will be affected by the whole State; and he whom any one State affects, will be affected by the whole kingdom. When this is the case, such an [sic] one's virtue and teachings will spread over all within the four seas like the rush of water.' (4A6, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'Confucius said, "The flowing progress of virtue is more rapid than the transmission of royal orders by stages and couriers."' (2A1, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Note how these last two examples describe rapidly flowing powers of ''de''.

The second related theme is that rulers should seek out and employ those individuals who have ''de''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;If a prince hates disgrace, the best course for him to pursue, is to esteem virtue and honour virtuous scholars, giving the worthiest among them places of dignity, and the able offices of trust. (2A2, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said: "Humaneness brings glory and non-Humaneness brings disgrace. So if you hate disgrace but still involve yourself in what is not Humaneness, it is like hating moisture and living in a basement. If you really hate it, you should honor virtue and respect the good. Install good men into positions of rank and give jobs to people of ability." (2A4, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore a prince who is to accomplish great deeds will certainly have ministers whom he does not call to go to him. When he wishes to consult with them, he goes to them. The prince who does not honour the virtuous, and delight in their ways of doing, to this extent, is not worth having to do with. (2B7, tr. Legge 214) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chien asked, "How do you go about 'just being content'?" Mencius said, "If you value virtue and enjoy Rightness, you can be content. Hence the gentleman in dire straits does not lose his sense of Rightness, and when successful, does not lose the Path. Since he does not lose his sense of Rightness when in dire straits, the gentleman is able to keep a grasp on himself. Since he does not lose the Path when he becomes successful, the people are not disappointed in him." (7A9, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hsien-ch'iû Mang asked Mencius, saying, 'There is the saying, "A scholar of complete virtue may not be employed as a minister by his sovereign, nor treated as a son by his father." … Mencius replied, 'No. These are not the words of a superior man. They are the sayings of an uncultivated person of the east of Qi.' (5A4, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A third theme in ''Mencius'' is the connection between ''de'' and friendship.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'I venture to ask the principles of friendship.' Mencius replied, 'Friendship should be maintained without any presumption on the ground of one's superior age, or station, or the circumstances of his relatives. Friendship with a man is friendship with his virtue, and does not admit of assumptions of superiority.' (5B12, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the frequent interviews of the duke Mû with Tsze-sze, he one day said to him, "Anciently, princes of a thousand chariots have yet been on terms of friendship with scholars — what do you think of such an intercourse?" Tsze-sze was displeased, and said, "The ancients have said, 'The scholar should be served:' how should they have merely said that he should be made a friend of?" When Tsze-sze was thus displeased, did he not say within himself, — "With regard to our stations, you are sovereign, and I am subject. How can I presume to be on terms of friendship with my sovereign! With regard to our virtue, you ought to make me your master. How can you be on terms of friendship with me?" Thus, when a ruler of a thousand chariots sought to be on terms of friendship with a scholar, he could not obtain his wish — how much less could he call him to his presence!' (5B16, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

One final example of Confucian ''de'' usages is this context where the word has a markedly negative meaning, semantically opposed to moral "virtue".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'Qiu acted as chief officer to the head of the Ji family, whose [德] evil ways he was unable to change, while he exacted from the people double the grain formerly paid.' (4A14, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In divination==
Several [[Mawangdui]] (before 168 BCE) texts named ''Xingde'' 刑德 ("Punishment and Virtue") describe De as a mantic function related to the [[sexagenary cycle]] and the astronomical notion of the ''Nine Palaces'' ([[:zh:九宮]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kalinowski.

{{Ancient Roman religion}}

Religion in the [[Greco-Roman world]] at the time of the [[Constantinian shift]] mostly comprised three main currents:

*the [[Religion in ancient Greece|traditional religions of ancient Greece]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Rome]];
*the official [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman imperial cult]];
*various [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]s, such as the [[Dionysian Mysteries|Dionysian]] and [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] and the mystery cults of [[Cybele]], [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithras]], and the [[syncretism|syncretized]] [[Isis]].

[[Early Christianity]] grew gradually in [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Rome]] and the [[Roman Empire]] from the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st]] to [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th]] centuries. In 313 it was [[Edict of Milan|legally tolerated]] and in 380 it became the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]]. Nevertheless,  [[Hellenistic]] polytheistic traditions survived in pockets of Greece throughout [[Late Antiquity]] until they gradually diminished after the triumph of Christianity.

==Before the Edict of Milan==
{{See also|Interpretatio graeca|Edict of Milan}}
The Romans tended towards [[syncretism]], seeing the same gods under different names in different places of the Empire, accommodating other Europeans such as the [[Hellenes]], [[Germanic tribes|Germans]], and [[Celts]], and Semitic and other groups in the Middle East. Under Roman authority, the various national myths most similar to Rome were adopted by analogue into the overall Roman mythos, further cementing Imperial control.  Consequently, the Romans were generally tolerant and accommodating towards new deities and the religious experiences of other peoples who formed part of their wider Empire.{{r|hughes}}

===The rise of esoteric philosophy===
The more philosophical outlook of the Hellenic parts of the Roman empire led to a renaissance of intellectual religious thought around the start of the 2nd century. Writings [[pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphically]] attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]], and discussing esoteric philosophy, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[alchemy]], began to spread from [[Roman Egypt]] throughout the empire; while they are difficult to date with precision, these texts are likely to have been [[redaction|redacted]] between the first and third centuries. Although such [[hermetica]] was generally written with the theological aim of spiritual improvement, each text had an anonymous, eclectic, and spontaneous origin, rather than being part of an organised movement.

A more organised form of [[alatrism|alatrist]] henotheistic panentheism emerged in parallel to Hermetism. In the 1st century BC [[Cicero]]'s friend [[Nigidius Figulus]] made an attempt to revive [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrines, an effort that was particularly successful under [[Apollonius of Tyana]] in the 1st century; within a century, supernatural powers were being ascribed to Apollonius, and accounts of his life had similarities to those of [[Jesus]]. At least one major meeting place for followers of this [[neopythagoreanism]] was built in Rome itself, near [[Porta Maggiore]], to a design similar to later Christian churches, though subterranean.

In the 2nd century, [[Numenius of Apamea]] sought to fuse additional elements of [[Platonism]] into Neopythagoreanism, a direction which [[Plotinus]] continued, forming [[neoplatonism]], a religion of [[theism|theistic]] [[monism]]. Neoplatonism began to be adopted by prominent scholars such as the Christian theologian [[Origen]] and the anti-Christian [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]. During the rule of [[Gallienus]], the imperial family themselves gave patronage to Plotinus, and encouraged his philosophical activities. Neoplatonism was further developed by [[Iamblichus]], who believed that [[theurgy|physical invocations]] would be able to produce [[soteriology|soteriological]] results, and therefore added religious ritual to the philosophy. Emperor [[Flavius Claudius Julianus|Julian]] tried to unify traditional Roman religion by mixing it with Iamblichus' form of neoplatonism; the influential Christian thinker [[Augustine of Hippo]] lived during this period, and his subsequent writings show heavy neoplatonic influence.

===Eastern sun-worship===
At some time around the first century, the members of the Roman military began to adopt the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cult]] of [[Mithraism]]; this sun-god related cult arose from obscure non-Roman origins, and the first surviving reference dates to [[Plutarch]]'s mention of a 67 BC observation of certain [[Mediterranean]] pirates practising it. As the Roman legions gradually moved around, so too Mithraism spread throughout the Roman Empire; in the beginning it was mainly soldiers who followed its precepts, but it was also adopted by freedmen, slaves, and merchants, in the locations where the legions rested, particularly in frontier areas.

Mithraism wasn't exclusive - it was possible and common to follow Mithraism and other cults simultaneously. It eventually became popular within Rome itself, gradually gaining members among the more aristocratic classes, and eventually counting some of the Roman senators as adherents; according to the [[Augustan History]], even the emperor [[Commodus]] was a member. Although, for reasons currently unknown, Mithraism completely excluded women, by the third century it had gained a wide following; there are over 100 surviving remains of [[mithraea|temples to Mithras]], 8 in Rome itself, and 18 in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] (Rome's main port), with Rome having over 300 associated Mithraic monuments.

From the reign of [[Septimius Severus]], other, less gender-specific, forms of sun-worship also increased in popularity throughout the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Halsberghe | first = Gaston H. | title = The Cult of Sol Invictus | year = 1972 | location = Leiden | pages = 36 |publisher= Brill }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elagabalus]] used his authority to install El-Gabal as the chief deity of the [[Roman pantheon]], merging the god with the Roman sun gods to form ''[[Sol Invictus|Deus Sol Invictus]]'', meaning ''God - the Undefeated Sun'', and making him superior to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]],&lt;ref name="dio-history-lxxx-11"&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-11 LXXX.11]&lt;/ref&gt; and assigning either [[Astarte]], [[Minerva]], [[Urania]], or some combination of the three, as El-Gabal's wife.&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-6"&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre506.html V.6]&lt;/ref&gt; He rode roughshod over other elements of traditional religion, marrying a [[Vestal Virgin]]&lt;ref name="dio-history-lxxx-9"&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-9 LXXX.9]&lt;/ref&gt; (who were legally required to remain unmarried virgins during their service),&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', Life of Numa Pompilius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Numa*.html#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt; and moved the most sacred relics of Roman religion (including the fire of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], the [[Ancile|Shields]] of the [[Salii]], and the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]]) to a new [[Elagabalium|temple dedicated exclusively to El-Gabal]].&lt;ref&gt;''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#3.4 3]&lt;/ref&gt; As much as the religiously conservative senators may have disapproved, the lavish annual public festivals held in El-Gabal's honour found favour among the popular masses, partly on account of the festivals involving the wide distribution of food.&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-6" /&gt;

Nearly half a century after Elagabalus, [[Aurelian]] came to power. He was a reformer, strengthening the position of the sun-god as the main divinity of the Roman pantheon; he even built a brand new temple, in Rome, dedicated to the deity. It's also thought likely that he may have been responsible for establishing the festival of ''the day of the birth of the unconquered sun'' (''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti''), which was celebrated on December 25, the day when the sun appears to start [[solar declination|rising again]] - four days after having previously [[solstice|reached its lowest point]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsanford.com/~wsanford/exo/sundials/DEC_Sun.html the sun's declination remains the same (to two decimal places) from 21 to 24 December, inclusive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906122535/http://www.wsanford.com/~wsanford/exo/sundials/DEC_Sun.html |date=6 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the earliest surviving reference to the festival is in the [[Chronography of 354]]. He followed the principle of ''one god, one empire''; his intention was to give to all the peoples of the Empire, civilian or soldiers, easterners or westerners, a single god they could believe in without betraying their own gods. [[Lactantius]] argued that Aurelian would have outlawed all the other gods if he had had enough time, but Aurelian only managed to hold on to the position of Emperor for five years.

===Judaism and Christianity===
{{See also|Split of early Christianity and Judaism}}
Imperial tolerance only extended to religions that did not resist Roman authority and would respect Roman gods. Religions that were hostile to the state or any that claimed exclusive rights to religious beliefs and practice were not included and some exclusive Eastern cults were persecuted. Jews were given special privileges owing to their dominance in economy, numbers and dispersal, but this tolerance was balanced unevenly on a thin veneer of Jewish submission. Tolerance of Judaism turned to persecution when collaboration was perceived as ending, see [[Anti-Judaism#In the pre-Christian Roman Empire|Anti-Judaism in the pre-Christian Roman Empire]]. Intolerant sects could also persecute each other; Jewish sects like the early Christians were denounced by the Jewish establishment as dangerous provocateurs, according to some interpretations of the [[Council of Jamnia]] and the [[Birkat haMinim]].  The results included massacres of Christian communities and Jewish nationalist groups.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

The early Christian community was perceived at times to be an intrinsically destabilising influence&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Brodd 1995"&gt;"Julian the Apostate and His Plan to Rebuild the Jerusalem Temple", Jeffrey Brodd, Biblical Archaeology Society, Bible Review, Oct 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and threat to the peace of Rome, a  ''[[religio illicita]]''.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; The pagans who attributed the misfortunes of Rome and its wider Empire to the rise of Christianity, and who could only see a restoration by a return to the old ways,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_02_letters11_20.htm#Letter17 "The Memorial of Symmachus"]&lt;/ref&gt; were faced by the Christian Church that had set itself apart from that faith and was unwilling to dilute what it held to be the religion of the "One True God".&lt;ref&gt;"Letter of Ambrose to the Emperor Valentinian", The Letters of Ambrose Bishop of Milan, 384AD, retrieved 5 May 2007.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_02_letters11_20.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The same gods whom the Romans believed had protected and blessed their city and its wider empire during the many centuries they had been worshipped were now [[demonization|demonized]] by the early Christian Church.&lt;ref&gt;"Devil Worship", Catholic Encyclopedia, 1908 Edition. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04767a.htm] The modern Church takes a much less belligerent stance to non-Abrahamic faiths. see ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]'' and ''[[Nostra aetate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toleration and Constantine==
{{main|Constantine I and Christianity}}
After the initial conflicts between the state and the new emerging religion, [[Gallienus]] (ruled 253 to 260) was the first emperor to issue an edict of toleration for all religious creeds including Christianity. According to Christian [[polemics|polemicists]] writing after his death, [[Constantine I]] was baptized on his deathbed, which would make him the first emperor to become a baptized Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04295c.htm "Constantine The Great", Catholic Encyclopedia, 1908]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/codex-theod1.html "The Codex Theodosianus On Religion", XVI.v.1, 4 CE]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]], a contemporary Christian historian, also praises him for having some pagan temples torn down.&lt;ref&gt;"he razed to their foundations those of them which had been the chief objects of superstitious reverence" http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.txt Book III Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, whatever the imperial edicts said, the effects of policy under the Christian emperors down to [[Valentinian I]] and [[Valens]] were enough to cause a widespread trend to Christian conversion, but not enough to make paganism extinct. Actual persecution was sporadic and generally the result of local initiative, for example [[Martin of Tours]]' destructions of holy sites in Gaul in the later fourth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~eknuth/npnf2-11/sulpitiu/lifeofst.html#14 Life of St. Martin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Official orders may have established an understanding that actual persecution would be tolerated, but in the first century of official Christianity did not generally organize it.

By the [[Edict of Milan]] (313 AD), Constantine continued the policy of toleration, which Galerius had established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gbgm-umc.org/UMW/Bible/milan.stm The Edict of Milan, complete text in English (Constantine, 313 AD)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717025539/http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/Bible/milan.stm |date=17 July 2007 }}. Gbgm-umc.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; His legislation against magic and private divination were driven out of a fear that others might gain power through those means.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus 2.29.1-2.29.4, [[Theodosian Code]] 16.10.1. Laws against the private practice of divination by Roman citizens had been enacted ever since the time of the emperor [[Tiberius]]. It was his fear that Roman citizens would fall outside of the official public Roman religion, accept foreign cults in their private family practices, and in turn corrupt the general Roman state.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, this did not mean he or other Roman rulers disfavored divination.  Instead, his belief in ''Roman'' divination is confirmed by legislation calling for the consultation of [[augurs]] after an [[amphitheatre]] had been struck by lightning in the year 320.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Constantine explicitly allowed public divination as a practice of State ceremony as well as public pagan practices to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 9.16.1-9.16.3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Constantine also issued laws confirming the rights of [[flamens]], priests and [[duumvirs]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 12.1.21, 12.5.2&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he began the practice of using secular power to establish doctrinal orthodoxy within Christianity, an example followed by all later Christian emperors, which led to a circle of Christian violence, and of Christian resistance couched in terms of martyrdom.&lt;ref&gt;There is no crime for those who have Christ; religious violence in the Roman Empire.

==Beginning of persecution of paganism==
{{main|Christian persecution of paganism under Constantius II}}
[[File:Disfigured Augustus Ephesus.jpg|right|thumb|A cult statue of the divinized Augustus, disfigured by a Christian cross carved into the emperor's forehead.]]
The actions of [[Constantius II]], who reigned from 337 till 361, marked the beginning of the era of formal persecution against paganism by the [[Christian Roman Empire]], with the emanation of laws and edicts which punished pagan practices.&lt;ref name="Kirsch04pp200-201"&gt;Kirsch, J. (2004) ''God against the Gods'', pp.200-1, Viking Compass&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CodexTheodosianus16.10.4"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/codex-theod1.html "The Codex Theodosianus On Religion", XVI.x.4, 4 CE]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 350s, new laws prescribed the death penalty for those who performed or attended pagan [[sacrifice]]s, and for the worshipping of idols;&lt;ref name="CodexTheodosianus16.10.6"&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.6&lt;/ref&gt; temples were shut down,&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CodexTheodosianus16.10.4"/&gt; and the traditional [[Altar of Victory]] was removed from the Senate.&lt;ref name="Sheridan66"&gt;Sheridan, J.J. (1966) ''The Altar of Victor – Paganism's Last Battle.'' in L'Antiquite Classique 35 : 186-187.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also frequent episodes of ordinary Christians destroying, pillaging, desecrating, vandalizing many of the ancient pagan temples, tombs and monuments.&lt;ref name="Ammianus22.4.3"&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ''Res Gestae'' 22.4.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sozomen3.18"&gt;[[Sozomen]] ''Ecclesiastical History'' 3.18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CodexTheodosianus16.10.3"&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CodexTheodosianus9.17.2"&gt;Theodosian Code 9.17.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The harsh imperial edicts had to face the vast following of paganism among the population, and the passive resistance of governors and magistrates.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathEncy1914Constantius"&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia (1914) [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16027c.htm ''Flavius Julius Constantius'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ammianus9.10and19.12"&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ''Res Gestae'' 9.10, 19.12. quote summary: Ammianus describes pagan sacrifices and worship taking place openly in [[Alexandria]] and [[Rome]].

(1978) ''The Age of Constantine and Julian''&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-pagan legislation, beginning with Constantius, would in time have an unfavourable influence on the [[Middle Ages]] and, in some ways, become the basis of the [[Inquisition]].&lt;ref name="G.

==Restoration and tolerance from Julian till Valens (361–375)==
{{main|Restoration and tolerance of Paganism from Julian till Valens}}
Under the sole rule of Julian from 361–363, Paganism saw an attempt at restoration; while from 363 till 375, under the reigns of [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]], [[Valens]] and [[Valentinian I]], it received a relative tolerance.

===Julian===
[[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] was a nephew of Constantine and received a Christian training but the murder of his father, brother and two uncles, in the aftermath of Constantine's death, he attributed to Constantius and by association to Christians in general.{{citation needed|date=July 2007}} This antipathy was deepened when Constantius executed Julian's only remaining brother in 354 AD.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;"FLAVIUS CLAUDIUS JULIANUS", Karl Hoeber, Catholic Encyclopedia 1910, retrieved 13 May 2007.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08558b.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; After childhood Julian was educated by [[hellenistic philosophy|hellenists]] and was attracted to the teachings of [[neoplatonists]] and the old religions.

Julian's religious beliefs were [[syncretic]] and he was an initiate of at least three [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]]. But Julian's religious open-mindedness did not extend to Christianity due to its belief that it had an exclusive perspective on religious truth. Seeing itself as the only true religion, Christianity was opposed to, and fundamentally incompatible with, the more inclusive syncretism of paganism.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Brodd 1995" /&gt;

As Emperor, Julian sought to turn the tide in the attempted suppression of non-Christian religions. As his first task he sought to reestablish the old Roman Pagan practice of incorporation of other religions.  But now instead of allowing different cults using different names for the same or similar deities, Julian's training in Christianity and Imperial government influenced him to develop a single pagan religion.  Thus, his ideas concerning the revival and organization of the old religion, shaping it into a coherent body of doctrine, ritual and liturgy&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; with a hierarchy under the supervision of the emperor was the hallmark of his reign.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;  Julian organized elaborate rituals and attempted to set forth a clarified philosophy of [[Neo-Platonism]] that might unite all Pagans.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Res Gestae 22.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian allowed religious freedom and avoided any form of actual compulsion. The Christian [[Sozomen]] acknowledges that Julian did not compel Christians to offer sacrifice nor did he allow the people to commit any act of injustice towards the Christians or insult them.&lt;ref name="Sozomen Ecclesiastical History 5.5"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/26025.htm Sozomen Ecclesiastical History 5.5]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no Christian was allowed to teach or study the ancient classical authors, "Let them keep to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]", thus ending any chance they had of a professional career.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ammianus_25_book25.htm Ammianus Res Gestae 25.4.20]&lt;/ref&gt;

He withdrew the privileges of the Christian clergy, bestowed on them by Constantine, and ordered them to make restitution. Those who had demolished temples during the reign of Constantine and Constantius, were made to rebuild them, or to defray the expenses of their re-erection.  Only pagans were allowed to teach in law, rhetoric, philosophy, or practice any form of state sanctioned religious liturgy.  Julian required those who had abandoned the deities to purify themselves before they were allowed the privilege of taking part in their worship once again. He was devoted to divination and allowed his subjects to freely practice this art.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Res Gestae 25.4&lt;/ref&gt; In general the privileges and immunities given to the Christians were now replaced with those given to pagan philosophers and priests who subscribed to his neo-platonic pagan religion.&lt;ref name="Sozomen Ecclesiastical History 5.5" /&gt;

===Jovian, Valentinian and Valens===
After the death of Julian, [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] seems to have instituted a policy of religious toleration which avoided the relative extremes of Constantius and Julian.&lt;ref&gt;Themistius Oration 5; Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of [[Philostorgius]], 8.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Valentinian I]] and [[Valens]] this period of [[religious toleration]] continued. Pagan writers praise both of these emperors for their liberal religious policies.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Res Gestae 20.9; Themistius Oration 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentinian and Valens granted complete toleration for all cults at the beginning of their reign in 364.&lt;ref name="Theodosian Code 9.16.9"&gt;Theodosian Code 9.16.9&lt;/ref&gt;  Valentinian, who ruled in the west, even allowed the performance of nocturnal sacrifices, which had been previously prohibited due to the attempt of some people to practice unlawful divination under the cover of the night, after the [[proconsul]] of Greece appealed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus 4.3&lt;/ref&gt;  Valentinian also confirmed the rights and privileges of the Pagan priests and confirmed the right of Pagans to be the exclusive caretakers of their temples.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 17.1.60, 17.1.75, 16.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Valens, who was ruling in the east, was an [[Arianism|Arian]] and was too engaged with fighting against the [[Orthodox Christians]] to bother much with the Pagans. In both the west and east severe laws were once again passed prohibiting private divination.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 9.16.7, 9.16.8, 9.16.10, 9.38.3, 9.38.4&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the over zealousness of the populace to stop harmful divination, the haruspices and augurs began to be afraid to show themselves in public. This led the emperors to formally authorize the practice of official and lawful divination by law in 371.&lt;ref name="Theodosian Code 9.16.9" /&gt; Despite the official policy, anti-pagan laws remained in force, and unofficial destruction of pagan holy sites was also tolerated.

==Renewal of persecution under Gratian==
Upon the death of his father ([[Valentinian I]]) in the year 375, [[Gratian]] began his actual reign at the age of sixteen. Six days after the death of Valentinian I, Gratian's half brother, [[Valentinian II]], who was only four years old, was also declared emperor. After the death of [[Valens]], at the battle of [[Adrianople]] in 378, Gratian chose a Spaniard named [[Theodosius I]] to succeed his uncle. Gratian had been educated by [[Ausonius]] who had praised his pupil for his tolerance. Upon the death of his father, Gratian came under the influence of [[Ambrose]], who became his chief advisor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06729c.htm "Gratian", Catholic Encyclopedia, 1909]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Letter of Gratian to Ambrose", The Letters of Ambrose Bishop of Milan, 379AD.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_01_letters01_10.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of Ambrose, active steps to repress Paganism were taken.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 2.8.18-2.8.25, 16.7.1-16.7.5&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Ambrose was a significant force that brought to an end a period of widespread, if unofficial, religious tolerance that had existed since the time of Julian.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus (4.35) indicated that change occurred in Gratian's character when he fell under the influence of evil courtiers.&lt;/ref&gt; Gratian dealt Paganism several blows in 382.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Epistles 17-18; Symmachus Relationes 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this year, Gratian appropriated the income of the Pagan priests and [[Vestal Virgins]], confiscated the personal possessions of the priestly colleges and ordered the removal of the [[Altar of Victory]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, J.J., "The Altar of Victor – Paganism's Last Battle." L'Antiquite Classique 35 (1966): 187.&lt;/ref&gt;  The colleges of Pagan priests also lost all their privileges and immunities. Gratian declared that all of the Pagan temples and shrines were to be confiscated by the government and that their revenues were to be joined to the property of the royal treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.20; Symmachus Relationes 1-3; Ambrose Epistles 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pagan Senators responded by sending an appeal to Gratian, reminding him that he was still the [[Pontifex Maximus]] and that it was his duty to see that the Pagan rites were properly performed. They appealed to Gratian to restore the altar of Victory and the rights and privileges of the Vestal Virgins and priestly colleges. Gratian, at the urging of Ambrose, did not grant an audience to the Pagan Senators. In response to being reminded by the Pagans that he was still the head of the ancestral religion, Gratian renounced the title and office of [[Pontifex Maximus]] under the influence of Ambrose, declaring that it was unsuitable for a Christian to hold this office.

==Under Theodosius I==
{{main|Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I}}
[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|''Saint Ambrose and Emperor Theodosius'', [[Anthony van Dyck]].]]
The Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I began in 381, after the first couple of years his reign in the Eastern Roman Empire. In the 380s, [[Theodosius I]] reiterated Constantius' ban on [[Pagan]] sacrifice, prohibited [[haruspicy]] [[death penalty|on pain of death]], pioneered the criminalization of Magistrates who did not enforce anti-Pagan laws, broke up some pagan associations and destroyed Pagan temples.

Between 389-391 he emanated the "Theodosian decrees," which established a practical ban on paganism;&lt;ref name="TheodosianCode16.10.11"&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.11&lt;/ref&gt; visits to the temples were forbidden,&lt;ref name="Routery1997ch4"&gt;Routery, Michael (1997) [http://www.vinland.org/scamp/grove/kreich/chapter4.html ''The First Missionary War. The Church take over of the Roman Empire'', Ch. 4, ''The Serapeum of Alexandria''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531093733/http://www.vinland.org/scamp/grove/kreich/chapter4.html |date=31 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheodosianCode16.10.10"&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.10&lt;/ref&gt; remaining Pagan [[holidays]] abolished, the [[Sacred fire of Vesta|eternal fire]] in the Temple of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] in the [[Roman Forum]] extinguished, the [[Vestal Virgins]] disbanded, [[auspices]] and [[witchcraft]]ing punished. Theodosius refused to restore the [[Altar of Victory]] in the Senate House, as asked by Pagan [[Roman Senate|Senators]].

In 392 he became emperor of the whole empire (the last one to do so). From this moment till the end of his reign in 395, while Pagans remained outspoken in their demands for toleration,&lt;ref name="Zosimus4.59"&gt;Zosimus 4.59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SymmachusRelatio3"&gt;Symmachus Relatio 3.&lt;/ref&gt; he authorized or participated in the destruction of many temples, holy sites, images and objects of piety throughout the empire,&lt;ref name="Grindle1892pp29-30"&gt;Grindle, Gilbert (1892) ''The Destruction of Paganism in the Roman Empire'', pp.29-30. Quote summary: For example, Theodosius ordered Cynegius (Zosimus 4.37), the praetorian prefect of the East, to permanently close down the temples and forbade the worship of the deities throughout Egypt and the East. Most of the destruction was perpetrated by Christian monks and bishops,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LifeStMartin"&gt;[http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~eknuth/npnf2-11/sulpitiu/lifeofst.html#14 Life of St. Martin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibbonch28"&gt;Gibbon, Edward  ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', ch28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ramsey"&gt;R.

For more information about the question of this date, see Kotynski.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polytheism revival==
Upon the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395, a political crisis ensued, which the barbarians were quick to take advantage of by invading the empire on an unprecedented scale. Since most of the Germanic tribes infiltrating, settling, or invading the Empire were Arian Christian, many nominal Orthodox Christians became less certain of their religion.  Some, in a sense of superstition or ancient Roman pagan patriotism, felt the invasions were the result of abandoning the old ways.  Others believed the success of the Germans was because the Orthodox Church was corrupt. Pagans, in their turn, became more aggressive and began to blame the Christians for the disasters affecting the empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eunapius]] reflects some of the Pagan attitudes of this period in his writings. His attitude, however, represents the most fanatical element of the Pagan reaction.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Symmachi-Nicomachi diptych 2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Ivory diptych of a priestess of Ceres, in classical style, ca. 400: the "idol" was defaced and thrown in a well at [[Abbey of Montier-en-Der|Montier-en-Der]] (later an abbey) where it was found. ([[Musée de Cluny]])]]
Despite the pleas of many pagans for tolerance, [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] and [[Arcadius]] continued the work of their father by enacting even more anti-Pagan laws in an attempt to stop this revival of Paganism. The fact that they had to keep repeating their threats by the enactment of numerous laws against the practice of Paganism indicates that their efforts did not succeed in stamping out the traditional Pagan rites, which continued to be practiced discreetly.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.5.41, 16.5.42, 16.5.51, 16,10.15, 16.10.17, 16.10.19&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early part of the reign of Honorius, [[Stilicho]] was able to exercise unlimited power over the west. Stilicho exercised moderation in his religious policies and enacted laws that were favorable to the Pagans. Consequently, during the time in which Stilicho held power, the Pagans enjoyed a brief respite from persecution.  In 395, Arcadius declared that the solemn days of the pagans were no longer to be included in the number of holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodosian Code]] 2.8.22&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, another law was passed by Arcadius that prohibited anyone from going to a pagan sanctuary or temple or celebrating any kind of pagan sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.13&lt;/ref&gt;  This law seems to have been targeted at those Christians who were converting back to paganism as it specifically mentions "those who are trying to stray from the [[dogma]] of the catholic faith." In 396, the privileges of pagan priests and other clerics were officially revoked.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.14&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, Arcadius ordered that pagan temples standing in the countryside were to be destroyed without disorder or riot.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.16, 15.1.36&lt;/ref&gt;  This law seems to indicate that the number of pagans in the countryside was still too large for the Christians to openly destroy the temples that were located there. As a result, Christians had to be content with destroying the pagan temples that were located in mostly municipal areas where they could easily outnumber the pagan inhabitants. The large number of pagans in the east also seems to have forced Arcadius into allowing the ancient festivals and public games to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 15.6.1, 15.6.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, three laws were enacted in the west in 399, under the influence of Stilicho, which were relatively favorable to pagans. Due to the riots caused by Christians in their attempts to destroy the temples, the first of these laws protected pagan temples from the destruction of Christians who pretended that they had been authorized by the government to destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.15&lt;/ref&gt;  The second of these laws acknowledged the right of the people to continue to participate in the traditional banquets, shows, gatherings and amusements associated with the old pagan religion; it did, however, forbid the public performance of any pagan rites or sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.17&lt;/ref&gt;  The third law forbade the destruction of pagan temples that had been cleared of forbidden things and ordered that they were to be kept in good repair.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.18&lt;/ref&gt;  After the death of Stilicho, Honorius and his party in the state gained control and harsh laws against paganism were once again enacted.  In 408, Honorius enacted a new law which ordered that all statues and altars in the temples were to be removed and that the temple buildings and their income were to be appropriated by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.19&lt;/ref&gt;  This law also forbade the holding of any pagan banquet or celebration in the vicinity of the temples. The execution of this law was placed in the hands of the bishops. Two other laws decreed that buildings belonging to known pagans and heretics were to be appropriated by the churches.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.5.43; Constitutiones Sirmondianae 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arcadius died in 408 and his eight-year-old son, Theodosius, was thereupon proclaimed emperor in the East. In the same year, Honorius enacted a law that prohibited anyone who was not catholic from performing imperial service within the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.5.42&lt;/ref&gt;  Zosimus reports that Honorius was forced to repeal this law after one of his best officers, who happened to be a pagan, resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus 5.46; Theodosian Code 16.5.42.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the beginning of 409, Honorius enacted a law that punished judges and officials who did not enforce the laws against pagans.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.5.46&lt;/ref&gt;  This law even punished men of rank who simply kept silent over any pagan rite performed in their own city or district. The hopes of pagans were revived with the elevation of [[Priscus Attalus]], at Rome, in 409. [[Alaric I|Alaric]], an Arian Christian, soon tired of his puppet, however, and Attalus was deposed in the summer of 410 when Honorius promised to negotiate a peace treaty. When these negotiations failed, Alaric took and sacked the city of Rome. This catastrophe shocked the entire Roman world. Both Christians and pagans quickly began to blame each other for something that had hitherto been thought impossible. In this heated atmosphere, Honorius once again reiterated his anti-pagan legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.5.51&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous fragments extant of several Pagan historical works, such as the works of [[Eunapius]] and [[Olympiodorus of Thebes|Olympiodorus]], which indicate that pagans were now openly voicing their resentment in writing. Even after the sack of Rome, in 410, pagans believed that the recent decline of Rome had been caused by the neglect of the ancestral traditions.

In 415, Honorius enacted yet another law that appropriated the Pagan temples throughout the Roman Empire to the government and ordered that all objects that had been consecrated for Pagan sacrifices were to be removed from public places.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.20&lt;/ref&gt;
A prominent example of the anti-pagan climate at the time is the case of the philosopher [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], killed by a mob in 415.

In 416, [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] and [[Theodosius II]] ordered that pagans would no longer be admitted to imperial service nor would they be allowed to receive the rank of administrator or judge.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.21&lt;/ref&gt;  In 423, Theodosius II reiterated the previous laws against Pagans and declared that all Pagans who were caught performing the ancient rites would now have all their goods confiscated and be exiled.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.22, 16.10.23, 16.8.26.&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 423, Honorius died and power was seized in the west by John, who had held the office of [[Primicerius Notariorum]]. John appears to have ushered in a period of [[religious toleration]]. John seems to have attempted to curb the power of ecclesiastics and the privileges of the church in an attempt to treat all people equally.&lt;ref&gt;A law in the Theodosian Code (16.2.47) refers to a [[tyrant]] who issued edicts in opposition to the church. This tyrant (i.e. usurper) is most likely to be identified with John the Primicerius.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 423, Theodosius II published a law that demanded that Christians (whether they were really such or pretended to be so) were not to disturb Pagans who were living peaceably and doing nothing contrary to the law.&lt;ref&gt;This law (Theodosian Code 16.10.24) is interesting because it officially recognizes the fact that there were many people who only pretended to be Christian.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 425, Theodosius II sent an expedition to the west to depose John and establish Valentinian III as emperor of the west. After John was captured and executed, [[Valentinian III]] was proclaimed emperor in the city of Rome. While in the west, Theodosius II enacted two anti-pagan laws in 425. The first of these stipulated that all pagan superstition was to be rooted out.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.5.63&lt;/ref&gt;  The second law barred pagans from pleading a case in court and also disqualified them from serving as soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutiones Sirmondianae 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Theodosius then left Valentinian to rule the west and returned to Constantinople.

The numerous laws against apostasy that had been continuously promulgated since the time of Gratian and Theodosius are evidence that the emperors were having a hard time even keeping Christians from going astray.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.7.1, 16.7.2, 16.7.3, 16.7.4, 16.7.5, 16.7.6; Justinian Code 1.7.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 426, Theodosius passed yet another law against Christian [[apostates]], who converted to paganism, and those who pretended to become Christian but in reality continued to perform pagan sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.7.7&lt;/ref&gt;  All this legislation proved so ineffective that Theodosius II found it necessary to reiterate his prohibition against pagan rites and sacrifices in 435, this time increasing the penalty to death.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.25. Theodosius II married [[Aelia Eudocia|Eudocia]], the daughter of a Pagan [[sophist]] named [[Leontius]], who herself patronized various Pagans including [[Cyrus of Panopolis]] and the poet [[Nonnus]].&lt;/ref&gt;  This law also ordered that all pagan shrines, temples and sanctuaries that still existed were to be destroyed by the magistrates. Magistrates who failed to carry out this order were ordered to be punished with death. Even the threat of death, however, failed to eradicate paganism as we find Theodosius legislating again, in 438, against Paganism and forbidding Pagan sacrifice once more.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Corpus Legum Novellarum Theodosii 2.3&lt;/ref&gt;  Theodosius threatens those who fail to comply with death and the confiscation of their property. In this law, as the Emperor explicitly admits that Pagan sacrifices were still being openly celebrated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hence our clemency perceives the need of keeping watch over the pagans and their heathen enormities, since by natural depravity and stubborn lawlessness, they forsake the path of true religion. They disdain in any way to perform the nefarious rites of sacrifice and the false errors of their baleful superstition by some means or other in the hidden solitudes, unless their crimes are made public by the profession of their crimes to insult divine majesty and to show scorn to our age. Not the thousand terrors of laws already promulgated nor the penalty of exile pronounced upon them deter these men, whereby, if they cannot reform, at least they might learn to abstain from their mass of their crimes and the multitude of their sacrifices. But their insane audacity transgresses continually; our patience is exhausted by their wicked behavior so that if we desired to forget them, we could not disregard them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Final decline==
The continued vitality of paganism led [[Marcian]], who became emperor of the east in 450 upon the death of Theodosius II, to repeat earlier prohibitions against pagan rites. Marcian decreed, in the year 451, that those who continued to perform the pagan rites would suffer the confiscation of their property and be condemned to death. Marcian also prohibited any attempt to re-open the temples and ordered that they were to remain closed. In addition to this, in order to encourage strict enforcement of the law a fine of fifty pounds of gold was imposed on any judge or governor, as well as the officials under him, who did not enforce this law.&lt;ref&gt;Justinian Code 1.11.7&lt;/ref&gt;  However, not even this had the desired effect, as we find Leo I, who succeeded Marcian in 457, publishing a new law in 472 which imposed severe penalties for the owner of any property who was aware that Pagan rites were performed on his property. If the property owner was of high rank he was punished by the loss of his rank or office and by the confiscation of his property. If the property owner was of lower status he would be physically tortured and then condemned to labor in the mines for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Justinian Code 1.11.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more laws against paganism, which may be from this period, are preserved in the [[Justinian Code]].&lt;ref&gt;These laws (Justinian Code 1.11.9, 1.11.10) do not give any date nor do they mention the emperors who promulgated them.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the deposition of [[Avitus]], who ruled as emperor of the West from 455 to 456, there seems to have been a conspiracy among the Roman nobles to place the pagan general [[Marcellinus (magister militum)|Marcellinus]] on the throne to restore Paganism; but it came to nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Sidonius Epistle 1.11.6&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 457, Leo I became the first emperor to be crowned by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]. [[Anthemius]] (467-472), one of the last Western Roman emperors, seems to have planned a pagan revival at Rome.&lt;ref name="Photius Bibliotheca cod. 242"&gt;Photius Bibliotheca cod. 242&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a descendant of [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]], the relative of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]. Anthemius gave [[Messius Phoebus Severus]], a pagan philosopher who was a close friend of his, the important offices of [[Praefectus urbi]] of Rome, [[Consul]] and [[Patrikios|Patrician]]. Anthemius placed the image of [[Hercules]], in the act of vanquishing the [[Nemean lion]], on his coins. The murder of Anthemius (by [[Ricimer]]) destroyed the hopes of those pagans who believed that the traditional rites would now be restored.&lt;ref&gt;Marcellinus Chronicle s.a. 468&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly thereafter, in 476, the western emperor was deposed by [[Odoacer]], who became the first barbarian king of Italy. In spite of this disaster, pagans made one last attempt to revive the pagan rites. In 484, the [[Magister militum per Orientem]], [[Illus]], revolted against [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and raised his own candidate, [[Leontius (usurper)|Leontius]], to the throne. Leontius hoped to reopen the temples and restore the ancient ceremonies and because of this many pagans joined in his revolt against Zeno.&lt;ref name="Photius Bibliotheca cod. 242" /&gt;  Illus and Leontius were compelled, however, to flee to a remote [[Isauria]]n fortress, where Zeno besieged them for four years. Zeno finally captured them in 488 and promptly had them executed.&lt;ref&gt;Theophanes Chronographia s.a. A.M. 5976-5980; John Malalas Chronicle 15.12-15.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the revolt, Zeno instituted a harsh persecution of pagan intellectuals. With the failure of the revolt of Leontius, some pagans became disillusioned and many became Christian, or simply pretended to, in order to avoid persecution.&lt;ref&gt;There continued to be a sufficient number of pagans during the reign of Justinian for a law to be published, in 527 (Justinian Code 1.5.12), which barred pagans from office and confiscated their property.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christianization]] of the Roman Empire became complete when the emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus]], who came to the throne in 491, was forced to sign a written declaration of orthodoxy before his coronation.

==Timeline==
*313 By the [[Edict of Milan]], Constantine and Licinius establish toleration of Christianity.
*329–335 Constantine orders destruction of Hellenic temples at [[Didyma]], Mt. Athos,  Aigeai, [[Baalbek]] etc. According to pagan rhetor Libanius (Address to Theodosius, Pro Templis, 6 and 37), Constantine I "did not bring any change to the traditional [=pagan] worship... one could notice that [during the reign of Constantine] all rituals were performed properly" and  "he [Constantine] did not prohibit [pagan] sacrifices". According to Zosimus (book 2 of his "History"), Constantine erected two pagan temples in his capital, Constantinople.
*361–363 Emperor [[Flavius Claudius Julianus|Julian]], the last pagan Emperor, proclaims restoration of Hellenic worship.
*389–391 [[Theodosian decrees]], Christianity becomes official state religion of the [[Roman Empire]].
*440-450 All Hellenic monuments, altars and Temples of [[Athens]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], and other Greek cities are destroyed. As German historian Gregorovius, in his "History of Athens" says, the pagan monuments of Athens and Greece were the best preserved among other monuments in the late Roman Empire.
*410-529 Despite the Platonic Academy being destroyed in the first century BC by [[Sulla]], it was not until the early 5th century (c. 410) that a revived academy (which had no connection with the original Academy) was established by some leading [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron, "The last days of the Academy at Athens," in ''Proceedings of the Cambridge Philological Society'' vol 195 (n.s. 15), 1969, pp 7–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 529 the [[Byzantine Empire|emperor]] [[Justinian I|Justinian]] ended the funding of the revived Neoplatonic Academy because of active paganism of its professors. Other schools continued in Constantinople, Antioch and Alexandria which were the centers of Justinian's empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David C. "The Beginnings of Western Science", page 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BritA&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Higher Education in the Byzantine Empire, 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians such as Blumental&lt;ref&gt;"529 and its Sequell: What happened to the Academy?"

The '''Desert Fathers''' (along with [[Desert Mothers]]) were early Christian [[hermit]]s, [[ascetics]], and [[monk]]s who lived mainly in the [[Scetes]] desert of Egypt beginning around the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|third century AD]]. The ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' is a collection of the wisdom of some of the early desert monks and nuns, in print as ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers''. The most well known was [[Anthony the Great]], who moved to the desert in AD&amp;nbsp;270–271 and became known as both the father and founder of desert monasticism. By the time Anthony died in AD&amp;nbsp;356, thousands of monks and nuns had been drawn to living in the desert following Anthony's example—his biographer, [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], wrote that "the desert had become a city."{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}} The Desert Fathers had a major influence on the development of Christianity.

The desert monastic communities that grew out of the informal gathering of hermit monks became the model for [[Christian monasticism]]. The eastern monastic tradition at [[Mount Athos]] and the western [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] both were strongly influenced by the traditions that began in the desert. All of the monastic revivals of the Middle Ages looked to the desert for inspiration and guidance. Much of [[Eastern Christian]] spirituality, including the [[Hesychast]] movement, had its roots in the practices of the Desert Fathers. Even religious renewals such as the German evangelicals and [[Pietists]] in Pennsylvania, the ''[[Devotio Moderna]]'' movement, and the [[Methodist Revival]] in England are seen by modern scholars as being influenced by the Desert Fathers.{{sfn|Burton-Christie|1993|pp=7–9}}

==Early history==
[[File:St Macarius the Great with Cherub.jpg|thumb|"Saint [[Macarius of Egypt|Macarius]] and a Cherub" from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], Sinai, Egypt]]
[[Paul of Thebes]] is often credited with being the first hermit monk to go to the desert, but it was [[Anthony the Great]] who launched the movement that became the Desert Fathers.{{sfn|Waddell|1957|p=30}} Sometime around AD&amp;nbsp;270, Anthony heard a Sunday sermon stating that perfection could be achieved by selling all of one's possessions, giving the proceeds to the poor, and following Christ (Matt. 19:21). He followed the advice and made the further step of moving deep into the desert to seek complete solitude.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}}

Anthony lived in a time of transition for Christianity—the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] in AD&amp;nbsp;303 was the last great formal persecution of Christians in the [[Roman Empire]]. Only ten years later, [[Christianity]] was made legal in Egypt by [[Diocletian]]'s successor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]]. Those who left for the desert formed an alternate Christian society, at a time when it was no longer a risk to be a Christian. The solitude, austerity, and sacrifice of the desert was seen by Anthony as an alternative to martyrdom, which was formerly seen by many Christians as the highest form of sacrifice.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=16}} Anthony quickly gained followers eager to live their lives in accordance with this solidarity and separation from material goods. From these prohibitions it is recorded by Athanasius that Anthony received special privileges from God, such as the ability to heal the sick, inspire others to have faith in healing through God, and even converse with God on occasion.{{sfn|Athanasius|1892}} Around this time, desert monasticism appeared nearly simultaneously in several areas, including Egypt and Syria.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}}

Over time, the model of Anthony and other hermits attracted many followers, who lived alone in the desert or in small groups. They chose a life of extreme [[asceticism]], renouncing all the pleasures of the senses, rich food, baths, rest, and anything that made them comfortable.{{sfn|Riddle|2008|p=43}} They instead focused their energies on praying, singing psalms, fasting, giving alms to the needy, and preserving love and harmony with one another while keeping their thoughts and desires for God alone.{{sfn|Athanasius|1892}} Thousands joined them in the desert, mostly men but also a handful of women. Religious seekers also began going to the desert seeking advice and counsel from the early Desert Fathers. By the time of Anthony's death, there were so many men and women living in the desert that it was described as "a city" by Anthony's biographer.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}}

The Desert Fathers advocated three main approaches to monasticism. One was the austere life of the hermit, as practiced by Anthony and his followers in lower Egypt. Another was the [[Cenobite|cenobitic]] life, communities of monks and nuns in upper Egypt formed by [[Pachomius]]. The third was a semi-hermitic lifestyle seen mostly in [[Nitria (monastic site)|Nitria]], [[Kellia]] and [[Scetis]], west of the Nile, begun by [[Saint Amun]]. The latter were small groups (two to six) of monks and nuns with a common spiritual elder—these separate groups would join together in larger gatherings to worship on Saturdays and Sundays. This third form of monasticism was responsible for most of the sayings that were compiled as the ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' (''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'').{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}}

==Development of monastic communities==
[[File:StPakhom.jpg|thumb|Icon of [[Pachomius]]]]
The small communities founded by the Desert Fathers were the beginning of [[Christian monasticism]]. Initially Anthony and others lived as hermits, sometimes forming groups of two or three. Small informal communities began developing, until the monk [[Pachomius]], seeing the need for a more formal structure, established a monastery with rules and organization. His regulations included discipline, obedience, manual labour, silence, fasting, and long periods of prayer—some historians view the rules as being inspired by Pachomius' experiences as a Roman soldier.{{sfn|Riddle|2008|p=43}}

The first fully organized monastery under Pachomius included men and women living in separate quarters, up to three in a room. They supported themselves by weaving cloth and baskets, along with other tasks. Each new monk or nun had a three-year probationary period, concluding with admittance in full standing to the monastery. All property was held communally, meals were eaten together and in silence, twice a week they fasted, and they wore simple peasant clothing with a hood. Several times a day they came together for prayer and readings, and each person was expected to spend time alone meditating on the scriptures. Programs were created for educating those who came to the monastery unable to read.{{sfn|Irvin|Sundquist|2001|pp=210–212}}

Pachomius also formalized the establishment of an ''abba'' (father) or ''amma'' (mother) in charge of the spiritual welfare of their monks and nuns, with the implication that those joining the monastery were also joining a new family. Members also formed smaller groups, with different tasks in the community and the responsibility of looking after each other's welfare. The new approach grew to the point that there were tens of thousands of monks and nuns in these organized communities within decades of Pachomius' death.{{sfn|Irvin|Sundquist|2001|pp=210–212}} One of the early pilgrims to the desert was [[Basil of Caesarea]], who took the Rule of Pachomius into the eastern church. Basil expanded the idea of community by integrating the monks and nuns into the wider public community, with the monks and nuns under the authority of a bishop and serving the poor and needy.{{sfn|Irvin|Sundquist|2001|pp=210–212}}

As more pilgrims began visiting the monks in the desert, influence from the monastic communities began spreading. Latin versions of the original Greek stories and sayings of the Desert Fathers, along with the earliest monastic rules coming out of the desert, guided the early monastic development in the Byzantine world and eventually in the western Christian world.{{sfn|Wilfong|1998|p=193}} [[John Cassian]] played an important role in mediating the influence of the Desert Fathers to the West.{{sfn|Gregory|Kazhdan|1991|pp=387–388}} This can be seen, for example, in the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], where [[Benedict of Nursia]] urged his monks to read the writings of [[John Cassian]] on the Desert Fathers. The ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'' was also widely read in the early Benedictine monasteries.{{sfn|Burton-Christie|1993|p=6}}

==Notable Desert Fathers and Mothers==
[[File:Arsenius the Great.jpg|thumb|Icon of [[Arsenius the Great]], notable Desert Father]]
Many of the monks and nuns developed a reputation for holiness and wisdom, with the small communities following a particularly holy or wise elder, who was their spiritual father (''[[Abbot|abba]]'') or mother (''amma''). The individual Desert Fathers and [[Desert Mothers]] are mostly known through ''The Sayings of the Desert Fathers'', which included 1,202 sayings attributed to twenty-seven ''abbas'' and three ''ammas''.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=4}} The greatest number of sayings are attributed to Abba "Poemen", Greek for "shepherd". Because of the wide disparity of dates for the sayings attributed to Abba Poemen, some scholars believe that "Poemen" was a generic name for a combination of different unnamed Abbas.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=6}} Others conclude that the sayings attributed to Abba Poemen are accurate, based on a notable and historical Abba Poemen.{{sfn|Harmless|2000}} Among the notable Desert Fathers and Mothers with sayings in the book, in addition to [[Anthony the Great]], were [[Arsenius the Great]], [[Poemen]], [[Macarius of Egypt]], [[Moses the Black]], and [[Syncletica of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|pp=19–29}}

Other notable Desert Fathers include [[Pachomius]] and [[Shenouda the Archimandrite]], and many individuals who spent part of their lives in the Egyptian desert, including [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], [[John Chrysostom]], [[Evagrius Ponticus]], [[Hilarion]] and [[John Cassian]]. Cassian's works brought the wisdom of the Desert Fathers into a wider arena.

==Practices==
{{Christian mysticism}}

===Withdrawal from society===
The legalization of Christianity by the Roman Empire in 313 gave Anthony a greater resolve to go out into the desert. Nostalgic for the tradition of martyrdom, he saw withdrawal and asceticism as an alternative. He insisted on selling all his material possessions—he left his younger sister a small amount of money to live her life in a convent, and donated the rest to the poor.{{sfn|Athanasius|1892}} When members of the church began finding ways to work with the Roman state, the Desert Fathers saw that as a compromise between "the things of God and the things of Caesar." The monastic communities were essentially an alternate Christian society.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=16}} The hermits doubted that religion and politics could ever produce a truly Christian society. For them, the only Christian society was spiritual and not mundane.{{sfn|Merton|1960|p=4}}

===Hesychasm===
''[[Hesychasm]]'' (from the Greek for "stillness, rest, quiet, silence"){{sfn|Parry|Melling|Brady|Griffith|1999|p=91}} is a mystical tradition and movement that originated with the Desert Fathers and was central to their practice of prayer.{{sfnm |1a1=Binns |1y=2006 |1p=588 |2a1=Meyendorff |2y=1974 |2p=1 |3a1=Ward |3y=1984 |3p=250}} ''Hesychasm'' for the Desert Fathers was primarily the practice of "interior silence and continual prayer." It did not become a formal movement of specific practices until the fourteenth century Byzantine meditative prayer techniques, when it was more closely identified with the [[Prayer of the Heart]], or "Jesus Prayer".{{sfnm |1a1=Nes |1y=2007 |1p=97&lt;!-- "The spirituality of Hesychasm can be traced back to the Desert Fathers, but the method itself was presented in a more systematic form at the turn of the thirteenth century." --&gt; |2a1=Rock |2y=2006 |2p=262&lt;!-- "...'hesychasm' primarily describes the monastic practice of interior silence and continual prayer first established by the Desert Fathers and was not used to indicate a distinct spiritual movement until the fourteenth century Byzantine revival of meditative prayer techniques."--&gt;}} That prayer's origin is also traced back to the Desert Fathers—the Prayer of the Heart was found inscribed in the ruins of a cell from that period in the Egyptian desert.{{sfn|Guillaumont|1979}} The earliest written reference to the practice of the Prayer of the Heart may be in a discourse collected in the ''[[Philokalia]]'' on Abba Philimon, a Desert Father.{{sfn|McGinn|2006|p=125}} ''Hesychast'' prayer was a meditative practice that was traditionally done in silence and with eyes closed—"empty of mental pictures" and visual concepts, but with the intense consciousness of God's presence.{{sfn|Ware|2000|p=101}}

The words ''hesychast'' and ''hesychia'' were frequently used in 4th and 5th century writings of Desert Fathers such as [[Macarius of Egypt]], [[Evagrius Ponticus]], and [[Gregory of Nyssa]].{{sfn|Peterson|2008|p=304}} The title ''hesychast'' was used in early times synonymously with ''hermit'', as compared to a [[cenobite]] who lived in community.{{sfn|Nes|2007|p=97}} ''Hesychasm'' can refer to inner or outer stillness, though in ''The Sayings of the Desert Fathers'' it referred to inner tranquility.{{sfn|Egan|1996|p=71}}

===Charity and forgiveness===
The Desert Fathers gave a great deal of emphasis to living and practicing the teachings of Christ, much more than theoretical knowledge. Their efforts to live the commandments were not seen as being easy—many of the stories from that time recount the struggle to overcome negative emotions such as anger and judgment of others. Helping a brother monk who was ill or struggling was seen as taking priority over any other consideration. Hermits were frequently seen to break a long fast when hosting visitors, as hospitality and kindness were more important than keeping the ascetic practices that were so dominant in the Desert Fathers' lives.{{sfn|Burton-Christie|1993|pp=161–163}}

===Recitation of scripture===
The lives of the Desert Fathers that were organized into communities included frequent recitation of the scriptures—during the week they chanted psalms while performing manual labour and during the weekends they held liturgies and group services. The monk's experience in the cell occurred in a variety of ways, including meditation on scripture.{{sfnm |1a1=Harmless |1y=2004 |1p=244 |2a1=Keller |2y=2005 |2p=55}} Group practices were more prominent in the organized communities formed by Pachomius.{{sfn|Irvin|Sundquist|2001|pp=210–212}} The purpose of these practices were explained by [[John Cassian]], a Desert Father, who described the goal of psalmody (the outward recitation of scripture) and asceticism as the ascent to  deep mystical prayer and mystical contemplation.{{sfn|Egan|1996|p=71}}

==Excerpts from ''The Sayings of the Desert Fathers''==
*"A hermit said, 'Take care to be silent. Empty your mind. Attend to your meditation in the fear of God, whether you are resting or at work. If you do this, you will not fear the attacks of the demons."
*Abba Moses, "Sit in thy cell and thy cell will teach thee all."
*"Somebody asked Anthony, 'What shall I do in order to please God?' He replied, 'Do what I tell you, which is this: wherever you go, keep God in mind; whatever you do, follow the example of Holy Scripture; wherever you are, stay there and do not move away in a hurry. If you keep to these guide-lines, you will be saved.'"
*"He (Evagrius) also said, 'A monk was told that his father had died. He said to the messenger, 'Do not blaspheme. My Father cannot die.'"
*Abbot Pastor, "If someone does evil to you, you should do good to him, so that by your good work you may drive out his malice."
*An Elder, "A man who keeps death before his eyes will at all times overcome his cowardliness."
*Blessed Macarius said, "This is the truth, if a monk regards contempt as praise, poverty as riches, and hunger as a feast, he will never die."
*"It happened that as Abba Arsenius was sitting in his cell that he was harassed by demons. His servants, on their return, stood outside his cell and heard him praying to God in these words, 'O God, do not leave me. I have done nothing good in your sight, but according to your goodness, let me now make a beginning of good.'"
* When one desert father told another of his plans to “ shut himself into his cell and refuse the face of men, that he might perfect himself,” the second monk replied, “ Unless thou first amend thy life going to and fro amongst men, thou shall not avail to amend it dwelling alone.”
*"[[Anthony the Great|Abba Anthony]] said, 'Whoever hammers a lump of iron, first decides what he is going to make of it, a scythe, a sword, or an axe. Even so we ought to make up our minds what kind of virtue we want to forge or we labour in vain.'
*He also said, 'Obedience with abstinence gives men power over wild beasts.'"{{sfn|Ward|1984|p=8}}
*It  was  said  of  [[John the Dwarf|Abba  John  the  Dwarf]],  that  one  day  he  said  to his  elder  brother,  'I  should  like  to  be  free  of  all  care,  like  the  angels, who  do  not  work,  but  ceaselessly  offer  worship  to  God.'  So  he  took off  his  cloak  and  went  away  into  the  desert.  After  a  week  he  came back  to  his  brother.  When  he  knocked  on  the  door,  he  heard  his brother  say,  before  he  opened  it  'Who  are  you?'  He  said,  'I  am  John, your  brother.'  But  he  replied,  'John  has  become  an  angel,  and  henceforth  he  is  no  longer  among  men.'  Then  the  other  begged  him saying,  'It  is  I.'  However,  his  brother  did  not  let  him  in,  but  left  him there  in  distress  until  morning.  Then,  opening  the  door,  he  said  to him,  'You  are  a  man  and  you  must  once  again  work  in  order  to  eat.' Then  John  made  a  prostration  before  him,  saying,  'Forgive  me.'"{{sfn|Ward|1984|p=86}}

==Essential texts==
There are many different collections of sayings of the Desert Fathers. The earliest writings were simply ordered by the initial letter of the Abba's name in the order of the Greek alphabet. So the editors started with Anthony the Great, Arsenius and Agathon and concluded with Cheremon, Psenthaisius and Or. It was those first editors who used the word ''apophthegms'' (meaning: saying, maxim or aphorism)—this is why this collection is now known as''[Apophthegmata Patrum Alphabetica'' (The Sayings of the Desert Fathers: The Alphabetic Collection). This collection contains about a thousand items.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The same editors knew there were also a lot of anonymous sayings and tales of the Desert Fathers and Mothers circulating. This material was gathered into a collection now known as ''[Anonymous Patrum Apophthegmata'' (Anonymous Sayings of the Desert Fathers). These sayings were placed in order of more or less similar subjects (for instance: humility, charity etc.). This collection contains about eight hundred items.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The collection now known as the Systematic Collection began to emerge a century later (AD&amp;nbsp;500). It has sayings from the Alphabetic Collection and the Anonymous Sayings, combined and systematically ordered under twenty-one chapters. This collection contains about 1200 items and therefore does not completely combine the two older collections.{{sfn|Wortley|2012|pp=xvi–xviii}}

A '''Dhvaja sthambham''', '''kodi maram''' or '''kodi-k-kambam''' is a [[Flag#Flagpoles|flagstaff]] that usually features [[South India]]n [[Hindu temple]]s. 

Two other objects that are grouped together with this flagstaff, are the ''bali peetam'' (altar for offerings) and the vehicle ([[vahana]]) of the deity to which the temple is dedicated. Symbolically, these three objects are obstacles that protect the sanctuary of the temple from the impure and undevoted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel|Hiltebeitel, Alf]] (1991).

'''Ernest Christopher Dowson''' (2 August 1867{{spaced ndash}}23 February 1900) was an English poet, novelist,
short-story writer, often associated with the [[Decadent movement]].

==Biography==
Ernest Dowson was born in [[Lee, London]], in 1867. His great-uncle was [[Alfred Domett]], a poet and politician who became [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Premier of New Zealand]] and had allegedly been the subject of [[Robert Browning]]'s poem "Waring." Dowson attended [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], but left in March 1888 without obtaining a degree.{{sfn|Jad|2000|p=17}}

In November 1888, he started work with his father at Dowson and Son, a [[dry-docking]] business in [[Limehouse]], east London, which had been established by the poet's grandfather. He led an active social life, carousing with medical students and law pupils, going to [[music halls]] and taking the performers to dinner. He was also working assiduously at his writing during this time. He was a member of the [[Rhymers' Club]], which included [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Lionel Johnson]]. He was a contributor to such [[literary magazine]]s as ''[[The Yellow Book]]'' and ''[[The Savoy (periodical)|The Savoy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowson collaborated on two unsuccessful novels with [[Arthur Collins Moore|Arthur Moore]], worked on a novel of his own, ''Madame de Viole'', and wrote reviews for ''[[The Critic]]''. Later in his career, Dowson was a prolific translator of French fiction, including novels by [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]] and the [[Goncourt brothers]], and ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos|Choderlos de Laclos]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, aged 23, Dowson became infatuated with the 11 year old Adelaide "Missie" Foltinowicz, daughter of a [[Poland|Polish]] restaurant owner; in 1893 he unsuccessfully proposed to her.&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1968), pp. 61-2.&lt;/ref&gt; To Dowson's despair, Adelaide was eventually to marry a tailor.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1894, Dowson's father, who was in the advanced stages of [[tuberculosis]], died of an overdose of [[chloral hydrate]]. His mother, who was also [[wikt:consumptive|consumptive]], hanged herself in February 1895. Soon after her death, Dowson began to decline rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1968), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
The publisher [[Leonard Smithers]] gave him an allowance to live in France and write translations,&lt;ref&gt;Richards, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; but he returned to London in 1897 (where he stayed with the Foltinowicz family, despite the transfer of Adelaide's affections).&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1968), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1899, [[Robert Sherard]] found Dowson almost penniless in a wine bar and took him back to the cottage in [[Catford]], where Sherard was living. Dowson spent the last six weeks of his life at Sherard's cottage where he died at age 32. He had become a Catholic in 1892 and was interred in the [[Roman Catholic]] section of nearby [[Brockley and Ladywell Cemeteries]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; After Dowson's death, [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote: "Poor wounded wonderful fellow that he was, a tragic reproduction of all tragic poetry, like a symbol, or a scene. I hope bay leaves will be laid on his tomb and rue and myrtle too for he knew what love was".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3FygQsGAzY8C&amp;pg=PA421 Ernest Christopher Dowson, ed., ''The Letters of Ernest Dowson'', Epilogue, p. 421]; Retrieved 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde himself was dead before the end of the year.

==Works==

Dowson is best remembered for such vivid phrases as "Days of Wine and Roses":
{{Quote box
 |quote  = They are not long, the days of wine and roses:&lt;br/&gt;Out of a misty dream&lt;br/&gt;Our path emerges for a while, then closes&lt;br/&gt;Within a dream.
 |source = – Ernest Dowson, from "Vitae Summa Brevis" (1896).
 |align  = left}}
{{Clear}}

and "Gone with the wind":
{{Quote box
 |quote  = I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,&lt;br/&gt;Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng,&lt;br/&gt;Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;&lt;br/&gt;But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,&lt;br/&gt;Yea, all the time, because the dance was long:&lt;br/&gt;I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.
 |source = – Ernest Dowson, from ''Non Sum Qualis eram Bonae Sub Regno Cynarae'',{{efn|name=Horace Odes Book IV,1}} third stanza (1894).
 |align  = left
}}{{Clear}}

This latter poem was first published in ''The Second Book of the Rhymer's Club'' in 1894,{{sfn|Mathews|Lane|1894|pp=60–61}} and was noticed by [[Richard Le Gallienne]] in his "Wanderings in Bookland" column in ''[[The Idler (1892–1911)|The Idler]]'', volume 9.{{sfn|The Idler Volume 9|p=889}} This is also the source of the phrase 'I have been faithful..in my fashion'.

[[Margaret Mitchell]], touched by the "far away, faintly sad sound I wanted" of the third stanza's first line, chose that line as the title of her novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.awesomestories.com/asset/view/SOURCE-of-the-TITLE-GWTW-Margaret-Mitchell-Gone-with-the-Wind&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Dowson provides the earliest use of the word [[soccer]] in written language (although he spells it ''socca'', presumably because it did not yet have a standard written form).{{efn|name=n2}}

His prose works include the short stories collected as ''Dilemmas'' (1895), and the two novels ''A Comedy of Masks'' (1893) and ''Adrian Rome'' (each co-written with [[Arthur Collins Moore|Arthur Moore]]).

===Books===
* ''A comedy of masks : a novel'' (1893) With Arthur Moore.
* ''Dilemmas, stories and studies in sentiment'' (1895)
* ''Verses'' (1896)
* ''The Pierrot of the minute : a dramatic phantasy in one act'' (1897)
* ''Decorations in Verse and Prose'' (1899)
* ''Adrian Rome'' (1899) With Arthur Moore.
* ''Cynara : a little book of verse'' (1907)
* ''Studies in sentiment'' (1915)
* ''The Poems and Prose of Ernest Dowson, With a Memoir by Arthur Symons'' (1919)
* ''Letters of Ernest Dowson'' (1968)
* ''Collected shorter fiction'' (2003)

==Legacy==

His collaborator Arthur Moore wrote several witty comic novels about the young adult duo of Anthony 'Tony' Wilder and Paul Morrow (one, 'The Eyes of Light' is mentioned by friend [[E. Nesbit]] in her book '[[The Phoenix and the Carpet]]'). Tony is based on Dowson, while Paul is based on Moore.

[[Frederick Delius]] set a number of Dowson's poems, in his ''[[Songs of Sunset]]'' and ''[[Cynara (Delius)|Cynara]]''.

[[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] included a setting of "I Was Not Sorrowful (Spleen)" from ''Verses'' (1896) in his 1912 [[song cycle]] ''[[Songs of a Wayfarer]]''.

[[T. E. Lawrence]] quotes from Dowson's poem, "Impenitentia Ultima," in ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'', chapter LIV.

In anticipation of the anniversary of Dowson's birth on 2 August 2010, his grave, which had fallen derelict and been vandalized, was restored. The unveiling and memorial service were publicised in the local (''[[South London Press]]'') and national ([[BBC Radio 4]] and the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'') British press, and dozens paid posthumous tribute to the poet 110 years after his death. In the Poems and Prose of Ernest Dowson, a 1919 memoir written by [[Arthur Symons]], Symons described Dowson as, "... a man who was undoubtedly a man of genius ... There never was a poet to whom verse came more naturally ... He had the pure lyric gift, unweighed or unballasted by any other quality of mind or emotion..."{{sfn|Dowson|2007|loc=Memoir from 1990 edition}}

'''Father Divine''' ([[circa|c]]. 1876{{spaced ndash}}September 10, 1965), also known as '''Reverend M. J. Divine''', was an [[African American]] [[spirituality|spiritual]] leader&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Gordon Melton |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166561/Father-Divine |title=Father Divine (American religious leader) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1965-09-10 |accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; from about 1907 until his death. His full self-given name was '''Reverend Major Jealous Divine''', and he was also known as "the Messenger" early in his life. He founded the [[International Peace Mission movement]], formulated [[Doctrine of Father Divine|its doctrine]], and oversaw its growth from a small and predominantly black congregation into a multiracial and international church.

Father Divine claimed to be [[God]].&lt;ref name="life19361207" /&gt; He made numerous contributions toward his followers' economic independence and [[racial equality]]. He was a contemporary of other religious leaders such as [[Daddy Grace]], [[Charles Harrison Mason]], [[Noble Drew Ali]] and [[James F. Jones (minister)|James F. Jones]] (also known as Prophet Jones).

==Life and career==

===Prior to 1912: Early life and original name===
Little is known about Father Divine's early life, or even his real given name. Father Divine and the Peace Movement he started did not keep many records. Father Divine himself declined several offers to write his [[biography]], saying that the history of God would not be useful in mortal terms. He also refused to acknowledge relationship to any family. Newspapers in the 1930s had to dig up his probable given name: George Baker. (This name is not recognized by the [[Library of Congress]], and from 1979, there is no further use of that name as a heading for Father Divine in libraries' catalogs.)&lt;ref&gt;* ''Copy of the letter from the Library of Congress about the catalog heading for Father Divine [http://peacemission.info/sermons/copy-of-letter-from-the-library-of-congress-about-its-catalog-heading-for-father-divine/ Copy of the letter]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] files record his name as George Baker alias "God".&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Jill. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hRKCcyndVvkC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=%22george+baker+alias+god%22 ''God, Harlem U.S.A: The Father Divine Story''], University of California Press, 1995. p 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Eliza Mayfield claimed to be Father Divine's mother. She stated that his real name was Frederick Edwards from [[Hendersonville, North Carolina]], and had abandoned a wife and five children, although Mayfield offered no proof and claimed to not remember his father's name. (Father Divine replied that "God has no Mother.")&lt;ref name="life19361207"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NkEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;f=true | title=Life on the American Newsfront: In Richmond, Virginia | work=Life | date=1936-12-07 | accessdate=February 23, 2013 | pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Divine's childhood remains a contentious point. Some, especially earlier researchers, suppose that he was born in the [[Deep South]], most likely in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], as the son of [[sharecroppers]]. Newer research by Jill Watts, based on [[US Census|census]] data, finds evidence for a George Baker, Jr. of appropriate age born in an African-American enclave of [[Rockville, Maryland]], called Monkey Run. If this theory is correct, his mother was a former slave named Nancy Baker, who died in May 1897. Most researchers agree that Father Divine's parents were freed [[African-American]] slaves. Notoriously poor records were kept about this generation of African Americans, so controversy about his upbringing is not likely to be resolved. On the other hand, he and his first wife, Peninnah, claimed that they were married on June 6, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;"Rumors Are Over: Father Divine Dies", ''Jet'' magazine, September 23, 1965, p20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton, ''Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America'' (Routledge, 2014) p145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"My Thirty Years with Father Divine", by Ruth Boaz, ''Ebony'' magazine (May 1965) p98&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Divine was probably called George Baker around the turn of the century. He worked as a [[gardener]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. In a 1906 sojourn in [[California]], Father Divine became acquainted with the ideas of [[Charles Fillmore (Unity Church)|Charles Fillmore]] and the [[New Thought Movement]], a philosophy of positive thinking that would inform his later doctrines. Among other things, this belief system asserted that negative thoughts led to poverty and unhappiness.  Songwriter [[Johnny Mercer]] credited a Father Divine sermon for inspiring the title of his song "[[Accentuate the Positive]]".&lt;ref name=pop40t1B&gt;{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ot&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Divine attended a local [[Baptist Church]], often preaching, until 1907, when a traveling preacher called Samuel Morris spoke and was expelled from the congregation. Morris, originally from [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]], had a soft-spoken and uncontroversial sermon until the end, when he raised his arms and shouted, "I am the Eternal Father!"  This routine had him thrown out of many churches in Baltimore, and was apparently unsuccessful until Morris happened upon the receptive Father Divine.

In his late 20s, Father Divine became Morris's first follower and adopted a [[pseudonym]], "The Messenger". The Messenger was a [[Christ]] figure to Morris's [[God the Father]]. Father Divine preached with Morris in Baltimore out of the home of former [[Evangelism|evangelist]] Harriette Snowden, who came to accept their [[divinity]]. Morris began calling himself "Father Jehovia."

Divine and Father Jehovia were later joined by John A. Hickerson, who called himself Reverend Bishop Saint John the Vine. John the Vine shared the Messenger's excellent speaking ability and his interest in [[New Thought Movement|New Thought]].

In 1912, the three-man ministry collapsed, as John the Vine denied Father Jehovia's [[monopoly]] on [[godhood]], citing [[First Epistle of John|1 John]] 4:15 to mean God was in everyone:

:"Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him and he in God."

Father Divine had finally parted ways with his former associates. Denying that Father Jehovia was God, and saying that everyone could not be God, he declared that he himself was God, and the only true expression of God's spirit.

===1912–14: In the South===
Father Divine traveled south, where he preached extensively in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. In 1913, conflicts with local ministers led to him being sentenced to 60 days in a [[chain gang]]. While he was serving his sentence, several prison inspectors were injured in an auto accident, which he viewed as the direct result of their disbelief.

Upon his release, he attracted a following of mostly black women in [[Valdosta, Georgia]]. He taught [[celibacy]] and the rejection of [[gender]] categorizations.

On February 6, 1914, several followers' husbands and local preachers had Divine arrested for [[lunatic|lunacy]]. This actually expanded his ministry, with reporters and worshippers deluging his prison cell. Some whites even began calling on him. Former [[Mercer University]] professor and lay preacher, J. R. Moseley of Macon, Georgia, befriended Divine and arranged for J. B. Copeland, a Mercer alum and respected Valdosta lawyer, to represent him ''[[pro bono]]''. Moseley was interested in what he termed "this unusual man" in his autobiography "Manifest Destiny." Decades later, in the 1930s, Moseley met Divine in New York City when he received word that the man going by that name might in fact be the same person he met in Georgia. Father Divine was found mentally sound in spite of "maniacal" beliefs. He had given no name when arrested and was tried as "John Doe (alias God)".

===1914–19: Brooklyn and marriage to Penninah===
In 1914, Father Divine traveled to [[Brooklyn, New York]], with a small number of followers and an all-black congregation. Although he claimed to be God incarnate fulfilling [[Bible|Biblical]] [[prophecy]], he lived relatively quietly.

He and his disciples formed a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] in a black [[middle-class]] [[apartment]] building. He forbade [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]] and [[gambling]] among those who were living with him. By 1919, he had adopted the name Reverend Major Jealous Divine. "[[Reverend]] [[Major]]" was chosen as a title of respect and authority, while "[[Jealousy|Jealous]]" was a reference to [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 34:14, where the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Lord]] says he is a "jealous god" and that God's name is Jealous. Exodus 34:14 His followers affectionately called him Father Divine.

In this period, Father Divine married a follower, Penninah, who was decades his senior.  Like Father Divine, her early life is obscure, but she is believed to be from [[Macon, Georgia]]. The date of the marriage is unknown but probably occurred between 1914 and 1917.

In addition to lending her dignified look to Father Divine, Penninah served to defuse rumors of impropriety between him and his many young female followers. Both Penninah, who was often called "Mother Divine", and Father Divine would assert that the marriage was never [[Consummate|physically consummated]].

===1919–31: Sayville, New York===
[[File:Father Divine House; Sayville, New York.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Father Divine's house in Sayville, New York.]]
Father Divine and his disciples moved to [[Sayville, New York]] (on [[Long Island]]), in 1919. He and his followers were the first black homeowners in town. Father Divine purchased his 72 Macon Street house from a resident who wanted to spite the neighbor he was feuding with. The two neighbors, both [[German American]]s, began fighting when one of them changed his name from Felgenhauer to Fellows in response to anti-[[Germany|German]] sentiment. His neighbor taunted him, and the feud escalated until Fellows decided to move. As a final insult, he specifically advertised his home for sale to a "colored" buyer to presumably lower his neighbors' property values.

In this period, his movement underwent sustained growth. Father Divine held free weekly banquets and helped newcomers find jobs. He began attracting many white followers as well as black. The [[Desegregation|integrated]] environment of Father Divine's communal house and the apparently flaunted wealth of his [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]] infuriated neighbors. Members of the overwhelmingly white community accused him of maintaining a large [[harem]] and engaging in [[scandal]]ous sex, although the [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] [[district attorney]]'s office found the claims baseless. Nonetheless, the neighbors continued to complain.

===1931–32: Sayville arrests, trial, notoriety, and prison===
On May 8, 1931, a Sayville deputy arrested and charged Father Divine with disturbing the peace. Remarkable during the [[Great Depression|Depression]], Father Divine submitted his $1000 bail in cash. The trial, not as speedy as the neighbors wanted, was scheduled for late fall, allowing Father Divine's popularity to snowball for the entire Sayville vacation season.

Father Divine held banquets for as many as 3000 people that summer. Cars clogging the streets for these gatherings bolstered some neighbors' claims that Father Divine ''was'' a disturbance to the peace and furthermore was hurting their property values.

On Sunday, November 15, at 12:15&amp;nbsp;am, a police officer was called to Father Divine's raucously loud property. By the time state troopers, deputies and prison buses were called in, a mob of neighbors had surrounded the compound. Fearing a [[riot]], the police informed Father Divine and his followers that they had fifteen minutes to disperse. Father Divine had them wait in silence for ten minutes, and then they filed into police custody. Processed by the county jail at 3&amp;nbsp;AM, clerks were frustrated, because the followers often refused to give their usual names and stubbornly offered the "inspired" names they adopted in the movement. Seventy-eight people were arrested altogether, including fifteen whites. Forty-six pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace and incurred $5 fines, which Father Divine paid with a [[Large denomination bills in U.S. currency|$500 bill]], which the court was embarrassingly unable to make change from. Penninah, Father Divine, and thirty followers resisted the charges.

Father Divine's arrest and heterodox doctrines were [[sensationalism|sensationally]] reported. The New York frenzy made this event and its repercussions the single most famous moment of Father Divine's life. Although mostly inaccurate, articles on Father Divine propelled his popularity. By December, his followers began renting buildings in [[New York City]] for Father Divine to speak in. Soon, he often had several engagements on a single night. On December 20, he spoke to an estimated 10,000 in [[Harlem, New York|Harlem]]'s [[Rockland Palace]], a spacious former basketball venue, Manhattan Casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By May 1932, meetings were regularly held at the Rockland and throughout [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. Father Divine had supporters in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], [[California]] and throughout the world thanks to [[New Thought Movement|New Thought]] devotees like Eugene Del Mar, an early convert and former Harlem journalist, and Henry Joerns, the publisher of a New Thought magazine in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]. Curiously, although the movement was predominantly black, followers outside the [[U.S. Northeast|Northeast]] were mostly [[middle class]] whites.

In this period of expansions, several branch communes were opened in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. Father Divine's followers finally named the movement: the [[International Peace Mission movement]].

Father Divine's trial was finally held on May 24, 1932. His lawyer, Ellee J. Lovelace, a prominent Harlem African American and former [[US Attorney]] had requested the trial be moved outside of [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], due to potential jury bias. The court acquiesced, and the trial took place at the [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] Supreme Court before Justice Lewis J. Smith. The jury found him guilty on June 5 but asked for leniency on behalf of Father Divine.  Ignoring this request, Justice Smith lectured on how Father Divine was a fraud and "menace to society" before issuing the maximum sentence for disturbing the peace, one year in prison and a $500 fine.

Smith, 55, died of a heart attack days later on June 9, 1932. Father Divine was widely reported to have commented on the death, "I hated to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thisfarbyfaith/journey_3/p_10.html |title=This Far by Faith . 1866-1945: from EMANCIPATION to JIM CROW |publisher=PBS |date=1938-07-31 |accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he wrote to his followers, "I did not desire Judge Smith to die.… I did desire that MY spirit would touch his heart and change his mind that he might repent and believe and be saved from the grave."

The impression that Justice Smith's death was [[divine retribution]] was perpetuated by the press, which failed to report Smith's prior heart problems and implied the death to be more sudden and unexpected than it was.

During his brief prison stay, Father Divine read prodigiously, notably on the [[Scottsboro Boys|Scottsboro Nine]]. After his attorneys secured release through an appeal on June 25, 1932, he declared that the foundational documents of the [[United States|United States of America]], such as the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], were inspired. Father Divine also taught that contemporary leaders strayed from these ideals, but he would become increasingly [[Patriotism|patriotic]] through his life.

===1932–42: Harlem===
[[File:Peace Mission Heaven.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The International Peace Mission movement established over 100 Heavens in the Northeastern United States.]]
Father Divine moved to [[Harlem, New York]], where he had accumulated significant following in the black community. Members, rather than Father Divine himself, held most deeds for the movement, but they contributed toward Father Divine's comfortable lifestyle. Purchasing several hotels, which they called "Heavens", members could live and seek jobs inexpensively. The movement also opened several budget enterprises, including restaurants and clothing shops, that sold cheaply by cutting overhead. These proved very successful in the depression. Economical, cash-only businesses were actually part of [[Doctrine of Father Divine|Father Divine's doctrine]].

By 1934, branches had opened in [[Los Angeles, California]], and [[Seattle, Washington]], and gatherings occurred in [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]], but the membership totals were drastically overstated in the press. ''[[Time Magazine]]'' estimated nearly two million followers, but the true figure of adherents was probably a few tens of thousands and a larger body of sympathizers who attended his gatherings. Nonetheless, Father Divine was increasingly called upon to offer political endorsements, which he initially did not. For example, [[New York City|New York]] mayoral candidates [[John P. O'Brien]] and [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia]] each sought his endorsement in 1933, but Father Divine was apparently uninterested.

An odd alliance between Father Divine and the [[Communist Party of America]] began in early 1934. Although Father Divine was outspokenly [[capitalism|capitalist]], he was impressed with the party's commitment to [[civil rights]]. The party relished the endorsement, although contemporary [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] records indicate some critics of the perceived huckster were expelled from the party for protesting the alliance.

In spite of this alliance, the movement was largely apolitical until the [[Harlem Riot of 1935]]. Based on a rumor of police killing a black teenager, it left four dead and caused over $1 million in property damage in Father Divine's neighborhood. Father Divine's outrage at this and other racial injustices fueled a keener interest in [[politics]]. In January 1939, the movement organized the first-ever "Divine Righteous Government Convention", which crafted political platforms incorporating the [[Doctrine of Father Divine]]. Among other things, the delegates opposed school [[Racial segregation#USA|segregation]] and many of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s social programs, which they interpreted as "handouts".

At the zenith of Father Divine's influence, several misfortunes struck the movement. &lt;!-- [[International Peace Mission movement#scandal|misfortunes struck the movement]]. --&gt;

On December 16, John Hunt, a white [[millionaire]] and disciple from [[California]] calling himself John the Revelator, met the Jewett family of [[Denver, Colorado]]. He kidnapped their 17-year-old daughter Delight and took her back to California without her parents' consent. Renaming her "Virgin Mary", John the Revelator began sexual relations with her. He announced that she would give birth to a "New Redeemer" by "[[immaculate conception]]" in [[Hawaii]]. Father Divine summoned Hunt to [[New York (state)|New York]], separated the couple and chastised his eccentric follower. The Jewetts, finding their daughter apparently [[mind control|brainwashed]] into believing she was literally the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], demanded compensation. After the movement's attorneys conducted an internal investigation, they refused. Outraged, the Jewetts offered their story to [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[New York Evening Journal]]'', an established critic of the movement. After a manhunt and trial, John Hunt was sentenced to three years and adopted a new name, the "Prodigal Son". Father Divine publicly endorsed the conviction of John the Revelator, contrary to some expectations (some followers expected him to once again "[[wikt:smite|smite]]" the judge). However, the scandal brought bad publicity to Father Divine. News coverage implied his followers were gullible and dangerous.

In March 1937, Penninah fell ill in [[Kingston, New York]]. Father Divine rarely comforted her on what was widely believed to be her deathbed. He kept running the church, only visiting her once in Kingston, again causing bad publicity. Penninah, however, claimed that she was not seriously ill or in pain.

On April 20, 1937, a violent outburst occurred in a meeting when two men tried to deliver Father Divine a summons. One of the men, Harry Green, was stabbed as Father Divine fled. Father Divine went into hiding to evade authorities.

During this time, one of Father Divine's most prominent followers, called Faithful Mary, defected and took control of a large commune, which was technically in her name. Of the Father she said, "he's just a damned man." She furthermore alleged that he defrauded his followers to maintain a rich lifestyle for himself. Faithful Mary also made a number of sexual allegations, including a charge that Father Divine coerced women to have sex with key disciples.

In early May, Father Divine was located and extradited from [[Connecticut]] and faced criminal charges in New York. That summer, [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst]]'s Metronone [[newsreel]] distributed mocking footage of Father Divine's followers singing outside police headquarters, "Glory, glory, hallelujah! Our God is in our land!"

Later in May 1937, an ex-follower called Verinda Brown filed a [[lawsuit]] for $4,476 against Father Divine.  The Browns had entrusted their savings with Father Divine in Sayville back in 1931. They left the movement in 1935 wishing to live as husband and wife again, but were unable to get their money back. In light of their evidence and testimony from Faithful Mary and others critical of the movement, the court ordered repayment of the money. However, this opened up an enormous potential liability from all ex-devotees, so Father Divine resisted and appealed the judgment.

In 1938, Father Divine was cleared of criminal charges and Mother Divine recovered. Faithful Mary, impoverished and broken, returned to the movement. Father Divine made her grovel for forgiveness, which she did. By the late 1930s, the movement stabilized, although it had clearly passed its [[zenith]].

Father Divine's political focus on anti-lynching measures became more resolved. By 1940, his followers had gathered 250,000 signatures in favor of an anti-lynching bill he wrote. However, passage of such statutes came slowly in New York and elsewhere.

The Verinda Brown lawsuit against Father dragged on and was sustained on appeal. In July, 1942, he was ordered to pay Brown or face [[contempt of court]]. Instead, Father Divine fled the state and re-established his headquarters in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. He still visited [[New York (state)|New York]], however. State law forbade serving [[subpoena]]s in New York on Sunday, so he often spoke on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] day in [[Harlem, New York|Harlem]], the Promised Land (his [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]] commune), and [[Sayville, New York|Sayville]].

===1942–65: Pennsylvania===
After moving to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], Father Divine's wife, Penninah, died. The exact date is not known, because Father Divine never talked about it or even acknowledged her death. However, it occurred sometime in 1943, and biographers believe Penninah's death rattled Father Divine, making him aware of his own mortality. It became obvious to Father Divine and his followers that [[Doctrine of Father Divine|his doctrine]] might not make one immortal as he asserted, at least not [[Mortification of the flesh|in the flesh]].

In 1944, singer/songwriter [[Johnny Mercer]] came to hear of one of Divine's sermons. The subject was "You got to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative." Mercer said, "Wow, that's a colorful phrase!”&lt;ref name=pop40t1B/&gt;&lt;ref name=ot/&gt;  He went back to Hollywood and got together with songwriter [[Harold Arlen]] ("[[Over The Rainbow]]"), and together they wrote "[[Ac-cent-tchu-ate The Positive]]", which was recorded by Mercer himself and the [[Pied Pipers]] in 1945.  It was also recorded by [[Bing Crosby]] with the [[Andrews Sisters]] that same year.

After his first wife died, Father Divine married a white [[Canadians|Canadian]] woman called [[Edna Rose Ritchings]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], on April 29, 1946. The ceremony was kept secret even from most members until Ritching's [[Visa (document)|visa]] expired. Critics of the movement believed that Father Divine's seemingly scandalous marriage to 21-year-old Ritchings would destroy the movement. Instead, most followers rejoiced, and the marriage date became a celebrated anniversary in the movement. To prove that he and Ritchings adhered to his doctrine on [[sexual abstinence]], Father Divine assigned a black female follower to be her constant companion.

He claimed that Ritchings, later called "Mother S. A. Divine", was the [[reincarnation]] of Penninah. Reincarnation was not previously part of [[Doctrine of Father Divine|Father Divine's doctrine]] and did not become a fixture of his theology. Followers believed that Penninah was an exceptional case and viewed her "return" as a [[miracle]].

Going into the 1950s, the press rarely covered Father Divine, and when it did, it was no longer as a menace, but as an amusing relic. For example, light-hearted stories ran when Father Divine announced [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] was capital of the world and when he claimed to inspire invention of the [[hydrogen bomb]]. Father Divine's predominantly lower-class following ebbed as the economy swelled.

[[File:Woodmont Moses King 1902.jpg|thumb|left|250px|"Woodmont" was Father Divine's home from 1953 until his death in 1965.]]
In 1953, follower John Devoute gave Father Divine [[Woodmont (Gladwyne, Pennsylvania)|Woodmont]], a 72-[[acre]] (0.3&amp;nbsp;km²) hilltop estate in [[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania]], outside of Philadelphia.  This French [[Gothic revival|Gothic]] manor served as his home and primary site of his increasingly infrequent banquets until his death in 1965.

As his health declined, he continued to petition for civil rights. In 1951, he advocated [[reparations for slavery|reparations]] to be paid to the descendants of slaves. He also argued in favor of integrated neighborhoods. However, he did not participate in the burgeoning [[American Civil Rights Movement]] because of his poor health and especially his dislike of the use of racial labels, denying he was black.

On September 10, 1965, Father Divine died of natural causes at his Woodmont estate. His widow and remaining followers insist his spirit is still alive and always refer to Father Divine in the present tense. Believers keep the furnishings of Father Divine's personal rooms at Woodmont just as they were as a shrine to his life.

[[Edna Rose Ritchings]] became spiritual leader of the movement. In 1972, she fought an attempt by [[Jim Jones]] to take over the movement's dwindling devotees. Jones based some of his doctrines on the [[International Peace Mission movement]] and claimed to be the reincarnation of Father Divine.  Although a few members of the Mission joined Peoples Temple after Jones made his play for leadership of the movement, the power push was, in terms of its ultimate objective, a complete failure. That Jones was 34 years old at the time of Father Divine's death made his claims of being a new incarnation rather hard to sustain - Jones claimed Divine's spirit had entered his body upon the passing of the elder man - and Ritchings was left unimpressed by Jones' impassioned rhetoric. Jones' custom of tape-recording all his sermons was copied from Divine, who "spoke" to his followers via archived sermon tapes once ill health forced him to cease speaking at meetings.

==Physical characteristics and preaching style==
Father Divine was a lightly built [[African American]] man at a diminutive 5′2″ (1.57&amp;nbsp;m). Through most of his life, he maintained a fastidious appearance and a neat moustache that he kept well groomed, his hair was invariably neatly combed, and since his days in [[Sayville, New York]], he almost always wore a suit in public.

Father Divine was said to be very [[charisma]]tic. His [[sermon]]s were emotionally moving and [[Free association (psychology)|freely associated]] between topics. His speech was often peppered with words of his own invention like "physicalating" and "tangiblated". An attendee at a Harlem "kingdoms" meeting in the 1930s recalled that he rhythmically intoned "Tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions. Tens, hundreds, ... millions.' Although this seemed nonsense to the visitor, he reported that at the end the true believers chanted, "Yes, he's God. Yes he's God."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rayford W. Logan]], "Father Divine," in ''Dictionary of American Negro Biography'', ed. by Rayford W. Logan and Michael R. Winston (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1982), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Other eccentricities were drawn from his doctrine. For example, nearly every sermon began with the greeting and exhortation "Peace!" Father Divine believed that ''peace'' should replace ''hello''.

==Doctrine==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2007}}
Father Divine preached of his [[divinity]] even before he was known as "Father Divine" in the late 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;''God, Harlem U.S.A: the Father Divine story'', Jill Watts, Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1992 {{ISBN|0-520-07455-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctrine taught that his life fulfilled all [[Bible|Biblical]] prophecies about the [[second coming]], regarding himself as [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] reborn. Father Divine also lectured that Christ existed in "every joint" of his follower's bodies, and that he was "God's light" incarnated in order to show people how to establish heaven on earth and to show them the way to eternal life. For example:

:Condescendingly I came as an existing Spirit unembodied, until condescendingly inputting MYSELF in a Bodily form in the likeness of men I came, that I might speak to them in their own language, coming to a country that is supposed to be the Country of the Free, where mankind is privileged to serve GOD according to the dictates of his own conscience...establishing the Kingdom of GOD in the midst of them; that they might become to be living epistles as individuals, seen and read of men, and verifying what has long been said:

::"The tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and God Himself shall be with them, and he shall be their God, and they shall be his people."
:{{spaced ndash}}quoted in ''Peace Mission Movement'' p. 62, [[Mrs. S. A. Divine]], 1985 and ''God, Harlem, U.S.A.'' p. 178, Jill Watts, 1992.

Father Divine and his followers [[Capitalization|capitalize]]d [[pronoun]]s referring to him, much like "[[Lord|LORD]]" translated from the [[tetragrammaton]] is capitalized in the [[English Bible]].

Father Divine's definition of God became quite celebrated at the time because of its unusual use of language: "God is not only personified and materialized. He is repersonified and rematerialized. He rematerialized and He rematerialates. He rematerialates and He is rematerializatable. He repersonificates and He repersonifitizes."

=== Positive thought ===
Father Divine can be considered part of the [[New Thought Movement]]; indeed, many of his white followers came from this tradition.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

=== Welfare ===
Father Divine was particularly concerned with the downtrodden of society, including but not limited to Blacks. He was opposed to people accepting welfare.

=== Race ===
Scholars disagree about whether Father Divine, an [[African American]], was a civil rights activist, but he certainly advocated some progressive changes to race relations. For example, because he believed that every human was accorded [[Civil rights|equal rights]], he believed that all members of [[Lynching|lynch mobs]] ought to be tried and convicted as murderers. Father Divine's anti-lynching campaigns resonated in the black [[ghetto]]s where his congregations lived, and he got over a quarter million people to sign his anti-lynching proposals.

=== Patriotism ===
Father Divine advocated that followers think of themselves as simply [[United States|Americans]]. He believed that America was the birthplace of the "Kingdom of God", which would ultimately encompass truths of all religious principles, promoting equality and brotherhood. The Movement was supportive of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], and particularly the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as inspired documents, believing that they outlined a more ideal life.

=== Communal living ===
Toward this life, followers of Father Divine owned and managed property collectively. The movement strove to alleviate poverty by feeding the poor and through education in written [[English language|English]], which the Movement believed was the "universal language."

=== Chastity ===
Father Divine established an "International Modesty Code" which forbids [[tobacco|smoking]], [[alcohol (drug)|drinking]], and [[profanity]]. Additionally, it forbade tips, bribes, receiving presents, and "undue mixing of the sexes," along with women wearing slacks or short skirts and men wearing short-sleeves.

Although Father Divine himself was married, the movement discouraged marriage, along with any excessive mingling of the sexes. In the "Heavens" and other living spaces the Movement maintained, separate areas existed for men and women.

=== Thrift and Business Practices ===
Father Divine advocated a number of economic practices, which his followers abided by. He opposed [[life insurance]] (which converts were to cancel), [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], [[social security]], and [[credit (finance)|credit]]. Thus, the Movement advocated economic self-sufficiency. His insistence that his followers refuse welfare not related to employment was estimated to have saved New York City $2 million during the Depression.

Business owners in the Movement named their ventures to show affiliation with Father Divine, and obeyed all of these practices. They dealt only in cash, refusing credit in any of its forms. Each was to sell below competitor's prices while refusing any sorts of tips or gratuities. Finally, they refrained from trade in alcohol or tobacco.

==Legacy==

===Civil rights===
Some biographers, such as Robert Weisbrot, speculate that Father Divine was a forerunner to the [[Civil Rights Movement]] during the 1950s and 1960s, heavily influenced by his upbringing in the [[Racial segregation#USA|segregated]] South. Others, such as Jill Watts, reject not only this characterization, but also the theory that Father Divine grew up in the [[Deep South]]. Watts asserts that Rockville was less oppressive than the South or even [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and believes his civil rights positions are unintelligible without evaluating them in the context of the [[Doctrine of Father Divine]].

Although Father Divine strove extensively against [[lynching]] and [[bigotry]], he accepted many of the negative characteristics assigned [[African Americans]]. He concluded that those who identified themselves as "black" manifested these characteristics. In short, he believed blacks perpetuated their own oppression by thinking racially. He once said that he was not poor because he did not belong to a poor downtrodden race&amp;mdash;that he was not black.

===Religious===
[[Edna Rose Ritchings]] (Mother Divine) conducted services for the old and dwindling congregation until her death. The movement owns several properties, such as Father Divine's Gladwyne estate Woodmont, his former home in [[Sayville, New York]], and the Circle Mission Church on Broad Street in Philadelphia, which also houses the movement's library.

Chapters exist in  [[Pennsylvania]] and possibly elsewhere, but the movement is not centralized and exists through a number of interrelated groups.

In 2004, ''[[Gastronomica]]'' magazine published an article about Mother S. A. Divine and the movement's feasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Divine Liturgy|work=Gastronomica |date=Winter 2004 |volume= 4| number=1 |pages= 19–24 | DOI=10.1525/gfc.2004.4.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[Divine Lorraine Hotel]] near [[Temple University]] on North Broad Street was sold off by the international Peace Mission Movement. It was a budget hotel with separate floors for men and women in accord with Father Divine's teachings. The Divine Tracy Hotel in [[West Philadelphia]] was sold in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://campusphilly.org/2006/10/11/losing-the-divine-in-philadelphia/ |title= Losing the Divine in Philadelphia |date= October 11, 2006 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160205171842/http://campusphilly.org/2006/10/11/losing-the-divine-in-philadelphia/ |archivedate= February 5, 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Cameroon]] provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the Government generally respected this right in practice. Government policy contributes to the generally free practice of religion. There were no reports of [[societal abuses]] and [[religious discrimination|discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice. The country is generally characterized by a high degree of religious tolerance.

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Cameroon}}
[[Muslim]] centers and [[Christian]] churches of various [[religious denomination|denominations]] operate freely throughout the country. Approximately 70 percent of the population is at least nominally Christian, 20 percent is at least nominally Muslim, and 10 percent practice traditional [[indigenous religious beliefs]]. The Christian population is divided approximately equally between [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] denominations. Christians are concentrated chiefly in the southern and western provinces and Muslims reside in large numbers in every province. Traditional indigenous religious beliefs are practiced in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practiced publicly in cities.

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice. The Government at all levels sought to protect this right in full and did not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors. There is no official [[state religion]].

Christian and Islamic holy days are celebrated as [[public holiday|national holidays]]. These include the Christian [[Liturgical year|holy days]] of [[Good Friday]], [[Ascension Day]], [[Assumption Day]], and [[Christmas Day]], and the Islamic holy days of the [[Feast of the Lamb]] and [[Eid al-Fitr]], the End of [[Ramadan]].

The [[Law on Religious Congregations]] governs relations between the Government and religious groups. The [[Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization]] (MINATD) must approve and register religious groups in order for them to function legally. There were no reports that the Government refused to register any group; however, the process can take a number of years. It is illegal for a religious group to operate without official recognition, but the law prescribes no specific penalties. There was a growth within the major cities of so-called "sects," which their leaders consider to be subgroups of Protestant denominations; few of these are registered, and all of them operate freely. Although official recognition confers no general tax benefits, it allows religious groups to receive real estate as tax-free gifts and legacies for the conduct of their activities.

To register, a religious denomination must legally qualify as a religious [[wikt:congregation|congregation]]. The definition includes "any group of natural persons or corporate bodies whose vocation is divine worship" or "any group of persons living in community in accordance with a religious doctrine." The denomination then submits a file to the MINATD. The file must include a request for authorization, a copy of the group's charter describing planned activities, and the names and functions of the group's officials. The Minister reviews the file and sends it to the presidency with a recommendation to approve or deny. The president generally follows the recommendation of the Minister and grants authorization by a presidential decree. The approval process may take up to several years.

The only religious groups known to be registered are Christian, Muslim, and [[Bahai]]. According to the latest [[MINATD]] statistics (released in 2002), there are 38 officially registered denominations, most of which are Christian. There also are numerous unregistered small religious groups that operate freely. The Government does not register traditional indigenous religious groups, stating that the practice of traditional religion is a private concern observed by members of a particular ethnic or kinship group or the residents of a particular locality.

The MINATD, rather than the judiciary, primarily resolves disputes between or within registered religious groups about control of places of worship, schools, other real estate, or financial assets.

[[Missionary]] groups are present and operate without impediment. The licensing requirements for foreign groups are the same as those for domestic religious denominations.

The practice of [[witchcraft]] is a criminal offense under the national penal code, punishable by a 2 to 10-year prison term.

Several religious denominations operate [[primary schools|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s. Although post-secondary education continues to be dominated by state institutions, [[private school]]s affiliated with religious denominations, including Catholic, Protestant, and [[Qur'anic]] schools, have been among the best schools at the primary and secondary levels for many years. The law charges the [[Ministry of Basic Education]] and the [[Ministry of Secondary Education]] with ensuring that private schools run by religious groups meet the same standards as state-operated schools in terms of curriculum, infrastructure, and teacher training. For schools affiliated with religious groups, the [[Sub-Department of Confessional Education of the Department of Private Education]] performs this oversight function. School attendance—at public, private, or parochial schools—is mandatory through junior high school. The campuses of the [[Central Africa Catholic University]], [The Cameroon Christian University] and the [[International Adventist University]] are located in the country.

The Presbyterian Church in Cameroon operates one of the country's few modern private printing presses and also the Roman Catholic Church publishes a weekly newspaper through its own Modern printing press.

A 2000 government decree requires potential commercial radio broadcasters to submit a licensing application, pay a fee when the application is approved, and pay an annual licensing fee. The Government has been slow in granting authorization; consequently, there are many unauthorized radio stations operating. Two private religious radio stations, the [[Pentecostal]] Radio [[Bonne Nouvelle]] and [[Radio Reine]] (managed by a Catholic priest although not officially sponsored by the Catholic Church), that had been broadcasting without licenses continued to broadcast while awaiting official authorization, as do many other radio stations awaiting their licenses. The Catholic station Radio Veritas has temporary authorization to broadcast and has been broadcasting without incident.

The state-sponsored television station, [[Cameroon Radio Television|CRTV]], carries two hours of Christian programming on Sunday mornings, normally an hour of Catholic Mass and an hour of a Protestant service. There is also one broadcast hour dedicated to Islam on Friday evenings. State-sponsored radio broadcasts Christian and Islamic religious services on a regular basis, and both the radio and television stations periodically broadcast religious ceremonies on national holidays or during national events. State television occasionally broadcasts ecumenical ceremonies on major occasions such as the commemoration of a national event.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion.

The practice of witchcraft is a criminal offense under the national penal code. People generally are prosecuted for this offense only in conjunction with some other offense such as murder; however, there were no reports of convictions of witchcraft under this law. The Government distinguishes between witchcraft and traditional indigenous religious practices; witchcraft is defined by the law as attempts to do harm by spiritual means and is a common explanation for diseases.

There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of [[forced religious conversion]], including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States. In 2004 the Government responded promptly to assist the U.S. Embassy in the case of the forced conversion of American citizens by a private actor.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
There were no reports of [[societal abuses]] or [[discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice; however, some religious groups reported societal hostility within their regions. Established churches denounced new unaffiliated religious groups, most of which are individually motivated Tele-ministries, as "[[sects]]" or "[[cult]]s," claiming that they were detrimental to societal peace and harmony. In practice, such denunciation did not inhibit the practice of the unaffiliated religious groups. In the northern provinces, especially in rural areas, societal hostility by Muslims against Christians and persons who practice traditional indigenous religious beliefs continued.

When there have been natural disasters, or to commemorate national events, Christians and Muslims organized [[ecumenical]] ceremonies to pray and promote a spirit of tolerance and peace.

'''Freedom of religion in [[Comoros]]''' is addressed in the [[Constitution of the Comoros|constitution]]. However, there are limitations to this right in practice. While government authorities continued to prohibit [[Christians]] from [[proselytizing]], there were no known instances where the local authorities and population restricted the right of Christians to practice other aspects of their faith. There was societal discrimination against non-[[Muslims]] in some sectors of society; however, accounts of social pressure were anecdotal. Proselytizing for any religion except Islam is illegal, and converts from Islam may be prosecuted under the law. However, such prosecutions are rare and have not resulted in any convictions in recent years.&lt;ref name="2009 Report"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127225.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report of 2009 |author=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] |date=October 26, 2009 |work= |publisher= [[US Department of State]] |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, there were reports of family and community members excluding non-Muslim converts from schools or villages for "evangelizing Muslims".&lt;ref name="2009 Report"/&gt;

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Comoros}}
The country has an area of {{convert|838|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 711,000. Ninety-nine percent of the population is [[Sunni Muslim]]. There is no sharp divide between Sunni and [[Shi'a]], and most Muslims respect the doctrinal differences between the two branches of Islam. Foreigners living on the islands number several hundred, and include [[Hindus]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and members of other Christian groups including [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Protestants]].

A few foreign religious groups maintain humanitarian programs, but by agreement with the Government, they did not engage in proselytizing.

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, but the Government continued to limit this right in practice. In 2009, an amendment to the Constitution added that Islam is "the religion of the state."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comoros's Constitution of 2001 with Amendments through 2009|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Comoros_2009.pdf|website=Constitute Project|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Constitution states that Islam is the "permanent inspiration of the principles and rules that govern the Union."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The 2002 Constitution reincorporates [[Ndzuwani]] ([[Anjouan]]), [[Ngazidja]] ([[Grande Comore]]), and [[Moheli]] into a new federation that grants the islands greater autonomy. There are no legal restrictions that prevent Christians from attending church, and non-citizen Christians are allowed to practice their faith without government intervention as long as they do not attempt to convert citizens. Foreigners caught proselytizing for religions other than Islam are subject to [[deportation]].

While the law allows non-Muslims to practice their religion, it prohibits citizens from converting from Islam. The 2002 amended Constitution upholds religious freedom; however, the pre-existing [[Penal Code]] prohibits conversion from Islam and has yet to be modified to reflect this standard. Although enforceable, this law is rarely applied.

Government authorities continue to prohibit non-Muslims from proselytizing. A law dating from the early 1980s states "whoever divulges, promotes, or teaches Muslims a religion other than Islam will be punished with a three-month prison sentence and a fine of 50,000 to 500,000 [[Comoran Francs]]." However, in practice the government does not impose this fine.

The [[Grand Mufti]] is part of the Government and manages a department that handles issues concerning religion and religious administration. The Grand Mufti's position is attached to the [[Ministry of Islamic Affairs (Comoros)|Ministry of Islamic Affairs]], and he counsels the Government on matters of Islamic faith and ensures that Islamic laws are respected. He is nominated by the President. The Grand Mufti periodically consults with a group of elders to assess whether the principles of Islam are respected, and he regularly addresses the nation on the radio regarding social and religious issues such as marriage, divorce, and education.

While the study of Islam is not compulsory in public schools, the tenets of Islam are sometimes taught in conjunction with the [[Arabic language]] in [[State school|public schools]] at the [[middle school]] level. There are no separate provisions made for religious minorities in public schools; however, foreigners can request that their children not receive Islamic instruction or Arabic language training. Almost all children between the ages of 4 and 7 also attend schools to learn to recite and understand the [[Qur'an]], although attendance is not compulsory for religious minorities. There are more than 10 private schools on the island of Ngazidja (Grande Comore), none of which are specifically non-Muslim.

Several Islamic holy days, including the [[Islamic New Year]], the [[Birth of the Prophet Muhammad]], and [[Eid al-Fitr]], are [[public holiday|national holidays]].

The flag of Comoros contains Muslim symbols: crescents and stars on a green background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comoros Flag and Description|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/flags/countrys/africa/comoros.htm|website=World Atlas|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government does not require religious groups to be licensed, registered, or officially recognized.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
The Government does not ban specific religions or religious factions. The Government allows organized religious groups to establish places of worship, train clergy to serve believers, and assemble for peaceful religious activities. However, proselytizing for any religion except Islam is illegal and foreigners caught proselytizing for religions other than Islam were subject to deportation under the law.

In 2013, a law was passed establishing the Sunni Shafi'i doctrine as the only allowable religious practice in the country and placing sanctions on all other religious practice on the grounds of avoiding social unrest and the undermining of national cohesion and unity. The government states it ratified the law due to fears of religious radicalization.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comoros|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2013religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|website=US State Department Report on Religious Freedom 2013|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no reports of government sponsorship of speech or materials that foster intolerance or hatred toward any religious groups.

The Government does not prohibit, restrict, or punish parents for raising their children in accordance with religious teachings and practices of their choice.

There are no specific religious requirements for membership in the ruling party.

The Government did not designate religion on passports or national identity documents, either explicitly or in code.

The Government prohibited the distribution of religious literature, clothing, and symbols. The [[International Church of Moroni]] was allowed to import 10,000 gift boxes in April 2007 provided the boxes did not contain religious literature, symbols, or clothing. In 2006 the organization was prohibited from distributing gift boxes of toys for local children containing [[cross necklaces]]. In 2006 authorities on Grande Comores barred the nongovernmental organization (NGO) [[Who Will Follow Me?]], created by the Protestant Church in Moroni, from distributing imported T-shirts emblazoned with the NGO's name in Comoran.

Bans on alcohol and immodest dress are enforced sporadically, usually during religious months, such as [[Ramadan]]. Alcohol can be imported and sold with a permit from the Government.

===Abuses of religious freedom===
On July 6, 2006, in a general amnesty decreed by President [[Ahmed Abdallah Sambi]] in celebration of [[Independence Day (Comoros)|Independence Day]], prisoners were released who had been arrested in the preceding 6 months. Among them were four citizens who were convicted of "evangelizing Muslims" for hosting Christian religious debates in a private residence. There are rarely cases of religious detainees or prisoners. This was the only reported instance where the Government imposed fines, later waived, for unauthorized religious activity. Local police supported the village of [[Ndruani]]'s decision to chase out the "evangelizers."

In 2013 and 2014, the government did not allow non-Sunni Muslim citizens to establish places of worship or assemble for peaceful religious activities.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comoros|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|website=US State Department Report on Religious Freedom 2014|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of [[forced conversion|forced religious conversion]], including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
{{See also|Societal abuses|Religious discrimination}}
There is societal discrimination against non-Muslims, particularly Christians, in some sectors of society. All citizens face societal pressure to practice elements of Islam, particularly during the month of Ramadan. Most societal pressure and discrimination occurs behind closed doors at the village level, far from the eyes of the Government or media. The extent of de facto discrimination typically depends on the level of involvement of local Islamic teachers. Most non-Muslim citizens did not openly practice their faith for fear of societal rejection. Persons who raise their children with non-Muslim religious teachings face societal discrimination. Societal pressure and [[intimidation]] continued to restrict the use of the country's three churches to non-citizens.

There is concern that Islamic fundamentalism is increasing as young citizens return to the country following Islamic theological studies abroad and seek to impose a stricter adherence to [[Islamic religious law]] on their family members and associates; in response, the [[Union Government]] has established a university to give young citizens the option of pursuing university studies in the country.

The '''Gulf and Arabian Peninsula Unity Forum''' (Arabic: منتدى وحدة الخليج والجزيرة العربية) known as the Gulf Arab Unity Forum, is the first of its kind,{{when|date=May 2018}} meant to create a central coalition of Gulf unity in the Arabian Peninsula. This forum is associated with numerous controversial topics and people regarding terrorism and terror financing.

==Description==
Its objective, as stated by the general coordinator of the conference, Fahd Albmal, was to create a union to mirror that of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]], aimed at discussing broad political reforms and social and political development throughout the gulf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/news/600553.html|title=انطلاق منتدى "وحدة الخليج والجزيرة" غداً بحضور 400 مشارك|last=المحلية|first=المنامة - محرر الشئون|language=ar-AR|access-date=2016-07-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321023124/http://www.alwasatnews.com/news/600553.html|archivedate=2018-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also indicated that it required four months of planning through the formation of a number of committees and Gulf leaders to complement the GCC. Adel Ali Abdullah, the spokesperson for the conference, stated that these countries, including [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], [[Qatar]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], and [[Oman]], were looking to ensure the stability of these countries and hopefully have [[Yemen]] join the league. Additionally, he indicated that they hoped to combat the dangers facing the region that threaten their Islamic identity and foreign security risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.turess.com/alhiwar/23844|title=منتدى وحدة الخليج والجزيرة العربية يطالب بقرار سياسي يضع الكنفدرالية موضع التنفيذ|access-date=2016-07-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321023124/https://www.turess.com/alhiwar/23844|archivedate=2018-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its promotion, the forum indicated that it gathered political and intellectual elites ranging from academic thinkers, writers, politicians, and journalists from all of the Gulf States in the pretext of a forum or conference, representing all spectrums of society and doctrines of thought.

==Conference==
The conference was attended by 400 individuals from the 6 GCC countries, and hoped to publicize further this union.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Ugforumgulf/info?tab=page_info{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a series of seminars by 6 speakers over two days. At the end of the conference, the forum issued a statement calling on all citizens and the institutions of civil society to participate in achieving the objectives of the forum, which included comprehensive reform of the governments and people within the countries represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alislaah.net/site/showthred.php?id=1992|title=مؤتمر "وحدة الخليج والجزيرة العربية": أمن واستقرار الخليج لا يتحقق إلا بالإصلاح الشامل والشراكة بين الأنظمة والشعوب _ دعوة الإصلاح|last=Azm|first=Mohamed Abou El|website=www.alislaah.net|access-date=2016-07-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011190418/http://www.alislaah.net/site/showthred.php?id=1992|archivedate=2016-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference met in Bahrain at the Diplomat Hotel on October 14, 2011, lasting two days. This founding conference was held under the patronage of King [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa]], and was promoted via social media accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tarteeb.org/%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AF%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AC/#!|title=Unity of the Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula {{!}} Tarteeb|website=tarteeb.org|access-date=2016-07-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710105148/http://tarteeb.org/%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AF%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AC/#!|archivedate=2016-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its Facebook and Twitter account this forum was meant be its inaugural panel. However, the Facebook page has not been active since the completion of that meeting in October 2011, nor has it been reported that a forum of that scale occurred since then.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Ugforumgulf{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, its Twitter page, followed by over 1,300 accounts, has been active between the initiation of the conference and April 2014. Its tweets include [[YouTube]] links to various workshops and updates of forum and board meetings that have occurred in Bahrain and [[Paris]]. Furthermore, it has tweeted various provocative statements including ones that refer to [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood]] protesters who died in escalated protests as [[Allah]]’s martyrs.

It is reported that at the conference, the forum announced stances on controversial issues such as the [[Syrian civil war|Syrian Civil War]] and the insurgencies in Yemen stating that they should use whatever means necessary to fight back their repressive states and any form of aggression. They also discussed Western dangers that threaten Islamic identity.

==Board of trustees==
Additionally, during the conference a [[Board of directors|board of trustees]] was chosen, listing six individuals from each country represented, or 36 in total. Of these 36 individuals, at least 4 are known terrorists or are associated with [[terrorist group]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s/activities including Saad bin Saad al –Kaabi, an al Qaeda financier and U.S. sanctioned terrorist, Abdul Rahman bin Omair al-Naimi, another [[Al-Qaeda|al Qaeda]] financier and U.S. designated terrorist, Hassan Ahmed al-Diqqi, an extremist al Ummah party leader and [[Syrian opposition|Syrian rebel]] financier, and Abdullah Abdul Qader Ahmad Ali al-Hajiri, a [[Muslim Brotherhood]] activist, who has been convicted of treason and jailed in the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0143.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Financial Supporters of Al-Qaida and Al-Nusrah Front|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=2016-07-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821115131/https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0143.aspx|archivedate=2016-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2249.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Al-Qa’ida Supporters in Qatar and Yemen|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=2016-07-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804063641/https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/jl2249.aspx|archivedate=2016-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/private-donations-give-edge-to-islamists-in-syria-officials-say/2013/09/21/a6c783d2-2207-11e3-a358-1144dee636dd_story.html|title=Twitter-powered donation networks provide lifeline to radical Islamist groups in Syria|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-07-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804192458/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/private-donations-give-edge-to-islamists-in-syria-officials-say/2013/09/21/a6c783d2-2207-11e3-a358-1144dee636dd_story.html|archivedate=2016-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mesbar.org/research-article/uaes-brotherhood-problem/|title=The UAE’s Brotherhood Problem - Al-Mesbar Center|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/uae-convicts-69-islamists-of-plotting-overthrow-gov-t-507504.html#.V3arqfkrKUl|title=UAE convicts 69 Islamists of plotting to overthrow gov't|access-date=2016-07-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712052553/http://www.arabianbusiness.com/uae-convicts-69-islamists-of-plotting-overthrow-gov-t-507504.html#.V3arqfkrKUl|archivedate=2013-07-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albayan.ae/across-the-uae/2013-07-02-1.1914775|title=بالفيديو..أحكام تراوحت بين السجن 15 سنة و البراءة لأعضاء التنظيم السري|date=2013-07-02|language=ar-AR|access-date=2016-07-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114171058/http://www.albayan.ae/across-the-uae/2013-07-02-1.1914775|archivedate=2017-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold Egbert Camping''' (July 19, 1921{{spaced ndash}}December 15, 2013) was an American [[Christian radio]] broadcaster, author and [[evangelism|evangelist]].&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Christian radio host tells listeners to abandon church|date=January 23, 2003|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20030123-0904-ca-apocalypseradio.html|accessdate=May 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1958, he served as president of [[Family Radio]], a [[California]]-based radio station group that broadcasts to more than 150 markets in the United States.

==Biography==
Harold Egbert Camping was born on July 19, 1921, in [[Boulder, Colorado]] and moved at an early age to California.{{when|date=May 2011}} Both his parents came from the [[Netherlands]] – his mother from [[Friesland]], his father from [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] – but they first met each other in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= Holland Doc: Het kaf en het koren |url= http://www.hollanddoc.nl/kijk-luister/documentaire/k/holland-doc-het-kaf-en-het-koren.html |network= [[Evangelische Omroep]] |airdate= February 23, 2012: 22:55 |minutes= 57 |language= Dutch, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, Camping earned a B.S. degree in [[civil engineering]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; In 1943, he married his wife, Shirley.&lt;ref name=WhoIsHC/&gt; He and his family were members of the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]] until 1988.

===Family Radio===
{{Main|Family Radio}}
[[File:Judgment Day 21 May 2011 (English).jpg|thumb|A [[Family Radio]] sign in [[Denver]] predicting the end of the world on May 21, 2011.]]
In 1958, Camping joined with other individuals of [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed]], Bible [[Baptists|Baptist]], and conservative [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] backgrounds to purchase an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio station in [[San Francisco]], California. The radio station – [[KEAR (AM)|KEAR]], then at 97.3 [[megahertz|MHz]] – was used to broadcast traditional Christian [[Gospel]] to the conservative [[Protestantism|Protestant]] community and [[Christian ministry|minister]] to the general public.&lt;ref name="Family Radio's Biography"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who or What is Family Radio?|url=http://www.familyradio.com/english/connect/bio/haroldcamping_bio.html|publisher=Family Stations, Inc|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526081054/http://www.familyradio.com/english/connect/bio/haroldcamping_bio.html|archivedate=May 26, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1960s, Family Radio acquired six additional FM stations and seven other [[AM broadcasting|AM]] stations under guidelines established by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).&lt;ref name="Multiple Ownership; Radio Broadcast Stations"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Multiple Ownership; Radio Broadcast Stations|url=http://www.sba.gov/advo/laws/comments/dfcc02_0313.txt|publisher=Small Business Administration|accessdate=May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Family Radio began running the Open Forum, a live, weeknight call-in program that Camping hosted until 2011.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; Listeners were invited to call in, primarily with questions about the meaning of certain passages from the Bible, and Camping answered them by means of interpretations, often with reference to other Biblical passages. Occasionally, questions were posed relating to general Christian doctrine, ranging from the nature of sin and salvation to matters involving everyday life, such as marriage, sexual morality and education.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; The Open Forum continued running until Camping's partial retirement in July 2011,&lt;ref name=stroke3/&gt; and was broadcast on the more than 150 stations owned by Family Radio in the United States. The Open Forum was also translated into many foreign languages and (together with other Family Radio programming) was broadcast worldwide via [[shortwave]] station [[WYFR]], a network of [[AM radio|AM]] and [[FM radio]] stations, a cable television station and the [[Internet radio|Internet]]. In October 2012, over a year after the failure of Camping's prophecies, Family Radio began airing repeats of his broadcasts.&lt;ref name=YearLater/&gt;

Family Radio runs various programs on its radio stations. Before Camping started teaching that the "Church Age" had ended, programs produced outside of Family Radio were welcome provided they did not accept any "extra-Biblical revelation", and were associated with teachings accepted by the historic Christian faith. Family Radio also utilized at least three television stations: [[WNYJ-TV|WFME-TV]] in the New York City area; [[KCNZ-CD|KFTL-CD]] in [[San Francisco]], California; and [[KZTN-LD|KHFR-LD]] in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], Idaho. Following the [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital transition]] of 2009, Family Radio used its [[subchannel]]s of WFME and KFTL for various purposes – in WFME's case, the digital signal of that station broadcasts ten separate subchannels, the first being the main channel, and the others carrying audio feeds of other Family Radio services, as well as one broadcasting [[NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards|NOAA Weather Radio]].

Family Radio spent over US$100&amp;nbsp;million on the information campaign for Camping's [[2011 end times prediction]], financed by sales and swaps of broadcast outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.latimes.com/la-me-rapture-20110521,0,1687317.story |title = Doomsday prediction: Harold Camping is at the heart of a mediapocalypse over his Doomsday prediction |last = Goffard |first = Christopher |date = May 21, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate =May 23, 2011 |location = Oakland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Biblical Calendar of History''===
In 1970, Camping published ''The Biblical Calendar of History'' (later greatly expanded in his 1974 book ''Adam When?''), in which he dated the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] of the world to the year 11,013 BC and the [[Noah's Ark|Flood]] to 4990 BC. This was in contradiction to Bishop [[James Ussher]]'s famous 17th-century [[Ussher chronology|chronology]], which placed the Creation at 4004 BC and the Flood at 2349 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Jay Gould. [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_house-ussher.html ''Fall in the House of Ussher'']. ''Natural History''. November 1991. Retrieved January 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Camping argued that Ussher's dates "agree neither with the Biblical nor the secular evidence", asserting that Ussher's methodology was flawed.&lt;ref name=JASA&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.asa3.org/asa/PSCF/1970/JASA9-70Camping.html|author=Harold Camping|publisher=[[American Scientific Affiliation]]|volume=22|date=September 1970|accessdate=July 14, 2008|title=The Biblical Calendar of History|journal=JASA|pages=98–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camping surmised that the word ''begat'' in the Old Testament scriptures did not necessarily imply an immediate father-son relationship, as had been assumed by Ussher and others who (Camping felt) had not correctly interpreted the biblical timeline. Camping noted the use of the phrase "called his name" ("''qara shem''" in Hebrew, found three times in Genesis 4–5), which he characterized as a "clue phrase" to indicate an immediate father-son relationship.&lt;ref name=JASA/&gt; Despite the fact that this "clue phrase" does not occur regarding Noah naming Shem, Camping maintained that there is enough evidence to otherwise conclude that they did, in fact, have an immediate father-son relationship. He also points out the use of ''qara shem'' in Isaiah 7:14, which he interpreted as meaning, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."&lt;ref name="JASA"/&gt;

Camping assumed that, since ''qara shem'' implies an immediate father-son relationship (e.g., Adam–Seth, Seth–Enos, and Lamech–Noah), all other relationships between the Antediluvian patriarchs (except Noah–Shem) are of ancestors and their distant descendants. That is, when one patriarch died, the next one who is mentioned was not his son but was actually a distant multi-generational grandson who was born in that same year. Camping thus formulated the concept of the "reference patriarch,"&lt;ref name="SpecialSeries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nestheology.org/2011/05/11/special-series-engineering-judgment-day-may-21-2011-part-ii/|title=Special Series: Engineering Judgment Day – May 21, 2011 Part II|publisher=New England School of Theology|date=May 11, 2011|accessdate=July 11, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308195716/http://www.nestheology.org/2011/05/11/special-series-engineering-judgment-day-may-21-2011-part-ii/|archivedate=March 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., various events are referenced to a specific year of a particular patriarch's life as a means of keeping an accurate chronological record. Although there is no evidence that any ancient civilization kept track of time in this way,&lt;ref name=JASA/&gt; Camping used this concept as the basis for his view of Biblical chronology.&lt;ref name="SpecialSeries"/&gt;

==Teachings==
Camping taught that a Biblical calendar had been hidden according to Daniel 12:9 and Revelation 22:10, detailing the imminent end of the world (with alleged Biblical evidence pointing to the date for the Rapture as May 21, 2011);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/01/BA8V1AV589.DTL|work=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Biblical scholar's date for rapture: May 21, 2011|author=Justin Berton|date=January 1, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the "end of the church age" (which asserts that churches are no longer the vehicle used by God for salvation, 1 Peter 4:17);&lt;ref name="Shiflett"&gt;{{cite news|title=Depart Out! A call for Christians to leave their churches – the End Times may be here|last=Shiflett|first=Dave|date=February 1, 2002|work=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[predestination]] (Ephesians 1:4–5), according to which God determined before the beginning of the world which individuals are to be [[salvation|saved]]. In Camping's later publications, he stated that May 21, 2011 would be "the first day of the Day of Judgment"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/judgment/judgment.html |title=Judgment Day |publisher=Familyradio.com |date=May 21, 2011 |accessdate=May 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625155605/http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/judgment/judgment.html |archivedate=June 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and October 21, 2011 would be the end of the world.&lt;ref name=waat/&gt;

Camping did not consider Family Radio a church and did not claim ordained or hierarchical authority within a church or institution. Camping claimed that the church institutions do not employ the Bible alone as the sole authority. According to Camping, each church or denomination has its own unique set of [[doctrine]]s and [[hermeneutics]], which dictate how they understand the Bible. Family Radio's sole focus on the Bible is what he believed distinguishes it from mainstream churches. In his book ''1994?'', he claimed there was a very high likelihood that the world would end in September 1994, although he did acknowledge in the book "the possibility does exist that I could be wrong";&lt;ref&gt;Harold Camping (1992). ''1994?''. New York: Vantage Press. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Family Radio remained popular despite this failed prediction. Both before and after the failure of his 2011 prophecies, Camping received criticism from a number of leaders, scholars, and laymen within the Christian community, who argued that Jesus Christ taught that no man knows the day or the hour of the Lord's return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A36-44&amp;version=NIV |title=Matthew 24:36–44 – Passage Lookup – New International Version |publisher=BibleGateway.com |accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan |url=http://stuffchristianslike.net/2011/01/precisely-predicting-the-end-of-the-world/ |title=Precisely predicting the end of the world. Stuff Christians Like – Jon Acuff |publisher=Stuffchristianslike.net |date=January 15, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camping responded to those who labelled him a "[[Rapture#Date|date-setter]]", following his own method of Biblical interpretation, by asserting that he followed the Bible's method of interpretation.&lt;ref name="Harold Camping"&gt;{{cite web|title=First Principles of Bible Study|url=http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/study/study_contents.html|author=Harold Camping|publisher=Family Stations, Inc|accessdate=June 23, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509074529/http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/study/study_contents.html|archivedate=May 9, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Camping's teaching was his belief that the Bible alone is the word of God in its entirety, and thus is absolutely trustworthy. However, he emphasized, this does not mean that each sentence in the Bible is to be understood only literally. Rather, the meaning of individual Biblical passages also needs to be interpreted in the light of two factors. The first is the context of the Bible as a whole. The second is its spiritual meaning. In Camping's words, "the Bible is an earthly story with a Heavenly meaning." This stems from Mark 4:34, which states that Jesus did not speak to the disciples without using parables. Because Christ is said to be the living [[Logos (Christianity)|Word of God]], therefore, the historical accounts of the Old Testament can also be seen as parables. For example, in Camping's view, [[Joshua]] in the [[Book of Joshua]] (whose name in Hebrew is identical to the name "Jesus" in Greek) is a picture of Christ, who safely led the Israelites (who supposedly represented those who became saved) across the Jordan River (a representation of the wrath of God) into the land of Canaan (which represents the kingdom of God).&lt;ref&gt;Harold Camping (2005). ''Time Has an End''. New York: Vantage Press. pp. 224–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===
After leaving the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]] in 1988, Camping taught doctrines that explicitly conflicted with the doctrines and confessions of the Christian Reformed Church and churches of the Reformed and Presbyterian traditions. Examples of Camping's teachings which varied from conventional Reformed doctrines include:
* Departing from [[Calvinist]] doctrine, Camping taught a relative free will for humanity and that humans are not [[Total depravity|totally depraved]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Please explain what Romans 2:14...|url=http://fsiforms.familyradio.org/dbqf/forum_021307e.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909223433/http://fsiforms.familyradio.org/dbqf/forum_021307e.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 9, 2010|author=Harold Camping|publisher=Family Radio|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he subscribed to the idea that salvation is unmerited, cannot be achieved by good works or prayer, and is a pure act of God's grace.
* Departing from the doctrine of eternal torment for the unsaved in a place called [[Hell]], Camping taught [[annihilationism]]; that life will end and existence will cease for the unsaved soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/glory/glory_3.html |title=To God be the Glory! |publisher=Familyradio.com |accessdate=May 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515033806/http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/glory/glory_3.html |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Departing from scriptural doctrines stating no one can know the time of Christ's second coming, Camping taught (until 2011) that the exact time of the Rapture and the end of the world would be revealed sometime towards the end of time (as per the [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 12:9–13 prophecy).
* Camping taught that all churches have become [[apostasy|apostate]] and thus must be abandoned. He encourages personal [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] and listening to his Family Radio broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The End of the Church Age...and After|url=http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/church/church_contents.html|author=Harold Camping|publisher=Family Stations Inc|accessdate=June 16, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810223559/http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/church/church_contents.html|archivedate=August 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Questions on the End of the Church Age|url=http://www.zinyi.com/Scripts/Job1/ZinYi/Four%20Questions%20ZY.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End times calculations===
Camping's teachings regarding the timing of Christ's [[second coming]] were based on the cycles of:
* [[Jewish holiday|Jewish feast days]] in the [[Hebrew calendar]], as described in the Old Testament,
* the [[lunar month]] calendar (1 synodic month = 29.53059 days), and
* a close approximation of the [[Gregorian calendar]] tropical year (365.24219 days, rounded to 365.2422).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/19/may-21-end-of-the-world_n_863938.html?page=2 |title=May 21, 2011: A Portrait of True Believers in the ‘End of the World’ |work=Huffington Post |date=September 6, 1994 |accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He projected these cycles into modern times and combined the results with other information in the Bible.&lt;ref name="timehasanend.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timehasanend.org/contents.html|title=Time Has an End: A Biblical History of the World 11,013 B.C.&amp;nbsp;– 2011 A.D.|accessdate=April 9, 2008|author=Harold Camping|publisher=Family Stations, Inc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404091628/http://www.timehasanend.org/contents.html|archive-date=April 4, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quote&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpt from "God's Magnificent Salvation Plan" |url=http://www.quoteland.com/author.asp?AUTHOR_ID=2328|author=Harold Camping|publisher=Quoteland.com|accessdate=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Camping, Harold|title=A Biblical Calendar of History|publisher=Family Radio|url=http://worldwide.familyradio.org/zusa/graphical/literature/calendar/calendar_contents.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929152456/http://worldwide.familyradio.org/zusa/graphical/literature/calendar/calendar_contents.html|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Camping, Harold|title=The Ultimate Terror: Judgment Day|publisher=Family Radio|url=http://worldwide.familyradio.org/zusa/graphical/literature/terror/terror_contents.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927130723/http://worldwide.familyradio.org/zusa/graphical/literature/terror/terror_contents.html|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camping's [[date of the crucifixion|date for the crucifixion]] of Christ – Friday, April 1, AD 33

''Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ'' Zondervon Publishing House. p. 65–114.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dates differ because Camping used the Gregorian calendar, while most commentators use the older Julian calendar, which had a two-day difference during the 1st century AD (they now differ by thirteen days).

In 1992, Camping published a book titled ''1994?'', in which he proclaimed that Christ's return might be on September 6, 1994. In that publication, he also mentioned that 2011 could be the end of the world. Camping's predictions use 1988 as a significant year in the events preceding the apocalypse; this was also the year he left Alameda Bible Fellowship. As a result, some individuals criticized him for "date-setting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Perkins, Donald|title=The Dangers of Date Setting|publisher=According to Prophecy Ministries|date=December 1, 1996|url=http://www.according2prophecy.org/datesetting.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camping's later publications, ''We are Almost There!'' and ''To God be The Glory'', referred to additional Bible passages which, in his opinion, pointed to May 21, 2011, as the date for the Rapture and October 21, 2011, as the date for the end of the world.

Camping gained notoriety owing to his prediction that the [[Rapture]] would take place on May 21, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flashnews.com/news/wfn05100730fn12605.html |title=Jesus Returning to Earth On May 21, 2011 |publisher=Flashnews.com |date=July 30, 2010 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailymaverick.co.za/article/2010-08-16-may-21-2011-judgment-day-believers-descend-on-joburg |title=May 21, 2011: Judgment Day believers descend on Joburg |work=The Daily Maverick |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Conversation With Harold Camping, Prophesier of Judgment Day|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/05/a_conversation_with_harold_cam.html|work=New York Magazine Website|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the [[end time|end of the world]] would subsequently take place five months later on October 21, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebiblefellowship.com/may21/index.html |title=May 21, 2011 – Judgment Day!; October 21, 2011 – The End of the World |publisher=Ebiblefellowship.com |date=May 21, 1988 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of Camping claimed that around 200 million people (approximately 2.8% of the world's 2011 population) would be raptured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/judgment/judgment.html |title=Judgment Day |publisher=Familyradio.com |accessdate=November 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625155605/http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/judgment/judgment.html |archivedate=June 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and publicized the prediction in numerous countries. It has also been reported that a 14-year old Russian girl named Nastya Zachinova committed suicide over his prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Garcia|first1=Elena|title=Fearful Teen Commits Suicide Due to Harold Camping's Judgment Day Prediction|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/fearful-teen-commits-suicide-on-eve-of-harold-campings-rapture-50542/|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reuters]] reported on May 21 that the curtains were drawn in Camping's house in [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], California, and that no one was answering the door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/21/us-apocalypse-prediction-idUSTRE74I3KS20110521 |last=Saveri |first=Gabrielle |title=Broadcaster silent as Judgment Day hours tick by |agency=Reuters |date=May 21, 2011 |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camping emerged from his home on May 22, saying he was "flabbergasted" that the Rapture had not occurred. He stated that he was "looking for answers," and would say more when he returned to work on May 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harold Camping 'flabbergasted' world didn't end |last=Kane |first=Will |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/05/22/BAKO1JJIK7.DTL&amp;tsp=1 |date=May 22, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2011, in an appearance before the press, Camping stated he had reinterpreted his prophecy. In his revised claim, May 21 was a "spiritual" judgment day, and the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the destruction of the world.&lt;ref name="ibtimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auibt"&gt;Garance Burke.

Associated Press. May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Camping said his company would not return money donated by followers to publicize the failed May 21 prediction, stating: "We’re not at the end.

''New York Times''. May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atheist]] and [[skeptic]] groups such as [[American Atheists]] and [[IIG]] gathered across the country with signs attracting attention away from Camping's followers who were in [[seclusion]]. "The issue is the Bible is mythology," said Larry Hicok, state director of American Atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/05/22/BAKO1JJIK7.DTL#ixzz1OWzV8LUc | work=SF Gate | date=May 22, 2011 | title= Harold Camping 'flabbergasted'; rapture a no-show }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, mainstream Christian groups distanced themselves from Camping's predictions.&lt;ref name="An Autumn Date for the Apocalypse" /&gt;

In September 2011, Camping and several other prognosticators who incorrectly predicted various dates for the end of world were jointly awarded an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for "teaching the world to be careful when making mathematical assumptions and calculations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/09/29/winners_of_the_2011_ig_nobel_awards/?rss_id=Boston.com+--+Massachusetts+news|title=Winners of the 2011 Ig Nobel Awards|publisher=Boston Globe|date=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wasabi alarm, beetle sex win Ig Nobel spoof prizes|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/sns-rt-us-nobel-spooftre78s6vp-20110929,0,3616048.story|work=Baltimore Sun|date=September 29, 2011}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, [[News24]] reported that the size of Camping's congregation had dwindled to "about 25 adults on a typical Sunday".&lt;ref name=NoDawn&gt;[http://www.news24.com/World/News/Judgment-Day-doesnt-dawn-20111021 "Judgement Day doesn't dawn"].

===Aftermath===
In March 2012, Camping admitted that his predictions were in error, stating: "We humbly acknowledge we were wrong about the timing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/end_of_world_predictions_were.html Last year's Apocalyptic predictions were wrong, preacher admits].

'''Hinduism''' is the second largest religious affiliation in '''Bangladesh''', covering about 8.96% of the population, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics for [[2011 Bangladesh census]]. In terms of population, [[Bangladesh]] is the third largest Hindu state in the world after [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. According to an estimate from the [[Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics]] (BBS), there were 17{{nbsp}}million Hindus in Bangladesh as of 2015.&lt;ref name="bbs"/&gt;

In nature, Bangladeshi [[Hinduism]] closely resembles the forms and customs of Hinduism practised in the neighbouring Indian state of [[West Bengal]], with which Bangladesh (at one time known as [[East Bengal]]) was united until the partition of India in 1947. The vast majority of Hindus in Bangladesh are [[Bengali Hindus]].

The Goddess (''[[Devi]]'') – usually venerated as [[Durga]] or [[Kali]] – is widely revered, often alongside her consort [[Shiva]]. The [[Shaivism|worship of Shiva]] has generally found adherents among the higher castes in Bangladesh. [[Vaishnavism|Worship of Vishnu]] (typically in the form of his ''[[Avatar]]s'' or [[incarnation]] [[Rama]] or [[Krishna]]) more explicitly cuts across caste lines by teaching the fundamental oneness of humankind in spirit. [[Vishnu]] worship in Bengal expresses the union of the male and female principles in a tradition of love and devotion. This form of Hindu belief and the [[Sufi]] tradition of Islam have influenced and interacted with each other in Bengal. Both were popular mystical movements emphasizing the personal relationship of religious leader and disciple instead of the dry stereotypes of the [[brahmin]]s or the [[Ulema|ulama]]. As in Bengali Islamic practice, worship of Vishnu frequently occurs in a small devotional society (''shomaj''). Both use the language of earthly love to express communion with the divine. In both traditions, the [[Bengali language]] is the vehicle of a large corpus of mystical literature of great beauty and emotional impact.

In Bangladeshi Hinduism ritual bathing, vows, and pilgrimages to sacred rivers, mountains, and shrines are common practice. An ordinary Hindu will worship at the shrines of Muslim ''[[pir (Sufism)|pir]]s'', without being concerned with the religion to which that place is supposed to be affiliated. Hindus revere many [[Sadhu|holy men]] and [[ascetic]]s conspicuous for their bodily mortifications. Some believe that they attain spiritual benefit merely by [[Darśana|looking at a great holy man]]. [[Durga Puja]], held in September–October, is the most important festival of Bangladeshi Hindus and it is widely celebrated across Bangladesh. Thousands of pandals (mandaps) are set up in various cities, towns and villages to mark the festival. Other festivals are [[Kali Puja]], [[Janmashtami]], [[Holi]], [[Saraswati Puja]], [[Shivratri]] and [[Rathayatra]], the most popular being the century-old [[Dhamrai Rathayatra]].

The principle of ''[[ahimsa]]'' is expressed in almost universally observed rules against eating beef. By no means are all Bangladeshi Hindus vegetarians, but abstinence from all kinds of meat is regarded as a "higher" virtue. Brahmin (''Brahmon'') or "Upper-caste" Bangladeshi Hindus, unlike their counterparts elsewhere in South Asia, ordinarily eat fish and chicken. This is similar to the Indian state of West Bengal which has a similar climate to that of Bangladesh, where Hindus also consume fish, egg, chicken and mutton.There are also non-Bengali Hindus in Bangladesh,majority of the [[Hajong]], [[Rajbongshi people]] and [[Tripuris]] in Bangladesh are Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.refworld.org/docid/49749d5841.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:Shivastatuedhaka.jpg|thumbnail|right|Statue of Hindu Goddess Saraswati, Dhaka University]]
According to the 2001 census there are 11,379,000 Hindus in Bangladesh. However, some estimates show that there are about 12 million Hindus in Bangladesh. Hindus in Bangladesh in the late 2000s were almost evenly distributed in all regions, with large concentrations in [[Gopalganj District, Bangladesh|Gopalganj]], [[Dinajpur District (Bangladesh)|Dinajpur]], [[Sylhet]],  [[Sunamganj]], [[Mymensingh]], [[Khulna]], [[Jessore]], [[Chittagong]] and parts of [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. In the capital city of [[Dhaka]], Hindus are the second-largest religious community after the Muslims and the largest concentration of Hindus can be found in and around [[Shankhari Bazaar]] of the old city. The contributions of Hindus in arts, education, literature and sports are far in excess of their numerical strength. In politics, they have traditionally supported the liberal and secular ideology of the [[Awami League]] and other left wing parties such as [[Communist Party of Bangladesh]] (CPB), and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD). However, barring the fundamentalist &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/hrfeatures/HRF48.htm |title=Attacks on Hindu Minorities in Bangladesh |publisher=Hrdc.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamist parties such as [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]], all the major political parties have fielded Hindu candidates. In the current [[Jatiyo Sangshad]], out of 350 members, there are only 13 Hindus: most of them from the [[Awami League]]. Hindu institutions and places of worship received assistance through the Bangladesh Hindu Kalyan Trust (Bangladesh Hindu Welfare Trust), which was sponsored by the Ministry of Religious Affairs.  Government sponsored Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar (radio) broadcast readings and interpretations of Hindu scriptures and prayers.

Since the rise of more explicitly [[Islamist]] political formations in Bangladesh during the 1990s, many Hindus have been intimidated or attacked, and fairly substantial numbers are leaving the country to India.&lt;ref name="amnesty"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2013/03/bangladesh-wave-violent-attacks-against-hindu-minority/ |title=Bangladesh: Wave of violent attacks against Hindu minority |date=6 March 2013 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In present-day Bangladesh, Hindus became a minority only in mid-thirteenth century of the Gregorian Calendar.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In 1941 the Hindus formed about 28% of the population, which declined to 22.05% in 1951, as rich and upper caste Hindus migrated to India after [[Partition of India]] in 1947. The wealthy Hindus who migrated lost their land and assets through the ''East Bengal Evacuee Act'' and the poor and middle-class Hindus that were left behind became targets of discrimination through new laws. At the outbreak of the [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1965|1965 India-Pakistan war]], the ''Defense of Pakistan Ordinance'' and later the ''Enemy (Custody and Registration) Order II'', through which the Hindus were labelled as the "enemy" and their property expropriated by the state.&lt;ref name=Lintner&gt;{{citation|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|title=Great Game East: India, China, and the Struggle for Asia's Most Volatile Frontier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p--5BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152|date=1 April 2015|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-21332-4|pages=152–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Costa2011"&gt;{{citation|last=D'Costa|first=Bina|title=Nationbuilding, Gender and War Crimes in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ivzKjY5LncIC&amp;pg=PA100|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-56566-0|pages=100–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/Door-out-of-Dhaka/articleshow/5962198.cms|title=Door out of Dhaka Rema Nagarajan|accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has dropped by about half. Through a combination of mass exodus and genocide in the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities]] by the [[Pakistan Army]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], this represents a loss of around 20 million Bangladeshi Hindus and their direct heirs, and reflects one of the largest displacements of population based on ethnic or religious identity in recent history. 1974 census of Bangladesh showed that the population of Hindus had fallen to 13.5%. Even after independence, the Hindus were branded "Indian stooges" and untrustworthy citizens.&lt;ref name=Lintner/&gt; A significant driver of Hindu emigration has been the Enemy Property Act, later renamed as the [[Vested Property Act]], through which the Bangladesh Government has been able to appropriate the property of around 40% of the existing Bangladeshi Hindu population (according to Dr Abul Barkat of [[Dhaka University]]).

A significant portion of the middle-class, urban Hindu population left the region that is now Bangladesh immediately after the partition in 1947 when [[East Pakistan]] came into existence. Many of these [[East Bengali refugees]] went on to contribute actively to Indian society after their migration. In 1971, during the [[Liberation War of Bangladesh]] from Pakistan, a similar scenario happened. But even after 1971, Hindu population has continued to decline and currently they form 8.96% of the population. According to a study by Pew Research Organisation, Hindus will constitute 7% of the population of Bangladesh by 2050, while Muslims will form 92% of the population.

Despite their dwindling numbers, Hindus still yield considerable influence because of their geographical concentration in certain regions. They form a majority of the electorate in at least two parliamentary constituencies (Khulna-1 and Gopalganj-3) and account for more than 25%  in at least another thirty. For this reason, they are often the deciding factor in parliamentary elections where victory margins can be extremely narrow. It is also frequently alleged that this is a prime reason for many Hindus being prevented from voting in elections, either through intimidating actual voters, or through exclusion in voter list revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/01/04/d6010401033.htm |title=Hindu areas in Ctg still out of listing |publisher=archive.thedailystar.net |date= |accessdate=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an estimate from the [[Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics]] (BBS), there were 17{{nbsp}}million Hindus in Bangladesh as of 2015, out of a total 158.9{{nbsp}}million population.&lt;ref name="bbs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangladesh’s Hindus number 1.7 crore, up by 1 p.c. in a year: report|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Bangladesh%E2%80%99s-Hindus-number-1.7-crore-up-by-1-p.c.-in-a-year-report/article14397035.ece|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=23 June 2016|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu temples==
{{main article|List of Hindu temples in Bangladesh}}
[[File:Kantaji Temple Dinajpur Bangladesh (12).JPG|200px|thumbnail|left|[[Kantajew Temple]] in Dinajpur, Bangladesh]]
[[File:Durga puja in Dhakeshwari temple.jpg|right|thumb|Puja celebrations in [[Dhakeshwari Temple]]]]

Hindu temples and shrines are more or less distributed all across the country. The [[Kantaji Temple]] is an elegant example of an 18th-century temple. The most important temple in terms of prominence is the [[Dhakeshwari Temple]], located in [[Dhaka]]. This temple along with other Hindu organizations arranges [[Durga Puja]] and [[Krishna Janmaashtami]] very prominently. The other main temples of Dhaka are the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], [[Joy Kali Temple]], [[Laxmi Narayan Mandir, Dhaka|Laxmi Narayan Mandir]], [[Swami Bagh Temple]] and Siddheswari Kalimandir. The famous [[Ramna]] Kali Temple in Dhaka was destroyed by the [[Pakistani Army]] during the [[Liberation War of Bangladesh]] in 1971, and Bangladeshi Hindus have been actively petitioning successive governments since independence to rebuild the temple on the site, where a massacre of around 100 devotees also took place.

Built in the early 19th century, [[Kal Bhairab Temple]] at [[Brahmanbaria]] holds the largest deity of [[Shiva]] in the country. Other notable Hindu temples and ashrams  of Bangladesh are [[Chandranath Temple]], [[Adinath Temple, Maheshkhali|Adinath Temple]], [[Sugandha]], [[Jeshoreshwari Kali Temple]], [[Pancha Ratna Govinda Temple]], [[Bhabanipur Shaktipeeth]], [[Chatteshwari Temple]], [[Dhamrai Jagannath Rath]], [[Puthia Temple Complex]], [[Kantajew Temple]], [[Comilla Jagannath Temple]], Kaliyajeu Temple, [[Shri Shail]], Bishwanath Temple, [[Boro Kali Bari Temple]], Muktagacha Shiva Temple, Shyamsundar Temple, Chandrabati Temple, Lalmai Chandi Temple, Jorbangla Temple, [[Sonarang Twin Temples]], [[Jagannath Temple, Pabna]], [[Temple of King Kangsa Narayan]], Barodi Lokenath Ashram, [[Sri Satyanarayan Seva Mandir]], [[Sri Angan]], [[Wahedpur Giri Dham]], Ramkrishna Sevashram at Chittagong, Ram Thakur Ashram etc.

Many Hindu temples have suffered from implementation of the [[Vested Property Act]] through which land and moveable property has been confiscated by agents acting on behalf of successive governments. Hindu temples are also high risk areas during communal disturbances (most recently in 1990, 1992 and 2001) when it has often been necessary to call the army to protect sensitive locations.

==Community issues==
[[File:Bara Shiva Temple, Puthia (Front).jpg|thumb|The Temple at Puthia, Rajshahi]]

The Hindu community has many similar issues as the predominant Muslim community of Bangladesh. These include women's rights, dowry, poverty, unemployment and others. Issues unique to the Hindu community include maintenance of [[Hindu culture]] and temples in Bangladesh. Small sects of Islamists constantly try to politically and socially isolate the Hindus of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="jagran.com"&gt;http://www.jagran.com/punjab/bhatinda-14966442.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jagran.com"/&gt; Because Hindus of Bangladesh are scattered across all areas (except in [[Narayanganj]]), they cannot unite politically. However, Hindus became sway voters in various elections. Hindus have usually voted in large mass for [[Bangladesh Awami League]] and communist parties, as these are the only parties which have a nominal commitment to secularism;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.albd.org/index.php/party/constitution?lang=bn&lt;/ref&gt; the alternatives are the increasingly pro-Islamist centrist parties such as the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] and [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] (which both incorporate Muslim identity into their version of [[Bangladeshi nationalism]] or the outright Islamist [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]] (an offshoot of the Pakistan-based [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]]) which seeks to establish Islamic law under which there would be separate provisions for Hindus as non-Muslims. However, Hindus in general maintain cordial relationships with liberal Muslims and they even participate in each other's festivals such as [[Durga Puja]] and [[Eid al-Fitr]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Bangladesh Liberation and 1971 Bangladesh atrocities (1971)===
{{main article|Bangladesh Liberation War|1971 Bangladesh atrocities|Operation Searchlight}}
The Bangladesh Liberation War resulted in one of the largest genocides of the 20th century. While estimates of the number of casualties was 3,000,000, it is reasonably certain that Hindus bore a disproportionate brunt of the Pakistan Army's onslaught against the Bengali population of what was East Pakistan. As many as 2.4 million Bengali Hindus were killed by the Pakistani Army during the Liberation War and most of the Bengali Hindu-owned businesses were permanently destroyed. The historic Ramna Kali Temple in Dhaka and the century-old  Rath at Dhamrai were demolished and burned down by the Pakistani Army.

An article in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] dated 2 August 1971, stated "The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military hatred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=World: Pakistan: The Ravaging of Golden Bengal |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,878408,00.html |magazine=Time |date=2 August 1971 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] wrote in a report that was part of [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] testimony dated 1 November 1971, "Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked "H". All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from [[Islamabad]]". In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as [[UNESCO]] and [[World Health Organization]] the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. Given that the Hindu population in East Pakistan was around 11 million in 1971, this suggests that up to 8 million, or more than 70% of the Hindu population had fled the country.

The [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalist [[Sydney Schanberg]] covered the start of the war and wrote extensively on the suffering of the East Bengalis, including the Hindus both during and after the conflict. In a syndicated column "The Pakistani Slaughter That Nixon Ignored", he wrote about his return to liberated Bangladesh in 1972. "Other reminders were the yellow "H"s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army" (by "Muslim army", meaning the [[Pakistan Army]], which had targeted Bengali Muslims as well), ([[Newsday]], 29 April 1994).

===The initial post-independence period (1972–75)===
In the first constitution of the newly independent country, secularism and equality of all citizens irrespective of religious identity was enshrined. On his return to liberated Bangladesh, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] in his first speech to the nation, specifically recognized the disproportionate suffering of the Hindu population during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. On a visit to [[Kolkata]], India in February 1972, Mujib visited the refugee camps that were still hosting several million Bangladeshi Hindus and appealed to them to return to Bangladesh and to help rebuilding the country.

Despite the public commitment of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his government to re-establishing secularism and rights of non-Muslim religious groups, two significant aspects of his rule remain controversial as relates to the conditions of Hindus in Bangladesh. The first was his refusal to return the premises of the [[Ramna Kali Mandir]], historically the most important temple in Dhaka, to the religious body that owned the property. This centuries old Hindu temple was demolished by the Pakistan army during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and around one hundred devotees murdered. Under the provisions of the Enemy Property Act it was determined that ownership of the property could not be established as there were no surviving members to claim inherited rights, and the land was handed over to the [[Dhaka Club]].

Secondly, state-authorized confiscation of Hindu owned property under the provisions of the Enemy Property Act was rampant during Mujib's rule, and as per the research conducted by Abul Barkat of [[Dhaka University]], the [[Awami League]] party of Sheikh Mujib was the largest beneficiary of Hindu property transfer in the past 35 years of Bangladeshi independence. This was enabled considerably because of the particular turmoil and displacement suffered by Bangladeshi Hindus, who were the primary target of the Pakistan army's genocide, as well documented by international publications such as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] and the ''[[New York Times]]'', and by the declassified [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission]] report. With almost 8 million displaced Hindus and more than 200,000 Hindu victims of [[genocide]], it was difficult to establish direct ownership of property within legally specified timeframes. This caused much bitterness among Bangladeshi Hindus, particularly given the public stance of the regime's commitment to [[secularism]] and communal harmony.

Largely because of these and other factors, such as the lack of attention to the Human Rights Violations of Hindus in the country, the Hindu population of Bangladesh started to decline through migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/hrfeatures/HRF13.htm |title=Home - South Asia Human Rights Documentation Centre (SAHRDC) |publisher=Hrdc.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Rahman and Hussein regimes (1975–1990)===
President [[Ziaur Rahman]] abandoned the constitutional provision for secularism and began to introduce Islamic symbolism in all spheres of national life (such as official seals and the constitutional preamble). Zia brought back the [[multi-party]] system thus allowing organizations such as [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]] (an offshoot of the [[Islamist]] [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] in Pakistan) to regroup and contest elections.

In 1988 President Hussein Mohammed Ershad declared Islam to be the State Religion of Bangladesh. Though the move was protested by students and left-leaning political parties and minority groups, to this date neither the regimes of the BNP or Awami League has challenged this change and it remains in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D71530F93BA35755C0A96E948260 |title=Bangladesh Parliament Votes To Make Islam State Religion |publisher=New York Times |date=8 June 1988 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Ershad regime was widely blamed for negligence (and some human rights analysis allege active participation) in the [[anti-Hindu]] riots following the [[Babri Mosque]] incident in India, the largest communal disturbances since Bangladesh independence, as a means of diverting attention from the rapidly increasing opposition to his rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrcbm.org/NEWLOOK/1992.html |title=Primary Report |publisher=Hrcbm.org |date=31 October 1990 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/international_relations/archives/107/78290f.pdf |title=South Asia: Afghanistan |publisher=[[United States House Committee on International Relations]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229052501/http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/archives/107/78290f.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hindu temples, Hindu neighbourhoods and shops  were attacked and damaged including, for the first time since 1971, the [[Dhakeshwari]] temple. The atrocities were brought to the West's attention by many Bangladeshis, including [[Taslima Nasrin]] and her book [[Lajja]] which translated into English means "shame".

===Return to democracy (1991–present)===
Hindus were first attacked in mass on 1992 by [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalists]]. More than 200 temples were destroyed. Hindus were attacked and many women were raped and killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ia.rediff.com/news/2006/mar/22spec.htm?q=tp&amp;file=.htm |title=The truth about Bangladesh's Hindus |publisher=Ia.rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events were widely seen as a repercussion against the razing of the Babri Mosque in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1609049.stm |title=SOUTH ASIA &amp;#124; Analysis: Fears of Bangladeshi Hindus |publisher=BBC News |date=19 October 2001 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taslima Nasrin]] wrote her novel ''[[Lajja]]'' (The Shame) based on this persecution of Hindus by Islamic extremists. The novel centers on the suffering of the patriotic anti-Indian and pro-Communist Datta family, where the daughter is raped and killed while financially they end up losing everything.

[[File:Festival of sacred bath (Baruni snan- in Bengali) in Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|Hindu festival in Bangladesh]]
Prominent political leaders frequently fall back on "Hindu bashing" in an attempt to appeal to extremist sentiment and to stir up communal passions. In one of the most notorious utterances of a mainstream Bangladeshi figure, the immediate past Prime Minister [[Khaleda Zia]], while leader of the opposition in 1996, declared that the country was at risk of hearing "uludhhwani" (a Hindu custom involving women's [[ululation]]) from mosques, replacing the azaan (Muslim call to prayer) (e.g., see Agence-France Press report of 18 November 1996, "Bangladesh opposition leader accused of hurting religious sentiment").&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51616.htm |title=Bangladesh |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the election of 2001, when a right-wing coalition including two Islamist parties ([[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]] and [[Islami Oikya Jote]]) led by the pro-Islamic right wing  [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) came to power, many minority Hindus and liberal secularist Muslims were attacked by a section of the governing regime. Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus were believed to have fled to neighbouring India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1657018.stm |title=SOUTH ASIA &amp;#124; India state warns of Bangladesh refugees |publisher=BBC News |date=15 November 2001 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to escape the violence unleashed by activists sympathetic to the new government. Many Bangladeshi Muslims played an active role in documenting atrocities against Hindus during this period.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1645499.stm |title=SOUTH ASIA &amp;#124; Bangladesh Hindu atrocities 'documented' |publisher=BBC News |date=8 November 2001 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new government also clamped down on attempts by the media to document alleged atrocities against non-Muslim minorities following the election. Severe pressure was put on newspapers and other media outside of government control through threats of violence and other intimidation. Most prominently, the Muslim journalist and human rights activist [[Shahriyar Kabir]] was arrested on charges of treason on his return from India where he had been interviewing Hindu refugees from Bangladesh; this was&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1756064.stm |title=SOUTH ASIA &amp;#124; Bangladesh scribe arrest 'illegal' |publisher=BBC News |date=12 January 2002 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Bangladesh High Court and he was subsequently freed.

The fundamentalists and right-wing parties such as the BNP and [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] often portray Hindus as being sympathetic to India, and transferring economic resources to India, contributing to a widespread perception that Bangladeshi Hindus are disloyal to the state. Also, the right wing parties claim the Hindus to be backing the [[Awami League]].&lt;ref name="amnesty" /&gt;
As widely documented in international media, Bangladesh authorities have had to increase security to enable Bangladeshi Hindus to worship freely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2310359.stm |title=South Asia &amp;#124; Security fears for Hindu festival |publisher=BBC News |date=8 October 2002 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; following widespread attacks on places of worship and devotees.

After [[17 August 2005 Bangladesh bombings|recent bombings]] in Bangladesh by the Islamic fundamentalists, the government has taken steps to strengthen the security during various minority celebrations, specially during Durga Puja and Rathayatra.

On October 2006, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom published a report titled 'Policy Focus on Bangladesh', said that since its last election, 'Bangladesh has experienced growing violence by religious extremists, intensifying concerns expressed by the country's religious minorities'. The report further stated that Hindus are particularly vulnerable in a period of rising violence and extremism, whether motivated by religious, political or criminal factors, or some combination. The report noted that Hindus had multiple disadvantages against them in Bangladesh, such as perceptions of [[dual loyalty]] with respect to India and religious beliefs that are not tolerated by the politically dominant [[Islamic Fundamentalists]] of the BNP. Violence against Hindus has taken place "in order to encourage them to flee in order to seize their property". The previous reports of the [[Hindu American Foundation]] were acknowledged and confirmed by this non-partisan report.&lt;ref name="USCIRF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/nov/02aziz.htm |title=Bangladesh slammed for persecution of Hindus |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USCIRF2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/publications/policyfocus/BangladeshPolicyBrief.pdf|title=Original USCIRF Report, United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|publisher=Uscirf.gov|accessdate=2013-10-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928023842/http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/publications/policyfocus/BangladeshPolicyBrief.pdf|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 2006, USCIRF criticized Bangladesh for continuing persecution of minority Hindus. It also urged the [[George Walker Bush|Bush]] administration to get Dhaka to ensure protection of religious freedom and minority rights before Bangladesh's next national elections in January 2007.&lt;ref name="USCIRF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USCIRF2"/&gt;

In 2013, the [[International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)|International Crimes Tribunal]] indicted several Jamaat members for [[war crimes]] against Hindus during the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities]]. In retaliation, [[2013 Bangladesh Anti-Hindu violence|violence against Hindu minorities]] in Bangladesh was instigated by the [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami]]. The violence included the looting of Hindu properties and businesses, the burning of Hindu shops and homes, rape and abductions of Hindu women and vandalising and desecrating the [[Hindu temple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh: Wave of violent attacks against Hindu minority|url=http://amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/bangladesh-wave-violent-attacks-against-hindu-minority-2013-03-06#.UTeKDSrYyD8.twitter|work=Press releases|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political representation===
Even after the decline of Hindu population in Bangladesh from 13.5% in 1974, just after the independence, Hindus were at around 9.2% of the population in 2001 according to government estimates following the census. However, Hindus accounted for only four members of the 300 member parliament following the 2001 elections through direct election; this went up to five following a by-election victory in 2004. Significantly, of the 50 seats reserved for women that are directly nominated by the Prime Minister, not a single one was allotted to a Hindu. The political representation is not at all satisfactory and several Hindu advocacy groups in Bangladesh have demanded a return to a communal electorate system as existed during the Pakistan period, to enable a more equitable and proportionate representation in parliament, or a reserved quota since persecution of Hindus has continued since 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://noakhalinoakhali.webs.com/ |title=Home - Noakhali Noakhali |publisher=Noakhalinoakhali.webs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411092703/http://noakhalinoakhali.webs.com/ |archivedate=11 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persecution by Muslims==
In response to the [[2013 Sana'a attack]], a Yemeni woman from [[Bajil District|Bajil]] in [[Al Hudaydah Governorate|Hudaydah]] declared converting from Islam to Christianity and immediately, the government put her under investigations, after a chance timeout, sent her to a [[psychiatric hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiosawa.com/content/Yemeni-girl-convert-into-Christianity-/241985.html The Yemeni government puts Fatima Al Salem in a psychiatric hospital after converting Christianity] - Radio Sawa (Arabic article, [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ar&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.radiosawa.com%2Fcontent%2FYemeni-girl-convert-into-Christianity-%2F241985.html&amp;edit-text= Google translation])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sedevacantisme.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/fatima-mohammed-al-salem-convertie-au-christ-et-persecutee-pour-lui/|title=Fatima Mohammed al-Salem convertie au Christ et persécutée pour Lui|first=|last=sedevacantisme|date=15 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2013, a new page was founded on the [[Facebook]] and encouraging non-religious Yemenis to show up and not to get afraid of the wild community reaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/IrreligiousYemenis IrreligiousYemenis]- a social page for the non-religion followers of Yemeni community&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been also a broad misconception between [[secularism]] and atheism or even being non religious, many activists were kidnapped due to that confusion, examples of those events
* On 4 September 2015 a secular activist named Anwar Al-Wazir was kidnapped in [[Taiz]] in front of his family for being secular.&lt;ref name="almashhad-alyemeni.com"&gt;[http://www.almashhad-alyemeni.com/art25808.html Killing Anwar Alwazir in front of his kids (Arabic)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="almashhad-alyemeni.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://alwasat-ye.net/?ac=3&amp;no=44233 Who Killed Anwar Alwazir (Arabic)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* On 26 April 2016 a 17 year old activist named Omar Bataweel was accused for atheism and killed in [[Aden]]. One of his famous quotes was "They accuse me of atheism! Oh you people, I see God in the flowers, and you see Him in the graveyards, that is the difference between me and you".&lt;ref&gt;[https://stateofmind13.com/2016/04/27/omar-mohammad-the-17-year-old-martyr-of-arab-free-thought-and-speech/  Omar Mohammad: The 17 Year Old Martyr Of Arab Free Thought and Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://al-bab.com/blog/2016/04/yemeni-accused-atheism-murdered Yemeni accused of atheism is murdered]&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of '''Israeli printmaking''' can be found in the [[Hebrew]]-[[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] [[printing|print]] from the second half of the 19th century. The field includes the use of various print techniques such as [[woodcut]], [[etching]], [[Lithography]] and more. At the same time, the development of the artistic print in the Land of Israel and later in the State of [[Israel]] cannot be translated into a continuum of development, but rather a tradition of mutual influences along with expressions of disconnect and disregard caused by various artistic influences and by the development of technological means. 

==The beginning of printing in Palestine== 
[[file:Olitzky 02.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|''Seder Avodat Hakodes'' title page, woodcut, printed by [[Israel Back]].]]
The beginning of the modern printing industry in Israel can be found in the second half of the 19th century, when a number of printing houses were established in [[Jerusalem]]. These printing houses dealt with the printing of texts in which various artistic images were incorporated. The first [[Hebrew]] printing house was established by [[Israel Back]] (Baal Koreh [Hebrew term for Torah Reader]) in [[Safed]] in 1841 and transferred to Jerusalem in 1841. Back worked with presses and tools for casting letters he brought with him from Europe. The first press was a wooden table-shaped press, a heavy metal plate laid on the paper undergoing the printing operation.&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph Olitzky, The Art of Printing, (Hadera: Museum of Printing Art and Hadera Paper, 1973), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842, Israel Back received the printing presses nicknamed "Massat Moshe and Yehudit" (he: משאת משה ויהודית) from [[Moses Montefiore]]. Its area of print was 85 cm long and 57&amp;nbsp;cm wide.&lt;ref&gt;This press, known as the "Moses and Yehudit", was sold with the closure of the printing house by the son of Israel Beck to the "Zuckerman Printing Press" (see, Joseph Olitzky, The Art of Printing, p. 37, 53-54). From a more recent perspective, the press was transferred to the Levin-Epstein Press. Today the press is located at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya&lt;/ref&gt; The first book printed by Back in Jerusalem was "Seder Avodat Hakodes" (he: סדר עבודת הקודש) by [[Chaim Yosef David Azulai]].[3] His title page is decorated with a hybrid model created using a [[wood engraving]] technique. In the center of the description is an image of a two-column gate in the [[Ionic order]], bearing a decorative [[frieze]] with an [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaf. Around the gate, Beck created an ornamental frame with vegetal patterns.&lt;ref&gt;See Yona Fischer, ed., Art and Craft in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum,1979), p. 188-189.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Christian printing houses such as the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Armenian]] St. James Printing House, founded in 1833; the [[Custody of the Holy Land|Franciscan]] printing house, which began in 1846 under the direction of [[Sebastian Pratschner]]; the printing house of [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate]], which was founded in 1853 and another printing house, established in 1885 at the [[Schneller Orphanage]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gil Gordon, "'The best one in the Black Art: The Print-shop of Schneller's German Protestant Mission in Palestine in the late Ottoman Period'," Cathedra 138 (2010):  83-110. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The main concern of printing houses was the printing of texts using [[Letterpress printing]]. However, in the process of printing, various illustrations were sometimes included. These illustrations were created using woodcut, wood engraving or metal engraving techniques and were limited by the size the print. Most of the decorations were assigned to the title page of the book. This page usually consisted of a decorative frame created from a print or image of the [[Holy Land]]. In addition, the printing houses created a variety of printed items such as decorated certificates, "Mizrachs" [ornamental or sacred pictures hung on the east wall of a house or synagogue in the direction of Jerusalem], etc. The printing houses themselves created some of the printing blocks, while others were commissioned by independent trainers. [[Abraham Leib Monzon]], for example, created some of the printing blocks for his printing house, while others were created by artists like [[Meir Rozin]]. On the "Shiviti" plate, for example, created by [[Shimon Israel Shane]], three printing blocks (printing plates) that contain descriptions of the [[Western Wall]], [[Rachel's Tomb]] and the tombs of the kings of the House of David, with hand-painted and hand-stamped seals, were added.&lt;ref&gt;See Yona Fischer, ed., Art and Craft in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum,1979), p. 49-51.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, these illustrations were reused for various printed materials and even passed between different printing houses.&lt;ref&gt;See Yona Fischer, ed., Art and Craft in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum,1979), p.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the technique of lithograph printing was at the ''Salomon Printing House'' (he: דפוס סלומון), founded by [[Yoel Moshe Salomon]] and [[Michal HaCohen]], who learned the technique in [[Königsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Inspiration and Implementation: The Story of the Salomon (Zoref) Family (Jerusalem: The Ari Synagogue, 2011), p. 10- 11.&lt;/ref&gt; During their studies there HaCohen and Solomon printed a pamphlet entitled "Altar Stones," in which they detailed the process of creating a lithographic print.&lt;ref&gt;See Shoshana Halevi, The Beginning of Hebrew Printing in Eretz Israel, on the website Daat (http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/mahanaim/halevi-1.htm) (first published in Mahanayim, 1966), p. 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Their decision to import the technique to Israel probably stemmed from their desire to serve as an alternative to the printing house of Back, which for 20 years had held a monopoly in the field of Jewish printmaking. One of the first works printed by the new printing house was "Shoshanta" (1862), the name for a local version of a decorative ornament drawn from European traditions. Along with the descriptions, there were also photographs of places such as the [[Tomb of Absalom]], [[Tower of David]], the Western Wall, etc. 

Another printing press that was known for its artistic works was ''A.L. Monsohn Printing House'' (he: דפוס א.ל. מונזון), which began operations in 1892. The printing house began operating with a hand press and in 1894 brought an automatic machine from Europe that could produce about 1,000 pages per hour.[10] A major part of the work of this printing press was the use of the [[lithograph]] printing technique. Among other things, it created prints of up to half a sheet (50x70 cm),&lt;ref&gt;See: A.L. Monsohn Lithographic Press,1892-1992, (Jerusalem: The Ari Synagogue, 2009), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; from the works of artists such as Rozin, Moshe Ben Yitzhak Mizrachi, and others, who also began to make use of photographs created using the lithographic technique,&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., 100 Years of Printing in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs were converted to lithographs in a process that included the use of the technique of etching and transfer paper ([[Decalcomania]]).

== 1900–1950, From Europe to Eretz Israel: the Beginning of the Modern Artistic Print==
[[File:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 1999 98 0.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait of [[Theodor Herzel]] (1903) by [[Hermann Struck]]. Etching and soft-ground]]

While the people of the '[[Old Yishuv]]' perceived art as a religious art that served the [[liturgy]], at the beginning of the 20th century, art became more prevalent in modern Hebrew culture. Expressions of Judaism also began to gain national significance, following the expansion of the [[Zionist movement]] in Europe. The artists who came from Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, already experienced artists with a standing in the print industry, contributed most to the development of this medium in the Eretz Israel. Another central milestone in the development of this concept is the establishment of the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Bezalel Academy of Arts and Crafts]] in Jerusalem in 1906.

===Hermann Struck and his successors===

The most prominent Jewish artist in the European printing industry was [[Hermann Struck]], who was associated with many Expressionist artists, was even a member of the [[Vienna Secession|Sezessionstil]] in Berlin, and exhibited consistently until 1913. Along with landscapes, Struck created portraits and genre descriptions of Jewish life, particularly in Eastern Europe. He did this in a variety of print techniques such as lithograph and etching. Over the years he published several files of prints as a book, but Struck's most famous and successful book was ''Die Kunst des Radierens'' (The Art of Etching), published in Berlin in 1908 by [[Paul Kasirer]]. The book described the process of printing etchings, interspersed with illustrations by Struck. Because of the popularity of the book, which appealed to both artists and to the public as a whole, it was printed in four additional editions between 1912 and 1923. The book established Struck's fame as a leading artist in the print industry.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

[[Jacob Steinhardt]] and [[Joseph Budko]], who studied print with Struck, also dealt often with themes from the [[Shtetl]], not only as an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] depiction, as Struck did, but also as a spiritual expression. Part of the change stemmed from the influence of expressionism on these artists. For Steinhardt, for example, this effect was expressed in a theatrical atmosphere rich in pathos and grotesque expressions.&lt;ref&gt;See One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1907 and 1935, Steinhardt created about 250 etchings, but in Palestine he began to work in the [[wood cut]] ,combining [[Wood engraving]] parts, both because of his inability to produce these etchings and as an expression of the influence of the light in Palestine, which he expresses in the contrasting blacks and whites characteristic of this medium.&lt;ref&gt;See: Amishai-Meisels, Ziva, Jacob Steinhardt: Etchings and Lithographs, (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1981), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with their independent works, the two also created [[Illustration]]s in various print techniques for various Hebrew publications that were published in Europe at the time. Among these are the woodcuts that Steinhardt created for the [[Book of Jonah]] (1924) and the [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]] (Berlin: Ferdinand Auster, 1923), accompanied by a calligraphic text created by [[Franzisca Baruch]], and the lithographs created by Budko for [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]]’s And the Crooked Shall Be Made Straight (1919), as well as his prints for the 50th edition (Berlin: Hovevei Ha-Shir Ha-Ivrit, 1923) of the writings of [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}

[[File:A.0064-2 size.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bezalel Jerusalem, Lithographical Establishment, Photograph by [[Ya'acov Ben-Dov]]. Jerusalem Print Workshop collection]]
With the establishment of the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Bezalel Academy of Arts and Crafts]], [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]], one of the leading illustrators in Europe, arrived in Jerusalem. His artistic style derived from the European "[[Jugendstil]]" and his work expressed the main Zionist national outlook at the time. Lilien was also in the habit of taking photographs from which he would create his drawings and prints. Despite the fact that he lived only a short time in Jerusalem, his style influenced Bezalel's main style of design.

In 1909, a lithography department was opened at Bezalel, headed by [[Avraham Gershowitz]] (Gershuni). This department printed a limited number of artistic works, mainly by artists such as [[Shmuel Ben-David]] and [[Jacob Stark|Ya’akov (Jacob) Stark]]. However, the print quality was poor and was not suitable for producing large editions, mainly due to the technical equipment. [[Boris Schatz]] himself testified in 1917 that the school had equipment to "make experimental leaves," but that "we do not have a printing machine."&lt;ref&gt;Boris Schatz, "A Proposal to Strengthen and Distribute Craftsmanship in Jerusalem and Eretz-Israel in General," in Shilo-Cohen, Nurit, Schatz's Bezalel, (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1982), p.178.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the artistic endeavors, the department also did commercial work such as printing textbooks and other materials, such as lottery cards designed by Shmuel Haruvi.&lt;ref&gt;See: One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p. 13-15; Also: Gideon Ofrat, "Comment on the Beginning of Lithography in Eretz Israel," on the website "Gideon Ofrat’s Warehouse" ( https://gideonofrat.wordpress.com/), 7 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the lithographic work at Bezalel included realistic prints of portraits and genre descriptions, as well as a few commercial works.

In 1919 [[Israel Hirshfeld]], a student of Bezalel (1915–1917), was sent to Vienna in order to learn professionally the art of lithograph printing. Throughout his stay there, he exchanged letters with Bezalel teachers like [[Abel Penn]], Schatz, and others who asked him to purchase a press and lithographic equipment for Bezalel, despite the fact that they did not send money to him.&lt;ref&gt;His letters are in the custody of his daughters in Jerusalem. Copies of them are in the Information Center for Israeli Art. A small notebook with documentation of his studies in Vienna was donated by his daughters to the Jerusalem Print Workshop.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 Penn himself went to Vienna and purchased a press and accompanying equipment.[17]See Yigal Zalmona, The Art of Abel Pann- From Montparnasse to the Land of the Bible, (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2003), p. XIV-XV.&lt;/ref&gt; On this press, Penn printed the series of illustrations for the Bible he created. There is however some disagreement with regard to the printing technique of these works. While Penn declared he used lithographic printing, others declared that it was a type of offset, claiming that Jerusalem presses were unsuitable for use as a basis for lithographic printing.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, "Comment on the Beginnings of Offset Printing in Eretz Israel," retrieved from Gideon Ofrat’s Storeroom, http://gideonofrat.wordpress.com/, 7 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Bezalel, in 1923 [[Ze'ev Raban]] and [[Meir Gur Arie]] established a company called "Industrial Art Studio" (he: בית עבודה לעבודות אינדוסטריאליות), within which "Graphica Press" was created, and which printed posters of a limited size and various prints in the Jugendstil style.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, "Lilien and the Tradition of the Jugendstil in ‘Bezalel’", in: On the Land: Eretz-Israel Art: Pirkei Avot, pp. 211-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Another artist who worked in the field independently was [[Jacob Eisenberg]], who printed etchings in a workshop he set up in his home in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), pp. 14-15, in particular pp. 208-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, the influence of modernist art was evident among some Bezalel students who continued their studies in Europe or were exposed to contemporary art. These were works that established an artistic opposition to the school that expressed the spirit of the period of the Tower of David. Artists such as [[Nachum Gutman]], [[Israel Paldi]] and others created expressive etchings and, particularly, woodcuts. Among these works is a series of prints called "The God Seekers" (1923; he: מבקשי אלוהים), created by [[Reuven Rubin]], and the series of prints "Jaffa" (1925) by Israel Paldi. Late recognition was given to the series "Gray Tura" (1924; he: טורא אפורה) created by [[Arieh Allweil]] in Europe, which was displayed in Israel only in the 1990s.

==1930–1950: From the Consolidation of the Nation to the consolidation of Self==
[[File:Taamon 1940's.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Miron Sima]], [[Yehuda Wolpert]], [[Isidore Aschheim]], [[Jacob Pines]], [[Yossi Stern]] and [[Mordecai Ardon]] at Cafe Ta'mon, Jerusalem, 1940s]]
In the 1930s, the printing industry began to take on greater importance in the field of Eretz Israeli art. The development of the field was closely linked to the [[Fifth Aliyah]], in which many artists came to Eretz Israel and Jerusalem. These artists, persecuted by their countries of origin in Germany and Austria, sought to continue the spirit of European modernism in general and the heritage of German art movements such as Bauhaus and Expressionism in particular.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, The New Bezalel: The Bezalel Academy of Art and Design (Jerusalem, 1987), p. 26; also: Yigal Zalmona, 100 Years of Israeli Art, Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2015), p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the art of the time reflected in many ways the construction of Zionist national consciousness. An example of this can be found in stamps issued by the [[Jewish National Fund]], quoting images drawn from artists such as Struck, Lilien, Budko, Steinhardt, and others, who reflected the worldview of the creators of the artistic print, and whose images could at that time easily pass from private to nationalistic art.&lt;ref&gt;See: We Shall not Forget You, Exile (Jerusalem, Jewish National Fund, 1945).&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of the Tel Aviv Museum, in 1934, was accompanied by the dedication of one of the two halls of [[Tel Aviv Museum]] to works in the various print fields.&lt;ref&gt;See: "Etchings Exhibitions," Doar Hayom [Post Office Today], 28 January 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of the growing importance of the field can be found in an article published on 20 October 1935, in [[Haaretz]], entitled "The Question of Hebrew Graphics"&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, The New Bezalel: The Bezalel Academy of Art and Design (Jerusalem, 1987), p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; and the printing of a [[Dictionary]] of Graphic Arts published by [[Mordecai Narkis]] in 1937 by the [[Bialik Institute]] and the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language|Hebrew Language Committee]]. The publication of the dictionary reflected the activities of The [[Bezalel National Museum]] in the 1920s and 1930s and the need to create uniform and clear terms for the various print terms. The dictionary of Narkis, dedicated to Hermann Struck on the occasion of his 60th birthday, was based on the German language, whose terms are "most common among the graphic artists living in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Narkis, Dictionary of Graphic Terms, (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute Publishing, 1937, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of these documents reveals that the term "graphics" included both the artistic print and the graphic design field. This mixture would remain a guiding principle in the school of "New Bezalel School for Arts and Crafts" which was opened in 1935 in Jerusalem. The curriculum of the school aspired to raise the artistic level of design in Israel, while providing practical opportunities for students to earn a living. This practical approach demonstrated the fact that Hebrew industry (and, to some extent, the Hebrew city) also began to serve as another legitimate expression of Zionist activity. Therefore, the school, whose first director was Budko, did not open an art track, but rather a track for practical graphics, which was headed by [[Rudi Deutsch]] (Dayan). The department dealt mainly with lithograph printing, which was the most popular commercial technique at the time.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, The New Bezalel: The Bezalel Academy of Art and Design (Jerusalem, 1987), p. 72-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacob Steinhardt]], who immigrated to Eretz Israel in 1933 opened, in what had been the home of Boris Schatz, a painting and printing studio that was a kind of opposition to the "New Bezalel", which was directed by Yosef Budko. After Budko's death in 1940, Steinhardt joined Bezalel's staff and became director of the school's graphics department. During this period, the importance of classical printing techniques, lithography, woodcutting, and engraving as a commercial printing technique became less important, eclipsed by offset printing. However, these techniques were revived through art classes at the school.

During the 1940s a small community of artists, who engaged in graphic techniques, including artistic prints of various kinds, was established around the "New Bezalel." A comprehensive view of their works shows the strong influence of German culture on everything connected to the cultural tradition (Bildung). In the prints of these artists, such as [[Miron Sima]], [[Isidor Aschheim]], and Jakob Eisenscher, as well as in the works of artists who worked independently of this group, such as [[Arieh Allweil]], [[Paul Conrad Henich]], [[Abraham Goldberg]], [[Leo Roth]] and others, we see an attempt to combine European style with characteristics of the local Eretz Israeli reality and Zionist motifs and themes. This was often accompanied by the adoption of biographical-psychological features, which were largely missing in the works of historic Bezalel's artists.

==1950–1970: The print in the State of Israel==
[[File:Pins - Woodcuts for Heinrich von Kleist’s Michael Kohlhaas 07.jpg|thumb|right|250px|From Woodcuts for Heinrich von Kleist’s Michael Kohlhaas (1953 / 2003} by [[Jacob Pins]]. Woodcut, Printed by the Jerusalem Print Workshop]]

The establishment of the State of [[Israel]] in 1948 does not constitute a significant historical point in the history of [[Israeli art]], apart from several expressions of nationalism and the development of iconography around the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. However, the opening of [[Mandatory Palestine]] to Jewish immigration led to a large population that began to be educated according to the tradition of the young field of the Israeli print, led in these years by Jacob Steinhardt in the new Bezalel. Many of the youngsters who came to Eretz Israel after the Holocaust either under the auspices of Youth Aliyah, or with their families, such as [[Jacob Pins]], [[Avraham Ofek]], [[Avigdor Arikha]], [[Yehuda Bacon]], [[Moshe Hoffman]], among others, became prominent Israeli artists in the 1950s and 1960s.

Apart from the technique of the woodcut, that could be studied at Bezalel, there were not many places that trained artists in the various print techniques. In [[Ein Hod]] and Jerusalem, [[Rudi Lehman]] taught the art of the wood cut and sculpture. A large group of artists were influenced by his approach to art, that combined animal images in a "primitive" style with a modernist ethos of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel C p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; This group included artists such as [[Shoshana Heimann]], [[Raya Bar Ado]]n and others.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Some training in the technique of lithograph printing was provided by Cohen, who operated the Hebrew University Press in Jerusalem. Most of the artists printed their works in his studio, or with local artists, such as [[David Ben Shaul]], who had specialized in lithograph printing in Paris. Upon his return to Israel in 1963, he brought a lithographic press and printed works for various artists in his studio in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;See: Arik Kilmanik, "Setting Up a Print Workshop", in: The Printer’s Imprint: Twenty Years of the Jerusalem Print Workshop (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1994), p. 9; also: "A Conversation with Arik Kilmanik", in: Prints from the Collection of the Jerusalem Print Workshop (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 1984), p. 4 (no page numbers).&lt;/ref&gt;

Basing themselves on the local tradition and ethos of Paris as the capital of world art,&lt;ref&gt;See: Benjamin Tammuz, "They Returned from Paris," Ha'aretz, 17 December 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; many artists continued to travel to pursue art studies in France and Europe, unaware of the change in the world art scene and the development of the United States as an art center.&lt;ref&gt;While in the United States offset printing in the 1950s and 1960s became the main printing technique, the use of this technique in industry began only in the late 1950s. According to Eric Kilmanik, one of the first to engage in non- industrial printing was the daughter or granddaughter of Martin Buber, who set up an offset printing workshop in her home, where Kilmanik created a poster for a folk dance evening at the Bezalel Student Union.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryeh Rothman]], for example, went to study at the [[Académie Julian]] in 1959, and later studied in Paris at the [[Johnny Friedlaender]] engraving workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Angel, "The Engravings of Johnny Friedlander," Maariv, 28 May 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tuvia Beeri]] studied at the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] (1963–1961), and continued his specialization in Friedlaender's engraving workshop. [[Milka Cizik]], however, went to study in [[East Germany]] (1965–1961), where she studied various printing techniques at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]].

The French and German influences led to the adoption of modernist techniques,&lt;ref&gt;Newer techniques, which would come to be identified with postmodernism, began to enter the industry in Israel in the late 1950s. In Israel, for example, a silk printing was used. See: "Institute for the Preparation of Professional Study Materials is Established,"Sha’arim, 24 December 1956; And also: "The World of Printing," Davar, 24 September 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; such as Aryeh Rothman's use of the photographic technique of [[Heliograveur]]&lt;ref&gt;The Heliograveur is a form of photogravure that dates back to the 19th century and is used to reproduce photographs.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "invention" by others of various artistic techniques (in the spirit of late [[Surrealism]]). [[Miron Sima]], for example, added to his woodcuts, such as "The Bride", textures printed from fabrics and chains, which sought to enrich the texture of the print, and to deepen its realism. In addition, the shortage of materials available in Israel led many artists to use other techniques that were available to them, such as [[Linocut]], as a substitute for [[wood cut]]. Even Rudi Lehmann, despite his strong connection to artistic tradition, experimented with the use of new materials. He was one of the first artists to create woodcuts on [[plywood]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel C p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic print field to which these students were exposed upon their return to Israel was very limited. Not only were there no places to print editions of artistic prints, it was also considered a secondary art. In the 1960 album ''Graphic Art in Israel'', [[Eugen Kolb]] wrote that "exhibitions of graphics only are considered (unfairly!) for less important exhibits."&lt;ref&gt;Zvi Zohar and Eugen Kolb, The Israeli Graphic, (Ha-Kibbutz Artzi, Merhavia: Sifriat Poalim, 1960), p. 9. Another textual review of the Israeli print and drawing artists appeared in the book The Art of Israel (Jerusalem: Massada, 1963) by Benjamin Tammuz.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisheva Cohen]], curator of the Department of Prints and Drawings at the [[Bezalel National Museum]] and at the [[Israel Museum]], had to publish the booklet T''he Print: What Is It?'' (1965),&lt;ref&gt;What is a Print? (Jerusalem:The Israel Museum,1965).&lt;/ref&gt; in order to expose the field to visitors to the museum. Therefore, it is no wonder that in the annual general exhibition of the ''Israel Painters and Sculptors Association'' of 1963, for example, only 7 artistic prints were displayed out of 375 works.&lt;ref&gt;Among the exhibitors were Hedwig Grossman (1), Hanna Pfizer (1), Jacob Pins (2), Arieh Rothman (2) and Shoshana Resnick (1). See: General Exhibition of Israeli Artists 1963 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Also at the exhibition ''Tazpit'' 1964, which was perceived as more artistic at the time, Tuvia Beeri was the only artist among more than 30 artists who exhibited prints.&lt;ref&gt;See: Tatspit [Observation Point] (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1964). Tazpit - an acronym for an Israeli painting and sculpture exhibition - was an exhibition organized by a group of artists who wanted to create an exhibition of  young art that was free of institutional pressures. In this exhibition, artists who chose to work in the area of prints in those years, such as Yigal Tumarkin and Uri Lifshitz, participated, but the exhibition chose to present works in a more avant-garde style: On the subject of this exhibition, see: Galia BarOr and Hayuta Bahat: Paintings (Ein Harod: Museum of Art, 2013), pp. 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at the same time the print was perceived in various circles as an expression of "good taste." An example of this can be found in the publications of [[Moshe Spitzer]], who commissioned illustrations for publications by Tarshish Publishing House that were done using various print techniques. Among these works are [[Avigdor Luisada]]'s woodcuts for [[Yitzhak Shenhar]]’s ''Between Star and Grass'' (1942) and the engravings of [[Avigdor Arikha]] for ''A Stray Dog'' (1958) and the woodcuts created by [[Jacob Pines]] for the book [[Michael Kohlhaas]] (1953).&lt;ref&gt;However, the latter two were not printed directly from the printing board, but were transferred to print using a photographic method, which was more suitable for larger editions. See: Ada Vardi, Spitzer: Chapters and Tarshish (Tel Aviv: Tarshish Publishing, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the printing workshop of the Artists House Tel Aviv opened under the auspices of the Israel Painters and Sculptors Association and was managed by Tuvia Beeri. The workshop gave artists for the first time a place of work to create works using engraving techniques. At the same time, Beeri opened another workshop at the [[Avni Institute of Art and Design|Avni Institute]].

==1970-1990: Between avant-garde and institutionalization ==

During the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]], the printing industry underwent a period of unprecedented development in Israel. A variety of print workshops made it possible for artists to create works using various techniques in this medium. A number of artists began to work in prints and in preparing printing plates for other artists in their studio. Moshe Givati established a printing workshop in Haifa that dealt mainly with screen printing technique.&lt;ref&gt;Between 1970 and 1971, Givati worked at a silk-printing workshop at his studio in Haifa, where he created works in the wake of Yitzhak Danziger's "Nesher Quarry" project. In addition, he printed works for artists such as Michael Gross, Shmuel Katz, Zvi Mairovitch and others. From 1974 to 1982 he lived in New York, where he made a living by working in real estate, alongside his work as an artist in a workshop he opened with Arieh Moscovitch.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Ben Shaul|David (Dedi) Ben Shaul]], printed using lithograph technique, and [[Avishai Eyal]], who worked primarily in the medium of etching, set up a separate studio in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Eyal was mainly engaged in experimental printing and in printing prints in small editions. See: Sanford Sivits Shaiman, Prints from the Avishay Ayal Etching workshop 1972-1975 (Haifa: University of Haifa, 1990); Gideon Ophrat, 100 Years of Print Art in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the establishment of the large workshops made the independent activities of these artists somewhat redundant.  Itche Mambush founded another workshop in the 1960s in Ein Hod, directed by [[Ora Lahav Shaltiel]]. In 1972 [[Jacob Harel]] founded a commercial print workshop that would become Har-el Printers and Publishers. In 1974 the [[Jerusalem Print Workshop]] was established in Jerusalem. The workshop was established as a public benefit company and was initially associated with the [[Jerusalem Artists Association]]. In 1975, the [[Israel Museum]] set up another public print workshop - the Burston Graphics Center - in [[Hutzot Hayotzer]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Meira Perry-Lehman, Curator, Israeli prints from the Burston Gallery, (Jerusalem:The Israel Museum, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several other printing houses published in the field of  artistic printing.&lt;ref&gt;See: Rachel Angel, "The Register - in Seventy Languages," Maariv, 16 January 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the rising popularity of the medium could be found in the activity of the Israeli Graphotek, which in [[1978]] had not yet opened its doors to the public, but had already collected about 1300 works by 105 different artists.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Angel, "The Israeli Graphotec," Maariv, 2 March 1979&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[1990s]], Graphotek had already collected about 4,000 works by about 200 artists and was accessible to the public in six centers around the country.&lt;ref&gt;See: The Graphotec Notebook, Alima File (Jerusalem: The Information Center for Israeli Art, The Israel Museum).&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1975 list, [[Adam Baruch]] described the growing popularity of artistic prints during those years in Israel and around the world. Baruch distinguished between the reproduction of old works to the medium of the print, and works of art that made critical use of the various techniques of the medium.&lt;ref&gt;See: Adam Baruch, "The Israeli Print (Cut)" Musag [Concept], Issue No. 5, (October 1975), p 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, attempts were made to mount systematic displays of prints. In 1978, the exhibition "30 Israeli Artists: Artistic Prints" was presented at [[Tel Aviv University]],&lt;ref&gt;See: Talia Rappaport, "50 years of prints," Davar, 23 June 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1980s, attempts were made to establish a triennale for graphics at the Haifa Museum of Art. 

Many artists adopted the medium as another technique in their work, a technique of a more commercial nature. Usually prints were produced in editions of between 30 to 150 copies.&lt;ref&gt;The number of copies of the edition is dependent on technique. Silk prints or lithographs were printed in large editions. In some cases, about 250-300 copies were printed.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the works were intended for the international market, especially for the United States. In addition, various albums were also produced that combined 5-10 works by a single artist&lt;ref&gt;Igael Tumarkin , for example, who has created over 300 different prints, published several bound albums, including "Paraphrases on the Polyhedron" (1972), " Self Portrait 1975 " (1975) and " Battle of the Blind Men and the Sow- Heinrich von Kleist "(1979).&lt;/ref&gt; or by a group of artists.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Print Workshop , for example, printed in 1977 an album entitled "Jerusalem", with the prints of five artists ( Michael Gross ,Liliane Klapisch , Moshe Kupferman , Ivan Schwebel and Menashe Kadishman ), in an edition of 200 copies.&lt;/ref&gt; This commercial development led several galleries to continuously produce series of prints for artists, which were printed in the various workshops. The major ones included the Bineth Gallery in Tel Aviv&lt;ref&gt;Produced prints for artists such as Lillian Clapisch , Fima and others&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Engel Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;Produced prints for artists such as Moshe Castel and Anna Ticho and others&lt;/ref&gt; in Jerusalem. The popularity of the print also led to the printing of signed and numbered posters by artists or the production of prints based on the works of deceased artists, by inscribing their signature on the plate.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gad Ullman, "Gray Market Prints: Original Prints, Reproduction, and Everything in-between", Studio, Art Magazine, Issue No. 12 (June 1990), pp 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Unlike most of the artists who worked in the field, in the 1970s and 1980s, a group of artists continued their avant-garde activities concerning everything related to the examination of the artistic object, including in the medium of print. Artists such as [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Michael Gitlin]], [[Benni Efrat]], and others emphasized the plastic nature of the paper by using various artistic means such as repetition and seriality, or by emphasizing the print plate as an object, or by folding and distorting the paper. [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]], for example, made use of plates printed on entire sheets of paper in [[1980]], leaving him with negatives. In the works of [[Menashe Kadishman]] (1983), the artist reconstructed his sculptural activities and converted them into the print media, creating a confrontation between nature and culture.&lt;ref&gt;See: Mordechai Omer, Tikkun (Tel Aviv: The Genia Schreiber University Art Gallery,1998), p 182. Also: Gideon Ofrat, 100 Years of Printmaking in Israel , Jerusalem Print Workshop, Jerusalem, 2015 , pp. 187-186.&lt;/ref&gt; A unique preoccupation with the surface of the print is also found in the works of [[Joyce Schmidt]], who created prints using techniques of stress. Her paper-making business led her to make use of the paper produced by the business. 

From a technical point of view, the flourishing of lithography technique particularly stands out during this period. The main development of the technique in Israel during this period can be credited to the work of the Burston Graphic Center, which in its first year trained artists in this technique. [[Alima]], who studied this technique at Burston, imported this printing technique to the print workshop at the Artists House in Tel Aviv and the College of Visual Arts in Beersheva. In her independent work she combined the technique of lithography with other techniques such as screen printing and etching. To a great extent, this technique died out in the early 1990s, with the closure of the Burston Center. 

In contrast to the lithography and etching techniques, the screen printing technique (or "silkscreen printing" as it was called at the time) was perceived as a secondary technique, mainly because it lacked any artistic tradition. Art in Israel began using industrial techniques in the late 1950s, but until the 1970s it was not widely used in art. As early as 1949, [[Ellie Gross]] (Yaari) lectured on serigraphy (screen printing) in the exhibition "What is Graphics?" In the Jerusalem Artists House. However, an early example of artistic use of the medium can be found in the book The Jerusalem Hills and all the Anguish (1967) by Malachi Beit-Arie published by Tarshish. The book was accompanied by screen prints created by Myriam Bat-Yosef and printed in a commercial printing press - "Herut Herut Printing Press".&lt;ref&gt;Ada Vardi, Spitzer: Chapters and Tarshish (Tel Aviv: Tarshish Publishing, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant development in the use of art technique can be attributed to [[Zvi Tolkovsky]], who returned from art studies in the United States and learned the technique there. At the end of the sixties,Tolkovsky returned to Israel and, in 1969-1969, a workshop for printing and screen printing at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]].&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted that despite the influence of American art, the photograph was not perceived at the time as an independent artistic object, but mainly used as documentation of artistic activity.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkovsky also taught at the Artists House in Tel Aviv, where screen printing was used as part of a variety of techniques such as calligraphy. An expression of the ambivalent status of the screen print can be found in the work of [[Moshe Gershuni]], who was commissioned to create a series of print works at the Jerusalem Print Workshop in 1984.  Gershuni testified that he had a distaste for the print medium, "especially for screen printing, which in my opinion represented the most extreme form of graphic art."&lt;ref&gt;Larry Abramson,, "A Conversation with Gershuni, " in Gershuni in the Jerusalem Print Workshop (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 1984, unnumbered pages.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his works in this technique, including "Avinu Malkeinu" [Our Father,Our King] (1984), "Justice and Charity" (1984), and others, enjoyed both artistic and commercial success. 

However, the bulk of the prints were done using various etching techniques. These works were figurative in character and expressive in language. The works of artists such as [[Raanan Levy]], [[Ofer Lellouche]], [[Tamara Rickman]], David Ben-Shaul, were drawings, created using traditional techniques as etching and aquatint. In addition, there were also artists who incorporated new techniques in their works, such as [[Uri Lifschitz]], who combined in works such as "Mr. Rabinovich" (1968), etching with photographic etching. [[Yigal Tumarkin]], for example, in the print "Pieta, Pierre Paolo Pasolini," (1979). 

combined several print plates made using the technique of photographic etching, on which he combined drawing and dry etching.  The plates were combined in a collage, cut and twisted to give them an expressive character and to create negative spaces in the composition. Artists such as [[Ivan Schwebel]], [[Asaph Ben Menachem]] and [[Avraham Eilat]], used this expressionism as an expression of symbolism or metaphysical content. In the famous series "[[Kaddish]]" (1984), for example, Moshe Gershuni created a tangle of symbols and images that expressed a complex position toward Judaism and the Jewish God.

In the early 1990s, "new media art" began to develop, using visual images created by "technical reproduction"&lt;ref&gt;Digital media accompanied by a theoretical study which adopted the essay of Walter Benjamin "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction " (1936-1938) as a fundamental theoretical text.&lt;/ref&gt; without the need to use a manual process of creating print plates and manual printing. The use of computer graphics and digital media, which developed during this period, completely replaced manual design. The use of these methods also led to the perception of the art print industry as archaic. This led to the closure and reduction of many print workshops during the 2000s. Among other things, the workshops of the Faculty of Arts - Hamidrasha at Beit Berl College were closed, and Bezalel's work was greatly reduced. 

The activities of professional workshops were also reduced, and they stopped producing works in large editions and went on to print works in editions of only 12-18 copies. The Burston Center workshop was closed in 1990 after management problems, while the Printmaking Workshop of Tel Aviv Artists House converted its services from printing whole editions to making available the possibility of independent activity and instruction in the use of various techniques. Most of institutionalized artistic activity took place at the Gottesman Etching Center, which was established at Kibbutz Cabri in 1993, at the Har-El Printers &amp; Publishers print workshop in Tel Aviv-Jaffa and at the Jerusalem Print Workshop, which experienced a period of prosperity as a result of the workshop's activity, when it moved to a new business and artistic model in the mid-1980s. 

The shrinking of the field led most of the major artists who worked in the print industry, such as [[Ofer Lellouche]], [[Larry Abramson]], [[Sharon Poliakine]], [[Asaf Ben Zvi]], [[Hila Lulu Lin]] and others, to perceive the medium as secondary in their work. However, artists such as [[Orit Hofshi]], Asaph Ben-Menahem and others have made it the primary medium in their work. 

An area that began to develop during this period is the production of "artists’ books" - books that combined text - mostly poems - with prints created specifically for this book. Such books replaced folders of prints that artists had previously published as a portfolio. The books were printed in limited editions and numbered in etching or screen printing techniques. As early as the 1980s, the Jerusalem Print Workshop began printing such books. Among the best known are Thirteen Etchings for Poems by [[Haim Nachman Bialik]] (1987) by Moshe Gershuni, and in 1989 the workshop created a series of 9 artists’ books in an edition of 40 copies each.&lt;ref&gt;See: Etchings of Songs: Nine Files of Etchings and Poems , on the Jerusalem Print Workshop site.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of producing such books, most of the works were printed for renowned artists.&lt;ref&gt;The works of the artist include Kaddish (Jaffa: Har-El Printers and Publishers, 1997) by Moshe Gershuni , Death Fugue by Paul Celan (Jaffa: Har-El Printers and Publishers, 1995)) by Yigal Tumarkin (and other works he created in this workshop), the folder of prints of Ofer Lellouche from the Gottesman Etching Center, and "TheTrue Rose of Jericho" (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2003) by Larry Abramson .&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Israeli museums continued to purchase prints, exhibitions in major galleries in Tel Aviv-Jaffa or museum exhibitions of Israeli prints were unusual, and even the inclusion of prints in group thematic exhibitions was very small. In 1994, the Israel Museum mounted the exhibition,The Printer's Imprint: Twenty Years with the Jerusalem Print Workshop, Jerusalem, marking the 20th anniversary of the Jerusalem Print Workshop. Among the other museum exhibitions are Portfolios from the Gottesman Etching Center, Kibbutz Cabri (2006) at the Israel Museum, Etchings (2006) at the Negev Museum of Art and Print Time, Works from the Jerusalem Workshop and the Gottesman Center (2013) at the Open Museum, Tefen.

'''Juanita García Peraza''',&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Garcia'''|'''Peraza'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''"Mita"''' (June 24, 1897 – February 21, 1970) was the founder of the "Mita congregation", the only non-Catholic denomination religion of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] origin.

==Early years==

García Peraza was born in [[Hatillo, Puerto Rico]], and raised by her parents, both belonging to wealthy Catholic families that had immigrated to Puerto Rico from the Canary Islands in the 1830s. Her father had previously married one of his cousins, of the prominent García family of the Arecibo, Puerto Rico, region; well-known Puerto Rican writer René Marqués García is one of her nephews. After divorcing his cousin, her father married Peraza's mother, from another Canarian family. When her family moved to their townhouse in Arecibo,  Peraza became extremely ill. She made a promise to Mita [[God]] that if she was cured, she would always serve him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webpub.allegheny.edu/group/LAS/LatinAmIssues/Articles/Vol13/LAI_vol_13_section_I.html Latin American issues Vol. 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717063649/http://webpub.allegheny.edu/group/LAS/LatinAmIssues/Articles/Vol13/LAI_vol_13_section_I.html |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peraza considered it a miracle that she was cured of her illness and she decided to keep her promise. She was one of the first Puerto Rican women to preach religion in Puerto Rico. Soon, she became a leader in the church she attended. This, however, made the majority of the male church members feel uncomfortable with her presence and they told her that she was no longer welcome there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prfrogui.com/geocities/40deld.htm 40 Boricuas of the 20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Mita"==
[[File:Casa de la Diosa Mita.JPG|left|150px|thumb|Peraza's house in Arecibo]]
García Peraza left the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and converted to the protestant religion of the Iglesia de Dios Pentecostal M.I., and then left the church with 11 other members who followed her to start their own religion. In 1940, she and her followers founded their own church in [[Arecibo]], and in 1947 she  relocated to the current location of [[Hato Rey]] a suburb of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. They claimed that "The Holy Spirit Spirit of Life" revealed to García Peraza the new name of "Mita". They started calling themselves "Mitas" and their religion "[[Mita Congregation|the Mita congregation]]".  According to the Mita faith, Mita is the new name of the [[Holy Ghost]] on [[earth]] and Mita [[God]] has chosen a successor before (Peraza)  dies.&lt;ref name="MITA"&gt;[http://www.congregacionmita.org/siguiente_e.htm Congregación Mita] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930210411/http://www.congregacionmita.org/siguiente_e.htm |date=2013-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [Reference book by David Ramos Torres, Historia de la Iglesia de Dios Pentecostal, M.I., Una Iglesia Ungida Para Hacer Mision (1994), page 127, and the other reference book by Jesus Santos Medina, PhD, Veredas Que Confunden, Un Análisis Histórico y Teológico de Sectas Religiosas (2010), pages 14-16.]

Under García Perazas' leadership, the church founded many small businesses which provided work, orientation, and help for its members. The first branch of the church outside of Puerto Rico was established in [[New York City]].  The church has expanded to [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Panama]], [[El Salvador]], [[Canada]], [[Curaçao]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="MITA"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Juanita "Mita" García Peraza died on February 21, 1970 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. [[Teófilo Vargas Sein]] ("Aarón"), was appointed Prophet of God. Puerto Rico honored Juanita García Peraza's memory by naming an [[elementary school]] after her in San Juan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schools.iaf.net/schools_by_city/San%20Juan,PR/1.html San Juan, Puerto Rico Schools, Colleges, Private Schools, K-12]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Kantō Jūhachi Danrin'''''|関東十八檀林||lit. eighteen ''danrin'' temples in the Kantō region}} is generic term for eighteen [[Jōdo-shū]] temples located in [[Kantō region]] that were recognized as {{ill2|Danrin (Buddhism)|ja|檀林|lt=''danrin''|WD=}}{{efn|''Danrin'' is a temple that plays a role as college and institute for the priests in [[Edo period]].

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
[[File:Founding_of_the_Nation_by_Kawamura_Kiyoo.jpg|thumb|The nationalistic essence of ''kokutai'' is thought of as the uniqueness of the Japanese [[polity]] as issuing from a leader of [[Japanese imperial family tree|divine origin]].]]
{{nihongo|'''''Kokutai'''''|国体||"national body/structure of state"}} is a concept in the [[Japanese language]] translatable as "[[system of government]]", "[[sovereignty]]", "national identity, essence and character", "national polity; [[body politic]]; national entity; basis for the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor's]] sovereignty; [[Japanese constitution]]". The word is also a short form of the (unrelated) name for the [[National Sports Festival of Japan]].

==Etymology==
''Kokutai'' originated as a [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese loanword]] from Chinese ''guoti'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|國體}}|p=guótǐ}}; "state political system; national governmental structure"). The Japanese [[Compound (linguistics)|compound word]] joins {{nihongo4||國|koku|"country; nation; province; land"}} and {{nihongo4||體|tai|"body; substance; object; structure; form; style"}}. According to the ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'', the oldest ''guoti'' usages are in two [[Chinese classic texts]]. The 2nd century BCE ''Guliang zhuan'' ({{zh|c=榖梁傳|l=Guliang's Commentary|labels=no}}) to the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] glosses ''dafu'' ({{zh|c=大夫|l=high minister; senior official|labels=no}}) as ''guoti'' metaphorically meaning "embodiment of the country". The 1st century CE [[Book of Han]] history of [[Emperor Cheng of Han]] used ''guoti'' to mean "laws and governance" of Confucianist officials.

==Pre-1868==
The historical origins of ''kokutai'' go back to pre-1868 periods, especially the [[Edo period]] ruled by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1603–1868).

[[Aizawa Seishisai]] (会沢正志斎, 1782–1863) was an authority on [[Neo-Confucianism]] and leader of the [[Mitogaku]] (水戸学 "Mito School") that supported direct restoration of the [[Imperial House of Japan]]. He popularized the word ''kokutai'' in his 1825 ''Shinron'' (新論 "New Theses"), which also introduced the term ''[[Sonnō jōi]]'' ("revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians").

Aizawa developed his ideas of ''kokutai'' using the scholarly arguments of [[Motoori Norinaga]] (1730–1801) that the Japanese national myths in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' were historical facts, believing that the Emperor was directly descended from the sun goddess [[Amaterasu|Amaterasu-ōmikami]]. Aizawa idealized this divinely-ruled ancient Japan as a form of ''saisei itchi'' (祭政一致 "unity of religion and government") or theocracy. For early Japanese Neo-Confucian scholars, linguist [[Roy Andrew Miller]] (1982:93) says, "''kokutai'' meant something still rather vague and ill defined. It was more or less the Japanese "nation's body" or "national structure".

==From 1868 to 1945==

===From 1868 to 1890===
[[Katō Hiroyuki]] (1836–1916) and [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] (1835–1901) were [[Meiji period]] scholars who analyzed the dominance of Western civilization and urged progress for the Japanese nation.

In 1874, Katō wrote the ''Kokutai Shinron'' (国体新論 "New Theory of the National Body/Structure"), which criticized traditional Chinese and Japanese theories of government and, adopting Western theories of [[natural rights]], proposed a [[constitutional monarchy]] for Japan. He contrasted between ''kokutai'' and ''seitai'' (政体 "government body/structure"). Brownlee explains.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Kokutai-seitai'' distinction enabled conservatives to identify clearly as ''Kokutai'', National Essence, the "native Japanese", eternal, and immutable aspects of their polity, derived from history, tradition, and custom, and focused on the Emperor. The form of government, ''Seitai'', a secondary concept, then consisted of the historical arrangements for the exercise of political authority. ''Seitai'', the form of government, was historically contingent and changed through time. Japan had experienced in succession direct rule by the Emperors in ancient times, then the rule of the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] Regents, then seven hundred years of rule by ''[[shōgun]]s'', followed by the allegedly direct rule of the Emperors again after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Each was a ''seitai'', a form of government. In this understanding, the modern system of government under the Meiji Constitution, derived this time from foreign sources, was nothing more than another form of Japanese government, a new ''seitai''. The Constitution was nothing fundamental. (2000:5) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] was an influential author translator for the [[Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860)]]. His 1875 "Bunmeiron no Gairyaku" (文明論の概略 "An Outline of a Theory of Civilization") contradicted traditional ideas about ''kokutai''. He reasoned that it was not unique to Japan and that every nation could be said to have a ''kokutai'' "national sovereignty". While Fukuzawa respected the [[Emperor of Japan]], he believed ''kokutai'' did not depend upon myths of unbroken descent from Amaterasu.

===Meiji Constitution===
The [[Meiji Constitution|Constitution of the Empire of Japan]] of 1889 created a form of constitutional monarchy with the ''kokutai'' sovereign emperor and ''seitai'' organs of government. Article 4 declares that "the Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty", uniting the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, although subject to the "consent of the Imperial Diet". This system utilized a democratic form, but in practice was closer to an absolute monarchy. The legal scholar Josefa López notes that under the Meiji Constitution, ''kokutai'' acquired an additional meaning.
&lt;blockquote&gt; The Government created a whole perfect new cultural system around the Tennou [Emperor], and the ''kokutai'' was the expression of it. Moreover, the ''kokutai'' was the basis of the sovereignty. According to Tatsukichi Minobe, ''kokutai'' is understood as the "shape of the Estate" in the sense of "Tenno as the organ of the Estate", while the authoritarians gave the ''kokutai'' a mystical power. The Tennou was a "god" among "humans", the incarnation of the national morals. This notion of ''kokutai'' was extra-juridical, more something cultural than positive. (2006:n.p.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This stemmed from [[Itō Hirobumi]]'s rejection of some European notions as unfit for Japan, as they stemmed from European constitutional practice and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Beasley, ''The Rise of Modern Japan'', p 79-80 {{ISBN|0-312-04077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The references to the ''kokutai'' were the justification of the emperor's authority through his divine descent and the unbroken line of emperors, and the unique relationship between subject and sovereign.&lt;ref name="beasley80"&gt;W. G. Beasley, ''The Rise of Modern Japan'', p 80 {{ISBN|0-312-04077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "family-state" element in it was given a great deal of prominence by political philosophy.&lt;ref name="beasley80"/&gt; Many conservatives supported these principles as central to ''Nihon shugi'' (''Nihon gunkoku shugi'', [[Japanese militarism]]), "Japanism", as an alternative to rapid Westernization.&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 427-8 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taishō Democracy===
From the [[Xinhai Revolution]] to the enactment of the [[Peace Preservation Law]] (1911–1925), the most important pre-World War II [[democracy movement]] "[[Taishō Democracy]]" occurred. During the Taishō Democracy, the political theorist [[Sakuzō Yoshino]] (1878–1933) rejected Western democracy ''minshu shugi'' (民主主義 lit. "people rule principle/-ism") and proposed a compromise on imperial democracy ''minpon shugi'' (民本主義 "people based principle/-ism"). However, as [[Japanese nationalism]] grew, questions arose whether the ''kokutai'' emperor could be limited by the ''seitai'' government.

The [[Peace Preservation Law]] of 1925 forbade both forming and belonging to any organization that proposed altering the ''kokutai'' or the abolishment of private property, effectively criminalizing socialism, communism, [[republicanism]], democracy and other anti-Tenno [[ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 390 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu|Tokkō]] ("Special Higher Police") was established as a type of [[Thought Police]] to investigate political groups that might threaten Tenno-centered social order of Japan.&lt;ref name="beasley184"&gt;W.

===Under the Public Safety Preservation Law===
[[Tatsukichi Minobe]] (1873–1948), a professor emeritus of law at [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]], theorized that under the Meiji Constitution, the emperor was an organ of the state and not a sacrosanct power beyond the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Gordon (historian)|Andrew Gordon]], ''A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present'', p198-9, {{ISBN|0-19-511060-9}}, {{OCLC|49704795}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was regarded as ''[[lèse-majesté]]''.&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 428 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minobe was appointed to the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] in 1932 but forced to resign after an assassination attempt and vehement criticisms that he was disloyal to the emperor.&lt;ref name="gordon199"&gt;Andrew Gordon, ''A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present'', p199, {{ISBN|0-19-511060-9}}, {{OCLC|49704795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Great efforts were made to foment a "Japanese spirit" even in popular culture, as in the promotion of the "Song of Young Japan."&lt;ref name="brendon441"&gt;[[Piers Brendon]], ''The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s'', p441 {{ISBN|0-375-40881-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Brave warriors united in justice
:In spirit a match for a million&amp;nbsp;–
:Ready like the myriad [[cherry blossom]]s to scatter
:In the spring sky of the [[Shōwa Restoration]].&lt;ref name="brendon441"/&gt;

The national debates over ''kokutai'' led the Prime Minister Prince [[Fumimaro Konoe]] to appoint a committee of Japan's leading professors to deliberate the matter. In 1937, they issued the ''Kokutai no Hongi'' (国体の本義, "Cardinal Principles of the National Body/Structure," see Gauntlett and Hall 1949). Miller gives this description.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The document known as the ''Kokutai no Hongi'' was actually a pamphlet of 156 pages, an official publication of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]], first issued in March 1937 and eventually circulated in millions of copies throughout the home islands and the empire. It contained the official teaching of the Japanese state on every aspect of domestic policy, international affairs, culture, and civilization. (1982:92)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It clearly stated its purpose: to overcome social unrest and to develop a new Japan.&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 465-6 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this pamphlet, pupils were taught to put the nation before the self, and that they were part of the state and not separate from it.&lt;ref name="G. Beasley, p 187"&gt;W. G. Beasley, ''The Rise of Modern Japan'', p 187 {{ISBN|0-312-04077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also instructed them in the principle of [[hakkō ichiu]], which would be used to justify imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 470 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brownlee concludes that after the ''Kokutai no Hongi'' proclamation,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear that at this stage in history, they were no longer dealing with a concept to generate spiritual unity like Aizawa Seishisai in 1825, or with a political theory of Japan designed to accommodate modern institutions of government, like the Meiji Constitution. The committee of professors from prestigious universities sought to define the essential truths of Japan, which might be termed religious, or even metaphysical, because they required faith at the expense of logic and reason. (2006:13) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Ministry of Education promulgated it throughout the school system.&lt;ref name="gordon199"/&gt;

By 1937, "election purification", originally aimed at corruption, required that no candidate set the people in opposition to either the military or the bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="gordon196"&gt;Andrew Gordon, ''A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present'', p196, {{ISBN|0-19-511060-9}}, {{OCLC|49704795}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was required because voters were required to support imperial rule.&lt;ref name="gordon196"/&gt;

Some objections to the founding of the ''Taisei Yokusankai'' or [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]], came on the grounds that ''kokutai'', already required all imperial subjects to support imperial rule.&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 454 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the leaders of Japan's "fascist-nationalist clique", writes Miller (1982:93), "''kokutai'' had become a convenient term for indicating all the ways in which they believed that the Japanese nation, as a political as well as a racial entity, was simultaneously different from and superior to all other nations on earth."

This term, and what it meant, were widely inculcated in propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Rhodes, ''Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II'', p246 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The final letters of [[kamikaze]] pilots expressed, above all, that their motivations were gratitude to Japan and to its Emperor as the embodiment of ''kokutai''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan Morris]], ''The Nobility of Failure: Tragic Heroes in the History of Japan'', p309 Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; A sailor might give his life to save the picture of the Emperor on a submarine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Masanori Ito (journalist)|Masanori Ito]], ''The End of the Imperial Japanese Navy'' p28 New York W.W. Norton &amp; Company 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, intellectuals at an "overcoming modernity" conference proclaimed that prior to the [[Meiji Restoration]], Japan has been a classless society under a benevolent emperor, but the restoration had plunged the nation into Western materialism (an argument that ignored commercialism and ribald culture in the Tokugawa era), which had caused people to forget their nature, which the war would enable them to reclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gordon, ''A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present'', p219-20, {{ISBN|0-19-511060-9}}, {{OCLC|49704795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Japanist" unions endeavoured to win support by disavowing violence and pledging support for nation and emperor.&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 467 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, because of the mistrust of unions in such unity, the Japanese went to replace them with "councils" in every factory, containing both management and worker representatives to contain conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gordon, ''A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present'', p195-6, {{ISBN|0-19-511060-9}}, {{OCLC|49704795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Nazi councils they were copying, this was part of a program to create a classless national unity.&lt;ref name="gordon196"/&gt;

Because many religions had figures that distracted from the central emperor, they were attacked, such as the [[Oomoto]] sect condemned for worshipping figures other than [[Amaterasu]], and in 1939, the Religious Organization authorized the shutting down of any religion that did not conform to the Imperial Way, which the authorities promptly used.&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 469 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirohito evoked the ''Kokutai'' in the [[Jewel Voice Broadcast]], which announced the Japanese acceptance of the [[Potsdam Declaration]] (unconditional surrender).

==Post-1945==
By the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the significance of ''kokutai'' diminished. In autumn 1945, [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|GHQ]] forbade circulation of the ''Kokutai no Hongi'' and repealed the [[Peace Preservation Law]] (15 October 1945). By enact of the [[Constitution of Japan|Constitution of the State of Japan]] (3 May 1947), [[Emperor of Japan|Tenno]]'s sovereignty and the ''lèse-majesté'' were repealed.

Nevertheless, some authors, including Miller (1982:95), believe that traces of Japanese ''kokutai'' "are quite as vivid today as they ever were".

'''Mythological objects''' encompass a variety of items (e.g. weapons, armor, clothing) found in Hindu mythology.

==Armour==

{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
;'''Kavacha'''
* '''Karna Kavacha''' - The armour of [[Karna]] that was granted by his father [[Surya]] at birth. It was impenetrable even to heavenly weapons.&lt;ref name="karna.org"&gt;[http://www.karna.org/body_story_behind_karna.html Website dedicated to the story of Karna]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Shiva-Kavacha''' - The armour of Lord [[Shiva]] which will make its wielder invincible
;'''Khetaka'''
* '''Jaivardhan''' - A shield of Lord [[Vishnu]] and Lord [[Shiva]].
* The shield of [[Samba (Krishna's son)|Shamba]].
* [[Srivatsa]] - The shield of [[Vishnu]], a symbol worshiped and revered by the Hindus, said to be manifested on the god's chest.&lt;ref&gt;Sarat Chandra Das (1902). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8AbIHweo7PMC Tibetan-English Dictionary with Sanskrit Synonyms]''. Calcutta, India: Bengal Secretariat Book Depot, p.&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-end}}

==Containers==
* [[Kalasha]] - The kalasha is considered a symbol of abundance and "source of life" in the Vedas. It is referred to as "overflowing full vase" in the Vedas. The Kalasha is believed to contain amrita, the elixir of life, and thus is viewed as a symbol of abundance, wisdom, and immortality. The Kalasha is often seen in Hindu iconography as an attribute, in the hands of Hindu deities like the creator god [[Brahma]], the destroyer god [[Shiva]] as a teacher, and the goddess of prosperity [[Lakshmi]].
* [[Kamandalu]] or kamandal or kamandalam - It is an oblong water pot made of a dry gourd (pumpkin) or coconut shell, metal, wood of the Kamandalataru tree,&lt;ref&gt;http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/shankara108m_sa.html, Shankarachrya’s ashtotaram)&lt;/ref&gt; or from clay, usually with a handle and sometimes with a spout. The kamandalu is used in Hindu iconography, in depiction of deities related with asceticism or water. It is, thus, viewed as a symbol of ascetism in Hinduism.&lt;ref name = "A"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jansen |first=Eva Rudy |title=The Book of Hindu Imagery  |year=1993 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1iASyoae8cMC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=Kamandalu&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2zD3j_c3YX3i7S_afvIBo5bFpJcQ#PPA52,M1 |accessdate=2008-08-21 |publisher=Binkey Kok Publications |isbn= 9789074597074 |pages=158}} p.52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Shankara]]charya’s ''ashtotaram'' hymn praises Shiva whose hand is adorned with the kamandalu. Other deities like the fire-god [[Agni]] and the preceptor of the gods, [[Brihaspati]], are depicted carrying the kamandalu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chaplin |first=Dorothea |title=Mythlogical Bonds Between East and West  |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GiAwgX1Eg1wC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Kamandalu&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0pxxG7H34NSD8UtWcsnONK3bFqog |accessdate=2008-08-21 |publisher=READ BOOKS |isbn= 9781406739862 |pages=160}} p.117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chakrabarti |first=Dilip K. |title=Archaeological Geography of the Ganga Plain  |year=2001 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEZe-wAIiKIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Kamandalu&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U03sZZ2EEqI4D6BbAIkQsYm5YRh2Q#PPA84,M1 |accessdate=2008-08-21 |publisher=Orient Longman |isbn= 9788178240169 |pages=301}} p.40&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Kapala]] - A kapala ''(Sanskrit for "skull")'' or skullcup is a cup made from a human skull used as a ritual implement (bowl) in both Hindu and Buddhist [[Tantra]].
* [[Kumbha]] - A kumbha is a type of pottery in India. It symbolises the womb, thus it represents fertility, life, generative power of human beings and sustenance and is generally associated with devis, particularly [[Ganga]].&lt;ref name=darian2001-p125&gt;{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=125}} Quote: The Kumbha: After the ''Makara'', Ganga's most distinctive sculptural feature is the full vase, first appearing with the river goddess on the same Varaha cave frieze from Udaygiri.  Although not common in the early stages of the Ganga image, the full vase appears more and more frequently as the Ganga theme reaches maturity.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispensers==
*[[Akshaya Patra]] - Akshayapatra ''(means an inexhaustible vessel)'', is an object from Hindu theology. It was a wonderful vessel given to [[Yudishtira]] by the Lord [[Surya]] which provided a never-failing supply of food to the [[Pandava]]s every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 65|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Akshaya Tunir''' - inexhaustible quiver of arrows of [[Arjuna]].

==Flags==
{{see|Dhvaja}}

*'''Garuda Dhwaja''' - The flag of [[Vishnu]].
*'''Indra Dhwaja''' - The flag of [[Indra]]. Also a festival of [[Indra]].
*'''Kakkai kodi''' - The flag of [[Jyestha (goddess)|Jyestha]], goddess of inauspicious things and misfortune.
*'''Kapi Dhwaja''' or ''Vanara dwaja (monkey flag)'' - The flag of [[Arjuna]] in the Mahabharata, in which the Lord [[Hanuman]] himself resided.&lt;ref name="Sri Ramakrishna Math 1985 p. 9"&gt;Sri Ramakrishna Math (1985) "Hanuman Chalisa" p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Makaradhvaja''' - The flag of [[Kama]], god of love.

'''Narakasura''' was a legendary figure, the progenitor of the [[Bhauma dynasty|Bhauma]] dynasty of [[Pragjyotisha Kingdom|Pragjyotisha]].  He is considered to be a son of Bhudevi, fathered by either [[Vishnu]] in his Varaha incarnation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimad Bhagavatam|publisher=The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.|page=3.3.6|url=http://vedabase.net/sb/3/3/6/en2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103145408/http://vedabase.net/sb/3/3/6/en2|archivedate=3 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or [[Hiranyaksha]] according to different texts.  He is claimed as one who established [[Pragjyotisha]]. He was killed by Krishna and his son, [[Bhagadatta]] of [[Mahabharata]] fame, succeeded him.

In the 10th century [[Kalika Purana]] he is claimed to have come from [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and said to have established the kingdom of [[Pragjyotisha Kingdom|Pragjyotisha]] after overthrowing the last of the [[Kirata]] king Ghatakasura of [[Danava dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Kali Prasad Goswami (2000),''Devadāsī: Dancing Damsel'', p.28  Pragjyotish can be regarded as a Dravida country which was overthrown by the Mongoloid people. Naraka regained this kingdom and drove away the Mongoloids. According to the Kalika Purana, when Naraka developed demonic qualities Vishnu was invited to kill him. In due course he came and killed Naraka and enthroned Bhagadatta. This Bhagadatta again introduced Saiva cult in Pragjyotisha.&lt;/ref&gt; It was foretold that he would be destroyed by a later incarnation of [[Vishnu]]. His mother, the earth, sought the boon from Vishnu that her son should have a long life, and that he should be all powerful. Vishnu granted these boons.&lt;ref&gt;George M. Williams (2008), ''Handbook of Hindu Mythology'', p.222&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of Naraka is important in the history of [[Assam]], particularly [[Kamrup region|Kamarupa]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;; since Narakasura is cited as the progenitor of all three dynasties that ruled [[Kamarupa]] in historical times. A hill, to the south of [[Guwahati]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Siba Pada Sen (1980), ''Sources of the history of India - Volume 3'', p.69&lt;/ref&gt; He is also associated with the Hindu belief of the [[shaktism|shakti]] goddess and place of worship [[Kamakhya]].&lt;ref&gt;Biswanarayan Shastri, Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (1994), ''Kalikapurana'', p.xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the legend==
Narakasura and his kingdom, Pragjyotisha, find mention in both the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Ramayana]], in the sections which were written not before the first century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Sircar|1990|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he is not depicted as the son of Bhudevi (earth) and Varaha incarnation of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Sircar|1990|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Bhagadatta]], is said to have fought for the [[Kaurava]]s in the Mahabharata battle.  Though the boar [[Prajapati]] finds mention as early as the [[Satapatha Brahmana]] and the Taittriya Aranyaka from the mid first millennium BCE, the avatars were associated with Vishnu later,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Sircar|1971|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became popular in the Gupta period&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Sircar|1990|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; (320-550 CE) and that the contact with Bhumi engendered a son is first mentioned in the Book II of the ''[[Harivamsa]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Sircar|1990|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is assigned to the fifth century.  This theme, that of the son Naraka, is further expanded in the later [[Vishnu Purana]] (5th-9th century).  In the 7th-century copper place inscriptions, [[Naraka]] is claimed as the originator of the [[Varman dynasty]] and that he lived three thousand years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;"The mythical ancestors of this line of rulers were Naraka, Bhagadatta and Vajradatta.  Three thousand years after these mythical ancestors there occurred Pushyavarman..." {{harv|Sharma|1978|p=xxix}} In the Nidhanpur copperplate inscription, it is mentioned: "When the kings of his (Vajradatta's) family having enjoyed the position (of rulers) for three thousand years had (all) attained the state of gods, Pushyavarman became the lord of the world." {{harv|Sharma|1978|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bhagavata Purana]] (8th-10th century), which was composed even later, expands the story even further.  The Naraka myth gets the most extensive elaboration in the Upapurana called [[Kalika Purana]] (10th century), which was composed in Assam itself. Here the myth of Janaka of Videha, the father of Sita, is embellished and added to the myth of Naraka.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Sircar|1990|pp=87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to other accounts, Naraka is not the son of Vishnu but of [[Hiranyaksha]], an [[Asura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Smith|2007|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
[[File:Krishna Cleaves the Demon Narakasura with his Discus.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Krishna decapitates the Naraka with his [[Sudarshana Chakra]]]]
[[File:Goddess of earth gives Aditi's earrings to Krishna.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Goddess of earth gives the Aditi's Kundalas to Krishna]]
The pious Naraka became evil, in association with [[Asura]] named [[Banasura]] and 'asura' (demon) was added to his name.&lt;ref&gt;Chandra Dhar Tripathi (2008), ''Kāmarūpa-Kaliṅga-Mithilā: a politico-cultural alignment in Eastern India : history, art, traditions'', p.98, p.p 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Naraka, motivated by his carnal desire, wanted to marry [[Kamakhya|Devi Kamakhya]]. When proposed, the Goddess playfully put a condition before him that if he would be able to build a staircase from the bottom of the Nilachal Hill to the temple within one night before the cock crows to indicate Dawn, then she would surely marry him.
Naraka took it as a challenge and tried all with his might to do this huge task. He was almost about to accomplish the job before it was dawn. When Kamakhya Devi got this news, panic-stricken she strangled a cock and made it crow untimely to give the impression of Dawn to Naraka. Duped by the trick even Naraka thought that it was a futile job and left it half way through. Later he chased the cock and killed it. Now the place is known as Kukurakata situated in the district of Darrang. The incomplete staircase is known as Mekhelauja Path.&lt;ref&gt;Kāmarūpa Anusandhān Samiti (2007),''Journal of the Assam Research Society - Volume 38'',p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Drunk with power, as he knew himself to be unrivalled in prowess, he brought all the kingdoms on earth under his control. Next, he turned his eyes towards [[Svarga|Swargaloka]]. Even the mighty [[Indra]] could not withstand the assault of this son of [[Vishnu]] and had to flee the heavens. 
Narakasura had become the overlord of both the heavens and earth. Addicted to power, he stole the earrings of [[Aditi]], the heavenly mother goddess, and usurped some of her territory, while also kidnapping [[Junior wives of Krishna|16000 women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swami|first=Parmeshwaranand|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of the Puranas|year=2001|publisher=Sarup and Sons|location=New Delhi|isbn=8176252263|page=941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], led by [[Indra]], went to Vishnu to ask him to deliver them from Narakasura. Vishnu promised them that he would attend to this matter, when he would be incarnated as [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;B. K. Chaturvedi (2017), ''Vishnu Puran''&lt;/ref&gt;

As promised to Mother Earth, Narakasura was allowed to enjoy a long reign. At last Vishnu was born as Krishna. Aditi, who was a relative of Krishna's wife [[Satyabhama]] (believed to be an Avatar of [[Bhudevi]] - Narakasura' mother), approached Satyabhama for help. When Satyabhama heard of the Narakasura's ill treatment of women and his behaviour with Aditi, she was enraged. Satyabhama approached Lord Krishna for permission to wage a war against Narakasura. As promised to the Devas and Aditi, Krishna attacked the great fortress of Narakasura, riding his mount [[Garuda]] with wife Satyabhama.
Lord Krishna used the Narayanastra and the Agneyastra against the army of Narakasura.
The battle was furiously fought. Narakasura possessed 11 [[Akshauhini]]s that he unleashed on Lord Krishna. However, the Lord slew them all with little effort. Lord Krishna also killed Mura, Narakasura's general. Thus Krishna is called 'Murāri' (the killer of Mura).&lt;ref&gt;Dianne M. MacMillan (2008), ''Diwali: Hindu Festival of Lights'', p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

Narakasura used several divine weapons against Lord Krishna, but Krishna easily neutralised all those weapons. Narakasura used the Brahmastra against Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with his own Brahmastra. Narakasura used the Agneyastra against Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with the Varunastra. Narakasura used the Nagapasha against Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with the Garudastra. In desperation, Narakasura launched the Vaishnavastra on Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with another Vaishnavastra. At last, when Narakasura tried to kill Lord Krishna with a trident, Lord Krishna beheaded him with his Sudarshana Chakra (discus).&lt;ref&gt;Ayilam Subrahmaṇya Pañcāpageśa Ayyar (1957), ''Sri Krishna: The Darling of Humanity'', p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Narakasura's death, he requested a boon from his mother, Satyabhama, that everyone should celebrate his death with colorful light. Thus this day is celebrated as '[[Naraka Chaturdashi]]' - the day before [[Diwali]]. Krishna's and Satyabhama's victory on Narakasura translated into freedom for all his prisoners and honoring of Aditi.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel Marion Underhill (1991), ''The Hindu Religious Year'', p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of Pontmain''', also known as '''Our Lady of Hope''' is the title given to the [[Virgin Mary]] on her apparition at [[Pontmain]], [[France]] on 17 January 1871. These apparitions were approved by [[Pope Pius IX]].  

==The Apparition==
The Franco-Prussian War (War of 1870) was the culmination of years of tension between the two nations, which finally came to a head on 19 July 1870, when Emperor Napoleon III of the second Empire declared war against [[Prussia]]. From the first days of the war, defeat followed defeat. By January 1871, [[Paris]] was under siege, two-thirds of the country was in the power of the Prussians, and they were advancing.

The apparition is said to have occurred at the height of the Franco-Prussian War. Pontmain, a hamlet of about 500 inhabitants, lay between the oncoming Prussian army and the city of Laval.  The Barbedette family consisted of father César, his wife, Victoire, with their two sons Joseph and Eugène, aged ten and twelve, and another older boy who was away in the army. On the evening of 17 January 1871, the two boys were helping their father in the barn when the elder, Eugène, walked over towards the door to look out. As he gazed at the star studded sky he suddenly he saw an apparition of a beautiful woman smiling at him; she was wearing a blue gown covered with golden stars, and a black veil under a golden crown.&lt;ref name=airmaria&gt;[http://airmaria.com/2009/01/16/our-lady-of-pontmain-%e2%80%9cbut-pray-my-children%e2%80%a6%e2%80%9d/ "Our Lady of Pontmain", ''Air Maria'', the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate in the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pontmain (53) Basilique Vitrail 4.jpg|thumb|Norte-Dame d'Esperance de Pontmain]]
His father, brother, and a neighbour came out to look and Joseph immediately said he too could see the apparition although the adults saw nothing. The mother, Victoire, came out but she too could see nothing.&lt;ref name=airmaria/&gt; The boys’ parents could not see what their children were seeing that night and called for Sister Vitaline, the local school teacher. She, like the boys’ parents, could also not see the apparition, and called for two girls, Françoise Richer and Jeanne-Marie Lebosse, aged nine and eleven. Sister Vitaline suggested that perhaps Our Lady was visible only to the children. Without any knowledge of the apparition, these two girls looked into the night sky and began describing Our Lady in the same exact detail as the Barbedette boys had described.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feliciansistersna.org/spirituality/our-lady-of-hope Province of Our Lady of Hope, Felician Sisters]&lt;/ref&gt;

A crowd gathered to pray as word quickly spread among the anxious villagers. Children saw the beautiful Lady, and gleefully pointed up to her. Adults, however, only saw three stars forming a triangle. As they prayed the Rosary, the children saw the garment's stars multiply until it was almost entirely gold. Next, the children saw a banner unfurl beneath the Lady. Slowly, a message appeared: ''But pray, my children. God will hear you in time. My Son allows Himself to be touched.'' Upon hearing the message read aloud, the crowd spontaneously began the hymn "Mother of Hope". As they sang, Our Lady laughed and joined in the singing.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; 

The children squealed with delight as her hands kept time with the music. When the crowd began "My Sweet Jesus," her expression changed to profound sadness and a red crucifix appeared in her hands, with the words "Jesus Christ" above it. Her eyes mournfully contemplated the cross during the hymn. As the people sang the "Ave Maris Stella," the cross vanished and her smile returned, though with a touch of melancholy. Two small white crosses then appeared on her shoulders before Our Lady disappeared behind a cloud.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; As the night prayers came to a close, the apparition ended. It was about nine o'clock. The Apparition had lasted about three hours.

===The Description of the Lady===
Years later, Joseph Barbadette, who later afterwards became a priest of the Congregation of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, recounted:
 
She was young and tall of stature, clad in a garment of deep blue, ... Her dress was covered with brilliant gold stars. The sleeves were ample and long. She wore slippers of the same blue as the dress, ornamented with gold bows. On the head was a black veil half covering the forehead, concealing the hair and ears, and falling over the shoulders. Above this was a crown resembling a diadem, higher in front than elsewhere, and widening out at the sides. A red line encircled the crown at the middle. Her hands were small and extended toward us as in the 'miraculous medal.' Her face had the most exquisite delicacy and a smile of ineffable sweetness.

===After the Apparition===

That same evening the Prussian forces inexplicably abandoned their advance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.rendezvousenfrance.com/en/information/notre-dame-pontmain-lesser-known-our-lady-france-0 Alves, Liane. Notre Dame de Pontmain, the Lesser-Known "Our Lady of France", ''Rendez-vous en France'' magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; General von Schmidt of the Prussian Army who was about to move on the city of Laval towards Pontmain, received orders from his Commander not to take the city.

On the evening of 17 January 1871, the Commander of the Prussian forces, having taken up his quarters at the archiepiscopal palace of Le Mans, told Msgr. Fillion, Bishop of that [[diocese]]: ''"By this time my troops are at Laval"''. On the same evening, the Prussian troops in sight of Laval stopped at half-past five o'clock, about the time when the Apparition first appeared above Pontmain, a few miles off. General Schmidt is reported to have said on the morning of the 18th: ''"We cannot go farther. Yonder, in the direction of Brittany, there is an invisible '[[The Madonna|Madonna]]' barring the way."''
 
The sudden stopping of the Prussian forces in sight of Laval, and their retirement the following morning, meant, together with the saving of Brittany, the turning back of the tide of conquering soldiery from that part of France. The war was practically at an end. On 23 January 1871, the long-hoped for [[Armistice]] was signed. Soon all the thirty-eight conscripted men and boys returned home unscathed.

==Authorization of Our Lady of Hope==
After that the devotion to the ''Blessed Virgin'' under the title of that of Notre Dame d'Esperance de Pontmain, ''Our Lady of Hope of Pontmain'', was authorized by the ecclesiastical authorities, and the confraternity of that name has been extended all over the world.

After the apparition of '''Our Lady of Hope''' on 17 January 1871, pilgrims made up of both the clergy and the laity came to Pontmain. At the same time, inquiries and investigations were made about the apparition; the visionary children were submitted to various intense interrogations. Finally, on the [[Feast of the Purification]], 2 February 1872, Msgr. Wicart, [[Bishop of Laval]], issued a pastoral letter giving a canonical judgment on the apparition. Thus, the [[veneration]] of ''Our Lady of Hope'' of Pontmain was given official Church recognition and approval. 

Joseph Barbadette became a priest of the Congregation of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate; his brother Eùgene became a secular priest. He was assisted by one of the girls who had seen Mary as his housekeeper, and the other, Jeanne-Marie Lebossé, became a nun.&lt;ref name=airmaria/&gt;

==Veneration==
In May 1872, Bishop Wicart authorized the construction of a sanctuary, which was consecrated in October 1900. In 1905 Pope [[Pius X]] elevated the Sanctuary to the status of a basilica.&lt;ref name=sanctuary&gt;[http://www.sanctuaire-pontmain.com/History-of-the-Sanctuary.html?lang=fr "History of the Sanctuary", Sanctuaire-Pontmain]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Pius XI]] gave a final decision regarding the mass and office in honor of ''Our Lady of Hope'' of Pontmain. A final papal honor was given to ''Our Lady of Hope'' on 16 July 1932 by Cardinal Pacelli, who later became [[Pope Pius XII]], by passing a decree from the Chapter of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] that the statue of the ''Blessed Lady, Mother of Hope,'' be solemnly honored with the crown of gold. ''The Lady'' then was crowned in the presence of archbishop, bishops, priests and the laity by [[Cardinal Verdier]], [[Archbishop of Paris]]. The coronation took place on 24 July 1934.&lt;ref name=sanctuary/&gt;

At Pontmain, it was a matter of a message of prayer, very simple in the dramatic circumstances of war and invasion.  At Pontmain, Mary is a sign of hope in the midst of war. A place of pilgrimage, it attracts annually around 200,000 drawn from among the people of the region, with some international pilgrimages, especially from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20160506201439/http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/buby/mfl1.htm Marian Apparitions]'', [[University of Dayton]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Notre-Dame-de-Pontmain, Quebec]] is a municipality in Canada that was named after the apparition. Our Lady of Hope is a Roman Catholic Parish of the Diocese of Sault Ste. Marie located in [[Sudbury, Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourladyofhope.ca/ Our Lady of Hope Parish, Sudbury, ON]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Hope of Pontmain at the [[National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]] in Washington, D.C. Funds for this chapel were donated by [[Bob Hope]] and his wife Dolores. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kintera.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=etITK6OTG&amp;b=309286&amp;ct=160562 Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7815">'''Paul Saltzman''' is a two-time [[Canadian]] [[Emmy Award]]-winning film and television [[Film producer|producer]]-[[Film director|director]] with more than 300 films, both dramas and documentaries, to his credit. The 2008 documentary feature, ''[[Prom Night in Mississippi]]'', featuring actor [[Morgan Freeman]], premiered at the 2009 [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promnightinmississippi.com Prom Night In Mississippi website]&lt;/ref&gt; His most recent film, the feature documentary, ''The Last White Knight—Is Reconciliation Possible?''&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|2274064|The Last White Knight}}&lt;/ref&gt; premiered at TIFF ([[Toronto International Film Festival]]) in 2012. It features Morgan Freeman, [[Harry Belafonte]], Delay de la Beckwith (son of [[Byron De La Beckwith]]) as well as Saltzman himself. He is also founder, CEO and president of the [[Charitable organization|charitable]], [[non-profit]] organization Moving Beyond Prejudice, which works with police forces, students, educators, youth-at-risk and community groups.

==Early life==
He was born in 1943 the son of [[Percy Saltzman]], Canada's first English-speaking TV weatherman, and Rose Cohen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/media/story/2007/01/16/saltzman-death.html CBC News], Jan 17 2007&lt;/ref&gt; After briefly studying mathematics and science, he did congressional civil rights lobbying in [[Washington, D.C.]], and in the summer of 1965 he did voter registration work in Mississippi as part of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), which would later lead him to go back to the area to explore the concept of prejudice and racism with his first documentary feature film, ''Prom Night in Mississippi''. He lives in the [[Toronto]] area, and has one daughter, Devyani Saltzman, a writer and literary curator, with his ex-wife, director and screenwriter [[Deepa Mehta]]. His partner is Anne Peace, a writer and joyologist.

==The Beatles==
{{main|The Beatles in India}}
In 1968, at the age of 23, he traveled to India for the first time as sound engineer on the National Film Board of Canada's ''Juggernaut'' documentary. He studied [[meditation]] to recover after his girlfriend had broken up with him, by mail. He learned [[Transcendental Meditation technique|meditation]] at the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]'s ashram in the holy city of [[Rishikesh]], India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paul|first1=Satarupa|title=Beatles ashram in Rishikesh to be turned into a museum soon|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch-stories/beatles-ashram-in-rishikesh-to-be-renovated/article1-1365794.aspx|website=Hindustan Times|accessdate=19 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bfGVgp68|archivedate=19 September 2015|date=12 July 2015|quote=I took a train to Rishikesh and arrived at the ashram. … I learnt meditation in five minutes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was invited by [[The Beatles]], who coincidentally were visiting the ashram, to join them.  While there, he spent time with and photographed the Beatles, Donovan, Mia and Prudence Farrow and Mike Love.  His photos have been judged "some of the best intimate shots" ever taken of [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]], and have been seen in galleries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/entertainment/music/bobandbeatles.shtml BBC News story on London gallery show].&lt;/ref&gt; A permanent exhibition of his The Beatles in India photographs can be seen above the retail units in the departure lounge of [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iconic Art Joins Arrivals at John Lennon Airport|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2007/11/20/iconic-art-joins-arrivals-at-liverpool-airport-99623-20131815/|accessdate=1 February 2013|newspaper=Liverpool Daily Post|date=20 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Saltzman released a book of his photographs, ''The Beatles in Rishikesh'', with Penguin-Putnam; and in 2006 he self-published a deluxe limited edition box set, ''The Beatles in India''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050327/asp/look/story_4519992.asp ''Calcutta Telegraph''], "Long and Winding Road to Rishikesh," March 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most memorable things Saltzman absorbed during his conversations and life-changing stay with The Beatles was George Harrison's words: "Like we're The Beatles, after all, aren't we? We have all the money you could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for.  But it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050327/asp/look/story_4535123.asp ''Calcutta Telegraph''], Calcutta, India, March 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saltzman has been to India over 55 times. He led special tours of India in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016. Called "India with Paul Saltzman: A Fusion of Colour, Music &amp; Soul", it shares his love of and favourite places in India. Included is how India impacted and enlightened The Beatles, and led to the group's most creative musical period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bestway.com/itineraries/beatles_india.php The Beatles In India Tour, Bestway Tours and Safaris website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and TV career==
Saltzman began his film and television career at the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] as a researcher, interviewer and on-air host, and then moved to the [[National Film Board of Canada]]. He assisted in the launch of a new film format as second-unit director and production manager of the first [[IMAX]] film, produced for the Osaka [[Expo '70]]. In 1972, he produced and directed his first film, a half-hour documentary on [[Bo Diddley]].

In 1973, Saltzman founded Sunrise Films Limited. He produced and directed documentaries for the next decade, including the award-winning series ''Spread Your Wings''. His work included producing, directing, writing, editing, cinematography and sound recording. In 1983, he turned to drama, producing and directing the premiere of ''[[HBO]]'s Family Playhouse'' and a special for ''[[American Playhouse]]''. That year, he co-created and produced the family action-adventure television series ''[[Danger Bay]]''; the hit [[CBC Television|CBC]]–[[Disney Channel]] series ran for six years and 123 episodes.

Since then he has produced television series such as ''[[My Secret Identity]]'', ''Matrix'' and ''Max Glick'', as well as miniseries and movies of the week. He co-produced the feature film ''[[Map of the Human Heart]]'', an international epic directed by [[Vincent Ward (director)|Vincent Ward]], starring [[Jason Scott Lee]], [[Anne Parillaud]], [[Patrick Bergin]], [[John Cusack]] and [[Jean Moreau]]. He also executive produced ''Martha, Ruth &amp; Edie'' as well as ''Sam &amp; Me'', which received an Honorable Mention in competition for the [[Camera d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

Saltzman is a member of the [[Director's Guild of Canada]] and the [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promnightinmississippi.com ''Prom Night In Mississippi'' film website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1240">A '''Pontifical Delegate''' is a cleric who is delegated by the [[Pope]].

Specifically, this title is used for the following ecclesiastical offices in the gift of the Pope (who is [[Pontifex Maximus]], hence the adjective):
* a [[prelate]] (usually an [[Archbishop]] or [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]) appointed to represent the Holy See in the administration of certain [[pontifical minor basilica]]s, notably:
** [[Pontifical Delegation for the Basilica of St. Nicholas of Bari]]
** [[Pontifical Delegation for the Shrine of the Holy House of Loreto]]
** [[Pontifical Delegation for the Basilica of St. Anthony of Padua]]
** [[Pontifical Delegation for the Shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompeii]]
* a [[papal legate]] or papal diplomat, such as a [[Nuncio]]
* an extraordinary papal representative to a religious congregation, e.g. the thirty-third General Congregation of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]
* a papal representative appointed to exercise certain rights reserved, thus limiting the authority of a [[major archbishop]], as in the case of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]]

'''Shapurji Edalji''' (1841/1842 – 23 May 1918) was an Indian-born convert to Anglicanism who was likely  the first person from [[South Asia]] to be made the [[vicar]] of an English [[parish (Church of England)|parish]]. His achievements have however been overshadowed by the worldwide fascination with [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]’s campaign to prove his son [[George Edalji|George]] innocent of wounding a pony in 1903. The popularity of [[Julian Barnes]]’s novel ''[[Arthur and George]]'' (2005) has had the same effect.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=57480|title=Edalji, Shapurji (1841/2–1918), Church of England clergyman and victim of racial harassment|first= Richard |last= Davenport-Hines|authorlink=Richard Davenport-Hines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Shapurji Edalji was born in [[Bombay]] in 1841 or 1842, the son of Doralji Edalji, a [[Parsi]] merchant. He attended the [[Elphinstone College]], where he was taught by [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] and was a classmate of [[Dinshaw Eduljee Wacha]], who along with Naoroji, himself a former Elphinstone scholar,&lt;ref&gt;Sir D. E. Wacha, ''Shells from the Sands of Bombay: My Recollections and Reminiscences 1860-75'', 1920&lt;/ref&gt; became a founder member of the [[Indian National Congress]] in [[Bombay]] in 1885.

In defiance of his family, Edalji converted to Christianity in 1856,&lt;ref&gt;John Wilson, ''The Star of Bethlehem and the Magi from the East: A Sermon Preached on the Occasion of the Baptism of a Parsi Youth'' 31 August, MDCCCLVI, Smith Taylor &amp; Co, Bombay, 2nd ed, 1857&lt;/ref&gt; under the influence of [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Kirk]] missionary [[John Wilson (missionary)|John Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;George Smith, ''Life of John Wilson'', John Murray, 1878&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to the Free Kirk College in Mumbai in 1864. He then worked for a year as a missionary among the pre-literate [[Warli]] people before becoming an [[Anglican]]. He published a ''Gujerati and English Dictionary'' (1863), ''The Brahma Samaja'', which was a lecture to the Bombay Dialectic Association (1864), and a ''Grammar of the Gujerati'' Language (1867).&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

== Life in England ==
In 1866 he travelled to [[St Augustine's College, Canterbury]], to train as a missionary. He stayed in England, however, and was eventually ordained in [[Oxford]]. In 1869 he received his first [[curacy]] at [[Burford]]. Afterwards he was curate at [[Holy Trinity Church, Headington Quarry|Holy Trinity, Oxford]] (1869–70), in the Lancashire parishes of [[Farnworth]] and [[Toxteth]] (1870–72, 1874–5), [[St Levan]], Cornwall (1873–4), and [[Bromley St Leonard]] (1875–6).

On 17 June 1874 he married Charlotte Elizabeth Stuart (1842–1924), daughter of Thompson Stoneham, Vicar of Ketley in [[Shropshire]]. They had three children: [[George Edalji|George]] (1876–1953), Horace (1879–1952 or 1953) and Maud (1882–1961).&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

In 1876, [[George Selwyn (Bishop of Lichfield)|George Selwyn]], the [[Bishop of Lichfield]], appointed Edalji as Vicar of [[St Mark's Church, Great Wyrley|St Mark's church]], and the parish of [[Great Wyrley]], Staffordshire, where he served until his death forty-two years later. In securing this position Edalji may well have been the first South Asian to become the incumbent of an English parish. [[Collieries]] and [[agriculture]] provided the chief employment in the area. A devoted clergyman, though unflinching and sometimes controversial when it came to defending his fundamental principles, he published his ''Lectures on St Paul's Epistles to the Galatians'' in 1879. He was on the one hand a fine preacher but on the other sometimes a cause of tension in the parish, for example when he engaged in bitter battles over the future of the local Church of England schools.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

== Case of George Edalji ==
The lives of the five Edalji family members were clouded in 1888 by the appearance of a series of abusive letters in [[Great Wyrley]], most of them directed against the Edalji family itself. There was a further flood of offensive letters between 1892 and 1895, and the family was also subject to a series of hoaxes. When the Staffordshire [[Chief Constable]] indicated that he suspected George of writing the letters Shapurji argued vehemently in his son's defence. This was also his role after October 1903, when George was convicted of wounding a pony, the 8th of the so-called Wyrley outrages of that year; Shapurji campaigned passionately on his son's behalf, and in 1905 produced a booklet, ''The Case of George Edalji'', which provided a detailed analysis of the woeful police and prosecution case against his son.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

== Last years ==
Edalji's eyesight faded in later years, and by the time of the [[First World War]] he was having difficulty in seeing at all. His daughter had to lead him to the pulpit during church services. He died on 23 May 1918, five weeks after suffering a [[cerebral haemorrhage]], and was buried in the parish churchyard.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">'''Sharwin III''' ({{lang-fa|شروین}}), was the fourteenth ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] briefly in 986. He was the brother and successor of [[al-Marzuban]].

Sharwin was the son of [[Rustam II]]. In 986, after the death of Rustam II, Sharwin's brother al-Marzuban ascended the Bavandid throne. There have been several confusions about the reign of the Bavandid kings after the death of Rustam II. In 986, al-Marzuban is no longer mentioned as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty, and Sharwin III is instead mentioned as the ruler of the dynasty. A certain [[Shahriyar III]] is later mentioned as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty in the following year. Nothing more is known about Sharwin III.

'''[[Stupa]]s''', also called '''dagobas''' and '''[[cetiya]]s''', are considered an outstanding type of architectural creation of ancient [[Sri Lanka]]. Under the influence of [[Buddhism]], there were several changes in the field of architecture in Sri Lanka. The stupa commands a prominent place among these changes. The Stupa is also known by synonymous names such as Chaithya, Dagaba, Thupa, Seya and Vehera.&lt;ref name="SocialStudies&amp;History"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Studies and History Grade 10, Sri Lanka|year=2006|publisher=Educations Publications Department, Sri Lanka|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stupas designed and constructed in Sri Lanka are the largest brick structures known to the pre-modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, R. 1990, "Bricks – A unit of construction in ancient Sri Lanka", ICTAD Journal, Vol.2, No. 1, pp. 21-42, Colombo.&lt;/ref&gt;  

After [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] introduced Buddhism during the reign of King [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]] (307-267 BCE), in the Sri Lanka’s ancient sacred capital of [[Anuradhapura]], the king built the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya]], a [[mahavihara]], after dedicating the [[Nandana]] and [[Mahamega]] royal pleasure gardens to the Maha Sangha. The earliest monument found in Sri Lanka is the Stupa, which is described as a hemispherical dome surmounted with a spire (''kota'').

[[Mahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara]] in Mahiyangana, [[Uva Province]] is regarded as the first stupa of ancient Sri Lanka&lt;ref name="Mahi"/&gt;The first historical stupa constructed after the arrival of Mahinda in Sri Lanka is [[Thuparamaya]], which was built during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa.&lt;ref name="Lakpura"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lanka.com/about/destinations/anuradhapura/ | title=City of Anuradhapura | publisher=www.lanka.com | accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards many stupas were built, some colossal stupas, biggest of which is [[Jetavanaramaya]].&lt;ref name="Lankave Stupaya(Stupa of Sri lanka)"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lankave Stupaya(Stupa of Sri lanka)|year=2004|pages=66|author=Professor T.G.Kulathunga|edition=first|language=Sinhala|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Stupas==

[[File:Mahiyangana Dagoba.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mahiyangana Stupa is the first stupa of ancient Sri Lanka&lt;ref name="Mahi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/080629/Plus/timesplus0011.html | title=Tales from the hills of Uva | publisher=The Sunday Times | date=29 June 2008 | accessdate=30 September 2014 | author=Upali Salgado}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are two recorded instances regarding the construction of stupas in Sri Lanka in the lifetime of [[Gautama Buddha]]. One of those instances is the construction of the cetiya at [[Mahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara]] at [[Mahiyangana]] in the valley of Mahaweli, which enshrines the Buddha's Hair Relic reputedly presented by the Buddha to [[saman (deity)|Saman]], a [[deva (Buddhism)|deva]].The other instance is the construction of a stupa at Tiriyaya enshrining the Hair Relics presented to the tradesman brothers Tapussa and Bhallika from Okkalapa (present-day Yangon). The gift of the Hair Relics to the brothers is explicitly mentioned in the Pali Tipitaka. The latter This event is mentioned in an inscription written in [[Sanskrit]] found at this site.&lt;ref name="SocialStudies&amp;History" /&gt;

During the time of [[Ashoka]], numerous ‘stupas’ were built at hallowed sites in [[India]]. In these were enshrined relics of the Buddha which people venerated. When it was observed that there were no Buddha relics in Sri Lanka, the king, at Mahinda’s suggestion, appealed to Emperor Asoka to send some relics. He responded to the king’s request and sent the right collarbone relic of the Buddha. King Devanam Piya Tissa built the Thuparamaya to enshrine this relic, the right collarbone of the Buddha. The Thuparamaya is regarded as the first ever historical stupa built in Sri Lanka. The building of colossal stupas started during the reign of King [[Dutugamunu]]. Afterward many kings built stupas.&lt;ref name="SocialStudies&amp;History" /&gt;

==Construction of a stupa==

The construction of stupas were considered acts of great merit. The purpose of stupas were mainly to enshrine [[relic]]s of Buddha. The design specifications are consistent within most of the stupas, entrances to stupas are laid out so that their centre lines point to the relic chambers.&lt;ref name="pieris"&gt;Pieris K (2006), Architecture and landscape in ancient and medieval Lanka&lt;/ref&gt;

The stupas were covered with a coating of lime [[plaster]], plaster combinations changed with the requirements of the design, items used included lime, clay, sand, pebbles, crushed seashells, sugar syrup, white of egg, coconut water, plant resin, drying oil, glues and saliva of white ants.&lt;ref name="pieris"/&gt; The fine plaster at [[Kiri Vehera]] used small pebbles, crushed seashells mixed with lime and sand were used in the stupas from the fifth to twelfth centuries.

==Parts==
[[File:Tissamaharama Stupa.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tissamaharama Raja Maha Vihara|Tissamaharama Stupa]] across the paddy fields (''Gharbaya'', ''Hatharas Kotuwa'', ''Devatha Kotuwa'', ''Koth Kerella'' and ''Kotha'' of the stupa are visible).]]

A stupa usually has six parts:&lt;ref name="Lankave Stupaya(Stupa of Sri lanka)"/&gt; 
* '''Pesavalalu''' – Berms or terraces
A stupa consists of three such berms at its base. The three berms rising from the base gradually reduce in size.
* '''Gharbaya''' – Hemispherical dome
The hemispherical dome is constructed on the three berms. In the middle of the dagaba was built a relic chamber (Dhathu garbhaya). The Buddha's relics are enshrined there. In the centre of the Relic Chamber was placed a bo-tree made of precious metals, and an image of the Buddha round which were groups of figures representing various events in the life of the Buddha.
* '''Hatharas Kotuwa''' - Tee cube
Relics are enshrined in this part too.
* '''Devatha Kotuwa''' - Cylindrical neck
This is built on the Hatharas Kotuwa. Figures of deities are carved on the surface.
* '''Koth Kerella''' - Conical spire
This is built on the Devatha Kotuwa. A crystal (chudamanikya) on a pinnacle made of metal is placed at the top of the spire to adorn it.
* '''Kotha''' – This is also called "silumina" in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]. This is usually a pinnacle made of metal on top of which is a precious crystal or gemstone(chudamanikya).

There are other constructions associated with the stupa:
* [[Vahalkada]] (frontispiece)
This is a structure constructed joining the stupa at its four cardinal directions as a decorative flourish. Later these frontispieces came to be decorated or embellished with designs such as the creeper design. Stone slabs erected for the purpose of offering flower at the stupa too have been added to these frontispieces.
* [[Chethiyagara]] (shrine house) or [[Vatadage]] (circular relic chamber)
The chetiyagara is a structure constructed as a protection chamber for the stupa. There is evidence to show that such chambers were erected to shelter the small stupas built during the early years. The roofs of these structures are believed to have been wooden.&lt;ref name="SocialStudies&amp;History" /&gt;

==Types of Stupas==

Basically, a stupa has several salient features. [[Buddhist literature]] mentions six types of stupas differing according to the shape of the dome or body of a dagaba.&lt;ref name="SocialStudies&amp;History" /&gt; This is mentioned in "Vijayantha Potha".&lt;ref name="Lankave Stupaya(Stupa of Sri lanka)"/&gt; 

They are:
* '''Dhanyakara'''  - Heap of paddy shape
e.g. : [http://www.srilankaview.com/kelaniya.htm Kelaniya stupa]
* '''Ghantakara'''  - Bell shape
e.g. : Ambastala dagaba at Mihintale
* '''Bubbulakara''' - Bubble shape
e.g. : Ruwanweli Maha Seya at Anuradhapura, Rankoth Vehera &amp; Kiri Vehera at Pollonnaruwa
[[File:Kiri Vihara 01.jpg|thumb|Kiri Vihara stupa, Polonnaruwa has the 'Bubble shape']]
* '''Ghatakara'''   - Pot shape
e.g. : Situlpavwa, [[Somawathiya Chaitya|Somawathiya]], [[Kiri Vehera]] at Kataragama
 
* '''Padmakara'''   - Lotus shape
e.g. : Vijayarama at Anuradhapura, Puliyankulama, Indikatu Seya at Mihintale
* '''Amlakara'''    - Shape of Nelli fruit (''[[Phyllanthus emblica]]'' L.)
No records exist of the finding of this type of stupa in Sri Lanka.&lt;br /&gt;

Another type of stupa is mentioned in the book "Manju Sri Vasthu Vidya Shastra"
* '''Palandawakara''' - Shape of an onion
e.g. : Nadigamvila stupa&lt;ref name="Lankave Stupaya(Stupa of Sri lanka)"/&gt;

==Thuparamaya==

King Devanam Piya Tissa built the [[Thuparama]] dagaba to enshrine the Right Collar Bone of Lord Buddha. The Thuparama is regarded as the first ever historical stupa built in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="SocialStudies&amp;History" /&gt; Originally it was in the shape of a heap of paddy but as restorations were done in later years, it took the form as seen today. It has a diameter of {{convert|59|ft|6|in|m}} at the base. As the name suggests, Thuparama comprised a ‘stupa’ and an ‘arama,’ a residential complex. Ruins of such a complex can be seen within an area of over {{convert|3|acre|m2}} around the ‘stupa.’

==The Great Stupas of Sri Lanka==

The ‘stupas’ built later on were much larger than the Thuparama.It is accepted that the building of colossal stupas started during the reigh of [[King Dutugemunu]]. King Dutugemunu (161-137 BC) built the Mirisaveti which has a diameter of {{convert|168|ft|m}} at the base and the most venerated ‘stupa’ - Ruvanvali Mahaseya, also known as Ratnamali Mahathupa. While the base has a diameter of {{convert|289|ft|m}}, the height is given as 120 cubits (‘riyan’), equivalent to around {{convert|300|ft|m}}. It took the form of ‘bubbulakara’ or bubble shape. When the Abhyayagiri dagaba was originally built by King Vattagamani ([[Valagamba]] - 103 BC) it was not very large but later enlargements made it larger than the Mahathupa. 

[[File:Jetavanaramaya Stupa.jpg|thumb|[[Jetavanaramaya]] in Anuradhapura is the biggest brick structure in the world.&lt;ref name="IESL"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/130707/education/national-engineering-technological-heritage-gallery-ceremonially-opened-51290.html | title=National Engineering Technological Heritage Gallery ceremonially opened | publisher=The Sunday Times | accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
King Mahasena (276-303 CE) is credited with building the largest of them all - the Jetavana, which has a diameter of {{convert|367|ft|m}} at the base. Though the present height is estimated at {{convert|232|ft|m}}, the original height is supposed to have been 400 feet.
The main feature of Jetavana is its foundation, which goes all the way to the bedrock and {{convert|25|ft|m}} deep.  The height of Jetavana and the depth of the footing is approximately equal. Large stupas were also built at Mihintale at the site where Arahat Mahinda met the king, Magama, Dighavapi (near Ampara), Kataragama and other places. The builders of ‘stupas’ in Sri Lanka had closely followed the designs of such monuments built in Sanchi and other places in India. In huge monuments, the dome rose from a triple-based platform. The dome was surmounted by a square railing of wood or stone which later became a cube of masonry. A stone pillar embedded in the dome rose above the railing. The ‘stupa’ was crowned by an umbrella (‘[[Chhatra|chattra]]’) or a series of umbrellas.

==Small Stupas==

The Kantaka Chaitya in Mihintale is a fine example of a small dagoba. It features some of the finest stone carvings and terra cotta figures. They are well preserved to this day. The presence of a ‘vahalkada’ or front piece is another interesting feature in this chaitya. 
There are carvings of animal figures, pot and foliage and other familiar ornamental motifs. These front pieces seen in most dagobas project from the base and face the cardinal points.

==Vatadage==
{{main|Vatadage}}
[[File:Polonnaruwa Vatadage.jpg|thumb|The Polonnaruwa Vatadage.]]
It can be observed that after the 4th century, the building of colossal dagobas has virtually ended. Thereafter smaller ones have been built using Thuparama in Anuradhapura as a model. This type came to be known as ‘vatadage’ or rotunda. It is a circular relic house and apart from Thuparama and Lankarama in Anuradhapura, the best example is seen in Polonnaruwa. 

There are two other beautiful ones at [[Medirigiriya]] close to Polonnaruwa and Tiriyaya off the Anuradhapura-Trincomalee road. These circular shrines enclosed stupas of smaller size and had wooden pillars right round. Later they were replaced by carved stone pillars. The pillars are arranged in four to two concentric circles, diminishing in size outwards.

==Ancient technology associated with stupas==

It is important to examine the technology applied in the construction of stupas comprising the features mentioned above. Examining the building of the foundation of a stupa to suit its size, one can get an idea of the application of the knowledge of science and geometry prevalent in ancient times. The Jetavana excavations conducted recently confirm that the construction of the platform or base on which a stupa stands has been very solid and strong. The skill shown by the craftsmen in maintaining the shape of the stupa reveals the advanced state of technology prevalent at the time. One wonders how the materials used in building Jetavanaramaya could have been carried to such a height.&lt;ref name="SocialStudies&amp;History" /&gt;

'''Sir Temulji Bhicaji Nariman''' also spelled '''Tehmulji B. Nariman''' (3 September 1848 - August 1940), was a [[Parsi]] [[obstetrician]] from Bombay (now Mumbai), who co-founded one of Bombay's first [[Maternity hospital|Lying-in hospitals]] in 1887 and was knighted in 1914 for his work during the [[List of epidemics|plague epidemic]] in India at the turn of the 19th century.

A graduate of [[Grant Medical College]], he became its Dean and remained active in medical education. He headed the maternity hospital for twenty one years, was awarded the [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal]] in 1909 and became president of the [[College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons of Mumbai|College of Physicians and Surgeons of Bombay]].

==Early life and family==
Temulji B.

'''''The Archaeology of Shamanism''''' is an academic anthology edited by the English archaeologist [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]] which was first published by [[Routledge]] in 2001. Containing fourteen separate papers produced by various scholars working in the disciplines of [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], it looks at the manner in which archaeologists can interpret [[shamanism]] in the archaeological record.

==Background==
The origins of ''The Archaeology of Shamanism'' came from Price's doctoral research, which he undertook at the [[University of York]]'s Department of Archaeology from October 1988 through to May 1992. Under the supervision of the archaeologists Steve Roskams and Richard Hall, Price had initially focused his research on the Anglo-Scandinavian tenements at 16&amp;ndash;22 [[Coppergate]] in York, although eventually moved away from this to focus on archaeology within Scandinavia itself.&lt;ref name="Price 2002 13"&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal circumstances meant that Price was unable to finish his doctoral thesis at York, and in 1992 he emigrated to [[Sweden]], where he spent the following five years working as a field archaeologist. Despite his full-time employment, he continued to be engaged in archaeological research in a private capacity, publishing a series of academic papers and presenting others at conferences. In 1996 joined the Department of Archaeology at the [[University of Uppsala]] as a research scholar, beginning full-time work there the following year. At Uppsala, he went on to complete his doctoral thesis and gain his [[PhD]] under the supervision of Anne-Sofie Gräslund, which would later be published under the title of ''[[The Viking Way (Price book)|The Viking Way: Religion and War in Late Iron Age Scandinavia]]''.&lt;ref name="Price 2002 14"&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In undertaking research for his doctoral thesis, Price took great interest in circumpolar shamanism, attending academic conferences on this subject and reading much published material that had been produced by anthropologists. He found that much of the data which he collected in this area was ultimately of little use for his thesis, and so he included it in an edited anthology which he put together entitled ''The Archaeology of Shamanism'' (2001).&lt;ref name="Price 2002 17"&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter thirteen, "An ideology of transformation: Cremation rites and animal sacrifice in early Anglo-Saxon England", is provided by Howard Williams, then a Lecturer in Archaeology at [[Trinity College, Carmarthen]] in Wales. Devoted to a discussion of [[burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England]], it focuses in on the connection between cremation rites and [[animal sacrifice]], highlighting potentially shamanic elements of such religious practices. Following a brief overview of how earlier scholars have approached the study of [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]], the paper then provides an overview for the archaeological crematory and sacrificial evidence from Anglo-Saxon contexts. Looking at animal designs found on some cremation urns, it highlights the recurring image of the horse within such contexts. Drawing from anthropological comparisons, Williams looks at shamanic cultures across Eurasia and North America which have performed animal sacrifice at funerals, before going on to look at evidence from both Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon literary sources, from which he puts forward the possibility that there may have been a shamanic component to Anglo-Saxon pagan religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil01|Williams 2001]]. pp. 195&amp;ndash;212.&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote     = "This book provides important data for understanding shamanism and its interpretation in the archaeological record, but falls short of Price's stated purpose of providing an overview of the field. This shortcoming is not solely due to the Arctic and subArctic focus, but to the conceptual and methodological lacuna arising from the lack of an empirical, etic and cross-culturally derived model of shamanism. The failure to use models derived from cross-cultural studies leaves the various authors floundering for a model from which they can assess their materials."

}}
In his review for the ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal'', Michael Winkelman of [[Arizona State University]] noted that while Price and the other authors "adopt an approach that shamanism can be differentiated from other forms of religious phenomena", he believed that they had failed to explain how they had adopted such an approach to the reader. He furthermore opined that the work suffers from "an inability to determine just what constitutes a shaman"  and how shamanism was "distinct from other magico-religious practices." Believing that the work could have been improved by a greater examination of the [[neurobiology]] behind shamanic [[altered states of consciousness]], he notes that this was an issue which was only dealt with by J.D. Lewis-Williams in his paper. Regarding the ethnographic chapters, he remarks that they suffer from "the problem of cross-cultural reference", failing to understand the socio-cultural evolution of magico-religious practitioners, assuming that contemporary shamans practice in the same way as their historic and prehistoric forebears. Concluding his review, Winkelman accepts the importance of the anthology in illustrating both that "there is a substantial basis for an archaeology of shamanism" and that "shamanic frameworks are essential for accurate interpretation of prehistory." Despite this, he laments that the book's lack of a well defined conceptual framework is indicative that the archaeology of shamanism is still in its "infancy".&lt;ref name="Winkelman 2002"&gt;[[#Win02|Winkelman 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Fatima Mansions''' were an [[art rock]] [[musical ensemble|group]] formed in 1988 by [[Cork (city)|Cork]] [[singing|singer]]/[[keyboardist]] [[Cathal Coughlan (singer)|Cathal Coughlan]], formerly of [[Microdisney]]. The original line-up consisted of Coughlan, along with Nick Allum, Jonathan Fell, Zac Woolhouse and Aindrias O'Gruama. They took their name from the [[Fatima Mansions (housing)|Fatima Mansions]] corporation flats in [[Rialto (Dublin)|Rialto, Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fatimagroupsunited.com/html/fatima_mansions.html History of Fatima Mansions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020112455/http://www.fatimagroupsunited.com/html/fatima_mansions.html |date=20 October 2008 }}", Fatima Groups Unlimited, retrieved 10 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Strong, Martin C.

The [[single (music)|single]] was a [[A-side and B-side|double A-side]]; the flip-track, [[Manic Street Preachers]]' version of "[[Suicide Is Painless]]" received most of the [[radio station|radio]] [[airplay (radio)|airplay]].
They also gained mainstream exposure by opening a European leg of [[U2]]'s [[Zoo TV Tour]] in 1992, although they were nearly booed off the stage and almost started a riot when front man Coughlan swore at a Milan audience and insulted the Pope.&lt;ref name ="Stephenson"&gt;Stephenson, Campbell (2004) "[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/the10/story/0,11109,1280949,00.html The 10: Campbell Stevenson on stage disasters]", ''[[The Observer]]'', 15 August 2004, retrieved 10 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The band often courted controversy with religion, dictators, empires and general authority being targets for Coughlan's vitriol. Despite this, [[The Guardian]] newspaper described him as "the most underrated lyricist in pop today", and DJ [[John Peel]] said he could "listen to Cathal Coughlan sing the phone book".

The album and singles campaign for 1995's ''Lost in the Former West'' was styled on the glamour of [[Liberace]], and featured a [[cover version]] of [[The Walker Brothers]]'s "Nite Flights".

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], a '''''votum''''', plural '''''vota''''', is a vow or promise made to [[List of Roman deities|a deity]]. The word comes from the [[past participle]] of the [[Latin verb]] ''voveo, vovere'', "vow, promise". As the result of this verbal action, a ''votum'' is also that which fulfills a vow, that is, the thing promised, such as offerings, a statue, or even a temple building. The ''votum'' is thus an aspect of the contractual nature of Roman religion, a bargaining expressed by ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#do ut des|do ut des]]'', "I give that you might give."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors", in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 270; [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), pp. 200–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private ''vota''==
[[File:Silvanus statue Xanten cropped.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Votive statue for the god [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]]; the inscription ends with the abbreviation V.S.L.M. ''(votum solvit libens merito)'']]
In everyday life, individuals might make [[votive offering]]s to a deity for private concerns. ''Vota [[Privatus|privata]]'' are attested in abundance by [[epigraphy|inscriptions]], particularly for the later [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]]. These are regularly marked with the letters V.S.L.M., ''votum solvit libens merito'', noting that the person making the dedication "He has fulfilled his vow, willingly, as it should." [[William Warde Fowler]] found in these offerings "expressions of … religious feeling" and a gratitude for blessings received that go deeper than contractual formalism.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Religious Experience'', pp. 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military ''vota''==
During the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], the ''votum'' was a regular part of ceremonies conducted at the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitoline]] by a general holding ''[[imperium]]'' before deploying.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman triumph|triumph]] with its dedication of spoils and animal sacrifices at the Capitol was in part a fulfillment of such a vow.&lt;ref&gt;Friederike Fless and Katja Moede, "Music and Dance: Forms of Representation in Pictorial and Written Sources", in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 259–260.&lt;/ref&gt; A general who faced an uncertain outcome in battle might make a ''votum'' in the field promising to build a temple out of gratitude for divine aid in a victory. In 311 BC, [[Gaius Junius Bubulcus Brutus|Junius Bubulcus]] became the first [[plebs|plebeian]] general to vow and oversee the building of a temple; he honored the goddess Salus, "Salvation".&lt;ref&gt;Anna Clark, ''Divine Qualities: Cult and Community in Republican Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 50; Richard D. Weigel, "Roman Generals and the Vowing of Temples, 500–100 B.C.", ''[[Classica et Mediaevalia]]'' (Museum Tusculanum Press, 1998), p. 122; Eric M. Orlin, ''Temples, Religion, and Politics in the Roman Republic'' (Brill, 1997), pp. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt; A vow would also be made in connection with the ritual of ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#evocatio|evocatio]]'', negotiations with the enemy's [[tutelary deity]] to offer superior [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|cult]]. An extreme form of ''votum'' was the ''[[devotio]]'', the ritual by which a general sacrificed himself in battle and asked the [[chthonic|chthonic deities]] to take the enemy as offerings along with him.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Religious Experience'', pp. 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public ''vota''==
In the Republic, ''vota pro salute rei publicae'' ("vows for the security of the republic") were offered at the beginning of the year, on the day the [[Roman consul|consuls]] took office.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Hickson-Hahn, "The Politics of Thanksgiving", in ''Augusto augurio: rerum humanarum et divinarum commentationes in honorem Jerzy Linderski'' (Franz Steiner, 2004), pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Empire, [[SPQR|the people]] assembled on January 3 to offer collective vows for the ''salus'' ("health, safety, wellbeing") of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Herz, "Emperors: Caring for the Empire and Their Successors", in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 312; Fowler, ''Religious Experience'', p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Offerings were made to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Salus]], and sometimes [[List of Roman deities|other deities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Rufus Fears]], "The Cult of Jupiter and Roman Imperial Ideology", ''Aufstieg und Nierdergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; These vows originated in 30 BC, when the senate decreed ''vota'' on behalf of Octavian (later [[Augustus]]) as ''[[princeps]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fishwick, ''The Imperial Cult in the Latin West'' (Brill, 1987), vol. I,1, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''vota'' for the state continued on January 1, while those on behalf of the emperor and his family became fixed on January 3. In Rome, these ceremonies were conducted by the consuls and [[College of Pontiffs|pontiffs]], and in the [[Roman province|provinces]] probably by [[Roman governor|governors]] and local priests and officials.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, ''The Imperial Cult in the Latin West'', pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vota publica'' continued even after Christianity had become the official religion of the Empire, and possibly as late as the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Graf, "Roman Festivals in Syria Palaestina", in ''The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman Culture'' (Mohr Siebeck, 2002), vol. 3, p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the vows were as much affirmations of political loyalty as religious expressions, they were difficult to abolish without undermining the sacral aura of the emperor's authority.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Jupiter and Roman Imperial Ideology", pp. 99–105, 119–122. Fears explores the question through the transition from the cult of Jupiter to that of the [[Christian god]]: "Appropriating the central role of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in the theology of victory, the Christian god passed easily into his pre-eminent position in the imperial ideology of the Christian Empire. … Like the theology of victory, the theme of the royal office as an ''[[imitatio Dei]]'' was easily Christianized. … It is precisely in this association of emperor with the high god that we observe most clearly that continuity between pagan and Christian imperial ideology" (pp. 121–122).&lt;/ref&gt;
