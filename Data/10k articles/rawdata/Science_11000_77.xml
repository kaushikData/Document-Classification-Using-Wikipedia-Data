In 2002, he and undergraduate student Louis Poirier transmitted [[faster-than-light]] electrical pulses through a 120-metre long "[[photonic crystal]]" made of [[coaxial cable]]s of alternating [[characteristic impedance]] (12 pairs of 50&amp;nbsp;[[ohm|Ω]] and 75&amp;nbsp;Ω cables).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment showed that the pulse envelope was recreated at the end of the cables at a speed of &gt;3&amp;nbsp;[[speed of light|''c'']]. Since this speed represents the [[group velocity]] but not the [[signal velocity]], no energy or information was actually traveling faster than light.

&lt;br /&gt;a) Misinterpreted [[Regression to the mean|natural course]] – the individual gets better without treatment.
&lt;br /&gt;b) [[Placebo|Placebo effect]] or false treatment effect – an individual receives "alternative therapy" and is convinced it will help. The conviction makes them more likely to get better.
&lt;br /&gt;c) [[Nocebo]] effect – an individual is convinced that standard treatment will not work, and that alternative treatment will work. This decreases the likelihood standard treatment will work, while the placebo effect of the "alternative" remains. 
&lt;br /&gt;d) No adverse effects — Standard treatment is replaced with "alternative" treatment, getting rid of adverse effects, but also of improvement.
&lt;br /&gt; e) Interference — Standard treatment is "complemented" with something that interferes with its effect. This can both cause worse effect, but also decreased (or even increased) side effects, which may be interpreted as "helping".
&lt;br /&gt;Researchers such as [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]], [[clinical statistician]]s and [[pharmacology|pharmacologist]]s use [[clinical trial]]s to tease out such effects, allowing doctors to offer only that which has been shown to work. "Alternative treatments" often refuse to use trials or make it deliberately hard to do so.

'''Alternative medicine''', '''fringe medicine''', '''pseudomedicine''' or simply '''questionable medicine''' is the use and promotion of practices which are unproven, disproven, impossible to prove, or excessively harmful in relation to their effect — in the attempt to achieve the [[healing]] effects of [[medicine]].&lt;!--{{refn|name=Harrisonquote|group=n}}{{refn|name=NSFquote|group=n|}}{{refn|name=Angellquote|group=n}}--&gt;&lt;!--{{refn|group=n|According to the Tzu Chi Institute, a Canadian centre established to evaluate complementary and alternative therapies, "alternative therapies are those lacking scientific validation that are excluded from medical school training programs and uninsured by health plans."&lt;ref name=IGPIAMAYP/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=ATRAMM/&gt;&lt;ref name=NSF_2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Angell1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=NP/&gt;--&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th" /&gt; --&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1019807158|title=More harm than good? : the moral maze of complementary and alternative medicine|last=(Edzard)|first=Ernst, E.|publisher=|others=Smith, Kevin|year=|isbn=9783319699417|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=18|oclc=1019807158}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; They differ from [[experimental medicine]] in that the latter employs [[Clinical trial|responsible investigation]], and accepts results that show it to be ineffective.&lt;!--Consumer health, page 133 --&gt; The [[scientific consensus]] is that alternative therapies either do not, or cannot, work. In some cases [[Scientific law|laws of nature]] are violated by their basic claims; in some the treatment is so much worse that its use is [[medical ethics|unethical]].&lt;!--Clarification, for those that cannot work see homeopathy, which does not abide by the laws of physics--&gt; Alternative practices, products, and therapies range from only ineffective to having known harmful and [[Toxicity|toxic]] effects.&lt;!--{{refn|group=n|name=IOMquote}}&lt;ref name=ATRAMM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hines_Sampson_Coulter_Sagan/&gt;&lt;ref name="CAM_Sointu_Nissen_Eisenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DaguptaHStabler2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=FDA_regulatory/&gt;--&gt;  &lt;!--Edzard Enrst meta-analysis--&gt;

Alternative medicine is used by a significant number of people, though its popularity is often overstated.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;--&gt; Large amounts of funding go to testing alternative medicine, with more than US$2.5 [[billion]] spent by the United States government alone.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31190909/ |title=$2.5 billion spent, no alternative cures found|date=2009-06-10|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Almost none show any effect beyond that of [[Placebo|false treatment]],&lt;!--&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Abdulla1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abdulla|first1=Sara|title=Phytotherapy – good science or big business?|journal=Nature|date=May 13, 1999|doi=10.1038/news990513-8|quote=Science-based medicine, with its emphasis on controlled study, proof, evidence, statistical significance and safety is being rejected in favour of 'alternative medicine'&amp;nbsp;– an atavistic portmanteau of anecdote, hearsay, rumour and hokum....

This fact is often overlooked by media or intentionally kept hidden, with alternative practice being portrayed positively when compared to [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory|"big pharma"]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th" /&gt; --&gt; The lobby has successfully pushed for alternative therapies to be subject to far less regulation than conventional medicine.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th" /&gt;--&gt; Alternative therapies may even be allowed to promote use when there is demonstrably no effect, only a tradition of use. Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine and [[health care provider]]s varies between and within countries. Despite laws making it illegal to market or promote alternative therapies for use in cancer treatment, many practitioners promote them.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative/|title=Complementary and alternative therapies – Cancer in general |publisher= Cancer Research UK|website=www.cancerresearchuk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/OurServices/ServiceA-Z/INTMED/IMCAN/Pages/Home.aspx|title=Complementary cancer care service|website=www.uclh.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Alternative medicine is criticized for taking advantage of the weakest members of society.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;--&gt;

=== Alternative medicine ===
'''Alternative medicine''' is defined loosely as a set of products, practices, and theories that are believed or perceived by their users to have the healing effects of [[medicine]],{{refn|name=NSFquote|group=n|"[A]lternative medicine refers to all treatments that have not been proven effective using scientific methods."&lt;ref name=NSF_2002/&gt;}}{{refn|"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a broad domain of resources that encompasses health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes such resources perceived by their users as associated with positive health outcomes. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and the domain of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed."{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=19}}|name=IOMquote|group=n}} but whose [[efficacy|effectiveness]] has not been clearly established using [[scientific method]]s,{{refn|name=NSFquote|group=n}}{{refn|name=Angellquote|group=n|"It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride.

There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work... speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence."&lt;ref name=Angell1998/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines_Sampson_Coulter_Sagan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGPIAMAYP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NP" /&gt; or whose theory and practice is not part of [[biomedicine]],{{refn|group=n|name=IOMquote}}{{refn|group=n|name=Harrisonquote |"The phrase complementary and alternative medicine is used to describe a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that have historic origins outside mainstream medicine. Most of these practices are used together with conventional therapies and therefore have been called complementary to distinguish them from alternative practices, those used as a substitute for standard care. ... Until a decade ago or so, "complementary and alternative medicine" could be defined as practices that are neither taught in medical schools nor reimbursed, but this definition is no longer workable, since medical students increasingly seek and receive some instruction about complementary health practices, and some practices are reimbursed by third-party payers.

In ''General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine'', published in 2000 by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), complementary and alternative medicine were defined as a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system.&lt;ref name="WHO_Trad_Med_Defs" /&gt;{{sfn|WHO|2000}}

The expression also refers to a diverse range of related and unrelated products, practices, and theories ranging from biologically plausible practices and products and practices with some evidence, to practices and theories that are directly contradicted by basic science or clear evidence, and products that have been conclusively proven to be ineffective or even toxic and harmful.{{refn|group=n|name=IOMquote}}&lt;ref name="CAM_Sointu_Nissen_Eisenberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DaguptaHStabler2011" /&gt;

The terms ''alternative medicine'', ''complementary medicine'', ''integrative medicine,'' ''holistic medicine'', ''natural medicine'', ''unorthodox medicine'', ''fringe medicine'', ''unconventional medicine'', and ''[[new age]] medicine'' are used interchangeably as having the same meaning and are almost synonymous in most contexts.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 08"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ib_IbOu_d9gC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1|title=Suckers: How Alternative Medicine Makes Fools of Us All|last=Shapiro|first=Rose|date=2010-09-30|publisher=Random House |isbn=9781409059165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bombardieri2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shuval2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman2011" /&gt;

=== Complementary or integrative medicine {{anchor|Complementary medicine|Integrative medicine|Integrated medicine}} ===

==="Allopathic medicine"===
{{main|Allopathic medicine}}
''Allopathic medicine'' or ''allopathy'' is an expression commonly used by [[Homeopathy|homeopaths]] and proponents of other forms of alternative medicine to refer to [[medicine|mainstream medicine]]. It was used to describe the traditional European practice of [[heroic medicine]],&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/758098687|title=Consumer health : a guide to intelligent decisions|last1=Barrett|first1=Stephen|last2=London|first2=William M.|last3=Kroger|first3=Manfred|last4=Hall|first4=Harriet|last5=Baratz|first5=Robert S.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2013|isbn=9780078028489|edition=9th|location=New York|pages=34–35, 134, 137|oclc=758098687}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later continued to be used to describe anything that was not homeopathy.&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;

Allopathy refers to the use of pharmacologically active [[Active ingredient|agents]] or [[Surgery|physical interventions]] to treat or suppress [[symptoms]] or [[pathophysiology|pathophysiologic]] processes of diseases or conditions.&lt;ref name="FREEDICT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/allopathy |website=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |title=Definition {{ndash}} allopathy |accessdate=25 October 2013}} Citing: ''Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine'' (2008) and ''Mosby's Medical Dictionary'', 8th ed.

===CAM===
CAM is an abbreviation of complementary and alternative medicine.&lt;ref name="ernstinterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CassilethDeng2004" /&gt; It has also been called sCAM or SCAM with the addition of "so-called" or "supplements".&lt;ref name="skepdic.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyreman 209–17"/&gt; The words balance and holism are often used, claiming to take into account a "whole" person, in contrast to the supposed reductionism of medicine. Due to its many names the field has been criticized for intense [[rebranding]] of what are essentially the same practices: as soon as one name is declared synonymous with [[quackery]], a new name is chosen.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 08" /&gt;

===Traditional medicine===
{{main|Traditional medicine}}
'''Traditional medicine''' refers to the pre-scientific practices of a certain culture, contrary to what is typically practiced in other cultures where medical science dominates.

"[[Eastern medicine]]" typically refers to the traditional medicines of Asia where conventional bio-medicine penetrated much later.

=== Holistic medicine ===

The words ''balance'' and ''holism'' are often used alongside ''complementary'' or ''integrative'' medicine, claiming to take into account a "whole" person, in contrast to the supposed reductionism of medicine. Due to its many names the field has been criticized for intense [[rebranding]] of what are essentially the same practices.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 08" /&gt;

=== Problems with definition ===

Prominent members of the science&lt;ref name="Offit2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins2003a" /&gt; and biomedical science community&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt; say that it is not meaningful to define an alternative medicine that is separate from a conventional medicine, that the expressions "conventional medicine", "alternative medicine", "complementary medicine", "integrative medicine",  and "holistic medicine" do not refer to any medicine at all.&lt;ref name="Offit2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins2003a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fontanarosa1998" /&gt;

Others in both the biomedical and CAM communities say that CAM ''cannot'' be precisely defined because of the diversity of theories and practices it includes, and because the boundaries between CAM and biomedicine overlap, are porous, and change.{{sfn|Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|2015|loc=chpt. 14-E|p=1}}{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=14–20}} The expression "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) resists easy definition because the health systems and practices it refers to are diffuse, and its boundaries poorly defined.&lt;ref name="CAM_Sointu_Nissen_Eisenberg" /&gt;{{sfn|Ruggie|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ViDwi7s2VvMC&amp;pg=PA20 20]}}{{refn|group=n|Mary Ruggie in Chapter 2 of ''Marginal to Mainstream: Alternative Medicine in America'' said, "By the mid-1990s, the notion that some alternative therapies could be complementary to conventional medicine began to change the status of...alternative medicine. The 21st century is witnessing yet another terminological innovation, in which CAM and conventional medicine are becoming integrative."{{sfn|Ruggie|2004}}}} Healthcare practices categorized as alternative may differ in their historical origin, theoretical basis, [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic technique]], [[therapy|therapeutic practice]] and in their relationship to the medical mainstream.{{sfn|Sointu|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XC2UUP36bjAC&amp;pg=PA13 13]}} Some alternative therapies, including [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)]] and [[Ayurveda]], have antique origins in East or South Asia and are entirely alternative medical systems;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sointu|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XC2UUP36bjAC&amp;pg=PA13 13]}}. {{harvnb |IOM Report |2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=18 18]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; others, such as homeopathy and chiropractic, have origins in Europe or the United States and emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.{{sfn |Gevitz |1997 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZIqk31BXpksC&amp;pg=PA603 603–33]}} Some, such as [[osteopathy]] and chiropractic, employ manipulative physical methods of treatment; others, such as [[meditation]] and [[prayer]], are based on [[mind-body intervention]]s.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=18 18]}} Treatments considered alternative in one location may be considered conventional in another.&lt;ref name="Nissen2013" /&gt; Thus, chiropractic is not considered alternative in Denmark and likewise [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]] is no longer thought of as an alternative therapy in the United States.&lt;ref name="Nissen2013" /&gt;

Critics say the expression is deceptive because it implies there is an effective alternative to science-based medicine, and that ''complementary'' is deceptive because it implies that the treatment increases the effectiveness of (complements) science-based medicine, while alternative medicines that have been tested nearly always have no measurable positive effect compared to a [[placebo]].&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skep_Dic_comp_med" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Novella2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorski2010" /&gt;

===Different types of definitions===
One common feature of all definitions of alternative medicine is its designation as "other than" conventional medicine.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=14 14]}} For example, the widely referenced{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=19 19]}} descriptive definition of complementary and alternative medicine devised by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|US National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)]] of the [[National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health (NIH)]], states that it is "a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine".&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt; For conventional medical practitioners, it does not necessarily follow that either it or its practitioners would no longer be considered alternative.{{refn|group=n|As David J. Hufford, Professor and Director at the Doctors Kienle Center for Humanistic Medicine at the [[Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center|Penn State College of Medicine]],&lt;ref name=HuffordUPenn/&gt; has argued: "Simply because an herbal remedy comes to be used by physicians does not mean that herbalists cease to practice, or that the practice of the one becomes like that of the other."&lt;ref name=Hufford2004a/&gt;}}

Some definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare.&lt;ref name="Saks1992" /&gt; This can refer to the lack of support that alternative therapies receive from the medical establishment and related bodies regarding access to [[Medical research#Funding|research funding]], sympathetic coverage in the [[Medical literature|medical press]], or inclusion in the standard [[Medical education|medical curriculum]].&lt;ref name="Saks1992" /&gt; In 1993, the [[British Medical Association|British Medical Association (BMA)]], one among many professional organizations who have attempted to define alternative medicine, stated that it{{refn|group=n|The BMA used the term non-conventional medicine instead of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=BMA_1993_1st/&gt;}} referred to "...those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the conventional healthcare professions, and the skills of which are not taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of conventional medical and paramedical healthcare courses".&lt;ref name="BMA_1993_1st" /&gt; In a US context, an influential definition coined in 1993 by the Harvard-based physician,&lt;ref name="Artus2007" /&gt; David M. Eisenberg,&lt;ref name="Eisenberg_Bio" /&gt; characterized alternative medicine "as interventions neither taught widely in medical schools nor generally available in US hospitals".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenberg et al.|1993}}. {{harvnb|Eisenberg et al.|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptive definitions are inadequate in the present-day when some conventional doctors offer alternative medical treatments and CAM introductory courses or modules can be offered as part of standard undergraduate medical training;&lt;ref name="HOL_Kopelman_Wieland_Astin_Pelletier" /&gt; alternative medicine is taught in more than 50 per cent of [[Medical school in the United States|US medical schools]] and increasingly [[Health insurance in the United States|US health insurers]] are willing to provide reimbursement for CAM therapies.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=17 17], [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=196 196–252]}} In 1999, 7.7% of US hospitals reported using some form of CAM therapy; this proportion had risen to 37.7% by 2008.&lt;ref name="Salomonsen_AHA" /&gt;

An expert panel at a conference hosted in 1995 by the US Office for Alternative Medicine (OAM),&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt;{{refn|group=n|The Office for Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, was renamed NCCAM in 1998.&lt;ref name=FDA_regulatory/&gt;}} devised a [[theoretical definition]]&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt; of alternative medicine as "a broad domain of healing resources&amp;nbsp;... other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period".&lt;ref name="CAM_RMC1997" /&gt; This definition has been widely adopted by CAM researchers,&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt; cited by official government bodies such as the UK Department of Health,&lt;ref name="UKDoH_CAM" /&gt; attributed as the definition used by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]],&lt;ref name="ZollChanCoulRobeAdamArtu" /&gt; and, with some modification,{{dubious|date=June 2015}} was preferred in the 2005 consensus report of the [[Institute of Medicine|US Institute of Medicine]], ''Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States''.{{refn|group=n|name=IOMquote}}

The 1995 OAM conference definition, an expansion of Eisenberg's 1993 formulation, is silent regarding questions of the medical effectiveness of alternative therapies.&lt;ref name="Hufford2004" /&gt; Its proponents hold that it thus avoids [[relativism]] about differing forms of medical knowledge and, while it is an essentially political definition, this should not imply that the dominance of mainstream [[biomedicine]] is solely due to political forces.&lt;ref name="Hufford2004" /&gt; According to this definition, alternative and [[medicine|mainstream medicine]] can only be differentiated with reference to what is "intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society of culture".&lt;ref name="Kopelman2004" /&gt; However, there is neither a reliable method to distinguish between cultures and [[subculture]]s, nor to attribute them as dominant or subordinate, nor any accepted criteria to determine the dominance of a cultural entity.&lt;ref name="Kopelman2004" /&gt; If the culture of a politically dominant healthcare system is held to be equivalent to the perspectives of those charged with the medical management of leading healthcare institutions and programs, the definition fails to recognize the potential for division either within such an elite or between a healthcare elite and the wider population.&lt;ref name="Kopelman2004" /&gt;

[[Normative]] definitions distinguish alternative medicine from the biomedical mainstream in its provision of therapies that are unproven, unvalidated, or ineffective and support of theories with no recognized scientific basis.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=17 17]}} These definitions characterize practices as constituting alternative medicine when, used independently or in place of [[evidence-based medicine]], they are put forward as having the healing effects of medicine, but are not based on [[evidence]] gathered with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCI_PDQ_CAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Borkan2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kong2005" /&gt; Exemplifying this perspective, a 1998 editorial co-authored by [[Marcia Angell]], a former editor of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine&amp;nbsp;– conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments.&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, the public information website maintained by the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) of the Commonwealth of Australia uses the acronym "CAM" for a wide range of health care practices, therapies, procedures and devices not within the domain of conventional medicine. In the Australian context this is stated to include acupuncture; aromatherapy; chiropractic; homeopathy; massage; meditation and relaxation therapies; naturopathy; osteopathy; reflexology, traditional Chinese medicine; and the use of vitamin supplements.&lt;ref name="NHMRC_CAM" /&gt;

The [[National Board of Health (Denmark)|Danish National Board of Health's]] "Council for Alternative Medicine" (Sundhedsstyrelsens Råd for Alternativ Behandling (SRAB)), an independent institution under the National Board of Health (Danish: ''Sundhedsstyrelsen''), uses the term "alternative medicine" for:
* Treatments performed by therapists that are not authorized healthcare professionals.
* Treatments performed by authorized healthcare professionals, but those based on methods otherwise used mainly outside the healthcare system. People without a healthcare authorisation are [also] allowed to perform the treatments.&lt;ref name="VIFAB_definition" /&gt;

Alternative medicine consists of a wide range of health care practices, products, and therapies. The shared feature is a claim to heal that is not based on the scientific method. Alternative medicine practices are diverse in their foundations and methodologies.&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt; Alternative medicine practices may be classified by their cultural origins or by the types of beliefs upon which they are based.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMCER" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt; Methods may incorporate or be based on traditional medicinal practices of a particular culture, folk knowledge, superstition,{{sfn|O'Connor|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JXFPb88KLZQC&amp;pg=PA2 2]}} spiritual beliefs, belief in [[supernatural]] energies ([[antiscience]]), [[pseudoscience]], [[fallacy|errors in reasoning]], propaganda, fraud, new or different concepts of health and disease, and any bases other than being proven by scientific methods.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines_Sampson_Coulter_Sagan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMCER" /&gt; Different cultures may have their own unique traditional or belief based practices developed recently or over thousands of years, and specific practices or entire systems of practices.

Alternative medical systems may be based on [[traditional medicine]] practices, such as [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM), [[Ayurveda]] in India, or practices of other cultures around the world.&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt; Some useful applications of traditional medicines have been researched and accepted within ordinary medicine, however the underlying belief systems are seldom scientific and are not accepted.

Traditional medicine is considered alternative when it is used outside its home region; or when it is used together with or instead of known functional treatment; or when it can be reasonably expected that the patient or practitioner knows or should know that it will not work – such as knowing that the practice is based on superstition.

Since ancient times, in many parts of the world a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in [[folk medicine]]. Among these are: [[tansy]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[black cohosh]], and the now-extinct [[silphium]].&lt;ref name="riddle2"&gt;{{Cite book|first=John M. |last=Riddle |title=Eve's herbs: a history of contraception and abortion in the West |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |year=1997|isbn=9780674270244 |oclc=36126503}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44–47, 62–63, 154–55, 230–31}} Historian of science [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] has written of the probable [[Protoscience|protoscientific]] origins of this folk knowledge in observation of farm animals.  Women who knew that grazing on certain plants would cause an animal to abort (with negative economic consequences for the farm) would be likely to try out those plants on themselves in order to avoid an unwanted pregnancy.&lt;ref name="ahk"&gt;{{cite book | last=Koblitz | first=Ann Hibner | title=Sex and Herbs and Birth Control: Women and Fertility Regulation Through the Ages | publisher=Kovalevskaia Fund | year=2014 | isbn=9780989665506}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120}}

However, modern users of these plants often lack knowledge of the proper preparation and dosage.  The historian of medicine [[John M. Riddle|John Riddle]] has spoken of the "broken chain of knowledge" caused by urbanization and modernization,&lt;ref name="riddle2" /&gt;{{rp|167–205}} and Koblitz has written that "folk knowledge about effective contraception techniques often disappears over time or becomes inextricably mixed with useless or harmful practices."&lt;ref name="ahk" /&gt;{{rp|vii}}  The ill-informed or indiscriminant use of herbs as abortifacients can cause serious and even lethal side-effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Sullivan | first1=John B. | last2=et al. | title=Pennyroyal oil poisoning and hepatoxicity | journal=Journal of the American Medical Association | year=1979|volume=242|issue=26|pages=2873–74|doi=10.1001/jama.1979.03300260043027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ciganda C, Laborde A |title=Herbal infusions used for induced abortion |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=235–39 |year=2003 |pmid=12807304 |doi=10.1081/CLT-120021104 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|The practices are based on belief in a supernatural energy called [[qi]], considerations of [[Chinese astrology|Chinese Astrology]] and [[Numerology#Chinese numerology|Chinese numerology]], traditional use of herbs and other substances found in China&amp;nbsp;– a belief that the tongue contains a map of the body that reflects changes in the body, and an incorrect model of the anatomy and physiology of internal organs.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BeyersteinSampson1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LuNeedham1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maciocia1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matuk2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deshpande1987" /&gt;

|[[Ayurveda]]
|Traditional medicine of India. Ayurveda believes in the existence of three elemental substances, the [[Ayurveda#Tridosha system|doshas]] (called Vata, Pitta and Kapha), and states that a balance of the doshas results in health, while imbalance results in disease. Such disease-inducing imbalances can be adjusted and balanced using traditional herbs, minerals and heavy metals. Ayurveda stresses the use of plant-based medicines and treatments, with some animal products, and added minerals, including [[sulfur]], [[arsenic]], [[lead]] and [[copper sulfate]]{{Clarify|date=October 2017}}.
|Safety concerns have been raised about Ayurveda, with two U.S. studies finding about 20 percent of Ayurvedic Indian-manufactured [[patent medicine]]s contained toxic levels of heavy metals such as [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[arsenic]]. A 2015 study of users in the United States also found elevated blood lead levels in 40 percent of those tested.  Other concerns include the use of herbs containing toxic compounds and the lack of quality control in Ayurvedic facilities. Incidents of [[heavy metal poisoning]] have been attributed to the use of these compounds in the United States.{{sfn|Wujastyk|2003|p=xviii}}{{sfn|Mishra|2004|p=8}}&lt;ref name="DaguptaHStabler2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Valiathan2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saper2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Harriet|title=Ayurveda: Ancient Superstition, Not Ancient Wisdom|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/ayurveda_ancient_superstition_not_ancient_wisdom|website=Skeptical Inquirer|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breeher L, Mikulski MA, Czeczok T, Leinenkugel K, Fuortes LJ|title=A cluster of lead poisoning among consumers of Ayurvedic medicine|journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health|date=6 Apr 2015|volume=4|issue=4|pages=303–07|doi=10.1179/2049396715Y.0000000009|pmid=25843124|pmc=4727589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NCCIH classification ===
A US agency, National Center on Complementary and Integrative Health ([[NCCIH]]), has created a classification system for branches of complementary and alternative medicine that divides them into five major groups. These groups have some overlap, and distinguish  two types of [[energy]] medicine: ''veritable'' which involves scientifically observable energy (including [[magnet therapy]], [[colorpuncture]] and [[light therapy]]) and ''putative'', which invokes physically undetectable or unverifiable energy.&lt;ref name="NCCIH_EMed" /&gt; None of these energies have any evidence to support that they effect the body in any positive or health promoting way.&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;

# Whole medical systems: Cut across more than one of the other groups; examples include traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathy, homeopathy, and ayurveda.
# Mind-body interventions: Explore the interconnection between the mind, body, and spirit, under the premise that they affect "bodily functions and symptoms". A connection between mind and body is conventional medical fact, and this classification does not include therapies with proven function such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].
# "Biology"-based practices: Use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, vitamins, and other natural substances. (Note that as used here, "biology" does ''not'' refer to the science of [[biology]], but is a usage newly coined by NCCIH in the primary source used for this article. "Biology-based" as coined by NCCIH may refer to chemicals from a nonbiological source, such as use of the poison [[lead]] in traditional Chinese medicine, and to other nonbiological substances.)
# Manipulative and body-based practices: feature manipulation or movement of body parts, such as is done in bodywork, chiropractic, and osteopathic manipulation.
# Energy medicine: is a domain that deals with putative and verifiable energy fields:
#* [[Energy (spirituality)#Biofields|Biofield]] therapies are intended to influence energy fields that are purported to surround and penetrate the body. The existence of such energy fields have been disproven.
#* [[Bioelectromagnetism|Bioelectromagnetic]]-based therapies use verifiable electromagnetic fields, such as pulsed fields, alternating-current, or direct-current fields in an non-scientific manner.

=== Medical education ===
Mainly as a result of reforms following the Flexner Report of 1910&lt;ref name="Flexner_Report" /&gt; [[medical education]] in established [[medical schools]] in the US has generally not included alternative medicine as a teaching topic.{{refn|group=n|As the medical professor [[Kenneth Ludmerer|Kenneth M. Ludmerer]] noted in 2010: "Flexner pointed out that the scientific method of thinking applied to medical practice. By scientific method, he meant testing ideas with well-planned experiments to establish accurate facts. The clinician's diagnosis was equivalent to the scientist's hypothesis: both [[medical diagnosis]] and hypothesis required the test of an experiment. Flexner argued that mastery of the scientific method of problem solving was the key for physicians to manage medical uncertainty and to practice in the most cost-effective way."&lt;ref name=Ludmerer2010/&gt;}} Typically, their teaching is based on current practice and scientific knowledge about: anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology, neuroanatomy, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology and immunology.&lt;ref name="Bianco" /&gt; Medical schools' teaching includes such topics as doctor-patient communication, ethics, the art of medicine,&lt;ref name="Stanford_Curriculum" /&gt; and engaging in complex clinical reasoning (medical decision-making).&lt;ref name="Yale_Curriculum" /&gt; Writing in 2002, Snyderman and Weil remarked that by the early twentieth century the Flexner model had helped to create the 20th-century academic health center, in which education, research, and practice were inseparable. While this had much improved medical practice by defining with increasing certainty the [[pathophysiological]] basis of disease, a single-minded focus on the pathophysiological had diverted much of mainstream American medicine from clinical conditions that were not well understood in mechanistic terms, and were not effectively treated by conventional therapies.&lt;ref name="Snyderman2002" /&gt;

By 2001 some form of CAM training was being offered by at least 75 out of 125 medical schools in the US.&lt;ref name="Berman2001" /&gt; Exceptionally, the School of Medicine of the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]] includes a research institute for integrative medicine (a member entity of the Cochrane Collaboration).&lt;ref name="UM_CAM_Field" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UM_CIM" /&gt; Medical schools are responsible for conferring medical degrees, but a physician typically may not legally practice medicine until licensed by the local government authority. Licensed [[physicians in the United States|physicians in the US]] who have attended one of the established medical schools there have usually graduated Doctor of Medicine (MD).&lt;ref name="Medline_MD" /&gt; All states require that applicants for MD licensure be graduates of an approved medical school and complete the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)]].&lt;ref name="Medline_MD" /&gt;

== Efficacy ==
There is a general scientific consensus that alternative therapies lack the requisite [[scientific validation]], and their [[efficacy|effectiveness]] is either [[Scientific method|unproved]] or [[Scientific evidence|disproved]].&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldrosen2004" /&gt; Many of the claims regarding the efficacy of alternative medicines are controversial, since research on them is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005}} [[Publication bias|Selective publication bias]], marked differences in product quality and standardisation, and some companies making unsubstantiated claims call into question the claims of efficacy of isolated examples where there is evidence for alternative therapies.&lt;ref name="Sarris2012" /&gt;

''The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine'' points to confusions in the general population&amp;nbsp;– a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwise-ineffective therapy just because they are taking something (the placebo effect); the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness (the [[regression fallacy]]) gets misattributed to an alternative medicine being taken; a person not diagnosed with science-based medicine may never originally have had a true illness diagnosed as an alternative disease category.&lt;ref name="Alcock1999" /&gt;

[[Edzard Ernst]] characterized the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak, nonexistent, or negative&lt;ref name="goodbadugly" /&gt; and in 2011 published his estimate that about 7.4% were based on "sound evidence", although he believes that may be an overestimate.&lt;ref name="Ernst2011" /&gt; Ernst has concluded that 95% of the alternative treatments he and his team studied, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, and reflexology, are "statistically indistinguishable from placebo treatments", but he also believes there is something that conventional doctors can usefully learn from the chiropractors and homeopath: this is the therapeutic value of the placebo effect, one of the strangest phenomena in medicine.&lt;ref name="Economist2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HHH2008" /&gt;

In 2003, a project funded by the CDC identified 208 condition-treatment pairs, of which 58% had been studied by at least one [[randomized controlled trial]] (RCT), and 23% had been assessed with a [[meta-analysis]].&lt;ref name="Katz2003" /&gt; According to a 2005 book by a US [[Institute of Medicine]] panel, the number of RCTs focused on CAM has risen dramatically.

{{as of|2005}}, the [[Cochrane Library]] had 145 CAM-related Cochrane systematic reviews and 340 non-Cochrane systematic reviews. An analysis of the conclusions of only the 145 Cochrane reviews was done by two readers. In 83% of the cases, the readers agreed. In the 17% in which they disagreed, a third reader agreed with one of the initial readers to set a rating. These studies found that, for CAM, 38.4% concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%), 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.7% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded no effect, 8.1% concluded net harmful effects, and 21.3% concluded insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the more developed 2004 Cochrane database, while the conventional review used the initial 1998 Cochrane database.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=135 135–36]}}

In the same way as for conventional therapies, drugs, and interventions, it can be difficult to test the efficacy of alternative medicine in [[clinical trial]]s. In instances where an established, effective, treatment for a condition is already available, the [[Helsinki Declaration]] states that withholding such treatment is unethical in most circumstances. Use of standard-of-care treatment in addition to an alternative technique being tested may produce confounded or difficult-to-interpret results.&lt;ref name="Bodeker2002" /&gt;

Cancer researcher [[Andrew J. Vickers]] has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to much popular and scientific writing, many [[alternative cancer treatments]] have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective. The label "unproven" is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been "disproven".&lt;ref name="Vickers" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==

=== Placebo effect ===
A research methods expert and author of ''Snake Oil Science'', [[R. Barker Bausell]], has stated that "it's become politically correct to investigate nonsense."&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion" /&gt; There are concerns that just having NIH support is being used to give unfounded "legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate."&lt;ref name="Brown2009" /&gt;

Use of placebos to achieve a [[placebo effect]] in integrative medicine has been criticized as, "...diverting research time, money, and other resources from more fruitful lines of investigation in order to pursue a theory that has no basis in biology."&lt;ref name="Novella2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorski2010" /&gt;

Another critic has argued that academic proponents of [[integrative medicine]] sometimes recommend misleading patients by using known placebo treatments to achieve a placebo effect.{{refn|group=n|As a 2010 article in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' concluded: &lt;blockquote&gt;real acupuncture treatments were no more effective than sham acupuncture treatments. There was, nevertheless, evidence that both real acupuncture and sham acupuncture were more effective than no treatment, and that acupuncture can be a useful supplement to other forms of conventional therapy for low back pain.&lt;ref name="Berman2010"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}} However, a 2010 survey of family physicians found that 56% of respondents said they had used a placebo in clinical practice as well. Eighty-five percent of respondents believed placebos can have both psychological and physical benefits.&lt;ref name="Kerman2010" /&gt;

[[Integrative medicine]] has been criticized in that its practitioners, trained in science-based medicine, deliberately mislead patients by pretending [[placebo]]s are not. "[[Quackery#Criticism of quackery in academia|quackademic medicine]]" is a pejorative term used for ''[[integrative medicine]]'', which medical professionals consider an infiltration of quackery into academic [[science-based medicine]].&lt;ref name="Gorski2010" /&gt;

An analysis of trends in the criticism of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in five prestigious American medical journals during the period of reorganization within medicine (1965–1999) was reported as showing that the medical profession had responded to the growth of CAM in three phases, and that in each phase, changes in the medical marketplace had influenced the type of response in the journals.&lt;ref name="Winnick2005_2009" /&gt; Changes included relaxed medical licensing, the development of managed care, rising consumerism, and the establishment of the USA Office of Alternative Medicine (later [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], currently [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]).{{refn|group=n|According to the medical historian [[James Harvey Young]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1991 the Senate Appropriations Committee responsible for funding the National Institutes of Health (NIH) declared itself "not satisfied that the conventional medical community as symbolized at the NIH has fully explored the potential that exists in unconventional medical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Young |first1= J.H. |title= The Development of the Office of Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes of Health, 1991–1996 |doi= 10.1353/bhm.1998.0110 |journal= Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume= 72 |issue= 2 |pages= 279–98 |year= 1998 |pmid=  9628052 |pmc= |ref= harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}} In the "condemnation" phase, from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, authors had ridiculed, exaggerated the risks, and petitioned the state to contain CAM; in the "reassessment" phase (mid-1970s through early 1990s), when increased consumer utilization of CAM was prompting concern, authors had pondered whether patient dissatisfaction and shortcomings in conventional care contributed to the trend; in the "integration" phase of the 1990s physicians began learning to work around or administer CAM, and the subjugation of CAM to scientific scrutiny had become the primary means of control.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Use and regulation==

===Appeal===
[[File:"Miracle Cure!" Health Fraud Scams (8528312890).jpg|thumb|Alternative therapies often make bombastic claims, and frequently include anecdotes from healthy-looking individuals claiming successful treatment.]]

Practitioners of complementary medicine usually discuss and advise patients as to available alternative therapies. Patients often express interest in mind-body complementary therapies because they offer a non-drug approach to treating some health conditions.&lt;ref name="Sobel2000"/&gt;

In addition to the social-cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine, there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth. One of the most critical is the placebo effect&amp;nbsp;– a well-established observation in medicine.&lt;ref name="van_Deventer2008"/&gt;  Related to it are similar psychological effects, such as the will to believe,&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt; [[cognitive bias]]es that help maintain self-esteem and promote harmonious social functioning,&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt; and the ''[[post hoc, ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy.&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt;

====Marketing====
[[File:Edzard ernst.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edzard Ernst]], a leading authority on scientific study of alternative treatments and diagnoses, and the first university professor of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Here in 2012, promoting his book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' co-written with [[Simon Singh]].]]

The popularity of complementary &amp; alternative medicine (CAM) may be related to other factors that [[Edzard Ernst]] mentioned in an interview in ''[[The Independent]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why is it so popular, then? Ernst blames the providers, customers and the doctors whose neglect, he says, has created the opening into which alternative therapists have stepped. "People are told lies. There are 40 million websites and 39.9 million tell lies, sometimes outrageous lies. They mislead cancer patients, who are encouraged not only to pay their last penny but to be treated with something that shortens their lives. "At the same time, people are gullible. It needs gullibility for the industry to succeed. It doesn't make me popular with the public, but it's the truth.&lt;ref name="Con?"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Paul Offit]] proposed that "alternative medicine becomes quackery" in four ways: by recommending against conventional therapies that are helpful, promoting potentially harmful therapies without adequate warning, draining patients' bank accounts, or by promoting "magical thinking."&lt;ref name=Offit2013/&gt;

[[File:Lemon-906141.jpg|thumb|Friendly and colorful images of herbal treatments may look less threatening or dangerous when compared to conventional medicine. This is an intentional marketing strategy.]]

====Social factors====

Authors have speculated on the socio-cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among the minority using them ''in lieu'' of conventional medicine. There are several socio-cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of [[scientific literacy]] among the public at large and a concomitant increase in [[antiscience|antiscientific]] attitudes and [[new age]] [[mysticism]].&lt;ref name="Beyerstein" /&gt; Related to this are vigorous [[marketing]]&lt;ref name="Weber" /&gt; of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt;

There is also an increase in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies, mistrust of traditional authority figures, such as the physician, and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine, all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt; Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine, due to a lack of private or public [[health insurance]], which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine.&lt;ref name="Barnes2004" /&gt; Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market.&lt;ref name="Weber" /&gt;

Patients can be averse to the painful, unpleasant, and sometimes-dangerous [[adverse effect|side effects]] of biomedical treatments. Treatments for severe diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[HIV]] infection have well-known, significant side-effects. Even low-risk medications such as [[antibiotics]] can have potential to cause life-threatening [[anaphylactic]] reactions in a very few individuals. Many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach. In all of these cases, patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt;

===Prevalence of use===

'''Complementary and alternative medicine''' (CAM) has been described as a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well-being. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and that of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed.&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt;{{dubious|date=February 2013}}

According to recent research, the increasing popularity of the CAM needs to be explained by moral convictions or lifestyle choices rather than by economic reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Hélène|last2=Debons|first2=Jérôme|title=CAM and conventional medicine in Switzerland : divided in theory, united in practice. In N. K. Gale &amp; J. V. McHale, Routledge Handbook of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Perspectives from social science and law|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|pages=271–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[developing country|developing nations]], access to essential medicines is severely restricted by lack of resources and [[poverty]]. [[Traditional medicine|Traditional remedies]], often closely resembling or forming the basis for alternative remedies, may comprise primary healthcare or be integrated into the healthcare system. In Africa, traditional medicine is used for 80% of primary healthcare, and in developing nations as a whole over one-third of the population lack access to essential medicines.&lt;ref name="WHO_tradmed_fact" /&gt;

Some have proposed adopting a [[prize]] system to reward medical research.&lt;ref name="Horrobin1986" /&gt; However, public funding for research exists. Increasing the funding for research on alternative medicine techniques is the purpose of the [[US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. NCCIH and its predecessor, the Office of Alternative Medicine, have spent more than US$2.5 billion on such research since 1992; this research has largely not demonstrated the efficacy of alternative treatments.&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nccih_$" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atwood2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2001|title=Stated goals and grants of the Office of Alternative Medicine/National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|url=|journal=Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|volume=5|issue=4|pages=205–07|author=Green S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That alternative medicine has been on the rise "in countries where Western science and scientific method generally are accepted as the major foundations for healthcare, and 'evidence-based' practice is the dominant paradigm" was described as an "enigma" in the Medical Journal of Australia.&lt;ref name="Coulter2004" /&gt;

====In the US====

In the United States, the 1974 [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] (CAPTA) required that for states to receive federal money, they had to grant religious exemptions to [[child neglect]] and [[child abuse|abuse]] laws regarding religion-based healing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merrick |first=Janna | date=June 2003 |title=Spiritual Healing, Sick Kids and the Law: Inequities in the American Healthcare System |journal=American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=269–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-one states have child-abuse religious exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |title=Definitions of Child Abuse and Neglect |accessdate=2009-02-27 |publisher=Child Welfare Information Gateway |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011062659/http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of alternative medicine in the US has increased,&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenberg1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=D.M.|last2=Davis|first2=R.B.|last3=Ettner|first3=S.L.|last4=Appel|first4=S.|last5=Wilkey|first5=S.|last6=Van Rompay|first6=M.|last7=Kessler|first7=R.C.|displayauthors=1|year=1998|title=Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990–1997: Results of a follow-up national survey|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=188148|journal=JAMA|volume=280|issue=18|pages=1569–75|doi=10.1001/jama.280.18.1569|pmid=9820257|ref={{harvid|Eisenberg et al.|1998}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a 50 percent increase in expenditures and a 25 percent increase in the use of alternative therapies between 1990 and 1997 in America.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg1998" /&gt; Americans spend many billions on the therapies annually.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg1998" /&gt; Most Americans used CAM to treat and/or prevent musculoskeletal conditions or other conditions associated with chronic or recurring pain.&lt;ref name="Barnes2004" /&gt; In America, women were more likely than men to use CAM, with the biggest difference in use of [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Mind-body interventions|mind-body therapies]] including prayer specifically for health reasons".&lt;ref name="Barnes2004" /&gt; In 2008, more than 37% of American hospitals offered alternative therapies, up from 27 percent in 2005, and 25% in 2004.&lt;ref name="Warner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AHA2008" /&gt; More than 70% of the hospitals offering CAM were in urban areas.&lt;ref name="AHA2008" /&gt;

A survey of Americans found that 88 percent thought that "there are some good ways of treating sickness that medical science does not recognize".&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt; Use of magnets was the most common tool in [[energy medicine]] in America, and among users of it, 58 percent described it as at least "sort of [[scientific method|scientific]]", when it is not at all scientific.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt; In 2002, at least 60 percent of US medical schools have at least some class time spent teaching alternative therapies.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt; "[[Therapeutic touch]]" was taught at more than 100 colleges and universities in 75 countries before the practice was debunked by a nine-year-old child for a school science project.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rosa" /&gt;

====Prevalence of use of specific therapies====

The most common CAM therapies used in the US in 2002 were prayer (45%), [[herbalism]] (19%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Breathing Meditation|breathing meditation]] (12%), [[meditation (alternative medicine)|meditation]] (8%), [[chiropractic medicine]] (8%), [[yoga (alternative medicine)|yoga]] (5–6%), [[body work (alternative medicine)|body work]] (5%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Diet-based therapy|diet-based therapy]] (4%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Progressive Relaxation|progressive relaxation]] (3%), [[Orthomolecular medicine|mega-vitamin therapy]] (3%) and [[Visualization (cam)|Visualization]] (2%)&lt;ref name="Barnes2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes2008" /&gt;

In Britain, the most often used alternative therapies were [[Alexander technique]], [[Aromatherapy]], Bach and other flower remedies, Body work therapies including massage, Counseling stress therapies, [[hypnotherapy]], [[Meditation]], [[Reflexology]], [[Shiatsu]], [[Ayurvedic medicine]], Nutritional medicine, and [[Yoga]].{{sfn|Sir Walton: Science and Technology Committee|2000}} Ayurvedic medicine remedies are mainly plant based with some use of animal materials.{{sfn|Wujastyk|2003}} Safety concerns include the use of herbs containing toxic compounds and the lack of quality control in Ayurvedic facilities.&lt;ref name="Valiathan2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saper2008" /&gt;

According to the [[National Health Service (England)]], the most commonly used complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) supported by the NHS in the UK are: acupuncture, aromatherapy, chiropractic, homeopathy, massage, osteopathy and clinical hypnotherapy.&lt;ref name="NHS_Careers_CAM" /&gt;

====In palliative care====

Complementary therapies are often used in [[palliative care]] or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients. Integrative medicine is considered more acceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used in palliative care than in other areas of medicine. "From its early experiences of care for the dying, palliative care took for granted the necessity of placing patient values and lifestyle habits at the core of any design and delivery of quality care at the end of life. If the patient desired complementary therapies, and as long as such treatments provided additional support and did not endanger the patient, they were considered acceptable."&lt;ref name="Kellhear2003" /&gt; The non-pharmacologic interventions of complementary medicine can employ [[mind-body intervention|mind-body]] interventions designed to "reduce pain and concomitant mood disturbance and increase quality of life."&lt;ref name="Menefee2005" /&gt;

=== Regulation ===
{{Further|Regulation of alternative medicine | Regulation and prevalence of homeopathy}}{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}[[File:Use Caution With Ayurvedic Products (FDA October 16, 2008).djvu|thumb|Health campaign flyers, as in this example from the [[Food and Drug Administration]], warn the public about unsafe products.]]

In Austria and Germany complementary and alternative medicine is mainly in the hands of doctors with [[Medical degree|MDs]],&lt;ref name=ernstinterview/&gt; and half or more of the American alternative practitioners are licensed MDs.&lt;ref name="Cassileth1996"/&gt; In Germany herbs are tightly regulated: half are prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance.&lt;ref name="JAMA_book_review"/&gt;

Some professions of complementary/traditional/alternative medicine, such as [[chiropractic]], have achieved full regulation in North America and other parts of the world{{sfn|WHO|2005}} and are regulated in a manner similar to that governing science-based medicine. In contrast, other approaches may be partially recognized and others have no regulation at all. Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine ranges widely from country to country, and state to state.{{sfn|WHO|2005}}

Government bodies in the US and elsewhere have published information or guidance about alternative medicine. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), has issued online warnings for consumers about medication health fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/MedicationHealthFraud/default.htm|title=Medication Health Fraud|work=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a section on Alternative Medicine Fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/MedicationHealthFraud/ucm207747.htm|title=Alternative Medicine Fraud|work=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a warning that Ayurvedic products generally have not been approved by the FDA before marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm050798.htm FDA, ''Use Caution With Ayurvedic Products'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adequacy of regulation and CAM safety====

Many of the claims regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicine are controversial. Some alternative treatments have been associated with unexpected side effects, which can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niggemann|first1=B.|last2=Grüber|first2=C.|title=Side-effects of complementary and alternative medicine|journal=Allergy|date=22 February 2003|volume=58|issue=8|pages=707–16|doi=10.1034/j.1398-9995.2003.00219.x|pmid=12859546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly voiced concerns about complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is the way it's regulated. There have been significant developments in how CAMs should be assessed prior to re-sale in the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU) in the last 2 years. Despite this, it has been suggested that current regulatory bodies have been ineffective in preventing deception of patients as many companies have re-labelled their drugs to avoid the new laws.&lt;ref name="Colquhoun2012"/&gt;  There is no general consensus about how to balance consumer protection (from false claims, toxicity, and advertising) with freedom to choose remedies.

Advocates of CAM suggest that regulation of the industry will adversely affect patients looking for alternative ways to manage their symptoms, even if many of the benefits may represent the placebo affect.&lt;ref name="Connelly2012"/&gt; Some contend that alternative medicines should not require any more regulation than over-the-counter medicines that can also be toxic in overdose (such as paracetamol).&lt;ref name="Malcolm2012"/&gt;

====Interactions with conventional pharmaceuticals====

Forms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Examples include immuno-augmentation therapy, shark cartilage, bioresonance therapy, oxygen and ozone therapies, and insulin potentiation therapy. Some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, or anesthetics during surgery, among other problems.&lt;ref name=CassilethDeng2004/&gt; An example of these dangers was reported by Associate Professor [[Alastair MacLennan (medicine)|Alastair MacLennan]] of Adelaide University, Australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking "natural" potions to "build up her strength" before the operation, including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death.&lt;ref name="Hills1999"/&gt;

To ''ABC Online'', MacLennan also gives another possible mechanism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And lastly there's the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next, and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off, and they're disappointed and they move on to the next one, and they're disappointed and disillusioned, and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult, because you may not get compliance, because they've seen the failure so often in the past.&lt;ref name="SwanABC"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Side-effects====

Conventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]], whereas alternative treatments, in general, are not subjected to such testing at all. Any treatment&amp;nbsp;– whether conventional or alternative&amp;nbsp;– that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side-effects. Attempts to refute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the ''[[appeal to nature]]'' fallacy, i.e., "That which is natural cannot be harmful." Specific groups of patients such as patients with impaired hepatic or renal function are more susceptible to side effects of alternative remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Use of herbal remedies among patients undergoing hemodialysis|journal=Iran J Kidney Dis|pmid=24241097|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258636639_Use_of_herbal_remedies_among_patients_undergoing_hemodialysis|volume=7|issue=6|date=Nov 2013|pages=492–95|author1=Roozbeh|first1=J|last2=Hashempur|first2=M. H.|last3=Heydari|first3=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Herbal products: benefits, limits, and applications in chronic liver disease|journal=Evid Based Complement Alternat Med|pmid=22991573|pmc=3443820|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/837939/|doi=10.1155/2012/837939|volume=2012|year=2012|pages=837939|author1=Del Prete|first1=A|last2=Scalera|first2=A|last3=Iadevaia|first3=M.

An exception to the normal thinking regarding side-effects is [[Homeopathy]]. Since 1938, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has regulated homeopathic products in "several significantly different ways from other drugs."&lt;ref name=Stehlin/&gt; Homeopathic preparations, termed "remedies", are extremely dilute, often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active (and possibly toxic) ingredient is likely to remain. They are, thus, considered safe on that count, but "their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength", and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs.&lt;ref name=Stehlin/&gt;

=====Treatment delay=====

Those having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious, possibly life-threatening illness.&lt;ref name="Navarro2006"/&gt; For this reason, critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous. According to mental health journalist Scott Lilienfeld in 2002, "unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments" and refers to this as "[[opportunity cost]]". Individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either, and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful. In short, even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=Lilienfeld2002/&gt; Between 2001 and 2003, four children died in Australia because their parents chose ineffective naturopathic, homeopathic, or other alternative medicines and diets rather than conventional therapies.&lt;ref name=Hughes2010/&gt;

====Unconventional cancer "cures"====

There have always been "many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in [[biomedicine]]. These alternative cancer cures have often been described as 'unproven,' suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown." However, "many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective....The label 'unproven' is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been 'disproven'."&lt;ref name=Vickers/&gt;

[[Edzard Ernst]] has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...any alternative cancer cure is bogus by definition. There will never be an alternative cancer cure. Why? Because if something looked halfway promising, then mainstream oncology would scrutinize it, and if there is anything to it, it would become mainstream almost automatically and very quickly. All curative "alternative cancer cures" are based on false claims, are bogus, and, I would say, even criminal.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{Citation |last=Miller |first=Gabriel |date=2 September 2014 |title=Asking the Experts: Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Cancer |work=[[Medscape]] |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/830553_print |accessdate=7 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Rejection of science===
{{Reduced pull quote|1=right

"CAM", meaning "complementary and alternative medicine", is not as well researched as conventional medicine, which undergoes intense research before release to the public.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; Funding for research is also sparse making it difficult to do further research for effectiveness of CAM.&lt;ref name="Ernst4" /&gt; Most funding for CAM is funded by government agencies.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; Proposed research for CAM are rejected by most private funding agencies because the results of research are not reliable.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt;  The research for CAM has to meet certain standards from research ethics committees, which most CAM researchers find almost impossible to meet.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; Even with the little research done on it, CAM has not been proven to be effective.&lt;ref name="Ernst3" /&gt;

[[Steven Novella]], a neurologist at Yale School of Medicine, wrote that government funded studies of integrating alternative medicine techniques into the mainstream are "used to lend an appearance of legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate."&lt;ref name="Brown2009" /&gt; Marcia Angell considered that critics felt that healthcare practices should be classified based solely on [[evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]], and if a treatment had been rigorously tested and found safe and effective, science-based medicine will adopt it regardless of whether it was considered "alternative" to begin with.&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt; It is possible for a method to change categories (proven vs. unproven), based on increased knowledge of its effectiveness or lack thereof. A prominent supporter of this position is [[George D. Lundberg]], former editor of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA).&lt;ref name="Fontanarosa1998" /&gt;

Writing in 1999 in ''CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians'' [[Barrie R. Cassileth]] mentioned a 1997 letter to the [[US Senate]] Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which had deplored the lack of critical thinking and scientific rigor in OAM-supported research, had been signed by four Nobel Laureates and other prominent scientists. (This was supported by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).)&lt;ref name="Cassileth1999" /&gt;

In March 2009 a staff writer for ''[[the Washington Post]]'' reported that the impending national discussion about broadening access to health care, improving medical practice and saving money was giving a group of scientists an opening to propose shutting down the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. They quoted one of these scientists, [[Steven Salzberg]], a genome researcher and computational biologist at the University of Maryland, as saying "One of our concerns is that NIH is funding pseudoscience."  They noted that the vast majority of studies were based on fundamental misunderstandings of [[physiology]] and [[disease]], and had shown little or no effect.&lt;ref name="Brown2009" /&gt;

Writers such as [[Carl Sagan]], a noted astrophysicist, advocate of [[scientific skepticism]] and the author of ''[[The Demon-Haunted World|The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark]]'' (1996), have lambasted the lack of empirical evidence to support the existence of the putative energy fields on which these therapies are predicated.{{sfn|Sagan|1996}}

Sampson has also pointed out that CAM tolerated [[fallacy|contradiction]] without thorough reason and experiment.&lt;ref name="SampsonAtwood2005" /&gt; Barrett has pointed out that there is a policy at the NIH of never saying something doesn't work only that a different version or dose might give different results.&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion" /&gt; Barrett also expressed concern that, just because some "alternatives" have merit, there is the impression that the rest deserve equal consideration and respect even though most are worthless, since they are all classified under the one heading of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name="Quackwatch_wary" /&gt;

Some critics of alternative medicine are focused upon health fraud, misinformation, and quackery as public health problems, notably [[Wallace Sampson]] and [[Paul Kurtz]] founders of [[Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine]] and [[Stephen Barrett]], co-founder of [[The National Council Against Health Fraud]] and webmaster of [[Quackwatch]].&lt;ref name="NCAHF_mission" /&gt; Grounds for opposing alternative medicine include that:
* It is usually based on [[religion]], tradition, [[superstition]], belief in [[supernatural]] energies, [[pseudoscience]], [[fallacy|errors in reasoning]], propaganda, or fraud.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Other_sources" /&gt;
* Alternative therapies typically lack any [[scientific validation]], and their effectiveness is either [[Scientific method|unproved]] or [[Scientific evidence|disproved]].&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldrosen2004" /&gt;{{dubious|date=January 2013}}
* Treatments are not part of the conventional, science-based healthcare system.&lt;ref name="WHO_Trad_Med_Defs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt;{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=17 17–19]}}&lt;ref name="Zollman1999" /&gt;
* Research on alternative medicine is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed.&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt;{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=146 146]}}
* Where alternative treatments have replaced conventional science-based medicine, even with the safest alternative medicines, failure to use or delay in using conventional science-based medicine has caused deaths.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes2010" /&gt;
* Methods may incorporate or base themselves on [[traditional medicine]], [[Home remedy|folk knowledge]], spiritual beliefs, ignorance or misunderstanding of scientific principles, errors in reasoning, or newly conceived approaches claiming to heal.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acharya2008" /&gt;

Many alternative medical treatments are not [[patent]]able,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} which may lead to less research funding from the private sector. In addition, in most countries, alternative treatments (in contrast to pharmaceuticals) can be marketed without any proof of efficacy&amp;nbsp;– also a disincentive for manufacturers to fund scientific research.&lt;ref name="Ernst2005" /&gt;

English evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], in his 2003 book ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'', defined alternative medicine as a "set of practices that cannot be tested, refuse to be tested, or consistently fail tests."&lt;ref name="Dawkins2003" /&gt; Dawkins argued that if a technique is demonstrated effective in properly performed trials then it ceases to be alternative and simply becomes medicine.&lt;ref name="Holloway2003" /&gt;

CAM is also often less regulated than conventional medicine.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; There are ethical concerns about whether people who perform CAM have the proper knowledge to treat patients.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; CAM is often done by non-physicians who do not operate with the same medical licensing laws which govern conventional medicine,&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; and it is often described as an issue of [[non-maleficence]].&lt;ref name="Ernst2" /&gt;

According to two writers, Wallace Sampson and K. Butler, marketing is part of the training required in alternative medicine, and propaganda methods in alternative medicine have been traced back to those used by [[Hitler]] and [[Goebels]] in their promotion of pseudoscience in medicine.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ButlerBarrett1992" /&gt;

In November 2011 [[Edzard Ernst]] stated that the "level of misinformation about alternative medicine has now reached the point where it has become dangerous and unethical. So far, alternative medicine has remained an ethics-free zone. It is time to change this."&lt;ref name="Ernst_Guardian" /&gt;

=== Conflicts of interest ===

Some commentators have said that special consideration must be given to the issue of [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] in alternative medicine. [[Edzard Ernst]] has said  that most researchers into alternative medicine are at risk of "unidirectional bias" because of a generally uncritical belief in their chosen subject.&lt;ref name="unid"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ernst E|authorlink=Edzard Ernst|year=2011|title=Conflicts of Interest in Alternative Medicine|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/conflicts_of_interest_in_alternative_medicine|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=35|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst cites as evidence the phenomenon whereby 100% of a sample of acupuncture trials originating in China had positive conclusions.&lt;ref name="unid" /&gt; [[David Gorski]] contrasts [[evidence-based medicine]], in which researchers try to disprove hyphotheses, with what he says is the frequent practice in pseudoscience-based research, of striving to confirm pre-existing notions.&lt;ref name="gorski"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/conflicts-of-interest-in-science-based-medicine/|title=Conflicts of interest in science-based medicine|author=Gorski D|authorlink=David Gorski|date=16 November 2009|publisher=[[Science-Based Medicine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harriet Hall]] writes that there is a contrast between the circumstances of alternative medicine practitioners and disinterested scientists: in the case of acupuncture, for example, an acupuncturist would have "a great deal to lose" if acupuncture were rejected by research; but the disinterested skeptic would not lose anything if its effects were confirmed; rather their change of mind would enhance their skeptical credentials.&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/conflicts-of-interest/|title=Conflicts of interest|author=Hall HA|authorlink=Harriet A.

In [[chemistry]], '''antagonism''' is a phenomenon wherein two or more agents in combination have an overall effect that is less than the sum of their individual effects.

The word is most commonly used in this context in [[biochemistry]] and [[toxicology]]: interference in the physiological action of a chemical substance by another having a similar structure. For instance, a [[receptor antagonist]] is an agent that reduces the response that a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] produces when the receptor antagonist binds to a [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] on a [[cell (biology)|cell]]. An example of this is the [[interleukin-1]] receptor antagonist. The opposite of antagonism is [[synergy]]. It is a negative type of synergism.

Experiments with different combinations show that binary mixtures of [[natural phenol|phenol]]ics can lead to either a [[synergy|synergetic]] [[antioxidant effect of natural phenols|antioxidant effect]] or to an antagonistic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11746-003-0812-z|title=Antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds in 2,2′-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidation: Synergistic and antagonistic effects|journal=Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society|volume=80|issue=10|pages=1007|year=2003|last1=Peyrat-Maillard|first1=M.

The '''Arts and Humanities Research Council''' ('''AHRC''') was established in April 2005 as successor to the Arts and Humanities Research Board and is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[UK Research Councils|Research Council]]; [[non-departmental public body]] that provides approximately £102 million from the [[UK government|government]]  to support [[research]] and postgraduate study in the [[arts]] and [[humanities]], from languages and law, archaeology and English literature to design and creative and performing arts. In any one year, the AHRC makes approximately 700 research awards and around 1,350 postgraduate awards. Awards are made after a rigorous peer review process, to ensure that only applications of the highest quality are funded.

==Recently funded research==

===Stonehenge Riverside Project===

The [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]] is a major five year AHRC-funded archaeological research study interested in the development of the [[Stonehenge]] landscape in Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain. In particular, the project is interested in the relationship between the stones and surrounding monuments and features including; The River Avon, Durrington Walls, the Cursus, the Avenue, Woodhenge, burial mounds, and nearby standing stones. In August 2009 the project discovered a new stone circle, which was named [[Bluestonehenge]] by the research team, about one mile away from [[Stonehenge]] in [[Wiltshire]], England. The project is run by a consortium of university teams.  It is directed by Prof. Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University, with co-directors Dr Josh Pollard (University of Southampton), Prof. Julian Thomas (Manchester University), Dr Kate Welham (Bournemouth University) and Dr Colin Richards (Manchester University).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shef.ac.uk/mediacentre/2009/1363.html |title=News releases 2009 |work=shef.ac.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Soldier Database===

Researchers at the University of Reading and University of Southampton analysed historic sources such as muster rolls records in the National Archives at Kew and the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris (for records of English garrisons in France). The resulting Medieval Soldier online database enables people to search for soldiers by surname, rank or year of service.  The online database contains 250,000 service records of soldiers who saw active duty in the latter phases of the Hundred Years' War (1369–1453).

===Old Bailey Proceedings Archive===

An AHRC research grant enabled academics from the [[University of Hertfordshire]], [[University of Sheffield]] and the [[Open University]] to double in size the [[Old Bailey]] trial proceedings available to view on the Old Bailey Proceedings Online website and provide access to the largest single source of searchable information about ordinary British lives and behaviour ever published.

The Old Bailey Proceedings Online makes available a fully searchable, digitised collection of all surviving editions of the Old Bailey Proceedings from 1674 to 1913, and of the [[Ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]] of [[Newgate Prison|Newgate]]'s Accounts, 1679 to 1772. It allows access to over 197,000 trials and biographical details of approximately 2,500 men and women executed at [[Tyburn]].

==History==

In 2005 the AHRC replaced the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB), founded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Creating the AHRC: An Arts and Humanities Research Council for the United Kingdom in the Twenty-first Century (Oxford UP, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The AHRC publish reviews and reports on arts and humanities subjects, as well as corporate publications. Research news and findings are communicated in website features, press releases, and multimedia content such as podcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/Publications/Pages/Publications.aspx |title=Publications - Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council |publisher=Ahrc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2010, the AHRC published a magazine called ''Podium'' twice a year, which contained news and case studies based on research that they have funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/Publications/Publications-archive/Pages/Publications-archive.aspx/ |title=Publications archive - Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council |publisher=Ahrc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The AHRC is one of seven [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]] in the UK.

Professor Andrew S Thompson is serving as Interim Chief Executive of the AHRC, from December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/appointment-of-interim-chief-executive-for-the-arts-and-humanities-research-council&lt;/ref&gt; The previous CE of the AHRC was Professor Rick Rylance who took up the post on 1 September 2009, and was re-appointed in September 2013 to serve until August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/News/Pages/Reappointment-of-Chief-Executive-for-the-AHRC.aspx |title=Reappointment of Chief Executive for the AHRC - Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council |publisher=Ahrc.ac.uk |date=2013-09-01 |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Council Chair is Sir Drummond Bone. Sir [[Alan Wilson (academic)|Alan Wilson]] stepped down in December 2013.

It was founded in 1978 in [[Washington, D.C.]] and is a member of the [[Institute for Certification of Computing Professionals]] (ICCP).&lt;ref name=awc&gt;{{cite web|title=Association for Women in Computing -  Home|url= http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html|publisher=acw-hq.org|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose of AWC is to provide opportunities for professional growth for women in computing through networking, continuing education and mentoring.&lt;ref name="awc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sv7N_JKMPl8C&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=%22Association%20for%20Women%20in%20Computing%22&amp;pg=PA188#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Association%20for%20Women%20in%20Computing%22&amp;f=false|title=Recent Advances and Issues in Computers|last=Gay|first=Martin K.|publisher=Oryx Press|year=2000|isbn=1573562270|location=|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accomplish this they promote awareness of issues affecting women in the computing industry, further the professional development and advancement of women in computing, and encourage women to pursue careers in [[computer science]]. The AWC is a national, nonprofit, professional organization for women and men with an interest in information technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.awcps.org/|title=Association for Women in Computing - Puget Sound - Home|website=www.awcps.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
AWC was founded in 1978 as a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]], originally under the name National Association for Women in Computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mardesich|first=Jodi|date=17 October 1994|title=Networking Groups Strive to Put Women Back in the Loop|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=%22Association%20for%20Women%20in%20Computing%22&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Association%20for%20Women%20in%20Computing%22&amp;f=false|journal=InfoWorld|doi=|pmid=|access-date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Puget Sound Chapter was founded in the winter of 1979 by Donnafaye Carroll Finger and Diane Haelsig. These two women read an article about a new association for women in computing and were soon discussing the formation of a Puget Sound Chapter. The Twin Cities Chapter of the AWC first met in December, 1979 and became a chartered chapter on May 6, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.awctc.org/sample-page/|title=About AWC – AWC Twin Cities|website=www.awctc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22022">Space is a high-tech arena where rival ideologies clashed, showcasing their technological prowess under the watchful eyes of the entire globe. The competition between the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and the United States brought about a rapid succession of firsts – the first human in orbit, the first steps on the Moon, the first space station and the first reusable launch system. However, once the dust settled, and the eye-popping bill of the early space activities hit government coffers, a new rationale emerged: pragmatic use of space as the higher ground for improving life on Earth.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.lib.ou.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-6696-3.pdf|title=Fundamentals of Space Business and Economics|last=Gurtuna|first=Ozgur|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4614-6695-6|location=Springer New York Heidelberg Dordrecht London|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From satellite telecommunications to remote sensing, micro gravity research and satellite navigation government, space programs began investing in practical outcomes for the public good. Therefore, the importance of measuring the socio-economic benefits of space activities steadily grew throughout the 1970s and 1980s, an era defined as “Mission to Planet Earth.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These benefits continue into today's society as the privatization of space travel and space exploration continues to show scientific and socio-economic benefits to those around them. 

== Direct benefits ==
Space programs have generated a wide range of hardware, software and processes that have made their way into a myriad of applications. The benefits of these applications are directly attributable to the original investments made by the space agencies and the private sector.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Space exploration alone has provided a significant amount of knowledge that is important for the education of people about a basic understanding of our planet and the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=U.S. National Debate Topic 2011-2012 American Space Exploration and Development|last=Mari|first=Christopher|publisher=The H.W. Wilson Company|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York and Dublin|pages=76-77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more direct benefits of space exploration include an increase in the knowledge that is out there about space and the discovery of distant planets and galaxies, it also gives us insight into the beginnings of our universe.

=== Knowledge of space ===
Since [[Sputnik 1]] entered orbit in 1957 to perform [[Ionosphere|Ionospheric]] experiments, the human understanding of earth and space have increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuznetsov, Sinelnikov, and Alpert|first=|date=June 2015|title=Yakov Alpert: Sputnik-1 and the first satellite ionospheric experiment|url=|journal=Advances in Space Research|volume=55|pages=2833-839|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of missions to the Moon|list of missions to the moon]] begin as early as 1958 and continued into the current age. A few successful lunar missions, by the USSR, include missions such as, the [[Luna 1]] space craft that completed the first flyby of the moon in 1959, the [[Luna 3]] lunar probe that took the first pictures of the far side of the moon in 1959, the [[Luna 10]] orbiter that was the first orbiter of the moon in 1966, and the [[Lunokhod 1]] lunar rover in 1970, which was the first rover that explored the surface of a world beyond earth. The USA also added significant lunar first, such as [[Apollo 8]] in 1968 being the first successful human mission to orbit the moon and the historic [[Apollo 11]] in 1969 when man first landed on the moon.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://moon.nasa.gov/exploration/moon-missions/|title=Moon: NASA Science: Missions|work=Moon: NASA Science|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Missions to the moon have collected samples of Lunar materials and there are now multiple satellites such as [[ARTEMIS P1]] that currently orbit the moon and collect data.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

Telescopic satellites have captured millions of images of the universe since the introduction of satellites, such as the Mariner Space Satellites. The[[Mariner 4| Mariner 4]] space satellite in 1965 was the first successful satellite to capture up close images of the planet [[Mars]]. Mariner missions 6 and 7 additionally mapped the poles of the Red planet and relayed further images of the surface. By the end of the Mariner missions in 1972,[[Mariner 9| Mariner 9]] spent almost a year in the Martian orbit (687 days), collected images of nearly 100% of the surface of the moon, and observed notable discoveries including the humongous[[Olympus Mons| Olympus Mons]] volcano, more than 4000 km of [[Valles Marineris| Valles Marineris]], and dust storms lasting over a month.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/missions/index-past.html|title=Mars Exploration Past Missions|last=Greicius|first=Tony|date=2015-03-13|work=NASA|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further missions since 1972, like the [[Viking program|Viking project]], [[Mars Observer|Mars observer]], [[Mars Pathfinder|Mars pathfinder]], [[Mars Climate Orbiter|Mars climate orbiter]], [[Deep Space 2]], [[Mars Global Surveyor|Mars Global surveyor]], and[[Phoenix (spacecraft)| Phoenix]], have obtained understandings of the climate, flood plains, and rock samples on mars.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Hubble deep field.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Hubble Deep Field]]
[[Hubble space telescope|The Hubble space telescope]] has contributed more than a million observations of the universe that have been influential in understanding the magnitude of the universe since its introduction into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-s-discoveries|title=Hubble Discoveries|last=NASA|first=|date=October 19, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intense focus of[[Hubble space telescope| Hubble]] [is] for observation. The Hubble telescope has been used to discover galaxies and planets across the universe. It was pointed at a speck of black space in space for ten consecutive days and the resultant image that is known as the [[Hubble Deep Field]] revealed at least 1,500 galaxies in this small location in the sky. Views like this allow the realization of the size and scope of the larger universal understanding of the types and variances of galaxies out in space. The [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble space telescope]] has cost about $12 billion in the last 30 years including the cost of 5 shuttle servicing missions, the information received by the astronomers monitoring the Hubble telescope provides a better understanding that would not be possible on from earth telescopes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Direct Indirect Benefits ==

=== Culture and inspiration ===
[[Human Culture|Human culture]] exists as a social environment made up by traditions, norms, rules written or unwritten, and social practices. Cultures can be specific to groups of any size such as a family or group of friends but also as large as a state or nation. The range and diversity of human culture is markedly large. International collaboration in the space age brought together different cultures and as a result, the exchange and advancement of human culture. In over fifty years of space travel, the diversity of those working in space and in the field as a whole has dramatically increased from the beginnings of space exploration. This progression in diversity brought more cultures into close quarters and resulted in the enrichment of human culture globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Philip R.|date=1986-01-01|title=The influence of culture on space developments|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/bs.3830310103|journal=Behavioral Science|volume=31|issue=1|pages=12–28|doi=10.1002/bs.3830310103|issn=1099-1743}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A testament to space exploration facilitating cross-cultural growth, the [[International Space Station]] exhibits an important collaboration between nations to construct and continually man the station. The ISS operates as a research facility that contributes cutting edge scientific work from a unique environment that is nearly impossible to recreate on earth.  

The innovation and exploration of the space age has served as an inspiration to humankind. Breaking through into space travel, man leaving earth and defeating gravity, taking steps on the moon, and various other achievements were pivotal moments in human cultural development. In particular, the scientific and technological advancements stand as an inspiration to the scientific community of students, teachers, and researchers worldwide. Moreover, space exploration has also inspired innovative training programs aimed at preschoolers, such as the [https://www.funlearning.com/astronaut-program Future Astronauts Program]. It is evident that by drawing in the wonder of space together with the knowledge and skills developed through space exploration into classrooms, children can be strongly motivated and empowered from a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://funacademy.fi/train-children-like-future-astronaut/|title=Every Child Should Train Like A Future Astronaut. This Is Why.|last=Sanders|first=Claire|date=10 July 2018|website=Fun Academy|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Space exploration has nearly no limit to how far humankind can adventure as our technology advances. Space exploration will continue to foster international inspiration and collaboration, and pose revolutionary philosophical, political, and scientific questions and debates.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.globalspaceexploration.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Benefits-Stemming-from-Space-Exploration-2013.pdf|title=Benefits Stemming from Space Exploration|last=|first=|publisher=ISECG|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global partnerships ===
The [[International Space Station]] (ISS), is a space station assembled in low Earth orbit largely by the United States and Russia, with assistance and components from a multinational consortium. In 1993, the United States and Russia agreed to merge their separate space station plans into a single facility integrating their respective modules and incorporating contributions from the [[European Space Agency| European Space Agency]] and Japan. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic-eb-com.ezproxy.lib.ou.edu/levels/collegiate/article/International-Space-Station/387674|title=International Space Station (ISS)|last=Harland|first=David|date=16 January 2018|access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborations among the larger international community have provided the ability to test things in space and see how objects and people react to space for extended periods of time. Work on the sustainability of long term space flights and the possibilities of [[Interplanetary spaceflight|Interplanetary spaceflights]] have been major objectives of the [[International Space Station|ISS]].

These partnerships benefit all nations, even those outside the industrialized world. Some African countries, including Nigeria and South Africa, have successfully employed space technology—specifically satellite-based disaster management, climate monitoring, and green systems—to tackle workforce development issues and launch new space activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-11-01|title=Global partnerships: Expanding the frontiers of space exploration education|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576512002251|journal=Acta Astronautica|language=en|volume=80|pages=190–196|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.05.034|issn=0094-5765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spinoffs ===
[[File:NASA Spinoff 2007 cover.jpg|thumb]]
[[NASA]]  reports that 444,000 lives have been saved, 14,000 jobs have been created, 5 billion dollars in revenue has been generated, and there has been 6.2 billion dollars in cost reduction due to Spin-off programs from NASA research in collaboration with various companies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;NASA. ''Spinoff''. 2012, spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2012/pdf/Spinoff2012.pdf. &lt;/ref&gt; Of the many beneficial [[NASA spinoff technologies]] there has been advancements in the fields of health and medicine, transportation, public safety, consumer goods, energy and environment, information technology, and industrial productivity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Multiple products and innovations used in the daily life are results of space generated research.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Solar panels, water-purification systems, dietary formulas and supplements, space suit materials in clothing, and global search and rescue systems are but a few examples of the beneficiary spinoffs that have been produced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/Benefits-Stemming-from-Space-Exploration-2013-TAGGED.pdf|title=Benefits Stemming from Space Exploration|last=ISECG|first=|date=September 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Space Station ===
[[File:ISS March 2009.jpg|thumb]]
The unifying efforts to create the International Space Station took form in December of 1998 as the space shuttle [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavor]] launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Outposts on the Frontier: A Fifty-Year History of Space Stations|last=LINCOLN; LONDON|first=|publisher=UNP - Nebraska|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=343-344}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Collectively, 18 nations took some part in the development and construction of space station and the five notable agencies that encompassed these 18 nations were NASA, [[Roscosmos]], the [[European Space Agency]], the [[Canadian Space Agency|Canadian Space agency]] and the [[National Space Development Agency of Japan]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The international space station serves as a depot of collaboration across the world for innovative research, human health research, global education and earth observation. The international space station itself contains complex sensors including Light Detection and Ranging systems are influential in the understanding of sea surface winds and of atmospheric transportation patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/benefits/index.html|title=ISS Benefits for Humanity|last=Rainey|first=Kristine|date=2015-03-10|work=NASA|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional astronaut observation from the station with powerful cameras provides detailed images of the earth and panoramic views of the atmosphere of the earth.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/benefits/earth_obs_disaster_response_ed2|title=Earth Observation and Disaster Response|last=Rainey|first=Kristine|date=2015-12-02|work=NASA|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data collected from the space station complex orbital sensor system have been a valuable tool in evaluating the extent of damage resulting from natural disaster. Real time mapping coupled with a human crew allows for space to ground collaboration.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Communications ===
The first communication "satellite" was actually a balloon called [[Echo 1]] it was launched on August 12, 1960 and stayed roughly 1000 miles (1,609 km) above the Earth and didn't come back down until May 24, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/8973-1st-communication-satellite-giant-space-balloon-50-years.html|title=1st Communication Satellite: A Giant Space Balloon 50 Years Ago|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first communication satellite that would be an actual satellite by modern standards was launched on July 10, 1962 and it was named [[Telstar]]. It allowed communication between the United States and Europe to occur almost instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/fifty-years-ago-today-the-first-communications-satellite-was-launched-into-space-1454520/|title=Fifty Years Ago Today, the First Communications Satellite Was Launched Into Space|last=Stromberg|first=Joseph|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telstar operated for approximately a year before it shutdown, but even with its rather short lifespan, it proved that the usage of satellites as a form of long distance communication was possible and better than forms of communication before it. Now, communications satellites have many different functions and are far more sophisticated than the original ones. They can be used to communicate long distances in remote areas with the use of satellite phones. Airlines use them to provide internet service on their flights. They are also starting to be used to deliver internet to areas that are unable to get internet in any other way due to their location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Connecting Remote Areas To the Internet-By Satellite|last=Whitwam|first=Ryan|date=March 1, 2016|work=PC Magazine|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of communication satellites has since expanded to about 2,000 in orbit that are able to provide continuous communication around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/satellite-communication|title=Satellite communication|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Weather satellites ===
The first weather satellite named [[TIROS-1|TIROS I]] (Television and InfraRed Observation Satellite) was launched on April 1, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noaasis.noaa.gov/NOAASIS/ml/40yearsa.html|title=NOAASIS - NOAA Satellite Information System for NOAA Meteorological / Weather Satellites|website=noaasis.noaa.gov|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite used television cameras to take pictures of clouds as it orbited the Earth. TIROS I only operated for 78 days, however during that time it was able to prove that using a satellite to observe weather conditions on Earth was not only possible, but that it could greatly increase the amount of data available to meteorologists with the result was that more accurate weather forecasts were possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1627.html|title=TIROS, the Nation's First Weather Satellite|last=Administrator|first=NASA Content|date=2015-04-20|work=NASA|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of satellites has since come a long way. The number of weather satellites has increased significantly, and the satellites themselves are now more sophisticated. In addition to taking pictures of clouds they can now observe weather patterns in the same area 24/7 because they are in geostationary orbit, meaning that they move at the same speed as the Earth's rotation and thus they always see the same area. Even when it is dark in the part of the world that they are observing they can see through the use of infrared technology.  This allows meteorologists to monitor the development of weather in areas that are not covered by traditional means like Doppler radar, such as over the ocean, which, in turn, allows them to give advanced warnings for severe weather such as hurricanes thus saving lives. Weather satellites can also be used to observe the amount of ice at the poles, and where that ice may go if it breaks off. Also, the satellites are used to take pictures of the snow coverage in an area which can help determine the amount of water that will run off when the snow eventually melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noaasis.noaa.gov/NOAASIS/ml/genlsatl.html|title=NOAA Satellite Information System (NOAASIS)|website=noaasis.noaa.gov|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are even being used to predict the amount of power that solar panels can make in certain areas by monitoring the cloud cover and weather patterns at the proposed solar panel site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierro|first1=Marco|last2=De Felice|first2=Matteo|last3=Maggioni|first3=Enrico|last4=Moser|first4=David|last5=Perotto|first5=Alessandro|last6=Spada|first6=Francesco|last7=Cornaro|first7=Cristina|title=Data-driven upscaling methods for regional photovoltaic power estimation and forecast using satellite and numerical weather prediction data|journal=[[Solar Energy (journal)|Solar Energy]]|date=December 2017|volume=158|pages=1026–1038|doi=10.1016/j.solener.2017.09.068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biomedical research ===
[[File:Space body fluid.svg|thumb]]
Beginning in 1967, NASA successfully began its [[Biosatellite program]] that initially took frog eggs, amoeba, bacteria, planets and mice and studied the effects of zero gravity on these biological life forms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/50th/50th_magazine/historyLetter.html|title=NASA - 50 Years of NASA History|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of human life in space have augmented the understanding of the effects of adjusting to a space environment, such as alterations in body fluids, negative influences on the immune system and effects of space on sleep patterns.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Space Biology: Research on Cells, Animals, and Plants in Space|last=Clément|first=Gilles|publisher=NY: Springer New York|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current space research pursuits are divided into the subjects of Space Biology, which studies the effects of space on smaller organisms such as cells, Space Physiology, which is the study of the effects of space on the human body and Space Medicine, which examines the possible dangers of space on the human body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Discoveries concerning the human body and space, particularly the effects on the development of bones, may provide further understanding of biomineralization and the process of gene transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clément|first=Gilles|date=2005|title=Fundamentals of Space Medicine|url=|journal=The Space Technology Library|volume=17|pages=3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium''''' is a 1997 book by the American [[astronomer]] and science popularizer [[Carl Sagan]]. The last book written by Sagan before his death in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sagan, Carl |title=Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=1997 |isbn=0-679-41160-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was published by [[Random House]].

==Overview==
The book is a collection of essays Sagan wrote covering diverse topics such as [[global warming]], the [[population explosion]], [[extraterrestrial life]], [[morality]], and the [[abortion debate]]. The last chapter is an account of his struggle with [[myelodysplasia]], the disease which finally took his life in December 1996. Sagan's wife, [[Ann Druyan]], wrote the epilogue of the book after his death.

=="Billions and billions"==
To help viewers of ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'' distinguish between "millions" and "billions", Sagan stressed the "b". Sagan never did, however, say "[[q:Carl Sagan|billions and billions]]". The public's association of the phrase and Sagan came from a ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]]'' skit. Parodying Sagan's affect, [[Johnny Carson]] quipped "billions and billions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/carl_sagan_takes_questions Carl Sagan takes questions more from his 'Wonder and Skepticism' CSICOP 1994 keynote, Skeptical Inquirer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221054208/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/carl_sagan_takes_questions |date=December 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has, however, now become a humorous fictitious number—the [[Sagan (number)|Sagan]].

'''Biophotons''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] βίος meaning "life" and φῶς meaning "light") are [[photons]] of light in the [[ultraviolet]] and low visible light range that are produced by a [[biological system]].  They are non-thermal in origin, and the emission of biophotons is technically a type of [[bioluminescence]], though  bioluminescence is  generally reserved for higher [[luminance]] [[luciferin]]/[[luciferase]] systems. The term ''biophoton'' used in this narrow sense should not be confused with the broader field of [[biophotonics]], which studies the general interaction of light with biological systems.

Biological tissues typically produce an observed [[irradiance|radiant emittance]] in the visible and ultraviolet frequencies ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;−17&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (approx 1-1000 photons/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/second).&lt;ref name="Popp-2003"/&gt;
This low level of light has a much weaker intensity than the visible light produced by bioluminescence, but biophotons are detectable above the background of [[thermal radiation]] that is emitted by tissues at their normal temperature.

While detection of biophotons has been reported by several groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03325.x |title=Biophoton detection as a novel technique for cancer imaging |year=2004 |last1=Takeda |first1=Motohiro |last2=Kobayashi |first2=Masaki |last3=Takayama |first3=Mariko |last4=Suzuki |first4=Satoshi |last5=Ishida |first5=Takanori |last6=Ohnuki |first6=Kohji |last7=Moriya |first7=Takuya |last8=Ohuchi |first8=Noriaki |journal=Cancer Science |volume=95 |issue=8 |pages=656–61 |pmid=15298728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0846.2010.00442.x |title=Ultra-weak photon emission as a non-invasive tool for monitoring of oxidative processes in the epidermal cells of human skin: Comparative study on the dorsal and the palm side of the hand |year=2010 |last1=Rastogi |first1=Anshu |last2=Pospíšil |first2=Pavel |journal=Skin Research and Technology |pmid=20637006 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=365–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/1011-1344(93)80076-L |title=Artificial sunlight irradiation induces ultraweak photon emission in human skin fibroblasts |year=1993 |last1=Niggli |first1=Hugo J. |journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology |volume=18 |issue=2–3 |pages=281–5 |pmid=8350193}}&lt;/ref&gt; hypotheses that such biophotons indicate the state of biological tissues and facilitate a form of cellular communication are still under investigation,&lt;ref name="Bajpai 2009"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bajpai| first=R | title=Biophotons: a clue to unravel the mystery of "life"  -  Book= Bioluminescence in Focus  -  a collection of illuminating essays;  ed Meyer-Rochow VB; Res Signpost Trivandrum|date=2009|volume= 1: | pages=357–385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=arXiv|first1=Emerging Technology from the|title=Are there optical communication channels in our brains?|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608797/are-there-optical-communication-channels-in-our-brains/|accessdate=9 September 2017|work=MIT Technology Review|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that biophotons are responsible for physical healing are unsupported. {{citation needed|date=June 2018}} [[Alexander Gurwitsch]], who discovered the existence of biophotons, was awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] in 1941 for his mitogenic radiation work.&lt;ref name="Beloussov_1997__"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9449452 |url=http://www.intjdevbiol.com/paper.php?doi=9449452 |year=1997 |last1=Beloussov |first1=LV |last2=Opitz |first2=JM |last3=Gilbert |first3=SF |title=Life of Alexander G.

==Detection and measurement==
Biophotons may be detected with [[photomultiplier]]s or by means of an ultra low noise [[CCD camera]] to produce an image, using an exposure time of typically 15 minutes for plant materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=MPMI|volume=18|issue=2|year=2005|pages=95–102|doi=10.1094/MPMI-18-0095|pmid=15720077|title=Biophoton Imaging: A Nondestructive Method for Assaying R Gene Responses |url=http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/MPMI-18-0095|last1=Bennett|first1=Mark|last2=Mehta|first2=Monaz|last3=Grant|first3=Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biophoton detection as a novel technique for cancer|journal=Cancer Science |volume=95|issue=8 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03325.x/pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03325.x|pmid=15298728|date=August 2004|pages=656–61 | last1 = Takeda | first1 = M | last2 = Kobayashi | first2 = M | last3 = Takayama | first3 = M | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed physical mechanisms ==

Chemi-excitation via [[oxidative stress]] by [[reactive oxygen species]] and/or [[catalysis]] by [[enzymes]] (i.e., [[peroxidase]], [[lipoxygenase]]) is a common event in the biomolecular [[wikt:milieu|milieu]].&lt;ref name=pmid7635351&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0891-5849(95)00002-F |pmid=7635351 |title=From free radicals to electronically excited species |journal=Free Radical Biology and Medicine |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=103–14 |year=1995 |last1=Cilento |first1=Giuseppe |last2=Adam |first2=Waldemar }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such reactions can lead to the formation of [[Spin triplet|triplet]] excited species, which release [[photons]] upon returning to a lower [[energy level]] in a process analogous to [[phosphorescence]]. That this process is a contributing factor to spontaneous biophoton emission has been indicated by studies demonstrating that biophoton emission can be increased by depleting assayed tissue of [[antioxidants]]&lt;ref name=pmid2801215&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bio.1170040134 |pmid=2801215 |title=Oxidative stress in the rat heart, studies on low-level chemiluminescence |journal=Journal of Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=241–4 |year=1989 |last1=Ursini |first1=Fulvio |last2=Barsacchi |first2=Renata |last3=Pelosi |first3=Gualtiero |last4=Benassi |first4=Antonio }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by addition of carbonyl derivatizing agents.&lt;ref name=pmid11467852&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/bbrc.2001.5285 |pmid=11467852 |title=Activity-Dependent Neural Tissue Oxidation Emits Intrinsic Ultraweak Photons |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=285 |issue=4 |pages=1007 |year=2001 |last1=Kataoka |first1=Yosky |last2=Cui |first2=Yilong |last3=Yamagata |first3=Aya |last4=Niigaki |first4=Minoru |last5=Hirohata |first5=Toru |last6=Oishi |first6=Noboru |last7=Watanabe |first7=Yasuyoshi }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further support is provided by studies indicating that emission can be increased by addition of [[reactive oxygen species]].&lt;ref name=pmid6928628&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.77.1.347 |title=Organ chemiluminescence: Noninvasive assay for oxidative radical reactions |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=77 |pages=347 |year=1980 |last1=Boveris |first1=A |last2=Cadenas |first2=E |last3=Reiter |first3=R |last4=Filipkowski |first4=M |last5=Nakase |first5=Y |last6=Chance |first6=B |bibcode=1980PNAS...77..347B |pmc=348267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
Imaging of biophotons from leaves has been used as a method for Assaying R Gene Responses. These genes and their associated proteins are responsible for [[pathogen]] recognition and activation of defense signaling networks leading to the hypersensitive response,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1094/MPMI-18-0169 |pmid=15720086 |title=Regulation of Enteric Endophytic Bacterial Colonization by Plant Defenses |journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=169 |year=2005 |last1=Iniguez |first1=A. Leonardo |last2=Dong |first2=Yuemei |last3=Carter |first3=Heather D |last4=Ahmer |first4=Brian M. M |last5=Stone |first5=Julie M |last6=Triplett |first6=Eric W }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is one of the mechanisms of the resistance of plants to pathogen infection. It involves the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have crucial roles in [[signal transduction]] or as toxic agents leading to cell death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jxb/erl215 |pmid=17158510 |title=Highly sensitive determination of transient generation of biophotons during hypersensitive response to cucumber mosaic virus in cowpea |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=465 |year=2006 |last1=Kobayashi |first1=M |last2=Sasaki |first2=K |last3=Enomoto |first3=M |last4=Ehara |first4=Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biophoton have been observed in stressed plant's roots, too. In healthy cells, the concentration of ROS is minimized by a system of biological antioxidants. However, heat shock and other stresses changes the equilibrium between oxidative stress and antioxidant activity, for example, the rapid rise in temperature induces biophoton emission by ROS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0105700 |pmid=25153902 |title=Biophoton Emission Induced by Heat Shock |journal=PLOS One |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=e105700 |year=2014 |last1=Kobayashi |first1=Katsuhiro |last2=Okabe |first2=Hirotaka |last3=Kawano |first3=Shinya |last4=Hidaka |first4=Yoshiki |last5=Hara |first5=Kazuhiro |bibcode=2014PLoSO...9j5700K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical biophysics==

===Hypothesized involvement in cellular communication===
In the 1920s, the Russian embryologist [[Alexander Gurwitsch]] reported "ultraweak" photon emissions from living tissues in the UV-range of the spectrum. He named them "mitogenetic rays" because his experiments convinced him that they had a stimulating effect on [[cell division]].&lt;ref name=pmid3294029&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3294029 |year=1988 |author1=Gurwitsch |first1=A. A |title=A historical review of the problem of mitogenetic radiation |journal=Experientia |volume=44 |issue=7 |pages=545–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biophotons were claimed to have been employed by the Stalin regime to diagnose [[cancer]]. The method has not been tested in the West. However, failure to replicate his findings and the fact that, though cell growth can be stimulated and directed by [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] this is possible only at much higher amplitudes, evoked a general skepticism about Gurwitsch's work. In 1953 [[Irving Langmuir]] dubbed Gurwitsch's Mitogenetic Rays [[pathological science]]. Commercial products, therapeutic claims and services supposedly based on his work appear at present to be best regarded as such.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

But in the later 20th century Gurwitsch's daughter Anna, Colli, Quickenden and Inaba separately returned to the subject, referring to the phenomenon more neutrally as "dark luminescence", "low level luminescence", "ultraweak bioluminescence", or "ultraweak chemiluminescence".{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Their common basic hypothesis was that the phenomenon was induced from rare [[oxidation]] processes and [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] [[chemical reaction|reactions]].

In the 1970s [[Fritz-Albert Popp]] and his research group at the [[University of Marburg]] ([[Germany]]) showed that the spectral distribution of the emission fell over a wide range of wavelengths, from 200 to 750&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000083763 |title=An Introduction to Human Biophoton Emission |journal=Complementary Medicine Research |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=77 |year=2005 |last1=Wijk |first1=Roeland Van |last2=Wijk |first2=Eduard P.A. Van }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popp proposed that the radiation might be both semi-[[period (physics)|periodic]] and [[coherence (physics)|coherent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ignatov|first=Ignat|last2=Mosin|first2=Oleg|last3=Stoyanov|first3=Chavdar|date=2014|title=Biophysical Fields.

One biophoton mechanism focuses on injured cells that are under higher levels of [[oxidative stress]], which is one source of light, and can be deemed to constitute a "distress signal" or background chemical process is yet to be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many claims with no scientific proof have been made for cures and diagnosis using biophotons.&lt;ref name=Barrett2007&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett, M.D.|first=Stephen|title=Some Notes on the American Academy of  Quantum Medicine (AAQM)|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/aaqm.html|publisher=Quackwatch.org|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appraisal of "biophoton therapy" by the IOCOB&lt;ref name=Iocob2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Biophoton therapy: an appraisal|url=http://www.iocob.nl/english-articles/biophoton-therapy-an-appraisal.html|accessdate=8 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622160159/http://www.iocob.nl/english-articles/biophoton-therapy-an-appraisal.html|archivedate=22 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that biophoton therapy claims to treat a wide variety of diseases, such as malaria, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and depression, but that all these claims remain unproven. F. Popp, a researcher who investigates biophoton emission, concludes that the complexity of cellular chemical reactions in living systems is such that it excludes the possibility to create a machine to selectively heal systems using biophotons, but there are always people who believe in these "miracles."&lt;ref name=Iocob2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biophotons and biontology|url=http://www.iocob.nl/energetisch/biofotonen.html|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum medicine===

This claims:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] level possesses the highest level of [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]] within the human organism. Sick individuals with weak immune systems or cancer have poor and chaotic coherence with disturbed biophoton cellular communication. Therefore, disease can be seen as the result of disturbances on the cellular level that act to distort the cell's quantum perspective. This causes electrons to become misplaced in protein molecules and metabolic processes become derailed as a result. Once cellular metabolism is compromised the cell becomes isolated from the regulated process of natural growth control."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Linsteadt, N.D, published in an ANMA newsletter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A review of the ''[[American Academy of Quantum Medicine]]'' concludes that many quantum medicine practitioners are not licensed as health care professionals, that quantum medicine uses scientific terminology but is nonsense, and that the practitioners have created "a nonexistent 'energy system' to help peddle products and procedures to their clients."&lt;ref name=Barrett2007 /&gt;

'''Cavity optomechanics''' is a branch of [[physics]] which focuses on the interaction between light and mechanical objects on low-energy scales. It is a cross field of [[optics]], [[quantum optics]], [[solid-state physics]] and [[materials science]]. The motivation for research on cavity optomechanics comes from fundamental effects of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[gravity]], as well as technological applications.

The name of the field relates to the main effect of interest, which is the enhancement of [[Radiation pressure|radiation pressure interaction]] between light ([[photon]]s) and matter using [[Optical cavity|optical resonators (cavities)]]. It first became relevant in the context of [[gravitational wave]] detection, since optomechanical effects have to be taken into account in [[interferometric gravitational wave detector]]s. Furthermore, one may envision optomechanical structures to allow the realization of [[Schrödinger's cat]]. Macroscopic objects consisting of billions of atoms share collective degrees of freedom which may behave quantum mechanically, e.g. a sphere of micrometer diameter being in a spatial [[Superposition principle|superposition]] between two different places. Such a quantum state of motion would allow to experimentally investigate [[decoherence]], which describes the process of objects transitioning between states which are described by quantum mechanics to states which are described by [[Newtonian mechanics]]. Optomechanical structures pave a new way for testing the predictions of quantum mechanics and decoherence models and thereby might allow to answer some of the most fundamental questions in modern physics.

There is a broad range of experimental optomechanical systems which are almost equivalent in their description, but completely different in size, mass and frequency, ranging from attograms and gigahertz to kilograms and hertz. Cavity optomechanics was featured as the most recent ''milestone of photon history''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/milestones/milephotons/full/milephotons23.html&lt;/ref&gt; in nature photonics along well established concepts and technology like [[Quantum information]], [[Bell inequalities]] and the [[laser]].

== Concepts of cavity optomechanics ==

===Physical processes===
The most elementary light-matter interaction is the light beam scattering off an arbitrary object (atom, molecule, nanobeam etc.). There is always elastic light scattering, with the outgoing light frequency identical to the incoming frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega'=\omega&lt;/math&gt;. Inelastic scattering, in contrast, will be accompanied by excitation or de-excitation of the material object (e.g. internal atomic transitions may be excited). However, independent of the internal electronic details of the atoms or molecules, it is always possible to have [[Raman scattering]] due to the object's mechanical vibrations: 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega'=\omega\pm\omega_m&lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt;\omega_m&lt;/math&gt; is the vibrational frequency. The vibrations gain or lose energy, respectively, for these [[Stokes shift|Stokes/anti-Stokes processes]], while optical sidebands are created around the incoming light frequency, i.e.  
:&lt;math&gt;\omega'=\omega\mp\omega_m&lt;/math&gt;. 
If both of these processes (Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering) occur at an equal rate, the vibrations will merely heat up the object. However, one may use an [[optical cavity]] to suppress e.g. the Stokes process. This reveals the principle of the basic optomechanical setup: A laser-driven optical cavity is coupled to the mechanical vibrations of some object. This is a very generic setting. The purpose of the cavity is to select optical frequencies (e.g. to suppress the Stokes process), to resonantly enhance the light intensity and to enhance the sensitivity to the mechanical vibrations. This setup displays features of a true two-way interaction between light and mechanics. This is in contrast to [[optical tweezers]], [[optical lattice]]s, or vibrational spectroscopy, where the light field controls the mechanics (or vice versa) but the loop is not closed.

Another but equivalent way to interpret the principle of optomechanical cavities is by using the concept of [[radiation pressure]]. According to the quantum theory of light, every photon with wave number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; carries a momentum &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k&lt;/math&gt; with Planck's constant &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;. This means that a photon, which is reflected off a mirror surface, transfers a momentum &lt;math&gt;\Delta p=2\hbar k&lt;/math&gt; onto the mirror due to the [[conservation of momentum]]. This effect is extremely small and can not be observed on most every-day objects, however it becomes more significant when the mass of the mirror is very small and/or the number of photons is very large (i.e. high intensity of the light). Since the momentum of photons is extremely small and not enough to change the position of a suspended mirror significantly, one needs to enhance the interaction. One possible way to do this is by using optical cavities. If a photon is enclosed between two mirrors, one being the oscillator and the other a heavy fixed one, it will bounce off the mirrors many times and transfer its momentum every time it hits the mirrors. The number of times a photon can transfer its momentum is directly related to the [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer|finesse]] of the cavity, which can be improved with highly reflective mirror surfaces. To understand why this radiation pressure of the photons does not simply shift the suspended mirror further and further away, one has to take into account the effect on the cavity light field: If the mirror is displaced, the cavity becomes longer (or shorter) which changes the cavity resonance frequency. Thus the detuning between the changed cavity and the unchanged laser driving frequency is modified. This detuning determines the light amplitude inside the cavity - at smaller detuning more light actually enters the cavity, because it is closer to the cavity resonance frequency. Since the light amplitude, i.e. the number of photons inside the cavity, causes the radiation pressure force and thus the displacement of the mirror we have closed the loop: The radiation pressure force effectively depends on the mirror position. Another advantage of optical cavities is that the modulation of the cavity length through an oscillating mirror can directly be seen in the spectrum of the cavity.

Some first effects of the light on the mechanical resonator can be captured by converting the radiation pressure force into a potential, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}V_{rad}(x)=-F(x)&lt;/math&gt;, 
and adding it to the intrinsic [[quantum harmonic oscillator|harmonic oscillator]] potential of the mechanical oscillator. This combined potential reveals the possibility of static multi-stability in the system, i.e. the potential can feature several stable minima. In addition, the slope of the radiation pressure force &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be understood as a modification of the mechanical spring constant, 
:&lt;math&gt;D=D_{0}-\frac{dF}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. 
This effect is known as ''optical spring effect'' (light-induced spring constant).

However, this picture is not complete, as it neglects retardation effects due to the finite cavity photon decay rate &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. The force follows the motion of the mirror only with some time delay. This leads to effects such as friction. For example, let us assume the equilibrium position sit somewhere on the rising slope of the resonance. In thermal equilibrium, there will be oscillations around this position, which do not follow the shape of the resonance because of retardation. The consequence of this delayed radiation force during one cycle of oscillation turns out to be that work is carried out, in this particular case it is negative,&lt;math&gt;\oint Fdx&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the radiation force extracts mechanical energy (there is extra, light-induced damping). This can be used to cool down the mechanical motion and is referred to as optical or optomechanical cooling. It is important for reaching the quantum regime of the mechanical oscillator where thermal noise effects on the device become negligible. Similarly, if the equilibrium position sits on the falling slope of the cavity resonance, the work is positive and the mechanical motion is amplified. In this case the extra, light-induced damping is negative and leads to amplification of the mechanical motion (heating). Radiation-induced damping of this kind has first been observed in pioneering experiments by Braginsky and coworkers in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Braginskii, V. B., Manukin, A. B., Tikhonov, M. Yu. (1970). Investigation of dissipative pondermotive effects of electromagnetic radiation. Soviet Physics JETP Vol 31, 5 (original russian: Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 58, 1549 (1970))&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation for the basic optomechanical effects of cooling and amplification can be given in a quantized picture. By detuning the incoming light from the cavity resonance to the red sideband, the photons can only enter the cavity if they take [[phonons]] with energy &lt;math&gt;\hbar\omega_m&lt;/math&gt; from the mechanics. This effectively cools the device until a balance with heating mechanisms from the environment and laser noise is reached. In the same fashion it is also possible to heat structures (amplify the mechanical motion) by detuning the driving laser to the blue side. In this case the laser photons scatter into a cavity photon and create an additional phonon in the mechanical oscillator.

In general, one can divide the basic behaviour of the optomechanical system into different regimes, depending on the detuning between the laser frequency and the cavity resonance frequency, 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta=\omega_L-\omega_{cav}&lt;/math&gt;:

* ''Red-detuned regime'' &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; (most prominent effects on the red sideband &lt;math&gt;\Delta=-\omega_m&lt;/math&gt;): In this regime state exchange between two resonant oscillators can occur (i.e. a beam-splitter in quantum optics language). This can be used for state transfer between phonons and photons (which requires the so-called ”strong coupling regime”) or the above-mentioned optical cooling.
* ''Blue-detuned regime'' &lt;math&gt;\Delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; (most prominent effects on the blue sideband &lt;math&gt;\Delta=+\omega_m&lt;/math&gt;): This regime describes "two-mode squeezing". It can be used to achieve [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]], [[Squeezed coherent state|squeezing]], and mechanical "lasing" (amplification of the mechanical motion to self-sustained optomechanical oscillations / [[limit cycle]] oscillations), if the growth of the mechanical energy overwhelms the intrinsic losses (mainly mechanical friction).
* ''On-resonance regime'' &lt;math&gt;\Delta=0&lt;/math&gt;: In this regime the cavity is simply operated as an [[interferometry|interferometer]], so it can be used to read out the mechanical motion.

Also the optical spring effect depends on the detuning. It can be observed for large detuning &lt;math&gt;\Delta\gg\omega_m,\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and its strength varies with detuning and the laser drive.

===Mathematical treatment===

====Hamiltonian====
The standard optomechanical setup is a Fabry–Pérot cavity, where one mirror is movable and thus provides an additional mechanical degree of freedom. Mathematically this system can be described by a single optical cavity mode coupled to a single mechanical mode. The coupling originates from the radiation pressure of the light field, that eventually moves the mirror a little bit, thus changing the cavity length and resonance frequency. The optical mode is driven by an external laser. This system can be described by the following effective Hamiltonian&lt;ref&gt;Law, C. (1994). Effective Hamiltonian for the radiation in a cavity with a moving mirror and a time-varying dielectric medium. Physical Review A, 49(1), 433-437. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevA.49.433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; H_{tot} = \hbar \omega_{cav}(x) a^\dagger a + \hbar \omega_m b^\dagger b + i \hbar E \left( a e^{i\omega_L t} - a^\dagger e^{-i\omega_L t}\right)  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are the bosonic annihilation operators of the given cavity mode and the mechanical resonator respectively, satisfying the commutation relations 
:&lt;math&gt;[a, a^\dagger] = [b, b^\dagger] = 1&lt;/math&gt;. 
&lt;math&gt;\omega_{cav}&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the optical mode, now dependant on the position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the mechanical resonator, whereas &lt;math&gt;\omega_m&lt;/math&gt; is the mechanical mode frequency. The last term describes the driving, with &lt;math&gt;\omega_L&lt;/math&gt; the driving laser frequency and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; the amplitude, given by 
:&lt;math&gt;E = \sqrt{\frac{P \kappa}{\hbar \omega_L}}&lt;/math&gt; 
with &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; the input power coupled to the optical mode under consideration and &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; its linewidth. Of course, the system is coupled to the environment so the full treatment of the system should also include optical and mechanical dissipation (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; respectively) and the corresponding noise entering the system.

The standard optomechanical Hamiltonian is obtained by getting rid of the explicit time dependence of the laser driving term and separating the optomechanical interaction from the free optical oscillator. This is achieved by switching into a reference frame rotating at the laser frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_L&lt;/math&gt; (in which case the optical mode annihilation operator undergoes the transformation
&lt;math&gt; a \rightarrow a e^{-i\omega_L t}&lt;/math&gt;) and applying a [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]] on &lt;math&gt;\omega_{cav}&lt;/math&gt;. Quadratic and higher order coupling terms are usually neglected, such that the standard Hamiltonian becomes

:&lt;math&gt;H_{tot} = -\hbar \Delta a^\dagger a + \hbar \omega_m b^\dagger b - \hbar g_0  a^\dagger a \frac{x}{x_{zpf}}+ i\hbar E \left( a - a^\dagger \right)&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\Delta = \omega_L - \omega_{cav}&lt;/math&gt; the laser detuning and the position operator &lt;math&gt; x = x_{zpf}(b + b^\dagger)&lt;/math&gt;.
The first two terms are the free optical and mechanical Hamiltonian respectively. The third term contains the optomechanical interaction, with &lt;math&gt;g_0 = \left.\tfrac{d\omega_{cav}}{dx}\right|_{x=0}x_{zpf}&lt;/math&gt; the single-photon optomechanical coupling strength (sometimes also called the bare optomechanical coupling). It determines by how much the cavity resonance frequency is shifted if the mechanical oscillator is displaced by the zero point uncertainty &lt;math&gt;x_{zpf}=\sqrt{\hbar/2m_{eff}\omega_m}&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;m_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; is the effective mass of the mechanical oscillator. Sometimes, it is more convenient to use &lt;math&gt;G=g_0/x_{zpf}&lt;/math&gt; instead, which determines the frequency change per displacement of the mirror, also called frequency pull parameter.

E.g., for a Fabry–Pérot cavity of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with a moving end-mirror the optomechanical coupling strength can directly be determined from the geometry to be &lt;math&gt;g_0 = \omega_{cav}(0) x_{zpf}/L&lt;/math&gt;.

This mathematical description using &lt;math&gt;H_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; is based on the assumption that only one optical and mechanical mode interact. Each optical cavity supports in principle an infinite number of modes and mechanical oscillators have more than a single oscillation/vibration mode. The validity of this approach relies on the possibility to tune the laser in such a way, that it populates a single optical mode only (that implies that the [[free spectral range|spacing between the cavity modes]] needs to be sufficiently large). Furthermore, scattering of photons to other modes is supposed to be negligible, which holds if the mechanical (motional) sidebands of the driven mode do not overlap with other cavity modes, i.e. if the mechanical mode frequency is smaller than the typical separation of the optical modes.

====Linearization====
Usually, the single-photon optomechanical coupling strength &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; is a small frequency, much smaller than the cavity decay rate &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, but the effective optomechanical coupling can be enhanced by increasing the drive power. Namely, with a strong enough drive, the dynamics of the system can be considered as quantum fluctuations around a classical steady state, i.e. &lt;math&gt;a = \alpha + \delta a&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the mean light field amplitude and &lt;math&gt;\delta a&lt;/math&gt; denotes the fluctuations. Expanding the photon number &lt;math&gt;a^\dagger a&lt;/math&gt;, we can omit the term &lt;math&gt;~\alpha^2&lt;/math&gt; as it leads to a constant radiation pressure force which simply shifts the resonator's equilibrium position. Also neglecting the second order term &lt;math&gt;~\delta a^\dagger \delta a&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the ''linearized'' optomechanical Hamiltonian,

&lt;math&gt;H_{lin} = -\hbar\Delta \delta a^\dagger \delta a + \hbar\omega_m b^\dagger b - \hbar g (\delta a + \delta a^\dagger)(b + b^\dagger)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g = g_0 \alpha&lt;/math&gt;. This Hamiltonian is quadratic in operators, but it is called ''linearized'', because it leads to linear equations of motion. It is a valid description of many experiments, where &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; is typically very small and needs to be enhanced by the driving laser. Again, for a realistic description dissipation should be added to both the optical and the mechanical oscillator. The driving term from the standard Hamiltonian is not part of the linearized Hamiltonian, since it is the source of the classical light amplitude &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; around which the linearization was executed.

With a particular choice of detuning, different phenomena can be observed (see also the section about [[Cavity optomechanics#Physical processes|physical processes]]). The clearest distinction can be made between the following three cases:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta\approx-\omega_m&lt;/math&gt;:  In this case a [[rotating wave approximation]] of the linearized Hamiltonian, where one omits all non-resonant terms, reduces the coupling Hamiltonian to a beamsplitter operator, &lt;math&gt;H_{int}=\hbar g_0(\delta a^\dagger b + \delta a b^\dagger)&lt;/math&gt;. This approximation works best on resonance, i.e. if the detuning becomes exactly equal to the negative mechanical frequency. Negative detuning (red detuning of the laser from the cavity resonance) by an amount equal to the mechanical mode frequency favors the anti-Stokes sideband, leading to a net cooling of the resonator. Laser photons absorb energy from the mechanical oscillator by annihilating phonons in order to become resonant with the cavity.

&lt;math&gt;\Delta \approx \omega_m&lt;/math&gt;: In this case a [[rotating wave approximation]] of the linearized Hamiltonian leads to other resonant terms. The coupling Hamiltonian takes the form &lt;math&gt;H_{int}= \hbar g_0(\delta a b + \delta a^\dagger b^\dagger)&lt;/math&gt;, which is proportional to the two-mode squeezing operator. Therefore, two-mode squeezing and entanglement between the mechanical and optical modes can be observed with this parameter choice. Positive detuning (blue detuning of the laser from the cavity resonance) can also lead to instability. In the mechanical sideband picture, this corresponds to enhancing the Stokes sideband, i.e. the laser photons shed energy, increasing the number of phonons and becoming resonant with the cavity in the process.

&lt;math&gt;\Delta = 0&lt;/math&gt;: In this case of driving on-resonance, one has to consider all terms in &lt;math&gt;H_{int} =\hbar g_0 (\delta a + \delta a^\dagger) (b+b^\dagger)&lt;/math&gt;. The optical mode experiences a shift proportional to the mechanical displacement, which translates into a phase shift of the light transmitted through (or reflected off) the cavity. Thus, the cavity serves as an interferometer augmented by the factor of the optical finesse and can be used to measure very small displacements. (In fact, this setup has recently enabled LIGO to detect gravitational waves.)

====Equations of motion====
From the linearized Hamiltonian one can, adding dissipation and noise terms to the [[Heisenberg picture|Heisenberg equations of motion]], derive the so-called linearized quantum [[Langevin equation]]s, which govern the dynamics of the optomechanical system.

&lt;math&gt;\delta \dot{a} =  (i \Delta-\kappa/2) \delta a + i g (b+b^\dagger) - \sqrt{\kappa} a_{in} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dot b = -(i\omega_m+\Gamma/2)b +i g (\delta a+\delta a^\dagger)-\sqrt{\Gamma}b_{in}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;a_{in}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_{in}&lt;/math&gt; are the input noise operators (either quantum or thermal noise) and &lt;math&gt;-\kappa \delta a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\Gamma \delta p&lt;/math&gt; are the corresponding dissipative terms. Note that for optical photons, thermal noise can be neglected due to the high frequencies, such that the optical input noise can be described by quantum noise only (this does not hold for microwave implementations of the optomechanical system). For the mechanical oscillator thermal noise has to be taken into account and is the reason why many experiments are placed in additional cooling environments to lower the ambient temperature.

Rewritten in [[Frequency domain|frequency space]] (i.e. a [[Fourier transform]] is applied), these first order differential equations become easily solvable.

Two main effects of the light on the mechanical oscillator can then be expressed in the following way:[[File:OptomechanicalDamping.png|thumb|The optically induced damping of the mechanical oscillator that adds to the intrinsic mechanical damping.]]

&lt;math&gt;\delta\omega_m=g^2\left(\frac{\Delta-\omega_m}{\kappa^2/4+(\Delta-\omega_m)^2}+\frac{\Delta+\omega_m}{\kappa^2/4+(\Delta+\omega_m)^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma^{eff} = \Gamma + g^2\left(\frac{\kappa}{\kappa^2/4+(\Delta+\omega_m)^2}-\frac{\kappa}{\kappa^2/4+(\Delta-\omega_m)^2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The former is termed the optical-spring effect and may lead to significant frequency shifts in the case of low-frequency oscillators, such as pendulum mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Genes, C., Vitali, D., Tombesi, P., Gigan, S., Aspelmeyer, M. (2008) Physical Review A 77,
033804 {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevA.77.033804}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corbitt, T. et al., Physical Review Letters 98, 150802 (2007) {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.150802}}; T. Corbitt et al., ibid. 99,160801 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of higher resonance frequencies, &lt;math&gt;\omega_m \gtrsim 1&lt;/math&gt; MHz, it does not significantly alter the frequency. For a harmonic oscillator, the relation between a frequency shift and a change in the spring constant originates from [[Hooke's law#Harmonic oscillator|Hooke's law]].

The latter equation shows optical damping, i.e. the intrinsic mechanical damping &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; becomes stronger (or weaker) due to the optomechanical interaction. From the formula one can see that for negative detuning and large coupling, the mechanical damping can be greatly increased, which corresponds to cooling of the mechanical oscillator. In the case of positive detuning the optomechanical interaction leads to a negative contribution to the effective damping. This can lead to instability, when the effective damping drops below zero, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{eff}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, which means that it turns into an overall amplification rather than a damping of the mechanical oscillator.

===Important parameter regimes===
The most basic regimes in which the optomechanical system can be operated are defined by the laser detuning &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; and described above. The resulting phenomenas are basically either cooling or heating of the mechanical oscillator. However, additional parameters determine what effects can actually be observed.

The ''good/bad cavity regime'' (also called the ''resolved/unresolved sideband regime'') relates the mechanical frequency to the optical linewidth: The good cavity regime (resolved sideband limit) is of experimental relevance since it is a necessary requirement to achieve [[ground-state]] cooling of the mechanical oscillator, i.e. cooling to an average mechanical occupation number below &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The name "resolved sideband regime" refers to the possibility to distinguish the motional sidebands from the cavity resonance, which is the case if the linewidth of the cavity, &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than the distance from the cavity resonance to the sideband, which is &lt;math&gt;\omega_m&lt;/math&gt;. This requirement leads to a condition for the so-called sideband parameter: &lt;math&gt;\omega_m/\kappa\gg1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\omega_m/\kappa\ll1&lt;/math&gt; the system resides in the bad cavity regime (unresolved sideband limit). Here, the motional sideband lies within the peak of the cavity resonance. Actually, deep in the unresolved sideband regime, many motional sidebands can be included in the broad cavity linewidth, thus e.g. allowing a single photon to create more than one phonon, which leads to larger amplification of the mechanical oscillator.

Another distinction can be made depending on the optomechanical coupling strength. If the (enhanced) optomechanical coupling becomes larger than the cavity linewidth, &lt;math&gt;g\geq\kappa&lt;/math&gt; one enters the so-called ''strong-coupling regime''. There the optical and mechanical modes hybridize and normal-mode splitting occurs. This regime has to be distinguished from the (experimentally much more challenging) ''single-photon strong-coupling regime'', where the bare optomechanical coupling becomes of the order of the cavity linewidth, &lt;math&gt;g_0\geq\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. Only in this regime, effects of the full non-linear interaction described by &lt;math&gt; \hbar g_0 a^\dagger a (b+b^\dagger)&lt;/math&gt; become observable. For example, it is a precondition to create non-Gaussian states with the optomechanical system. Typical experiments currently operate in the linearized regime (small &lt;math&gt;g_0\ll\kappa&lt;/math&gt;) thus investigating only effects of the linearized Hamiltonian.

==Experimental realizations==

(c) A mechanically compliant aluminum capacitor used to form a superconducting LC oscillator. ]]
The strength of the optomechanical Hamiltonian is the large range of experimental implementations to which it can be applied. This results in wide parameter ranges for the optomechanical parameters. For example, the size of optomechanical systems can be micrometers but also of the order of kilometers as it is the case for [[LIGO]] (although LIGO is dedicated to the detection of gravitational waves and not the investigation of optomechanics specifically).

Examples of real optomechanical implementations are:
* ''Cavities with a moving mirror'': This is the archetype of an optomechanical system. The light is reflected from the mirrors, transferring momentum onto the movable one, which in turn changes the cavity resonance frequency.
* ''Membrane-in-the-middle system'':&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. D., Zwickl, B. M., Jayich, A. M., Marquardt, F., Girvin, S. M., &amp; Harris, J. G. E. (2008). Strong dispersive coupling of a high-finesse cavity to a micromechanical membrane. ''Nature'', 452(7183), 72-5. Nature Publishing Group. {{doi|10.1038/nature06715}}&lt;/ref&gt; A membrane is brought into a cavity consisting of fixed massive mirrors. The membrane takes now the role of the mechanical oscillator. Depending on the positioning of the membrane inside the cavity this system behaves like the typical optomechanical system.
* ''Microtoroids'' that support an optical [[Whispering-gallery wave|whispering gallery mode]] can be either coupled to a mechanical mode of the toroid &lt;ref&gt;Verhagen, E., Deléglise, S., Weis, S., Schliesser, A., Kippenbergm T.

''Nature'', 472, 69 {{doi|10.1038/nature09933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patterned dielectrics can confine both optical and mechanical (acoustic) modes in the same area, which leads to an optomechanical interaction. 
* ''Electromechanical implementations'' of an optomechanical system use superconducting [[LC circuit]]s with a mechanically compliant capacitance using e.g. a micromechanical membrane.&lt;ref&gt;Teufel, J. D., Donner, T., Dale Li, Harlow, J. W., Allman, M. S., K. Cicak, K.,  Sirois, A. J., Whittaker, J. D., Lehnert, K. W. &amp; Simmonds, R. W.  (2011). Sideband cooling of micro mechanical motion to the quantum ground state. Nature, 475, 359-363. Nature Publishing Group. {{doi|10.1038/nature10261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the role of the optical light is replaced by microwaves. Physics is exactly the same as in optical cavities but the range of parameters is different.

One purpose of studying so many different designs of the same system is the different parameter regimes that are accessible by different setups and their different potential to be converted into tools of commercial use.

===Measurement===
The optomechanical system can be measured using e.g. a [[homodyne detection]] scheme. Either the light of the driving laser is measured, or a two-mode scheme is followed where a strong laser is used to drive the optomechanical system into the state of interest and a second laser is used for the read-out of the state of the system. This second “probe” laser is typically weak, i.e. its optomechanical interaction can be neglected as compared to the effects caused by the strong “pump” laser.

The optical output field can also be measured with single photon detectors e.g. to achieve photon counting statistics.

==Relation to fundamental research==
One of the questions which are still subject to current debate is the exact mechanism of decoherence. As Schrödinger pointed out, we would never see something like a cat in a quantum state. There needs to be something like a collapse of the quantum wave functions, which brings it from a quantum state to a pure classical state. Now one can ask where the boundary lies between objects with quantum properties and classical objects. Taking spatial superpositions as an example, there might be a size limit to objects which can be brought into superpositions, there might be a limit to the spatial separation of the centers of mass of a superposition or even a limit to the superposition of gravitational fields and its impact on small test masses. Those predictions could be checked with large mechanical structures which can be manipulated at the quantum level.&lt;ref&gt;Bose, S., Jacobs, K., &amp; Knight, P. (1999).

==Applications==

Years before cavity optomechanics gained the status of an independent field of research, many of its techniques were already used in [[Gravitational wave detector]]s where it is necessary to measure displacements of mirrors on the order of the Planck scale. Even if these detectors do not address the measurement of quantum effects, they encounter related issues ([[Shot noise#In optics|photon shot noise]]) and use similar tricks ([[squeezed coherent states]]) to enhance the precision. Further applications include the development of quantum memory for [[quantum computer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Cole, G. D., &amp; Aspelmeyer, M. (2011). Cavity optomechanics: Mechanical memory sees the light. Nature nanotechnology, 6, 690. {{doi|10.1038/nnano.2011.199}}&lt;/ref&gt; high precision sensors (e.g. [[Accelerometer|acceleration sensors]]&lt;ref&gt;Krause, A. G., Winger, M., Blasius, T. D., Lin, Q. &amp; Painter, O. A high-resolution microchip optomechanical accelerometer. Nature Photonics (2012). {{doi|10.1038/nphoton.2012.245}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and quantum transducers e.g. between the optical and the microwave domain&lt;ref&gt;Bochmann, J., Vainsencher, A., Awschalom, D. D., Cleland, A. N. (2013). Nanomechanical coupling between microwave and optical photons. ''Nature Physics'' 9, 712-716 {{doi|10.1038/nphys2748}}&lt;/ref&gt; (taking advantage of the fact that the mechanical oscillator can easily couple to both frequency regimes).

==Related fields and expansions==
In addition to the above explained standard cavity optomechanics there exist variations of this simplest model:
* ''pulsed optomechanics:''  The continuous laser driving is replaced by a pulsed driving scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Palomaki, T.A., Teufel, J. D., Simmonds, R. W., Lehnert, K. W. (2013). ''Science'' 342, 6159, 710-713&lt;/ref&gt; This has, for example, advantages when creating entanglement and allows backaction-evading measurements. 
* ''quadratic coupling:'' Going beyond the linear coupling term &lt;math&gt;g_0= \left.\tfrac{d\omega_{cav}(x)}{dx}\right|_{x=0}x_{zpf}&lt;/math&gt; a system with quadratic optomechanical coupling can be investigated. The interaction Hamiltonian would then feature a term &lt;math&gt;\hbar g_{quad}a^\dagger a(b+b^\dagger)^2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g_{sq}=\frac{1}{2} \left.\tfrac{d^2\omega_{cav}(x)}{dx^2}\right|_{x=0}x_{zpf}^2&lt;/math&gt;. In membrane-in-the-middle setups it is possible to achieve quadratic coupling in the absence of linear coupling by positioning the membrane at an extremum of the standing wave inside the cavity.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. D., Zwickl, B. M., Jayich, A. M., Marquardt, F., Girvin, S. M., &amp; Harris, J. G. E. (2008). Strong dispersive coupling of a high-finesse cavity to a micromechanical membrane. ''Nature'', 452(7183), 72-5. Nature Publishing Group. {{doi|10.1038/nature06715}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible application is to carry out a [[quantum nondemolition measurement]] of the phonon number.
* ''reversed dissipation regime:'' In the standard optomechanical system the mechanical damping is much smaller than the optical damping. However, one can engineer a system where this hierarchy is reversed, i.e. the optical damping is much smaller than the mechanical damping, &lt;math&gt;\kappa\ll\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. As long as one resides within in the linearized regime symmetry implies an inversion of the above described effects: E.g. cooling of the mechanical oscillator in the standard optomechanical system is replaced by cooling of the optical oscillator in a system with reversed dissipation hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Nunnenkamp, A., Sudhir, V, Feofanov, A. K., Roulet, A., Kippenberg, T. J. (2014). Quantum-Limited Amplification and Parametric Instability in the Reversed Dissipation Regime of Cavity Optomechanics ''Physical Review Letters'', 113, 023604. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.023604}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect was also seen in optical fiber loops in the 1970s.
* ''dissipative coupling:'' Here the coupling between optics and mechanics arises from a position-dependent optical dissipation rate &lt;math&gt;\kappa(x)&lt;/math&gt; (instead of a position-dependent cavity resonance frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_{cav}&lt;/math&gt;). This changes the interaction Hamiltonian and alters many effects of the standard optomechanical system. E.g. this scheme allows to cool the mechanical resonator to its ground state without the requirement of the good cavity regime.&lt;ref&gt;Elste, F., Girvin,. S. M., Clerk, A. A. (2009). Quantum Noise Interference and Backaction Cooling in Cavity Optomechanics ''Physical Review Letters'', 102, 207209. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.207209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensions to the standard optomechanical system include coupling to more and physically different systems:
* ''optomechanical arrays:'' Coupling several optomechanical systems to each other (e.g. using evanescent coupling of the optical modes) one can study multi-mode phenomena (e.g. synchronization,…). So far many theoretical predictions have been made, but only few experiments exist. The first optomechanical array (with more than two coupled systems) consists of 7 optomechanical systems.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, M., Shah, S., Cardenas, J, Lipson, M. (2015). Synchronization and Phase Noise Reduction in Micromechanical Oscillator Arrays Coupled through Light ''Physical Review Letters'', 115, 163902. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.163902}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''hybrid systems:'' An optomechanical system can be coupled to a system of different nature (e.g. a cloud of [[ultracold atoms]], a [[two-level system]],…). This can lead to new effects on both the optomechanical and the additional system.

Cavity optomechanics is closely related to [[Trapped ion quantum computer|trapped ion]] physics and [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s. These systems share very similar Hamiltonians, but they have less particles (about 10 for ion traps and &lt;math&gt;10^5&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;10^8&lt;/math&gt; for BECs) interacting with the field of light. It is also related to the field of [[cavity quantum electrodynamics]].

A '''collaboratory''', as defined by [[William Wulf]] in 1989, is a “center without walls, in which the nation’s researchers can perform their research without regard to physical location, interacting with colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational resources, [and] accessing information in [[Digital library|digital libraries]]” (Wulf, 1989).

Bly (1998) refines the definition to “a [[system]] which combines the interests of the scientific community at large with those of the [[computer science]] and [[engineering]] community to create integrated, tool-oriented computing and communication systems to support scientific collaboration” (Bly, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;31).

Rosenberg (1991) considers a collaboratory as being an experimental and [[empirical]] research environment in which scientists work and communicate with each other to design systems, participate in collaborative science, and conduct experiments to evaluate and improve systems.

A simplified form of these definitions would describe the collaboratory as being an environment where participants make use of computing and communication technologies to access shared instruments and data, as well as to communicate with others.

However, a wide-ranging definition is provided by Cogburn (2003) who states that “a collaboratory is more than an elaborate collection of information and communications technologies; it is a new networked organizational form that also includes social processes; collaboration techniques; formal and informal communication; and agreement on norms, principles, values, and rules” (Cogburn, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;86).

This concept has a lot in common with the notions of Interlock research, Information Routing Group and Interlock diagrams introduced in 1984.

'''Other meaning'''

The word “collaboratory” is also used to describe an open space, creative process where a group of people work together to generate solutions to complex problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Collaboratory|url=http://www.greenleaf-publishing.com/productdetail.kmod?productid=3979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This meaning of the word originates from the visioning work of a large group of people – including scholars, artists, consultant, students, activists, and other professionals – who worked together on the 50+20 initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=50+20 initiative|url=http://50plus20.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; aiming at transforming management education.

In this context, by fusing two elements, “collaboration” and “laboratory”, the word “collaboratory” suggests the construction of a space where people explore collaborative innovations. 
It is, as defined by Dr. Katrin Muff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr.Katrin Muff|url=http://www.bsl-lausanne.ch/portfolio/dr-katrin-muff-dean}}&lt;/ref&gt; “an open space for all stakeholders where action learning and action research join forces, and students, educators, and researchers work with members of all facets of society to address current dilemmas.”

The concept of the collaboratory as a creative group process and its application are further developed in the book “The Collaboratory: A co-creative stakeholder engagement process for solving complex problems”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Collaboratory|url=http://www.greenleaf-publishing.com/productdetail.kmod?productid=3979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of collaboratory events are provided on the website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collaboratory community|url=https://collaboratorybook.wordpress.com/explore/part-3-examples-of-the-collaboratory/}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Collaboratory community as well as by [[Business School Lausanne]]- a Swiss business school that has adopted the collaboratory method to harness collective intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collaboratory at Business School Lausanne|url=http://www.bsl-lausanne.ch/news/events-and-conferences/the-collaboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Problems of geographic separation are especially present in large research projects. The time and cost for traveling, the difficulties in keeping contact with other scientists, the control of experimental apparatus, the distribution of information, and the large number of participants in a research project are just a few of the issues researchers are faced with.

Therefore, collaboratories have been put into operation in response to these concerns and restrictions. However, the development and implementation proves to be not so inexpensive. From 1992 to 2000 financial budgets for scientific research and development of collaboratories ranged from [[United States dollar|US$]]447,000 to [[United States dollar|US$]]10,890,000 and the total use ranged from 17 to 215 users per collaboratory (Sonnenwald, 2003). Particularly higher costs occurred when software packages were not available for purchase and direct integration into the collaboratory or when requirements and expectations were not met.

Chin and Lansing (2004) state that the research and development of scientific collaboratories had, thus far, a tool-centric approach. The main goal was to provide tools for shared access and manipulation of specific software systems or scientific instruments. Such an emphasis on tools was necessary in the early development years of scientific collaboratories due to the lack of basic collaboration tools (e.g. text chat, synchronous audio or [[videoconferencing]]) to support rudimentary levels of communication and interaction. Today, however, such tools are available in off-the-shelf software packages such as [[Microsoft NetMeeting]], [[IBM]] [[Lotus Sametime]], [[Mbone]] [[Videoconferencing]] (Chin and Lansing, 2004). Therefore, the design of collaboratories may now move beyond developing general communication mechanisms to evaluating and supporting the very nature of collaboration in the scientific context (Chin &amp; Lansing, 2004).

'''The evolution of the collaboratory'''

As stated in Chapter 4 of the 50+20 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=50+20 initiative|url=http://50plus20.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;"Management Education for the World" book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Education for the World|url=http://50plus20.org/book}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the term collaboratory was first introduced in the late 1980s to address problems of geographic separation in large research projects related to travel time and cost, difficulties in keeping contact with other scientists, control of experimental apparatus, distribution of information, and the large number of participants. In their first decade of use, collaboratories were seen as complex and expensive information and communication technology (ICT) solutions supporting 15 to 200 users per project, with budgets ranging from 0.5 to 10 million USD. At that time, collaboratories were designed from an ICT perspective to serve the interests of the scientific community with tool-oriented computing requirements, creating an environment that enabled systems design and participation in collaborative science and experiments.

The introduction of a user-centered approach provided a first evolutionary step in the design philosophy of the collaboratory, allowing rapid prototyping and development circles. Over the past decade the concept of the collaboratory expanded beyond that of an elaborate ICT solution, evolving into a “new networked organizational form that also includes social processes, collaboration techniques, formal and informal communication, and agreement on norms, principles, values, and rules”. The collaboratory shifted from being a tool-centric to a data-centric approach, enabling data sharing beyond a common repository for storing and retrieving shared data sets. These developments have led to the evolution of the collaboratory towards a globally distributed knowledge work that produces intangible goods and services capable of being both developed and distributed around the world using traditional ICT networks.

Initially, the collaboratory was used in scientific research projects with variable degrees of success. In recent years, collaboratory models have been applied to areas beyond scientific research and the national context. The wide acceptance of collaborative technologies in many parts of the world opens promising opportunities for international cooperation in critical areas where societal stakeholders are unable to work out solutions in isolation, providing a platform for large multidisciplinary teams to work on complex global challenges.

The emergence of open-source technology transformed the collaboratory into its next evolution. The term open-source was adopted by a group of people in the free software movement in Palo Alto in 1998 in reaction to the source code release of the Netscape Navigator browser. Beyond providing a pragmatic methodology for free distribution and access to an end product’s design and implementation details, open-source represents a paradigm shift in the philosophy of collaboration. The collaboratory has proven to be a viable solution for the creation of a virtual organization. Increasingly, however, there is a need to expand this virtual space into the real world. We propose another paradigm shift, moving the collaboratory beyond its existing ICT framework to a methodology of collaboration beyond the tool- and data-centric approaches, and towards an issue-centered approach that is transdisciplinary in nature."

'''The Collaboratory as a creative group process'''

Copyright 50+20 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=50+20 initiative|url=http://50plus20.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;"Management Education for the World" book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Education for the World|url=http://50plus20.org/book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Translating the concept of the collaboratory from the virtual space into a real environment demands a number of significant adjustments, leading us to yet another evolution. While the virtual collaboratory could count on ICT solutions to create and maintain an environment of collaboration, real-life interactions require facilitation experts to create and hold a space for members of the community, jointly developing transdisciplinary solutions around issues of concern. The ability to hold a space is central to the vision of management education.

The technology involved with holding a space implies the ability to create and maintain a powerful and safe learning platform. Such a space invites the whole person (mind, heart, soul and hands) into a place where the potential of a situation is fully realized. Holding a space is deeply grounded in our human heritage, and is still considered an important duty of the elders amongst many indigenous peoples. In Western society, good coaches fulfill a similar role, including the ability to be present in the moment, listening with all senses, being attuned to the invisible potential about to be expressed. As a result, what needs to happen, will happen. Facilitation and coaching experts understand the specific challenges involved in setting up an environment in which a great number of people can meet to discuss solutions that none of them could develop individually. Coaching and facilitation solutions already exist to create and hold such spaces, but are nevertheless distinctly different in a felt sense from the ICT-driven virtual collaboratories we have seen over the past two decades.

The evolution from the virtual collaboratory bears its own challenges and opportunities. In the co-creative process of the 50+20 vision, we learned to appreciate the power of the collaboratory both in real-life retreats as well as interactions between our gatherings. We propose that the next evolutionary step of the collaboratory will include both the broader community of researchers engaged in collaboratories around the world, as well as stakeholders in management education who seek to transform themselves by providing responsible leadership.

In our new definition, a collaboratory is an inclusive learning environment where action learning and action research meet. It involves the active collaboration of a diversified group of participants that bring in different perspectives on a given issue or topic. In such a space, learning and research is organized around issues rather than disciplines or theory. Such issues include: hunger, energy, water, climate change, migration, democracy, capitalism, terrorism, disease, the financial crisis, new economic models, management education that serves the world and similarly pressing matters. These issues are usually complex, messy and hard to resolve, demanding creative, systemic and divergent approaches. The collaboratory’s primary aim is to foster collective creativity.

[[File:The Collaboratory Process - participants.jpg|thumb|Participants in the collaboratory process]]
The collaboratory is a place where people can think, work, learn together, and invent their respective futures. Its facilitators are highly experienced coaches who act as lead learners and guardians of the collaboratory space. They see themselves as transient gatekeepers of a world in need of new solutions. Subject experts are responsible for providing relevant knowledge and contributing it to the discussion in a relevant and pertinent matter. Students will continue to acquire subject knowledge outside the collaboratories – both through traditional and developing channels (such as online or blended learning).

As such, the faculty (of a business school, note added by the editor) is challenged to develop their capacities as facilitators and coaches in order to effectively guide these collaborative learning and research processes. To do this, they must step back from their role as experts and rather serve as facilitators in an open, participative and creative process. Faculty training and development needs to include not only a broad understanding of global issues, but also the development of facilitation and coaching skills.

The circular space of the collaboratory can become the preferred meeting place for citizens to jointly question, discuss and construct new ideas and approaches to resolve environmental, societal and economic challenges on both a regional and global level. Collaboratories should always reflect a rich combination of stakeholders: coaches, business and management faculty, citizens, politicians, entrepreneurs, people from different regions and cultures, youth and elders. Together they assemble differences in perspective, expertise and personal backgrounds, thereby adding a vital creative edge to every encounter, negotiation or problem-solving session."

== Characteristics and considerations ==
A distinctive characteristic of collaboratories is that they focus on data collection and analysis. Hence the interest to apply collaborative technologies to support data sharing as opposed to tool sharing. Chin and Lansing (2004) explore the shift of collaboratory development from traditional tool-centric approaches to more data-centric ones, to effectively support data sharing. This means more than just providing a common repository for storing and retrieving shared [[data set]]s. Collaboration, Chin and Lansing (2004) state, is driven both by the need to share data and to share knowledge about data. Shared data is only useful if sufficient context is provided about the data such that collaborators may comprehend and effectively apply it. It is therefore imperative, according to Chin and Lansing (2004), to know and understand how data sets relate to aspects of overall data space, applications, experiments, projects, and the scientific community, identifying the critical features or properties among which we can mention:

* General data set properties (owner, creation data, size, format);
* Experimental properties (conditions of the scientific experiment that generated that data);
* Data [[provenance]] (relationship with previous versions);
* Integration (relationship of data subsets within the full data set);
* Analysis and interpretation (notes, experiences, interpretations, and knowledge produced)
* Scientific organization (scientific classification or hierarchy);
* Task (research task that generated or applies the data set);
* Experimental process (relationship of data and tasks to the overall process);
* User community (application of data set to different users).

Henline (1998) argues that communication about experimental data is another important characteristic of a collaboratory. By focusing attention on the dynamics of information exchange, the study of Zebrafish Information Network Project (Henline, 1998) concluded that the key challenges in creating a collaboratory may be social rather than technical. “A successful system must respect existing social conventions while encouraging the development of analogous mechanisms within the new electronic forum” (Henline, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;69). Similar observations were made in the [[Computer-supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL) case study (Cogburn, 2003). The author (Cogburn, 2003) is investigating a collaboratory established for researchers in education and other related domains from [[United States of America]] and southern [[Africa]]. The main finding was that there have been important intellectual contributions on both sides, although the context was that of a developed country working together with a developing one and there have been social as well as cultural barriers. He further develops the idea that a successful CSCL would need to draw the best lessons learned on both sides in [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) and [[computer-supported cooperative work]] (CSCW).

Sonnenwald (2003) conducted seventeen interviews with scientists and revealed important considerations. Scientists expect a collaboratory to “support their strategic plans; facilitate management of the scientific process; have a positive or neutral impact on scientific outcomes; provide advantages and disadvantages for scientific task execution; and provide personal conveniences when collaborating across distances” (Sonnenwald, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;68). Many scientists looked at the collaboratory as means to achieve strategic goals that were organizational and personal in nature. Other scientists anticipated that the scientific process would speed up when they had access to the collaboratory.

==Design philosophy==
Finholt (1995), based on the case studies of the Upper Atmospheric Research Collaboratory (UARC) and the Medical Collaboratory, establishes a design philosophy: a collaboratory project must be dedicated to a [[user-centered design]] (UCD) approach. This means a commitment to develop software in programming environments that allow rapid prototyping, rapid development cycles (Finholt, 1995). A consequence of the [[user-centered design]] in the collaboratory is that the system developers must be able to distinguish when a particular system or modification has positive impact on users’ work practices. An important part of obtaining this understanding is producing an accurate picture of how work is done prior to the introduction of technology. Finholt (1995) explains that [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral scientists]] had the task of understanding the actual work settings for which new information technologies were developed. The goal of a [[user-centered design]] effort was to inject those observations back into the design process to provide a baseline for evaluating future changes and to illuminate productive directions for prototype development (Finholt, 1995).

A similar viewpoint is expressed by Cogburn (2003) who relates the collaboratory to a globally distributed [[knowledge worker|knowledge work]], stating that [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) and [[user-centered design]] (UCD) principles are critical for organizations to take advantage of the opportunities of [[globalization]] and the emergence of an [[Information society]]. He (Cogburn, 2003) refers to [[distributed knowledge]] work as being a set of “economic activities that produce intangible goods and services […], capable of being both developed and distributed around the world using the global information and communication networks” (Cogburn, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;81). Through the use of these global information and communications networks, organizations are able to take part in globally disarticulated production, which means they can locate their research and development facilities almost anywhere in the world, and engineers can collaborate across time zones, institutions and national boundaries.

== Evaluation ==
Meeting expectations is a factor that influences adoption of innovations, including scientific collaboratories. Some of the collaboratories implemented thus far have not been entirely successful. The Mathematics and Computer Science Division of Argonne National Laboratory, Waterfall Glen collaboratory (Henline, 1998) is an illustrative example. This collaboratory had its shares of problems. There have been the occasional technical and social disasters, but most importantly it did not meet all of the collaboration and interaction requirements.

The vast majority of the evaluations performed thus far are concentrating mainly on the usage statistics (e.g. total number of members, hours of use, amount of data communicated) or on the immediate role in the production of traditional scientific outcomes (e.g. publications and patents). Sonnenwald (2003), however, argues that we should rather look for longer-term and intangible measures such as new and continued relationship among scientists, and subsequent, longer-term creation of new knowledge.

Regardless of the criteria used for evaluation, we must focus on understanding the expectations and requirements defined for a collaboratory. Without such understanding a collaboratory runs the risk of not being adopted.

== Success factors ==
Olson, Teasley, Bietz, and Cogburn (2002) ascertain some of the success factors of a collaboratory. They are: collaboration readiness, collaboration infrastructure readiness, and collaboration technology readiness.

Collaboration readiness is the most basic pre-requisite for an effective collaboratory, according to Olson, Teasley, Bietz, and Cogburn (2002). Often the critical component to collaboration readiness is based on the concept of “working together in order to achieve a science goal” (Olson, Teasley, Bietz, &amp; Cogburn, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;46). [[Incentive]]s to collaborate, shared principles of collaboration, and experience with the elements of collaboration are also crucial. Successful interaction between users requires a certain amount of common ground. Interactions require a high degree of trust or negotiation, especially when they involve areas where there is a [[cultural difference]]. “Ethical norms tend to be culturally specific, and negotiations about ethical issues require high levels of trust” (Olson, Teasley, Bietz, &amp; Cogburn, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;49).

When analyzing the collaboration infrastructure readiness Olson, Teasley, Bietz, and Cogburn (2002) state that modern collaboration tools require adequate infrastructure to operate properly. Many off-the-shelf applications will run effectively only on state-of-the-art workstations. An important piece of the infrastructure is the technical support necessary to ensure version control, to get participants registered, and to recover in case of disaster. Communications cost is another element which can be critical for collaboration infrastructure readiness (Olson, Teasley, Bietz, &amp; Cogburn, 2002). Pricing structures for network connectivity can affect the choices that users will make and therefore have an effect on the collaboratory’s final design and implementation.

Collaboration technology readiness, according to Olson, Teasley, Bietz, and Cogburn (2002), refers to the fact that collaboration does not involve only technology and infrastructure, but also requires a considerable investment in training. Thus, it is essential to assess the state of technology readiness in the community to ensure success. If the level is too primitive more training is required to bring the users’ knowledge up-to-date.

=== Biological Sciences Collaboratory ===
[[Image:BioSc1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Biological Sciences Collaboratory'' — provides an integrated set of tools, allowing researchers to share data, applications, and communications]]
A comprehensively described example of a collaboratory, the Biological Sciences Collaboratory (BSC) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Chin &amp; Lansing, 2004), enables the sharing and analysis of biological data through [[metadata]] capture, [[Electronic lab notebook|electronic laboratory notebooks]], data organization views, data [[provenance]] tracking, analysis notes, task management, and scientific [[Workflow|workflow management]]. BSC supports various data formats, has data translation capabilities, and can interact and exchange data with other sources (external [[database]]s, for example). It offers subscription capabilities (to allow certain individuals to access data) and verification of identities, establishes and manages permissions and privileges, and has data [[encryption]] capabilities (to ensure secure [[data transmission]]) as part of its security package.

[[Image:BioSc2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Through data provenance, data sets may be traced back to their original sources]]BSC also provides a data [[provenance]] tool and a data organization tool. These tools allow a [[Tree structure|hierarchical tree]] to display the historical lineage of a data set. From this tree-view the scientist may select a particular [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|node]] (or an entire branch) to access a specific version of the data set (Chin &amp; Lansing, 2004).

The [[task management]] provided by BSC allows users to define and track tasks related to a specific experiment or project. Tasks can have deadlines assigned, levels of priority, and dependencies. Tasks can also be [[Information retrieval|queried]] and various reports produced. Related to [[task management]], BSC provides [[Workflow|workflow management]] to capture, manage, and supply standard paths of analyses. The scientific workflow may be viewed as process templates that captures and semi-automate the steps of an analysis process and its encompassing data sets and tools (Chin &amp; Lansing, 2004).

BSC provides project collaboration by allowing scientists to define and manage members of their group. Security and authentication mechanisms are therefore applied to limit access to project data and applications. Monitoring capability allows for members to identify other members that are online working on the project (Chin &amp; Lansing, 2004).

BSC offers community collaboration capabilities: scientists may publish their data sets to a larger community through the [[data portal]]. Notifications are in place for scientists interested in a particular set of data - when that data changes, the scientists get notification via email (Chin &amp; Lansing, 2004).

=== [https://adapt.nd.edu/ Collaboratory for Adaptation to Climate Change] ===

The Collaboratory for Adaptation to [[Climate Change]] is an interdisciplinary project funded by a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]]’s Office of CyberInfrastructure and supported by the [[University of Notre Dame]].

The research mission of the Collaboratory is to improve the dissemination and integration of knowledge that will inform the development of prescient adaptation strategies and policies. Goals of the Collaboratory include:

* Facilitating interactions among researchers and decision makers.
* Providing a vibrant online medium that converts data into knowledge.
* Enabling users to run simulations and visualize future scenarios.
* Providing access to expert opinion as measured via repeated, national surveys.
* Building an information clearinghouse of legal data and regulatory information about adaptation to climate change.

The Collaboratory is not a place for political debate, but is a place for pitching ideas and information with legitimate scientific backing that inform adaptation decisions.

The website is a resource for research, education, and collaboration in the area of adaptation and [[climate change]]. It incorporates a multitude of tools, which take several forms including biological simulation, searchable clearinghouses of legal information, and dissemination of emerging opinion from experts on the benefits and risks of adaptation. These tools can be used individually and in an integrative way to inform decision-making, research, and awareness. The site was created in April 2011 and is under continual development. Check back often for new additions and improvements.

Adaptation, together with reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, is an essential part of solving the climate change crisis. Adaptation includes all of the steps that humans might take to help reduce the effects of climate change that are projected to occur in the 21st century and beyond. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), and international body of scientists, projects that the global climate is likely to shift 2–6&amp;nbsp;°C (4–11&amp;nbsp;°F) warmer within 100 years. That amount of warming will disrupt ecosystems, raise sea levels, and perturb agriculture and human infrastructure. It also will affect human health. We can take steps now to reduce these effects in some instances and places. Adaptation includes, for example, helping species relocate to newly-suitable locations, protecting shores from rising waters and contoling pests that increase or spread under altered conditions. In 2011, Adapt is focused on adaptation for wildlife and biological resources.

===Diesel Combustion Collaboratory ===
Pancerella, Rahn, and Yang (1999) analyzed the Diesel Combustion Collaboratory (DCC) which was a problem-solving environment for combustion research. The main goal of DCC was to make the information exchange for the combustion researchers more efficient. Researchers would collaborate over the Internet using various DCC tools. These tools included “a distributed execution management system for running combustion [[Scientific modelling|models]] on widely distributed computers ([[distributed computing]]), including [[supercomputers]]; web accessible data archiving capabilities for sharing graphical experimental or modeling data; [[Electronic lab notebook|electronic notebooks]] and shared [[workspace]]s for facilitating collaboration; visualization of [[combustion]] data; and [[videoconferencing]] and [[data conferencing]] among researchers at remote sites” (Pancerella, Rahn, &amp; Yang, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;1).

The collaboratory design team defined the requirements to be (Pancerella, Rahn, &amp; Yang, 1999):

* Ability share graphical data easily;
* Ability to discuss [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] strategies and exchange model descriptions;
* Archiving collaborative information;
* Ability to run combustion models at widely separated locations;
* Ability to analyze experimental data and [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] results in a web-accessible format;
* [[Videoconference]] and group meetings capabilities.

Each of these requirements had to be done securely and efficiently across the Internet. Resources availability was a major concern because many of the chemistry simulations could run for hours or even days on high-end workstations and produce [[Kilobytes]] to [[Megabytes]] of data sets. These data sets had to be visualized using simultaneous [[Two-dimensional|2-D]] [[chart|plots]] of multiple variables (Pancerella, Rahn, &amp; Yang, 1999).

The deployment of the DCC was done in a phased approach. The first phase was based on iterative development, testing, and deployment of individual collaboratory tools. Once collaboratory team members had adequately tested each new tool, it was deployed to combustion researchers. The deployment of the infrastructure ([[videoconferencing]] tools, [[multicast]] [[routing]] capabilities, and data archives) was done in parallel (Pancerella, Rahn, &amp; Yang, 1999). The next phase was to implement full security in the collaboratory. The primary focus was on two-way synchronous and multi-way [[Collaborative editing|asynchronous collaborations]] (Pancerella, Rahn, &amp; Yang, 1999). The challenge was to balance the increased access to data that was needed with the security requirements. The final phase was the broadening of the target research to multiple projects including a broader range of collaborators.

The collaboratory team found that the highest impact was perceived by the geographically separated scientists that truly depended on each other to achieve their goals. One of the team’s major challenges was to overcome the technological and social barriers in order to meet all of the objectives (Pancerella, Rahn, &amp; Yang, 1999). User openness and low maintenance security collaboratories are hard to achieve, therefore user feedback and evaluation are constantly required.

=== Other collaboratories ===
Other collaboratories that have been implemented and can be further investigated are:

*[[Marine Biological Laboratory]] (MBL) is an international center for research and education in biology, biomedicine and ecology.
* Biological Collaborative Research Environment (BioCoRE) developed at [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] – a collaboration tool for biologists (Chin and Lansing, 2004);
* The [http://www.teachingquality.org/collaboratory CTQ Collaboratory], a virtual community of teacher leaders and those who value teacher leadership, run by the [http://www.teachingquality.org Center for Teaching Quality], a national education nonprofit (Berry, Byrd, &amp; Wieder, 2013);
* Molecular Interactive Collaborative Environment (MICE) developed at the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]] – provides collaborative access and manipulation of complex, three-dimensional molecular [[Scientific modelling|models]] as captured in various scientific visualization programs (Chin and Lansing, 2004);
* Molecular Modeling Collaboratory (MMC) developed at [[University of California, San Francisco]] – allows remote biologists to share and interactively manipulate three-dimensional molecular [[Scientific modelling|models]] in applications such as drug design and protein engineering (Chin and Lansing, 2004);
* Collaboratory for Microscopic Digital Anatomy (CMDA) – a computational environment to provide biomedical scientists remote access to a specialized research electron microscope (Henline, 1998);
* The Collaboratory for Strategic Partnerships and Applied Research at [[Messiah College]] - an organization of Christian students, educators, and professionals affiliated with Messiah College, aspiring to fulfill Biblical mandates to foster justice, empower the poor, reconcile adversaries, and care for the earth, in the context of academic engagement.
* Waterfall Glen – a multi-user object-oriented (MOO) collaboratory at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] (Henline, 1998);
* The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) – a scientific collaboratory for the development of advanced measures of personality and other individual differences (Henline, 1998);
* TANGO – a set of collaborative applications for education and distance learning, command and control, health care, and computer steering (Henline, 1998).
Special consideration should be attributed to TANGO (Henline, 1998) because it is a step forward in implementing collaboratories, as it has [[distance learning]] and health care as main domains of operation. Henline (1998) mentions that the collaboratory has been successfully used to implement applications for [[distance learning]], command and control center, telemedical bridge, and a remote consulting tool suite.
*[[Collaborative architecture]] and [[Interactive architecture]], the work of [[Adam Somlai-Fischer]] and [[Usman Haque]].
*The Internet &amp; Society Collaboratory supported by Google in Germany

==Summary ==
To date, most collaboratories have been applied largely in scientific research projects, with various degrees of success and failure. Recently, however, collaboratory models have been applied to additional areas of scientific research in both national and international contexts. As a result, a substantial knowledge base has emerged helping us in understanding their development and application in science and industry (Cogburn, 2003). Extending the collaboratory concept to include both social and behavioral research as well as more scientists from the developing world could potentially strengthen the concept and provide opportunities of learning more about the social and technical factors that support a distributed knowledge network (Cogburn, 2003).

The use of collaborative technologies to support geographically distributed scientific research is gaining wide acceptance in many parts of the world. Such collaboratories hold great promise for international cooperation in critical areas of scientific research and not only. As the frontiers of knowledge are pushed back the problems get more and more difficult, often requiring large multidisciplinary teams to make progress. The collaboratory is emerging as a viable solution, using communication and computing technologies to relax the constraints of distance and time, creating an instance of a virtual organization. The collaboratory is both an opportunity with very useful properties, but also a challenge to human organizational practices (Olson, 2002).

'''Disinhibited attachment disorder of childhood''' ('''DAD''') according to the [[International Classification of Diseases]] ([[ICD-10]]), is defined as:

:"A particular pattern of abnormal social functioning that arises during the first five years of life and that tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances, e.g. diffuse, nonselectively focused attachment behaviour, [[attention-seeking]] and indiscriminately friendly behaviour, poorly modulated peer interactions; depending on circumstances there may also be associated emotional or behavioural disturbance." – [http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf90.htm+f942 F94.2] of the ICD-10.

Disinhibited attachment disorder is a subtype of the ICD-10 category F94, "Disorders of social functioning with onset specific to childhood and adolescence". The other subtype of F94 is [[reactive attachment disorder]] of childhood (RAD – F94 .1).

Synonymous or similar disorders include [[Affectionless psychopathy]] and [[Institutional syndrome]].

Within the ICD-10 category scheme, disinhibited attachment disorder specifically excludes [[Asperger syndrome]] (F84.5), hospitalism in children (F43.2), and [[hyperkinetic disorder]]s (F90.-).

==Comparison with the DSM-IV==
The [[DSM-IV]] distinguishes two categories of RAD: an inhibited subtype and a disinhibited subtype (in the DSM it is listed as 313.89 under infant diagnoses). The ICD-10 describes the former, emotionally withdrawn subtype as RAD and the latter subtype as Disinhibited Attachment Disorder (DAD) (Zeanah ''et al.'', 2004).

Generally, the DSM-IV criteria for the inhibited subtype of RAD were generated by studies done on children who were maltreated or abused. Criteria for the DSM-IV disinhibited subtype of RAD were based on research on children raised in institutions (Zeanah, 1996). This is largely based on the fact that inhibited subtype of RAD is more prevalent in maltreated children, and the disinhibited subtype of RAD is more prevalent in children raised in institutions (Zeanah, 2000).

==Studies==
In a study by Zeanah, (Zeanah ''et al.'', 2004) on reactive attachment disorder in maltreated toddlers, the criteria for DSM-IV ''disinhibited'' RAD (i.e. disinhibited attachment disorder) were:

# not having a discriminated, preferred attachment figure, 
# not checking back after venturing away from the caregiver, 
# lack of reticence with unfamiliar adults, 
# a willingness to go off with relative strangers.

For comparison, the criteria for DSM-IV ''inhibited'' RAD were:

# absence of a discriminated, preferred adult,
# lack of comfort seeking for distress,
# failure to respond to comfort when offered,
# lack of social and emotional reciprocity, and
# emotion regulation difficulties.

The authors found that these two disorders were not completely independent; a few children may exhibit symptoms of both types of the disorder.

==History==

Engineering statistics dates back to 1000 B.C. when the [[Abacus]] was developed as means to calculate numerical data. In the 1600s, the development of information processing to systematically analyze and process data began. In 1654, the [[Slide Rule]] technique was developed by [https://www.britannica.com/science/slide-rule#ref81001 Robert Bissaker] for advanced data calculations. In 1833, a British mathematician named [[Charles Babbage]] designed the idea of an automatic computer which inspired developers at [[Harvard University]] and [[IBM]] to design the first mechanical automatic-sequence-controlled calculator called [[harvard mark I|MARK I]]. The integration of computers and calculators into the industry brought about a more efficient means of analyzing data and the beginning of engineering statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica|title=Slide Rule|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/slide-rule#ref81001|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montgomery|first1=Douglas|last2=Runger|first2=George|last3=Hubele|first3=Norma|title=Engineering Statistics|isbn=0470631473|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental history''' is the study of human interaction with the natural world over time, emphasising the active role nature plays in influencing human affairs and vice versa.

Environmental history emerged in the United States out of the [[environmentalism|environmental movement]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and much of its impetus still stems from present-day global environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacEachern|Turkel|2009|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field was founded on conservation issues but has broadened in scope to include more general social and scientific history and may deal with cities, population or [[sustainability|sustainable development]]. As all history occurs in the natural world, environmental history tends to focus on particular time-scales, geographic regions, or key themes. It is also a strongly multidisciplinary subject that draws widely on both the humanities and natural science.

The subject matter of environmental history can be divided into three main components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, nature itself and its change over time, includes the physical impact of humans on the Earth's [[landform|land]], [[water]], [[atmosphere]] and [[biosphere]]. The second category, how humans use nature, includes the environmental consequences of increasing [[population]], more effective [[technology]] and changing patterns of [[Outline of industrial organization|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Other key themes are the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer communities to settled agriculture in the [[neolithic revolution]], the effects of [[colonial expansion]] and [[Human settlement|settlements]], and the environmental and human consequences of the [[industrial revolution|industrial]] and [[technological revolution]]s.&lt;ref name=Grove4&gt;See {{Harvnb|Grove|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, environmental historians study how people think about nature - the way [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[belief]]s and [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s influence interaction with nature, especially in the form of [[myth]]s, [[religion]] and [[science]].

==Origin of name and early works==
{{Main|Roderick Nash}}
In 1967 [[Roderick Nash]] published "''Wilderness and the American Mind''", a work that has become a classic text of early environmental history. In an address to the ''Organization of American Historians'' in 1969 (published in 1970) Nash used the expression "environmental history",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Nash|1970|pp=249–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; although 1972 is generally taken as the date when the term was first coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nash|1972|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1959 book by [[Samuel P. Hays]], ''Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890-1920'', while being a major contribution to American political history, is now also regarded as a founding document in the field of environmental history.  Hays is Professor Emeritus of History at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120426023137/http://www.historyforthefuture.org/wordpress/?p=46 Samuel P. Hays on National Forests and Ecology], ''History for the Future'', [[WRCT]], Pittsburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
Brief overviews of the [[historiography]] of environmental history have been given by [[J. R. McNeill]],&lt;ref name=McNeill3 /&gt; [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|White|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. Donald Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Hughes|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 [[Oxford University Press]] published a volume of 25 essays called ''The Oxford Handbook of Environmental History''.

===Definition===
There is no universally accepted definition of environmental history. In general terms it is a history that tries to explain why our environment is like it is and how humanity has influenced its current condition, as well as commenting on the problems and opportunities of tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dovers|1994|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Worster]]'s widely quoted 1988 definition states that environmental history is the "interaction between human cultures and the environment in the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, J. Donald Hughes defined the subject as the “study of human relationships through time with the natural communities of which they are a part in order to explain the processes of change that affect that relationship”.&lt;ref name=Hughes4&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2001|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2006, as "history that seeks understanding of human beings as they have lived, worked and thought in relationship to the rest of nature through the changes brought by time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As a method, environmental history is the use of ecological analysis as a means of understanding human history...an account of changes in human societies as they relate to changes in the natural environment”.&lt;ref name=Hughes4 /&gt; Environmental historians are also interested in "what people think about nature, and how they have expressed those ideas in folk religions, popular culture, literature and art”.&lt;ref name=Hughes4 /&gt; In 2003, [[J. R. McNeill]] defined it as "the history of the mutual relations between humankind and the rest of nature".&lt;ref name=McNeill3&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2003|pp=5–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subject matter===
Traditional [[history|historical analysis]] has over time extended its range of study from the activities and influence of a few significant people to a much broader social, political, economic, and cultural analysis. Environmental history further broadens the subject matter of conventional history. In 1988, Donald Worster stated that environmental history “attempts to make history more inclusive in its narratives”&lt;ref name=Worster290&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; by examining the “''role and place of nature in human life''”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1993, that “Environmental history explores the ways in which the biophysical world has influenced the course of human history and the ways in which people have thought about and tried to transform their surroundings''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1993|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdependency of human and environmental factors in the creation of landscapes is expressed through the notion of the [[cultural landscape]]. Worster also questioned the scope of the discipline, asking: "''We study humans and nature; therefore can anything human or natural be outside our enquiry?''"&lt;ref name="Worster1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental history is generally treated as a subfield of [[history]]. But some environmental historians challenge this assumption, arguing that while traditional history is human history – the story of people and their institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dovers|1994|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "humans cannot place themselves outside the principles of nature".&lt;ref name=hughes8&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2008|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, they argue that environmental history is a version of human history within a larger context, one less dependent on [[anthropocentrism]] (even though [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] change is at the center of its narrative).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dimensions====
[[File:Penn oil 1864.jpg|thumb|General view of Funkville in 1864, Oil Creek, Pennsylvania, USA]]
J. Donald Hughes responded to the view that environmental history is "''light on theory''" or lacking theoretical structure by viewing the subject through the lens of three "dimensions": nature and culture, history and science, and scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2008|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This advances beyond Worster's recognition of three broad clusters of issues to be addressed by environmental historians although both historians recognize that the emphasis of their categories might vary according to the particular study&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|pp=289–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; as, clearly, some studies will concentrate more on society and human affairs and others more on the environment.

====Themes====
Several themes are used to express these historical dimensions. A more traditional historical approach is to analyse the transformation of the globe’s ecology through themes like the separation of man from nature during the [[neolithic revolution]], [[imperialism]] and [[colonial expansion]], [[exploration]], [[history of agriculture|agricultural change]], the effects of the [[industrial revolution|industrial]] and [[technological revolution]], and [[urban expansion]]. More environmental topics include human impact through influences on [[forestry]], [[fire]], [[climate change]], [[sustainability]] and so on. According to [[Paul Warde]], “''the increasingly sophisticated history of colonization and migration can take on an environmental aspect, tracing the pathways of ideas and species around the globe and indeed is bringing about an increased use of such analogies and ‘colonial’ understandings of processes within European history.''”&lt;ref name="Warde 2007"&gt;See {{Harvnb|Warde|Sorlin|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the colonial enterprise in Africa, the Caribbean and Indian Ocean has been detailed by [[Richard Grove]].&lt;ref name=Grove4 /&gt; 
Much of the literature consists of case-studies targeted at the global, national and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=53–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scale====
Although environmental history can cover billions of years of history over the whole Earth, it can equally concern itself with local scales and brief time periods.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Krech|McNeill|Merchant|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many environmental historians are occupied with local, regional and national histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=53–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians link their subject exclusively to the span of human history – "''every time period in human history''"&lt;ref name=hughes8 /&gt; while others include the period before human presence on Earth as a legitimate part of the discipline. [[Ian Simmons (geographer)|Ian Simmons]]'s ''Environmental History of Great Britain'' covers a period of about 10,000 years. There is a tendency to difference in time scales between natural and social phenomena: the causes of environmental change that stretch back in time may be dealt with socially over a comparatively brief period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dovers|1994|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at all times environmental influences have extended beyond particular geographic regions and cultures, during the 20th and early 21st centuries anthropogenic environmental change has assumed global proportions, most prominently with climate change but also as a result of settlement, the spread of disease and the globalization of world trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Muir and Roosevelt restored.jpg|thumb|left|Nature preservationist [[John Muir]] with U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (left) on [[Glacier Point]] in [[Yosemite National Park]]]]

The questions of environmental history date back to antiquity, including &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=18–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates]], the father of medicine, who asserted that different cultures and human temperaments could be related to the surroundings in which peoples lived in ''Airs, Waters, Places''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars as varied as [[Ibn Khaldun]] and [[Montesquieu]] found climate to be a key determinant of human behavior.&lt;ref name="eolss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeill|first1=J. R.|title=The Historiography of Environmental History|journal=World Environmental History|url=https://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/C09/E6-156-01-00.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], there was a rising awareness of the environment and scientists addressed themes of sustainability via natural history and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750-1800|date=2008 |publisher=Ashgate| url= https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the origins of the subject in its present form are generally traced to the 20th century.

In 1929 a group of French historians founded the journal ''Annales'', in many ways a forerunner of modern environmental history since it took as its subject matter the reciprocal global influences of the environment and human society. The idea of the impact of the physical environment on civilizations was espoused by this [[Annales School]] to describe the long term developments that shape human history&lt;ref name="Worster1988" /&gt; by focusing away from political and intellectual history, toward [[agriculture]], [[demography]], and [[geography]]. [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], a pupil of the Annales School, was the first to really embrace, in the 1950s, environmental history in a more contemporary form.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|McNeill|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential members of the Annales School was [[Lucien Febvre]] (1878–1956), whose book ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' is now a classic in the field.

The most influential empirical and theoretical work in the subject has been done in the United States where teaching programs first emerged and a generation of trained environmental historians is now active.&lt;ref name="Warde 2007"/&gt; In the United States environmental history as an independent field of study emerged in the general cultural reassessment and reform of the 1960s and 1970s along with environmentalism, "conservation history",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/hisnps/NPSThinking/nps-oah.htm Adam Rome "Conservation, Preservation, and Environmental Activism: A Survey  of the Historical Literature"]. Retrieved 2010-8-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and a gathering awareness of the global scale of some environmental issues. This was in large part a reaction to the way nature was represented in history at the time, which “portrayed the advance of culture and technology as releasing humans from dependence on the natural world and providing them with the means to manage it [and] celebrated human mastery over other forms of life and the natural environment, and expected technological improvement and economic growth to accelerate”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental historians intended to develop a post-colonial historiography that was "''more inclusive in its narratives''".&lt;ref name=Worster290 /&gt;

===Moral and political inspiration===
Moral and political inspiration to environmental historians has come from  American writers and activists such as [[Henry David Thoreau|Henry Thoreau]], [[John Muir]], [[Aldo Leopold]], and [[Rachel Carson]]. Environmental history "frequently promoted a moral and political agenda although it steadily became a more scholarly enterprise".&lt;ref name="Worster290"/&gt; Early attempts to define the field were made in the United States by [[Roderick Nash]] in “The State of Environmental History” and in other works by frontier historians [[Frederick Jackson Turner]], [[James Malin]], and [[Walter Prescott Webb]], who analyzed the process of settlement. Their work was expanded by a second generation of more specialized environmental historians such as [[Alfred Crosby]], [[Samuel P. Hays]], [[Donald Worster]], [[William Cronon]], [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], [[Carolyn Merchant]], [[J. R. McNeill]], [[Donald Hughes]], and Chad Montrie in the United States and [[Paul Warde]], [[Sverker Sorlin]], [[Robert A. Lambert]], [[T.C. Smout]], and Peter Coates in Europe.

===British Empire===
Although environmental history was growing rapidly after 1970, it only reached [[Historiography of the British Empire|historians of the British Empire]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Winks, ed.|title=The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume V: Historiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68w-855pL-MC|year=1999|pages=664–65|isbn=9780191647697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madhav  Gadgil and Ramachandra  Guha, ''This fissured land: an ecological history of India'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. MacKenzie, ''The empire of nature: Hunting, conservation and British Imperialism'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Barton argues that the concept of environmentalism emerged from forestry studies, and emphasizes the British imperial role in that research.  He argues that imperial forestry movement in India around 1900 included government reservations, new methods of fire protection, and attention to revenue-producing forest management. The result eased the fight between romantic preservationists and laissez-faire businessmen, thus giving the compromise from which modern environmentalism emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Barton, "Empire forestry and the origins of environmentalism." ''Journal of Historical Geography'' 27#4 (2001): 529-552.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years numerous scholars cited by James Beattie have examined the environmental impact of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;James Beattie, "Recent Themes in the Environmental History of the British Empire," ''History Compass'' (Feb 2012) 10#2 pp 129-139&lt;/ref&gt;   Beinart and Hughes argue that the discovery and commercial or scientific use of new plants was an important concern in the 18th and 19th centuries. The efficient use of rivers through dams and irrigation projects was an expensive but important method of raising agricultural productivity. Searching for more efficient ways of using natural resources, the British moved flora, fauna and commodities around the world, sometimes resulting in ecological disruption and radical environmental change. Imperialism also stimulated more modern attitudes toward nature and subsidized botany and agricultural research.&lt;ref&gt;William Beinart  and Lotte Hughes. ''Environment and empire'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have used the British Empire to examine the utility of the new concept of eco-cultural networks as a lens for examining interconnected, wide-ranging social and environmental processes.&lt;ref&gt;James Beattie, Edward Melillo, and Emily O'Gorman. "Rethinking the British Empire through eco-cultural networks: materialist-cultural environmental history, relational connections and agency." ''Environment and History'' 20#4 (2014): 561-575.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the [[American Society for Environmental History]] was founded in 1975 while the first institute devoted specifically to environmental history in Europe was established in 1991, based at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. In 1986, the Dutch foundation for the history of environment and hygiene ''[[Net Werk]]'' was founded and publishes four newsletters per year. In the UK the [[White Horse Press]] in Cambridge has, since 1995, published the journal ''[[Environment and History]]'' which aims to bring scholars in the humanities and biological sciences closer together in constructing long and well-founded perspectives on present day environmental problems and a similar publication ''[[Tijdschrift voor Ecologische Geschiedenis]]'' (''Journal for Environmental History'') is a combined Flemish-Dutch initiative mainly dealing with topics in the Netherlands and Belgium although it also has an interest in European environmental history. Each issue contains abstracts in English, French and German. In 1999 the Journal was converted into a yearbook for environmental history. In Canada the [[Network in Canadian History and Environment]] facilitates the growth of environmental history through numerous workshops and a significant digital infrastructure including their website and podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NiCHE Website|url=http://niche-canada.org|accessdate=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication between European nations is restricted by language difficulties. In April 1999 a meeting was held in Germany to overcome these problems and to co-ordinate environmental history in Europe. This meeting resulted in the creation of the [[European Society for Environmental History]] in 1999. Only two years after its establishment, ESEH held its first international conference in St. Andrews, Scotland. Around 120 scholars attended the meeting and 105 papers were presented on topics covering the whole spectrum of environmental history. The conference showed that environmental history is a viable and lively field in Europe and since then ESEH has expanded to over 400 members and continues to grow and attracted international conferences in 2003 and 2005. In 1999 the ''Centre for Environmental History'' was established at the University of Stirling. Some history departments at European universities are now offering introductory courses in environmental history and postgraduate courses in Environmental history have been established at the Universities of Nottingham, Stirling and Dundee and more recently a Graduierten Kolleg was created at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eh-resources.org/environmental_history.html What is Environmental History? K. Jan Oosthoek]. Retrieved 2010-8-8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society]] (RCC), an international, interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities and social sciences, was founded as a joint initiative of Munich's [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität]] and the [[Deutsches Museum]], with the generous support of the [[German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCC Website|url=http://www.carsoncenter.uni-muenchen.de/index.html|accessdate=Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environment &amp; Society Portal (environmentandsociety.org) is the Rachel Carson Center's open access digital archive and publication platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment &amp; Society Portal Website|url=http://www.environmentandsociety.org/|accessdate=Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental history prides itself in bridging the gap between the arts and natural sciences although to date the scales weigh on the side of science. A definitive list of related subjects would be lengthy indeed and singling out those for special mention a difficult task. However, those frequently quoted include, [[historical geography]], the [[history and philosophy of science]], [[history of technology]] and [[climate science]]. On the biological side there is, above all, [[ecology]] and [[historical ecology]], but also [[forestry]] and especially [[Forestry#History|forest history]], [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]]. When the subject engages in environmental advocacy it has much in common with [[environmentalism]].

With increasing globalization and the impact of global trade on resource distribution, concern over never-ending economic growth and the many human inequities environmental history is now gaining allies in the fields of  [[ecological economics|ecological]] and [[environmental economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bess|2005|pp=30–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martinez-Alier|Schandle|2002|pp=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engagement with sociological thinkers and the humanities is limited but cannot be ignored through the beliefs and ideas that guide human action. This has been seen as the reason for a perceived lack of support from traditional historians.&lt;ref name="Warde 2007"/&gt;

==Issues==
The subject has a number of areas of lively debate. These include discussion concerning: what subject matter is most appropriate; whether environmental advocacy can detract from scholarly objectivity; standards of professionalism in a subject where much outstanding work has been done by non-historians; the relative contribution of nature and humans in determining the passage of history; the degree of connection with, and acceptance by, other disciplines - but especially mainstream history. For Paul Warde the sheer scale, scope and diffuseness of the environmental history endeavour calls for an analytical toolkit "a range of common issues and questions to push forward collectively" and a "core problem". He sees a lack of "human agency" in its texts and suggest it be written more to act: as a source of information for environmental scientists; incorporation of the notion of risk; a closer analysis of what it is we mean by "environment"; confronting the way environmental history is at odds with the humanities because it emphasises the division between "materialist, and cultural or constructivist explanations for human behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Warde|Sorlin|2007|pp=107–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global sustainability===
[[File:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|thumb|alt=Two views of the Earth from space.|Achieving sustainability will enable the Earth to continue supporting human life as we know it. [[The Blue Marble|Blue Marble]] NASA composite images: 2001 (left), 2002 (right)]]
{{Main|Sustainability}}
Many of the themes of environmental history inevitably examine the circumstances that produced the environmental problems of the present day, a litany of themes that challenge global sustainability including: [[population]], [[consumerism]] and [[materialism]], [[climate change]], [[waste disposal]], [[deforestation]] and loss of wilderness, [[industrial agriculture]], [[species extinction]], depletion of natural resources, [[introduced species|invasive organisms]] and [[urban development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simple message of sustainable use of renewable resources is frequently repeated and early as 1864 [[George Perkins Marsh]] was pointing out that the changes we make in the environment may later reduce the environments usefulness to humans so any changes should be made with great care&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Marsh|1864|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - what we would nowadays call [[enlightened self-interest]]. Richard Grove has pointed out that "''States will act to prevent environmental degradation only when their economic interests are threatened''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grove|1992|pp=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy===
{{Main |Advocacy}}
It is not clear whether environmental history should promote a moral or political agenda. The strong emotions raised by environmentalism, conservation and sustainability can interfere with historical objectivity: polemical tracts and strong advocacy can compromise objectivity and professionalism. Engagement with the political process certainly has its academic perils&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1983|pp=8–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although accuracy and commitment to the historical method is not necessarily threatened by environmental involvement: environmental historians have a reasonable expectation that their work will inform policy-makers.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Worster|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent historiographical shift has placed an increased emphasis on inequality as an element of environmental history. Imbalances of power in resources, industry, and politics have resulted in the burden of industrial pollution being shifted to less powerful populations in both the geographic and social spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurley |first1=Andrew |title=Environmental Inequalities:Class, Race, and Industrial Pollution in Gary, Indiana, 1945-1980 |date=1995 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill, NC |isbn=0807845183}}&lt;/ref&gt; An critical examination of the traditional environmentalist movement from this historical perspective notes the ways in which early advocates of environmentalism sought the aesthetic preservation of middle-class spaces and sheltered their own communities from the worst effects of air and water pollution, while neglecting the plight of the less privileged. 

Communities with less economic and sociopolitical power often lack the resources to get involved in environmental advocacy. Environmental history increasingly highlights the ways in which the middle-class environmental movement has fallen short and left behind entire communities. Interdisciplinary research now understands historic inequality as a lens through which to predict future social developments in the environmental sphere, particularly with regard to [[climate change]]. The [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] cautions that a warming planet will exacerbate environmental and other inequalities, particularly with regard to: "(a) increase in the exposure of the disadvantaged groups to the adverse effects of climate change; (b) increase in their susceptibility to damage caused by climate change; and (c) decrease in their ability to cope and recover from the damage suffered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Islam |first1=S. Nazrul |title=Climate Change and Social Inequality |url=http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2017/wp152_2017.pdf |website=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an interdisciplinary field that encompasses a new understanding of social justice dynamics in a rapidly changing global climate, environmental history is inherently advocative.

===Declensionist narratives===
Narratives of environmental history tend to be declensionist, that is, accounts of progressive decline under human activity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Presentism and culpability===
{{Main| Presentism (literary and historical analysis)}}
Under the accusation of "presentism" it is sometimes claimed that, with its genesis in the late 20th century environmentalism and conservation issues, environmental history is simply a reaction to contemporary problems, an "attempt to read late twentieth century developments and concerns back into past historical periods in which they were not operative, and certainly not conscious to human participants during those times".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is strongly related to the idea of culpability. In environmental debate blame can always be apportioned, but it is more constructive for the future to understand the values and imperatives of the period under discussion so that causes are determined and the context explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dovers|1994|pp=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental determinism===
{{further|Environmental determinism|Cultural determinism}}
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|left|Ploughing farmer in ancient Egypt. [[Mural]] in the burial chamber of [[artisan]] [[Sennedjem]] c. 1200 BCE]]
For some environmental historians "the general conditions of the environment, the scale and arrangement of land and sea, the availability of resources, and the presence or absence of animals available for domestication, and associated organisms and disease vectors, that makes the development of human cultures possible and even predispose the direction of their development"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "history is inevitably guided by forces that are not of human origin or subject to human choice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been attributed to American environmental historians Webb and Turner&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|White|2001|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently to [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', where the presence or absence of disease vectors and resources such as plants and animals that are amenable to domestication that may not only stimulate the development of human culture but even determine, to some extent, the direction of that development. The claim that the path of history has been forged by environmental rather than cultural forces is referred to as [[environmental determinism]] while, at the other extreme, is what may be called [[cultural determinism]]. An example of cultural determinism would be the view that human influence is so pervasive that the idea of pristine nature has little validity - that there is no way of relating to nature without culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|See Cronon|1995|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
{{Main|Historical method}}
[[File:HistoricalMarkerUSGeorgiaPioneerTurpentiningExperiment.jpg|thumb|Recording historical events]]
Useful guidance on the process of doing environmental history has been given by Donald Worster,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|pp=289–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn Merchant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|See Merchant|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Cronon&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronon|1993|pp=1347–1376}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ian Simmons (geographer)|Ian Simmons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|See Simmons|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worster's three core subject areas (the environment itself, human impacts on the environment, and human thought about the environment) are generally taken as a starting point for the student as they encompass many of the different skills required. The tools are those of both history and science with a requirement for fluency in the language of natural science and especially ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2008|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact methodologies and insights from a range of physical and social sciences is required, there seeming to be universal agreement that environmental history is indeed a multidisciplinary subject.

==Future==
[[File:Eolienne et centrale thermique Nuon Sloterdijk.jpg|thumb|Old and new human uses of the atmosphere]]

Environmental history, like all historical studies, shares the hope that through an examination of past events it may be possible to forge a more considered future. In particular a greater depth of historical knowledge can inform environmental controversies and guide policy decisions.

The subject continues to provide new perspectives, offering cooperation between scholars with different disciplinary backgrounds and providing an improved historical context to resource and environmental problems. There seems little doubt that, with increasing concern for our environmental future, environmental history will continue along the path of environmental advocacy from which it originated as “''human impact on the living systems of the planet bring us no closer to utopia, but instead to a crisis of survival''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; with key themes being population growth, climate change, conflict over environmental policy at different levels of human organization, extinction, biological invasions, the environmental consequences of technology especially biotechnology, the reduced supply of resources - most notably energy, materials and water. Hughes comments that environmental historians “''will find themselves increasingly challenged by the need to explain the background of the world market economy and its effects on the global environment. Supranational instrumentalities threaten to overpower conservation in a drive for what is called sustainable development, but which in fact envisions no limits to economic growth''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes also notes that "''environmental history is notably absent from nations that most adamantly reject US, or Western influences''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Bess sees the world increasingly permeated by potent technologies in a process he calls “artificialization” which has been accelerating since the 1700s, but at a greatly accelerated rate after 1945. Over the next fifty years, this transformative process stands a good chance of turning our physical world, and our society, upside-down. Environmental historians can “''play a vital role in helping humankind to understand the gale-force of artifice that we have unleashed on our planet and on ourselves''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bess|2005b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this background “''environmental history can give an essential perspective, offering knowledge of the historical process that led to the present situation, give examples of past problems and solutions, and an analysis of the historical forces that must be dealt with''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, as expressed by William Cronon, "''The viability and success of new human modes of existing within the constraints of the environment and its resources requires both an understanding of the past and an articulation of a new ethic for the future''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5474508 |title=See Cronon quote here |publisher=Searchworks.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2677">'''ExPASy''' is a [[bioinformatics]] resource portal operated by the SIB [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]] and in particular the SIB Web Team. It is an extensible and integrative portal accessing many scientific resources, databases and software tools in different areas of life sciences. Scientists can access a wide range of resources in many different domains, such as [[proteomics]], [[genomics]], [[phylogenetics]]/[[evolution]], [[systems biology]], [[population genetics]], and [[transcriptomics]]. The individual resources (databases, web-based and downloadable software tools) are hosted in a decentralised way by different groups of the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and partner institutions. Specifically, a single web portal provides a common entry point to a wide range of resources developed and operated by many different SIB groups and external institutions. The portal features a search function across selected resources. Internally, the availability and usage of resources are monitored. The portal is aimed for both expert users and for people who are not familiar with a specific domain in life sciences: in particular, the new web interface provides visual guidance for newcomers to ExPASy.

== History ==

Originally, ExPASy was called '''ExPASy''' ('''Ex'''pert '''P'''rotein '''A'''nalysis '''Sy'''stem) and acted  as a [[proteomics]] server to analyze [[protein]] sequences and structures and [[two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] (2-D Page electrophoresis).&lt;ref name="pmid12824418"&gt;{{cite journal |pages=3784–8 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkg563 |title=ExPASy: The proteomics server for in-depth protein knowledge and analysis |year=2003 |last1=Gasteiger |first1=E. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=31 |issue=13 |pmid=12824418 |last2=Gattiker |first2=A |last3=Hoogland |first3=C |last4=Ivanyi |first4=I |last5=Appel |first5=RD |last6=Bairoch |first6=A |pmc=168970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, ExPASy hosted the protein sequence knowledgebase, UniProtKB/[[Swiss-Prot]], and its computer annotated supplement, UniProtKB/TrEMBL, before these moved to the [[UniProt]] website.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

ExPASy was the [[List of websites founded before 1995|first website]] of the [[life sciences]].

{{As of|2007|4|5}}, ExPASy had been consulted 1 billion times since its installation on 1 August 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expasy.org/ ExPASy: SIB Bioinformatics Resource Portal]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explorer 29''' (also called '''GEOS 1''' or '''GEOS A''', acronym to '''Geodetic Earth Orbiting Satellite''') was an American [[satellite]] launched as part of the [[Explorers program]], being the first of the two satellites '''GEOS'''. Explorer 29 was launched on 6 November 1965 from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], with [[Delta rocket]].

Explorer 29 was a gravity-[[gradient]]-stabilized, [[solar cell]] powered unit designed exclusively for [[geodetic effect|geodetic]] studies. It was the first successful active spacecraft of the ''National Geodetic Satellite Program''. Instrumentation included:

* Optical Beacon System
* [[Laser]] Tracking Reflector
* Radio [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] System
* SECOR Range [[Transponder]]
* Radio Range/Rate System

These were designed to operate simultaneously to fulfill the objectives of locating observation points (geodetic control stations) in a 3 dimensional earth center-of-mass coordinate system within {{convert|10|m|ft}} of accuracy, of defining the structure of the earth's irregular [[gravitational field]] and refining the locations and magnitudes of the large gravity anomalies, and of comparing results of the various systems onboard the spacecraft to determine the most accurate and reliable system. Acquisition and recording of data were the responsibility of the [[Goddard Space Flight Center|GSFC]] ''Space Tracking and Data Acquisitions Network'' (STADAN). Ten major observing networks were used.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7248">The '''fitness-density covariance''' is a [[coexistence theory|coexistence mechanism]] that can allow similar species to coexist because they are in different locations.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|title=General Theory of Competitive Coexistence in Spatially-Varying Environments|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=November 2000|volume=58|issue=3|pages=211–237|doi=10.1006/tpbi.2000.1486|pmid=11120650}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This effect will be the strongest if species are completely segregated, but can also work if their populations overlap somewhat.  If a fitness-density covariance is operating, then when a species becomes very rare, its population will shift to predominantly locations with favorable conditions (e.g., less competition or good [[habitat]]). Similarly, when a species becomes very common, then conditions will worsen where they are most common, and they will spread into areas where conditions are less favorable.  This negative feedback can help species avoid being driven extinct by competition, and it can prevent stronger species from becoming too common and crowding out other species.

Along with [[storage effect]]s and [[relative nonlinearity|relative nonlinearities]], fitness-density covariances make up the three variation-dependent mechanisms of [[coexistence theory|modern coexistence theory]].&lt;ref name="Chesson2000review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|title=Mechanisms of Maintenance of Species Diversity|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|date=November 2000|volume=31|issue=1|pages=343–366|doi=10.1146/Annurev.Ecolsys.31.1.343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical derivation==
Here, we will consider competition between ''n'' species.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;  We will define ''N''&lt;sub&gt;xj&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') as the number of individuals of species ''j'' at patch ''x'' and time ''t'', and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') the fitness (i.e., the per-capita contribution of individual to the next time period through survival and reproduction) of individuals of species ''j''s at patch ''x'' and time ''t''.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;  ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(t) will be determined by many things, including [[habitat]], [[intraspecific competition]], and [[interspecific competition]] at ''x''.  Thus, if there are currently ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') individuals at ''x'', then they will contribute ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''(''t'')&lt;/sub&gt;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') individuals to the next time period (i.e., ''t''+1).  Those individuals may stay at ''x'', or they may move; the net contribution of ''x'' to next year's population will be the same.

With our definitions in place, we want to calculate the finite rate of increase of species ''j'' (i.e., its population-wide growth rate), &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  It is defined such that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t) = \overline{N_j(t+1)}/ \overline{N_j(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where each average is across all space.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;  In essence, it is the average fitness of members of species ''j'' in year ''t''.  We can calculate ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''+1) by summing ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''(''t'')&lt;/sub&gt;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') across all patches, giving
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{\lambda}(t) = \frac{1}{X}\sum_X \frac{N_{xj}(t)\lambda_{xj}(t)}{\overline{N_j(t)}} , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''X'' is the number of patches.  Defining &lt;math&gt;\nu_{xj} = N_{xj}(t)/\overline{N_j(t)}&lt;/math&gt; as species ''j'''s relative density at ''x'', this equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t) = \frac{1}{X}\sum_X \nu_{xj}\lambda_{xj}(t) = \overline{\nu_{xj}\lambda_{xj}(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the theorem that &lt;math&gt;\overline{XY} = \overline{X}~\overline{Y} + \mbox{cov}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;, this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{\lambda_j}(t) = \overline{\nu_{xj}}\overline{\lambda_{xj}(t)}+ \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xj}, \lambda_{xj}(t)).&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\nu_{xj} = N_{xj}(t)/\overline{N_{xj}(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, its average will be 1.  Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t) = \overline{\lambda_{xj}(t)}+ \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xj}, \lambda_{xj}(t)).&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, we have partitioned &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t)&lt;/math&gt; into two key parts: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\lambda_{xj}(t)}&lt;/math&gt; calculates the fitness of an individual, on average in any given site.  Thus, if species are distributed uniformly across the landscape, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t)=\overline{\lambda_{xj}(t)}&lt;/math&gt;. If, however, they are distributed non-randomly across the environment, then cov(''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;xj&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) will be non-zero.  If individuals are found predominantly in good sites, then cov(''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;xj&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) will be positive; if they are found predominantly in poor sites, then cov(''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;xj&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) will be negative.

To analyze how species coexist, we perform an [[invasion analysis]].&lt;ref name="Chesson2000review" /&gt;  In short, we remove one species (called the "invader") from the environment, and allow the other species (called the "residents") to come the equilibrium (so that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_r}(t) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for each resident).  We then determine if the invader has a positive growth rate.  If each species has a positive growth rate as an invader, then they can coexist.

Because &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_r}(t) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for each resident, we can calculate the invader's growth rate, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_i}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, as
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_i}(t) = \tilde{\lambda_i}(t) - \frac{1}{n-1} \sum (\tilde{\lambda_r}(t) - 1),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n''-1 is the number of residents (since ''n'' is the number of species), and the sum is over all residents (and thus represents an average).&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;  Using our formula for &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we find that
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_i}(t) = [\overline{\lambda_{xi}(t)}+ \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xi}, \lambda_{xi}(t)) ] - \frac{1}{n-1} \sum [\overline{\lambda_{xr}(t)}+ \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xr}, \lambda_{xr}(t))- 1].&lt;/math&gt;
This rearranges to
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_i}(t) =1+ \left[ \overline{\lambda_{xi}(t)} -\frac{1}{n-1} \sum \overline{\lambda_{xr}(t)} \right]+ \Delta \kappa .&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \kappa = \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xi}, \lambda_{xi}(t)) - \frac{1}{n-1} \sum \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xr}, \lambda_{xr}(t))&lt;/math&gt;
is the fitness-density covariance, and &lt;math&gt;\left[ \overline{\lambda_{xi}(t)} -\frac{1}{n-1} \sum \overline{\lambda_{xr}(t)} \right] &lt;/math&gt; contains all other mechanisms (such as the [[storage effect|spatial storage effect]]).&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;

Thus, if Δ''κ'' is positive, then the invader's population is more able to build up its population in good areas (i.e., ''ν&lt;sub&gt;xi&lt;/sub&gt;'' is higher where ''λ&lt;sub&gt;xi&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'') is large), compared to the residents.  This can occur if the invader builds up in good areas (i.e., cov(''ν&lt;sub&gt;xi&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''λ&lt;sub&gt;xi&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')) is very positive) or if the residents are forced into poor areas (i.e., cov(''ν&lt;sub&gt;xr&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''λ&lt;sub&gt;xr&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')) is less positive, or negative).  In either case, species gain an advantage when they are invaders, a key point of any [[coexistence theory#Stabilizing mechanisms|stabilizing mechanism]].

Various [[scientist]]s and [[engineer]]s contributed to the development of [[internal combustion engine]]s. In 1791, [[John Barber (engineer)|John Barber]] developed a [[turbine]]. In 1794 Thomas Mead patented a gas engine. Also in 1794 Robert Street patented an internal combustion engine, which was also the first to use the liquid fuel (gasoline), and built an engine around that time. In 1798, [[John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)|John Stevens]] designed the first American internal combustion engine. In 1807, [[France|French]] engineers [[Nicéphore Niépce|Nicéphore]] (who went on to invent [[photography]]) and [[Claude Niépce]] ran  a prototype internal combustion engine, using controlled dust explosions, the [[Pyréolophore]]. This engine powered a boat on the [[Saône]] river, France. The same year,  the  [[Swiss]] engineer [[François Isaac de Rivaz]] built an internal combustion engine ignited by electric spark. In 1823, [[Samuel Brown (engineer)|Samuel Brown]] patented the first internal combustion engine to be applied industrially, one of his engines pumped water on the [[Croydon Canal]] from 1830 to 1836. He also demonstrated a boat using his engine on the Thames in 1827, and an engine driven carriage in 1828.

Father [[Eugenio Barsanti]], an Italian engineer, together with [[Felice Matteucci]] of Florence invented the first real internal combustion engine in 1853. Their patent request was granted in London on June 12, 1854, and published in London's Morning Journal under the title "Specification of Eugene Barsanti and Felix Matteucci, Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gasses". In 1860, [[Belgian]] [[Etienne Lenoir|Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir]] produced a gas-fired internal combustion engine. In 1864, [[Nikolaus Otto]] patented the first atmospheric gas engine. In 1872, American [[George Brayton]] invented the first commercial liquid-fueled internal combustion engine. In 1876, [[Nikolaus Otto]], working with [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]], patented the compressed charge, four-cycle engine. In 1879, [[Karl Benz]] patented a reliable [[two-stroke]] gas engine. In 1892, [[Rudolf Diesel]] developed the first compressed charge, compression ignition engine. In 1926, [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]] launched the first liquid-fueled rocket. In 1939, the [[Heinkel He 178]] became the world's first [[jet aircraft]].  In 1954 German engineer [[Felix Wankel]] patented a "pistonless" engine using an eccentric rotary design.

==1860–1910==
[[File:Enginy Otto-langen 1867.jpg|thumb|right|Patent of Otto-Langen engine 1863]]
[[File:Two-stroke vee-twin engine with pumping cylinders (section).jpg|thumb|Sir Dugald Clerk's two cycle engine from 1879]]
[[File:Benz Patent Motorwagen Engine.jpg|thumb|This internal combustion engine was an integral aspect of the patent for the first patented automobile, made by Karl Benz on January 29, 1886.]] 
[[File:CarlBenz.jpg|thumb|Karl Benz]]
*1860: [[Belgian]] [[Etienne Lenoir|Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir]] (1822–1900) produced a gas-fired internal combustion engine similar in appearance to a horizontal double-acting [[steam]] engine, with [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s, [[piston]]s, [[connecting rod]]s, and [[flywheel]] in which the gas essentially took the place of the steam. This was the first internal combustion engine to be produced in numbers.
*1861: Nikolaus Otto builds a copy of the Lenoir engine.
*1862: Nikolaus Otto attempts the construction of the compressed charge four cycle engine, and fails.
*1862: The earliest confirmed patent of the 4-cycle engine, by [[Alphonse Beau de Rochas]].  This was principle only, there was NO engine built to prove the concept.
*1862: The German [[Nikolaus Otto]] begins to manufacture a no compression gas Lenoir engine with a free piston.&lt;ref&gt;Machines: A Pictorial History; Sigvard Strandh. {{ISBN|84-86115-20-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1864: [[Nikolaus Otto]], patented in England and other countries his first atmospheric gas engine. Otto was the first to build and sell this type of compressionless  engine designed with an indirect-acting free-piston, whose great efficiency won the support of [[Eugen Langen]] and then most of the market, which at that time was mainly for small stationary engines fueled by lighting gas.  [[Eugen Langen]] collaborated with Otto in the design and they began to manufacture it in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/~johnd/ICEngines/HISTORY%20OF%20THE%20OTTO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*1865: [[Pierre Hugon]] started production of the Hugon engine, similar to the Lenoir engine, but with better economy, and more reliable flame ignition.
*1867: Otto and Langen exhibited their free piston engine at the Paris Exhibition in 1867, and they won the greatest award. It had less than half the gas consumption of the Lenoir or Hugon engines.
*1870: In Vienna, [[Siegfried Marcus]] put the first mobile gasoline and the first modern [[internal combustion engine]] on a handcart.
*1872: In America [[George Brayton]] invented Brayton's Ready Motor and went into commercial production, this used constant pressure combustion, and was the first commercial liquid fuelled internal combustion engine.
*1876: [[Nikolaus Otto]], working with [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]], patented the compressed charge, four-stroke engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Zeleznik, F. J. |author2=Mcbride, B. J. |title=Modeling the Internal Combustion Engine|journal=NASA Reference Publication|hdl=2060/19850011423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Germany|German]] courts, however, did not hold his patent to cover all in-cylinder compression engines or even the four-stroke cycle, and after this decision, in-cylinder compression became universal.
*1878: [[Dugald Clerk]] designed the first two-stroke engine with in-cylinder compression.  He patented it in England in 1881.
*1879: [[Karl Benz]], working independently, was granted a [[patent]] for his reliable [[two-stroke]], internal combustion engine, gas engine.
*1882: [[James Atkinson (inventor)|James Atkinson]] invented the [[Atkinson cycle]] engine. Atkinson's engine had one power phase per revolution together with different intake and expansion volumes, potentially making it more efficient than the Otto cycle, but certainly avoiding Otto's patent.
*1884: British engineer [[Edward Butler (inventor)|Edward Butler]] constructed the first petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine. Butler invented the [[spark plug]], [[ignition magneto]], [[Ignition system|coil ignition]] and spray jet [[carburetor]], and was the first to use the word [[petrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bexley.gov.uk/article/10664/Hiram-Maxim-and-Edward-Butler|title=Hiram Maxim and Edward Butler:Two local inventors|website=Bexley|publisher=Bexley|accessdate=11 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215204601/http://www.bexley.gov.uk/article/10664/Hiram-Maxim-and-Edward-Butler|archivedate=15 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1885: [[Germany|German]] engineer [[Gottlieb Daimler]] received a German patent for a [[supercharger]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superchargerkits.org/people/gottlieb-daimler/|title=Gottlieb Daimler}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1885/1886 Karl Benz designed and built his own [[four-stroke]] engine that was used in his [[automobile]], which was developed in 1885, patented in 1886, and became the first automobile in series production.
*1887: [[Gustaf de Laval]] introduces the [[de Laval nozzle]]
*1889: Félix Millet begins development of [[Millet motorcycle|the first vehicle]] to be powered by a [[rotary engine]] in transportation history. 
*1891: [[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]] built his oil engine, leasing rights to [[Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons|Hornsby]] of England to build them. They built the first cold-start compression-ignition engines. In 1892, they installed the first ones in a water pumping station. In the same year, an experimental higher-pressure version produced self-sustaining ignition through compression alone.
*1892: [[Rudolf Diesel]] developed the first compressed charge, compression ignition engine .&lt;ref&gt;DE patent 67207 Rudolf Diesel: "Arbeitsverfahren und Ausführungsart für Verbrennungskraftmaschinen" pg 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1893 February 23: [[Rudolf Diesel]] received a patent for his [[diesel engine|compression ignition (diesel) engine]].
*1896: [[Karl Benz]] invented the [[boxer engine]], also known as the horizontally opposed [[engine]], or the flat engine, in which the corresponding [[piston]]s reach top dead center at the same time, thus balancing each other in momentum.
*1897: [[Robert Bosch]] was the first to adapt a magneto ignition to a vehicle engine.
*1898: Fay Oliver Farwell designs the prototype of the line of [[Adams-Farwell]] automobiles, all to be powered with three or five cylinder rotary internal combustion engines.
*1900: [[Rudolf Diesel]] demonstrated the diesel engine in the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''Exposition Universelle'']] ([[World's Fair]]) using peanut oil fuel (see [[biodiesel]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dieselduck.ca/library/01%20articles/rudolph_diesel.htm Martin Leduc, "Biography of Rudolph Diesel"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611043607/http://www.dieselduck.ca/library/01%20articles/rudolph_diesel.htm |date=2010-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1900: [[Wilhelm Maybach]] designed an engine built at [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]]&amp;mdash;following the specifications of [[Emil Jellinek]]&amp;mdash;who required the engine to be named ''Daimler-Mercedes'' after his daughter. In 1902 automobiles with that engine were put into production by DMG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/344/000174819/|title=Wilhelm Maybach|website=www.nndb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emercedesbenz.com/Apr08/17_001109_The_History_Behind_The_Mercedes_Benz_Brand_And_The_Three_Pointed_Star.html The history behind the Mercedes-Benz brand and the three-pointed star]. eMercedesBenz.com. April 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1903: [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] begins a series of theoretical papers discussing the use of [[rocket]]ry to reach outer space. A major point in his work is [[liquid fuel]]ed rockets.
* 1903: [[Ægidius Elling]] builds a gas turbine using a [[centrifugal compressor]] which runs under its own power.  By most definitions, this is the first working gas turbine.
* 1905: Alfred Buchi patents the [[turbocharger]] and starts producing the first examples.
* 1903–1906: The team of Armengaud and Lemale in [[France]] build a complete gas turbine engine. It uses three separate compressors driven by a single turbine. Limits on the turbine temperatures allow for only a 3:1 [[compression ratio]], and the turbine is not based on a Parsons-like "fan", but a [[Pelton wheel]]-like arrangement. The engine is so inefficient, at about 3% [[thermal efficiency]], that the work is abandoned.
* 1908: [[New Zealand]] [[inventor]] [[Ernest Godward]] started a motorcycle business in [[Invercargill]] and fitted the imported bikes with his own invention–a petrol [[economiser]]. His economisers worked as well in cars as they did in motorcycles.
* 1908: [[Hans Holzwarth]] starts work on extensive research on an "explosive cycle" gas turbine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deutsches-museum.de/en/collections/machines/power-engines/gas-turbines/holzwarth-gas-turbine-1908/|title=Deutsches Museum: Holzwarth Gas Turbine, 1908|first=Deutsches|last=Museum|website=www.deutsches-museum.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the [[Otto cycle]]. This design burns fuel at a constant volume and is somewhat more efficient.  By 1927, when the work ended, he has reached about 13% thermal efficiency.
* 1908: [[René Lorin]] patents a design for the [[ramjet]] engine.
* 1916: [[Auguste Rateau]] suggests using exhaust-powered compressors to improve high-altitude performance, the first example of the [[turbocharger]].

==1920–1980==
* 1920: [[William Joseph Stern]] reports to the [[Royal Air Force]] that there is no future for the turbine engine in aircraft. He bases his argument on the extremely low efficiency of existing compressor designs.  Due to Stern's eminence, his paper is so convincing there is little official interest in gas turbine engines anywhere, although this does not last long.
* 1921: [[Maxime Guillaume]] patents the [[axial-flow]] gas turbine engine. It uses multiple stages in both the compressor and turbine, combined with a single very large [[combustion chamber]].
* 1923: [[Edgar Buckingham]] at the [[United States]] [[National Bureau of Standards]] publishes a report on jets, coming to the same conclusion as [[W.J.

* 1951: Engineers for The Texas Company—i.e. now Chevron—developed a four stroke engine with a fuel injector that employed what was called the Texaco Combustion Process, which unlike normal four stroke gasoline engines which used a separate valve for the intake of the air-gasoline mixture, with the T.C.P. engine the intake valve with a built in special shroud delivers the air to the cylinder in a tornado type fashion and then the fuel is injected and ignited by a spark plug.  The inventors  claimed their engine could burn on almost any petroleum based fuel of any octane and even some alcohol based fuels—e.g. kerosene, benzine, motor oil, tractor oil, etc.—without the pre-combustion knock and the complete burning of the fuel injected into the cylinder. While development was well advanced by 1950, there are no records of the T.C.P. engine being used commercially.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mdgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BAjZT-rpNYOe8gTth_jqAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Mechanics%20Science%20installing%20linoleum&amp;f=true "Engine With A Built In Tornado."] ''Popular Mechanic'', September 1950, pp. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engine starting==
{{Main article|Starter motor}}
Early internal combustion engines were started by hand cranking.  Various types of starter motor were later developed.  These included:

* An auxiliary petrol engine for starting a larger petrol or diesel engine. The [[Hucks starter]] is an example
* Cartridge starters, such as the [[Coffman engine starter]], which used a device like a blank [[shotgun]] cartridge. These were popular for [[aircraft engine]]s
* [[Air start system|Pneumatic starters]]
* Hydraulic starters
* [[Starter (engine)|Electric starters]]

Electric starters are now almost universal for small and medium-sized engines, while pneumatic starters are used for large engines.

==Modern vs. historical piston engines==
The first piston engines did not have compression, but ran on an air-fuel mixture sucked or blown in during the first part of the intake stroke. The most significant distinction between '''modern internal combustion engines''' and the early designs is the use of [[compression (physical)|compression]] of the fuel charge prior to combustion.

The problem of ignition of fuel was handled in early engines with an open flame and a sliding gate.  To obtain a faster engine speed Daimler adopted a Hot Tube ignition which allowed 600&amp;nbsp;rpm immediately in his 1883 horizontal cylinder engine and very soon after over 900&amp;nbsp;rpm.  Most of the engines of that time could not exceed 200&amp;nbsp;rpm due to their ignition and induction systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/forum/threads/1883-high-speed-engine-with-hot-tube-ignition.19553/|title=1883: High-speed engine with hot-tube ignition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first practical engine, Lenoir's, ran on illuminating gas (coal gas).  It wasn't until 1883, that Daimler created an engine that ran on liquid petroleum, a fuel called Ligroin which has a chemical makeup of Hexane-N.  The fuel is also known as petroleum naptha.

Otto's first engines were push engines which produced a push through the entire stroke (like a Diesel).  Daimler's engines produced a rapid pulse, more suitable for mobile engine use.

For example, if a metal [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] such as [[aluminium chloride|AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] dissolves in an [[aqueous solution]], the metal cation behaves as a [[Lewis acid]] and hydrolyzes the water molecules in the solvent.&lt;ref&gt;Research and Education Association.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4154">'''Induced-self [[antigen]]''' is a marker of abnormal self, which can be recognized upon infected (in particular, virus-infected) and transformed cells. Therefore, the recognition of "induced self" is an important strategy for surveillance of infection or tumor transformation - it results in elimination of the affected cells by activated [[natural killer cell|NK cells]] or other immunological mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;

==Receptors==
Probably the most studied receptor involved in recognition of induced-self antigens is [[NKG2D]]. It is an activating receptor which is expressed on NK cells and subsets of T and NKT cells. NKG2D can bind proteins at the surface of most cells that are not normally expressed, but that are expressed during a stress response of the cells (e.g. induction of the DNA damage pathway). Moreover, other recognition targets exist, for example ligands induced on human macrophages by TLR stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligands that bind to NKG2D receptor can be divided into two families of MHC class I-related proteins: MICs ([[MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A|MICA]], [[MICB]]) and ULBPs (ULBP1, ULBP2, ULBP3, ULBP4, RAET1G, RAET1L).&lt;ref&gt;

Other receptors able to bind induced-self antigens are NKG2C, NKG2E, NKG2F (CD94) or some NCRs (e.g. NKp 46 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Tumor targeting==
Practical use of the knowledge of induced-self antigens is in targeting tumors for immune response. As tumors are very often capable of escaping the immune system by many ways, upregulation of specific ligands on the tumor cells could mount effective immune mechanisms able to eliminate these cells. For example, upregulation of NKG2D ligands can stimulate the NK cells triggering cell-mediated cytotoxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''International Classification of Diseases''' ('''ICD''') is the international "standard [[Diagnosis|diagnostic]] tool for [[epidemiology]], [[health management]] and clinical purposes." Its full official name is '''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/|title=International Classification of Diseases (ICD)|last=|first=|date=|publisher=World Health Organization|deadurl=no|archivedate=12 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212190115/http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICD is maintained by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the [[United Nations System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/about/en/|title = About WHO|accessdate = 14 March 2014|deadurl = no|publisher = World Health Organization|archivedate = 9 February 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140209050225/http://www.who.int/about/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD is originally designed as a [[health care]] classification system, providing a system of diagnostic codes for classifying [[disease]]s, including nuanced classifications of a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease. This system is designed to map health conditions to corresponding generic categories together with specific variations, assigning for these a designated code, up to six characters long. Thus, major categories are designed to include a set of similar diseases. ICD-11 is a major step forward, because it has the necessary terminological and ontological elements for seamless use in digital health.

The ICD is published by the WHO and used worldwide for morbidity and mortality statistics, [[reimbursement]] systems, and automated decision support in health care. This system is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of these statistics. Like the analogous ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (which is limited to psychiatric disorders and almost exclusive to the United States), the ICD is a major project to statistically classify all health disorders, and provide diagnostic assistance. The ICD is a core statistically based classificatory diagnostic system for health care related issues of the [[Medical classification#WHO Family of International Classifications|WHO Family of International Classifications]] (WHO-FIC).&lt;ref name="WHO-FIC"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/classifications/en/|title = The WHO Family of International Classifications|publisher = World Health Organization|accessdate = 14 March 2014|deadurl = no|archivedate = 22 December 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131222042324/http://www.who.int/classifications/en/|undefined = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICD is revised periodically and is currently in its 10th revision. [[ICD-10]], as it is therefore known, is from 1992 and the WHO publishes annual minor updates and triennial major updates. The final draft of the ICD-11 system is expected to be submitted to WHO's World Health Assembly (WHA) for official endorsement in 2019.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en version for preparation] of approval at the WHA was released on 18 June 2018.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information from World Health Organization (WHO): [http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd/icd10updates/en/index.html List of Official ICD-10 Updates].

The ICD is part of a "family" of international classifications (WHOFIC) that complement each other, including also the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF) which focuses on the domains of functioning (disability) associated with health conditions, from both medical and social perspectives, and the  [[International Classification of Health Interventions]] (ICHI) that classifies the whole range of medical, nursing, functioning and public health interventions.

== Historical synopsis ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
In 1860, during the international statistical congress held in London, [[Florence Nightingale]] made a proposal that was to result in the development of the first model of systemic collection of hospital data. In 1893, a French physician, [[Jacques Bertillon]], introduced the ''Bertillon Classification of Causes of Death'' at a congress of the [[International Statistical Institute]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=%28%28subject%3A%22Bertillon%2C%20Jacques%22%20OR%20subject%3A%22Jacques%20Bertillon%22%20OR%20creator%3A%22Bertillon%2C%20Jacques%22%20OR%20creator%3A%22Jacques%20Bertillon%22%20OR%20creator%3A%22Bertillon%2C%20J%2E%22%20OR%20title%3A%22Jacques%20Bertillon%22%20OR%20description%3A%22Bertillon%2C%20Jacques%22%20OR%20description%3A%22Jacques%20Bertillon%22%29%20OR%20%28%221851-1922%22%20AND%20Bertillon%29%29%20AND%20%28-mediatype:software%29 Works of Jacques Bertillon], Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/classifications/icd/en/HistoryOfICD.pdf|title=''History of the development of the ICD''.|website=Who.int|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of countries adopted Bertillon's system, which was based on the principle of distinguishing between general diseases and those localized to a particular organ or anatomical site, as used by the City of Paris for classifying deaths. Subsequent revisions represented a synthesis of English, German, and Swiss classifications, expanding from the original 44 titles to 161 titles. In 1898, the [[American Public Health Association]] (APHA) recommended that the registrars of Canada, Mexico, and the United States also adopt it. The APHA also recommended revising the system every 10 years to ensure the system remained current with medical practice advances. As a result, the first international conference to revise the International Classification of Causes of Death took place in 1900, with revisions occurring every ten years thereafter. At that time, the classification system was contained in one book, which included an Alphabetic Index as well as a Tabular List. The book was small compared with current coding texts.

The revisions that followed contained minor changes, until the sixth revision of the classification system. With the sixth revision, the classification system expanded to two volumes. The sixth revision included morbidity and mortality conditions, and its title was modified to reflect the changes: International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (ICD). Prior to the sixth revision, responsibility for ICD revisions fell to the Mixed Commission, a group composed of representatives from the International Statistical Institute and the Health Organization of the [[League of Nations]]. In 1948, the WHO assumed responsibility for preparing and publishing the revisions to the ICD every ten years. WHO sponsored the seventh and eighth revisions in 1957 and 1968, respectively. It later became clear that the established ten year interval between revisions was too short.

The ICD is currently the most widely used statistical classification system for diseases in the world.&lt;ref&gt;International health statistics using this system are available at the [http://www.who.int/gho/en/ Global Health Observatory] (GHO) and the [http://www.who.int/whosis/en/ WHO Statistical Information System (WHOSIS)].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some countries—including Australia, Canada, and the United States—have developed their own adaptations of ICD, with more [[procedure code]]s for classification of operative or diagnostic procedures.

==Versions of ICD==

===ICD-6===
The ICD-6, published in 1949, was the first to be shaped to become suitable for morbidity reporting. Accordingly, the name changed from International List of Causes of Death to International Statistical Classification of Diseases. The combined code section for injuries and their associated accidents was split into two, a chapter for injuries, and a chapter for their external causes. With use for morbidity there was a need for coding mental conditions, and for the first time a section on mental disorders was added .&lt;ref name=Katsching&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katsching|first=Heinz|title=Are psychiatrists an endangered species?

===ICD-7===
The international Conference for the Seventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases was held in Paris under the auspices of WHO in February 1955. In accordance with a recommendation of the WHO Expert Committee on Health Statistics, this revision was limited to essential changes and amendments of errors and inconsistencies.&lt;ref name="volume2"/&gt;

===ICD-8a===
The 8th Revision Conference convened by WHO met in Geneva, from 6 to 12 July 1965. This revision was more radical than the Seventh but left unchanged the basic structure of the Classification and the general philosophy of classifying diseases, whenever possible, according to their [[etiology]] rather than a particular manifestation.
During the years that the Seventh and Eighth Revisions of the ICD were in force, the use of the ICD for indexing hospital medical records increased rapidly and some countries prepared national adaptations which provided the additional detail needed for this application of the ICD. 
In the USA, a group of consultants was asked to study the 8th revision of ICD (ICD-8a) for its applicability to various users in the United States. This group recommended that further detail be provided for coding hospital and morbidity data. The American Hospital Association's "Advisory Committee to the Central Office on ICDA" developed the needed adaptation proposals, resulting in the publication of the International Classification of Diseases, Adapted (ICDA). In 1968, the United States Public Health Service published the International Classification of Diseases, Adapted, 8th Revision for use in the United States (ICDA-8a). Beginning in 1968, ICDA-8a served as the basis for coding diagnostic data for both official morbidity [and mortality] statistics in the United States.&lt;ref name="volume2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/sci_data/codes/icd9/type_txt/icd9cm.asp|title=International Classification Of Diseases - 9 - CM, (1979)|website=Wonder.cdc.gov|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ICD-9{{Anchor|ICDM 9|ICDM-9}}===

The International Conference for the Ninth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death, convened by WHO, met in Geneva from 30 September to 6 October 1975. In the discussions leading up to the conference, it had originally been intended that there should be little change other than updating of the classification. This was mainly because of the expense of adapting data processing systems each time the classification was revised.

There had been an enormous growth of interest in the ICD and ways had to be found of responding to this, partly by modifying the classification itself and partly by introducing special coding provisions. A number of representations were made by specialist bodies which had become interested in using the ICD for their own statistics. Some subject areas in the classification were regarded as inappropriately arranged and there was considerable pressure for more detail and for adaptation of the classification to make it more relevant for the evaluation of medical care, by classifying conditions to the chapters concerned with the part of the body affected rather than to those dealing with the underlying generalized disease.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

At the other end of the scale, there were representations from countries and areas where a detailed and sophisticated classification was irrelevant, but which nevertheless needed a classification based on the ICD in order to assess their progress in health care and in the control of disease. A field test with a bi-axial classification approach—one axis (criterion) for anatomy, with another for etiology—showed the impracticability of such approach for routine use.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The final proposals presented to and accepted by the Conference in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1361216 | pmid=16178999 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00444.x | volume=40 | title=Measuring diagnoses: ICD code accuracy | year=2005 | journal=Health Serv Res | pages=1620–39 |vauthors=O'Malley KJ, Cook KF, Price MD, Wildes KR, Hurdle JF, Ashton CM }}&lt;/ref&gt; retained the basic structure of the ICD, although with much additional detail at the level of the four digit subcategories, and some optional five digit subdivisions. For the benefit of users not requiring such detail, care was taken to ensure that the categories at the three digit level were appropriate.

For the benefit of users wishing to produce statistics and indexes oriented towards medical care, the 9th Revision included an optional alternative method of classifying diagnostic statements, including information about both an underlying general disease and a manifestation in a particular organ or site. This system became known as the dagger and asterisk system and is retained in the Tenth Revision. A number of other technical innovations were included in the Ninth Revision, aimed at increasing its flexibility for use in a variety of situations.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

It was eventually replaced by ICD-10, the version currently in use by the WHO and most countries. Given the widespread expansion in the tenth revision, it is not possible to convert ICD-9 data sets directly into ICD-10 data sets, although some tools are available to help guide users.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/classifications/help/icdfaq/en/ FAQ on ICD.] Accessed 12 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
Publication of ICD-9 without IP restrictions in a world with evolving electronic data systems led to a range of products based on ICD-9, such as MeDRA or the Read directory.&lt;ref name="volume2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt;

'''ICPM'''

When ICD-9 was published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) was also developed (1975) and published (1978). The ICPM surgical procedures fascicle was originally created by the United States, based on its adaptations of ICD (called ICDA), which had contained a procedure classification since 1962. ICPM is published separately from the ICD disease classification as a series of supplementary documents called fascicles (bundles or groups of items). Each fascicle contains a classification of modes of laboratory, radiology, surgery, therapy, and other diagnostic procedures. Many countries have adapted and translated the ICPM in parts or as a whole and are using it with amendments since then.&lt;ref name="volume2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt;

'''ICD-9-CM'''

''International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification'' (ICD-9-CM) is an adaption created by the U.S. [[National Center for Health Statistics]] (NCHS) and used in assigning diagnostic and [[procedure code]]s associated with inpatient, outpatient, and physician office utilization in the United States. The ICD-9-CM is based on the ICD-9 but provides for additional [[morbidity]] detail. It is updated annually on October 1.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Center for Health Statistics]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]].

It consists of two or three volumes: 
* [[List of ICD-9 codes|Volumes 1 and 2]] contain [[diagnosis code]]s. (Volume 1 is a tabular listing, and volume 2 is an index.) Extended for ICD-9-CM
* [[ICD-9-CM Volume 3|Volume 3]] contains [[procedure code]]s for surgical, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ICD-9-CM Diagnosis Codes - International Classisfication of Diseases - Medical Diagnosis Codes|url = http://www.findacode.com/icd-9/icd-9-cm-code-set.html|website = www.findacode.com|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICD-9-CM only

The NCHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are the U.S. governmental agencies responsible for overseeing all changes and modifications to the ICD-9-CM.

===ICD-10===
{{main|ICD-10}}

Work on ICD-10 began in 1983, and the new revision was endorsed by the Forty-third [[World Health Assembly]] in May 1990. The latest version came into use in WHO Member States starting in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/ ''International Classification of Diseases (ICD)''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The classification system allows more than 155,000 different codes and permits tracking of many new [[Medical diagnosis|diagnoses]] and [[Medical procedure|procedures]], a significant expansion on the 17,000 codes available in [[ICD-9]].&lt;ref Name="CMS_PressAug2008" /&gt;
Adoption was relatively swift in most of the world. Several materials are made available online by WHO to facilitate its use, including a manual, training guidelines, a browser, and files for download.&lt;ref name="WHO-FIC"/&gt; Some countries have adapted the international standard, such as the "ICD-10-AM" published in Australia in 1998 (also used in New Zealand),&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Health Information Service. [http://www.nzhis.govt.nz/moh.nsf/pagesns/534 ''ICD-10-AM''.] Accessed 12 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "ICD-10-CA" introduced in Canada in 2000.&lt;ref name="CIHI"&gt;Canadian Institute for Health Information.

'''ICD-10-CM'''{{main|ICD-10-CM}}

Adoption of ICD-10-CM was slow in the United States.  Since 1979, the US had required ICD-9-CM codes&lt;ref&gt;[http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/sci_data/codes/icd9/type_txt/icd9cm.asp International Classification Of Diseases - 9 - CM, (1979)].  Wonder.cdc.gov.  Retrieved on 2014-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] claims, and most of the rest of the American medical industry followed suit.  On 1 January 1999 the ICD-10 (without clinical extensions) was adopted for reporting mortality, but ICD-9-CM was still used for [[morbidity]].  Meanwhile, NCHS received permission from the WHO to create a clinical modification of the ICD-10, and has production of all these systems:

* [[ICD-10-CM]], for [[diagnosis code]]s, replaces volumes 1 and 2. Annual updates are provided.
* [[ICD-10-PCS]], for [[procedure codes]], replaces volume 3. Annual updates are provided.

On 21 August 2008, the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) proposed new code sets to be used for reporting diagnoses and procedures on health care transactions. Under the proposal, the ICD-9-CM code sets would be replaced with the ICD-10-CM code sets, effective 1 October 2013. On 17 April 2012 the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a proposed rule that would delay, from 1 October 2013 to 1 October 2014, the compliance date for the ICD-10-CM and PCS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/otheract/icd9/abticd10.htm |title=Classification of Diseases, Functioning, and Disability |publisher=[[U.S. Centers for Disease Control]] |accessdate=29 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, Congress delayed implementation date to 1 October 2015, after it was inserted into "Doc Fix" Bill without debate over objections of many.

Revisions to ICD-10-CM Include:
* Relevant information for ambulatory and managed care encounter.
* Expanded injury codes.
* New combination codes for diagnosis/symptoms to reduce the number of codes needed to describe a problem fully.
* Addition of sixth and seventh digit classification.
* Classification specific to laterality.
* Classification refinement for increased data granularity.
'''ICD-10-CA'''

ICD-10-CA is a clinical modification of ICD-10 developed by the [[Canadian Institute for Health Information]] for morbidity classification in Canada. ICD-10-CA applies beyond acute hospital care, and includes conditions and situations that are not diseases but represent [[risk factor]]s to health, such as occupational and environmental factors, lifestyle and psycho-social circumstances.&lt;ref name="CIHI"/&gt;

=== ICD-11 (stable version for implementation release June 2018) ===
{{External links|section|date=August 2018}}
[[File:ICD-11 Beta browser icon.png|frameless|right]]
The World Health Organization has revised the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) towards the ICD-11.  Its development has taken place on an internet-based workspace that continues to be used as the maintenance platform for discussions, and proposals for updates of ICD. Anybody can submit an evidence based proposal. The proposals are processed in an open transparent way with reviews for scientific evidence, and usability and utility in the various uses of ICD.
It is envisaged, that there will be no need for national modifications of ICD-11, due to its richness and flexibility in the reportable detail 

The final draft of the ICD-11 system is expected to be submitted to WHO's [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) for official endorsement in 2019.&lt;ref name="response"&gt;[http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/revision/icdprojectplan2015to2018.pdf ICD-11 project plan] WHO team for classifications, terminologies and standards/IER  (12 May 2015) Retrieved on 2018-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en version for implementation] (preparation of approval at the WHA) was released on 18 June 2018.&lt;ref name=response/&gt;

ICD-11 comes with an implementation package that includes transition tables from and to ICD-10, a translation tool, a coding tool, web-services, a manual, training material, and more. All tools are accessible after self-registration from the [https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en maintenance platform].&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB143/B143_13-en.pdf ICD update on the eleventh revision - Report by the Director-General](page 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The official release is accessed via [https://icd.who.int icd.who.int]

* About 300 specialists of 55 countries, organized in 30 main working groups have provided their input to make ICD-11 scientifically up-to-date, and structural problems that became apparent using ICD-10 have been solved.  
* ICD-11 is much easier to use than ICD-10. Its ontological infrastructure allows for an improved user guidance compared to ICD-10.
* The systematic reliance on the use of code combinations and extension codes makes ICD finally clinically relevant. With the combinations any condition can be coded to the desired level of detail.
* Primary care, cancer coding, traditional medicine (currently module 1: ancient Chinese medicine - China, Korea and Japan), and a section for assessment of functioning are now included.
* Specialty versions, as for mental health, primary care, or dermatology are produced from the common core, the foundation.
* ICD-11 is truly multilingual. ICD-10 exists in 43 Languages in electronic versions and ICD-11 has already 15 translations in progress. The tooling produces all files and formats from the core translation tooling on the [https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en maintenance platform] .  For authorization of  translations, requests have to be made to WHO.
* ICD-11 is digital health (formerly e-health) ready due to the use of uniform resource identifiers and its ontological underpinning.  The system allows connection of any software through a standard API.  The same package is also prepared for use offline.
* ICD-11 is based on the electronic foundation component that contains all content, structural information, references and discriptors in a machine readable format. The content is then rendered for machine or human use, electronically or in print.
* In ICD-11, each disease entity has a description that give key descriptions and guidance on what the meaning of the entity/category is in human-readable terms, to guide users. This is an advancement over ICD-10, which had only title headings. The Definitions have a standard structure according to a template with standard definition templates and further features exemplified in a "Content Model". The Content Model is a structured framework that captures the knowledge that underpins the definition of an ICD entity.  The Content Model therefore allows computerization (with links to ontologies and [[SNOMED CT]]). Each ICD entity can be seen from different dimensions or "parameters". For example, there are currently 13 defined main parameters in the Content Model (see below) to describe a category in ICD.

An external review of the ICD-11 Revision has been completed. The report notes the progress in the ICD Revision, and makes clear recommendations about forward progress in the revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclive.in/international-classification-diseases/|title=Revision of International Classification Diseases by 2018 - ABC Live|website=Abclive.in|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICD-11 invokes a more sophisticated architecture than historical versions, consistent with its generation as a digital resource.  The core content of the system, called the Foundation Component, is a semantic network of words and terms, where any given term can have more than one parent.  To address the requirement that statistical classifications exhibit mutual exclusiveness (so events are not counted more than once) and exhaustiveness (so there is a place to tally all events), ICD11 supports the serialization of the Foundation Component into an arbitrary number of linearizations, optimized for use cases.  The main linearization, presently called the Joint Linearization for Morbidity and Mortality Statistics, is the tabular format with which most traditional users will become familiar. However, other linearizations, for primary care, multiple sub-specialty derivatives, or applications such as clinical decision support are possible.  Finally, preliminary work in partnership with the [[IHTSDO]] is underway to ensure that the ICD-11 Foundation Component is semantically coherent through development of the Common Ontology, a subset of [[SNOMED CT]] which will anchor the Foundation Component to terms defined through [[description logic]].

== Usage in the United States ==
In the United States, the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] published ''The International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for Indexing of Hospital Records and Operation Classification (ICDA),'' completed in 1962 and expanding the ICD-7 in a number of areas to more completely meet the indexing needs of [[hospital]]s. The U.S. Public Health Service later published the ''Eighth Revision, International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for Use in the United States,'' commonly referred to as ICDA-8, for official national morbidity and mortality statistics. This was followed by the ''ICD, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification'', known as ICD-9-CM, published by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] and used by hospitals and other healthcare facilities to better describe the clinical picture of the [[patient]]. The diagnosis component of ICD-9-CM is completely consistent with ICD-9 codes, and remains the data standard for reporting morbidity. National adaptations of the ICD-10 progressed to incorporate both clinical code (ICD-10-CM) and procedure code (ICD-10-PCS) with the revisions completed in 2003. In 2009, the U.S. [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] announced that it would begin using ICD-10 on April 1, 2010, with full compliance by all involved parties by 2013.&lt;ref Name="CMS_PressAug2008"&gt;{{cite press release However, the US extended the deadline twice and did not formally require transitioning to ICD-10-CM (for most clinical encounters) until October 1, 2015.

The ICD includes a section classifying mental and behavioral disorders ([[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders|Chapter V]]). This has developed alongside the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and the two manuals seek to use the same codes. The WHO is revising their classifications in these sections as part the development of the ICD-11 (scheduled for 2018), and an "International Advisory Group" has been established to guide this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/en/ Who | Mental Health Evidence And Research (Mer)]. Who.int. Retrieved on 2014-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Section F66 of the ICD-10 deals with classifications of psychological and behavioural disorders that are associated with sexual development and orientation.  It explicitly states that "sexual orientation by itself is not to be considered a disorder," in line with the DSM and other classifications that recognise homosexuality as a normal variation in human sexuality.  The Working Group has reported that there is "no evidence that [these classifications] are clinically useful" and recommended that section F66 be deleted for the ICD-11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Proposed declassification of disease categories related to sexual orientation in the ''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems'' (ICD-11)|first1 = Susan D.|last1 = Cochran|first2 = Jack|last2 = Drescher|authorlink2 = Jack Drescher|first3 = Eszter|last3 = Kismödi|first4 = Alain|last4 = Giami|first5 = Claudia|last5 = García-Moreno|first6 = Elham|last6 = Atalla|first7 = Adele|last7 = Marais|first8 = Elisabeth|last8 = Meloni Vieira|first9 = Geoffrey M.|last9 = Reed|journal = [[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]]|year = 2014|volume = 92|issue = 9|pages = 672–679|doi = 10.2471/BLT.14.135541|pmc = 4208576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international survey of psychiatrists in 66 countries comparing use of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV found that the former was more often used for clinical diagnosis while the latter was more valued for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juan E. Mezzich|first=|year=2002|title=International Surveys on the Use of ICD-10 and Related Diagnostic Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;id=EE-YRUki3LEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA72&amp;ots=Co5-cRTL0Y&amp;sig=VLwS93hNIFC-52zk2B9OnTp2By4&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|format=guest editorial, abstract|journal=Psychopathology|volume=35|issue=2–3|pages=72–75|doi=10.1159/000065122|issn=|pmid=12145487|quote=|via=|month=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD is actually the official system for the US, although many mental health professionals do not realize this due to the dominance of the DSM. A psychologist has stated: "Serious problems with the clinical utility of both the ICD and the DSM are widely acknowledged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geoffrey M.

Physik. 1883, 2, 18, p. 663.&lt;/ref&gt; uses [[Green's identities]] to derive the solution to the homogeneous [[wave equation]] at an arbitrary point '''P''' in terms of the values of the solution of the wave equation and its first-order derivative at all points on an arbitrary surface that encloses '''P'''.&lt;ref name = "Born and Wolf"&gt;Max Born and Emil Wolf, Principles of Optics, 1999, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 417–420.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equation==

===Monochromatic waves===

The integral has the following form for a [[monochromatic]] wave:&lt;ref name = "Born and Wolf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Fourier Optics J. Goodman sec. 3.3.3&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;U(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_S \left[ U \frac{\partial}{\partial\hat{\mathbf{n}}} \left( \frac{e^{iks}}{s} \right) - \frac{e^{iks}}{s} \frac{\partial U}{\partial\hat{\mathbf{n}}} \right] dS,&lt;/math&gt;

where the integration is performed over an arbitrary [[closed surface]] ''S'' (enclosing '''r'''), ''s'' is the distance from the surface element to the point '''r''', and ∂/∂'''n''' denotes differentiation along the surface normal (a [[normal derivative]]). Note that in this equation the normal points inside the enclosed volume; if the more usual [[Normal (geometry)#Uniqueness of the normal|outer-pointing normal]] is used, the integral has the opposite sign.

===Non-monochromatic waves===

A more  general form can be derived for non-monochromatic waves.  The [[complex amplitude]] of the wave can be represented by a Fourier integral of the form

:&lt;math&gt;V(r,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int U_\omega(r) e^{-i\omega t} \,d\omega,&lt;/math&gt;

where, by [[Fourier inversion theorem|Fourier inversion]], we have

:&lt;math&gt;U_\omega(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int V(r,t) e^{i\omega t} \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral theorem (above) is applied to each Fourier component &lt;math&gt;U_\omega&lt;/math&gt;, and the following expression is obtained:&lt;ref name="Born and Wolf"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V(r,t) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_S \left\{[V] \frac {\partial}{\partial n} \left(\frac {1}{s}\right) - \frac {1}{cs} \frac {\partial s}{\partial n} \left[\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}\right] - \frac{1}{s} \left[\frac{\partial V}{\partial n} \right] \right\} dS,&lt;/math&gt;

where the square brackets on ''V'' terms denote retarded values, i.e. the values at time ''t'' − ''s''/''c''.

Kirchhoff showed that the above equation can be approximated in many cases to a simpler form, known as the [[Kirchhoff's diffraction formula|Kirchhoff, or Fresnel–Kirchhoff diffraction formula]], which is equivalent to the [[Huygens–Fresnel equation]], but provides a formula for the inclination factor, which is not defined in the latter.  The diffraction integral can be applied to a wide range of problems in optics.

[[File:LIFE power plant.jpg|thumb|Rendering of the LIFE.1 fusion power plant. The fusion system is in the large cylindrical containment building in the center.]]
'''LIFE''', short for '''Laser Inertial Fusion Energy''', was a [[fusion energy]] effort run at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] between 2008 and 2013. LIFE aimed to develop the technologies necessary to convert the laser-driven [[inertial confinement fusion]] concept being developed in the [[National Ignition Facility]] (NIF) into a practical commercial [[Power station|power plant]], a concept known generally as [[inertial fusion energy]] (IFE). LIFE used the same basic concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and [[diode laser]]s with higher electrical efficiency.

Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid [[Nuclear fusion–fission hybrid|fusion-fission system]]. In the former, the energy generated by the fusion reactions is used directly. In the later, the [[neutron]]s given off by the fusion reactions are used to cause [[Nuclear fission|fission]] reactions in a surrounding blanket of [[uranium]] or other [[nuclear fuel]], and those fission events are responsible for most of the energy release. In both cases, conventional [[steam turbine]] systems are used to extract the heat and produce electricity.

Construction on NIF completed in 2009 and it began a lengthy series of run-up tests to bring it to full power. Through 2011 and into 2012, NIF ran the "national ignition campaign" to reach the point at which the [[Fusion ignition|fusion reaction becomes self-sustaining]], a key goal that is a basic requirement of any practical IFE system. NIF failed in this goal, with fusion performance that was well below ignition levels and differing considerably from predictions. With the problem of ignition unsolved, the LIFE project was cancelled in 2013.

== Background ==
[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) has been a leader in laser-driven [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) since the initial concept was developed by LLNL employee [[John Nuckols]] in the late 1950s.{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|pp=1–2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nuckolls|first=John|last2=Wood|first2=Lowell|last3=Thiessen|first3=Albert|last4=Zimmerman|first4=George|date=1972|title=Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/abs/239139a0.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=239|issue=5368|pages=139–142|doi=10.1038/239139a0|bibcode=1972Natur.239..139N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea was to use a ''driver'' to compress a small pellet known as the ''target'' that contains the fusion fuel, a mix of [[deuterium]] (D) and [[tritium]] (T). If the compression reaches high enough values, fusion reactions begin to take place, releasing [[alpha particle]]s and [[neutron]]s. The alphas may impact atoms in the surrounding fuel, heating them to the point where they undergo fusion as well. If the rate of alpha heating is higher than heat losses to the environment, the result is a self-sustaining chain reaction known as [[Fusion ignition|ignition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/how-nif-works/ |title=How NIF works |website=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Comparing the driver energy input to the fusion energy output produces a number known as [[fusion energy gain factor]], labelled ''Q''. A ''Q'' value of at least 1 is required for the system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, ''Q'' has to be at least 3.{{sfn|Bethe|1979|p=45}} For commercial operation, ''Q'' values much higher than this are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feresin |first=Emiliano |title=Fusion reactor aims to rival ITER |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100430/full/news.2010.214.html |journal=Nature |date=30 April 2010 |doi=10.1038/news.2010.214}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ICF, ''Q''s on the order of 25 to 50 are needed to recoup both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;MJ.{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|p=4}}

At the time, a number of different drivers were considered, but the introduction of the [[laser]] later that year provided the first obvious solution with the right combination of features. The desired energies were well beyond the [[state of the art]] in laser design, so LLNL began a development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels.{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|loc=Figure 4}} Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with the laser teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using [[computer simulation]]s adapted from [[thermonuclear bomb]] work developed a program known as [[LASNEX]] that suggested ''Q'' of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that the laser team were now able to deliver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |first=G |last=Zimmerman |url=https://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/5207118 |title=The LASNEX Code for Inertial Confinement Fusion |publisher=Lawrence Livermore Laboratory |date=6 October 1977 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lindl|1993|loc=Figure 5}}

From the late-1970s, LLNL developed a series of machines to reach the conditions being predicted by LASNEX and other simulations. With each iteration, the experimental results demonstrated that the simulations were incorrect. The first machine, the [[Shiva laser]] of the late 1970s, produced compression on the order of 50 to 100 times, but did not produce fusion reactions anywhere near the expected levels. The problem was traced to the issue of the [[infrared]] laser light heating electrons and mixing them in the fuel, and it was suggested that using [[ultraviolet]] light would solve the problem. This was addressed on the [[Nova laser]] of the 1980s, which was designed with the specific intent of producing ignition. Nova did produce large quantities of fusion, with ''shots'' producing as much as {{10^|7}} neutrons, but failed to reach ignition. This was traced to the growth of [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability|Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities]], which greatly increased the required driver power.{{sfn|Lindl|1993|loc=Figure 8}}

Ultimately all of these problems were considered to be well understood, and a much larger design emerged, NIF. NIF was designed to provide about twice the required driver energy, allowing some margin of error. NIF's design was finalized in 1994, with construction to be completed by 2002. Construction began in 1997 but took over a decade to complete, with major construction being declared complete in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ann |last=Parker |url=https://str.llnl.gov/str/September02/September50th.html |title=Enpowering Light: Historic Accomplishments in Laser Research |journal=Science &amp; Technology Review |date=September 2002 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the development of the ICF concept at LLNL and elsewhere, several small efforts had been made to consider the design of a commercial power plant based on the ICF concept. Examples include SOLASE-H&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |title=SOLASE-H, A Laser Fusion Hybrid Study |url=http://www.ralphmoir.com/media/uWFDM270.pdf |publisher=Fusion Technology Institute, University of Wisconsin |date=May 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; and HYLIFE-II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://hifweb.lbl.gov/public/Sharp/HIF_documents/Moir-HYYLIFE%20II%20design.pdf |title=HYLIFE-II Inertial Confinement Fusion Power Plant Design |last=Moir |first=Ralph |date=1992 |journal=Particle Accelerators |pages=467–480}}&lt;/ref&gt; As NIF was reaching completion in 2008, with the various concerns considered solved, LLNL began a more serious IFE development effort, LIFE.{{sfn|LIFE}}

=== Fusion–fission hybrid ===
When the LIFE project was first proposed, it focused on the [[nuclear fusion–fission hybrid]] concept, which uses the [[fast neutrons]] from the fusion reactions to induce fission in [[Fertile material|fertile nuclear materials]].{{sfn|Bethe|1979|p=44}} The hybrid concept was designed to generate power from both fertile and fissile nuclear fuel and to burn nuclear waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Kevin J.|last2=Latkowski|first2=Jeffery F.|last3=Abbott|first3=Ryan P.|last4=Boyd|first4=John K.|last5=Powers|first5=Jeffrey J.|last6=Seifried|first6=Jeffrey E.|date=2009|title=Neutron Transport and Nuclear Burnup Analysis for the Laser Inertial Confinement Fusion-Fission Energy (LIFE) Engine|url=http://web.mit.edu/fusion-fission/HybridsPubli/LIFE_TOFE/Kramer.pdf|journal=Fusion Science and Technology|volume=56|issue=2|pages=625–631|doi=10.13182/FST18-8132|issn=1536-1055}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moses|first=Edward I.|last2=Diaz de la Rubia|first2=Tomas|last3=Storm|first3=Erik|last4=Latkowski|first4=Jeffery F.|last5=Farmer|first5=Joseph C.|last6=Abbott|first6=Ryan P.|last7=Kramer|first7=Kevin J.|last8=Peterson|first8=Per F.|last9=Shaw|first9=Henry F.|date=2009|title=A Sustainable Nuclear Fuel Cycle Based on Laser Inertial Fusion Energy|url=http://web.mit.edu/fusion-fission/HybridsPubli/LIFE_TOFE/Moses.pdf|journal=Fusion Science and Technology|volume=56|issue=2|pages=547–565|doi=10.13182/FST09-34|issn=1536-1055}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|last=Kramer|first=Kevin James|date=2010|title=Laser inertial fusion-based energy: Neutronic design aspects of a hybrid fusion-fission nuclear energy system|url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/391107.pdf|work=Ph.D. Thesis|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fuel blanket was designed to use [[Nuclear fuel#TRISO fuel|TRISO-based fuel]] cooled by a [[FLiBe|molten salt]] made from a mixture of&amp;nbsp;[[lithium fluoride]]&amp;nbsp;(LiF) and&amp;nbsp;[[beryllium fluoride]]&amp;nbsp;(BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Kevin J.|last2=Fratoni|first2=Massimiliano|last3=Latkowski|first3=Jeffery F.|last4=Abbott|first4=Ryan P.|last5=Anklam|first5=Thomas M.|last6=Beckett|first6=Elizabeth M.|last7=Bayramian|first7=Andy J.|last8=DeMuth|first8=James A.|last9=Deri|first9=Robert J.|date=2011|title=Fusion-Fission Blanket Options for the LIFE Engine|url=http://jeffseif.info/pdf/kramer2011ffb.pdf|journal=Fusion Science and Technology|volume=60|issue=1|pages=72–77|doi=10.13182/FST10-295|issn=1536-1055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional fission power plants rely on the chain reaction caused when fission events release thermal neutrons that cause further fission events. Each fission event in [[U-235]] releases two or three neutrons with about 2&amp;nbsp;MeV of [[kinetic energy]]. By careful arrangement and the use of various absorber materials, designers can balance the system so one of those neutrons causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This balance is known as [[critical mass|criticality]]. [[Natural uranium]] is a mix of three isotopes; mainly [[Uranium-238|U-238]], with some U-235, and trace amounts of U-234. The neutrons released in the fission of either of the main isotopes will cause fission in U-235, but not in U-238, which requires higher energies around 5&amp;nbsp;MeV. There is not enough U-235 in natural uranium to reach criticality. Commercial [[Light water reactor|light water nuclear reactors]], the most prevalent power reactors in the world, use [[nuclear fuel]] containing uranium enriched to 3 to 5% U-235 while the leftover is U-238.{{sfn|Brennen|2005|p=16}}{{sfn|Brennen|2005|p=19}}

Each fusion event in the D-T fusion reactor gives off an [[alpha particle]] and a [[fast neutron]] with around 14&amp;nbsp;MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other [[transuranic]] elements as well. This reaction is used in [[H-bomb]]s to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of [[depleted uranium]], which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept can also be used with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a ''blanket'' of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value,{{efn|Or, more typically, when the products of previous fission events "poison" the ongoing reaction by capturing neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Fission Product Poisoning |url=https://canteach.candu.org/Content%20Library/20053712.pdf |date=July 1979 |work=Nuclear Theory, Course 227}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as ''energy multiplication''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Fusion Energy |publisher=Allied Publishers |date=2002 |page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.{{sfn|Bethe|1979|p=44}}

In most fusion energy designs, fusion neutrons react with a blanket of lithium to breed new tritium for fuel. A major issue with the fission–fusion design is that the neutrons causing fission are no longer available for tritium breeding. While the fission reactions release additional neutrons, these do not have enough energy to complete the breeding reaction with Li-7, which makes up more than 92% of natural lithium. These lower energy neutrons will cause breeding in Li-6, which could be concentrated from the natural lithium ore. However, the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium per neutron captured, and more than one T per neutron is needed to make up for natural decay and other losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |first=D. |last=Morrow |url=http://fire.pppl.gov/jason_tritium_fusion_2011.pdf |title=Tritium |publisher=JASON Panel |date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Li-6, neutrons from the fission would make up for the losses, but only at the cost of removing them from causing other fission reactions, lowering the reactor power output. The designer has to choose which is more important; burning up the fuel through fusion neutrons, or providing power through self-induced fission events.{{sfn|Bethe|1979|p=46}}

The economics of fission–fusion designs have always been questionable. The same basic effect can be created by replacing the central fusion reactor with a specially designed fission reactor, and using the surplus neutrons from the fission to breed fuel in the blanket. These [[breeder reactor#fast breeder reactor|fast breeder reactors]] have proven uneconomical in practice, and the greater expense of the fusion systems in the fission–fusion hybrid has always suggested they would be uneconomical unless built in very large units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=Tenney |first1=F. |last2=Bathke |first2=C. |display-authors=1 |title=A Systems Study of Tokamak Fusion–Fission Reactors |url=http://www.ralphmoir.com/media/tenneyMerged.pdf |date=November 1978 |publisher=Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory |pages=336–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pure IFE ===
[[File:NIF target chamber construction.jpg|thumb|The National Ignition Facility's target chamber's multi-part construction would also be used in LIFE. Several chambers would be used in a production power plant, allowing them to be swapped out for maintenance.]]

The LIFE concept stopped working along fusion-fission lines around 2009. Following consultations with their partners in the utility industry, the project was redirected toward a pure fusion design with a net electrical output around 1 gigawatt.{{sfn|Dunne|2010|p=2}}

[[Inertial confinement fusion]]&amp;nbsp;is one of two major lines of fusion power development, the other being [[magnetic fusion energy|magnetic confinement fusion]] (MCF), notably the [[tokamak]] concept which is being built in a major experimental system known as [[ITER]]. Magnetic confinement is widely considered to be the superior approach, and has seen significantly greater development activity over the decades. However, there are serious concerns that the MCF approach of ITER cannot ever become economically practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Revkin |first=Andrew |title=With Tight Research Budgets, Is There Room for the Eternal Promise of Fusion? |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/with-tight-research-budgets-is-there-room-for-the-eternal-promise-of-fusion/ |publisher=The New York Times |date=18 October 2012 |accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the cost concerns for MCF designs like ITER is that the reactor materials are subject to the intense [[neutron]] flux created by the fusion reactions. When high-energy neutrons impact materials they displace the atoms in the structure leading to a problem known as [[Wigner effect|neutron embrittlement]] that degrades the structural integrity of the material. This is a problem for fission reactors as well, but the neutron flux and energy in a tokamak is greater than most fission designs. In most MFE designs, the reactor is constructed in layers, with a toroidal inner vacuum chamber, or "first wall", then the lithium blanket, and finally the [[superconducting magnet]]s that produce the field that confines the plasma. Neutrons stopping in the blanket are desirable, but those that stop in the first wall or magnets degrade them. Disassembling a toroidal stack of elements would be a time-consuming process that would lead to poor [[capacity factor]], which has a significant impact on the economics of the system. Reducing this effect requires the use of exotic materials which have not yet been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bloom |first=Everett |title=The challenge of developing structural materials for fusion power systems |journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials |date=1998 |url=http://web.ornl.gov/sci/physical_sciences_directorate/mst/fusionreactor/pdf/selectedpubs/challenge.pdf |doi=10.1016/s0022-3115(98)00352-3 |volume=258-263 |pages=7–17 |bibcode = 1998JNuM..258....7B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a natural side-effect of the size of the fuel elements and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the [[inverse square law]]. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.&lt;ref name=adv&gt;{{cite web |url=https://life.llnl.gov/why_life/life_advantages.php |title=Why LIFE: Advantages of the LIFE Approach |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506011449/https://life.llnl.gov/why_life/life_advantages.php |archive-date=6 May 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IFE limitations ===
[[File:Nif flashlamps.jpg|thumb|right|NIF's huge flashlamps are both inefficient and impractical. LIFE explored solutions to replace these lamps with smaller and much more efficient LED lasers.]]

NIF's laser uses a system of large [[flashtube]]s (like those in a photography flashlamp) to optically ''[[Laser pumping|pump]]'' a large number of glass plates. Once the plates are flashed and have settled into a [[population inversion]], a small signal from a separate laser is fed into the optical lines, stimulating the emission in the plates. The plates then dump their stored energy into the growing beam, amplifying it billions of times.&lt;ref name=how /&gt;

The process is extremely inefficient in energy terms; NIF feeds the flashtubes over 400&amp;nbsp;MJ of energy which produces 1.8&amp;nbsp;MJ of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light. Due to limitations of the target chamber, NIF is only able to handle fusion outputs up to about 50&amp;nbsp;MJ, although shots would generally be about half of that. Accounting for losses in generation, perhaps 20&amp;nbsp;MJ of electrical energy might be extracted at the maximum, accounting for less than {{frac|20}} of the input energy.&lt;ref name=how&gt;{{cite web |title=How NIF works |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/how-nif-works |website=National Ignition Facility &amp; Photon Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem with the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a significant amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/news/photons-fusion/2014/march |title= Plans to Increase NIF's Shot Rate Capability Described |journal=Photons &amp; Fusion Newsletter |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.

When originally conceived by Nuckols, laser-driven inertial fusion confinement was expected to require lasers of a few hundred kilojoules and use fuel droplets created by a [[Nebulizer|perfume mister]] arrangement.{{sfn|Nuckolls|1998|p=5}} LLNLs research since that time has demonstrated that such an arrangement cannot work, and requires machined assemblies for each shot. To be economically useful, an IFE machine would need to use fuel assemblies that cost pennies. Although LLNL does not release prices for their own targets, the similar system at the [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics]] at the [[University of Rochester]] makes targets for about $1 million each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Moyer |title=Fusion's False Dawn |magazine=Scientific American |date=March 2010 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that NIF's targets cost more than $10,000.{{sfn|Courtland|2013}}{{sfn|Sutton|2011}}

=== Mercury ===
LLNL had begun exploring different solutions to the laser problem while the system was first being described. In 1996 they built a small testbed system known as the [[Mercury laser]] that replaced the flashtubes with laser diodes.{{sfn|Mercury}}

One advantage of this design was that the diodes created light around the same frequency as the laser glass' output,{{sfn|Ebbers|2009}} as compared to the white light flashtubes where most of the energy in the flash was wasted as it was not near the active frequency of the laser glass.{{sfn|Laser}} This change increased the energy efficiency to about 10%, a dramatic improvement.{{sfn|Mercury}}

For any given amount of light energy created, the diode lasers give off about {{frac|3}} as much heat as a flashtube. Less heat, combined with active cooling in the form of helium blown between the diodes and the laser glass layers, eliminated the warming of the glass and allows Mercury to run continually.{{sfn|Ebbers|2009}} In 2008, Mercury was able to fire 10 times a second at 50 joules per shot for hours at a time.{{sfn|Mercury}}

Several other projects running in parallel with Mercury explored various cooling methods and concepts allowing many laser diodes to be packed into a very small space. These eventually produced a system with 100&amp;nbsp;kW of laser energy from a box about {{convert|50|cm}} long, known as a diode array. In a LIFE design, these arrays would replace the less dense diode packaging of the Mercury design.{{sfn|Mercury}}

=== Beam-in-a-box ===
LIFE was essentially a combination of the Mercury concepts and new physical arrangements to greatly reduce the volume of the NIF while making it much easier to build and maintain. Whereas an NIF beamline for one of its 192 lasers is over {{convert|100|metres}} long, LIFE was based on a design about {{convert|10.5|m}} long that contained everything from the power supplies to frequency conversion optics. Each module was completely independent, unlike NIF which is fed from a central signal from the Master Oscillator, allowing the units to be individually removed and replaced while the system as a whole continued operation.{{sfn|Bayramian|2012}}

Each driver cell in the LIFE baseline design contained two of the high-density diode arrays arranged on either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes at either end of the module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and [[Pockels effect|Pockel's cell]] [[optical switch]]. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF.{{sfn|Ebbers|2009}} Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics on either side of the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.{{sfn|Bayramian|2012}}

The small size and independence of the laser modules allowed the huge NIF building to be dispensed with. Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact arrangement. In baseline designs, the modules were stacked in 2-wide by 8-high groups in two rings above and below the target chamber, shining their light through small holes drilled into the chamber to protect them from the neutron flux coming back out.{{sfn|Economic}}

The ultimate goal was to produce a system that could be shipped in a conventional semi-trailer truck to the power plant, providing laser energy with 18% end-to-end efficiency, 15 times that of the NIF system. This reduces the required fusion gains into the 25 to 50 area, within the predicted values for NIF. The consensus was that this "beam-in-a-box" system could be built for 3 cents per Watt of laser output, and that would reduce to 0.7 cents/W in sustained production. This would mean that a complete LIFE plant would require about $600&amp;nbsp;million worth of diodes alone, significant, but within the realm of economic possibility.{{sfn|Bayramian|2012}}

=== Inexpensive targets ===
[[File:Nif-shot target-arm-before big.jpg|thumb|right|NIF's targets (centered, in the holder) are expensive machined assemblies that cost thousands of dollars each. LIFE worked with industry partners to reduce this to under a dollar.]]

Targets for NIF are extremely expensive. Each one consists of a small open ended metal cylinder with transparent double-pane windows sealing each end. In order to efficiently convert the driver laser's light to the [[x-rays]] that drive the compression, the cylinder has to be coated in gold or other [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]]. Inside, suspended on fine plastic wires, is a hollow plastic sphere containing the fuel. In order to provide symmetrical implosion, the metal cylinder and plastic sphere have extremely high machining tolerances. The fuel, normally a gas at room temperature, is deposited inside the sphere and then cryogenically frozen until it sticks to the inside of the sphere. It is then smoothed by slowly warming it with an infrared laser to form a 100&amp;nbsp;µm smooth layer on the inside of the pellet. Each target costs tens of thousands of dollars.{{sfn|Courtland|2013}}

To address this concern, a considerable amount of LIFE's effort was put into the development of simplified target designs and automated construction that would lower their cost. Working with [[General Atomics]], the LIFE team developed a concept using on-site fuel factories that would mass-produce pellets at a rate of about a million a day. It was expected that this would reduce their price to about 25 cents per target,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is LIFE? |url=https://life.llnl.gov/what_is_life/learning_center/inertial_fusion.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150404171900/https://life.llnl.gov/why_life/life_advantages.php |archive-date=2015-04-04 |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although other references suggest the target price was closer to 50 cents, and LLNL's own estimates range from 20 to 30 cents.{{sfn|Dunne|2010|p=8}}

One less obvious advantage to the LIFE concept is that the amount of tritium required to start the system up is greatly reduced over MFE concepts. In MFE, a relatively large amount of fuel is prepared and put into the reactor, requiring much of the world's entire civilian tritium supply just for startup. LIFE, by virtue of the tiny amount of fuel in any one pellet, can begin operations with much less tritium, on the order of {{frac|10}}.&lt;ref name=adv /&gt;

=== Overall design ===
[[File:LIFE fusion chamber.jpg|thumb|LIFE.1/MEP's fusion system. The lasers are the grey boxes arranged in groups at the top and bottom of the containment building (the lower ones are just visible). Their light, in blue, is bounced through the optical paths into the target chamber in the center. The machinery on the left circulates the liquid lithium or [[FLiBe]], which removes heat from the chamber to cool it, provides heat to the generators, and extracts tritium for fuel.]]

The early fusion-fission designs were not well developed and only schematic outlines of the concept were shown. These systems looked like a scaled down version of NIF, with beamlines about {{convert|100|m}} long on either side of a target chamber and power generation area. The laser produced 1.4&amp;nbsp;MJ of UV light 13 times a second. The fusion took place in a {{convert|2.5|m}} target chamber that was surrounded by {{convert|40|ST|kg}} of unenriched fission fuel, or alternately about {{convert|7|ST|kg}} of Pu or [[Enriched uranium|highly enriched uranium]] from weapons. The fusion system was expected to produce ''Q'' on the order of 25 to 30, resulting in 350 to 500&amp;nbsp;MW of fusion energy. The fission processes triggered by the fusion would add an additional energy gain of 4 to 10 times, resulting in a total thermal output between 2000 and 5000&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;. Using high efficiency [[Energy conversion efficiency|thermal-to-electric conversion]] systems like [[Rankine cycle]] designs in combination with demonstrated [[supercritical steam generator]]s would allow about half of the thermal output to be turned into electricity.{{sfn|Moses|2009|loc=Figure 1}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meier|first=W.

By 2012, the baseline design of the pure fusion concept, known as the Market Entry Plant (MEP),{{efn|Referred to as LIFE.1 in other documents.{{sfn|NSF|2013|p=58}}}} had stabilized. This was a self-contained design with the entire fusion section packaged into a cylindrical concrete building not unlike a fission reactor confinement building, although larger at {{convert|100|m}} diameter.{{sfn|Dunne|2010|p=3}} The central building was flanked by smaller rectangular buildings on either side, one containing the turbines and power handling systems, the other the tritium plant. A third building, either attached to the plant or behind it depending on the diagram, was used for maintenance.{{sfn|Dunne|2010|p=5}}

Inside the central fusion building, the beam-in-a-box lasers were arranged in two rings, one above and one below the target chamber. A total of 384 lasers would provide 2.2&amp;nbsp;MJ of UV light at a 0.351 micrometer wavelength,{{sfn|Ebbers|2009}} producing a ''Q'' of 21. A [[light gas gun]] was used to fire 15 targets a second into the target chamber.{{sfn|Anklam|2010|p=5}} With each shot, the temperature of the target chamber's inner wall is raised from {{convert|600|°C|°F}} to {{convert|800|°C|°F}}.{{sfn|Dunne|2010|p=4}}

The target chamber is a two-wall structure filled with liquid [[lithium]] or a lithium alloy between the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latkowski|first=Jeffery F.|date=2011-07-01|title=Chamber Design for the Laser Inertial Fusion Energy (LIFE) Engine|url=http://www.ans.org/pubs/journals/fst/a_12327|journal=Fusion Science and Technology|volume=60|issue=1|pages=54–60|doi=10.13182/fst10-318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lithium captures neutrons from the reactions to breed tritium, and also acts as the primary coolant loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reyes|first=S.|last2=Anklam|first2=T.|last3=Babineau|first3=D.|last4=Becnel|first4=J.|last5=Davis|first5=R.|last6=Dunne|first6=M.|last7=Farmer|first7=J.|last8=Flowers|first8=D.|last9=Kramer|first9=K.|date=2013|title=LIFE Tritium Processing: A Sustainable Solution for Closing the Fusion Fuel Cycle|url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/651552.pdf|journal=Fusion Science and Technology|volume=64|issue=2|pages=187–193|doi=10.13182/FST12-529|issn=1536-1055}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chamber is filled with [[xenon]] gas that would slow the ions from the reaction as well as protect the inner wall, or ''first wall'', from the massive [[x-ray]] flux.{{sfn|Dunne|2010|p=5}} Because the chamber is not highly pressurized, like a fission core, it does not have to be built as a single sphere. Instead, the LIFE chamber is built from eight identical sections that include built-in connections to the cooling loop. They are shipped to the plant and bolted together on two supports, and then surrounded by a tube-based space frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://life.llnl.gov/life_design/fusion_system.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522032245/https://life.llnl.gov/life_design/fusion_system.php |archive-date=22 May 2016 |title=LIFE Design: Fusion System |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To deal with embrittlement, the entire target chamber was designed to be easily rolled out of the center of the building on rails to the maintenance building where it could be rebuilt. The chamber was expected to last four years, and be replaced in one month. The optical system is decoupled from the chamber, which isolates it from vibrations during operation and means that the beamlines themselves do not have to be realigned after chamber replacement.{{sfn|Dunne|2010|p=5}}

The plant had a peak generation capability, or [[nameplate capacity]], of about 400&amp;nbsp;MWe, with design features to allow expansion to as much as 1000&amp;nbsp;MWe.{{sfn|Dunne|2010|p=6}}

The [[levelized cost of electricity]] (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by the total amount of electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense ([[Capital expenditure|CAPEX]]) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the [[capacity factor]] (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a [[figure of merit]] for the cost of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/tech_lcoe_documentation.html |title= Simple Levelized Cost of Energy Calculation |website=NREL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MEP was not intended to be a production design, and would be able to export only small amounts of electricity. It would, however, serve as the basis for the first production model, LIFE.2. LIFE.2 would produce 2.2&amp;nbsp;GW of fusion energy and convert that to 1&amp;nbsp;GW of electrical at 48% efficiency.{{sfn|Anklam|2010|p=5}} Over a year, LIFE would produce 365 days x 24 hours x 0.9 capacity factor x 1,000,000&amp;nbsp;kW nameplate rating = 8&amp;nbsp;billion kWh. In order to generate that power, the system will have to burn 365 x 24 x 60 minutes x 60 seconds x 15 pellets per second x 0.9 capacity = 425&amp;nbsp;million fuel pellets. If the pellets cost the suggested price of 50 cents each, that is over $200&amp;nbsp;million a year to fuel the plant. The average rate for wholesale electricity in the US {{asof|lc=yes|2015}} is around 5 cents/kWh,&lt;ref name="eia.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/electricity/wholesale/ |title=Wholesale Electricity and Natural Gas Market Data |date=19 March 2015 |website=Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; so this power has a commercial value of about $212&amp;nbsp;million, suggesting that LIFE.2 would just barely cover, on average, its own fuel costs.{{efn|Wholesale prices have dropped since 2015, {{asof|2018|lc=yes}}, the average cost is closer to 3 cents/kWh, which means LIFE.2 would lose money even at the cheapest possible target prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/update/wholesale_markets.php |title= Electricity Monthly Update |date= November 2018 |website= EIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

CAPEX for the plant is estimated to $6.4&amp;nbsp;billion, so financing the plant over a 20-year period adds another $5&amp;nbsp;billion assuming the 6.5% unsecured rate. Considering CAPEX and fuel alone, the total cost of the plant is 6.4 + 5 + 4 = $15.4&amp;nbsp;billion. Dividing the total cost by the energy produced over the same period gives a rough estimate of the cost of electricity for a 20-year lifetime operation: $15.4&amp;nbsp;billion / 160&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;kWh = 9.6&amp;nbsp;cents/kWh. A 40-year operation lifetime would lead to a cost of electricity of 4.8&amp;nbsp;cents/kWh. LLNL calculated the LCoE of LIFE.2 at 9.1 cents using the discounted cash flow methodology described in the 2009 MIT report "the Future of Nuclear Energy".{{sfn|Anklam|2010|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Future of nuclear power|first=|date=2003|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=978-0-615-12420-9|location=|pages=|oclc=803925974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using either value, LIFE.2 would be unable to compete with modern [[renewable energy]] souces, which are well below 5 cents/kWh {{asof|2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |url=https://www.lazard.com/media/450773/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-120-vfinal.pdf |title= Lazard’s Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis—Version 12.0 |date=October 2018 |publisher= Lazard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LLNL projected that further development after widespread commercial deployment might lead to further technology improvements and cost reductions, and proposed a LIFE.3 design of about $6.3&amp;nbsp;billion CAPEX and 1.6&amp;nbsp;GW nameplate for a [[price per watt]] of $4.2/W. This leads to a projected LCoE of 5.5 cents/kWh,{{sfn|Anklam|2010|p=5}} which is competitive with offshore wind {{asof|2018}},{{sfn|Lazard|2014|p=2}} but unlikely to be so in 2040 when LIFE.3 designs would start construction.{{efn|LCoE on wind turbines declined (improved) by 58% between 2009 and 2014, to just over 5.5 cents/kWh.{{sfn|Lazard|2014|p=9}}}} LIFE plants would be wholesale sellers, competing against a baseload rate of about 5.3 cents/kWh {{asof|2015|lc=yes}}.&lt;ref name="eia.gov" /&gt;

The steam turbine section of a power plant, the ''turbine hall'', generally costs about $1/W, and the electrical equipment to feed that power to the grid is about another $1/W.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |title= The World Nuclear Supply Chain: Outlook 2035 |url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/workshops/pmnnb/presentations/docs/2.1.pdf |publisher= World Nuclear Association |date=2016 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reach the projected total CAPEX quoted in LIFE documents, this implies that the entire ''nuclear island'' has to cost around $4/W for LIFE.2, and just over $2/W for LIFE.3. Modern nuclear plants, benefiting from decades of commercial experience and continuous design work, cost just under $8/W, with approximately half of that in the nuclear island. LLNL's estimates require LIFE.3 to be built in 2040 for about half the cost of a fission plant today.{{sfn|Lazard|2014|p=13}}

== End of LIFE ==
NIF construction was completed in 2009 and the lab began a long calibration and setup period to bring the laser to its full capacity. The plant reached its design capacity of 1.8&amp;nbsp;MJ of UV light in 2012.{{sfn|Crandall|2012|p=1}}  During this period, NIF began running a staged program known as the National Ignition Campaign, with the goal of reaching ignition by 30 September 2012. Ultimately, the campaign failed as unexpected performance problems arose that had not been predicted in the simulations. By the end of 2012 the system was producing best-case shots that were still {{frac|10}} of the pressures needed to achieve ignition.{{sfn|Crandall|2012|p=3}}

In the years since, NIF has run a small number of experiments with the explicit aim of improving that number, but {{asof|2015|lc=yes}} the best result is still {{frac|3}} away from the required densities, and the method used to achieve those numbers may not be suitable for closing that gap and reaching ignition. It is expected that a number of years of additional work are required before ignition can be achieved, if ever.{{sfn|Crandall|2012|p=2}} During a progress review after the end of the Campaign, a [[National Academy of Sciences]] review board stated that "The appropriate time for the establishment of a national, coordinated, broad-based inertial fusion energy program within DOE is when ignition is achieved."{{sfn|NSF|2013|p=168}} They noted that "the panel assesses that ignition using laser indirect drive is not likely in the next several years."{{sfn|NSF|2013|p=212}}

The LIFE effort was quietly cancelled in early 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Kirk |last=Levedahl|url=http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/07-13-inlinefiles/SSQ%20V3%20N1_Final_11june13.pdf|title=National Ignition Campaign Closure and the Path Forward for Ignition|journal=Stockpile Stewardship Quarterly|date=June 2013|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; LLNL's acting director, Bret Knapp, commented on the issue stating that "The focus of our inertial confinement fusion efforts is on understanding ignition on NIF rather than on the LIFE concept. Until more progress is made on ignition, we will direct our efforts on resolving the remaining fundamental scientific challenges to achieving fusion ignition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kramer |first=David |title=Livermore Ends Life | doi = 10.1063/PT.3.2344|journal=Physics Today |date=April 2014 |pages=26–27 |volume=67|issue=4 |bibcode=2014PhT....67R..26K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lisa A. Marcaurelle''' is a chemist and a senior executive in multiple biotechnology companies.

== Education ==
Marcaurelle received her B.A. in Chemistry from the [[College of the Holy Cross]] in 1997, where she worked with Prof. Timothy Curran on dipeptide scaffolds. She enrolled in [[University of California, Berkeley|UC-Berkeley]] to pursue a Ph.D. in Chemistry under [[Carolyn R. Bertozzi|Carolyn Bertozzi]], working on a variety of new glycoside-linking technologies to produce glycoprotein mimetics for natural substances like [[mucin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcaurelle|first=L. A.|date=2002-06-01|title=Recent advances in the chemicalsynthesis of mucin-like glycoproteins|url=https://academic.oup.com/glycob/article/12/6/69R/719762|journal=Glycobiology|language=en|volume=12|issue=6|pages=69R–77|doi=10.1093/glycob/12.6.69R|issn=1460-2423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcaurelle completed a one-year postdoctoral fellowship at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], working with [[Peter Seeberger]] on solid-phase synthesis of oligosaccharides.

== Career ==
Marcaurelle worked at [[Infinity Pharmaceuticals]] and the [[Broad Institute]] for a combined 9 years, working in high-throughput chemistry, diversity-oriented chemical synthesis, chemical biology, and medicinal chemistry projects. She was recruited as a Vice President at [[H3 Biomedicine]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/lisa-marcaurelle|title=Crunchbase: Lisa Marcaurelle, H3|last=|first=|date=|website=Crunchbase|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At H3, Marcaurelle instituted and continued to develop a [[Divergent synthesis|diversity-oriented synthesis]] platform, based on newly-evolving chemotypes such as [[Spiro compound|spirocycles]] and macrocycles. In 2016, she became Senior Director of Chemistry at Warp Drive Bio, and in 2018 Vice President of Enko Chem, a venture-backed crop protection start-up in the Boston area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enkochem.com/|title=Welcome|website=Enko Chem|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcaurelle remains active in professional society volunteering and mentorship of younger scientists in the pharmaceutical industry, and actively advocates for the inclusion of women scientists in leadership roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html|title=Why can’t the drug industry solve its gender diversity problem?|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7621">[[Image:MediaTechnologyMonitorLogo.jpg|frame|50px|alt=Logo of the Media Technology Monitor (MTM).|Logo ]]The '''Media Technology Monitor''' (MTM) is an annual telephone survey and research product designed to monitor Canadians' use and adoption of new and existing technologies.  The first MTM questionnaire was distributed in 2005 and now consists of two annual surveys conducted in the spring and fall of each year.&lt;ref&gt;CRTC Communications Monitoring Report (2011) - {{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/policymonitoring/2011/cmr2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005120457/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/PolicyMonitoring/2011/cmr2011.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey features questions that focus on current and emerging media activities and technologies such as, television across multiple platforms, radio use social media, and online audio.  The results of the Media Technology Monitor are published through a series of syndicated reports and multiple short, targeted theme reports. The Media Technology Monitor reports are distributed to government agencies, broadcasters, and other media stakeholders across Canada who subscribe to the service.

The MTM is designed, implemented and analyzed by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC/Radio-Canada).&lt;ref&gt;Broadcaster Magazine - http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/bbm-analytics-to-market-cbc-radio-canada-media-technology-monitor/1000045568/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the MTM coordinated with [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa, Ontario to provide learning materials to the Communications Department.

==History==
The Media Technology Monitor has evolved from the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's]] Quality Ratings Survey (QRS) that began in 1997 to measure Canadians' use and perception of Canada's conventional and specialty television channels as well as some media technology behaviours.  In 2005, the MTM was launched with a specific focus on media technology adoption and use among Canadians. In 2010, an online MTM portal ([http://www.mtm-otm.ca www.mtm-otm.ca]) was created to provide a more interactive experience for users.  The portal allows users a quick and easy way to download MTM reports and trending data, as well as conduct custom analysis of the data with a proprietary data analysis tool.

MTM-OTM Video on YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGlObksktTU&amp;feature=youtu.be

Since then the technology has become less and less used due to the rise of the internet and the easier, quicker and cheaper way to send our surveys to users which using certain methods is also further available for free. 

==Survey Methodology and Design==
The Media Technology Monitor is released in the fall and spring of each year and collects a total of 12,000 responses through telephone interviews with 6,000 Anglophones and 6,000 Francophones aged 18+.  The response rate for both surveys is 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Official MTM Website - {{cite web |url=http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329110546/http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |archivedate=2012-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fall Survey - 8,000 Respondents (4,000 Anglophones and 4,000 Francophones)&lt;ref&gt;Official MTM Website - {{cite web |url=http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329110546/http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |archivedate=2012-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spring Survey - 4,000 Respondents (2,000 Anglophones and 2,000 Francophones)&lt;ref&gt;Official MTM Website - {{cite web |url=http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329110546/http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |archivedate=2012-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTM survey households are selected by [[Random digit dialing|Random Digit Dialing]] (RDD) and the respondent within each household is randomly selected based on the most recent birthday method. The MTM uses telephone surveys to ensure that the respondents are representative of all Canadians by eliminating bias due to geographic location and connection to the Internet.

==Current Topics==

The Media Technology Monitor is revised every year to include emerging media trends and technologies.  Recent MTM surveys have asked respondents about their behavior and consumption of:

== Biography ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}Brunet was born in 1940 in [[Vienne]], in the region of [[Poitou]]. After having passed his first years in the countryside, at 8 he moved with his family to [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]. He took a [[Ph.D.]] in [[paleontology]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and then became Professor of [[Vertebrate paleontology]] at the [[University of Poitiers]], specializing in [[hoof]]ed [[mammal]]s.

A turning point in Brunet's career was when he heard that [[paleoanthropologist]] [[David Pilbeam]] was searching for [[fossil]] [[ape]]s in [[Pakistan]] and the ancestors of the [[hominid]]s. This spurred Brunet to form with his colleague Emile Heintz a team with the idea of also searching for extinct apes across the border from Pakistan in [[Afghanistan]]. The expedition was unsuccessful, and no fossil apes were found.

In the 1980s Brunet and Pilbeam matched together and moved to [[Africa]]. Their idea was to verify the theory of [[Yves Coppens]] that hominids had first rose in the [[savanna]]s of Eastern Africa. The two paleontologists idea was that the shores of [[Lake Chad]] were particularly indicated to work as a magnet for mammals, and maybe also hominids. In 1984 searching begun in [[Cameroon]], but the nine field seasons spent there were discouraging, with no hominids found.

A new opportunity presented itself to Brunet when the government of [[Chad]] gave him the permission to conduct researches in the Djurab Desert, that due the [[Civil war in Chad (1965–1979)|Chadian Civil War]] had long been closed to foreigners. Brunet promptly formed the French-Chadian Paleoanthropological Mission (''Mission Paléoanthropologique Franco-Tchadienne'' or MPFT) a Franco-Chadian scientific alliance that united the [[University of Poitiers]], the [[University of N'Djamena]] and the Centre Nationale d'Appui à la Recherche (CNAR).

The area proved itself to be a site rich in fossils, and expeditions headed by Brunet have collected over 8000 of them, including hominid remains. On January 23, 1995 he spotted a jawbone 3.5 million years old, that he classified as a new [[species]] of [[Australopithecine]], the ''[[Australopithecus bahrelghazali]]''. Informally he called it [[Abel (hominid)|Abel]], as a tribute to his dead friend Abel Brillanceau. Abel was the first fossil hominid found in [[Western Africa]], radically transforming the discussions on early hominid distribution, that until this discovery was thought to center only in Southern and especially Eastern Africa.

While much discussed, a yet more important find was to be made by Brunet's team on July 19, 2001; a Chadian student of the mission, Ahounta Djimdoumalbaye, unearthed a nearly complete [[Human cranium|cranium]], from 6 to 7 million years old, nicknamed [[Toumaï]]  by the [[Chadian President]] [[Idriss Déby]], and classified by Brunet as the first exemplary of the ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]''. Brunet and others, like Tim White, are strongly convinced Toumai to be a hominid, though this is contested by colleagues like Milford Wolpoff, who instead believe it to be an ape. Other experts, like Chris Stringer, argued it was inconclusive where the ''Sahelanthropus'' belongs in the human evolutionary line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2313695.stm|title=Scientists clash over skull|date=2002-10-09|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brunet has argued that further excavations have uncovered additional remains which further confirm that Sahelanthropus was a hominid, though his conclusions with these newer findings are also debated by some scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jessica|first=Ebert,|date=2005-04-06|title=Facelift seals standing of oldest hominid|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news050404-6|journal=Nature News|language=en|doi=10.1038/news050404-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery brought Brunet worldwide recognition in the field of [[paleoanthropology]]; and in 2003 he was awarded the [[Dan David Prize]], a prize given to those whose achievements help better understand the world, or affect it.

The '''Minerva Initiative''' is a research program sponsored by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) that provides grants to sustain university-based, social science studies on areas of strategic importance to U.S. national security policy.  The program looks to tap into the community of area specialists and other university researchers, particularly those who work on [[Islam]], [[Iraq]], [[China]], and related areas.&lt;ref&gt;Minerva Initiative, http://minerva.dtic.mil/&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its establishment in 2008, the Department of Defense has awarded over 70 grants to private researchers.&lt;ref&gt;http://minerva.dtic.mil/&lt;/ref&gt;   Grants are awarded on an annual basis for research projects that typically last three years.

In 2011 the DoD hosted the first annual Minerva Conference.  The event has since become an annual gathering in September for Minerva researchers, DoD keynote speakers, and scholars to highlight the most relevant research conducted through the program’s support.

==History==
In 2008, the project was provided $50 million by the United States Department of Defense to fund research on five separate themes.  When the program began in 2008 project funding was split between DoD and the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=112015&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, all projects have been funded solely by the DoD.  The goal was to create improved relations between the Department of Defense and the universities and to develop knowledge that the military can benefit from in the long term.

Secretary of Defense [[Robert M. Gates]] commissioned the Minerva Initiative under the vision of “…a consortia of universities that will promote research in specific areas.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1228&lt;/ref&gt;   Originally, Secretary Gates proposed four principal focus areas:  1) Chinese Military and Technology Studies 2) Iraqi and Terrorist Perspective Projects 3) Religious and Ideological Studies, and 4) New Disciplines Project and 5) Open Category.  Since its establishment, the Minerva Initiative has expanded the breadth of sponsored research to include a wide range of academic disciplines and topics [see Ongoing Research].  The program continues to fund research on the most important social science topics for universities like [[Arizona State University]], which recently received a grant to support research on terrorists’ use of social media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hstoday.us/briefings/industry-news/single-article/arizona-state-university-awarded-minerva-grant-to-research-terrorist-use-of-social-media/8ccb655066e27c7103573a96721f3bae.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The stated goal of the Minerva Initiative “is to improve DoD's basic understanding of the social, cultural, behavioral, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the U.S.”&lt;ref&gt;http://minerva.dtic.mil/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The program seeks to achieve this by sponsoring research designed to bring together universities, research institutions, and individual scholars.  Three key priorities reflect the objectives of the Secretary of Defense for the Minerva Initiative:&lt;blockquote&gt;
“1) Leverage and focus the resources of the Nation's top universities.
 
2) Seek to define and develop foundational knowledge about sources of present and future conflict with an eye toward better understanding of the political trajectories of key regions of the world.
 3) Improve the ability of DoD to develop cutting-edge social science research, foreign area and interdisciplinary studies that is developed and vetted by the best scholars in these fields.”&lt;ref&gt;http://minerva.dtic.mil/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Ongoing Research==
As of 2015 the Minerva Initiative’s priority research areas fall within four categories:&lt;blockquote&gt; 
I.  Identity, Influence, and Mobilization
 
II. Contributors to Societal Resilience and Change

III. Power and Deterrence

IV. Innovations in National Security, Conflict, and Cooperation&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A list of all research awards made since the start of the Minerva Initiative are listed at the program’s site: https://web.archive.org/web/20091212104216/http://minerva.dtic.mil/funded.html.  In 2015, the Minerva Steering Committee received over 300 applications (297 white papers and 46 full proposals).

==Controversy==

The program's funding of social science research for national security purposes has proven controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ssrc.org/essays/minerva/| title=The Minerva Controversy| publisher=Social Science Research Council| accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Although many scholars support Minerva, at the program’s start a number of academic researchers sounded public alarm about the prospect of Defense Department funding for research. In 2008 the [[American Anthropological Association]] sent a public letter suggesting that the funding be transferred to a different body, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF). [[Hugh Gusterson]], a prominent anthropologist at [[George Mason University]], wrote a series of articles in a variety of venues that have attracted significant attention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Gusterson | first=Hugh | authorlink = | title=When Professors Go to War. Why the Ivory Tower and the Pentagon don’t mix | work = | publisher=Foreign Policy | date=July 21, 2008 | url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2008/07/21/when-professors-go-to-war/ | format = | doi = | accessdate=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
"any attempt to centralize thinking about culture and terrorism under [[the Pentagon]]’s roof will inevitably produce an intellectually shrunken outcome....The Pentagon will have the false comfort of believing that it has harnessed the best and the brightest minds, when in fact it will have only received a very limited slice of what the ivory tower has to offer—academics who have no problem taking Pentagon funds. Social scientists call this “selection bias,” and it can lead to dangerous analytical errors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Gusterson | first=Hugh | authorlink = | title=When Professors Go to War.

The journalist [[Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed|Nafeez Ahmed]] has expressed concern that Minerva research, in its effort to understand mass mobilization, may be targeting peaceful activists, NGOs and protest movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahmed|first=Nafeez| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/jun/12/pentagon-mass-civil-breakdown|title=Pentagon preparing for mass civil breakdown| publisher=The Guardian|date=June 12, 2014|accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe social science should continue to emphasize security issues but worry that DoD funding will bias findings. One article notes:&lt;blockquote&gt;

"In an incentive structure that rewards an emphasis on countering global threats and securing the homeland, the devil lies in the definitions. In this framework, the [[Boston Marathon bombing]] becomes a national security problem, whereas the [[Sandy Hook massacre]] remains a matter for the police and psychologists—a distinction that is both absurd as social science and troubling as public policy."&lt;ref&gt;Charles King. “The Decline of International Studies: Why Flying Blind Is Dangerous.” Foreign Affairs, July/August 2015 issue. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-06-16/decline-international-studies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Multi Autonomous Ground-robotic International Challenge (MAGIC)''' is a 1.6 million dollar prize competition for autonomous [[mobile robots]] funded by [[United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center|TARDEC]] and the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation|DSTO]], the primary research organizations for Tank and Defense research in the United States and Australia respectively. The goal of the competition is to create multi-vehicle robotic teams that can execute an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission in a dynamic urban environment. The challenge required competitors to map a 500&amp;nbsp;m x 500&amp;nbsp;m challenge area in under 3.5 hours  and to correctly locate, classify and recognise all simulated threats. The challenge event was conducted in [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]], during {{nowrap|November 2010}}.

==Competitors==
Initially 12 teams were selected for the competition in {{nowrap|November 2009}}, of which 10 teams received funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drdobbs.com/article/print?articleID=221400276&amp;dept_url=/security/ ''Dr Dobb's Journal''&amp;nbsp;– Teams From U.S., Australia Among Finalists In Worldwide Robotics Competition]&lt;/ref&gt; These included:
* MAGICian – Adelaide/Perth, Australia ([[University of Western Australia|UWA]], [[Edith Cowan University|ECU]], [[Flinders University|Flinders]], [[Thales Australia|Thales]])
* Strategic Engineering – Adelaide, Australia ([[University of Adelaide|U. Adelaide]])
* Northern Hunters – Canada ([[Royal Military College of Canada]])
* Chiba Team – Japan ([[Chiba University]])
* Cappadocia – Ankara, Turkey ([[ASELSAN]], [[Ohio State University]])
* RASR – Gaithersburg, Md. (Robotics Research, LLC; [[QinetiQ]]; [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]])
* Team Cornell – US ([[Cornell University]])
* Team Michigan – Ann Arbor, Mich. ([[University of Michigan]])
* Virginia Tech – US ([[Virginia Tech]])
* University of Pennsylvania – Philadelphia ([[University of Pennsylvania]])
* Numinence – Brisbane, Australia (Numinence Pty Ltd, [[LaTrobe University]])
* UNSW – Sydney, Australia ([[University of New South Wales|UNSW]])

The first downselection trial required teams to map an indoor area and outdoor area, and to demonstrate distributing and handing over tasks between robots. During the first downselection trial, the top six teams were selected:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

* Cappadocia – Ankara, Turkey
* MAGICian – Adelaide/Perth, Australia
* RASR – Gaithersburg, Md.
* Team Michigan – Ann Arbor, Mich.
* University of Pennsylvania – Philadelphia
* Chiba Team – Japan

Before the finals were held, Chiba Team withdrew from the competition, leaving five competitors.

==Event==
Ultimately the overall goal of fully autonomous operations without human intervention was not achieved, however, the Secretary for Defence stated "The competing vehicles demonstrated new advances in robotics technology, which are very promising for their potential deployment in combat zones where they can replace our troops in carrying out life-threatening tasks" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission accomplished, robots await verdict|author=Australia Defence Media Centre|date=2010-11-12|url=
http://www.shephard.co.uk/news/uvonline/mission-accomplished-robots-await-verdict/7686/|publisher=[[Shephard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considered the competition a success.

==Results==
The official results of the competition were:
* First – Team Michigan ($750,000 prize)
* Second – University of Pennsylvania ($250,000 prize)
* Third – RASR ($100,000 prize)
* Fourth – MAGICian &amp; Cappadocia

The "Old Ram Shed Challenge" was a single-day competition held after the completion of MAGIC. It was smaller in scale, allowing all of the teams to demonstrate their systems during a single day. The University of Pennsylvania won this challenge, having found a greater number of the target objects than the other teams.

==Technology==
Key technology used by all teams was [[computer vision]], [[sensor fusion]], [[human-robot interaction]],
and [[simultaneous localization and mapping]] (SLAM).

* Team Michigan, a collaboration between the University of Michigan's APRIL Lab and Soar Technology, Inc., had the largest fleet of 14 robots, developed their own [[Inertial Measurement Unit]], and created their [[skid steer]] robot chassis out of Baltic birch plywood. Additionally, they had minimal reliance on [[GPS]] and used bandwidth limited 900&amp;nbsp;MHz radios for all [[telemetry]], imaging, and status communications between all robots and the ground station.  The code was written primarily in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and each robot was equipped with an actuated 2D [[LIDAR]], along with a unique 2D [[barcode]] for inter-robot recognition.
* The University of Pennsylvania team consisted of only four members. All code was written using [[Matlab]]. The robots were equipped with omnidirectional vision.
* RASR used the [[Foster-Miller TALON]] vehicle.
* MAGICian used the WAMbot robots developed by The University of Western Australia, Edith Cowan University and Thales Australia. Code was written in [[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. The robots were equipped with [[SICK AG|SICK]] laser scanners.

'''''Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology and Human Nature''''' is a 1984 book by the evolutionary geneticist [[Richard Lewontin]], the neurobiologist [[Steven Rose]], and the psychologist [[Leon Kamin]], in which the authors criticize [[sociobiology]] and [[genetic determinism]] and advocate a socialist society.

The book formed part of a larger campaign against sociobiology. Its authors were praised for their criticism of IQ testing, and were complimented by some for their critique of sociobiology. However, they have been criticized for misrepresenting the views of scientists such as the biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] and the ethologist [[Richard Dawkins]], for using "determinism" and "reductionism" simply as terms of abuse, and for the influence of [[Marxism]] on their views. Critics have seen its authors' conclusions as political rather than scientific.

==Summary==
Lewontin, Rose and Kamin identify themselves as "respectively an evolutionary geneticist, a neurobiologist, and a psychologist." They criticize biological determinism and reductionism, and state that they share a commitment to the creation of a socialist society and a recognition that "a critical science is an integral part of the struggle to create that society". Their understanding of science draws on ideas suggested by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] and developed by Marxist scholars in the 1930s. They also draw on the ideas of the Marxist philosopher [[György Lukács]], as put forward in ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923), as well as the ideas of the Marxist philosopher [[Ágnes Heller]] and the communist revolutionary [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfn|Lewontin|Rose|Kamin|1990|pages=x–ix, 32, 76, 296}} They discuss and criticize the views of authors such as E. O. Wilson, Richard Dawkins, and [[Donald Symons]]. They criticize Wilson's ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' (1975). They maintain that, like some other sociobiologists, Symons maintains that "the manifest trait is not itself coded by genes, but that a potential is coded and the trait only arises when the appropriate environmental cue is given." In their view, "Despite its superficial appearance of dependence on environment, this model is completely genetically determined, independent of the environment." They write that Symons' arguments in ''[[The Evolution of Human Sexuality]]'' (1979) provide examples "of how sociobiological theory can explain anything, no matter how contradictory, by a little mental gymnastics".{{sfn|Lewontin|Rose|Kamin|1990|pages=9, 74–75, 253, 259–260, 262}}

==Publication history==
''Not in Our Genes'' was first published by [[Pantheon Books]] in 1984. Later that year it was published by [[Pelican Books]]. In 1990, it was published by [[Penguin Books]].{{sfn|Lewontin|Rose|Kamin|1990|page=iv}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''Not in Our Genes'' received positive reviews from the columnist [[Gene Lyons]] in ''[[Newsweek]]'' and the paleontologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'',{{sfn|Lyons|1984|page=84}}{{sfn|Gould|1984|pages=30–32}} a mixed review from the philosopher [[Philip Kitcher]] in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'',{{sfn|Kitcher|1984|page=9}} and negative reviews from the anthropologist [[Melvin Konner]] in ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine and the biologist [[Patrick Bateson]] and the ethologist [[Richard Dawkins]] in ''[[New Scientist]]''.{{sfn|Konner|1984|pages=66–68}}{{sfn|Bateson|1985|pages=58–59}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1985|pages=59–60}}{{sfn|Segerstråle|2000|page=192}} Its editors noted that the book would "inevitably attract either extreme criticism or glowing praise" depending on the reviewer's stance on sociobiology, and that they published two reviews to help encourage debate, having approached Dawkins "for the opposition" and Bateson, "who feels that the attack on genetic determinism is justified."{{sfn|''New Scientist''|1985|page=58}} The book was also reviewed by the psychologist [[Sandra Scarr]] in ''[[American Scientist]]'',{{sfn|Scarr|1984|pages=501–502}} Nathaniel S. Lehrman in ''[[The Humanist (magazine)|The Humanist]]'',{{sfn|Lehrman|1984|pages=39–40}} and in ''[[The Wilson Quarterly]]'' and ''[[Science News]]''.{{sfn|''The Wilson Quarterly''|1984|page=152}}{{sfn|''Science News''|1985|page=179}}

Lyons described the book as a "spirited, if often repetitive, demolition of sociobiology's pretensions", adding that its authors' arguments were "made doubly impressive" by their "analysis of how the economic determinism of what they call '“vulgar” Marxism' and the spinelessness of 'sociological relativism' have contributed to a climate in which the speculations of sociobiology have found a hearing."{{sfn|Lyons|1984|page=84}} Gould described the book as "important and timely". He credited Lewontin ''et al.'' with exposing the fallacies of biological determinism (though he noted that theirs was only one critique among many), and presenting a view of human behavior that went beyond the controversy over nature and nurture. However, he believed that while they exposed problems with research on schizophrenia, they did not reveal "fatal and debilitating flaws". He agreed with Lewontin ''et al.'' that "interactionism is also based on deep fallacies and cultural biases that play into the hands of biological determinism", showing that it is guilty of the fallacy of "reductionism".{{sfn|Gould|1984|pages=30–32}}

Kitcher described the book as "informative, entertaining, lucid, forceful, frequently witty, occasionally unfair, sometimes intemperate, never dull". He  praised Lewontin ''et al.''′s discussion of intelligence, and complimented their discussions of sex differences and the use of drugs and surgery to modify behavior. He was less convinced by their discussion of schizophrenia, writing that in it their "policy of treating their opponents as patsies begins to seem unjustified".{{sfn|Kitcher|1984|page=9}} Konner believed that the book's authors provided an "acceptable review of the dismal historical record of abuse of ideas in behavioral genetics" but that this history had received better discussions. He criticized Lewontin ''et al.'' for giving little attention to "similar abuses that have occurred under political systems that espouse a cultural-determinist ideology." He accused them of falsely attributing a belief in "heredity privilege" to advocates of IQ testing, employing tactics such as guilt through association, providing misleading discussions of issues in psychiatry and neurology, such as attention deficit disorder, psychosurgery, and antipsychotic drugs, and criticizing sociobiology on the basis of the weakest studies in the field and popular writings by journalists. He considered Wilon's discussion of the development of behavior in ''Sociobiology'' more sophisticated than that of Lewontin ''et al.'' He called the book "unfortunate", writing that its authors "offer little, except for pious hand-wringing and 'dialectical' rhetoric, that might help us to grapple with the great unanswered questions of our behavior and experience, normal and abnormal."{{sfn|Konner|1984|pages=66–68}}

Bateson accused the book's authors of making it easy for themselves to criticize the genetic analysis of behavior by focusing on its weakest advocates, though he granted that their "counter-rhetoric" was "brilliant" and sometimes "illuminating." He also praised their discussion of measuring intelligence, writing that it was clear and "merciless" in its "exposure of poor method." He credited them with making a strong case against genetic explanations of both differences in IQ and schizophrenia, but did not consider their conclusions about either issue definitive, noting that both remained subject to dispute. He also found their criticism of ethology and sociobiology distorted by their personal biases, writing that despite errors by some proponents of sociobiology, Lewontin ''et al.'' were incorrect to dismiss it altogether. He noted that they ignored developments in the field that corrected some of the initial mistakes made by Wilson in ''Sociobiology''. He also wrote that their claim that the belief that animals have a tendency not to mate with individuals familiar from early life is based on little evidence is incorrect. According to Bateson, even though he was predisposed to be sympathetic to Lewontin ''et al.''′s approach, the value of their work was undermined by their poor scholarship and bad arguments, and the errors they made in discussing his field forced him to wonder about the value of their work even when it seemed strong, such as the portions concerning IQ and schizophrenia. Though agreeing with their views about the interaction between the social and physical environment, he accused them of wrongly suggesting that they were novel, when they were held by many others and it was doubtful whether anyone actually believed in the form of interactionism they criticized. He predicted that most scientists would simply disregard their book, and questioned whether discrediting genetic determinism would help create a more just society.{{sfn|Bateson|1985|pages=58–59}}

Dawkins accused the book's authors of promoting a "bizarre conspiracy theory of science" that suggested that sociobiology was a response to 1960s student activism, and of wrongly using quotations from non-sociobiologists such as the Conservative politician [[Patrick Jenkin, Baron Jenkin of Roding|Patrick Jenkin]] and representatives of the British [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] and the French [[Nouvelle Droite]] as though they represented sociobiology. He described their claim that sociobiologists believe in genetic determinism as a "simple lie", and wrote that they employed the term "biological determinism" without having a clear idea of what they meant by it, and used the words "determinist" and "reductionist" simply as terms of abuse. He argued that biologists practice an appropriate form of "reductionism" that involves explaining complex wholes in terms of their parts, and never practice the form of "reductionism" criticized by Lewontin ''et al.'', which involves the idea that "the properties of a complex whole are simply the ''sum'' of those same properties in the parts". He maintained that the anthropologists [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Sherwood Washburn]], praised by Lewontin ''et al.'' for their criticism of sociobiology, were both guilty of elementary misunderstandings of [[kin selection]] theory and that Lewontin knew enough about genetics that he should have realized this, and that the "dialectical biology" advocated by Lewontin ''et al.'' actually involved ideas similar to those suggested by Bateson and Dawkins himself. He attributed the positive reviews of the book from liberals to its authors' opposition to racism. Though he believed that its chapters on "IQ testing and similar topics" had some value, he nevertheless concluded that Lewontin ''et al.''′s book was both poorly written and "silly, pretentious, obscurantist and mendacious".{{sfn|Dawkins|1985|pages=59–60}}

===Scientific and academic journals===
''Not in Our Genes'' received positive reviews from the biologist [[Peter Medawar]] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'',{{sfn|Medawar|1984|pages=255–256}} the geneticist [[Alan Emery]] in ''Trends in Neurosciences'',{{sfn|Emery|1985|page=176}} and T. Benton in ''[[The Sociological Review]]'',{{sfn|Benton|1985|pages=571–576}} the biologist [[Franz M. Wuketits]] in the ''Journal of Social and Biological Structures'',{{sfn|Wuketits|1985|pages=391–392}} and a mixed review from the anthropologist [[Vernon Reynolds]] in ''[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]''.{{sfn|Reynolds|1985|pages=310–311}} The book was also reviewed by Howard L. Kaye in ''[[Society (journal)|Society]]''.{{sfn|Kaye|1985|pages=101–102}}

Medawar described the book as a well-written and "in the main convincing rebuttal of a variety of determinist ideologies that have come to acquire the status of a public nuisance in biology and sociology." He endorsed its authors' criticism of IQ testing and their argument that determinism is an expression of conservative ideology. However, he was less satisfied by their criticism of reductionism, writing that despite its shortcomings reductive analysis was "the most successful research stratagem ever devised in science." He argued that it was also the way of understanding the world that made it easiest to see how it could be changed, something left-wing writers such as the authors of ''Not in Our Genes'' should appreciate.{{sfn|Medawar|1984|pages=255–256}} Emery welcomed the book as a refreshing attempt to create a more balanced view of the relevance of genetics to human behavior.{{sfn|Emery|1985|page=176}}

Benton described the book as an "immense achievement" and a well-written work accessible to a large audience. He complimented its authors for their historical survey of biological determinism and reductionism and their philosophical discussion of their dialectical alternative, and praised their discussions of IQ testing, biological determinist defences of [[patriarchy]], psychiatry, schizophrenia, and sociobiology. He believed that they exposed the logical and conceptual problems of defining and measuring intelligence and identifying schizophrenia as a unitary disorder, as well as problems in the methodologies of heritability studies in both cases, including their assumption that "the determinants of any characteristic can be analysed as of two, separable kinds, heredity and environment, and that it makes sense to ask what proportion of each went into the making of the particular characteristic." He wrote that they dealt "selectively (and probably appropriately) with the work of Wilson and Dawkins". However, he believed that they did not have a fully developed alternative to biological and cultural determinism, questioned whether they were able to present a view different from cultural determinism, and noted that while they treated sociobiology as a form of genetic determinism, the main sociobiological writers had become "more sophisticated and qualified in their assumptions." He criticized them for using quotations in a selective fashion to argue that sociobiology is still an unqualified form of genetic determinism, and for equating "biological determinism and political reaction", noting that religious fundamentalists wanted to outlaw the teaching of evolutionary theory, and some progressive thinkers accept that biological processes shape personality.{{sfn|Benton|1985|pages=571–576}}

Wuketits described the book as "concise and well written", and "more provocative than anything else written in opposition to genetic determinism and its ideological interpretation" because of its identification of sociobiology with the [[New Right]]. Although he agreed with many of Lewontin ''et al.''′s views, he nevertheless considered them mistaken to view sociobiology as only an "ideological program", writing that it was primarily a scientific discipline and should not be dismissed simply for ideological reasons. He expressed regret that the book would give readers not familiar with the scientific background to sociobiology the impression that it is "nothing but a dangerous pseudoscientific ideology."{{sfn|Wuketits|1985|pages=391–392}}

Reynolds argued that because Lewontin ''et al.'' dismissed biological approaches to understanding human nature, they invalidated their own claims about human nature, reducing them from scientific to political statements. He maintained, in opposition to Lewontin ''et al.'', that a single "committed political position" cannot be used to evaluate or criticize science, and that determining to what extent scientific claims are actually political in nature requires consideration of all political positions. He wrote that Lewontin ''et al.'' provided a dubious description of science that made it sound like a "right wing political movement", noting that their own credentials as scientists suggested that their politicized view of science was incorrect. However, he considered them correct to claim that the arguments of sociobiology were only "speculative suggestions" and that it was unfortunate if "the fascist right" adopted them as "scientific validation of its ideology", and that some scientific work, such as "IQ testing", is politicized science, and credited them with showing that "a good many branches of the science of human nature all revolve around the problem of inequality" and "mostly validate it." He also found their book enjoyable reading.{{sfn|Reynolds|1985|pages=310–311}}

===Evaluations in books===
The psychologist [[David P. Barash]], writing in ''The Hare and the Tortoise'' (1986), mentioned ''Not in Our Genes'' as an example of the controversy surrounding sociobiology. He criticized Lewontin ''et al.'' for unfairly connecting sociobiology with "racist [[eugenics]] and misguided [[Social Darwinism]]."{{sfn|Barash|1988|page=329}} Dawkins, writing in the second edition of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976; second edition 1989), accused Lewontin ''et al.'' of misquoting his comment of genes, "they created us, body and mind", by altering the word "created" to "control", and maintained that genes do not control people in the way that "genetic determinism" suggests. He accused Lewontin ''et al.'' of failing to understand that "it is perfectly possible to hold that genes exert a statistical influence on human behavior while at the same time believing that this influence can be modified, overriden or reversed by other influences."{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|pages=271, 331}} The biologist [[Dean Hamer]], writing in ''[[The Science of Desire]]'' (1994), described ''Not in Our Genes'' as "a political rather than a scientific book" and expressed his disagreement with its politics. Nevertheless, Hamer commented that it taught him that the genetics of behavior is an emotionally and politically charged topic, especially where it concerns sexuality, and helped motivate him to change fields from [[metallothionein]] research to the genetics of [[homosexuality]].{{sfn|Hamer|Copeland|1994|pages=25–26}} The philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], writing in ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'' (1995), criticized Lewontin ''et al.''′s account of reductionism, calling it "idiosyncratic". He also criticized their claim that [[meme]]s involve a Cartesian view of the mind, arguing that memes are "a key (central but optional) ingredient in the best alternatives to Cartesian models".{{sfn|Dennett|1995|pages=81, 368}} [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]], writing in ''[[Why Freud Was Wrong]]'' (1995), called ''Not in Our Genes'', "a critique of sociobiology and genetic determinism which is, for the most part, much more subtle and valuable than the Marxism which frequently informs it."{{sfn|Webster|2005|page=611}}

Rose, writing in ''Lifelines'' (1997), commented that he and his co-authors in ''Not in Our Genes'' presented a critique of reductionism that was "systematic and based upon a coherent philosophical and political analysis which sees modern science as the inheritor of nineteenth-century mechanical materialism, itself tightly linked ideologically to a particular phase of the development of industrial capitalism."{{sfn|Rose|1997|page=73}} The historian of science Roger Smith, writing in ''The Norton History of the Human Sciences'' (1997), described ''Not in Our Genes'' as an accessible critique of sociobiology.{{sfn|Smith|1997|page=1006}} The psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], writing in ''[[How the Mind Works]]'' (1997), criticized Lewontin ''et al.'' for engaging in "innuendos about Donald Symons's sex life" and misquoting Dawkins.{{sfn|Pinker|1997|page=45}} The sociologist [[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]], writing with Steven Rose in ''Alas, Poor Darwin'' (2000), noted that ''Not in Our Genes'' was one of a number of books that criticized sociobiology.{{sfn|Rose|Rose|2000|pages=6–7}} In the same work, Hilary Rose suggested that ''Not in Our Genes'' had been misread by critics, and credited its authors with offering "an alternative theory to biological determinism more robust than the rather weak concept of interaction between nature and nurture".{{sfn|Rose|2000|page=124}}

The sociologist Ullica Segerstråle, writing in ''Defenders of the Truth: The Battle for Science in the Sociobiology Debate and Beyond'' (2000), suggested that ''Not in Our Genes'', along with Gould's anti-sociobiological essays in ''Natural History'' magazine, represented the height of the "critical attack" on sociobiology from its opponents. She noted that the book constituted a late admission from critics of sociobiology that some of them wanted a socialist society. According to Segerstråle, Rose threatened to sue Dawkins for libel for his review of the book, and although he did not make good on the threat, the evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]] and other scientists made efforts to protect Dawkins, including seeking help from Segerstråle herself. She suggested that Rose's reaction to Dawkins's review may been influenced by the fact that while ''New Scientist'', which commissioned reviews from Dawkins and Bateson, had expected the former to write a negative and the latter a positive review, both reviews were in fact negative, which may have disappointed Rose, a friend of Bateson. She also noted that the book's attack on sociobiology led Dawkins to identify himself as a sociobiologist for the first time.{{sfn|Segerstråle|2000|pages=99, 177, 191–192, 299}}

The behavioral ecologist [[John Alcock (behavioral ecologist)|John Alcock]], writing in ''The Triumph of Sociobiology'' (2001), argued that while Lewontin ''et al.'' were correct to maintain that no genes for social behavior had been identified as of 1984, it was nevertheless clear that thousands of genes are expressed in human brain cells and must be relevant to the structure of the brain and to human behavior.{{sfn|Alcock|2001|pages=52–53}} Pinker, writing in ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' (2002), accused Lewontin ''et al.'' of using words such as "determinism" and "reductionism" as "vague terms of abuse", and of misrepresenting the views of scientists such as Wilson and Dawkins, falsely ascribing ridiculous beliefs to them. He saw them and other critics of "determinism" as misusing the term by using it to refer to the idea that people simply have a tendency to behave in a certain fashion. Pinker endorsed Dawkins's review of ''Not in Our Genes''. He noted that Lewontin and Rose were themselves both "reductionist biologists", and attributed their rejection of the idea of human nature to their acceptance of Marxism.{{sfn|Pinker|2003|pages=112–113, 127}}

Dennett, writing in ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'' (2003), accused Lewontin ''et al.'' of being willing to use unscrupulous tactics to criticize people they considered determinists.{{sfn|Dennett|2003|page=19}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7786">Free acidity is an important parameter that defines the quality of [[olive oil]] and is defined as a percentage as grams of free [[fatty acids]] (expressed as [[oleic acid]], the main fatty acid present in olive oil) in 100 grams of oil. As defined by the [[European Commission]] regulation No. 2568/91 and subsequent amendments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91 on the characteristics of olive oil and olive-residue oil and on the relevant methods of analysis|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regcomitology/index.cfm?do=Search.getPDF&amp;3VvDpTVDqho6ypqs+iQioqDbby3gYP7DoFPCzj0pZY65SVAw47eF02NzJJLXFBE77kGvLzo2Pu5uyjPyPE0HGhn1Yyu8a5hceFqN5ixnqYI=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest quality olive oil (Extra-Virgin olive oil) must feature a free acidity lower than 0.8%. Virgin olive oil is characterized by acidity between 0.8% and 2%, while lampante olive oil (a low quality oil that is not edible) features a free acidity higher than 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grossi|first1=Marco|last2=Di Lecce|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Gallina Toschi|first3=Tullia|last4=Riccò|first4=Bruno|title=Fast and accurate determination of olive oil acidity by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy|journal=IEEE Sensors Journal|date=2014|volume=14|issue=9|pages=2947–2954|doi=10.1109/JSEN.2014.2321323|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6809165/?arnumber=6809165&amp;tag=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase of free acidity in [[olive oil]] is due to free [[fatty acids]] that are released from [[triglyceride]]s.

== Mechanisms of free fatty acids formation ==
The presence of free [[fatty acids]] in [[olive oil]] is caused by a reaction ([[lipolysis]]) started when lipolytic enzymes (that are normally present in the pulp and seed cells of the [[olive]]) come in contact with the oil (that is contained in particular [[vacuole]]s) due to loss of integrity of the olive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peri|first1=Claudio|title=The Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Handbook|date=2014|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-118-46045-0|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118460456.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; High values of free acidity in [[olive oil]] can be due different factors such as: production from unhealthy olives (due to [[microorganism]]s and [[mould]]s contamination or attacked by flies and [[parasite]]s), bruised olives, delayed [[harvesting]] and storage before processing.  The [[lipolysis]] reaction is greatly enhanced by the presence of an aqueous phase, so when oil is separated from [[water]] during processing, [[lipolysis]] slows down and stops.

== Methods to measure olive oil free acidity ==
Free acidity is a defect of [[olive oil]] that is tasteless and odorless, thus can not be detected by [[sensory analysis]]. Since [[vegetable oils]] are not aqueous fluids, a [[pH-meter]] can not be used for this measure. Various approaches exist that can measure oil acidity with good [[accuracy]].

=== Manual titration===
The official technique to measure free acidity in [[olive oil]] (as defined by the [[European Commission]] regulation No. 2568/91) is a manual [[titration]] procedure: a known volume of the oil to be tested is added to a mix of [[ether]], [[methanol]] and [[phenolphthalein]], known volumes of [[potassium hydroxide]] KOH 0.1M (the titrant) are added until there is a change in the color of the solution. The total volume of added titrant is then used to estimate the free acidity. The official technique for acidity measure in [[olive oil]] is accurate and reliable, but is essentially a laboratory method that must be carried out by trained personnel (mainly because of the toxic compounds used). Hence it is not suitable for ''in situ'' measurements in small [[oil mill]]s.

=== Near-infrared spectroscopy===
One of the most promising method is based on optical [[near-infrared spectroscopy]] (NIR) where the optical [[absorbance]], i.e. the fraction of intensity of the incident light that is absorbed by the oil sample, is used to estimate the oil acidity. An oil sample is placed in a [[cuvette]] and analyzed by a [[spectrophotometer]] on a wide range of [[wavelength]]s. The results (i.e. the absorbance data for every tested wavelength) are thus processed by a statistical algorithm, such as [[Principal Component Analysis]] (PCA) or [[partial least squares regression|Partial Least Squares regression]] (PLS), to estimate the oil acidity. The  feasibility to measure [[olive oil]] free acidity and [[peroxide value]] by NIR spectroscopy in the wavenumber range 4,541 to 11,726&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armenta|first1=S.|last2=Garrigues|first2=S.|last3=De la Guardia|first3=M.|title=Determination of edible oil parameters by near infrared spectrometry|journal=Analytica Chimica Acta|date=2007|volume=596|issue=2|pages=330–337|doi=10.1016/j.aca.2007.06.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many commercial [[spectrophotometer]]s exist &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.claudiovignoli.com/nir-olive-analyzer-t-38-mini/|title=NIR Olive Analyzer T-38 Mini|website=www.claudiovignoli.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be used for analysis of different quality parameters in olive oil.  The main advantage of NIR [[spectroscopy]] is the possibility to carry out the analysis on raw olive oil samples, without any chemical pretreatment. The main drawbacks are the high cost of commercial [[spectrophotometer]] and the need of [[calibration]] for different types of oil (produced by olives of different varieties, different geographical origin, etc.).

[[File:Pensacola Bay Bridge Ice.jpg|thumb|Ice and snow as seen from an [[Florida Department of Transportation|FDOT]] camera on the [[Pensacola Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] in far northern Florida, following a winter storm on 28–29 January 2014. Much of the Panhandle experienced significant ice buildup (from freezing rain and sleet) followed by a light snowfall.]]
It is very rare for [[snow]] to fall in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]], especially in the central and southern portions of the state. With the exception of the far northern areas of the state and the [[Jacksonville]] area, most of the major cities in Florida have never recorded measurable snowfall, only trace (T) amounts have been recorded, or flurries observed in the air a few times each century. According to the [[National Weather Service]], in the [[Florida Keys]] and [[Key West]] there is no known occurrence of snow flurries since the settlement of the region. In the [[Miami]], [[Ft. Lauderdale]], and [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] areas, as well as the [[Tampa]] area, there is only one known report of snow flurries observed in the air (and in some areas a trace on the ground) in January 1977.  

Due to Florida's low latitude and subtropical climate, temperatures cold enough to support significant snowfall are infrequent and their duration is fleeting. In general, [[frost]] is more common than snow, requiring temperatures of 32[[Fahrenheit|&amp;nbsp;°F]] (0[[Celsius|&amp;nbsp;°C]]) or less at {{convert|2|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} above sea level, a cloudless sky, and a [[relative humidity]] of 65% or more.&lt;ref name="jack"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Davis, T. Frederick|year=1908|title=Climatology of Jacksonville, Fla. and vicinity|journal=Monthly Weather Review|publisher=United States Weather Bureau|volume=35|issue=12|pages=566–572|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1907)35&lt;566:COJFAV&gt;2.0.CO;2|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/035/mwr-035-12-0566.pdf|accessdate=June 15, 2013|bibcode = 1907MWRv...35..566D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, for snow to occur, the polar [[jet stream]] must move southward through [[Texas]] and into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], with a stalled [[cold front]] across the southern portion of the state curving northeastward to combine freezing air into the frontal clouds.&lt;ref name="snowon"&gt;{{cite news|author=Winterling, George|date=December 4, 2003|title=Snow on the First Coast|publisher=News4JAX.com|accessdate=January 22, 2007|url=http://www.news4jax.com/weather/2683348/detail.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612010847/http://www.news4jax.com/weather/2683348/detail.html|archivedate=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While light snowfall occurs a few times each decade across the northern [[Florida Panhandle|panhandle]], most of the state is too far south of the cold continental air masses responsible for generating snowfall in the rest of the country. The mean maximum monthly snowfall in most parts of Florida is zero. The only other areas in the continental United States with this distinction are extreme southern Texas (around [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]]) and parts of coastal southern [[California]] at low elevations.&lt;ref name="johnharrington AMS"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Harrington Jr., John A.|author2=Cerveny, Randall S.|author3=Dewey, Kenneth F.|title=A Climatology of Mean Monthly Snowfall for the Conterminous United States: Temporal and Spatial Patterns|journal=Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology|date=August 1987|volume= 26|issue=8|publisher=American Meteorological Society|issn=0733-3021|pages=897–912|doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1987)026&lt;0897:ACOMMS&gt;2.0.CO;2|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0450%281987%29026%3C0897%3AACOMMS%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=June 15, 2013|bibcode=1987JApMe..26..897H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the known information on snow in Florida prior to 1900 is from [[climatology|climatological]] records provided by the [[National Weather Service]] meteorological station in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], and information for other locations is sparse. The earliest recorded instance of snow in Florida occurred in 1774; being unaccustomed to snow, some Jacksonville residents called it "extraordinary white rain."&lt;ref name="jack"/&gt; The first [[White Christmas (weather)|White Christmas]] in northeastern Florida's history resulted from a snow event that occurred on December 23, 1989.&lt;ref name="Event Review"&gt;{{Cite report |author=Collins, Chris |year=1989 |title=December 23-24, 1989 Christmas Snowstorm |type=Event Summaries/Case Review |publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service Forecast Office Newport/Morehead City North Carolina |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/mhx/EventReviews/19891223/19891223.php |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HOdyyBvG?url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/mhx/EventReviews/19891223/19891223.php |archivedate=June 15, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Tim|title=Christmas Coastal Snowstorm: December 22-24, 1989|url=http://www.weather.gov/ilm/ChristmasSnow1989|publisher=National Weather Service Wilmington|accessdate=7 January 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113182815/http://www.weather.gov/ilm/ChristmasSnow1989|archivedate=November 13, 2016|date=December 7, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scanlan|first1=Dan|title=Lots of memories as Jacksonville marks the silver anniversary of 1989's freak snowstorm|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2014-12-22/story/lots-memories-jacksonville-remembers-snow-1989s-silver-anniversary|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=Florida Times-Union|date=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The vast majority of snow events in Florida occurred in far northern Florida and the [[Jacksonville]] area. According to the [[National Weather Service]], the record snowfall for the city of Jacksonville is 1.9 inches (4.8 cm), which fell on February 12, 1899. [[Tampa]] has a record snowfall of 0.2 inches (5.08 mm) which occurred on January 18, 1977.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Due to larger populations and more advanced communication networks, snow events are witnessed and reported much more frequently in recent years than in historical eras. Interpretations of this timeline must therefore be made with caution, as observed patterns may not reflect actual climate-related trends in annual snowfall but rather improved reporting. Additionally, the presence of [[Hard rime|rime]] or [[Ice pellets|sleet]] being mistaken for [[snowflakes]] should also be considered. Finally, many of the reports below or not "official" National Weather Service reports, many being compiled by the newspapers and media, personal observations, and stories passed down through the years.

'''''Straight Up: America's Fiercest Climate Blogger Takes on the Status Quo Media, Politicians, and Clean Energy Solutions''''' is a book by author, blogger, physicist&lt;ref&gt;Begley, Sharon.

Romm writes and edits the climate blog [http://www.climateprogress.org ClimateProgress.org] for the [[Center for American Progress]], where he is a Senior Fellow.  [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] named this blog one of the "Top 15 Green Websites"&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1730759_1731034_1731042,00.html Time.com feature on "Top 15 Green Websites"].&lt;/ref&gt; and called Romm "The Web's most influential climate-change blogger", naming him as one of its "[[Heroes of the Environment (2009)]]".&lt;ref name=Hero&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/0,28757,1924149,00.html "Heroes of the Environment 2009"].

Similarly, in 2009, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named Romm to its list of "100 People Who Are Changing America" because of the blog and Romm's other climate advocacy.  See [https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/26754176/the_rs_100_agents_of_change "The 100 People Who Are Changing America",] ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, March 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''Straight Up'' was released on April 19, 2010 by [[Island Press]].  It is "largely a selection of [Romm]'s best blog postings over the past few years related to climate change issues".&lt;ref name=Hamilton&gt;Hamilton, Tyler. [http://theenergycollective.com/TheEnergyCollective/62978 "Wente continues to mislead, misinform Canadian public"]. ''TheEnergyCollective.com'', April 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[TreeHugger]]'' describes the book as "a whirlwind tour through the state of climate change, the media that so badly neglects it, the politicians who attempt to address it (and those who obstruct their efforts and ignore [the] science), and the clean energy solutions that could help get us out of the mess."&lt;ref name=Merchant&gt;Merchant, Brian. [http://www.treehugger.com/files/2010/04/straight-up-tackles-climate-blog-era-book-review.php "''Straight Up'' Tackles Climate in the Blog Era"].  ''Treehugger.com'', April 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The title of the book's introduction, "Why I blog", is a play on the title of [[George Orwell]]'s essay, "[[Why I Write]]".  Romm states, "I joined the [[new media]] because the old media have failed us.  They have utterly failed to force us to face unpleasant facts.  From this starting point, Romm posits that [[global warming]] is a bipartisan issue.  He writes, "Averting catastrophic global warming requires completely overturning the ''status quo'', changing every aspect of how we use energy – and doing so in under four decades.  Failure to do so means humanity's self-destruction."  The book collects, reprints and updates postings from his blog, ClimateProgress.org, as the main part of his content, adding introductions and some new analysis.&lt;ref name=Merchant/&gt;

In his first chapter, Romm argues that the media perpetuates the ''status quo'' through laziness and a misunderstanding of how to present a "balanced" story.  For example, he believes that the media did a bad job of assessing the outcome of the Copenhagen summit in December 2009.  Romm comments that global warming is a science story, but that the traditional news media, which has scaled back on specialized reporting, has given the story to political reporters who don't understand, and have not time to research, the scientific consensus.  He next presents research concerning the science of [[climate change]], as explained by what Romm calls "uncharacteristically blunt scientists".

In the third chapter, ''Straight Up'' presents proposed solutions to reducing [[greenhouse gas emissions]] through the use of clean energy technologies and other currently available technologies.  For example it describes what Romm believes are the advantages of [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]], generation of energy through wind and solar power, including [[concentrated solar power]] using mirrors to concentrate the sun's energy.  He writes that "A 20 percent reduction in global emissions might be possible in a quarter century with net economic benefits".  "Our plan", says Romm, must be "Deployment, deployment, deployment, R&amp;D, deployment, deployment, deployment."  The next chapter discusses [[peak oil]].

The next chapters move into the politics of global warming and what Romm sees as a "right-wing disinformation machine" that confuses and misleads the public, by, for example, fostering what Romm calls "Anti-Scientific Syndrome".  The book says, "the economic cost of action is low, whereas the cost of inaction is incalculably greater – what exactly is the 'price' of 5 feet of sea level rise in 2100 … and losing all of the inland glaciers that provide a significant fraction of water to a billion people?  Or the price of losing half the world's species? ... the bottom line is that the economic cost of action is low, whereas the cost of inaction is incalculably greater". Romm calculates that deployment of existing technologies on the massive scale that can save the climate can be accomplished at the cost of 0.12 percent of global GDP per year.

Romm advocates citizen action to pressure Washington and industry to act quickly and decisively to reduce greenhouse emissions.  Otherwise, he argues, we will fall behind in the race to commercialize profitable technologies.  "China has a excellent track record of achieving gains in energy efficiency and has begun to ramp up its efficiency efforts and aggressively expand its carbon-free electricity targets (recently committing, for instance, to triple its wind goal to 100,000 MW by 2020). ... will the United States be a global leader in creating jobs and exports in clean energy technologies or will we be importing them from Europe, Japan, and the likely clean energy leader in our absence, China"?

In the last chapter, Romm posits that progressives are "lousy" at educating the public, and he offers ways in which he thinks they can be more effective at messaging.  In his conclusion at the end of the book, Romm argues that the global economy is a sort of [[ponzi scheme]], in which our failure to prevent the worst effects of climate change now could eventually cause the world economy to fall apart just like a ponzi scheme.

==Reception==

===Initial reviews===
A review in ''[[USA Today]]'' called the book "a gut-wrenching wakeup call".&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Wendy. [http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2010/04/how-bad-is-climate-change-dont-ask-expert-joe-romm/1 "How bad is climate change? Don't ask expert Joe Romm"]. ''USA Today'' Greenhouse, April 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas L. Friedman]], in his op-ed column in ''[[The New York Times]]'', called the book "insightful", agreeing with Romm's arguments in the book that the proposed [[American Clean Energy and Security Act|"cap and trade" climate bill]] "is a step in the right direction toward reducing greenhouse gases and expanding our base of clean power technologies".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/opinion/25friedman.html?src=mv "Tea Party With a Difference"].  ''The New York Times'', April 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Former U.S. Vice-President [[Al Gore]] endorsed the book as "important" on his blog, writing, "If you are interested in the fight to solve the climate crisis, I recommend you read this book."&lt;ref&gt;Gore, Al. [http://blog.algore.com/2010/04/an_important_new_book.html "An Important New Book"].  ''Al's Journal'', April 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been reviewed by many of the "green" websites.  For example, the blog of the [[American Solar Energy Society]], ''Solar Today'', commented, "It's a collection of spirited and readable critiques of the delaying forces – the corporations and institutions who want to see no changes in national policies and tax codes that now work to make them rich.  In particular, Romm eviscerates the American news establishment for ignoring climate catastrophe issues". ...  It's full of solid fact-based arguments, properly referenced within the text (no footnotes!), along with a lot of low-carbon fire and brimstone.&lt;ref&gt;Masia. Seth. [http://ases.org/index.php?option=com_myblog&amp;show=Book-review-Straight-Up-by-Joe-Romm.html&amp;Itemid=27 "Book review: ''Straight Up'', by Joe Romm"]. ''Solar Today'', American Solar Energy Society, April 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Daily Kos]]'' commented, "Romm's forceful, impassioned blogging – and his book publishing – are a shining light in the confrontation of those 'misguided seals of approval'" being given out by the mainstream press to climate disinformers.  The review continues, "Romm is a tenacious fighter ... ready to take on all comers to the point that he can even rub 'friends' and allies the wrong way at times. ... Romm's knowledge, writing skills, and passion enable most to see past those conflicts since, on so many issues, Romm is simply – well – correct and laying out viable paths forward. ... Simply put, if the 'nation' would read ''Straight Up'' and follow Romm's prescriptions, we would find ourselves moving away from decline into a new era of prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, A. [http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/4/26/861100/-Energy-Bookshelf:-Tell-it-Straight-Up! "Energy Bookshelf: Tell it Straight Up!"] ''Daily Kos'', April 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Green Energy Reporter'' stated that "''Straight Up's'' indictment of "status-quo media" like ''The New York Times'' lays bare the inadequacies of traditional he-said-she-said media coverage when faced with a civilizational challenge like climate change. ...  Strong opinions, muscular writing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenenergyreporter.com/2010/05/april-top-ten-players-in-green-energy/ "April Top Ten Players In Green Energy – #9 Joe Romm] in ''Green Energy Reporter'', May 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporter [[Tyler Hamilton (reporter)|Tyler Hamilton]] calls the book "a stinging critique of how poorly the mainstream media has covered global warming"&lt;ref name=Hamilton/&gt; and says that the book, like Romm's blog, "cuts through the crap in a way no mainstream media outlet has or will."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleanbreak.ca/2010/08/30/joe-romms-book-straight-up-is-a-treasure-of-climate-related-widsom/ "Joe Romm’s book Straight Up is a treasure of climate-related widsom"]. Clean Break, Green Living Network, August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A review in [[TreeHugger]] termed the book "an essential guide to climate, energy, and politics for the blog era."  It continued, "nobody knows the game like Romm – both in terms of ability to interpret and explain the latest science, and in boasting expertise on the politics and policy process that, whether you like it our not, is going to be instrumental in mitigating climate change on a large scale."  Even for readers of Romm's blog, the book "provides an important narrative flow, and condenses everything you need to know about the current state of climate science and politics into a nice, quick read.  While extremely thorough, it may make some beginners' head spin, and it can get combative and wonky in places.  But such is the nature of this beast – climate change ''should'' make a beginner's head spin, and as Romm makes clear, addressing it is going to be messy, politically charged, and a daunting battle."&lt;ref name=Merchant/&gt;  The ''[[Environmental Defense Fund]]'' review opined, "''Straight Up'' is well-researched, provides insightful political analysis, and showcases compelling data on the economic benefits of climate change solutions."&lt;ref&gt;Kreindler, Tony. [http://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2010/04/19/joe-romm%E2%80%99s-straight-up-is-a-great-resource-for-fact-seekers-on-climate/ "Joe Romm’s ''Straight Up'' is a great resource for fact seekers on climate"].  [[Environmental Defense Fund]], April 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ross Gelbspan]] reviewed the book for ''[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]'' magazine, writing that Romm's "unfailing sense of priorities shines through his startlingly thoughtful and brutally blunt writing."  Gelbspan continues, "while one wishes Romm would have stitched the blog posts together into a more coherent narrative – and omitted a few that addressed transitory, fleeting events – his book is absolutely on point in its insistence that climate change long ago ceased to be a scientific issue and, instead, is most clearly a political one."  Gelbspan agrees with Romm that "a central reason that most political conservatives and libertarians deny the reality of human-induced climate change 'is that they simply cannot stand the solution.  So they attack both the solution and the science.'  I don't recall reading that simple truth in [traditional media,] virtually all of which treat the climate debate as though it actually had some legitimacy."  He also agrees with Romm that the major media "have failed, in the name of 'journalistic balance', to distinguish between legitimate, peer-reviewed scientific research and the deliberate obfuscation by a cadre of climate skeptics, many of whom have been funded by coal and oil companies.  As a result, the public has no idea that we are already at a point of no return in terms of staving off climate chaos."  Gelbspan notes, "Romm happens to favor both [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]] and concentrated solar thermal power.  But, his technological preferences aside, he's right on point when he describes the call for more R&amp;D as a stalling tactic to avoid coming to grips with the threat.  As Romm writes, 'deployment completely trumps research'."  However, Gelbspan criticizes Romm for "wandering", at the end of the book, "into the question of why climate advocates are so bad at 'messaging.'  It may be a valid question. ... But I'm afraid the issue [is] a diversion from the real question facing all of us at this moment of history. ... We are already beginning to see crop failures, water shortages, increasing extinctions, migrations of environmental refugees, and all manner of potential breakdowns in our social lives.  Where ''Straight Up'' falls short is in its failure to deal with this reality head on."  Still, he says, "This is not at all to minimize the value of Romm's book.  To the contrary, if you think the most pressing task today is to limit the coming damage through a transition to non-carbon technologies, I can't think of a better place to start than by reading ''Straight Up''."&lt;ref&gt;Gelbspan, Ross. [http://www.grist.org/article/2010-04-26-a-thumbs-up-for-joe-romms-climate-book-straight-up/ "A near thumbs-up for Joe Romm's ''Straight Up''"]. ''Grist'' magazine, April 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later assessments===
In June 2010, FDL Book Salon said of the book, "the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. By pulling together the very best content from the blog and thoughtfully organizing it in a logical way, the book achieves ... cohesiveness. ... [What makes Romm's] writing on climate change and energy policy so valuable is his comprehensive knowledge of the subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Josh. [http://firedoglake.com/2010/06/20/fdl-book-salon-welcomes-joseph-romm-straight-up/ "FDL Book Salon Welcomes Joseph J. Romm"]. FDL Book Salon at Firedoglake.com, June 20, 2010, accessed June 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A review the same month in the New Zealand climate blog ''Hot Topic'' contains a detailed summary of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Bryan. [http://hot-topic.co.nz/straight-up/ ''Straight Up''].  ''Hot Topic'', June 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A July 2010 review in [[PennWell Corporation|RenewableEnergyWorld.com]] agreed with Romm that "with the little time we have left to avert climate chaos, we must devote most of our resources to deploying existing technologies like solar, wind and geothermal that we know can bring atmospheric carbon back down down to safe levels."&lt;ref&gt;Etelson, Erica. [http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2010/07/great-beach-reading-for-a-hot-planet "Great Beach Reading for a Hot Planet"]. RenewableEnergyWorld.com, accessed July 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, [[Bill McKibben]] wrote in ''[[Washington Monthly]]'':
:Romm ... knows his climate science ... cold. Trained as a physicist, he is unintimidated by scholarly work, and is able to synthesize huge amounts of complex data. He has been a persuasive voice for the most important truth about global warming: that it is a far worse problem than either politicians or the general public understand.  In his posts and in his previous book ''[[Hell and High Water (book)|Hell and High Water]]'' Romm has made the stakes clear. “If we stay anywhere near our current emissions path,” he writes, the century will bring “staggeringly high temperature rise … [and] sea level rise. ...  Dust bowls will cover the southwestern United States and many other heavily populated regions around the globe.  Massive species loss will occur on land and sea – affecting 50 percent or more of all life.”  These changes ... are relatively uncontroversial middle-of-the-road projections. ... Romm’s willingness to repeat these concerns ... has been essential in emboldening a few opinion writers – [[Thomas L. Friedman|Tom Friedman]], for instance – to keep this message in the mainstream media. ...  Romm has been consistent in insisting that we have much of the technology necessary to at least begin tackling the problem. He regularly documents the gains we could easily squeeze from commonsense efficiencies ... [and current technologies,] the plug-in hybrid car, for example. ...  Romm is very clear on the economics of climate change: any large-scale adjustment, while not cheap, is affordable, and neglecting the issue as we have done will prove to be very expensive in the long run.  Indeed, it’s hard to read him without understanding just how disingenuous and shortsighted is the Republican argument that we should ignore global warming because it will cost us money. ...  The [2009] McKinsey report ... estimate[s that] most of the first few decades of carbon trimming will actually make us money. ...

:The second half of Straight Up ... covers the politics of climate.  [Romm has been] a tireless foil to the “right-wing disinformation machine” that has tried – with great success ... to delay action by confusing and disheartening Americans about global warming.  The right’s basic message ... is not supported by the evidence.  It is, however, supported by both a good deal of fossil-fuel industry cash and a good deal of wishful thinking from all of us who are so used to the lifestyles underwritten by cheap fossil fuel.  It requires a thick skin to take on the daily task of dealing with the disinformers, but Romm has the taste for this kind of blood sport, and the talent as well.  He coined the term “anti-science syndrome” (and its rude acronym) for the campaign to undermine the scientific consensus.  He’s waged memorable wars with, say, [[Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley|Lord Monckton]] ... who dropped his earlier campaign to quarantine all AIDS sufferers. ...   Romm is also stern with progressives, mostly for their poor messaging on climate issues. ...  In fact, my main dispute with Romm’s work is his relentless focus on Washington. Since the advent of the Obama administration he has devoted a great deal of his fierceness to attacking anyone who questions the legislative solutions to climate change put forward by the Democrats in the White House and Congress. ...  It’s not that his message is absurd.  We do desperately need action from Washington on climate change. ...  But Romm’s hyper-realism may ignore more important political possibilities. He’s paid less attention to the emerging popular movement on climate change than to the machinations of the Senate, but if we’re actually going to get change on the scale we need, it’s quite possible it won’t happen without an aggressive, large, and noisy movement demanding that change. And Romm, who would have a good deal of useful things to say to such a movement, hasn’t been very interested.&lt;ref&gt;McKibben, Bill, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Climate+of+opinion%3A+blogger+Joe+Romm+drives+the+global+warming+debate...-a0231408228 "Climate of Opinion"], ''Washington Monthly'', reproduced in TheFreeLibrary.com, July/August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sudines''' (or '''Soudines''') (Greek: Σουδινες) ([[floruit|fl.]] c. 240 BC): [[Babylonia]]n sage. He is mentioned as one of the famous [[Chaldea]]n [[Babylonian mathematics|mathematicians]] and [[Babylonian astronomy|astronomer]]-[[Babylonian astrology|astrologers]] by later Roman writers like [[Strabo]] (''Geografia'' 16:1–6).

Like his predecessor [[Berossus|Berossos]], he moved from Babylonia and established himself among the [[Greeks]]; he was an advisor to King [[Attalus I]] (Attalos Soter) of [[Pergamon]].  He is said (e.g. by Roman astronomer/astrologer Vettius Valens) to have published tables to compute the [[lunar theory|motion]] of the [[Moon]];  said to have been used by the Greeks, until superseded by the work of [[Hipparchus]] and later by [[Ptolemy]] (Claudius Ptolemaios).  Soudines may have been important in transmitting the [[astronomical]] knowledge of the Babylonians to the Greeks, but little is known about his work and nothing about his life.  He is also said to have been one of the first to assign [[astrology|astrological]] meaning to [[gemstone]]s.

'''''The Malay Archipelago''''' is a book by the British naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] which chronicles his scientific exploration, during the eight-year period 1854 to 1862, of the southern portion of the [[Malay Archipelago]] including [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], the islands of [[Indonesia]], then known as the [[Dutch East Indies]], and the island of [[New Guinea]]. It was published in two volumes in 1869, delayed by Wallace's ill health and the work needed to describe the many specimens he brought home. The book went through ten editions in the nineteenth century; it has been reprinted many times since, and has been translated into at least eight languages.

The book describes each island that he visited in turn, giving a detailed account of its [[physical geography|physical]] and [[human geography]], its [[volcano]]es, and the variety of animals and plants that he found and collected. At the same time, he describes his experiences, the difficulties of travel, and the help he received from the different peoples that he met. The preface notes that he travelled over 14,000 miles and collected 125,660 [[natural history]] specimens, mostly of insects though also thousands of [[molluscs]], [[bird]]s, [[mammals]] and [[reptile]]s.

The work was illustrated with engravings, based on Wallace's observations and collection, by the leading illustrators [[Thomas Baines]], [[Walter Hood Fitch]], [[John Gerrard Keulemans]], [[E. W. Robinson]], [[Joseph Wolf]] and [[T. W. Wood]].

''The Malay Archipelago'' attracted many reviews, with interest from scientific, geographic, church and general periodicals. Reviewers noted and sometimes disagreed with various of his theories, especially the division of [[fauna]] and [[flora]] along what soon became known as the [[Wallace line]], [[natural selection]] and [[uniformitarianism]]. Nearly all agreed that he had provided an interesting and comprehensive account of the [[geography]], [[natural history]], and [[anthropology|peoples]] of the archipelago, which was little known to their readers at the time, and that he had collected an astonishing number of specimens. The book is much cited, and is Wallace's most successful, both commercially and as a piece of literature.

== Context ==

In 1847, Wallace and his friend [[Henry Walter Bates]], both in their early twenties,{{efn|Bates was 22, Wallace was 24.}} agreed that they would jointly make a collecting trip to the Amazon "towards solving the problem of origin of species".&lt;ref name=Mallet&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/Bates63.html | title=Henry Walter Bates | publisher=University College London | accessdate=11 December 2012 | author=Mallet, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Charles Darwin]]'s book on the ''[[Origin of Species]]'' was not published until 11 years later, in 1859. It was based on Darwin's own long collecting trip on [[The Voyage of the Beagle|HMS Beagle]], its publication precipitated by a famous letter from Wallace, sent during the period covered by ''The Malay Archipelago'' while he was staying in [[Ternate]], which described the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] in outline.&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.dispatchesfromthevanishingworld.com/pastdispatches/naturalists/printerbates.html | title=A Critic at Large, Henry Walter Bates | author=Shoumatoff, Alex | journal=New Yorker | date=22 August 1988 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806030238/http://www.dispatchesfromthevanishingworld.com/pastdispatches/naturalists/printerbates.html | archivedate=6 August 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Wallace and Bates had been inspired by reading the American [[entomologist]] [[William Henry Edwards]]'s pioneering 1847 book ''A Voyage Up the River Amazon, with a residency at Pará''.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 1847.&lt;/ref&gt; Bates stayed in the Amazons for 11 years, going on to write ''[[The Naturalist on the River Amazons]]'' (1863); however, Wallace, ill with fever, went home in 1852 with thousands of specimens, some for science and some for sale. The ship and his collection were destroyed by fire at sea near the Guianas. Rather than giving up, Wallace wrote about the Amazon in both prose and poetry, and then set sail again, this time for the Malay Archipelago.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

==Overview==

The preface summarises Wallace's travels, the thousands of specimens he collected, and some of the results from their analysis after his return to England. In the preface he notes that he travelled over 14,000 miles and collected 125,660 specimens, mostly of insects: 83,200 [[beetles]], 13,100 [[Lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]], 13,400 other insects. He also returned to England 7,500 "shells" (such as [[molluscs]]), 8,050 birds, 310 [[mammals]] and 100 reptiles.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of Malay Archipelago Wallace 1869.jpg|thumb|upright=3|Fold-out coloured map at front of book, showing Wallace's travels around the archipelago. The deep water that separates [[Borneo]] from [[Sulawesi]] (Celebes) forms what became known as the [[Wallace line]].|alt=Original map showing Wallace's travels]]

The book is dedicated to [[Charles Darwin]], but as Wallace explains in the preface, he has chosen to avoid discussing the [[evolution]]ary implications of his discoveries. Instead he confines himself to the "interesting facts of the problem, whose solution is to be found in the principles developed by Mr. Darwin",&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; so from a scientific point of view, the book is largely a descriptive [[natural history]]. This modesty belies the fact that while in [[Sarawak]] in 1855 Wallace wrote the paper ''On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species'', concluding with the evolutionary "Sarawak Law", "Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species", three years before he fatefully wrote to Darwin proposing the concept of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Alfred Russel |title=On the Law Which has Regulated the Introduction of Species |url=http://www.wku.edu/%7Esmithch/wallace/S020.htm |year=1855 |publisher=[[Western Kentucky University]] |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first chapter describes the [[physical geography]] and geology of the islands with particular attention to the role of [[volcanoes]] and earthquakes. It also discusses the overall pattern of the flora and fauna including the fact that the islands can be divided, by what would eventually become known as the [[Wallace line]], into two parts, those whose animals are more closely related to those of Asia and those whose fauna is closer to that of Australia.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 1, pp. 1–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following chapters describe in detail the places Wallace visited. Wallace includes numerous observations on the people, their languages, ways of living, and social organisation, as well as on the plants and animals found in each location. He talks about the [[biogeographic]] patterns he observes and their implications for [[natural history]], in terms both of the movement of species{{efn|Implying [[adaptive radiation]].}} and of the geologic history of the region. He also narrates some of his personal experiences during his travels.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869.&lt;/ref&gt; The final chapter is an overview of the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions among the people who live in the region and speculation about what such divisions might indicate about their history.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, pp. 439–464.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==

[[File:Treeps House.jpg|thumb|Treeps, [[Hurstpierpoint]], the house where ''The Malay Archipelago'' was largely written]]
''The Malay Archipelago'' was largely written at Treeps, Wallace's wife's family home in [[Hurstpierpoint]], [[West Sussex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wallacefund.info/2005-treeps-plaque |title=2005-"Treeps" plaque |last1=Beccaloni |first1=George |date=2008 |website=The Alfred Russel Wallace Website |access-date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first published in Spring 1869 as a single volume first edition, however was reprinted in two volumes by Macmillan (London), marked second edition the same year  by Harper &amp; Brothers (New York). Wallace returned to England in 1862, but explains in the Preface that given the large quantity of specimens and his poor health after his stay in the tropics, it took a long time. He noted that he could at once have printed his notes and journals, but felt that doing that would have been disappointing and unhelpful. Instead, therefore, he waited until he had published papers on his discoveries, and other scientists had described and named as new species some 2,000 of his beetles ([[Coleoptera]]), and over 900 [[Hymenoptera]] including 200 new species of [[ant]].&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. pp. vii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The book went through 10 editions, with the last published in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wallace-online.org/content/search-results?pagesize=50&amp;searchtitle=Malay+archipelago&amp;pageno=1&amp;datebefore=&amp;publisher=&amp;searchid=&amp;allfields=&amp;description=&amp;name=Wallace+Alfred+Russel&amp;freetext=&amp;place=&amp;periodical=&amp;dateafter=&amp;documenttype=Book&amp;sort=identifier | title=Malay Archipelago | publisher=Wallace Online, National University of Singapore | year=2012 | accessdate=23 June 2013 | author=van Wyne, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illustrations are, according to the ''Preface'', made from Wallace's own sketches, photographs, or specimens. Wallace thanks Walter and Henry Woodbury for some photographs of scenery and native people. He acknowledges William Wilson Saunders and Mr Pascoe for horned flies and very rare longhorn beetles: all the rest were from his own enormous collection.&lt;!--The citation for this is given explicitly in the text.--&gt;

The original drawings were made directly on to the [[wood engraving]] blocks by leading artists [[Thomas Baines]], [[Walter Hood Fitch]], [[John Gerrard Keulemans]], [[E. W. Robinson]], [[Joseph Wolf]], and [[T. W. Wood]], according to the ''List of Illustrations''. Wood also illustrated Darwin's ''[[The Descent of Man]]'', while Robinson and Wolf both also provided illustrations for ''[[The Naturalist on the River Amazons]]'' (1863), written by Wallace's friend [[Henry Walter Bates]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:E._W._Robinson Commons Category:E.

==Contents==

===Volume 1===

;1 Physical Geography
: Wallace sets out the scope of the book, describing what "To the ordinary Englishman" is "perhaps the least known part of the globe."&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 1, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The archipelago, he explains, stretches more than 4,000 miles east to west, and about 1,300 miles north to south, with over twenty sizeable islands and innumerable isles and islets.

====Indo-Malay Islands====
[[File:Malay Archipelago Beetles.jpg|thumb|"Remarkable Beetles Found at Simunjon, Borneo: ''Neocerambyx æneas, Cladognathus tarandus, Diurus furcellatus, Ectatorhinus Wallacei, Megacriodes Saundersii, Cyriopalpus Wallacei''"]]

;2 Singapore
: Wallace gives a lively description of the people of the town, and of the wildlife of the island. He finds the Chinese the most noticeable of the people, while in one square mile of forest he found 700 species of beetles including 130 [[Cerambycidae|longhorns]].

;3 [[Malacca]] and Mount Ophir.
: He finds an attractive old Portuguese town, and beautiful birds such as the blue-billed gaper. The flora includes [[pitcher plant]]s and giant ferns. There are tigers and rhinoceros, but the elephants had already disappeared.

;4 [[Borneo]]—The Orang-Utan
: He stays in [[Sarawak]], and finds the [[Simunjan District|Simunjon]] coal-works convenient, as the workers are happy to be paid a little for insects they find, including locusts, stick insects and about 24 new species of beetles each day. In all he collects 2000 species of beetle in Borneo, nearly all at the coal mine site; he also found a flying frog and [[orang-utan]]s in the same place.

[[File:Malay Archipelago Dyak crossing a bamboo bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Dayak people|Dyak]] crossing a bamboo bridge]]
;5 Borneo—Journey in the Interior
: Wallace returns to Sarawak, where he stays in the circular 'head-house' of a [[Dayak people|Dyak]] village, travels upriver, and describes the Durian, praising it as the king of fruits with exquisite and unsurpassed flavour,&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 1, pp. 117–119.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dyak's slender bamboo bridges,&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 1, pp. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ferns and ''[[Nepenthes]]'' pitcher plants. On a mountain he finds the only place in his entire journey where [[moth]]s are abundant; he collected 1,386 moths on a total of 26 nights, but over 800 of these were caught on four very wet and dark nights. He attributes the reason to having a ceiling that effectively trapped the moths; in other houses the moths at once escaped into the roof, and he recommends naturalists to bring a verandah-shaped tent to enable them to catch moths.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 1, pp. 132–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

;6 Borneo—The Dyaks
: Wallace describes the [[Dayak people|Dyak people]], expressing surprise that despite [[Thomas Malthus]]'s predictions for the human population of the world, and the lack of any obvious restraints, the Dyak population appeared to be stable.

;7 [[Java]]
: Wallace stayed three and a half months in Java, where he admires the system of government and the contented people. The population is, he notes, rapidly increasing, from 3.5 million in 1800 to 5.5 million in 1826 and 14 million in 1865. He enjoys the fine Hindu archaeological sites, and the flora of the mountain tops which have plants resembling those of Europe, including the royal cowslip, ''Primula imperialis'', [[endemism|endemic]] to one mountain top.

;8 [[Sumatra]]
: He visits Sumatra while the coastal forest of ''[[Nypa fruticans|Nipa]]'' palms is flooded to a distance of several miles from the sea. The river houses at Palembang are built on rafts moored to piles, rising and falling with the tide. He admires the [[rumah adat|traditional houses]] of the villages, but had difficulty getting any food there, the people living entirely on rice through the rainy season. He discovers some new species of butterfly including ''[[Papilio memnon]]'' which occurs in different forms, some being [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimics]] of ''[[Atrophaneura coon|Papilio coon]]''. He admires the [[camouflage]] of a species of [[Kallima|dead leaf butterfly]], ''[[Paphia paralekta|Kallima paralekta]]''. He is pleased that one of his hunters brings him a male [[hornbill]], shot at its nest hole while feeding the female.

;9 [[Natural History]] Of The Indo-Malay Islands.
: Wallace sketches the natural history of the islands to the West of the Wallace line, noting that the flora is like that of India, as described by the [[botany|botanist]] [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] in his 1855 ''Flora Indica''. Similarly the mammals are similar to those of India, including the tiger, [[leopard]], [[rhinoceros]] and elephant. The bird species had diverged, but the [[genus|genera]] were mainly the same, and some species of (for example) woodpecker, parrot, kingfisher and pheasant were found from India to Java and Borneo, while many more were found both in Sumatra and the Malay peninsula.

====The Timor Group====
[[File:Timor Men in Malay Archipelago drawn by T Baines from a photo.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of "Timor Men" by [[Thomas Baines]], from a photograph]]

;10 [[Bali]] And [[Lombok|Lombock]]
: Wallace is grateful for an involuntary stop in Bali, which he finds one of the most interesting places of his trip, as Hindu customs and religion are still practised, while on Lombok he finds Australian birds such as cockatoos, observing that this is the most westerly point of that family's range.

;11 Lombock—Manners And Customs
: On Lombok, Wallace observes how guns are made, witnessing the boring of gun barrels by two men rotating a pole which is weighted down by a basket of stones. He describes the [[Sasak people]] of the island, and the custom of running [[amok]].

;12 Lombock—How The Rajah Took The Census
: The whole chapter is taken up with a legend, which Wallace calls an anecdote, about the rajah (king) of Lombok. It involves taxation, needles and sacred [[kris]]ses.

;13 [[Timor]]
: Wallace describes the island of Timor, its abundance of fan-palms, its people who are like Papuans, and the Portuguese government which he considers extremely poor. On some hills he finds ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' (gum) trees, a genus from Australia; he finds the vegetation monotonous also.

;14 Natural History of the Timor Group
: He finds the mixture of bird species intermediate between those of Java and Australia, with 36 species actually Javan, and 11 closely related; while there are only 13 actually Australian, with 35 closely related. Wallace interprets this to mean that a small number of birds from Australia, and a larger number from Java, colonised Timor and then evolved into new species endemic to the island. The land mammals were very few in number: the six species were endemic or related to those of Java or the Moluccas, with none from Australia, so he doubts there was ever a land bridge to that continent.

====The Celebes Group====
[[File:Babirusa skull engraving in Malay Archipelago 1869.jpg|thumb|Skull of a [[babirusa]] (pig-deer) from the [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], by E. W. Robinson]]

;15 [[Sulawesi|Celebes]]—Macassar
: Wallace finds staying in the town of [[Makassar|Macassar]] expensive, and moves out into the countryside. He meets the rajah, and is lucky enough to stay on a farm where he is given a glass of milk every day, "one of my greatest luxuries".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 1, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

;16 Celebes—Macassar
: He catches some ''[[Ornithoptera]]'' (birdwings), "the largest, the most perfect, and the most beautiful of butterflies".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 1, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses rotten jackfruit to attract beetles, but finds few birds. The limestone mountains are eroded into skittle-shaped pillars with narrow bases.

;17 Celebes—Menado
: Wallace visits [[Menado]] on the northeast coast of Celebes. The [[Minahasa|people of the Minahasa region]] are fair-skinned, unlike anywhere else in the archipelago. He stays high in the mountains by the coffee plantations, and is often cold, but finds that the animals are no different from those lower down. The forest was full of [[orchids]], [[bromeliads]], [[clubmosses]] and [[moss]]es. He experiences an earthquake, but the low timber-framed houses survive with little damage. He finds that the people, under the guidance of [[missionaries]], are the most hard-working, peaceful and civilised of the whole archipelago. He obtains (apparently by purchase) skulls of the [[babirusa]] (pig-deer) and the rare [[Bubalus depressicornis|sapiutan]] (midget buffalo).

;18 Natural History of Celebes
: He describes the range of species in each group in some detail, concluding that the birds are unlike those of any of the surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; he thinks there is nowhere else where so many such species occur in one place. Similarly in the [[Nymphalidae]] (he mentions the English member, the [[purple emperor]] butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. He concludes that the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.

====The Moluccas====

;19 [[Banda Islands|Banda]]
: He finds Banda delightful, with a smoking volcano and a fine view from the top. The [[nutmeg]] trees are beautiful but he regrets the ending of the Dutch monopoly in the nutmeg trade, which avoided the need to levy direct taxes. The only indigenous animals, he thinks, are [[bats]], except possibly for its [[opossum]] species.

;20 [[Ambon Island|Amboyna]]
: He finds the inhabitants of Amboyna lazy, but the harbour contained the most beautiful sight, "a continuous series of [[coral]]s, [[sponge]]s, actiniæ, and other marine productions, of magnificent dimensions, varied forms, and brilliant colours."&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 1, p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt; A large [[Python (genus)|python]] has to be ejected from the roof-space of his house. He enjoys the true [[breadfruit]], which he considers good in many dishes but best simply baked.

===Volume 2===

====The Moluccas (continued)====

;21 [[Ternate]]
: Wallace takes on and repairs a house which he keeps for three years, drawing a plan of it in the book; it has stone walls 3 feet (1 metre) high, with posts holding up the roof; the walls and ceiling are made of the [[Petiole (botany)|leaf-stems]] of the [[Metroxylon sagu|sago palm]]. He has a well of clean cold water, and the market provides "unwonted luxuries" of fresh food; he returns here to restore his health after arduous journeys.

;22 [[Halmahera|Gilolo]]
: He finds the large island rather dull, with much tall coarse grass and few species. In the forest he obtains some small "parroquets", brush-tongued lories, and the day-flying moth ''[[Cocytia]] d'Urvillei''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.papua-insects.nl/insect%20orders/Lepidoptera/Erebidae/Erebinae/Cocytiini/Cocytia/Cocytia%20durvillii.htm | title=''Cocytia durvillii'' | publisher=Papua Insects Foundation | accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: He hires a small boat to go to the highly recommended island of Batchian and crosses to [[Tidore]], where he sees the comet of October 1858; it spans about 20 degrees of the night sky. They sail past the volcanic island of [[Makian]] which erupted in 1646 and devastatingly again, soon after Wallace had left the archipelago, in 1862. In the Kaióa Islands he finds some virgin forest where the beetles are more abundant than anywhere he ever saw in his life, with swarms of golden [[Buprestidae]], rose-chafers, and long-horned weevils, as well as longicorn beetles. "It was a glorious spot, and one which will always live in my memory as exhibiting the insect-life of the tropics in unexampled luxuriance."&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malay Archipelago Wallace's Standardwing.jpg|thumb|upright|Male and female of [[Wallace's standardwing]] from [[Batchian]], drawn on wood by Dutch engraver [[John Gerrard Keulemans]]]]
;24 [[Bacan|Batchian]]
: He is lent a house by the Sultan, who offers him tea and cakes but asks him to teach him to make maps and to give him a gun and a milking goat, "all of which requests I evaded as skilfully as I was able".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; His servant Ali shoots a new bird of paradise, [[Wallace's standardwing]], "a great prize" and a "striking novelty".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a little disappointed in the range of insects and birds, but discovers new species of [[Eurystomus azureus|roller]], [[sunbird]] and is happy to see the [[common paradise kingfisher|racquet-tailed kingfisher]]. His house is burgled twice; a blacksmith manages to pick his locks and make him a new set of keys; and he discovers a new species of birdwing butterfly.

;25 [[Seram Island|Ceram]], [[Gorong archipelago|Goram]], and the [[Watubela archipelago|Matabello Islands]]
: He travels to Ceram, where he enjoys the company of a multilingual [[Flanders|Flemish]] plantation owner. He finds few birds despite constant searching and wading through rivers; the water and the rough ground destroy both his pairs of shoes, and he returns home on the last day lame from walking "in my stockings very painfully".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Sailing in the Matabello Islands, he is blown ten miles off course, his men fearing being swept on to the coast of [[New Guinea]] "in which case we should most likely all be murdered" as the tribes there are treacherous and bloodthirsty.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, pp. 99–100, 111.&lt;/ref&gt; He is sorry to see that even the smallest children here all chew betel-nut and are disfigured by sores from a poor diet. However he enjoys their palm wine which he finds more like cider than beer, and the "water" inside young coconuts, which, he explains, is nothing like the undrinkable contents of the old dry coconuts on sale in England. He buys a [[prau]] and surprises the people by fitting it out himself, using tools "of the best London make", but lacking a large drill the holes have to be made, very slowly, by boring with hot iron rods.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Travelling round Ceram, the crew from Goram run away. He describes in detail the process of making [[sago]].

;26 [[Buru|Bouru]]
: He finds he has arrived in the rainy season, seeing mainly mud and water. He complains that two months' work produce only 210 species of beetle, compared to 300 in three weeks at Amboyna. However one ''[[Cerambyx]]'' beetle was up to 3 inches (7.5&amp;nbsp;cm) long, with antennae up to 5 inches (12.5&amp;nbsp;cm) in length. He is amused at himself for finding his simple hut comfortable, once he has made a rough table and is in his [[rattan]] chair, with a mosquito net and "large [[Tartan|Scotch plaid]]" to form a "little sleeping apartment". He gets 17 new (at least for the Moluccas) species of bird including a new ''[[Pitta (genus)|Pitta]]'' bird.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

;27 The Natural History of the Moluccas
: The only carnivore in the Moluccas is the [[Malayan civet]] (Musang), which he supposes has been introduced by accident as it is kept for its [[musk]]. The Celebes Babirusa is, oddly, found on Bouru, which he supposes it reached partly by swimming, citing [[Charles Lyell|Sir Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'' to confirm this ability. The other mammals are [[marsupial]], so, he presumes, true natives. In contrast to the few mammals, there are at least 265 bird species, more than all of Europe, which had 257, but of these just three groups – parrots, kingfishers and pigeons – make up nearly a third, compared to only a twentieth of the birds of India. Wallace suggests this is because they came from New Guinea, which has a similar lack of some groups, and adds that many New Guinea birds have not reached the Moluccas, implying that the islands have been isolated for a long time.

====Papuan Group====
[[File:Malay Archipelago Papuan charm.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Papuan charm, by E.&amp;nbsp;W. Robinson]]

;28 Macassar to the Aru Islands in a Native [[Prau]]
: Wallace decides to avoid the rainy season of Celebes by travelling to the Aru Islands, the source of [[pearls]], [[mother-of-pearl]], and [[tortoiseshell]] for Europe, and [[bird's nest soup|edible birds' nests]] and sea-slugs for China, even though they are inhabited by "savages". He is excited despite the danger of a 1,000-mile (1600 km) voyage in a 70-ton [[Bugis]] prau with a crew of 50, considering the islands the "''[[Ultima Thule]]'' of the East". His small cabin was the "snuggest" he ever had at sea, and he liked the natural materials and the absence of foul-smelling paint and tar.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, pp. 158–162.&lt;/ref&gt; The Molucca sea was phosphorescent, like a [[nebula]] seen in a telescope. He sees [[flying fish]] near Teor, which is wrongly marked on the charts.

;29 The [[Kai Islands|Ké Islands]]
: The prau is greeted by 3 or 4 long high-beaked canoes, about 50 men naked but for shells and long plumes of [[cassowary]] feathers, singing and shouting as they rowed, who board the prow with high exuberance "intoxicated with joy and excitement" asking for tobacco.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; It is at once clear to Wallace these Papuans are not Malays in appearance or behaviour.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; They are expert boat-builders, using only axe, adze and auger, fitting planks together so well that a knife-blade can hardly be inserted anywhere.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, pp. 184–186.&lt;/ref&gt; They use no money, bartering for knives, cloth and "arrack" brandy, and bring many beetles including a new [[Buprestidae|jewel beetle]] species, ''[[Cyphogastra calepyga]]'', in return for tobacco.

;30 The [[Aru Islands]]—Residence in Dobbo
: On one day he captures about 30 species of butterfly, the most since he was in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], including the "large and handsome spectre-butterfly, ''[[Idea (genus)|Hestia durvillei]]''",&lt;ref group=P name=V2P199&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; and a few days later

{{quote|one of the most magnificent insects the world contains, the great bird-winged butterfly, ''[[Ornithoptera priamus|Ornithoptera poseidon]]''. I trembled with excitement as I saw it coming majestically towards me,... and was gazing, lost in admiration, at the velvet black and brilliant green of its wings, seven inches across, its golden body, and crimson breast... The village of Dobbo held that evening at least one contented man."|Wallace&lt;ref group=P name=V2P199/&gt;}}

[[File:Malay Archipelago King and Twelve-wired Birds of Paradise.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|"The 'king' and the 'twelve wired' birds of paradise", drawn on wood by J. G. Keulemans]]
;31 The Aru Islands—Journey and Residence in the Interior
: He is brought a [[king bird-of-paradise]], amusing the islanders with his excitement; it had been one of his goals for travelling to the archipelago. He reflects on how their beauty is wasted in the "dark and gloomy woods, with no intelligent eye to gaze upon their loveliness", but that when "civilized man" reaches the islands he will certainly upset the balance of nature and make the birds extinct.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, pp. 222–224.&lt;/ref&gt; He finds the men the most beautiful of all the peoples he has stayed among, the women less handsome "except in extreme youth".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

;32 The Aru Islands—Second Residence in Dobbo
: He sees a cock-fight in the street, but is more interested in a game of football, played with a hollow ball of rattan, and remarks the "excessive cheapness"&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; of all goods including those made in Europe or America, which he believes causes idleness and drunkenness because there is no need to work hard to obtain goods. He admires a crimson-flowered tree surrounded with flocks of blue and orange lories. He is given some birds' nest soup, which he found almost tasteless.

;33 The Aru Islands—Physical Geography and Aspects of Nature
: The islands are completely crossed by three narrow channels which resemble and are called rivers, though they are inlets of the sea. The wildlife is much like that of New Guinea, 150 miles (240 km) away, which he supposes was once connected by a land bridge. Most flowers are green; large and showy flowers are rare or absent.

;34 [[New Guinea]]—[[Manokwari|Dorey]]
: He travels to New Guinea after long anticipation. The coastal village houses stand in the water; they have boat-shaped rooves, and often have human skulls hanging under the eaves, trophies of battles with their attackers, the Arfaks. The council house has "revolting" carvings of naked figures. He finds the inhabitants often very handsome, as they are tall with aquiline noses and heads of carefully combed "frizzly" hair.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, pp. 305–306.&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to find the birds of paradise described by the French pharmacist and botanist [[René Primevère Lesson]], but is pleased with the horned deer-flies, including ''Elaphomia cervicornis'' and ''E. wallacei''. He injured his ankle and had to rest as it became an ulcer, while all his men had fever, dysentery or ague. When he recovers, birds are scarce, but he finds about 30 species of beetles each day on average; on two memorable days he finds 78 and 95 kinds, his personal record; it takes him 6 hours to pin and lay out the specimens afterwards. In all he collected over 800 species of beetle in Dorey. He leaves "without much regret" as he never visited a place with "more privations and annoyances."&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

;35 Voyage from Ceram to Waigiou
: He is blown far off course while trying to reach his assistant, Mr Allen, losing some men who went ashore, dragging anchor, running on to a coral reef, and guided by an incorrect map; it took 8 days "among the reefs and islands of Waigiou"&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; to return to a safe harbour. He sends a boat to rescue his men; it returns 10 days later without them, but he pays them again, and on the second attempt it returns with his two men, who had survived for a month "on the roots and tender flower-stalks of a species of Bromelia, on shell-fish, and on a few turtles' eggs."&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

;36 [[Waigeo|Waigiou]]
: He builds a palm-leaf hut, which leaks badly until they increase the slope of the roof. He shoots a red bird-of-paradise. He supposes the people to be of mixed race. He sails to Bessir where the chief lends him a tiny hut on stilts, entered by a ladder, and not tall enough to stand up in. He learns to live and work "in a semi-horizontal position";&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; he is the first white man to come to the island. He trades goods for birds-of-paradise; the people do not shoot them with blunt arrows like Aru islanders, but set out fruit as bait on a forked stick, and catch the birds with a noose of cord that hangs from the stick down to the ground, pulling the cord when the bird arrives, sometimes after two or three days.

;37 Voyage from Waigiou to [[Ternate]]
: While sailing back to Ternate the boat is overtaken by a dozen waves which approached with a dull roaring like heavy surf, the sea being "perfectly smooth"&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; before and after; he concludes these must have been [[Tsunami|earthquake waves]] as [[William Dampier]] had described. Later he learnt that there had been an earthquake on Gilolo that day. On the journey they lose their anchor, and their mooring cable is snapped by a squall. New wooden anchors are ingeniously made. The men believe the boat is unlucky and ask for a ceremony before travelling further. They are caught by a storm and lose the small boat they are towing. Wallace notes that in 78 days there was "not one single day of fair wind." (sic)&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

;38 The [[Birds of Paradise]]
: Wallace, pointing out that he often journeyed expressly to obtain specimens, describes the birds-of-paradise in detail, and the effects of [[sexual selection]] by the females. He covers the great, king, red, magnificent, superb, golden or six-shafted, standard wing, twelve-wired, and epimaque or long-tailed birds-of-paradise, as well as three New Guinea birds which he considers almost as remarkable. He suggests they could live well if released in the [[palm house|Palm House]] at [[Kew Gardens]]. In all he knows of 18 species, of which 11 are from New Guinea and 8 are endemic to it and Salwatty, or 14 in the general New Guinea area (1 being from the Moluccas and 3 from Australia). His assistant Mr Allen runs into trouble as the people were suspicious of his motives. A year of five voyages had produced only 5 of the 14 species in the New Guinea area.

;39 Natural History of the Papuan Islands
: New Guinea, writes Wallace, is mostly unknown, with only the wildlife of the northwestern peninsula partially explored, but already 250 land birds are known, making the island of great interest. There are few mammals, mostly marsupials, including a kangaroo (first seen by Le Brun in 1714).

[[File:Malay Archipelago Portrait of a Javanese Chief.jpg|thumb|upright|"Portrait of a Javanese Chief"]]
;40 The [[Anthropology|Races of Man]] in the Malay Archipelago
: Wallace ends the book by describing his views on the peoples of the archipelago. He finds the Malays, such as the Javanese, the most civilised, though he describes the Dyaks of Borneo and the Bataks of Sumatra, among others, as "the savage Malays".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes the traveller [[Niccolò de' Conti|Nicolo Conti]]'s 1430 account of them, with other early descriptions. He thinks the Papuan the opposite of the Malay, impulsive and demonstrative where the Malay is impassive and taciturn. He speculates about their origins, and in a note at the end, criticises English society.

====Appendix====

; On [[Cranium|Crania]] And [[Language]]s
: Wallace mentions Huxley's theory, and Dr. Joseph Barnard Davis's book ''Thesaurus Craniorum'', which supposed that human races could be distinguished by the shape of the cranium, the dome of the skull, of which theory Wallace is sceptical. However he lists measurements he had taken of the crania of "Malays" and "Papuans", noting that within the Malay group there was enormous variation. He had few skulls in the Papuan group and there were no definite differences between the two groups.

: The language appendix lists 9 words (black, white, fire, water, large, small, nose, tongue, tooth) in 59 of the languages encountered in the archipelago, and 117 words in 33 of those languages, making it clear that many of the languages have many words in common.

==Reception==

===Contemporary===

''The Malay Archipelago'' was warmly received on publication, often in lengthy reviews that attempted to summarise the book, from the perspective that suited the reviewing periodical. It was reviewed in more than 40 periodicals: a selection of those reviews is summarised below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/second.htm | title=Writings on Wallace | publisher=West Kentucky University | accessdate=16 March 2013 | author=Smith, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Anthropological Review''====

The ''Anthropological Review'' notes that while the descriptions of animal life are "full of interest", "our readers, as anthropologists, will, however, take a keener interest" in the "great man-like ape of Borneo,—the orang-utan, or ''mias'', as it is called by the aborigines". Two pages are taken up with a discussion of the orang utan. The review then turns to Wallace's observations on "the races of man" in the book, observing that the anthropological details given are useful but perhaps chosen to support "a particular theory", namely Wallace's belief that there were eastern and western races—"Malays" and "Papuans", though the boundary between them was east of the Wallace line. The review accepts Wallace's data on natural history, but suspects he was selective in recording details of individuals. It notes that Wallace agreed with French authors that the Polynesians (included in his Papuans) "had a local origin". The review remarks that "Mr Wallace relies more on the diversity of moral features to prove differences of race than on physical peculiarities, although he declares that these are strongly marked" and doubts the difference, and wonders whether the "Javan chief" and the Dyak do not differ more. The review, after ten pages of reflections on race, concludes by recommending the book to its readers as much better than ordinary travel books "and even in the absence of any very stirring incidents" that it will "amply repay the perusal" of both scientific and general readers.&lt;ref name=AR&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yco0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA310#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | journal=Anthropological Review | title=Book Reviews: The Malay Archipelago | author=Anon | year=1869 | volume=7 | pages=310–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Journal of the Ethnological Society of London''====

[[File:Papuan, New Guinea from Malay Archipelago 1869 vol 2 page 322.jpg|thumb|upright|"Papuan, New Guinea" was reprinted from ''The Malay Archipelago'' in the Ethnological Society's review.]]
The ''Journal of the Ethnological Society of London'' focussed exclusively on the ethnology in the book, praising the value both of the information and of Wallace's "thoughtful and suggestive speculation".&lt;ref name=JESL&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Malay Archipelago (Review) | author=Anon | journal=Journal of the Ethnological Society of London |date=March 1869 | volume=1 | pages=81–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review notes that Wallace identified two "types of mankind" in the archipelago, "the Malayan and the Papuan", and that he thought these two had "no traceable affinity to each other". It remarks that Wallace greatly extends knowledge of the people of Timor, Celebes, and the Maluccas, while also adding to what is known of the Malays and Papuans, reprinting his entire description and his engraving of a Papuan. The reviewer remarks that the portrait "would as well suit a Papuan of the south-east coast of New Guinea as any of those whom Mr. Wallace saw", noting however that the southern tribes are more varied in skin colour. The reviewer disagrees with Wallace about the extension of this "Papuan race" as far as Fiji, noting that there are or were people like that in Tasmania, but that their features and height varied widely, perhaps forming a series. The reviewer disagrees also that the Sandwich Islanders and "New Zealanders" (Maori) are related to the Papuans; and with Wallace's claim that the presence of Malay words in Polynesian languages is caused by the "roaming habits" — trade and navigation – of the Malays, arguing instead that the Polynesians long ago migrated from "some common seat in, or near, the Malay Archipelago". The review ends by stating that despite all these disagreements, it holds Wallace's ethnology in "high estimation".&lt;ref name=JESL/&gt;

====Royal Geographical Society====

Sir [[Roderick Murchison]], giving a speech at the ''[[Royal Geographical Society]]'', felt able to "feel a pride" in Wallace's success, and in the "striking contributions" made to science. He takes interest in "Wallace's line" which he calls "this ingenious speculation", with "the two faunas wonderfully contrasted" either side of the deep channel between Borneo and [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], or Bali and Lombok. He points out the same principle between the [[British Isles]] and continental Europe, though there the conclusion is rather that the same fauna and flora is found on both sides. However, Murchison states his disagreement with Wallace's support for [[James Hutton]]'s principle of [[uniformitarianism]], that "''all'' former changes of the outline of the earth were produced slowly", opining that the Bali–Lombok channel probably formed suddenly. He mentions in one sentence that the book contains "interesting and important facts" on [[physical geography]], native inhabitants, [[climate]] and products of the archipelago, and describes Wallace as a great naturalist and a "most attractive writer".&lt;ref name=RGS&gt;{{cite journal | title=Wallace's Malay Archipelago | author=Murchison, Roderick | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society |date=July 1869 | volume=13 | pages=286–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Ladies' Repository''====

One of the shortest reviews was in ''The Ladies' Repository'', which found it

{{quote|a highly valuable and intensely interesting contribution to our knowledge of a part of the world but little known in Europe or America. But few of our tourists ever visit it, and scarcely any have ever gone to explore it. Mr. Wallace is not an amateur traveler, making a hasty visit, to return and write a hasty and almost useless book. He is an enthusiastic naturalist, a geographer, and geologist, a student of man and nature.|&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Malay Archipelago (Review) | author=Anon | journal=The Ladies' Repository |date=March 1869 | volume=29 | page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AswaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The reviewer notes the region is "of terrific grandeur, parts of it being perpetually illuminated by discharging volcanoes, and all of it frequently shaken with earthquakes." The review summarises the book's geographical reach and style in a paragraph.&lt;ref name=LR/&gt;

====''The Popular Science Review''====

''The Popular Science Review'' began by writing that "We never remember to have taken up a book which gave us more pleasure".&lt;ref name=PopSciRev&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Malayan Archipelago | journal=The Popular Science Review |editor1=Samuelson, James |editor2=Dawson, Henry |editor3=Dallas, William Sweetland | year=1869 | volume=8 | pages=286–287 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mg4KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was quite unlike the dull journey logs of most travel books; it was "a romance, which is, nevertheless, plain matter of fact". The review especially admires the way that Wallace "has generalised on the facts" rather than just shooting "a multitude of birds" and interminably describing them. The account notes that Wallace was the joint originator of the theory of natural selection, and summarises the discovery of the Wallace line in some detail. The review ends by placing the ''Malay Archipelago'' between [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] ''[[Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name=PopSciRev/&gt;

====''American Quarterly Church Review''====
[[File:Malay Archipelago Bird of Paradise shooting.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|"Natives of Aru shooting the great bird of paradise"]]
The ''American Quarterly Church Review'' admires Wallace's bravery in going alone among the "barbarous races" in a "villainous climate" with all the hardships of travel, and his hard work in skinning, stuffing, drying and bottling so many specimens. Since "As a scientific man he follows Darwin" the review finds "his theories sometimes need as many grains of salt as his specimens." But the review then agrees that the book will "make the world wiser about its more solitary and singular children, hid away over the seas", and opines that no-one will mind paying the price of the book to read about the birds of paradise, "those bird-angels, with flaming wings of crimson and gold and scarlet, who twitter and gambol and make merry among the great island trees, while the Malay hunts for them with his blunt-headed arrows..." The review concludes that the book is a fresh and valuable record of "a remote and romantic land".&lt;ref name=AQCR&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=bwMFAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Malay Archipelago (Review) | author=Anon | journal=American Quarterly Church Review |date=January 1870 | volume=21 | issue=4 | pages=610–611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Australian Town and Country Journal''====

The ''Australian Town and Country Journal'' begins by stating that&lt;ref name=AusTCJ&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70457369 | title=Literature: Review: The Malay Archipelago | author=Anon | journal=Australian Town and Country Journal |date=January 1870 | volume=4 | pages=18a–18b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Mr. Wallace is generally understood to be the originator of the theory of "[[Natural Selection]]" as propounded by Mr. Darwin, and certainly .. he brings numerous phenomena which he regards as illustrative of that theory very vividly under the notice of his readers, and that, too, as if he were but a disciple of Mr. Darwin, and not an original discoverer.|&lt;ref name=AusTCJ/&gt;}}

and quickly makes clear that it objects to Wallace's doubts about "indications of design" in plants. Despite this "grave" fault, the reviewer considers the book to be of immense value, and that it would become a standard work on the region.&lt;ref name=AusTCJ/&gt; The review quotes a paragraph that paints "a picture of country life in the Celebes", where Wallace describes his host, a Mr. M., who relied on his gun to supply his table with wild pigs, deer, and jungle fowl, while enjoying his own milk, butter, rice, coffee, ducks, palm wine and tobacco. However, the Australian reviewer doubted Wallace's judgement about flavours, given that he praised the [[Durian]] fruit, namely that it tastes of custard, cream cheese, onion sauce, brown sherry "and other incongruities", whereas "most Europeans" found it "an abomination".&lt;ref name=AusTCJ/&gt;

Otherwise, the review notes that Wallace seemed to have enjoyed his time in the Celebes, with the hornbills flapping past, and the baboons staring down from their trees, and enjoys his enthusiasm for the [[birds of paradise]]. The review is respectful of his account of the Wallace line, having no difficulty agreeing that the Australian-type vegetation continues into the archipelago as far as Lombok and Celebes. It concludes that he covers almost every natural phenomenon he came across "with the accuracy and discriminating sagacity of an accomplished naturalist", and explains that the "great charm" of the book is "a truthful simplicity" which inspires confidence.&lt;ref name=AusTCJ/&gt;

====''Calcutta Review''====

[[File:The Museum, Chowringhee.jpg|thumb|[[Indian Museum|The Indian Museum, Calcutta]]]]
The ''Calcutta Review'' starts by noting that this is a book that cannot be done justice in a brief notice, that Wallace is a most eminent naturalist, and chiefly known as a Darwinian. the book was the most interesting to cross the reviewer's desk since [[William Gifford Palgrave|Palgrave]]'s ''Arabia'' (1865) and Sir [[Samuel Baker]]'s ''Explorations of the Nile'' (1866). By combining geography, geology and ethnology into one narrative, the reader is saved "the monotony of traversing the same regions several times". The review describes in detail Wallace's findings of different birds and mammals either side of the Wallace line. It notes Wallace's cheerfulness and good temper in the face of "the difficulties and inconveniences attendant upon foreign travel", such as having to cross "a hundred miles of open sea in a little boat of four tons burthen",&lt;ref&gt;The review is citing Wallace, 1869. Volume 2, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; which Wallace calmly describes as comparatively comfortable. The reviewer remarks that Wallace was "set down as a conjuror by these simple people" with unimaginable purposes from a faraway country, but is less admiring about Wallace's moralising tone, especially when he supposes that "wild communities" can be happier than "in a more highly civilised society". The review ends with some reflections of surprise on how little-known the Malay Archipelago is in India, given that they were closely connected with [[Prambanan|Hindu temples in Java]] and [[Balinese Hinduism|Bali]], and hopes that soon there will be some "productions" of the archipelago in the [[Indian Museum]] of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKigAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR23 | title=Literature: The Malay Archipelago | journal=Calcutta Review|year=1869|volume=49|issue=The Quarter|pages=xxiii–xxvii|author=Anon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Revue des Deux Mondes''====

The book's fame spread beyond the English-speaking world. R. Radau wrote a lengthy review of ''Un naturaliste dans l'Archipel Malais'' in the French ''Revue des Deux Mondes''. Radau notes the many deaths from volcanic eruptions in the archipelago, before explaining the similarity of the fauna of Java and Sumatra with that of central Asia, while that of the Celebes carries the mark of Australia, seeming to be the last representatives of another age. Radau describes Wallace's experiences in Singapore, where goods were far cheaper than in Europe – wire, knives, corkscrews, gunpowder, writing-paper, and he remarks on the spread of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] into the interior, though the missionaries had to live on just 750 francs a year. Singapore was covered in wooded hills, and the sawn wood and rotten trunks supported innumerable beetles for the naturalist to study. The only disagreeable element was that the tigers that roared in the forest devoured on average one Chinese per day, especially in the ginger plantations.&lt;ref name=Revue&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYsFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA675 | title=Un naturaliste dans l'Archipel Malais | author=Radau, R | journal=Revue des Deux Mondes (Paris) | year=1869 | volume=83 | issue=2 | pages=675–706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radau summarises one passage from the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull themselves upwards; the indescribable taste of a [[durian]] fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry and a host of other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run [[amok]], generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.&lt;ref name=Revue/&gt;

Radau returns to food, describing sago and the breadfruit tree. The breadfruit tastes like [[Yorkshire pudding]] or mashed potato; with meat it is the best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or molasses, it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes that perhaps it will one day be found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed a man for a year.&lt;ref name=Revue/&gt;

There is torrential rain; there are savages; there are dangerous trips in small boats. Only in the final paragraph does Radau reflect on it all: "We have tried, in this study on Wallace's two volumes, to give an idea of what he saw in his eight year stay in the Far East." He admits he has left out most of the natural history, and regrets not having space for more "charming pages" which would have taken him too far. He joins Wallace in reflecting on the relative state of "civilized" and "savage", wondering which is morally superior, and notes the "nostalgia for the primitive state", concluding that civilisation brings the benefit of reason to restrain hasty action.&lt;ref name=Revue/&gt;

====''The Guardian''====

[[File:Malay Archipelago Chief's House and Rice-shed in a Sumatran Village.jpg|thumb|"[[Rumah adat|Chief's House and Rice-shed]] in a Sumatran Village", by E.W. Robinson]]
Tim Radford, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref name=Radford&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jan/11/malay-archipelago-alfred-russel-wallace-review?INTCMP=SRCH | title=The Malay Archipelago by Alfred Russel Wallace – review | publisher=The Guardian | date=11 January 2013 | accessdate=13 March 2013 | author=Radford, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; considers that ''The Malay Archipelago'' shows Wallace to be "an extraordinary figure", since he is

{{quote|an adventurer who does not present himself as adventurous; he is a Victorian Englishman abroad with all the self-assurance but without the lordly superiority of the coloniser; he is the chronicler of wonders who refuses to exaggerate, or to believe anybody else's improbable marvels: what he can see and examine (and, very often, shoot) is wonder enough for him.|Tim Radford&lt;ref name=Radford/&gt;}}

Radford finds "delights on every page", such as the [[Wallace line]] between the islands of Bali and Lombok; the sparkling observations, like "the river bed 'a mass of pebbles, mostly pure white quartz, but with abundance of jasper and agate'"; the detailed but lively accounts of natural history and physical geography; the respectful and friendly attitude to the native peoples such as the hill Dyaks of [[Borneo]]; and his unclouded observations of human society, such as the way a [[Bugis]] man in Lombok runs [[amok]], where Wallace&lt;ref name=Radford/&gt;

====''The Observer''====

[[Image:Wallace frog.jpg|thumb |upright |The [[Rhacophorus nigropalmatus|flying frog]] of Borneo |alt=Engraving of a frog]]
Robin McKie, in ''[[The Observer]]'',&lt;ref name=McKie&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/19/malay-archipelago-alfred-russel-wallace | title=Classics corner: Malay Archipelago | publisher=The Observer | date=19 April 2009 | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=McKie, Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that the common view of Wallace "as a clever, decent cove who knew his place" as second fiddle to [[Charles Darwin]] is rather lopsided. Wallace, he writes, is "capable of great insights" in the ''Malay Archipelago''. Travelling over 14,000 miles and collecting 125,000 specimens, he also made "scrupulous notes" for the book which

{{quote|subtly combines wildlife descriptions, geological musings and tales about the villagers, merchants and sultans he encountered on his travels through the East Indies.|Robin McKie&lt;ref name=McKie/&gt;}}

In McKie's view, Wallace was a gifted writer with "an eye for catchy observation", and this is one of the finest of travel books. McKie liked the account of Wallace's night sleeping "'with half-a-dozen smoke-dried human skulls suspended over my head'".&lt;ref name=McKie/&gt;

====In research====

The researcher Charles Smith rates the ''Malay Archipelago'' as "Wallace's most successful work, literarily and commercially", placing it second only to his ''Darwinism'' (1889) among his books for academic citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/cited.htm | title=Wallace's Most Cited Works | publisher=Western Kentucky University | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=Smith, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on other works==

''The Malay Archipelago'' influenced many works starting with those of Wallace's contemporaries. The novelist [[Joseph Conrad]] used it as source material for some of his novels, including ''[[Almayer's Folly]]'', ''[[An Outcast of the Islands]]'', and ''[[The Rescue (Conrad novel)|The Rescue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Slotten | first = Ross A.| title = The Heretic in Darwin's Court: the life of Alfred Russel Wallace | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-231-13010-3 | pages=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators have suggested it had a particularly profound influence on ''[[Lord Jim]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Rosen | first=Jonathen | title=Missing Link: Alfred Russel Wallace, Charles Darwin's neglected double | url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2007/02/12/070212crat_atlarge_rosen | publisher=The New Yorker Feb 2007 | accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; crediting it with among other things the inspiration for the character Stein the [[entomologist]].&lt;ref name=Raby/&gt; Conrad's assistant [[Richard Curle]] wrote that ''The Malay Archipelago'' was Conrad's favourite bedside book;&lt;ref name=Raby&gt;{{cite book | author=Raby, Peter | title=Wallace's Literary Legacy | work=Natural Selection and Beyond: The Intellectual Legacy of Alfred Russell Wallace | year=2008 |editor1=Charles H.

Somerset Maugham]] has the title character read ''The Malay Archipelago'' while travelling to [[Borneo]], and its influence can be felt in the story's description of that island.&lt;ref name=Raby/&gt;

More recently, the book has influenced a number of non-fiction books including ''The Song of the Dodo'' by [[David Quammen]] (1997), which discussed Wallace's contributions to the field of [[island biogeography]];&lt;ref&gt;Quammen, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/1996/april/book_apr96.php | title=Review of 'The Song of the Dodo' | publisher=Smithsonian Magazine | accessdate=4 May 2007 | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Spice Islands Voyage'' by [[Tim Severin]] (1997) that retraced Wallace's travels;&lt;ref&gt;Severin, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Archipelago: The Islands of Indonesia'', by [[Gavan Daws]] (1999), which compared the environment described by Wallace with the modern state of the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;Daws, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Malay Archipelago'' is considered to be one of the most influential books ever written about the Indonesian islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.papuaweb.org/dlib/bk/wallace/archipelago.html | title=Preface to the Papuaweb illustrated edition | publisher=PapuaWeb Project | accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains a resource for modern authors of works about the region such as the 2014 book ''Indonesia Etc'', which contains multiple quotations from Wallace's book as well as recommending it as further reading on the geography of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Indonesia Etc: Exploring the Improbable Nation |author= Elizabeth Pisani | year=2014 | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English comedian [[Bill Bailey]] travelled around Indonesia in the footsteps of Wallace for a two-part television programme on BBC Two, first broadcast in 2013, the [[Alfred Russel Wallace centenary|centenary of Wallace's death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0160nxk | title=Bill Bailey's Jungle Hero | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | year=2013 | accessdate=3 April 2013 | author=Bailey, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ULAS&amp;nbsp;J003402.77-005206.7''' (also '''ULAS J0034-00''') is a [[T-type star|T-type]] [[brown dwarf]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Cetus (constellation)|Cetus]].&lt;ref name=sb0 /&gt;

ULAS J0034-00 is one of the coolest brown dwarfs known.  It was first identified in data from the UK Infrared Telescope ([[UKIRT]]) Infrared
Deep Sky Survey ([[UKIDSS]]).  Infrared spectra subsequently taken with the IRS instrument on the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] give an estimated effective temperature of between 550 and 600 [[Kelvin|K]] and does not emit any visible light.  Its mass is estimated at between 5 and 20 [[Jupiter mass]]es and its age at between 0.1 and 2.0 billion years.&lt;ref name=four600k&gt;The Physical Properties of Four ~600 K T Dwarfs, S. K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9751">'''Value of information''' (VOI or VoI) is the amount a decision maker would be willing to pay for information prior to making a decision.

==Similar terms==
VoI is sometimes distinguished into '''value of perfect information''', also called '''value of [[clairvoyance]] (VoC)''', and '''value of imperfect information'''.  They are closely related to the widely known [[expected value of perfect information]] and [[expected value of sample information]].  Note that VoI is not necessarily equal to "value of decision situation with perfect information" - "value of current decision situation" as commonly understood.

==Definitions==

===Simple ===

A simple example best illustrates the concept.  Consider the decision situation with one decision, for example deciding on a ''''Vacation Activity''''; and one uncertainty, for example what will the ''''Weather Condition'''' be?  But we will only know the ''''Weather Condition'''' after we have decided and begun the ''''Vacation Activity''''.
:* The Value of perfect information on ''Weather Condition'' captures the value of being able to know ''Weather Condition'' even before making the ''Vacation Activity'' decision.  It is quantified as the highest price the decision-maker is willing to pay for being able to know ''Weather Condition'' before making the ''Vacation Activity'' decision.
:*The Value of imperfect information on ''Weather Condition'', however, captures the value of being able to know the outcome of another related uncertainty, e.g., ''Weather Forecast'', instead of ''Weather Condition'' itself before making ''Vacation Activity'' decision.  It is quantified as the highest price the decision-maker is willing to pay for being able to know ''Weather Forecast'' before making ''Vacation Activity'' decision.  Note that it is essentially the value of perfect information on ''Weather Forecast''.

===Formal ===

The above definition illustrates that the value of imperfect information of any uncertainty can always be framed as the value of perfect information, i.e., VoC, of another uncertainty, hence only the term VoC will be used onwards.

[[Rationality]] assumption in standard individual decision-making philosophy states that what is made or known are not forgotten, i.e., decision-has [[perfect recall]].  This assumption translates into the existence of a linear ordering of these decisions and uncertainties such that;

:*''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is made prior to making ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' if and only if ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' comes before ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the ordering
:*''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is made prior to knowing ''u&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' if and only if ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' comes before ''u&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the ordering
:*''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is made after knowing ''u&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' if and only if ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' comes after ''u&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the ordering

Consider  cases where the decision-maker is enabled to know the outcome of some additional uncertainties earlier in his/her decision situation, i.e., some ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are moved to appear earlier in the ordering.  In such case, VoC is quantified as the highest price which the decision-maker is willing to pay for all those moves.

====Generalized ====

The standard then is further generalized in [[team theory|team decision analysis]] framework where there is typically incomplete sharing of information among team members under the same decision situation.  In such case, what is made or known might not be known in later decisions belonging to different team members, i.e., there might not exist linear ordering of decisions and uncertainties satisfying perfect recall assumption.  VoC thus captures the value of being able to know "not only additional uncertainties but also additional decisions already made by other team members" before making some other decisions in the team decision situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kuhn|first=H. W.|title=11. Extensive Games and the Problem of Information|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400881970-012|work=Contributions to the Theory of Games (AM-28), Volume II|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400881970|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

There are two extremely important characteristics of VoI that always hold for any decision situation:

:*The value of information can never be less than zero since the decision-maker can always ignore the additional information and makes decision as if such information is not available.
:*No other information gathering/sharing activities can be more valuable than that quantified by value of clairvoyance.

==Computation==

VoC is derived strictly following its definition as the monetary amount that is big enough to just offset the additional benefit of getting more information.  In other words; VoC is calculated iteratively until

::"value of decision situation with perfect information while paying VoC" = "value of current decision situation".

A special case is when the decision-maker is [[risk neutral]] where VoC can be simply computed as

::VoC = "value of decision situation with perfect information" - "value of current decision situation".

This special case is how [[expected value of perfect information]] and [[expected value of sample information]] are calculated where [[risk neutral]]ity is implicitly assumed.  For cases where the decision-maker is [[risk averse]] or [[risk seeking]], this simple calculation does not necessarily yield the correct result, and iterative calculation is the only way to ensure correctness.

[[Decision tree]]s and [[influence diagram]]s are most commonly used in representing and solving decision situations as well as associated VoC calculation.  The influence diagram, in particular, is structured to accommodate team decision situations where incomplete sharing of information among team members can be represented and solved very efficiently.  While decision trees are not designed to accommodate team decision situations, they can do so by augmenting them with [[information set (game theory)|information set]]s widely used in [[game tree]]s.

==Examples==

VoC is often illustrated using the example of paying for a consultant in a business transaction, who may either be perfect ([[expected value of perfect information]]) or imperfect (expected value of imperfect information).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Total-Information-Risk-Management-Maximizing/dp/0124055478/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1532294997&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=value+of+information|title=Total Information Risk Management: Maximizing the Value of Data and Information Assets|last=results|first=search|last2=Parlikad|first2=Ajith Kumar|last3=results|first3=search|last4=results|first4=search|date=2013-10-02|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=9780824788896|edition= 1st|location=New York, NY|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical consultant situation, the consultant would be paid up to cost ''c'' for their information, based on the expected cost ''E'' without the consultant and the revised cost ''F'' with the consultant's information. In a perfect information scenario, ''E'' can be defined as the sum product of the probability of a good outcome ''g'' times its cost ''k'', plus the probability of a bad outcome (1-''g'') times its cost ''k''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'&gt;k:

''E'' = ''gk'' + ''(1-g)k',''

which is revised to reflect expected cost ''F'' of perfect information including consulting cost ''c''. The perfect information case assumes the bad outcome does not occur due to the perfect information consultant.

''F'' = ''g(k+c)''

We then solve for values of ''c'' for which ''F&lt;E'' to determine when to pay the consultant.

In the case of a recursive [[decision tree]], we often have an additional cost ''m'' that results from correcting the error, and the process restarts such that the expected cost will appear on both the left and right sides of our equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Value-Information-Methodological-Applications-Environment/dp/9400798083/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1532294997&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=value+of+information|title=The Value of Information: Methodological Frontiers and New Applications in Environment and Health|date=2014-09-21|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789400798083|editor-last=Laxminarayan|editor-first=Ramanan|edition= 2012 |location=Place of publication not identified|language=English|editor-last2=Macauley|editor-first2=Molly K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typical of hiring-rehiring decisions or value chain decisions for which assembly line components must be replaced if erroneously ordered or installed:

''E'' =  ''gk'' + ''(1-g)(k'+m+E)''

''F'' = ''g(k+c)''

If the consultant is imperfect with frequency ''f'', then the consultant cost is solved with the probability of error included:

''F'' = ''g(k+c)(1-f) + g(k+c+F)f + (1-g)(1-f)(k+c+F) + (1-g)f(k'+c+m+F)''
