'''Adloyada'''  ([[Hebrew]]: '''עדלאידע''' or '''עדלידע''', lit. "Until one no longer knows") is a humorous procession held in [[Israel]] on the [[Jewish holidays|Jewish holiday]] of [[Purim]] (or in [[Shushan Purim]] the second day of Purim, commanded to be celebrated in "walled cities", nowadays only in [[Jerusalem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/purim/article_cdo/aid/645278/jewish/Walled-Cities.htm|title=Shushan Purim - Why Jerusalem celebrates a day later|website=www.chabad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adloyada parade is a tradition dating back to the early days of [[Tel Aviv]], in 1912. During the days of the [[Yishuv]], the Adloyada was a mass event; it was resumed after the state of Israel was established.

The name is derived from the rabbinic saying in the [[Megillah (Talmud)|Talmud]] that one should revel on Purim by drinking "until one no longer knows" (''ad de-lo yada'', [[Aramaic]]: עַד דְּלָא יָדַע) the difference between "blessed be [[Mordecai]]" and "cursed be [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ADLOYADA|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0001_0_00472.html}}[[Jewish Virtual Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meg7b&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf|title=Meg. 7b|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoshana Kordova, [http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/word-of-the-day-adloyada.premium-1.504852 Word of the Day Adloyada], ''[[Haaretz]]'', February 21, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Adloyada 1956.jpg|thumb|left|"[[David Ben-Gurion]]" and "[[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]" in the 1956 ''Adloyada'' parade in [[Tel Aviv]] ]]

[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - A HUGE DOLL IN THE FIGURE OF DAVID BEN GURION, PARTICIPATING IN THE ADLOYADA PARADE.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Ben-Gurion]] float at the ''Adloyada'' parade, 1998]]
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 12251 purim festival in holon 2011.jpg|thumb|left|''Adloyada'' carnival in [[Holon]], 2011]]

The first Adloyada parade was initiated by [[Avraham Aldema]], a teacher and co-founder of "[[Hevre Trasek]]", and was held in [[Tel Aviv]] during Purim in 1912. This parade was characterized by provocative costumes and pranks. According to several testimonies, the parade of 1912 was very colorful and beautiful. It consisted of giant puppets, a marching band and hundreds of children wearing their Purim costumes. Throughout the years, the parade became a permanent tradition of Purim. These events were held parallel to the famous celebrations that were organized by [[Baruch Agadati]]. Agadati's merriments had become extremely profitable, and so were criticized harshly by "Hevre Trasek" for being over commercialized.

Tel Aviv's Adloyadas were complemented with luxurious Purim [[Ball (dance)|balls]], created by Baruch Agadati. Throughout the years, the parades were expanded and their path was moved from [[Theodor Herzl|Herzl]] Street to [[Allenby Street]] and to [[Ibn Gabirol Street]] upon the establishment of the state of [[Israel]].

During the 1930s, every Adloyada had a specific theme, for example the [[tribes of Israel]] (in 1934), and the achievements of the [[Yishuv]]. During that time, [[Tel Aviv]]'s Purim events attracted many tourists from all around Israel and from abroad.

As opposed to [[European states]], where carnivals were a means to break loose and consisted of extreme licentiousness, aggressiveness and protest, the Tel Aviv event had different features. The main carnival, despite its new name ''Adloyada'', was characterized by a "proper" behavior. The municipality issued annual limitations on the Purim celebrations such as a prohibition to use [[explosives]] and dress up in costumes that may offend the [[Jewish religion]] or the Israeli nation. Despite the censorship and the sanctions, there were a few costumes and parades that didn't obey the rules and used the public festivity to express social protest, and thus made their mark on the city.

During the 1928 carnival, with the theme "10 years to the national home", Hevre Trasek presented a 10-candle [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] (as a symbol to Balfour's statement); instead of candles there was a rude gesture and the sign "free Aliya, Jews in the top clerical work". In one of the "Menorah" balls (Menorah was a club founded by veterans) in 1927, [[Avraham Atkind]] won the costume competition for his costume: "balancing the clerk's salary in the Palestine government". Atkind's hat had a scale and a photograph of the residence of the British commissioner in the magnificent [[Augusta Victoria Hospital|Augusta Victoria]] building in [[Mount Scopus]], as well as a poem, expressing the discontent of the gap between the British clerk's salary and the salaries of local Israelis from all ethnic groups.

[[Gdud Meginei Hasafa]] (Hebrew: גדוד מגיני השפה, [[Battalion for the Defence of the Language]]), an organization in Tel Aviv fighting to make Hebrew the common language in [[Mandatory Palestine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://via.lib.harvard.edu/via/deliver/deepcontent?recordId=olvwork464392 |title=Legion of the Defenders of the Language |website= Harvard University Library |publisher= President and Fellows of Harvard College |accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/archive/Pages/gmh.aspx |language= Hebrew |title= גדוד מגיני השפה |trans-title=Battalion of Defenders of the Language|publisher= The Academy of the Hebrew Language, האקדמיה ללשון העברית |accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; used Purim to present and to flood the streets with written propaganda. The Gdud documents were distributed during the Purim carnival. In addition, the Gdud held an annual costume competition with the theme of the superiority and importance of the [[Hebrew]] language. In the carnival of 1929, the Gdud presented the "tower of [[Babylon]]"; a tower on top of a horse-drawn cart with the slogan "revival of the language, revival of the people" and "words can kill".

In the main carnival of 1933, there was a puppet of [[Hitler]] riding a horse, as part of the parade. On its neck there was a sign saying; "kill Jews" and next to it there were 2 Jews bleeding to death.  The German consul in Jerusalem sent a letter to Tel Aviv Mayor [[Meir Dizengoff]] in the matter and demanded an apology, but Dizengoff replied that Purim is a stage for free speech of public opinion. A year later, a huge puppet was presented with a [[swastika]] on its back. 

In 1935, a giant puppet was built, named "the profiteering monster". On the day of festivities, a public trial was held for the puppet, during which Dizengoff, [[Menachem Ussishkin]], [[Chaim Weizmann]] and [[Yehoshua Hankin]] ruled that the monster was guilty of various crimes including fraud, spending the people's wealth, and destruction of the achievements of the pioneers.

In one of the later carnivals, a group of people dressed as [[Ku Klux Klan]] members in order to protest racism in the [[United States]].

While Purim festivals became central public events in the 1920s and 1930s for expressing current social issues, the holiday events, overall and despite exceptions, were aimed to strengthen national messages and dominant ideologies. As opposed to its Biblical origin, where Purim constitutes "an opposite world" (the fool becomes the king and the king is presented as a fool around town), in [[Tel Aviv]] the holiday was institutionalized to conserve the social hierarchy and the parades were led by the city's mayor [[Meir Dizengoff]], astride a horse.

During the [[Second World War]], the Adloyada tradition was extinguished.

==After the establishment of the State of Israel==
The Adloyada tradition was renewed in the Purim of 1955. In the late sixties, the tradition disintegrated in Tel Aviv and the parade was transferred to [[Holon]], although it lacked the unrefined feature of events in the small [[Tel Aviv]].

In the 80’s an [[ArchiParhiTura]] (also spelled ArchiParchiTura; Hebrew: ארכיפרחיטורה) was introduced in [[Haifa]]. It was a Purim parade which had giant displays made by [[Technion]] architecture students ("ArchiParhiTura" is the Hebrew combination of the words architecture and "archi parhi"- which is the biblical expression of vagabond) and set on trucks. The parade went through [[Theodor Herzl|Herzl]] Street in the [[Hadar Hacarmel]] area and was accompanied by an orchestra.

In the last few years, an attempt was made to return to tradition and resume the Adloyada as an important main event in different cities.

==The name ''Adloyada''==
In the beginning, the parade was called "carnival". In 1923, a competition was held in order to find a new permanent name for the parade. Out of 300 submissions, author [[Isaac Dov Berkowitz]]'s entry ''Adloyada'' was chosen. 

Adloyada means reaching a state of total intoxication. The expression comes from the Aramaic expression stated by [[Rabbah bar Nahmani|Rabbah]] in the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Megilla: "It is the duty of a man to mellow himself ... on Purim until he cannot tell the difference between 'cursed be Haman' and 'blessed be Mordecai'." &lt;ref name=Meg7b /&gt; This means that people should drink on Purim until he reaches a state of not being able to distinguish between the evil Haman and the blessed Mordecai.

Among the other submitted suggestions were [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]]'s entry "Pura", [[Shaul Tchernichovsky|Tchernichovsky]]'s entry "Astoret" and [[Avraham Shlonsky]]'s entry "Tzahalula".

The '''Alterans''' are a fictional race in the [[Stargate]] universe that have been portrayed as the first evolution of the Human form, having later ascended into a state of pure energy.  In the timeframe of the television shows, the Alterans are politically divided into two groups; one known primarily as the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]], and the other known as the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]] ([[Stargate SG-1]]), the [[Ancestor (Stargate)|Ancestors]] ([[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]]), and the [[Lanteans (Stargate)|Lanteans]] ([[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]]).  The Alterans are one of the oldest sentient races known in the Stargate universe, and are also considered to be the most technically advanced race there is.

'''''Baptism of Christ''''' is a painting by Italian Renaissance painter [[Cima da Conegliano]], dating from 1492. It is housed in the church of [[San Giovanni in Bragora]] in [[Venice]].

==Description==

The painting portrays Christ at the center of the scene, standing with joined hands. His attitude is that of humble submission to baptism, which is being given him by [[Saint John the Baptist]], who appears on the right.

At the left are three angels with Christ's garments, in red and blue colors, which he will use after the baptism. The scene is completed by an angelic choir in the sky, and a generic oriental city on a spur in the left, behind the angels, while another one is visible in the far background.

'''Bar stools''' are a type of [[stool (seat)|tall chair]], often with a foot rest to support the feet. The height and narrowness of bar stools makes them suitable for use at bars and high tables in [[public house|pub]]s or [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s. 

There are many different types, construction materials and models. Bar stools are often made of wood or metal. There are bar stools with and without armrests, backs, and padding or upholstery on the seat surface. Bar stools can range from basic wooden designs to more complex ones with adjustable height. Extra tall and extra short are common features, as well as indoor bar stools and outdoor bar stools. Some bar stools have backs, while most do not. In commercial settings, swivel and floor mounted bar stools are common. Floor mounting renders the stool immovable, so it cannot be stolen or used as a weapon in a bar fight. Floor-mounted stools generally are mounted on a column, but stools with legs can also be secured to the floor using metal brackets. 

The normal seat height for a bar stool is 30" (76 cm) with a 26" (66 cm) stool being used against kitchen counters. Extra tall 36" (91 cm) stools are increasingly used in contemporary styles with high pub tables to create a visual effect in modern interiors. Counter height bar stools have a seat height of 24" (61cm). By comparison a conventional dining chair seat height is 18" (46 cm).
Some bar stools use [[polyurethane foam]] as padding for comfort {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. Bar stools can be made from rattan or bamboo and these stools can be used to create a [[tiki bar]] effect. The retro styling of the  1950 and 1960s is popular in some bars and restaurants, {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} which use chrome and vinyl stools combined with matching benches or diner chairs. Stacking stools are often favored for their space-saving qualities. Some establishments use matching bar stools and chairs. 

Aluminum is often used outdoors. Stacking aluminum stools and [[Garden furniture|patio chairs]] are used by commercial premises. Indoors, wood and [[upholstery]] are popular in traditional settings. Bar stools are used in pool or [[billiard hall]]s and the style of chair customized for such use is often called a "spectator chair". Bar stools are used in [[Ireland]] during weekends by followers of the English [[Premier League]], a practice which led to the creation of the pejorative term "barstoolers" by supporters of the [[League of Ireland]]. Bar stools are a growth area in the consumer market and online purchasing is on the increase {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. They are becoming a staple of a modern kitchen, and expanding their uses with consumers using DIY to create their own furniture pieces with bar stools. Using bar stools as tables, desks, and even plant holders is growing in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Most Unique Uses of Modern Bar Stools |url=https://www.sohoconcept.com/blog/item/most-unique-uses-of-modern-bar-stools |website=sohoConcept |accessdate=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bar stools can be made to order and customers can specify a wide range of fabrics and finishes as well as specifying other options such as height and custom foot rests. Both wooden and metal bar stools, including stainless and chrome styles and adjustable height features are popular.

A '''Bollenhut''' is a formal headdress worn since {{circa}}1750 by Protestant women as part of their folk costume or ''[[Tracht]]'' in the three neighbouring [[Black Forest]] villages of [[Gutach (Schwarzwaldbahn)|Gutach]], [[Kirnbach (Wolfach)|Kirnbach]] and [[Reichenbach (Hornberg)|Hornberg-Reichenbach]]. With its woollen [[pompom]]s, the picturesque-looking red ''Bollenhut'' has become a symbol of the [[Black Forest]] as a whole, despite its very local origins. The red pom-poms and white brim of the ''Bollenhut'' also is said to have inspired the top layer of the [[Black Forest Cake]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sweets.seriouseats.com/2014/01/know-your-sweets-black-forest-cake.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bollenhut as part of folk costume ==
The broad-brimmed, whitewashed straw hat bears 14 prominent, woollen, pompoms arranged in the shape of a cross. Only eleven pompoms are visible, however, because three are covered by those on top. Unmarried women wear red pompoms, married women wear black, old women and widows wear only the mob cap. The ''Bollenhut'' can weigh up to two kilogrammes and is manufactured by female [[milliner]]s. The red ''Bollenhut'' may first be worn by girls at their [[confirmation]].

A silk [[mob cap]] is worn underneath the ''Bollenhut'', tied under the chin. Young girls before [[confirmation]] (Gutach and several neighbouring parishes were part of [[Württemberg]] until 1804 and were [[Protestant]], unlike the majority of the Black Forest) and old women only wore the mob cap.

Today the ''Bollenhut'' and associated ''Tracht'' are still worn on holidays and for traditional events. The ''Bollenhut'' and local costumes may be seen all year round e.g. in the [[Black Forest Costume Museum]] in [[Haslach im Kinzigtal]].

== Development as a Black Forest symbol ==
In the late 18th century, apart from several mob caps, the ''[[Schühut]]'' and ''[[Gupfhut]]'', which were customary in the County of Hauenstein, were associated with the folk costume of the Black Forest. These types of hats which were known Europe-wide gradually fell out of use by the middle of the 19th century. In 1841 following a study trip through the Black Forest, Théodore Valerio published, through the Fréres Gihaut in Paris, a [[lithograph]] of a couple from [[Hornberg]] wearing their local costume, which showed an early version of the ''Bollenhut'' for the first time in France. After Gutach was connected to the [[Black Forest Railway (Baden)|Baden Black Forest Railway]] in 1873, artists like [[Wilhelm Hasemann]], [[Curt Liebich]] and [[Fritz Reiss]] settled there, forming the "Gutach artists' colony". They portrayed the Gutach costume as an artistic subject, their works were widely distributed and shaped the image of the Black Forest. Like local author, [[Heinrich Hansjakob]], they were part of a movement of Baden folk costume. At the turn of the 20th century, particularly Hasemann's painting, ''After Going To Church'' which showed ''Bollenhut'' wearers, was widely publicized in illustrated magazines and picture postcards.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Heck: ''Ein Hut macht Karriere.''. In: Badisches Landesmuseum Karlsruhe (publ.): ''Baden! 900 Jahre – Geschichten eines Landes.'' Info-Verlag, Karlsruhe, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-937345-56-7}}, p. 256 (Katalog zur Großen Landesausstellung)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fame of the ''Bollenhut'' as (wrongly) generally typical of the Black Forest rose as a result of films of local life (''Heimatfilme'') in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly the 1950 film, ''[[The Black Forest Girl (1950 film)|The Black Forest Girl]]'' (''Schwarzwaldmädel''), with [[Sonja Ziemann]]. This first German colour film of the post war period is one of the most successful German films of all time with an estimated 15 million viewers.

{{Main|History of Brigham Young University}}
[[File:BrighamYoung1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brigham Young]], the school's [[eponym]].]]

=== Early days ===
Brigham Young University's origin can be traced back to 1862 when a man named [[Warren Newton Dusenberry|Warren Dusenberry]] started a Provo school in Cluff Hall, a prominent adobe building in the northeast corner of 200 East and 200 North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = D.

After some financial difficulties the school was recreated in the Kinsey and Lewis buildings on Center street in Provo, and after gaining some recognition for its quality, was adopted to become the Timpanogos branch of the [[University of Deseret]].  When financial difficulty forced another closure, on October 16, 1875, [[Brigham Young]], then [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] of the LDS Church, deeded the property to trustees to create ''Brigham Young Academy'' after earlier hinting a school would be built in Draper, Utah, in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BYU: The "almost" college of Draper, Utah |url=http://www.russpage.net/byu-the-almost-college-of-draper-utah/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021233018/https://www.russpage.net/byu-the-almost-college-of-draper-utah/ |archivedate=October 21, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, October 16, 1875, is commonly held as BYU's founding date.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| title =Brigham Young High School History: 1869 to 1903 - The Founding Years | publisher =Brigham Young High School| url =http://abc.eznettools.net/D300015/X329586/History/HistoryDecades/From1869to1903.html| accessdate = August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; . Brigham Young had been envisioning for several years the concept of a church university &lt;ref&gt;The first hundred years, Ernest L.

The school, however, did not become a university until the end of [[Benjamin Cluff]]'s term at the helm of the institution. At that time, the school was also still privately supported by members of the community and was not absorbed and sponsored officially by the LDS Church until July 18, 1896.&lt;ref name="byhigh"&gt;{{cite web| title =From 1903 to 1920 ~ A High School Within a University| work =Brigham Young High School History| publisher =Brigham Young High School| year= 2007| url =http://www.byhigh.org/History/HistoryDecades/From1903to1920.html| accessdate = August 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of odd managerial decisions by Cluff led to his demotion; however, in his last official act, he proposed to the Board the Academy be named "Brigham Young University". The suggestion received a large amount of opposition, with many members of the Board saying the school wasn't large enough to be a university, but the decision ultimately passed. One opponent to the decision, Anthon H. Lund, later said, "I hope their head will grow big enough for their hat."&lt;ref name = wilk/&gt;

In 1903 Brigham Young Academy was dissolved, and was replaced by two institutions: [[Brigham Young High School]], and Brigham Young University.&lt;ref name="byhigh"/&gt; The BY High School class of 1907 was ultimately responsible for the [[hillside letters|famous giant "Y"]] that is to this day [[Y Mountain|embedded on a mountain]] near campus.&lt;ref name="byhigh"/&gt; The Board elected [[George H. Brimhall]] as the new President of BYU. He had not received a high school education until he was forty. Nevertheless, he was an excellent orator and organizer.&lt;ref name = wilk/&gt; Under his tenure in 1904 the new Brigham Young University bought {{convert|17|acre|m2}} of land from Provo called "Temple Hill".&lt;ref name="byhigh"/&gt; After some controversy among locals over BYU's purchase of this property, construction began in 1909 on the first building on the current campus, the Karl G.

The religious nature of the school seemed at the time to collide with this scientific theory. [[Joseph F. Smith]], LDS Church president, settled the question for a time by asking that evolution not be taught at the school. A few have described the school at this time as nothing more than a "religious seminary". However, many of its graduates at this time would go on to great success and become well renowned in their fields.&lt;ref name = wilk/&gt;

=== Expansion ===
[[File:Smoot Building.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Abraham O. Smoot Administration Building]]
[[Franklin S. Harris]] was appointed the university's president in 1921. He was the first BYU president to have a doctoral degree. Harris made several important changes to the school, reorganizing it into a true university, whereas before, its organization had remnants of the Academy days. At the beginning of his tenure, the school was not officially recognized as a university by any accreditation organization. By the end of his term, the school was accredited under all major accrediting organizations at the time. He was replaced by [[Howard S. McDonald]], who received his doctorate from the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]]. When he first received the position, the [[Second World War]] had just ended, and thousands of students were flooding into BYU. By the end of his stay, the school had grown nearly five times to 5,440 students. The university did not have the facilities to handle such a large influx, so he bought part of an Air Force Base in [[Ogden, Utah]] and rebuilt it to house some of the students.&lt;ref name = wilk/&gt; The next president, [[Ernest L. Wilkinson]], also oversaw a period of intense growth, as the school adopted an accelerated building program. Wilkinson was responsible for the building of over eighty structures on the campus, many of which still stand.&lt;ref name=ernest&gt;{{cite web| title =Ernest L.

[[Dallin H. Oaks]] replaced Wilkinson as president in 1971. Oaks continued the expansion of his predecessor, adding a law school and proposing plans for a new School of Management. During his administration, a new library was also added, doubling the library space on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Dallin H.

Holland]] followed as president in 1980, encouraging a combination of educational excellence and religious faith at the university. He believed one of the school's greatest strengths was its religious nature and this should be taken advantage of rather than hidden. During his administration, the university added a campus in Jerusalem, now called the [[BYU Jerusalem Center]]. In 1989, Holland was replaced by [[Rex E.

Bateman was responsible for the building of 36 new buildings for the university both on and off campus, including the expansion of the Harold B. Lee Library. He was also one of several key college leaders who brought about the creation of the [[Mountain West Conference]], which BYU's athletics program joined — BYU previously participated in the [[Western Athletic Conference]]. A [[BYU TV|BYU satellite TV network]] also opened in 2000 under his leadership. Bateman was also president during the [[September 11th attacks]] in 2001.

=== Student housing ===
[[File:ForeignLanguageHousing.JPG|thumb|right|Foreign Language Student Residence, where students commit to speak only their language of study]]

Single students who are freshmen have four options for on-campus housing: Heritage Halls, Helaman Halls, Wyview Park, and the Foreign Language Student Residence (FLSR). On-campus married students live in Wymount Terrace or Wyview Park.

Heritage Halls was a twenty-four-building housing complex on campus which offers apartment-style living. It has been replaced by a newer housing complex. The halls house both male and female students, divided by gender into separate buildings. Each building has ten to fourteen units capable of housing six people each.

Helaman Halls is a slightly newer complex which underwent a 12-year renovation between 1991 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Chamberlin| first =Sarah| title =A new home: Helaman Halls construction completed| publisher =BYU Newsnet| date =September 30, 2003| url =http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/45808| accessdate =August 21, 2007| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20031009013606/http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/45808| archivedate =October 9, 2003| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helaman Halls is a nine-building (ninth opened in the summer of 2010), dormitory-style living area. Residents share a room (larger than Heritage Halls) with one other resident, but do not have their own kitchen and use shared bathrooms. Residents are required to have a meal plan, and eat at the newly remodeled Commons at the Cannon Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byu.edu/oncampushousing/rooms/room_options.shtml|title=BYU On-Campus Housing: Room Options|date=October 23, 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071228065028/http://www.byu.edu/oncampushousing/rooms/room_options.shtml#helaman|archivedate=December 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyview Park was originally built for families in 1996, but this changed in 2006 when the complex began housing single students in order to counteract loss of singles' housing in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Schaerr| first =Stephanie| title =Single Students Move in to Wyview| publisher =BYU Newsnet| date =September 5, 2006| url =http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/60723| accessdate =August 21, 2007| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071118203500/http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/60723| archivedate =November 18, 2007| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wyview Park has 30 buildings that offer apartment-style living for students, along with the option for shared or single rooms.

The Foreign Language Student Residence complex has twenty-five apartments where students speak exclusively in a selected foreign language. The immersion experience is available in nine languages, and students are accompanied by a native resident throughout the year to enhance the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =BYU Housing - FLSR Info| publisher =Brigham Young University| url =http://flsr.byu.edu/about.php| accessdate =August 21, 2007| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070808034637/http://flsr.byu.edu/about.php| archive-date =August 8, 2007| dead-url =yes| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Married students can house in Wymount Terrace, which contains a total of 462 apartments in 24 buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Wymount Terrace, 1960s| work =BYU Campus Photographs| publisher =Brigham young University| url =http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/BYUPhotos&amp;CISOPTR=692&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=3| accessdate = August 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branches of the [[BYU Creamery]] provide basic food and general grocery products for students living in Heritage Halls, Helaman, Wymount, Wyview, and the FLSR.

BYU has designated energy conservation, products and materials, recycling, site planning and building design, student involvement, transportation, water conservation, and zero waste events as top priority categories in which to further its efforts to be an environmentally sustainable campus. The university has stated "we have a responsibility to be wise stewards of the earth and its resources."&lt;ref name="Y Facts - Sustainability"&gt;{{cite web| title =Y Facts - Sustainability| publisher =Brigham Young University| url =http://sustainability.byu.edu| accessdate = March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BYU is working to increase the energy efficiency of its buildings by installing various speed drives on all pumps and fans, replacing incandescent lighting with fluorescent lighting, retrofitting campus buildings with low-E reflective glass, and upgraded roof insulation to prevent heat loss.&lt;ref name="Energy Conservation"&gt;{{cite web

Brigham Young University is a part of the LDS [[Church Educational System]]. It is organized under a [[Board of Trustees]], with the President of the Church (currently [[Russell M. Nelson]]) as chairman.  This board consists of the same people as the Church Board of Education, a pattern that has been in place since 1939.  Prior to 1939, BYU had a separate board of trustees that was subordinate to the Church Board of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Ernest L., ''Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years''. (Provo: BYU Press, 1975) Vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  The President of BYU, currently [[Kevin J Worthen]], reports to the Board, through the Commissioner of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Administration| publisher =Brigham Young University| url =http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2007-2008ucat/pdfportions/103admin.pdf| accessdate =July 25, 2007| format =PDF| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927051805/http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2007-2008ucat/pdfportions/103admin.pdf| archivedate =September 27, 2007| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Devotionals and forums ===
To provide students with opportunities for both spiritual and intellectual insight, BYU has hosted weekly devotional and forum assemblies since the school's early days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://speeches.byu.edu/posts/the-history-of-byu-speeches/|title=The History of BYU Speeches - BYU Speeches|work=BYU Speeches|access-date=February 21, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devotionals are most common and address religious topics, often with academic perspective or insight. Devotional speakers are typically drawn from the BYU faculty and administration or LDS Church leadership, including church presidents George Albert Smith, Spencer W. Kimball, and  Russell M. Nelson.

Several times each year the devotional is replaced by a forum, which typically addresses a more secular topic and may include a speaker from outside the BYU or LDS community. In recent years, forum speakers have included notable politicians (e.g. Joseph Lieberman, Mitt Romney), scientists (Neil deGrasse Tyson, DJ Patil), historians (David McCullough,  Richard Beeman), religious leaders (Archbishop Charles Chaput, Albert Mohler), judicial figures (John Roberts, Thomas Griffith) and other thought leaders (Liz Wiseman, Arthur Brooks).

Although attendance is not required, several thousand students attend the weekly assemblies, which are also broadcast on BYUtv&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.byutv.org/show/723af06e-99dd-46f4-beff-9abbe91593f2/byu-devotional-address]&lt;/ref&gt; and archived in text, audio, and video formats on the BYU Speeches website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://speeches.byu.edu BYU Speeches]&lt;/ref&gt;

A few special additions enhance the language-learning experience. For example, BYU's [http://ic.byu.edu/ International Cinema], featuring films in several languages, is the largest and longest-running university-run foreign film program in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us |work=BYU International Cinema |publisher=Brigham Young University |url=http://ic.byu.edu/about_us.php |accessdate=August 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818213910/http://ic.byu.edu/about_us.php |archivedate=August 18, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As already noted, BYU also offers an intensive foreign language living experience, the Foreign Language Student Residence.  This is an on-campus apartment complex where students commit to speak only their chosen foreign language while in their apartments. Each apartment has at least one native speaker to ensure correct language usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Room Options| publisher =Brigham Young University| url =http://www.byu.edu/oncampushousing/rooms.html| accessdate = August 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070822224947/http://www.byu.edu/oncampushousing/rooms.html |archivedate = August 22, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic freedom issues ===
{{Main|Academic freedom at Brigham Young University}}
In 1992 the university drafted a new Statement on Academic Freedom,&lt;ref name=acadfree&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on Academic Freedom at BYU |publisher=BYU |date=September 14, 1992 |url=http://fc.byu.edu/opages/reference/academicfreedom.htm |accessdate=January 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204112544/http://fc.byu.edu/opages/reference/academicfreedom.htm |archivedate=February 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifying limitations may be placed upon "expression with students or in public that: (1) contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy; (2) deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders; or (3) violates the [[Brigham Young University Honor Code|Honor Code]] because the expression is dishonest, illegal, unchaste, profane, or unduly disrespectful of others." These restrictions have caused some controversy as several professors have been disciplined according to the then-new rule. The [[American Association of University Professors]] has claimed that "infringements on academic freedom are distressingly common and that the climate for academic freedom is distressingly poor."&lt;ref name=aaupreport&gt;{{cite web| title = Academic Freedom and Tenure |date = September 1, 1997| publisher = [[American Association of University Professors]] | url = http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/27EB0A08-8D25-4415-9E55-8081CC874AC5/0/Brigham.pdf | accessdate = May 25, 2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The newer rules have not affected BYU's accreditation, as the university's chosen accrediting body allows "religious colleges and universities to place limitations on academic freedom so long as they publish those limitations candidly", according to associate academic vice president Jim Gordon.&lt;ref name=NascuOnAcademicFreedom&gt;{{cite web| title = The Issue of Academic Freedom: An Interview with Jim Gordon | publisher = ''BYU Magazine'' | year = 1997| url = http://magazine.byu.edu/?act=view&amp;a=664| accessdate = January 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Association of University Professors|AAUP]]'s concern was not with restrictions on the faculty member's religious expression but with a failure, as alleged by the faculty member and AAUP, that the restrictions had not been adequately specified in advance by BYU: "The AAUP requires that any doctrinal limitations on academic freedom be laid out clearly in writing. We [AAUP] concluded that BYU had failed to do so adequately."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cary Nelson]] (AAUP President), "Praying to the Wrong God" (Subject of massmail message), ''AAUP Online'', 2008 September 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the [[Western Athletic Conference]]. All teams are named the "Cougars", and [[Cosmo the Cougar]] has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the [[The Cougar Song (BYU)|Cougar Fight Song]]. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period.

BYU's stated mission "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and [[Exaltation (LDS Church)|eternal life]]."

Some 97 percent of male BYU graduates and 32 percent of female graduates took a hiatus from their undergraduate studies at one point to serve as [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]]. In October 2012, the LDS Church announced at its general conference that young men could serve a mission after they turn 18 and have graduated from high school, rather than after age 19 under the old policy. Many young men would often attend a semester or two of higher education prior to beginning missionary service. This policy change will likely impact what has been the traditional incoming freshman class at BYU.  Female students may now begin their missionary service anytime after turning 19, rather than age 21 under the previous policy. For young men, a completed full-time mission lasts two years, and for young women it lasts 18 months (older missionaries have varying lengths of missions).&lt;ref name = mission&gt;{{cite web| title = Brigham Young University Reaffirmation of Accreditation 2006 Executive Summary| publisher = BYU

|-
| style="text-align: left;" | — Church Educational System Honor Code Statement&lt;ref name="CESHonorCode" /&gt;
|}

All students and faculty, regardless of religion, are required to agree to adhere to an [[honor code]]. Early forms of the Church Educational System Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the Brigham Young Academy and early school President Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the "Domestic Organization", a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to ensure they were following the school's moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Honor Code was not created until about 1940, and was used mainly for cases of cheating and [[academic dishonesty]].

President Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards. This led to what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol. A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process, and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In certain cases, students and faculty can be expelled or lose tenure.  Both LDS and non-LDS students are required to meet annually with a Church leader to receive an ecclesiastical endorsement for both acceptance and continuance.&lt;ref name=BYUhouse3&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bergera |first1= Gary James |last2= Priddis |first2= Ronald |year= 1985 |chapter= Chapter 3: Standards &amp; the Honor Code |chapter-url= http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=13895 |title= Brigham Young University: A House of Faith |place= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[Signature Books]] |isbn= 0-941214-34-6 |oclc= 12963965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture and activities ===
BYU's social and cultural atmosphere is unique.

BYU's honor code, which all BYU students must agree to follow as a condition of studying at BYU, prohibits the consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and recreational drugs. As mentioned earlier, [[The Princeton Review]] has rated BYU the "#1 stone-cold sober school" in the nation for several years running, an honor which the late LDS Church president [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] had commented on with pride.&lt;ref name = pr/&gt; BYU's 2014 "#1 stone-cold" sober rating marked the 17th year in a row the school had earned that rating. BYU has used this and other honors awarded to the school to advertise itself to prospective students, showing that BYU is proud of the rating. According to the [[Uniform Crime Reports]], incidents of crime in Provo are lower than the national average. Murder is rare, and robberies are about 1/10 the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Provo UT Crime Statistics (2006 Crime Data) |publisher=Areaconnect.com |url=http://provo.areaconnect.com/crime1.htm |accessdate=January 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Business Insider'' rated BYU as the #1 safest college campus in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Loudenback |first=Tanza |url=http://www.businessinsider.co.id/safest-college-campuses-in-america-2016-1/26/ |title=The 25 safest college campuses in America |work=Business Insider |date=January 13, 2016 |accessdate=February 19, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216060401/http://www.businessinsider.co.id/safest-college-campuses-in-america-2016-1/26/ |archivedate=February 16, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chapelle Palatine.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Saracen]] arches and Byzantine mosaics complement each other within the Palatine Chapel]] 

The '''Palatine Chapel''' ({{lang-it|Cappella Palatina}}), is the royal [[chapel]] of the [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] kings of [[Sicily]] situated on the first floor at the center of the [[Palazzo dei Normanni|Palazzo Reale]] in [[Palermo]], southern [[Italy]].

Also referred to as a ''Palace church'' or ''Palace chapel'',{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=125}} it was commissioned by [[Roger II of Sicily]] in 1132 to be built upon an older chapel (now the crypt) constructed around 1080. It took eight years to build, receiving a royal charter the same year, with the [[mosaic]]s being only partially finished by 1143.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=125}} The sanctuary, dedicated to [[Saint Peter]], is reminiscent of a domed [[basilica]]. It has three [[apse]]s, as is usual in [[Byzantine architecture]], with six pointed arches (three on each side of the central nave) resting on recycled classical [[column]]s.

==Mosaics==
[[File:King - Dome interior - Capela Palatina - Palermo - Italy 2015.JPG|thumb|mosaic in the Palatine Chapel]]
The [[mosaic]]s of the Palatine Chapel are of unparalleled elegance as concerns elongated proportions and streaming draperies of figures. They are also noted for subtle modulations of colour and luminance. The oldest are probably those covering the ceiling, the drum, and the dome. The shimmering mosaics of the [[transept]], presumably dating from the 1140s and attributed to Byzantine artists, with an illustrated scene, along the north wall, of St. John in the desert and a landscape of ''Agnus Dei''.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=139}} Below this are five saints, the Greek fathers of the church, St. Gregory of Nissa, St. Gregory the Theologian, St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom and St. Nicholas.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=139}} The three central figures, St. Gregory, St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom, allude to the Orthodox cult known as the Three Hierarchs, which originated fifty years earlier.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=139}} Every composition is set within an ornamental frame, not dissimilar to that used in contemporaneous mosaic [[icon]]s. [[Image:Arabischer Maler der Palastkapelle in Palermo 002.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Roger II of Sicily depicted on the [[muqarnas]] ceiling in an [[Islamic art|Arabic style]].]]

The rest of the mosaics, dated to the 1160s or the 1170s, are executed in a cruder manner and feature [[Latin]] (rather than Greek) inscriptions. Probably a work of local craftsmen, these pieces are more narrative and illustrative than transcendental. A few mosaics have a secular character and represent oriental [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. This may be the only substantial passage of secular Byzantine mosaic extant today.

==Chapel==
[[File:Cappella Palatina in Palermo Sicily.JPG|thumb|Cappella Palatina in Palermo Sicily]]
[[File:Cappella Palatina - sostre.jpg|thumb|[[Muqarnas]], a common element in [[Arabic architecture]]]]
The chapel combines harmoniously a variety of styles: the [[Norman architecture]] and door decor, the  [[Arabic architecture|Arabic arches]] and script adorning the roof, the [[Byzantine]] dome and mosaics. For instance, clusters of four [[eight-pointed star]]s, typical for Muslim design, are arranged on the ceiling so as to form a Christian [[cross]].

Other remarkable features of the chapel include the [[muqarnas]] ceiling, which is spectacular.  The hundreds of facets were painted, notably with many purely ornamental vegetal and [[zoomorphic]] designs but also with scenes of daily life and many subjects that have not yet been explained. Stylistically influenced by Iraqi [[Abbasid Caliphate|'Abbasid art]], these paintings are innovative in their more spatially aware representation of personages and of animals.

The chapel has been considered a union of a Byzantine church sanctuary and a Western basilica nave.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=19}} The sanctuary, is of an "Eastern" artistic nature, while the nave reflects "Western" influences.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=19}}

==Nave==
The nave, constructed under Roger II, did not contain any Christian images.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997b|p=110}} These were added later by Roger II's successors, [[William I of Sicily|William I]] and [[William II of Sicily|William II]].{{sfn|Tronzo|1997b|p=110}} The nave's ceiling consists of Arab, Greek and Latin inscriptions.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=19}}

The frame for the royal throne sets against the west wall of the nave.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=142}} There are six steps leading up to where the throne would be, along with two heraldic lions in two roundels upon the spandrels over the throne frame gabel.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=142}}

==Sanctuary==
[[File:Christ Pantocrator - Capela Palatina - Palermo - Italy 2015.JPG|thumb|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]]]]
As an expression of Norman culture, St. Dionysius and St. Martin are represented in the sanctuary.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=107}} Mosaics are of Byzantine culture in their composition and subjects.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=20}} The apex of the dome consists of the [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]], with rows of angels, prophets, evangelists and saints.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=20}} The Byzantine motif ends abruptly with scenes from Christ's life along the south wall of the southern transept arm, while the north wall consists of warrior saints.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=20}}

==Analysis==
Slobodan Ćurčić considers the ''Palatine Cappella'' a reflection of Middle Byzantine art.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=142}} Illustrating architectural and artistic genius to juxtapose Sicily's "''melting pot''" culture.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=143-144}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2087">'''Columbia Artists Management, Inc.''' ('''CAMI''') is an international talent management [[talent agent|agency]].

==History==
Based in [[New York City]], it was formed in 1930 as Columbia Concerts Corporation by [[Arthur Judson]] and [[William S. Paley]], the then head of the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]], who helped merge seven independent concert bureaus in the United States.

During its existence, CAMI has represented a very large number of active classical artists worldwide, including singers [[Leontyne Price]], [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]], [[Renata Tebaldi]], [[Mario Lanza]], [[Jussi Björling]], [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]], [[Richard Tucker]], [[Paul Robeson]], and [[George London (bass-baritone)|George London]]; pianists [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli]], and [[Van Cliburn]]; violinists [[Jascha Heifetz]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], and [[Tossy Spivakovsky]]; and conductors [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Herbert von Karajan]], and [[Otto Klemperer]].

Composers [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Aaron Copland]] were managed by CAMI when they appeared as performers.

British music commentator [[Norman Lebrecht]] has criticized CAMI and Wilford for what Lebrecht deems to be overly pervasive influence of them on conductor salaries and limited time spent by music directors with orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/01/24/banorm24.xml Norman Lebrecht, "Could Silver Fox, the manager of maestros, be losing his grip?".

The '''culture of Jiangxi''' refers to the culture of the people based in [[Jiangxi]].&lt;ref&gt;许怀林. "江西历史文化特征概说." 江西广播电视大学学报 2 (1999): 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; It has changed greatly over several millenniums, from the land's prehistoric period to its contemporary culture, which incorporates ancient and traditional Chinese culture and modern culture influenced by [[Western culture]].

Geographic situation makes Jiangxi distinguish from its neighbours, as high mountains separate it from [[Zhejiang]] to the east, [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] to the south, [[Hunan]] to the west and [[Yangzi River]] forms a natural division between the South and northern China.

==Language==
{{Main|Gan Chinese}}
Gan Chinese has always played a significant role in Jiangxi culture. The [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese variety]] is spoken mainly in Jiangxi but also in surrounding regions such as [[Hunan]], [[Hubei]], [[Anhui]], and [[Fujian]]. Modern Gan is considered as one of [[Sinitic languages]], which [[History of Gan Chinese|derives from Old Gan]] and still keeps some linguistic traces of ancient languages in [[Northern and southern China|South China]].

Gan Chinese is written in traditional [[Chinese characters]] with Gan variants. Many vocabulary items are no longer used in most Chinese varieties, particularly in Mandarin, while they remain in daily usage in Gan. For example, cooking utensils are called ''[[Wok|uoh]]'' (鑊) or ''[[Ding (vessel)|tiang]]'' (鼎) in Gan which date back to the [[Shang Dynasty]]. The [[Bible]] was also translated into [[List of Chinese Bible translations#Gan Chinese|some Gan dialects]] as the Christianity was introduced into Jiangxi as early as the 16th century, with the arrival of [[Marco Polo]].

==Academy culture==
Since the academy represents the historical and cultural progress in a place, the importance of it gradually increased during the thousands of years in China. In ancient China, Jiangxi had four famous academies and they brought special learning atmosphere to Jiangxi for more than 2000 years.&lt;ref&gt;The academy culture in Jiangxi. Retrieved February 22, 2018, from http://www.lushantravel.com/Jiangxi%20Culture_%E6%B1%9F%E8%A5%BF%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tea culture==
Tea is one of the most famous drink in the world; as a national drink in China, it represents not only the property of drinker but also the inspiration and tradition within the tea. Lushan Yunwu tea, which is named for Lushan Mountain in Jiangxi Province, shows the optimistic and peaceful character of people in Jiangxi.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng Tian. &lt;&lt;文化·大家&gt;&gt; 第34期：江西书院小史&lt;/ref&gt;

====Short story====
Different from the novels, the majority of short stories of Jiangxi closely related to the practice world.
Urbanization beings several topics for writers to discuss how it changes and reforms the structure of society. In addition, the transformation process where traditional concepts are influenced by industrialization is shown in the short stories.&lt;ref&gt;2016年江西文学观察.

Nuo opera, which is said to have some relations with Baiyue culture, is a popular folk opera in Jiangxi and it develops into various styles in different cities. They all have martial scenes involving combat and non-martial scenes narrating ordinary stories, which differs Jiangxi Nuo from other Nuo operas in southwest China.

From late Qing Dynasty to now, there were about 150 Nuo opera performing groups. A [[temple]] for the ''nuo'' god, which was built in the Ming Dynasty, is still in good function today for people to worship the nuo god. About 80 nuo opera programs date from the past still exist today. The number of nuo opera [[masks]] in Jiangxi is over 2000, and there are approximately 2000 professional nuo opera performing folk artists.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Jiangxi}}

==Architecture==
{{Main|Architecture of Jiangxi}}
[[File:牌头屋.jpg|thumb|Building in Jiangxi]]
Jiangxi architecture is heavily influenced by [[Fengshui]] theories of [[Taoism]], one of whose birthplaces is located in [[Mount Longhu]]. It pays much attention to the harmony between inhabitants and the building and can simply make details to fix the direction of the bed in order to be coordinated to [[Four Pillars of Destiny|the background of the inhabitant]]. The Buddhism is also prosperous in Jiangxi, and traditional religional architecture are found [[List of administrative divisions of Jiangxi|in each city]].

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Jiangxi cuisine}}
Jiangxi cuisine favors overtly spicy flavors, an important feature of many southern cuisines. [[Chili peppers]] are directly treated as vegetable instead of as a flavoring and sometimes they are also used in some traditionally unspicy dishes. [[Stir frying]] is one of key techniques in Jiangxi cooking and [[fish]] are common ingredients due to numerous rivers within Jiangxi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3318">'''Saba's culture''' bears the influence of its early settlers, among them the [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[African peoples|Africans]], and [[Dutch people|Dutch]]. Because [[Saba]] measures only five square miles and has a treacherous coastline (making invasion difficult), its population has always been small. Today its population numbers about 1500 people, with approximately 250 being [[expatriate]]s. Many of the non-Sabans teach at or attend the [[Saba University School of Medicine]].   

Although archaeologists have found evidence of early [[Amerindian]] presence, a group of shipwrecked Englishmen in 1632 found the island uninhabited. During the colonial period, Saba's ownership changed hands many times between the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], English, Dutch, and [[French people|French]]. Although part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]] since 1954, Saba's official language (along with that of [[Sint Maarten]] and [[Sint Eustatius]]) is both [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[English language|English]], given the fact that the majority of Sabans speak English as their first language. English has been added to Saba's school curriculum by the Dutch government as a result.

Most Sabans are descended from a handful of families. Hassell, Simmons, and Johnson are common surnames. Early settlers relied on farming, fishing, sailing, and shipbuilding for their livings; [[pirate]]s sought haven there, too. They passed down a hardy nature necessary to survive the island's conditions. 

Because of its difficult terrain (the island is a dormant [[volcano]] rising out of the sea), modern conveniences were slow in coming to Saba. In 1938, construction began to connect its four villages with a road – a feat which engineers had said was impossible due to the island's perilous landscape. Full-time electricity only became available in the 1970s. Its houses have a quaint, cottage look with red roofs. The lifestyle is still slow and old-fashioned with little nightlife, even with the emergence of an [[ecotourism]] industry in the last few decades. Sabans are proud of their history of environmental conservation, calling Saba “The Unspoiled Queen.”  

[[File:Saba Lace 2012.jpg|thumb|Saba Lace, Harry L Johnson Museum, Windwardside, Saba, Jan 2012.]]

Saban women continue to make two traditional island products, [[Saba lace]] and [[Saba Spice]]. Saba Lace is handstitched lace, which the island's women began making in the late 19th century and built into a thriving mail-order business with the United States. Saba Spice is a rum drink, brewed with a combination of spices.  

As in other [[Caribbean]] locations, Sabans throw an annual [[Caribbean Carnival|Carnival]]. Saba's Carnival takes place the last week in July and includes parades, steel bands, competitions, and food.  

[[Catholicism]] is Saba's predominant religion. Other faiths practiced on the island include the [[Anglican]] Church, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Holiness movement|Wesleyan Holiness]], [[Islam]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and [[Judaism]].

[[File:Water molecule (1).svg|thumb|right|The subject of the parody, water, has a molecule consisting of two [[hydrogen]] atoms and one [[oxygen]] atom, thus the name dihydrogen monoxide.]]

The '''dihydrogen monoxide parody''' involves calling [[water]] by the unfamiliar chemical name "'''dihydrogen monoxide'''" ('''DHMO'''), or "'''hydroxylic acid'''" in some cases, and listing some of water's well-known effects in a particularly alarming manner, such as [[rust|accelerating corrosion]] and [[drowning|causing suffocation]]. The parody often calls for dihydrogen monoxide to be banned, regulated, and labeled as dangerous. It illustrates how a lack of [[scientific literacy]] and an exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced fears.

The parody gained renewed popularity in the late 1990s when a 14-year-old student, Nathan Zohner,&lt;ref name="OrlandoSentinel"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-10-28/news/9710280246_1_dihydrogen-monoxide-ban-dihydrogen-dhmo |title=Dihydrogen Monoxide: Unrecognized Killer |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; collected anti-DHMO petitions for a science project about gullibility.&lt;ref name="snopes" /&gt; The story has since been used in science education to encourage [[critical thinking]] and discussion of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Joel J. |editor1-last=Mintzes |editor2-first=William H. |editor2-last=Leonard |title=Handbook of College Science Teaching |publisher=National Science Teachers Association |year=2006 |page=264 |isbn=0873552601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Donald M. |last1=Simanek |first2=John C. |last2=Holden |title=Science Askew: A Light-hearted Look at the Scientific World |publisher=CRC Press |year=2001 |page=71 |isbn=0750307145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A 1983 [[April Fools' Day]] edition of the ''[[Durand Express]]'', a weekly newspaper in [[Durand, Michigan]], reported that "dihydrogen oxide"&lt;!--the source calls it "oxide"--&gt; had been found in the city's water pipes, and warned that it was fatal if inhaled, and could produce blistering vapors.&lt;ref name="Durand"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/af_1983.html |title=April Fool's Day, 1983 |publisher=Museum of Hoaxes |access-date=November 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010418103649/http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/af_1983.html |archive-date=April 18, 2001 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first appearance of the parody on the Internet was attributed by the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' to the so-called "Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide",&lt;ref name="greatmoments" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=April 19, 1997 |title=Internet-inspired prank lands 4 teens in hot water |first=Dennis B. |last=Roddy |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-uZRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0G8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5974%2C1742699 |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a parody organization at UC Santa Cruz following on-campus postings and [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroup]] discussions in 1990.&lt;ref name="recdothumor" /&gt;

Dihydrogen monoxide:
* is also known as hydroxyl acid, and is the major component of acid rain.
* contributes to the "greenhouse effect".
* may cause severe burns.
* contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.
* accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.
* may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.
* has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.
Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:
* as an industrial solvent and coolant.
* in nuclear power plants.
* in the production of styrofoam.
* as a fire retardant.
* in many forms of cruel animal research.
* in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.

A mock [[material safety data sheet]] has also been created for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.improbable.com/2010/03/24/dhmo-material-safety-data-sheet/ |title=DHMO Material Safety Data Sheet |publisher=Improbable Research |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhmo.org/msds/MSDS-DHMO-Kemp.pdf |title=Material Safety Sheet – DiHydrogen Monoxide |publisher=DHMO.org |access-date=November 25, 2018 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Molecular terminology and naming conventions ==
The water [[molecule]] has the [[chemical formula]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, meaning each molecule of water is composed of two [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s and one [[oxygen]] atom. Literally, the term "dihydrogen monoxide" means "two hydrogen, one oxygen", consistent with its molecular formula: the prefix ''[[Wiktionary:di-|di-]]'' in ''dihydrogen'' means "two", the prefix ''[[Wiktionary:mono-|mon-]]'' in ''monoxide'' means "one", and an [[oxide]] is an oxygen atom attached to another atom in an ionic compound.&lt;ref name="nomenclature"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.widener.edu/svb/pset/nomen_b.html |title=Chemical Nomenclature |first=S. E. |last=Van Bramer |year=1996 |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[chemical nomenclature]], various names for water are in common use within the scientific community. Some such names include ''hydrogen oxide'', as well as an [[alkali]] name of ''hydrogen hydroxide'', and several acid names such as ''hydric acid'', ''hydroxic acid'', ''hydroxyl acid'', and ''hydroxilic acid''. The term "hydroxyl acid" used in the original text is a non-[[Naming acids#Nomenclature|standard]] name.&lt;ref name="other name"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluelaketec.com/awater.htm |title=About Water |publisher=Bluelake Technologies |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2016}}

Under the 2005 revisions of [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry]], there is no single correct name for every compound.&lt;ref name="IUPAC2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf |title=Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry: IUP Recommendations 2005 |year=2005 |format=PDF |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary function of chemical nomenclature is to ensure that each name refers, unambiguously, to a single substance. It is considered less important to ensure that each substance should have a single unambiguous name, although the number of acceptable names is limited.&lt;ref name="IUPAC2004" /&gt; ''Water'' is one acceptable name for this compound, even though it is neither a systematic nor an international name and is specific to just one phase of the compound (its liquid form). The other IUPAC recommendation is ''oxidane,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leigh |first1=G. J. |last2=Favre |first2=H.A. |last3=Metanomski |first3=W.V. |year=1998 |url=http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/principles/principles_of_nomenclature.pdf |title=Principles of Chemical Nomenclature: A Guide to IUPAC Recommendations |page=99 |publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd |location=UK |isbn=0-86542-685-6 |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is used by hoax industry groups promoting DHMO as a safe industrial chemical while hinting at dangers and government conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxidane.org/oxidane.html |title=The Oxidane Foundation |website=oxidane.org |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public efforts involving the DHMO parody==
* In 1989&amp;ndash;1990, several students circulated a dihydrogen monoxide contamination warning on the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], campus via photocopied fliers.&lt;ref name="greatmoments"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.matthew.at/dhm.pdf |title=Contamination Warning! |location=UC Santa Cruz |format=PDF |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 1994, Craig Jackson created a web page for the Coalition to Ban DHMO.&lt;ref name="greatmoments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DHMO coalition"/&gt;
* The Friends of Hydrogen Hydroxide website was created by [[Dan Curtis Johnson]]; partly as a foil on the Coalition page, claiming to oppose its "subversive agenda". The site points out that hydrogen hydroxide is "environmentally safe" and "enhances the functionality, growth, and health of many forms of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armory.com/~crisper/DHMO/ |title=Hydrogen Hydroxide: Now More Than Ever! |publisher=Armory.com |access-date=November 25, 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523021635/http://www.armory.com/~crisper/DHMO/ |archive-date=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1997, Nathan Zohner, a 14-year-old student at Eagle Rock Junior High School in [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]], gathered 43 votes to ban the chemical, out of 50 ninth-graders surveyed. Zohner received the first prize at Greater Idaho Falls [[science fair|Science Fair]] for analysis of the results of his survey.&lt;ref name="snopes" /&gt; In recognition of his experiment, journalist [[James K.

'''Drapery''' is a general word referring to [[cloth]]s or [[textile]]s ([[Old French]] ''[[wikt:draperie|draperie]]'', from [[Late Latin]] ''drappus''&lt;ref&gt;"Perhaps of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin" ''[[OED]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;).  It may refer to cloth used for decorative purposes &amp;ndash; such as around windows &amp;ndash; or to the trade of retailing cloth, originally mostly for clothing, formerly conducted by drapers. 

In [[art history]], drapery refers to any cloth or textile depicted, which is usually clothing. The schematic depiction of the folds and woven patterns of loose-hanging clothing on the human form, with ancient prototypes, was reimagined as an adjunct to the female form by Greek vase-painters and sculptors of the earliest fifth century and has remained a major source of stylistic formulas in sculpture and painting, even after the [[Renaissance]] adoption of tighter-fitting clothing styles.  After the Renaissance, large cloths with no very obvious purpose are often used decoratively, especially in portraits in the [[grand manner]]; these are also known as draperies.
[[Image:Fresque Mithraeum Marino.jpg|thumb|280px|Fresco of [[Mithras]] and the Bull from the [[mithraeum]] at Marino, (3rd century CE)]]
For the Greeks, as [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] noted,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Young Johneey: A Study in Ideal Form'' 1956:245ff.&lt;/ref&gt; clinging drapery followed the planes and contours of the bodily form, emphasizing its twist and stretch: "floating drapery makes visible the line of movement through which it has just passed.... Drapery, by suggesting lines of force, indicates for each action a past and a possible future." Clark contrasted the formalized draperies in the frieze at Olympia with the sculptural frieze figures of the [[Parthenon]], where "it has attained a freedom and an expressive power that have never been equalled except by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]". Undraped male figures, Clark observed, "were kept in motion by their flying cloaks."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26912">{{Progressivism}}
The '''Efficiency Movement''' was a major movement in the United States, Britain and other industrial nations in the early 20th century that sought to identify and eliminate waste in all areas of the economy and society, and to develop and implement best practices.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Rodgers, ''Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The concept covered mechanical, economic, social, and personal improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Haber, ''Efficiency and Uplift: Scientific Management in the Progressive Era, 1890–1920'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; The quest for efficiency promised effective, dynamic management rewarded by growth.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer K. Alexander, ''The Mantra of Efficiency: From Waterwheel to Social Control'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the influence of an early proponent, it is more often known as [[Taylorism]].

==United States==
The Efficiency Movement played a central role in the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States, where it flourished 1890–1932.&lt;ref&gt;Haber (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents argued that all aspects of the economy, society and government were riddled with waste and inefficiency.  Everything would be better if experts identified the problems and fixed them.  The result was strong support for building research universities and schools of business and engineering, municipal research agencies, as well as reform of hospitals and medical schools, and the practice of farming.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Spillman, "The Efficiency Movement in Its Relation to Agriculture," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' Vol. 59, (May, 1915), pp. 65–76 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1012894 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best known leaders were engineers [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] (1856–1915), who used a stopwatch to identify the smallest inefficiencies, and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.]] (1868–1924) who proclaimed there was always "one best way" to fix a problem.

Leaders such as [[Herbert Croly]], [[Charles R. van Hise]] and [[Richard T. Ely|Richard Ely]] sought to improve governmental performance by training experts in public service comparable to those in Germany, notably at the Universities of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Schools of business administration set up management programs oriented toward efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Morris, "The Wisconsin Idea and Business Progressivism," ''Journal of American Studies,'' April 1970, Vol. 4#1 pp 39–60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal and state efficiency===
Many cities set up "efficiency bureaus" to identify waste and apply the best practices.  For example, Chicago created an Efficiency Division (1910–16) within the city government's Civil Service Commission, and private citizens organized the Chicago Bureau of Public Efficiency (1910–32).  The former pioneered the study of "personal efficiency," measuring employees' performance through new scientific merit systems and efficiency movement &lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Lee, ''Bureaus of Efficiency: Reforming Local Government in the Progressive Era,'' (Marquette University Press, 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-87462-081-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State governments were active as well. For example, Massachusetts set up its "Commission on Economy and Efficiency" in 1912.  It made hundreds of recommendations.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;Commission on Economy and Efficiency, ''Annual report of the Commission on Economy and Efficiency'' (Boston, 1913), p 76 [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWQNAAAAYAAJ  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Leading philanthropists such as [[Andrew Carnegie]]&lt;ref&gt;Abigail A. Van Slyck, ''Free to All: Carnegie Libraries &amp; American Culture, 1890–1920'' (1998) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John D. Rockefeller]] actively promoted the efficiency movement.  In his many philanthropic pursuits, Rockefeller believed in supporting efficiency.  He once said,
:"To help an inefficient, ill-located, unnecessary school is a waste ...it is highly probable that enough money has been squandered on unwise educational projects to have built up a national system of higher education adequate to our needs, if the money had been properly directed to that end."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17090 John D. Rockefeller, ''Random Reminiscences of Men and Events'' (1933)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
The [[Conservation in the United States|conservation movement]] regarding national resources came to prominence during the Progressive Era.  According to historian [[Samuel P. Hays]], the conservation movement was based on the "gospel of the efficiency.".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Hays, ''Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement 1890–1920'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Massachusetts Commission on Economy and Efficiency reflected the new concern with conservation. It said in 1912:
:"The only proper basis for the protection of game birds, wild fowl and, indeed, all animals is an economic one, and must be based upon carefully constructed and properly enforced laws for the conservation of all species for the benefit of future generations of our citizens, rather than based on local opinion....This expenditure for the protection of fish and game is clearly a wise economy, tending to prevent the annihilation of birds and other animals valuable to mankind which might otherwise become extinct.  It may be said that Massachusetts and her sister States have suffered irreparable loss by carelessly allowing, for generations past, indiscriminate waste of animal life."&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt;

[[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] was the nation's foremost conservationist, putting the issue high on the national agenda by emphasizing the need to eliminate wasteful uses of limited natural resources. He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter,  [[Gifford Pinchot]].  Roosevelt was deeply committed to conserving natural resources, and is considered to be the nation's first [[conservation biology|conservation]] President.&lt;ref&gt;W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservation Legacy'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|325px|left|1908 US editorial cartoon on Theodore Roosevelt and conservation]]

In 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the [[Conference of Governors]] held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: "Conservation as a National Duty."

In contrast, environmentalist [[John Muir]] promulgated a very different view of conservation, rejecting the efficiency motivation. Muir instead preached that nature was sacred and humans are intruders who should look but not develop. Working through the [[Sierra Club]] he founded, Muir tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Nash, ''Wilderness and the American Mind'' (3rd ed. 1982), pp 122–40&lt;/ref&gt;  While Muir wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot's formulation, "to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees." &lt;ref&gt;Gifford Pinchot, ''Breaking New Ground,'' (1947) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National politics===
In U.S. national politics, the most prominent figure was [[Herbert Hoover]], a trained engineer who downplayed politics and believed dispassionate, nonpolitical experts could solve the nation's great problems, such as ending poverty.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Barber, ''From new era to New Deal: Herbert Hoover, the economists, and American economic policy, 1921–1933'' (1989) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on efficiency===
After 1929, [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] blamed the [[Great Depression]] on Hoover and helped to somewhat discredit the movement, though the demand for efficiency and elimination of waste remains an important component of American values.

===Antitrust===
Boston lawyer [[Louis Brandeis]] (1856–1941) argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added a new political dimension to the Efficiency Movement. For instance, while fighting against legalized price fixing, Brandeis launched an effort to influence congressional policymaking with the help of his friend [[Norman Hapgood]], who was then the editor of [[Harper's Weekly]]. He coordinated the publication of a series of articles (''Competition Kills'', ''Efficiency and the One-Price Article'', and ''How Europe deals with the one-price goods''), which were also distributed by the lobbying group American Fair Trade League to legislators, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices, governors, and twenty national magazines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prophets of Regulation|last=McCraw|first=Thomas|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=0674716086|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=103-104}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his works, he was asked to speak before a congressional committee considering the price-fixing bill he drafted. Here, he stated that "big business is not more efficient than little business" and that "it is a mistake to suppose that the department stores can do business cheaper than the little dealer."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brandeis ideas on which business is most efficient conflicted with Croly's positions, which favored efficiency driven by a kind of consolidation gained through large-scale economic operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Herbert Croly of the New Republic: The Life and Thought of an American Progressive|last=Levy|first=David|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1985|isbn=0691047251|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=157-158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1895 Brandeis had warned of the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin I. Urofsky, ''Louis D. Brandeis: a life'' (2009) pp 300–26&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The Curse of Bigness'' he argued, "Efficiency means greater production with less effort and at less cost, through the elimination of unnecessary waste, human and material. How else can we hope to attain our social ideals?."&lt;ref&gt;Louis Brandeis, ''The curse of bigness: miscellaneous papers of Louis D. Brandeis'' edited by Osmond Kessler Fraenkel and Clarence Martin Lewis, (1965) p 51&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued against an appeal to Congress by the state-regulated railroad industry in 1910 seeking an increase in rates. Brandeis explained that instead of passing along increased costs to the consumer, the railroads should pursue efficiency by reducing their overhead and streamlining their operations, initiatives that were unprecedented during the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Efficient Society: Why Canada Is As Close To Utopia As It Gets|last=Heath|first=Joseph|publisher=Penguin Canada|year=2002|isbn=0140292489|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Bedaux system===
The Bedaux system, developed by Franco-American [[management consultant]] [[Charles Bedaux]] (1886–1944) built on the work of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]] and [[Charles Edward Knoeppel|Charles E. Knoeppel]].&lt;ref name=Brech&gt;[[Edward Francis Leopold Brech]], ''Productivity in Perspective, 1914-1974'' (Bristol: Thoemmes Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn&gt;Michael R. Weatherburn, 'Scientific Management at Work: the Bedaux System, Management Consulting, and Worker Efficiency in British Industry, 1914-48' (Imperial College PhD thesis, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Its distinctive advancement beyond these earlier thinkers was the [[Bedaux Unit]] or ''B'', a universal measure for all manual work.&lt;ref name=Littler&gt;Craig R. Littler, ''Development of the Labour Process in Capitalist Societies:  a Comparative Study of the Transformation of Work Organization in Britain, Japan and the USA'' (London: Heinemann, 1982) [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_development_of_the_labour_process_in.html?id=2k2yAAAAIAAJ entry on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

The Bedaux System was influential in the [[United States]] in the 1920s and [[Europe]] in the 1930s and 1940s, especially in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB&gt;Steven Kreis, 'Charles E.

===Relation to other movements===
Later movements had echoes of the Efficiency Movement and were more directly inspired by Taylor and [[Taylorism]].  [[Technocracy movement|Technocracy]], for instance, more of a fad than a movement, and others flourished in the 1930s and 1940s.

Postmodern opponents of nuclear energy in the 1970s broadened their attack to try to discredit movements that saw salvation for human society in technical expertise alone, or which held that scientists or engineers had any special expertise to offer in the political realm.

Coming into usage in 1990, the Western term [[Lean manufacturing]] (lean enterprise, lean production, or simply "Lean") refers to a business idea that considered the expenditure of resources for anything other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Today the Lean concept is broadening to include a greater range of strategic goals, not just cost-cutting and efficiency.

==Britain==
In engineering, the concept of efficiency was developed in Britain in the mid-18th century by [[John Smeaton]] (1724–1792). Called the "father of civil engineering", he studied water wheels and steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (2008) ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 19th century there was much talk about improving the efficiency of the administration and economic performance of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold White, ''Efficiency and empire'' (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ANUBAAAAMAAJ  online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Efficiency''' was an attempt to discredit the old-fashioned habits, customs and institutions that put the British at a handicap in competition with the world, especially with Germany,&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Dawson, ''The German Workman: a Study in National Efficiency'' (1906) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HoxNAAAAMAAJ online]&lt;/ref&gt; which was seen as the epitome of efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. R. Searle]], ''The Quest for National Efficiency, 1899–1914: A Study in Politics and Political Thought'' (Oxford UP, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, "National Efficiency" became a powerful demand&amp;nbsp;— a  movement supported by prominent figures across the political spectrum who disparaged sentimental humanitarianism and identified waste as a mistake that could no longer be tolerated.  The movement took place in two waves; the first wave from 1899 to 1905 was made urgent by the inefficiencies and failures in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902).  ''Spectator'' magazine reported in 1902 there was "a universal outcry for efficiency in all departments of society, in all aspects of life".&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Searle, "The Politics of National Efficiency and of War, 1900–1918" in Chris Wrigley, ed.,  ''A Companion to Early 20th-Century Britain'' (Blackwell, 2003) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most important themes were technocratic efficiency and managerial efficiency.  As White (1899) argued vigorously, the empire needed to be put on a business footing and administered to get better results.  The looming threat of Germany, which was widely seen as a much more efficient nation, added urgency after 1902.  Politically National Efficiency brought together modernizing Conservatives and Unionists, Liberals who wanted to bring modernize their party, and [[Fabian Society|Fabians]] such as [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[H. G. Wells]], along with [[Beatrice Webb|Beatrice]] and [[Sidney Webb]], who had outgrown socialism and saw the utopia of a scientifically up-to-date society supervised by experts such as themselves.  Churchill in 1908 formed an alliance with the Webbs, announcing the goal of a "National Minimum", covering hours, working conditions, and wages&amp;nbsp;– it was a safety net below which the individual would not be allowed to fall.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Kloppenberg, ''Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870–1920'' (1988) p 475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Pelling, ''Winston Churchill'' (1989) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative legislation included the [[Education Act 1902|Education Act of 1902]], which emphasized the role of experts in the schools system.  Higher education was an important initiative, typified by the growth of the [[London School of Economics]], and the foundation of [[Imperial College]].&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a pause in the movement between 1904 and 1909, when interest resumed.  The most prominent new leaders included Liberals [[Winston Churchill]] and [[David Lloyd George]], whose influence brought a bundle of reform legislation that introduced the welfare state to Britain.

Much of the popular and elite support for National Efficiency grew out of concern for Britain's military position, especially with respect to Germany.  The Royal Navy underwent a dramatic modernization, most famously in the introduction of the ''[[Dreadnought]]'', which in 1906 revolutionized naval warfare overnight.

==Germany==
In Germany the efficiency movement was called "rationalization" and it was a powerful social and economic force before 1933. In part it looked explicitly at American models, especially [[Fordism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Nolan, "Housework Made Easy: the Taylorized Housewife in Weimar Germany's Rationalized Economy," ''Feminist Studies.'' Volume: 16. Issue: 3. pp 549+&lt;/ref&gt; The Bedaux system was widely adopted in the rubber and tire industry, despite strong resistance in the socialist labor movement to the Bedaux system. [[Continental AG]], the leading rubber company in Germany, adopted the system and profited heavily from it, thus surviving the Great Depression relatively undamaged and improving its competitive capabilities. However most German businessmen preferred the home-grown '''REFA system''' which focused on the standardization of working conditions, tools, and machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Erker, "Das Bedaux-System: Neue Aspekte der Historischen Rationalisierungsforschung,["The Bedaux system: new aspects of research on the history of rationalization"], ''Zeitschrift für Unternehmensgeschichte,'' 1996, Vol. 41#2 pp 139–158&lt;/ref&gt;

"Rationalization" meant higher productivity and greater efficiency, promising science would bring prosperity. More generally it promised a new level of modernity and was applied to economic production and consumption as well as public administration. Various versions of rationalization were promoted by industrialists and Social Democrats, by engineers and architects, by educators and academics, by middle class feminists and social workers, by government officials and politicians of many parties. It was ridiculed by the extremists in the Communist movement. As ideology and practice, rationalization challenged and transformed not only machines, factories, and vast business enterprises but also the lives of middle-class and working-class Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Union==
Ideas of Science Management was very popular in the Soviet Union. One of the leading theorists and practitioners of the Scientific Management in Soviet Russia was [[Alexei Gastev]]. The [[Central Institute of Labour]] (Tsentralnyi Institut Truda, or TsIT), founded by Gastev in 1921 with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s support, was a veritable citadel of socialist Taylorism.
Fascinated by Taylorism and Fordism, Gastev has led a popular movement for the “scientific organization of labor” (Nauchnaya Organizatsiya Truda, or NOT).
Because of its emphasis on the cognitive components of labor, some scholars consider Gastev’s NOT to represent a [[Karl Marx|Marxian]] variant of cybernetics. As with the concept of 'Organoprojection' (1919) by [[Pavel Florensky]], underlying [[Nikolai Bernstein]] and Gastev's approach, lay a powerful man-machine metaphor.

==Japan==
[[W. Edwards Deming]] (1900–1993) brought the efficiency movement to Japan after World War II, teaching top management how to improve design (and thus service), product quality, testing and sales (the last through global markets), especially using statistical methods.  Deming then brought his methods back to the U.S. in the form of quality control called [[continuous improvement process]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Gabor, ''The Man Who Discovered Quality: How W. Edwards Deming Brought the Quality Revolution to America'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gallo-Roman religion]], &lt;!-- do not put [[Celtic mythology]] without citing a specific instance of Celtic mythology where Epona appears, please --&gt; '''Epona''' was a protector of [[horse]]s, [[ponies]], [[donkey]]s, and [[mule]]s. She was particularly a goddess of [[fertility]], as shown by her attributes of a [[patera]], [[cornucopia]], ears of grain and the presence of [[foal]]s in some sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon Reinach, "Épona", ''Revue archéologique'' (1895:163–95)&lt;/ref&gt; She and her horses might also have been [[Psychopomp|leaders of the soul]] in the after-life ride, with parallels in [[Rhiannon]] of the [[Mabinogion]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Hubert, ''Mélanges linguistiques offerts à M. J.Vendryes'' (1925:187–198).&lt;/ref&gt; The worship of Epona, "the sole Celtic divinity ultimately worshipped in Rome itself",&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Fray Bober, reviewing Réne Magnen, ''Epona, Déesse Gauloise des Chevaux, Protectrice des Cavaliers'' in ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''62'''.3 (July 1958, pp. 349–350) p. 349.  Émile Thevenot contributed a ''corpus'' of 268 dedicatory inscriptions and representations.&lt;/ref&gt; was widespread in the [[Roman Empire]] between the first and third centuries AD; this is unusual for a Celtic deity, most of whom were associated with specific localities.

==Etymology==
Although known only from Roman contexts, the name Epona ('Great Mare') is from the [[Gaulish language]]; it is derived from the inferred [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] *''ekwos'' 'horse',&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Latin language|Latin]] ''equus'', Greek ''hippos''.&lt;/ref&gt; which gives rise to modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''ebol'' 'foal', together with the [[augmentative]] [[suffix]] ''-on'' frequently, though not exclusively, found in [[theonym]]s (for example [[Sirona]], [[Matres and Matrones|Matrona]]) and the usual Gaulish feminine singular ''-a''.&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, 2003:163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; In an episode preserved in a remark of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/DemeterFamily.html#Poseidon Pausanias, viii.25.5, 37.1 and 42.1] The myth was noted in ''Bibliotheke'' 3.77 and reflected also in a lost poem of [[Callimachus]] and in Ptolemy Hephaestion's ''New History''.&lt;/ref&gt; an archaic  [[Demeter#Demeter and Poseidon|Demeter Erinys (Vengeful Demeter)]] too had also been a Great Mare, who was mounted by [[Poseidon]] in the form of a stallion and foaled [[Arion (mythology)|Arion]] and [[Despoina|the Daughter]] who was unnamed outside the Arcadian mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Gods of the Greeks'' (1951) pp 184ff "Demeter and Poseidon's stallion-marriages".&lt;/ref&gt; Demeter was venerated as a mare in [[Lycosura|Lycosoura]] in [[Arcadia]] into historical times.

==Evidence==

[[Image:Epona.jpg|thumb|Epona and her horses, from Köngen, Germany, about 200 AD.]]
Fernand Benoît found the earliest attestations of a cult of Epona in the [[Danubian provinces]] and asserted that she had been introduced in the ''[[limes]]'' of Gaul by horsemen from the east.&lt;ref&gt;Benoît, F. (1950). ''Les mythes de l'outre-tombe. Le cavalier à l'anguipède et l'écuyère Épona''. Brussels, Latomus Revue d'études latines.&lt;/ref&gt; That suggestion has not been generally taken up.
 
Although the name is Gaulish, dedicatory inscriptions to Epona are in [[Latin language|Latin]] or, rarely, [[Greek language|Greek]]. They were made not only by [[Celt]]s, but also by [[Ancient Germany|German]]s, Romans, and other inhabitants of the [[Roman Empire]]. An inscription to Epona from Mainz, Germany, identifies the dedicator as Syrian.&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' 13, 11801&lt;/ref&gt;

A long Latin inscription of the first century BC, engraved in a lead sheet and accompanying the sacrifice of a filly and the [[votive gift]] of a cauldron, was found in 1887 at [[Rom, Deux-Sèvres]], the Roman Rauranum. Olmsted reads the inscription as invoking the goddess with an archaic profusion of epithets: ''Eponina'' 'dear little Epona', ''Atanta'' 'horse-goddess', ''Potia'' 'powerful Mistress' (compare Greek ''[[Potnia]]''), ''Dibonia'' (Latin, the 'good goddess')", ''Catona'' 'of battle', noble and good ''Vovesia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G.S. Olmsted |title=Gaulish and Celtiberian poetic inscriptions |journal=Mankind Quarterly |volume=28 |number=4 |pages=339–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Olmsted's interpretation has not been generally accepted by other scholars; Meid interprets the same inscription as an invocation of [[Divona|Dibona]] in vulgar Greek for aid in a romantic dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wolfgang Meid |editor1-first=Pierre-Yves |editor1-last=Lambert |editor2-first=Georges-Jean |editor2-last=Pinault |pages=277–290 |title=Gaulois et celtique continental |chapter=Pseudogallische inschriften |year=2007 |publisher=Librairie Droz |isbn=9782600013376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epona's feast day in the Roman calendar was given as December 18 on a rustic calendar from [[Guidizzolo]], Italy,&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; although this may have been only a local celebration. She was incorporated into the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]] by being invoked on behalf of the Emperor, as ''Epona Augusta'' or ''Epona Regina''.

The supposed autonomy of Celtic civilization in Gaul{{clarify|date=June 2015}} suffered a further setback with Fernand Benoît's study&lt;ref&gt;Benoît 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; of the funereal symbolism of the horseman with the serpent-tailed (''"anguiforme"'') daemon, which he established as a theme of victory over death, and Epona; both he found to be late manifestations of Mediterranean-influenced symbolism, which had reached Gaul through contacts with [[Etruria]] and [[Magna Graecia]]. Benoît compared the rider with most of the riders imaged around the Mediterranean shores.

Perceptions of native Celtic goddesses had changed under Roman [[hegemony]]: only the names remained the same. As Gaul was Romanized under the early Empire, Epona’s sovereign role evolved into a protector of cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Oaks 1986:79–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The cult of Epona was spread over much of the Roman Empire by the auxiliary cavalry, ''[[Ala (Roman military)|alae]]'', especially the Imperial Horse Guard or ''equites singulares augustii'' recruited from [[Gaul]], [[Germania Inferior|Lower Germany]], and [[Pannonia]]. A series of their dedications to Epona and other Celtic, Roman and German deities was found in Rome, at the Lateran.&lt;ref&gt;Spiedel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; As '''Epane''' she is attested in [[Cantabria]], northern Spain, on Mount Bernorio, Palencia,&lt;ref&gt;Simón.&lt;/ref&gt; as '''Iccona Loiminna'''{{dubious|date=October 2012}} in  Portugal on the [[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]] inscription of [[Lusitanian language#Writing system|Cabeço das Fráguas]].

A [[euhemerist]]ic account of Epona's origin occurs in the ''Parallela Minora'', which were traditionally attributed to [[Plutarch]] (but are now classed as "Pseudo-Plutarch"):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fulvius Stellus hated women and used to consort with a mare and in due time the mare gave birth to a beautiful girl and they named her Epona. She is the goddess that is concerned with the protection of horses. So [[Agesilaus (historian)|Agesilaüs]] in the third book of his ''Italian History.''&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Parallela Minora'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Parallela_Minora*.html#29 29], also found cited as 312e (= Agesilaus ''[[FGrHist]]'' F 1).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The tale was passed along in the context of unseemly man-beast coupling&lt;!--presumably this is what the originally confusing statement here had meant--&gt; in [[Giambattista Della Porta]]'s edition of ''Magia naturalis'' (1589), a potpourri of the sensible and questionable, erroneously citing Plutarch's ''Life of Solon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Giambattista Della Porta|title=Magia naturalis, sive De miraculis rerum naturalium|location=Lyon|year=1569|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9j1m8oXBlEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}{{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;!--I'm not finding the reference to Epona in either the Antwerp 1562 edition or this one, which may be the correct date rather than 1589, though I'm nothing but grateful for the discovery of this charming work--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It may represent some recollection of  [[Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] [[horse sacrifice]], such as the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] ''[[ashvamedha]]'' and the [[Horse sacrifice#Irish|Irish ritual described by Giraldus Cambrensis]], both of which have to do with kingship. In the Celtic ritual, the king mates with a white mare thought to embody the goddess of sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Litchfield West|M.L. West]], ''Indo-European Poetry and Myth'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Robbins Dexter, "Horse Goddess," in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[Image:Epona Salonica601 ArchMus.jpg|thumb|A relief of Epona, flanked by two pairs of horses, from Roman Macedonia.]]

Sculptures of Epona fall into five types, as distinguished by Benoît: riding, standing or seated before a horse, standing or seated between two horses, a tamer of horses in the manner of ''[[potnia theron]]'' and the symbolic mare and foal. In the Equestrian type, common in [[Gaul]], she is depicted sitting side-saddle on a horse or (rarely) lying on one; in the Imperial type (more common outside Gaul) she sits on a throne flanked by two or more horses or foals.&lt;ref&gt;Nantonos, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In distant [[Dacia]], she is represented on a [[stela]] (now at the Szépmüvézeti Museum, Budapest) in the format of [[Cybele]], seated frontally on a throne with her hands on the necks of her paired animals: her horses are substitutions for Cybele's lions.

==In literature and art==
Epona is mentioned in ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]], where an [[aedicula]]r niche with her image on a pillar in a stable has been garlanded with freshly picked roses.&lt;ref&gt;''"respicio pilae mediae, quae stabuli trabes sustinebat, in ipso fere meditullio Eponae deae simulacrum residens aediculae, quod accurate corollis roseis equidem recentibus fuerat ornatum."'' (iii.27). In [[Robert Graves]]' translation of ''The Golden Ass'', he has interposed an explanatory "the Mare-headed Mother" that does not appear in the Latin text; it would have linked Epona with the primitive mythology of [[Demeter#Demeter and Poseidon|Demeter]], who was covered as a mare by [[Poseidon]] in stallion-form (see above); there is no justification for identifying Epona with Demeter, however.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Satires of Juvenal|Satires]]'', the Roman poet [[Juvenal]] also links the worship and iconography of Epona to the area of a stable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Satires of Juvenal|Satire VIII]]'' lines 155–57, where the narrator derides a consul for his inappropriate interest in horses:

&lt;/ref&gt; Small images of Epona have been found in Roman sites of stables and barns over a wide territory. Epona is also indirectly mentioned in Victor Hugo's ''Les Misérables'', as one of his characters is named for her- Éponine. In popular video game series ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', the main character's horse is named "Epona" after the goddess. The game horse is always brown or chestnut, with a white mane.

==In Great Britain==
The probable date of c. 1380-550 BC ascribed to the [[Uffington White Horse|giant chalk horse]] carved into the hillside turf at [[Uffington, Oxfordshire|Uffington]], in southern England, may be too early to be directly associated with Epona, and may not actually represent a horse at all. The [[West Country]] traditional [[hobby horse|hobby-horse]] riders parading on [[May Day]] at [[Padstow]], Cornwall and [[Minehead]], Somerset, which survived to the mid-twentieth century, even though [[Morris dance]]s had been forgotten, was thought by folklorists through the 20th Century to have deep roots in the veneration of Epona, as may the British aversion to eating horsemeat.&lt;ref&gt;Theo Brown, "Tertullian and Horse-Cults in Britain" ''Folklore'' '''61'''.1 (March 1950, pp. 31–34) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; At Padstow formerly, at the end of the festivities the hobby-horse was ritually submerged in the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Kille, "West Country hobby-horses and cognate customs" ''Proceedings of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society'' '''77''' (1931)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no firm evidence of the festival before the 18th Century

A provincial, though not crude, small (7.5&amp;nbsp;cm high) Roman bronze of a seated Epona, flanked by a small mare and stallion, found in England,&lt;ref&gt;Wiltshire is believable, but was added to the provenance, merely "''trouvée en Angleterre''", after the piece had been described in the sale catalogue of the Ferencz Pulszky collection, Paris, 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; is conserved in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;"provincial, but not barbaric" is the assessment of the style by Catherine Johns, "A Roman Bronze Statuette of Epona", ''The British Museum Quarterly'' '''36'''.1/2 (Autumn 1971:37–41).&lt;/ref&gt; Lying on her lap and on the [[patera]] raised in her right hand are disproportionately large ears of grain; ears of grain also protrude from the mouths of the ponies, whose heads are turned towards the goddess. On her left arm she holds a yoke, which curves up above her shoulder, an attribute unique to this bronze statuette.&lt;ref&gt;Identified as a yoke by Catherine Johns 1971; its misidentification as a [[Serpent (mythology)|serpent]] has led to misleading identification of a "[[chthonic]]" Epona.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] figure [[Rhiannon]] rides a white horse but has no other attributes in common with Epona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=Pagan Britain|year=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300197716|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; A south Welsh folk ritual call [[Mari Lwyd]] (Grey Mare) is still undertaken in December, which some folklorists likewise have held up as an apparent survival of the veneration of the goddess, but again there is no firm evidence to support the age of the practice. The [[pantomime horse]] is thought to be a related survival.

==Today==
On [[Mackinac Island]], Michigan, Epona is celebrated each June with stable tours, a blessing of the animals and the Epona and Barkus Parade. Mackinac Island does not permit personal automobiles; the primary source of transportation remains the horse, so celebrating Epona has special significance on this island in the upper midwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mackinacislandlilacfestival.org |title=Mackinac Island Lilac  Festival |work=mackinacislandlilacfestival.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202155236/http://www.mackinacislandlilacfestival.org/ |archivedate=February 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Feast of Epona" involves the blessing of horses and other animals by a local churchman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mackinacislandnews.com/news/2008-06-21/front_page/019.html |title=Animals Are Blessed During Feast of Epona |author=Caitlyn Kienitz |date=2008-06-21 |accessdate=2015-06-29 |website=Town Crier (www.mackinacislandnews.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To this may also be added '''Karpasika''' which on account of its rare appearance seems to be clinging to some original form phonetically very near to the Sanskritised form Karpasika when more common form as Kapisa and Kamboja were being commonly used"'' (See: Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahābhārata: Upāyana Parva, 1945, P 44, Dr Moti Chandra.&lt;/ref&gt; The Paninian term ''Kapiśi'' is believed to have been the capital of ancient Kamboja.&lt;ref&gt;A Comparative Study of Thirty City-state Cultures: An Investigation, 2000, p 388, Dr Hansen, Mogens Herman (ed(d).&lt;/ref&gt; Kapiśa (''Ki-pin, Ke-pin, Ka-pin, Chi-pin of the Chinese records'') refers to the Kamboja kingdom, located on the south-eastern side of the [[Hindukush]] in the [[Paropamisadae]] region. It was anciently inhabited by the [[Ashvakayana|Aśvakayana]] (Greek: [[Assakenoi]]), and the [[Ashvayana|Aśvayana]] (Greek [[Aspasio]]) (q.v.) sub-tribes of the [[Kambojas]]. Epic [[Mahabharata]] refers to two Kamboja settlements: one called Kamboja, adjacent to the [[Darada]]s (of Gilgit), extending from  [[Kafiristan]] to south-east [[Kashmir]] including Rajauri/Poonch districts,&lt;ref&gt;[[The History and Culture of the Indian People]], 1977, p 15, Dr Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, Dr Achut Dattatraya Pusalker, Dr Asoke Kumar Majumdar; [[An Advanced History of India]], 1973, p 54, Dr Rameṣa-Chandra Majumdar; The Soul of India, 1961,p 56, [[Amaury de Riencourt|Amaury De Riencourt]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 7.4.5; Mahabharata II.27.23.&lt;/ref&gt; while the original Kamboja, known as [[Parama Kamboja]], was located north of [[Hindukush]] in [[Transoxiana]] territory, mainly in [[Badakshan]] and [[Pamirs]]/[[Allai Valley|Allai valley]], as neighbors to the [[Rishikas]] in the [[Scythia]]n land.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata II.27.25; Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India: Their Religion and ..., 1874, p 365, Dr John Muir - 1874; Die Voelker des oestlichen Asien: Studien und Reisen, 1865, p 186, Adolf Bastian; The Problems of Ancient India, 2000, p 1-8, K.

See: India as Known to Pāṇini: A Study of the Cultural Material in the Ashṭādhyāyī, 1953, p 64, Dr Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]] refers to two Kamboja territories/and or ethnics - viz.: ''Tambyzoi'', located north of Hindukush on [[Oxus]] in [[Bactria]]/[[Badakshan]], and ''Ambautai'', located on the southern side of Hindukush in [[Paropamisadae]]. The Komoi clan of Ptolemy, inhabiting towards Sogdiana mountainous regions north of Bactria, is believed by scholars to represent the Kamboja people.&lt;ref&gt;Central Asiatic provinces of the Maurya Empire, p 403, Dr H.C. Seth; See also: Indian Historical Quarterly, Vol XIII, 1937, p 400-403; cf: History and Archaeology of India's Contacts with other Countries, from Earliest Times to 300 B.C., 1976, p 152, Shashi Asthana. For Kamboja Nomads in Central Asia, Cf also: India and Central Asia, p 25, Dr P. C. Bagchi.&lt;/ref&gt; Front ranking scholars like Dr. S. Levi, Dr [[Michael Witzel]], and numerous others accept the identity of Tambyzoi and Ambautai with Sanskrit Kamboja. The [[Ptolemy|Ptolemian]] ''Ambautai'' formed parts of the Kapiśa kingdom under sway of Aśvakayana/Aśvayana (Aśvaka) Kambojas. It appears probable that the original home of the Kambojas was trans-Oxian Kamboja, from where some tribal sections moved southwards and established colonies in [[Paropamisadae|Paropamisan]] on southern side of Hindukush. Over time, the ''Paropamisan'' settlements came to be addressed as Kamboja proper, whereas the original Kamboja settlement lying north of [[Hindukush]] in [[Transoxiana]] became known as 'Parama-Kamboja', or ''furthest Kamboja''.&lt;ref&gt;See: Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India: Their Religion and ..., 1874, p 365, Prof John Muir; Geographical Data in the Early Purāṇas: A Critical Study, 1972, p 167-68, Dr M. R. Singh.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars call Parama Kamboja 'Uttara-Kamboja', or ''northern Kamboja''&lt;ref&gt;See: Development of Hindu Polity and Political Theories, 1927, p 227, Narayanchandra Banerjee.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Distant Kamboja''.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1930, p 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kapisa-Kamboja equivalence, as suggested by scholars such as Dr. Levi, applies to the [[Paropamisadae|Paropamisan]] Kamboja settlement.

==Kafir and Kafiristan etymologically derived from Kapiśa==
According to the conventional [[etymology]], the name "Kafir" derives from Arabic ''[[Kafir]]'', commonly translated into [[English language|English]] as  "infidels" or "idolaters." ''Kafiristan'', then, would be "The Land of the Infidels". This explanation would justify the renaming of the country after its [[Islam]]ization.

Many historians,&lt;ref&gt;For instance,Dr Thomas Watters, Dr Moti Chandra, Dr Suniti Kumar Chaterjee, Prof Surya Kanta, Dr J. L. Kamboj etc.&lt;/ref&gt; however, opine that the local name "Kafir" comes from ''Kapiś'' (= ''Kapish''), the ancient [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] name of the region that included historic Kafiristan. This is also given as "Ki-pin" (or ''Ke-pin, Ka-pin, Chi-pin'') in old [[Chinese language|Chinese]] chronicles. This name, unrelated to the Arabic word, is believed to have, at some point, changed into the word ''Kapir''. This [[natural language|linguistic]] phenomenon is not unusual for this region. The name of King [[Kanishka|Kanishaka]], who once ruled over this region, is also found written as "Kanerika", an example of  "ś" or "sh" changing to "r."&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland, 1856, p 239, by Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland; Indian Caste, 1877, p 286, John Wilson; India of To-day, 1906, p 280, Walter Del Mar.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, ''Kapiś'' – the name of the people of Kapiś/Kapiśa – is believed to have changed to Kapir and then Kafir.&lt;ref&gt;Ref: Publications, 1904, p 124, Published by Oriental Translation Fund (Editors T. W. Rhys Davis, Dr S. W. Bushel, London Royal Asiatic Society); Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahābhārata: Upāyana Parva, 1945, p 44, Dr Moti Chandra - India; Census of India, 1961, p 26, published by India Office of the Registrar General; Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahabharata, Upana parava, Journal of Uttara Pradesh Historical Society, Vol XVI, Part II, pp 48-50; Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, Dr J. L. Kamboj, Dr Satyarti Shastri; The Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, p 94, Kirpal Singh; See also: Kāṭhakasaṅkalanam: Saṃskr̥tagranthebhyaḥ saṅgr̥hītāni Kāṭhakabrāhmaṇa, Kāṭhakaśrautasūtra, 1981, p xii, Surya Kanta; cf: The Contemporary Review, Vol LXXII, July-Dec, 1897, p 869, A. Strahan (etc), London; See also: On Yuan Chwang's Travels in India, 629-645 A.D., 1904, 124, Dr Thomas Watters. '''See Link:''' [https://books.google.com/books?id=N9YMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=Kanerka,+kafir].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Levi states that ''Chinese Kipin is a rendering of an Indian word Kapir'' (See quote in: Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahābhārata: Upāyana Parva, 1945, p 44, Dr Moti Chandra - India; See also: Bhārata-kaumudī; Studies in Indology in Honour of Dr. Radha Kumud Mookerji, 1945, p 916, Dr Radhakumud Mookerji - India).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ancient Sanskrit literature, there are numerous instances where the name of the people was obtained from the geographical territory they belonged to or occupied. Thus, Kamboja was both the name of the people as well as their country. Similarly, Gandhara, Vahika, Kuru etc. were names of people as well as their countries. In a similar way, the inhabitants of Kapis (Kapisa) were known as Kapis ==&gt; Kapir which later transmuted to Kafir.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the dominant clan of the Kafirs was known as ''Katir'' until recently.

The second change from ''Kapir'' to ''Kafir'' may have occurred spontaneously, since the exchange of "p" by "f" is common in [[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref&gt;cf: An Abridged Malay-English Dictionary (romanized), 1908, p 95
by Richard James Wilkinson; Bahasa Indonesia: Introduction to Indonesian Language and Culture, 1990, p 13, Yohanni Johns, Robyn Stokes - Foreign Language Study.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also have been the result of confusion or intentional wordplay with the [[Arabic]] word, since the Kafirs were [[Paganism|pagan]]s until 1895.

The derivation of Kafiristan is now fairly easy, since ''-stan'' in Iranian language means country, abode, or place. Kafiristan would literally mean the ''land or abode of the Kafir (Kapir) peoples'' i.e. people belonging to Kapiśa.

Today, it is disputed if the term ''Kafir'' really defines a traditional [[ethnic group]].

'''''Exercises in Style''''' ({{lang-fr|Exercices de style}}), written by [[Raymond Queneau]], is a collection of 99 retellings of the same story, each in a different style. In each, the narrator gets on the "S" bus (now no. 84), witnesses an altercation between a man (a [[zazou]]) with a long neck and funny hat and another passenger, and then sees the same person two hours later at the [[Gare St-Lazare]] getting advice on adding a button to his overcoat. The literary variations recall the famous 33rd chapter of the 1512 rhetorical guide by [[Desiderius Erasmus]], ''[[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style]]''.

[[Pero Kvrgić]] and Lela Margitić, who have been playing the only two roles since January 1970, hold a Guinness World Record for the Longest Theatrical Run with the Same Cast. They received a plaque in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-4000/longest-theatrical-run-same-cast/ | title=Longest theatrical run - same cast | work=guinnessworldrecords.com | publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] | accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Following the formal example of Queneau, Paul Hoover of the [[United States]] published Sonnet 56 (2009), which consists of 56 stylistic versions of Shakespeare's sonnet 56, including "Villanelle," "Qasida," "Course Description," and "Ballad."
* Following the example of Queneau, Bethany M. Brownholtz published [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bethany_Brownholtz/publication/283425541_Exercises_in_Style_21st_Century_Remix/links/5638004c08ae78d01d3951b5.pdf?inViewer=0&amp;pdfJsDownload=0&amp;origin=publication_detail Exercises in Style: 21st Century Remix] (2013), which consists of 40 additional versions, focusing on styles that have emerged over the last 60 years.
* The same story was told in more than hundred new styles in Russian by Tatiana Bonch-Osmolovskaya, Sergey Fedin, Sergey Orlov and others [http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4468458/] The styles includes combinatorial techniques, contemporary jargons and visuals poems.

A '''film series''', '''film franchise''', '''movie series''', or '''movie franchise''' is a collection of related films in succession that share the same [[fictional universe]], or are marketed as a series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/series-part1-AtoE.html|title=Greatest Movie Series - Film Franchises of All-Time|publisher=filmsite.org|quote=A film series is a collection of related movies released in succession over a period of time, for instance, the Tarzan movies. Usually, films in a series include common elements, such as characters (i.e., the Frankenstein films), actors/actresses (Astaire &amp; Rogers), or names in a title (the Pink Panther films), etc. Sometimes, a film series is based upon the same director (i.e., Robert Rodriguez' Mariachi Trilogy, or Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain Trilogy), or it can be based upon the studio (i.e., Hammer's Dracula films).|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Sometimes the work is conceived from the beginning as a multiple-film work – for example, the ''[[Three Colours]]'' series – but in most cases the success of the original film inspires further films to be made. Individual [[sequel]]s are relatively common, but are not always successful enough to spawn further installments.

However, ''[[Star Wars]]'' has the highest when adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Movie Franchises - Box Office History|work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|publisher = Nash Information Services, LLC|url = http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/franchisesW.php|accessdate = 2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Furniture''' refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating (e.g., [[chair]]s, [[Stool (seat)|stools]], and [[sofa]]s), eating ([[table (furniture)|tables]]), and sleeping (e.g., [[bed]]s). Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and [[desk]]s), or to store things (e.g., [[cupboard]]s and [[Shelf (storage)|shelves]]). Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of [[decorative art]]. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of [[woodworking joints]] which often reflect the local culture.

People have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation. Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a [[Venus figurine]] found in [[Russia]], depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of [[Skara Brae]] in [[Scotland]], and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. Complex construction techniques such as [[joinery (woodworking)|joinery]] began in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic]] period of [[ancient Egypt]]. This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including [[stool (seat)|stools]] and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], with thrones being commonplace as well as the [[klinai]], multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. The furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined by [[revival styles]]. The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards [[Modernism]]. One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.&lt;ref name=povo /&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:furniture|furniture]]'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[wikt:fourniture|fourniture]]'',{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2016}} the noun form of ''[[wikt:fournir|fournir]]'', which means to supply or provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fournir|title=English Translation of "fournir" – Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''fourniture'' in French means supplies or provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fourniture|title=English Translation of "fourniture" – Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English usage, referring specifically to household objects, is specific to that language;{{sfn|Weekley|2013|pp=609–610}} French and other Romance languages as well as German use variants of the word ''[[wikt:meubles|meubles]]'', which derives from Latin ''[[wikt:mobilia|mobilia]]'', meaning "moveable goods".{{sfn|Solodow|2010|p=146}}

==History==
===Prehistoric furniture===
[[File:Ankara Muzeum B19-36.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük]] statue is evidence that furniture existed in the [[neolithic]].]]
The practice of using natural objects as rudimentary pieces of furniture likely dates to the beginning of human civilisation.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} Early humans are likely to have used tree stumps as seats, rocks as rudimentary tables, and mossy areas for sleeping.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} During the late [[palaeolithic]] or early [[neolithic]] period, from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone and animal bones.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=1}} The earliest evidence for the existence of constructed furniture is a [[Venus figurine]] found at the [[Gagarino]] site in [[Russia]], which depicts the goddess in a sitting position, on a throne.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}} A similar [[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük|statue of a Mother Goddess]] was found in [[Catal Huyuk]] in [[Turkey]], dating to between 6000 and 5500 BCE.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} The inclusion of such a seat in the figurines implies that these were already common artefacts of that age.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}}

[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|[[Skara Brae]] house home furnishings, a dresser with shelves]]
A range of unique stone furniture has been excavated in [[Skara Brae]], a [[Neolithic]] village in [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]]. The site dates from 3100–2500 BCE and due to a shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with stone, a readily available material that could be worked easily and turned into items for use within the household. Each [[house]] shows a high degree of sophistication and was equipped with an extensive assortment of stone furniture, ranging from cupboards, dressers and beds to shelves, stone seats, and [[limpet]] tanks. The stone dresser was regarded as the most important as it symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is therefore the first item seen when entering, perhaps displaying symbolic objects, including decorative artwork such as several Neolithic [[Carved Stone Balls]] also found at the site.

[[Ancient Furniture|Ancient furniture]] has been excavated from the 8th-century BCE [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[tumulus]], the Midas Mound, in [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|Gordion]], [[Turkey]]. Pieces found here include [[table (furniture)|tables]] and inlaid serving stands. There are also surviving works from the 9th-8th-century BCE [[Assyria]]n palace of [[Nimrud]]. The earliest surviving carpet, the [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]] Carpet was discovered in a frozen tomb in [[Siberia]] and has been dated between the 6th and 3rd century BCE.

===Ancient Egypt===
Civilisation in [[ancient Egypt]] began with the clearance and irrigation of land along the banks of the [[River Nile]],&lt;ref&gt;Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'' (Charles Schribner's Sons Publishing: New York, 1966) p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; which began in about 6000 BCE. By that time, society in the [[Nile Valley]] was already engaged in organized agriculture and the construction of large buildings.&lt;ref name="Redford 6"&gt;Redford, Donald B. ''Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times.'' (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  At this period, Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and also constructing large buildings. [[Mortar (masonry)|Mortar]] was in use by around 4000 BCE The inhabitants of the Nile Valley and delta were self-sufficient and were raising barley and [[emmer]] (an early variety of wheat) and stored it in pits lined with reed mats.&lt;ref name="Carl Roebuck p. 52"&gt;Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  They raised cattle, goats and pigs and they wove linens and baskets.&lt;ref name="Carl Roebuck p. 52"/&gt; Evidence of furniture from the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]] is scarce, but samples from [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] tombs indicate an already advanced use of furnishings in the houses of the age.{{sfn|Metropolitan Museum of Art|1999|p=117}}

During the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|dynastic period]], which began in around 3200 BCE, Egyptian art developed significantly, and this included furniture design.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=1}} Egyptian furniture was primarily constructed using wood, but other materials were sometimes used, such as [[leather]],{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=14}} and pieces were often adorned with gold, silver, ivory and ebony, for decoration.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=14}} Wood found in Egypt was not suitable for furniture construction, so had to be imported into the country from other places,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=1}} particularly [[Phoenicia]].{{sfn|Gadalla|2007|p=243}} The scarcity of wood necessitated innovation in construction techniques. The use of [[scarf joint]]s to join two shorter pieces together and form a longer beam was one example of this,{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|pp=13–14}} as well as construction of [[Wood veneer|veneers]] in which low quality cheap wood was used as the main building material, with a thin layer of expensive wood on the surface.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=14}}

The earliest used seating furniture in the dynastic period was the [[stool (seat)|stool]], which was used throughout Egyptian society, from the royal family down to ordinary citizens.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Various different designs were used, including stools with four vertical legs, and others with crossed splayed legs; almost all had rectangular seats, however.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Examples include the workman's stool, a simple three legged structure with a concave seat, designed for comfort during labour,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|p=6}} and the much more ornate folding stool, with crossed folding legs,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6–7}} which were decorated with carved duck heads and ivory,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6–7}} and had hinges made of [[bronze]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Full [[chair]]s were much rarer in early Egypt, being limited to only wealthy and high ranking people, and seen as a status symbol; they did not reach ordinary households until the [[eighteenth dynasty]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Early examples were formed by adding a straight back to a stool, while later chairs had an inclined back.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Other furniture types in ancient Egypt include tables, which are heavily represented in art, but almost nonexistent as preserved items – perhaps because they were placed outside tombs rather than within,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=21}} as well as beds and storage chests.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=22}}{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=24}}

===Ancient Greece===
Historical knowledge of Greek furniture is derived from various sources, including [[Greek literature|literature]], [[terracotta]], sculptures, statuettes, and painted vases.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Some pieces survive to this day, primarily those constructed from metals, including bronze, or marble.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was an important material in Greek furniture, both domestic and imported.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} A common technique was to construct the main sections of the furniture with cheap solid wood, then apply a veneer using an expensive wood, such as maple or ebony.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Greek furniture construction also made use of [[dowels]] and [[Mortise and tenon|tenons]] for joining the wooden parts of a piece together.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe, and furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold or other precious materials.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parthenon frieze east IV fragment.JPG|thumb|left|Block IV from the east frieze of the Parthenon, with images of seated gods, c. 447–433 BCE.]]
The modern word “[[throne]]” is derived from the ancient Greek ''thronos'' (Greek singular: θρόνος), which was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status or honor.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The colossal chryselephantine statue of [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Zeus at Olympia]], constructed by [[Phidias]] and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 14; NH 5.11.2ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Greek seats included the ''[[klismos]]'', an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design,&lt;ref&gt;Linda Maria Gigante, “Funerary Art,” in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed. Michael Gagarin and Elaine Fantham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), 246.&lt;/ref&gt; the backless stool ([[diphros]]), which existed in most Greek homes,&lt;ref&gt;E. Guhl, and W. Koner, ''Everyday Life in Greek and Roman Times'' (New York: Crescent, 1989), 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and folding stool.&lt;ref&gt;Ole Wanscher, ''Sella Curulis: The Folding Stool, an Ancient Symbol of Dignity'' (Copenhagen: Rosenkilde and Bagger, 1980), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Klinai|kline]], used from the late seventh century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, 253.&lt;/ref&gt; was a multipurpose piece used as a [[bed]], but also as a [[Couch|sofa]] and for reclining during meals.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=43}} It was rectangular and supported on four legs, two of which could be longer than the other, providing support for an armrest or headboard.&lt;ref&gt;Andrianou, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Mattresses, rugs, and blankets may have been used, but there is no evidence for sheets.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=43}}

In general, Greek tables were low and often appear in depictions alongside ''klinai''.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of Greek table had a rectangular top supported on three legs, although numerous configurations exist, including trapezoid and circular.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=42}} Tables in ancient Greece were used mostly for dining purposes – in depictions of banquets, it appears as though each participant would have utilized a single table, rather than a collective use of a larger piece.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Tables also figured prominently in religious contexts, as indicated in vase paintings, for example, the wine vessel associated with Dionysus, dating to around 450 BCE and now housed at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Painter, stamnos, c. 450 BCE. [http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/177 The Art Institute of Chicago, 1889.22].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chest]]s were used for storage of clothes and personal items, and were usually rectangular with hinged lids.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=42}} Chests depicted in terracotta show elaborate patterns and design, including the [[Greek fret]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=43}}

===Ancient Rome===
Roman furniture was based heavily on Greek furniture, in style and construction. In the last few centuries Rome gradually superseded Greece as the foremost culture of Europe, leading eventually to Greece becoming a province of Rome in 146 BCE.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}} Rome thus took over production and distribution of Greek furniture, and the boundary between the two is blurred.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}} The Romans did have some limited innovation outside of Greek influence, and styles distinctly their own.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}

Roman furniture was constructed principally using wood, metal and stone, with marble and limestone used for outside furniture.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}} Very little wooden furniture survives intact, but there is evidence that a variety of woods were used, including maple, citron, beech, oak, and holly.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}} Some imported wood such as satinwood was used for decoration.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}} The most commonly used metal was bronze, of which numerous examples have survived, for example, headrests for couches and metal stools.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}} Similar to the Greeks, [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]] used tenons, dowels, nails, and glue to join wooden pieces together, and also practised veneering.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}

The 1738 and 1748 excavations of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] revealed Roman furniture, preserved in the ashes of the AD 79 [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption of Vesuvius]], to the eighteenth century.

===Medieval Europe===
[[File:Arca de la Batalla de Anghiari (M.A.N. 51936) 01.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] ''[[cassone]]'' from the 15th century]]
In contrast to the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, we have comparatively little evidence of furniture from the 5th to the 15th century.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} Very few extant pieces survive, and evidence in literature is also scarce.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} It is likely that the style of furniture prevalent in late antiquity persisted throughout the [[middle ages]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} For example, a throne similar to that of [[Zeus]] is depicted in a sixth century [[diptych]],{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} while the [[Bayeux tapestry]] shows [[Edward the Confessor]] and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] seated on seats similar to the Roman [[sella curulis]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=35}}

The furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented with carved designs. Along with the other arts, the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century marked a rebirth in design, often inspired by the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition. A similar explosion of design, and renaissance of culture in general occurred in Northern Europe, starting in the fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs that frequently incorporated a profusion of vegetal and scrolling ornament. Starting in the eighteenth century, furniture designs began to develop more rapidly. Although there were some styles that belonged primarily to one nation, such as [[Palladianism]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Louis Quinze]] in [[French furniture]], others, such as the [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were perpetuated throughout Western Europe.

===18th century===
During the eighteenth century, the fashion was set in England by the French art. In the beginning of the century [[Boulle]]
[[File:LatzEncoignure1a.jpg|left|thumb|250px|An [[encoignure]] by royal cabinetmaker [[Jean-Pierre Latz]] circa 1750 is richly ornamented with [[marquetry]] and [[ormolu]].]]
cabinets were at the peak of their popularity and Louis XIV was reigning in France. In this era, most of the furniture had metal and enamelled decorations in it and some of the furniture was covered in inlays of marbles lapis lazuli, and porphyry and other stones. By mid-century this [[Baroque]] style was displaced by the graceful curves, shining [[ormolu]], and intricate [[marquetry]] of the [[Rococo]] style, which in turn gave way around 1770 to the more severe lines of [[Neoclassicism]], modeled after the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome.

===19th century===
[[File:The furniture maker by Ludwig Deutsch.jpg|thumb|250px|The furniture maker by Ludwig Deutsch]]
The nineteenth century is usually defined by concurrent [[revival styles]], including [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]], Neoclassicism, Rococo, and the [[EastHaven Movement]]. The design [[reform]]s of the late century introduced the [[Aesthetic movement]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. [[Art Nouveau]] was influenced by both of these movements.

===Early North American===
This design was in many ways rooted in necessity and emphasizes both form and materials. Early American{{vague|date=May 2015}} chairs and tables are often constructed with turned spindles and chair backs often constructed with steaming to bend the wood. Wood choices tend to be deciduous hardwoods with a particular emphasis on the wood of edible or fruit bearing trees such as cherry or walnut.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Modernism===
[[File:Rietveld chair 1b.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|[[Red and Blue Chair]] (1917), designed by [[Gerrit Rietveld]]]]

The first three-quarters of the twentieth century is often seen as the march towards [[Modernism]]. [[Art Deco]], [[De Stijl]], [[Bauhaus]], [[Wiener Werkstätte Style|Wiener Werkstätte]], and [[Vienna Secession]] designers all worked to some degree within the Modernist idiom. Born from the [[Bauhaus]] and Art Deco/Streamline styles came the post WWII "[[Mid-Century Modern]]" style using materials developed during the war including laminated plywood, plastics, and fiberglass. Prime examples include furniture designed by George Nelson Associates, Charles and Ray Eames, [[Paul McCobb]], Florence Knoll, Harry Bertoia, Eero Saarinen, Harvey Probber, Vladamir Kagan and [[Danish modern]] designers including [[Finn Juhl]] and [[Arne Jacobsen]]. [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] design, intersecting the [[Pop art]] movement, gained steam in the 1960s and 70s, promoted in the 80s by groups such as the Italy-based [[Memphis movement]]. [[Transitional furniture]] is intended to fill a place between Traditional and Modern tastes.

===Ecodesign===
Great efforts from individuals, governments, and companies has led to the manufacturing of products with higher sustainability known as [[Ecodesign]]. This new line of furniture is based on environmentally friendly design. Its use and popularity are increasing each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecodesign Report – The Results of a survey Amongst Australian Industrial Design Consultancies|url=https://www.bigsonline.com/blog/ecodesign-report-results-survey-amongst-australian-industrial-design-consultancies/|website=Big's Furniture Store Las Vegas|publisher=Nobody Beats Big's!|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is [[Live edge]], heralding a return to natural shapes and textures within the home.&lt;ref name=povo&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gray|first=Channing |title=Haute and cool: Fine Furnishings show branches out in 10th year with a bigger spread of classic and cutting-edge pieces|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/305275225/Haute-and-Cool-Fine-Furnishings-Providence-Show-Branches-Out-in-10th-Year

===Asian history===
[[Image:Sendai Tansu.jpg|thumb|Sendai-dansu for kimono, zelkova wood, note the elaborate ironwork, handles on the side for transportation, and lockable compartment]]
[[Asian furniture]] has a quite distinct history. The traditions out of [[India]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]], Indonesia (Bali and Java) and [[Japan]] are some of the best known, but places such as [[Korea]], [[Mongolia]], and the countries of [[South East Asia]] have unique facets of their own.

The use of uncarved wood and bamboo and the use of heavy lacquers are well known Chinese styles. It is worth noting that Chinese furniture varies dramatically from one dynasty to the next.

Traditional Japanese furniture is well known for its [[minimalism|minimalist]] style, extensive use of wood, high-quality craftsmanship and reliance on wood grain instead of painting or thick lacquer. Japanese chests are known as [[Tansu]], known for elaborate decorative iron work, and are some of the most sought-after of Japanese antiques. The antiques available generally date back to the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] and [[Meiji period]]s.

==Types==
{{Main|List of furniture types}}

===For sitting===
[[File:أثاث منزل في بغداد.jpg|thumb]]
Seating is amongst the oldest known furniture types, and authors including [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] regard it as the most important.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2016}} In additional to the functional design, seating has had an important decorative element from ancient times to the present day. This includes carved and sculpted pieces intended as works of art, as well as the styling of seats to indicate social importance, with senior figures or leaders granted the use of specially designed seats.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2016}}

The simplest form of seat is the [[chair]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physique of office chair|url=http://foss-aalborg.dk/de-bedste-kontorstole-i-2016/|website=Foss Alborg|accessdate=8 September 2016|date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a piece of furniture designed to allow a single person to sit down, which has a back and legs, as well as a platform for sitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chair|title=Definition of CHAIR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairs often feature cushions made from various fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9Svso1ZaR9oC&amp;pg=PA30|title=Soft Furnishings|first=Chris|last=Jefferys|date=1 October 2006|publisher=New Holland Publishers|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1843309031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of wood used==
{{Main|List of woods}}
All different types of woods have unique signature marks that can help in easy identification of the type. Both [[hardwood]]s and [[softwood]]s are used in furniture manufacturing, and each has their own specific uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovedesigns.com/woods.html|title=Types of Wood |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Hoove Designs |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most commonly, quality furniture is made out of [[hardwood]] which is made from oak, maple, mahogany, teak, walnut, cherry and birch. Highest quality wood will have been air dried to rid it of its moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://furniture.about.com/od/buyingfurniture/a/woodquality.htm|title=Judge Quality in Wood Furniture |author=Abe Abbas |publisher=About.com |accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GAA games in Sorrento.jpg|right|thumb|Gaelic games are present across the world. This sign in [[Sorrento]], Italy, advertises that Gaelic games are "shown in the bar".]]
'''Gaelic games''' are sports played in [[Ireland]] under the auspices of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA). [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] are the two main games. Other games organised by the GAA include [[Gaelic handball]] (also referred to as [[GAA Handball]] or [[Wallball]]) and [[rounders]].

Women's versions of hurling and football are also played: [[camogie]], organised by the [[Camogie Association of Ireland]], and [[ladies' Gaelic football]], organised by the [[Ladies' Gaelic Football Association]]. While women's versions are not organised by the GAA, they are closely associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moran | first = Mary | authorlink = Mary Moran (camogie) | title = A Game of Our Own: The History of Camogie | publisher = Cumann Camógaíochta | year = 2011 | location = Dublin, Ireland|ISBN = 1908591005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost a million people (977,723) attended 45 GAA senior championships games in 2017 (up 29% in hurling and 22% in football on 2016 figures) combined with attendances at other championship and league games generating Gate receipts of €34,391,635 .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the42.ie/gaa-gate-receipts-3825747-Jan2018/] GAA gate receipts up 13%, annual revenue up €5m and attendances increase by 24%&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaelic football==
{{Further|Gaelic football}}
[[File:Davy Harte.jpg|thumb|Davy Heart and Peadar Andrews 2005 All Ireland Quarter Final]]
Gaelic football is played by teams of 15 on a rectangular grass pitch with H-shaped goals at each end. The primary object is to score by driving the ball through the goals, which is known as a goal (worth 3 points), or by kicking the ball over the bar, which is known as a point (worth 1 point). The team with the highest point score at the end of the match wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/our-games/football/ |title=Football |work=GAA.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705184854/http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/our-games/football/ |archivedate=5 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The female version of the game is known as [[ladies' Gaelic football]] and is similar to the men's game with a few minor rule changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/our-games/ladies-football/ |title=Football for Ladies |work=GAA.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516090704/http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/our-games/ladies-football/ |archivedate=16 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other formats with teams of 7 to 11 players are played in Europe,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gaelicgameseurope.com/|title=Gaelic Games Europe {{!}} Gaelic Athletic Association|website=Gaelic Games Europe|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Middle East, Asia, Argentina and South Africa utilising smaller soccer or rugby pitches .

==Hurling==
{{Further|Hurling}}
Hurling is a stick and ball game played by teams of 15 on a rectangular grass pitch with H-shaped goals at each end. The primary object is to score by driving the ball through the goals or putting the ball over the bar and thereby scoring a point.  Three points is the equivalent of a goal. The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins.  It is over three thousand years old, and is said to be the world's fastest field game, combining skills from lacrosse, field hockey, and baseball in a hard-hitting, highly skilled game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/our-games/hurling/ |title=Hurling |work=GAA.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705191522/http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/our-games/hurling/ |archivedate=5 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The female version of the game is known as [[camogie]] and is very similar to hurling with a few minor rule changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/our-games/camogie/ |title=Camogie |work=GAA.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601190850/http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/our-games/camogie/ |archivedate=1 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other formats with teams of 7 to 11 players are played in Europe,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Middle East, Asia, Argentina and South Africa utilising smaller soccer or rugby pitches .

==Gaelic handball==
{{Further|Gaelic handball}}
Gaelic handball is a game in which two players use their hands to return a ball against a wall. The game is similar to [[American handball]]. There are three codes of handball: 60x30, 40x20 and One Wall. One Wall handball is the most popular international version of handball with it being played in over 30 countries. It is hoped by [[GAA Handball]] that this version of handball will become an Olympic sport. The sport of handball is governed by GAA Handball in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/our-games/handball/ |title=Handball |work=GAA.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626100648/http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/our-games/handball/ |archivedate=26 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rounders ==
{{Further|Rounders}}
Rounders is a bat and ball game which is played in Ireland; a similar version is played in England. Rounders is the least popular of the GAA Gaelic games{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} and is organised by a subdivision of the GAA known as the Rounders Council of Ireland. It is similar to [[softball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/our-games/rounders/ |title=Rounders |work=GAA.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626100703/http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/our-games/rounders/ |archivedate=26 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Gaelic games==
Other Gaelic games such as Gaelic athletics have nearly or completely died out. When founded the GAA organised a number of Gaelic athletics competitions but passed the responsibility to the [[National Athletic and Cycling Association]] in 1922. [[Tailteann Games (Irish Free State)|Tailteann Games]] with Gaelic athletics were held until 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.athleticsireland.ie/content/?page_id=5990|title=Athletic Ireland|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Umbria, jacopo da varazze, leggenda aurea, 1290 ca. 01.jpg|thumb|300px|''Legenda Aurea'', 1290 circa, [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]], Florence]]

[[Image:Stgeorge-dragon.jpg|thumb|The story of [[Saint George and the dragon]] is one of many stories of the [[saint]]s preserved in the ''Golden Legend''.]]

The '''''Golden Legend''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Legenda aurea'' or ''Legenda sanctorum'') is a collection of [[hagiography|hagiographies]] by Blessed [[Jacobus de Varagine]] that was widely read in late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe. More than a thousand manuscripts of the text have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Maddocks, "Pictures for aristocrats: the manuscripts of the ''Légende dorée''", in Margaret M. Manion, Bernard James Muir, eds. ''Medieval texts and images: studies of manuscripts from the Middle Ages'' 1991:2; a study of the systemization of the Latin manuscripts of the ''Legenda aurea'' is B. Fleith, "Le classement des quelque 1000 manuscrits de la Legenda aurea latine  en vue de l'éstablissement d'une histoire de la tradition" in Brenda Dunn-Lardeau, ed. ''Legenda Aurea: sept siècles de diffusion", 1986:19-24&lt;/ref&gt; It was likely compiled around the year 1260, although the text was added to over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;An introduction to the ''Legenda'', its great popular late medieval success and the collapse of its reputation in the 16th century, is Sherry L. Reames, ''The Legenda Aurea: a reexamination of its paradoxical history'', University of Wisconsin, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Houghton WKR 1.3.4 - Saints in glory.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration for ''Golden Legend'', 1493]]
[[Image:Sainte Marguerite et Olibrius.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]] attracts the attention of the Roman prefect, by [[Jean Fouquet]] from an [[illuminated manuscript]]]]
Initially entitled ''Legenda sanctorum'' (''Readings of the Saints''), it gained its popularity under the title by which it is best known. It overtook and eclipsed earlier compilations of abridged legendaria, the ''Abbreviatio in gestis et miraculis sanctorum'' attributed to the Dominican chronicler [[Jean de Mailly]] and the ''Epilogus in gestis sanctorum'' of the Dominican preacher [[Bartholomew of Trent]]. Over eight hundred&lt;ref&gt;Number supplied by Reames 1985:4.&lt;/ref&gt; manuscript copies of the work survive, and when printing was invented in the 1450s, editions appeared quickly, not only in Latin, but also in every major European language. Among ''[[incunabula]]'', printed before 1501, ''Legenda aurea'' was printed in more editions than the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Reames 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first books [[William Caxton]] printed in the [[English language]]; Caxton's version appeared in 1483 and his translation was reprinted, reaching a ninth edition in 1527.&lt;ref name="Vorágine)1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacobus (de Vorágine)|title=The Golden Legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99I3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=16 November 2012|year=1973|publisher=CUP Archive|pages=8–|id=GGKEY:DE1HSY5K6AF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Written in simple, readable Latin, the book was read in its day for its stories. The book is considered the closest to an encyclopaedia of medieval saint lore that survives today; as such it is invaluable to [[art history|art historians]] and medievalists who seek to identify saints depicted in art by their deeds and attributes. Its repetitious nature is explained if Jacobus da Varagine meant to write a compendium of saintly lore for [[sermon]]s and [[preaching]], not a work of popular entertainment.

==Lives of the saints==
The book sought to compile traditional lore about all of the saints [[veneration|venerated]] at the time of its compilation. Jacobus da Varagine typically begins with an (often fanciful) [[etymology]] for the saint's name. An example (in Caxton's translation) shows his method:

{{quote|[[Pope Silvester I|Silvester]] is said of ''sile'' or ''sol'' which is light, and of ''terra'' the earth, as who saith the light of the earth, that is of the church. Or Silvester is said of ''silvas'' and of ''trahens'', that is to say he was drawing wild men and hard unto the faith. Or as it is said ''in glossario'', Silvester is to say green, that is to wit, green in contemplation of heavenly things, and a toiler in labouring himself; he was umbrous or shadowous. That is to say he was cold and refrigate from all concupiscence of the flesh, full of boughs among the trees of heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend/silvester "The Life of St. Sylvester."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925020341/http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend/silvester |date=2012-09-25 }} ''The Golden Legend'' or ''Lives of the Saints.'' Compiled by Jacobus de Varagine. Trans. William Caxton. Ed. [[F. S. Ellis]]. Reproduced at ''www.Aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend'', Augusta State University.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a Latin author, Jacobus da Varagine must have known that ''Silvester'', a relatively common Latin name, simply meant "from the forest". The correct derivation is alluded to in the text, but set out in parallel to fanciful ones that [[lexicography|lexicographers]] would consider quite wide of the mark. Even the "correct" explanations (''silvas'', "forest", and the mention of green boughs) are used as the basis for an [[allegory|allegorical]] interpretation. Jacobus da Varagine's etymologies had different goals from modern etymologies, and cannot be judged by the same standards. Jacobus' etymologies have parallels in [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]'', in which linguistically accurate derivations are set out beside allegorical and figurative explanations.

Jacobus da Varagine then moves on to the saint's life, compiled with reference to the readings from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s [[liturgy]] commemorating that saint; then embellishes the biography with [[supernatural]] tales of incidents involving the saint's life.

===Medieval view of Muhammad===
The chapter "St Pelagius, Pope and the History of the Lombards" begins with the story of St Pelagius, then proceeds to touch upon events surrounding the origin and history of the [[Lombards]] in Europe leading up to the 7th century when the story of [[Muhammad]] begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNWZgIL5ZCoC&amp;pg=PA753#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Golden Legend: Readings on the Saints|first=Jacobus De|last=Varagine|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story then goes on to describe "Magumeth (Mahomet, Muhammad)" as "a false prophet and sorcerer", detailing his early life and travels as a merchant through his marriage to the widow, Khadija and goes on to suggest his "visions" came as a result of epileptic seizures and the interventions of a renegade [[Nestorianism | Nestorian]] monk named [[Bahira|Sergius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNWZgIL5ZCoC&amp;pg=PA754&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Golden Legend: Readings on the Saints|first=Jacobus De|last=Varagine|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter conveys the medieval Christian understanding of the beliefs of [[Saracens]] and other [[Muslims]].

===Miracle tales of relics===
Many of the stories also conclude with [[miracle]] tales and similar wonderlore from accounts of those who called upon that saint for aid or used the saint's [[relic]]s. Such a tale is told of Saint [[Agatha of Sicily|Agatha]]; Jacobus da Varagine has [[paganism|pagans]] in [[Catania]] repairing to the relics of St. Agatha to [[magic (paranormal)|supernaturally]] repel an [[volcano|eruption]] of [[Mount Etna]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And for to prove that she had prayed for the salvation of the country, at the beginning of February, the year after her martyrdom, there arose a great fire, and came from the mountain toward the city of Catania and burnt the earth and stones, it was so fervent. Then ran the paynims to the sepulchre of S. Agatha and took the cloth that lay upon her tomb, and held it abroad against the fire, and anon on the ninth day after, which was the day of her feast, ceased the fire as soon as it came to the cloth that they brought from her tomb, showing that our Lord kept the city from the said fire by the merits of S. Agatha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend/agatha "The Life of St. Agatha."] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120801050601/http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend/agatha |date=2012-08-01 }} ''The Golden Legend'' or ''Lives of the Saints.''

A substantial portion of Jacobus' text was drawn from two [[epitome]]s of collected lives of the saints, both also arranged in the order of the liturgical year, written by members of his [[Dominican order]]: one is [[Jean de Mailly]]'s lengthy ''Abbreviatio in gestis et miraculis sanctorum'' (''Summary of the Deeds and Miracles of the Saints'') and the other is [[Bartholomew of Trent]]'s ''Epilogum in gesta sanctorum'' (''Afterword on the Deeds of the Saints'').&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Maddocks, "Pictures for aristocrats: the manuscripts of the Légende dorée", in Margaret M. Manion and Bernard James Muir, eds.,''Medieval Texts and Images: studies of manuscripts from the Middle Ages'' 1991:2 note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The many extended parallels to text found in [[Vincent de Beauvais]]' ''[[Speculum historiale]]'', the main encyclopedia that was used in the Middle Ages, are attributed by modern scholars to the two authors' common compilation of identical sources, rather than to Jacobus' reading Vincent's encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Stace, tr., ''The Golden Legend: selections'' (Penguin), "Introduction" pp. xii–xvi, reporting conclusions of K. Ernest Geith, (Geith, "Jacques de Varagine, auteur indépendant ou compilateur?" in Brenda Dunn-Lardeau, ed. ''Legenda aurea – 'La Légende dorée'' 1993:17–32) who printed the comparable texts side by side.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 130 more distant sources have been identified for the tales related of the saints in the ''Golden Legend'', few of which have a nucleus in the [[New Testament]] itself; these [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] sources include [[apocrypha]]l texts such as the ''[[Gospel of Nicodemus]]'', and the histories of [[Gregory of Tours]] and [[John Cassian]]. Many of his stories have no other known source. A typical example of the sort of story related, also involving St. Silvester, shows the saint receiving miraculous instruction from [[Saint Peter]] in a [[vision (religion)|vision]] that enables him to [[exorcism|exorcise]] a [[dragon]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this time it happed that there was at Rome a dragon in a pit, which every day slew with his breath more than three hundred men. Then came the bishops of the idols unto the emperor and said unto him: O thou most holy emperor, sith the time that thou hast received Christian faith the dragon which is in yonder fosse or pit slayeth every day with his breath more than three hundred men. Then sent the emperor for S. Silvester and asked counsel of him of this matter. S. Silvester answered that by the might of God he promised to make him cease of his hurt and blessure of this people. Then S. Silvester put himself to prayer, and S. Peter appeared to him and said: "Go surely to the dragon and the two priests that be with thee take in thy company, and when thou shalt come to him thou shalt say to him in this manner: Our Lord Jesus Christ which was born of the Virgin Mary, crucified, buried and arose, and now sitteth on the right side of the Father, this is he that shall come to deem and judge the living and the dead, I commend thee Sathanas that thou abide him in this place till he come. Then thou shalt bind his mouth with a thread, and seal it with thy seal, wherein is the imprint of the cross. Then thou and the two priests shall come to me whole and safe, and such bread as I shall make ready for you ye shall eat.&lt;p&gt;Thus as S. Peter had said, S. Silvester did. And when he came to the pit, he descended down one hundred and fifty steps, bearing with him two lanterns, and found the dragon, and said the words that S. Peter had said to him, and bound his mouth with the thread, and sealed it, and after returned, and as he came upward again he met with two enchanters which followed him for to see if he descended, which were almost dead of the stench of the dragon, whom he brought with him whole and sound, which anon were baptized, with a great multitude of people with them. Thus was the city of Rome delivered from double death, that was from the culture and worshiping of false idols, and from the venom of the dragon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend/silvester "The Life of St. Sylvester."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925020341/http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend/silvester |date=2012-09-25 }} ''The Golden Legend'' or ''Lives of the Saints''.

Jacobus had his limits; he describes the story of [[Saint Margaret of Antioch]] surviving being swallowed by a dragon as "apocryphal and not to be taken seriously" (trans. Ryan, 1.369).

==Perception and legacy==
[[File:Iacopo - Legenda aurea, nel MCCCCLXXXXIX adi V di decembre - 911150 2r.jpg|thumb|upright|''Legenda Aurea'', 1499.]]

===16th-century rejection and 20th-century revival===
The adverse reaction to ''Legenda aurea'' under critical scrutiny in the 16th century was led by scholars who reexamined the criteria for judging hagiographic sources and found ''Legenda aurea'' wanting; prominent among the [[humanism|humanist]]s were two disciples of [[Erasmus]], [[Georg Witzel]], in the preface to his ''Hagiologium'', and [[Juan Luis Vives]] in ''De disciplinis''. Criticism among members of Jacobus' Dominican order were muted by the increased reverence towards the archbishop, which culminated in his beatification in 1815. The rehabilitation of ''Legenda aurea'' in the 20th century, now interpreted as a mirror of the heartfelt pieties of the 13th century, is attributed&lt;ref&gt;Reames 1985:18ff.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Téodor de Wyzewa]], whose retranslation into French, and its preface, have been often reprinted.

===Editions and translations ===
[[Image:Felicianusandprimus.jpg|thumb|right|Saints [[Primus and Felician]], from a 14th-century manuscript of the ''Golden Legend'']]
The critical edition of the Latin text has been edited by Giovanni Paolo Maggioni (Florence: SISMEL 1998). In 1900, the Caxton version was updated into more modern English by [[Frederick Startridge Ellis]], and published in seven volumes. Jacobus da Varagine's original was translated into French around the same time by [[Téodor de Wyzewa]]. A modern English translation of the ''Golden Legend'' has been published by William Granger Ryan, {{ISBN|0-691-00153-7}} and {{ISBN|0-691-00154-5}} (2 volumes).

A modern translation of the ''Golden Legend'' is available from [[Fordham University]]'s Medieval Sourcebook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/goldenlegend''The Golden Legend''].

[[File:Olaus Rudbeck Sr (portrait by Martin Mijtens Sr, 1696).jpg|right|thumb|[[Olof Rudbeck]], a 17th-century spokesman for Gothicismus.]]
[[File:Erik Gustaf Geijer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] was a member of the 19th-century Gothic League (or the [[Geatish Society]]), which propagated the now-familiar image of the [[Viking]] as a heroic Norseman.]]

'''Gothicism''' or '''Gothism''' ({{lang-sv|Göticism}}; {{lang-la|Gothicismus}}) was a [[cultural movement]] in [[Sweden]], centered on the belief in the glory of the Swedish [[Geats]], who were identified with the [[Goths]]. The founders of the movement were [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]] and the brothers [[Johannes Magnus|Johannes]] and [[Olaus Magnus]]. The belief continued to hold power in the 17th century, when Sweden was a great power following the [[Thirty Years' War]], but lost most of its sway in the 18th. It was renewed by the [[Viking revival]] and [[Romantic nationalism]] in the early 19th century, this time with the [[Vikings]] as heroic figures.

==Origins==
The name is derived from the Gothicists' belief that the Goths had originated from Sweden, based on [[Jordanes]]' account of a [[Goths|Gothic]] ''[[urheimat]]'' in [[Scandinavia]] ([[Scandza]]). The Gothicists took pride in the Gothic tradition that the [[Ostrogoth]]s and their king [[Theodoric the Great]], who assumed power in the [[Roman Empire]], had Scandinavian ancestry. This pride was expressed as early as the [[medieval]] [[chronicle]]s, where chroniclers wrote about the Goths as the ancestors of the Scandinavians, and the idea was used by [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]] at the [[Council of Basel]] to argue that the Swedish monarchy was the foremost in Europe. It also permeated the writings of the Swedish writer [[Johannes Magnus]] (''Historia de omnibus gothorum sueonumque regibus'') as well as those of his brother [[Olaus Magnus]] (''[[Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus]]''). Both had a strong influence on contemporary scholarship in Sweden.

Some scholars in Denmark attempted to identify the Goths with the [[Jutes]]; however, these ideas did not lead to the same widespread cultural movement in Danish society as it did in the Swedish. In contrast with the Swedes, the Danes of this era did not forward claims to political legitimacy based on assertions that their country was the original homeland of the Goths or that the conquest of the Roman Empire was proof of their own country's military valour and power through history.&lt;ref&gt;Sondrup, Steven P. and Virgil Nemoianu (2004). ''Nonfictional Romantic Prose: Expanding Borders''.  In the International Comparative Literature Association's ''History of Literatures in European Languages'' series. John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2004, {{ISBN|90-272-3451-5}}, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, Danes and Swedes competed for the collection and publication of [[Iceland]]ic [[manuscript]]s, [[Norse saga]]s, and the two ''[[Edda]]s''. In Sweden, the Icelandic manuscripts became part of an origin myth and were seen as proof that the greatness and heroism of the ancient [[Geat]]s had been passed down through the generations to the current population. This pride culminated in the publication of [[Olaus Rudbeck]]'s treatise ''[[Atland eller Manheim]]'' (1679–1702), in which he claimed that [[Sweden]] was identical to [[Atlantis]].

==Romantic nationalism==
During the 18th century, Swedish Gothicism had sobered somewhat, but it revived during the period of [[Romantic nationalism]] from {{circa}} 1800 onwards, with [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] and [[Esaias Tegnér]] in the [[Geatish Society]].

In [[Denmark]], Romantic nationalism led writers such as [[Johannes Ewald]], [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] (whose translation of ''[[Beowulf]]'' into Danish was the first into a modern language) and [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger]] to take a renewed interest in Old Norse subjects.  In other parts of Europe, interest in Norse mythology, history and language was represented by the Englishmen [[Thomas Gray]], [[John Keats]] and [[William Wordsworth]], and the Germans [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]].

==Architecture==
In [[Scandinavia]]n [[architecture]], Gothicism had its prime in the 1860s and 1870s, but it continued until {{circa}} 1900. The interest in Old Norse subjects led to the creation of a special architecture in wood inspired by [[stave church]]es, and it was in [[Norway]] that the style had its largest impact. The details that are often found in this style are dragon heads, from which it is often called [[Dragestil|''dragon style'']], false [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s, lathed [[colonnade]]s, protruding lofts and a ridged roof.

The original gros created by St Louis weighed about 4.52 g of nearly pure silver, and was valued at one [[Sou (coin)|sou]], that is 12 [[French denier|deniers]] or 1/20 of a [[livre tournois]]. Unlike the gold [[écu]] that was [[Mint (coin)|minted]] in small numbers, mostly for prestige reasons, the gros was a very common coin, and very widely copied by non royal mints.

'''Guatitas''' (''[little] guts'' or ''[little] bellies'', from {{lang-es|Guata}}; "Gut/Belly"), or '''guatitas criollas''', is a popular dish in [[Chile]] and in [[Ecuador]], where it is considered a national dish.

Guatitas is essentially a [[stew]] whose main ingredient is pieces of [[tripe]] (cow stomach), known locally as "guatitas". The tripe is often cleaned several times in a lemon-juice brine, after which it is cooked for a long time until the meat is tender. Then it is allowed to cool and finely chopped. There are various vegetarian versions of the dish in which [[Wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]] is substituted for tripe. Other variations use strong-tasting fish such as [[tuna]]. The traditional Ecuadorian recipe is served hot and accompanied by potatoes and a peanut sauce.

The dish is often considered an acquired taste. Because of its strong taste, it is sometimes served in small quantities.

In Ecuador, it is believed that guatita helps relieve hangover symptoms.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Longos: |author=Chiluisa, J.J.|date=1998|publisher=Fundación de Investigaciones Andino Amazónicas|isbn=9789978404119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUmUpoepTa8C|page=90|accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ultimasnoticias.ec/noticiaUN.asp?id_noticia=23306&amp;id_seccion=5&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it is often served by restaurants early on Saturday and Sunday mornings.

[[File:Terno típico de Yucatán.jpg|thumb|200px|Yucatecas dressed with "terno" of huipil, traditional costume of Yucatán, with which the [[Jarana yucateca]] is danced.]]
'''Huipil''' {{IPA-es|ˈwipil|}} (from the [[Nahuatl]] word ''[[Aztec clothing|huīpīlli]]'' {{IPA-nah|wiːˈpiːlːi|}}) is the most common traditional garment worn by indigenous women from central [[Mexico]] to [[Central America]].

It is a loose-fitting tunic, generally made from two or three rectangular pieces of fabric which are then joined together with stitching, ribbons or fabric strips, with an opening for the head and, if the sides are sewn, openings for the arms. Traditional huipils, especially ceremonial ones, are usually made with fabric woven on a [[Loom#Back strap loom|backstrap loom]] and are heavily decorated with designs woven into the fabric, embroidery, ribbons, lace and more. However, some huipils are also made from commercial fabric.

Lengths of the huipil can vary from a short blouse-like garment or long enough to reach the floor. The style of traditional huipils generally indicates the ethnicity and community of the wearer as each have their own methods of creating the fabric and decorations. Some huipils have intricate and meaningful designs. Ceremonial huipils are the most elaborate and are reserved for weddings, burials, women of high rank and even to dress the statues of saints.

==History==
[[File:Huipil-de-la-malinche.jpg|thumb|left|The "''La Malinche''" huipil]]
The huipil has been worn by indigenous women of the [[Mesoamerica]]n region (central Mexico into Central America) of both high and low social rank since well before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|arrival of the Spanish to the Americas]]. It remains the most common female indigenous garment still in use.&lt;ref name="mexdes"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-huipil-una-prenda-secular.html |author=Ruth Lechuga |title= ''El huipil, una prenda secular'' |publisher= Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 5, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prendas"&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=549 |title=Huipil |work=Popularte |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Veracruz, Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017125607/http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=549 |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

It is most often seen in the Mexican states of [[Chiapas]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], [[Quintana Roo]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Tabasco]], [[Campeche]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Michoacán]] (where it is called a ''huanengo''), [[Veracruz]] and [[Morelos]] .&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt; In Central America it is most often used among the [[Maya peoples|Mayas]] in [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="florida"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/maya/maya5.htm |title= The Huipil |work= Images of the Maya |publisher= Florida Museum of Natural History |accessdate=May 5, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:19th-century Huipil (Victoria and Albert Museum).jpg|thumb|Huipil, 1875-1890, Warp-faced plain weave cotton, Patzun, Guatemala (probably) V&amp;A Museum no.T.23-1931]]
After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] and subsequent Spanish expansion, the huipil endured but it evolved, incorporating elements from other regions and Europe.&lt;ref name="florida"/&gt; One of the oldest known huipils in existence is the "''La Malinche''", named such because it was believed to have been worn by [[La Malinche|Hernán Cortés’ interpreter]] as it looks much like ones in depictions of her in the [[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]] and the [[Florentine Codex]]. However, [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon 14 tests]] date it to the 18th century. It is exceptional not only for its age but there is none like it in any collection and it is larger than usual at 120 by 140 cm. It is made of cotton with feathers, wax and gold thread. The design is dominated by an image of a double headed eagle, showing both indigenous and Spanish influence. It is part of the collection of the ''[[Museo Nacional de Antropología]]''.&lt;ref name="malinche"&gt; {{cite news |title= ''Espectadores podrán conocer el enigma del huipil de La Malinche'' |author= Ana Mónica Rodríguez |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2011/04/27/cultura/a04n1cul |newspaper= La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=April 27, 2011 |page=4 |accessdate=May 5, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Some huipils, such as those from the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] show Asian influence due to cloth brought from the [[Philippines]] .&lt;ref name="novias"&gt; {{cite news |title= Mexicanisimas novias |author=Bernardo Hernandez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=April 24, 1997 |page=30 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Very Mexican brides }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the huipil began to be worn with other garments, especially European skirts, during the colonial period. This led to changes in the garment itself and how it was used. In some cases, the huipil became shorter, to function as a kind of blouse rather than a dress. In the same region, the huipil also evolved into a long flowing and sometimes voluminous head covering which frames the face.&lt;ref name="novias"/&gt;

To this day, the most traditional huipils are made with hand woven cloth on a back strap loom. However, the introduction of commercial fabric made this costly and many indigenous women stopped making this fabric, or making simpler versions. By the early 1800s, women began to wear undecorated huipils or European style blouses. By the end of the 19th century, most Maya women had forgotten the technique of [[brocade]] weaving entirely.&lt;ref name="florida"/&gt;

The huipil endures in many indigenous communities, if not as an everyday garment, as one for ceremonies or special occasions. When a woman puts on a huipil, especially a ceremonial or very traditional one, it is a kind of ritual. She becomes the center of a symbolic world as her head passes through the neck opening. With her arms, she forms a cross and is surrounded by myth as between heaven and the underworld.&lt;ref name="artshistory"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=845583&amp;id_subseccion=694068 |title= El Huipil |publisher= Artes e Historia México magazine|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 5, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:XochisWeavers40.JPG|thumb|left|Stitching together two panels in Xochistlahuaca]]
The huipil is a tunic-like garment made by stitching together anywhere from one to five pieces of cloth. The most common fiber is cotton, but there are those made from wool and silk as well.&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt; Most huipils are made from two or three pieces, which are usually the same size, with one exception being those from the highlands of Chiapas, where the center piece is wider than the side ones. The panels are not sewn together in the normal sense with seams but rather they are joined using ribbons, small strips of cloth or complicated stitching which has the edges of the panels touching or almost touching. This adds a layer of decoration to the garment.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt;
[[File:Maya. Woman's Blouse or Huipil, 2005.15.1.jpg|thumbnail|Maya. ''Woman's Blouse or Huipil'', [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Most classic huipils are wider than they are long although there has been a reduction in width in recent years.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt; Huipils can be as short as waist length or can reach to the ankles or anywhere in between, but most fall just above or just below the knee.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt; Long or short, it is not designed to be a close-fitting garment.&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt; The neckline can be round, oval, square or a simple slit.&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt; Most are sewn on the sides, leaving an opening in the upper part for the arms to pass through. Some huipils are not sewn on the sides, especially the very short ones.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/168766/Womans_Blouse_or_Huipil |title= Collections: Arts of the Americas: Woman's Blouse or Huipil |publisher= Brooklyn Museum |accessdate=May 5, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;
While huipils today are made from commercial cloth, the most traditional are made from hand woven fabric made on a backstrap loom.&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt; The pieces to be used to make the huipil are woven to size and are never cut.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="florida"/&gt; Despite its simplicity, the backstrap loom permits more types of techniques and designs to be woven into the cloth than other types of looms.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt; Most of the hand woven fabric have designs woven into them, especially cloth destined for ceremonial huipils. The decorative elements can signify history, cultural identity, something personal about the wearer and more.&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt; Since most indigenous come from agricultural societies, clothing designs generally relate to the natural world.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"/&gt; The most complicated designs are generally known only to a few older master weavers.&lt;ref name="florida"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fonart"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.fonart.gob.mx/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=131&amp;Itemid=143 |title= Huipil, un simbolismo que se ha trasmitido de generación en generación |publisher= [[FONART]] |date=December 16, 2011 |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 5, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt; In addition to designs embedded into the fabric, other decorative elements can include embroidery, ribbon, feathers, lace and more.&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt;

The making of traditional huipils is an important cultural and economic activity for the [[Amuzgo people|Amuzgos]], especially in [[Xochistlahuaca]] where most people still wear traditional clothing. Girls begin learning the craft when they are young, learning techniques and designs from their mothers and grandmothers. The weaving is an important source of income as agriculture is not enough to meet most families’ needs. While they work on other items such as tablecloths and other items of clothing, the most popular and most valued remains the huipil.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; Amuzgo women have achieved a certain level of fame, with weavers such as [[Florentina López de Jesús]] winning recognition at the 2001 [[UNESCO]] handcraft competition for [[Latin America]] and Caribbean.&lt;ref name="reclaman"&gt; {{cite news |title= Reclaman indigenas apoyo |author=Lupita Aguilar |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=February 28, 2004 |page=4 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Indigenous demand support }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;

==Variations==
[[File:HuipilsMAP.jpg|thumb|Huipils on sale at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]][[File:Embroidered "Huipiles" Tlapaneca Tribe.png|thumb|Huipils of the [[Tlapanec people]] [[circa|c.]] 1908]]
Traditional huipils generally identify the indigenous group and a community of the wearer as each has its own designs for both weaving and embroidering.&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="florida"/&gt; Some communities, such as [[Jamiltepec]] in Oaxaca, have a taboo against huipils made there being worn by women from other areas.&lt;ref name="novias"/&gt;

Except for very long huipils, they are generally worn with other items of clothing such as a skirt or slip. Most huipils hang loose but some can be tied at the waist or can be tucked into a skirt like a blouse.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt; In some cases, such as in [[San Juan Copala]], Oaxaca, the extra length of the huipil is rolled up onto the waist when worn with a skirt.&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt;

Women commonly have an everyday huipil and those worn only on special occasions such as weddings.&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt; Decorative elements are often arranged in horizontal bands but those with vertical orientation are found as well. In a number of indigenous communities, extravagant huipils made for a woman’s wedding is then carefully put away and stored to be used later for her funeral. In others, a special huipil is begun when a woman reaches a certain age for this purpose.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; Ceremonial huipils are also made to dress images of saints. During festivals, these saints can be dressed in many layers of huipils, giving them a fattened appearance.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;

[[Cuetzalan]], Puebla has an annual coffee and huipil festival called the Feria del Huipil y Café, which began in 1949.&lt;ref name="estrene"&gt; {{cite news |title= Estrene un huipil y tomese un cafe |author=Judith Segura |newspaper=Refoma |location=Mexico City |date=September 29, 1996 |page=11 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Show off the huipil and drink coffee }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The garment is common among the various Mayan groups. For Mayan women in Guatemala, huipil designs on the front back and shoulders can identify which type of Maya and from what community.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"/&gt; Mayan ceremonial huipils are worn only by the statues of saints and the wives of religious officials.&lt;ref name="florida"/&gt;

[[Indigenous people of Oaxaca|Chinanteca]] huipils are elaborate with the entire garment covered in woven and embroidered geometric designs in various colors, with the edges further decorated with ribbons.&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bvelasco"&gt; {{cite news |title= El Huipil |author=Beatriz Velasco |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=September 7, 2002 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title= }} &lt;/ref&gt; In [[San Lucas Ojitlán|Ojitlán]], Oaxaca, Chinanteca women wear special huipils for their wedding, divided into three classes. The first is called “gala” or “red” which used to be the traditional wedding dress. However, because of its cost, few families can afford it. The second type is called “pavo” which is used for special occasions. It is similar to the first but with a less intense red and with smaller designs. The third type, called “pájaros y palomas” (birds and doves) is the most economical of the three and can be found fairly easily in markets. It is white with figures of birds and other animals in vivid and contrasting colors. This used to be reserved for women of middle age or older but it has since been adopted by many.&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt;

The indigenous women of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec are known for wearing two huipils. The first is a short velvet huipil with is heavily embroidered with floral motifs and a second one special occasion, usually white, which frames the face then extends over the head covering the neck and shoulders.&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bvelasco"/&gt; The blouse huipil has a length of only about 60 cm and shows modern, European and even Asian influence and is generally worn with a voluminous European style skirt which is also heavily decorated. The head covering is called a “huipil de tapar” (covering huipil) or a bidaniro.&lt;ref name="novias"/&gt;

The huipils of Santa María Magdalena, Chiapas are rich in symbolism with images of gods, flowers, frogs and other images with mythological importance. It also includes a set of symbols which serve as a kind of signature of the weaver. The ceremonial huipil of Magdalenas has designs that represent the universe in the form of a cross with east represented on the right shoulder and west on the left. The south is represented on the chest and north on the back. Upon dressing, the woman becomes the center of the universe. This huipil is used only by women of the highest social rank and it is also used to dress statues of saints.&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt;

[[Amuzgo textiles|Amuzgo huipils]] are made with brocade fabric.&lt;ref name="bvelasco"/&gt; Amuzgo huipils have a sophisticated set of designs based on animals, plants, geometric shapes and more.&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt; Some of the designs are not obvious, such as the use of two connected triangles to represent butterflies, but all have a particular significance.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt;

The ceremonial huipil of [[Zinacantán]], Chiapas is also distinguished by its manufacture and symbolism. It is made of white cotton with a square neckline or with a vertical opening with a button fastener. The chest area is marked off with a red line inside of which are white chicken feathers delicately fastened with white, blue or green thread. The lower border has fringe made of the same materials and colors. It is the only garment in Mexico which uses the pre Hispanic art of featherwork today. This huipil is often used for weddings as it is believed that it ensures a good marriage.&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt; Other white wedding huipils are found in [[Pinotepa Nacional]], Chopan and [[San Juan Cotzocon|Cotzocón]] in Oaxaca.&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt; In Pinotepa Nacional, decorative elements include animals, flowers, human figures, [[fretwork]], moons, suns, fish and insects.&lt;ref name="novias"/&gt;

The ceremonial huipils of the [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzils]] have maintained aspects of pre Hispanic feather art with white feathers found on the chest and lower hem.&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt;

In [[Ocotepec, Chiapas|Ocotepec]] and Cuquila in Oaxaca, which are high in the [[Mixtec Region, Oaxaca|Mixtec mountains]], there are huipils made of wool to combat the cold with cotton ones usually for festive occasions.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;

[[Yalaltec people|Yalaltec]] huipils in Oaxaca are very simple with decoration only on a chest and back panel with various colors and some fringe.&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prendas"/&gt;

==History==
In 1955, the list that came to be called List 99 was started by the [[Home Office Consultancy Service]].{{sfn|Erooga|2012|p=47}}

(In 2000, a similar but distinct list was created by the [[Protection of Children Act 1999]].&lt;ref name="lishman"/&gt;{{sfn|GallowayHouston|2008|p=113}}{{sfn|Erooga|2012|p=48}}{{sfn|Finch|2001|p=24}})

The [[Bichard Enquiry]] (2003)&lt;ref name="lishman"/&gt; resulted in a report (2004){{sfn|GallowayHouston|2008|p=115}} that noted shortcomings in the use of List 99.&lt;ref name="lishman"/&gt;{{sfn|GallowayHouston|2008|p=115}}

As of 2007, List 99 contained approximately 5000 names.{{sfn|GallowayHouston|2008|p=124}}

In January&lt;ref name="communitycare"/&gt; or October{{sfn|Erooga|2012|p=48}} 2009, List 99 and some other, similar lists, were replaced by the Children's Barred List, which was created under the [[Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006]] and which was maintained by the [[Independent Safeguarding Authority]] (ISA).{{sfn|Erooga|2012|p=48}}&lt;ref name="communitycare"/&gt;

The ISA merged with the [[Criminal Records Bureau]] in 2012 to form the [[Disclosure and Barring Service]].&lt;ref name="merger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-disclosure-and-barring-service-is-created|title=The Disclosure and Barring Service is created|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusion==
Under the Protection of Children Act 1999, people were placed onto List 99 if they had been convicted of, or had received a caution for, an offence against a child.&lt;ref name="lishman"/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, List 99 was not primarily concerned with child protection, but section 142 allows the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] to prohibit certain persons from working in schools. Section 143 prohibits a person from arranging to hire any other person who is
subject to a direction under section 142 to work in a school.&lt;ref name="solic"&gt;http://www.mjsol.co.uk/resources/library/statutes/education-act-2002/ Education Act 2002, Malcolm Johnson &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults convicted of serious sexual offences committed against children under the age of 16 since 1995 were automatically placed on List 99.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Additional reasons for inclusion were sexual or violent behaviour towards children, abuses of trust, drug offences, any violent crime (for example, conviction of rioting or [[football hooliganism]]), stealing school property and deception in job applications.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Medical conditions such as drug or alcohol abuse and mental illness were grounds for exclusion.&lt;ref name="sundaytimes" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5929">'''Interdiscourse''' is the implicit or explicit relations that a [[discourse]] has to other discourses. '''Interdiscursivity''' is the aspect of a discourse that relates it to other discourses. [[Norman Fairclough]] prefers the concept "orders of discourse". Interdiscursivity is often mostly an analytic concept, e.g. in Foucault and Fairclough. Interdiscursivity has close affinity to [[recontextualisation]] because interdiscourse often implies that elements are imported from another discourse.

The meaning of interdiscourse varies. It denotes at least three levels:

# In Courtine interdiscursivity means that ''a discourse has a relation to another discourse''. That is, a meaning which is close to the meaning of [[intertextuality]].
# In [[Norman Fairclough]] and Linell interdiscursive denotes ''relations between types of discourse'' such as genres.
# In [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Marc Angenot]], interdiscursive &lt;ref&gt;constellation/configuration interdiscursive, Foucault 1969: 88, 206-8&lt;/ref&gt; denotes ''relations between discursive formations'', that is, between large heterogeneous discursive entities, such as natural history and political economy during enlightenment. In [[Michel Foucault]], interdiscourse is differences and equalities across [[discourse|discursive formations]].

An example (where 1. corresponds to a., etc.) illustrates the three levels: A minister of environment speaks in the parliament about a proposal.

*a. She refers to other specific speeches in the parliament about the proposal.
*b. She refers to a memorandum from her civil servants.
*c. She refers to scientific reports supporting the proposal.

The example illustrates that 2. and 3. are specific cases of 1, in the sense a-c all relate to another discourse. To avoid this, level 1. might be defined as relations to other discourses ''within'' the same discursive formation and type of discourse. Consequently, the definition of the levels depends on the definition of [[discourse|discursive formation]] and types of discourse, and the three levels may collapse to the extent that these concepts are not conceived. In short, the stratification of interdiscourse depends on the stratification of discourse.

==Power, ideology and interdiscursive configuration==

Level 2. and 3. may be conceived as particularly salient. This is explained in [[Marc Angenot]] and Bruce by reference to [[Bakhtin]]: In [[Bakhtin]]'s [[dialogism]], the utterance is the natural meaningful and finalised unit of speech, which others are supposed to respond to, that is, others ''interpret the utterance by situating it in a discursive context''. But, an utterance may be interpreted (contextualised) in various ways, and interdiscourse and interdiscursivity denote how certain such interpretations (and relations to other discourses) are socially more privileged than others. Since interdiscourse privileges certain interpretations, it has a close affinity to the concepts of [[ideology]], [[hegemony]] and [[power (sociology)]]. For Bakhtin/Voloshinov, signs are a reality that refracts another reality, that is, signs are ideological.&lt;ref&gt;Voloshinov 1973: 10&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the embedding of a discourse in an interdiscourse is an ideological interpretation of the discourse.

In [[Michel Foucault]], interdiscursivity is not bound to [[ideology]], but is a more open concept for analysing relations between [[discourse|discursive formations]], that is, mapping their interdiscursive configuration. Such analyses constitute a part of his [[discourse analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Foucault 1969: 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;

The cogent and restrictive character of the interdiscourse is reflected in the concept of the ''primacy of interdiscourse''.&lt;ref&gt;Maingueneau 1991: 20&lt;/ref&gt; The interdiscourse is the sayable, the opposite of what cannot be enunciated (l'inénoncable). But, the interdiscourse has also primacy in the sense that it ''defines the relations between discursive entities (or formations) that are constitutive of the discursive entities''. What is acceptable discourse, is in many respects a matter of interdiscursivity at level 2 and 3, because the interdiscursive import and export relations constitute a worksharing between the discursive entities, and this frames what is acceptable discourse within each discursive entity: Generally, a discourse has little authority over what other discourses are assumed to speak of and will therefore accept imported form and content from the other discourses. On the other hand, when a discourse exports content to other discourses, there are expectations as to the exported form and content. Thus, the interdiscursive system shapes the discourses.

{{nihongo|'''Kiseru'''|煙管|''kiseru''}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]] traditionally used for smoking a small serving (about 25 mg) of ''kizami'', a finely shredded [[tobacco]] product resembling hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Typically the mouth piece and bowl are made from metal, with a tubular shaft of wood or [[bamboo]] stretching in between. The bowl is much smaller than that of western-style pipes.  Because each kiseru is basically a rod with metal ends, extremely long kiseru could be carried as weapons, especially by the gangster-like [[kabukimono]] samurai of [[Edo period]] Japan.  Many kiseru have been engraved with elaborate details by skilled artisans and were a status symbol for the owner.

Tobacco has been known in Japan since the 1570s at the earliest. By the early 17th century, kiseru had become popular enough to even be mentioned in some Buddhist textbooks for children. The kiseru evolved along with the equipment and use of [[incense]] associated with the Japanese incense ceremony: [[Japanese incense#Kōdō|kōdō]]:
*The ''kō-bon'', an incense tray, became the ''tabako-bon'', a tobacco tray
*the incense burner evolved into a charcoal fire pot for lighting tobacco with hot air
*The incense pot became a jar to contain the ash.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jti.co.jp/sstyle/trivia/know/episode/2005/02/02.html Japan Tobacco Incorporated official website. accessed Aug 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
During a smoking session, the smoker would put a ball of stringy ''kizami'' tobacco in the bowl, light it at the charcoal fire, then dump the ash into the ash container.

During the [[Edo period]] weapons were frequently used as objects to flaunt one's financial status. Since commoners were prohibited to carry sharper weapons, an elaborate kiseru carried slung from the waist often served the purpose. After the [[Meiji restoration]] and the abolishment of the caste system, many craftsmen who previously had worked on decorating swords moved on to designing kiseru and [[netsuke]] for tobacco pouches. 

The word "kiseru" today is more commonly used to refer to the practice of defrauding the railway system by buying two cheap tickets to get past the entrance and exit gates while not paying for the distance between them. This is likened to a kiseru as there is only metal at the ends, and nothing in the middle, a metaphor indicating that money (metal) only covers the beginning and end.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

== Plot and setting ==
{{Main article|List of Legendz characters}}
The Legendz anime moves away from the [[Pokémon]]-esque "gotta catch em all" theme and monster training aspects and deals more with the overall background of the monster characters and their story. The Legendz anime opens with the discovery of the "Soul Dolls" which contain legendary creatures of incredible power within them. The Dark Wiz company (DWC) wants access to all of them for unknown reasons, but four of the Soul Dolls go missing. The majority of the anime takes place in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], with the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] as a much-featured landmark.

== Reception ==
''[[The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917]]'' makes note of the similarities to ''[[Dragon Drive]]'' in the introduction of Shu and Shiron. It also notes the similarities to ''[[Pokémon]]'' except with dragons and director Daichi's "stylistic similarities" to ''[[Grrl Power]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917 | publisher=Stone Bridge Press |author1=Clements, Jonathan  |author2=McCarthy, Helen | year=2006 | pages=362 | isbn=978-1-933330-10-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The manga review compendium ''Manga: The Complete Guide'' praised the "elaborate universe" and "quirky artwork", but noted that the creatures were "bland".&lt;ref name="Thompson2012"&gt;{{cite book|title=Manga: The Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GvEFDD4rdWMC&amp;pg=PT657|date=3 July 2012|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9780345539441|pages=657–658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of an topical guide to academic disciplines:

An '''academic discipline''' or '''field of study''' is known as a branch of [[knowledge]]. It is [[education|taught]] as an accredited part of [[higher education]]. A scholar's discipline is commonly defined and recognized by a [[faculty (division)|university faculties.]] That person will be accredited by [[learned society|learned societies]] to which he or she belongs along with the [[academic journal]]s in which he or she publishes. However, no formal criteria exist for defining an academic discipline.

Disciplines varies between universities and programs. These discipline will have well-defined rosters of journals and conferences supported by a few universities and publications. A discipline may have branches, that are called sub-disciplines.

There is no consensus on how some academic disciplines should be classified (e.g., whether [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] are disciplines of [[social science]]s or fields within the [[humanities]]). More generally, the proper criteria for organizing knowledge into disciplines are also open to debate.

'''Metarealism''' is a direction in [[Russian poetry]] and art that was born in the 1970s to the 1980s. The term was first used by [[Mikhail Epstein|Mikhail Epshtein]], who coined it in 1981 and made it public in the Soviet magazine "Voprosy Literatury" in 1983; see below his "Theses on Metarealism and Conceptualism" from 1983 and the following years [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.concept.metareal.html] Also: Third Wave: The New Russian Poetry. Ed. K. Johnson &amp; S. M. Ashby. Preface by M. Epshtein, A. Wachtel, [[Alexei Parshchikov|A. Parshchikov]]. University of Michigan Press, 1992 {{ISBN|0-472-06415-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;10, 53, 184 [https://books.google.com/books?id=czhO4m4yjZUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA173&amp;lpg=RA1-PA173&amp;dq=metarealism+poetry&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9zVPX-rMeG&amp;sig=gKOXtyHheDWHsGEgc15Vh1Gknf4#PPP1,M1], Tom Epstein's essay «Metarealism» in the anthology Crossing Centuries: The New Generations in Russian Poetry. Ed. High, John. NY: Talisman House Pub., 2000 {{ISBN|1-883689-90-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-883689-90-2}}, p.&amp;nbsp;87-89, and [[Marjorie Perloff]] "Russian Postmodernism: An Oxymoron?" in Postmodern Culture, Volume 3, # 2, January 1993 [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/postmodern_culture/v003/3.2perloff.html].

M. Epshtein insists that in its philosophic dimension metarealism is "[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] realism," while "stylistically" metarealism is "[[metaphorical]]" realism. (See the most detailed explanation and exposition of this term in Epshtein's articles "Theses on Metarealism and Conceptualism" [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.concept.metareal.html], "A Catalogue of the New Poetries" (Russian version) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904005720/http://modernpoetry.by.ru/proekt/epshtein.htm |date=September 4, 2007 }} and in its English version [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.catalog.poetry.html] Thus, "meta" means both "through" and "beyond" the reality that we all can see; hence, "metarealism" is the realism of the hyperphysical nature of things. The main expression of its essence is given through a non-visual [[metaphor]] or, according to another Epshtein's term, a "metabola" (rather than [[hyperbole]]), that means "transfer" or "transition," opening many dimensions. [See part 3 in {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904005720/http://modernpoetry.by.ru/proekt/epshtein.htm |date=September 4, 2007 }} "Metabola" is different from the [[symbol]] or a "visual" metaphor, because it assumes the interosculation of realities. See: M.Epshtein. After the Future: the Paradoxes of Postmodernism &amp; Contemporary Russian Culture. [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1995, 416 p.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|0-87023-973-2}}, {{ISBN|0-87023-974-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;40–50. Metarealism has very little to do with [[surrealism]], since it appeals to the [[superconscious]] and not to the [[subconscious]], thus opening up a many-dimensional perception of the world.

Metarealism further gained traction after it became a subject of the House of Artists debate at an exhibition of the [[Hyperreality|Hyperrealists]], where its utility was discussed as a new method of creation to overcome traditional realism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge Communication: Transparency, Democracy, Global Governance|last=Mesaros|first=Caludiu|publisher=Editura Universității de Vest|year=2011|isbn=9789731253497|location=|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==What is metarealism?==

[http://www.metarealism.com Metarealism] is synonymous to metaconscience, which means beyond psychological consciousness, beyond a subjective psychological polarized view of reality. Metarealism seeks to depict the reality which exists beyond that psychological subjective perspective. Metarealism proposes not only to communicate further than the pictorial aspect of the perception of other dimensions of reality, but also the essence of those dimensions and their relation to us as human beings. Metarealism then becomes a tool for the evolution of consciousness; just like in the old days when artists painted sacred art to depict their vision of the reality they perceived, through their spiritual interpretation of other dimensions. Thus, Epstein explained that the entire history of world art is the premise and source of metarealism, particularly its condensed codes, encyclopedic summaries, and extracts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|last2=Genis|first2=Alexander|last3=Vladiv-Glover|first3=Slobodanka|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2016|isbn=9781782388647|location=New York|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, metabola or metabole is derived from the dictionary and a microencyclopedia of culture, compressed and translated from one language to another so that it pertains to a reality consisted of interpenetration of different consubstantial realities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Epstein, metarealism is an attempt to return to the word the fullness of its [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] and transcendent meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After the Future: The Paradoxes of Postmodernism and Contemporary Russian Culture|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1995|isbn=0870239732|location=Amherst|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metarealism could be also considered a sacred art, in that it also tries to depict, through a [metaconscious] perspective, the essence of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind. Meta meaning, a [[holistic]] view of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind, who sees reality as a whole rather than from a subjective personalized intellectually fragmented point of view. Metarealism is the materialization in pictorial form of the reality of other dimensions and their direct effect, and relation upon us. Metarealism tries to depict the relations between those dimensions of reality and how we psychologically interpret them through our sub mental symbolism. As a narrative style, metarealism does not have a clearly defined lyrical hero and focuses instead on the so-called sum of perceptions, which is "the geometrical space constituted by points of view.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Metarealism in visual art==

According to Bernard De Montréal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.psychologie-alternative.com/Bernard%20de%20Montreal.htm |title=Bernard de Montreal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114114543/http://www.psychologie-alternative.com/Bernard%20de%20Montreal.htm |archive-date=2017-01-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; most contemporary visual arts are involutionary art that expresses the dissimulated frustrations and struggle of the unconscious self in her search for real identity through the [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]], sub mental symbolism of the art form an [[avocation]] of the soul that has little in common with the interdimensional identity of the self.

Conscious or mental art "metarealism" when created by an metaconscious artist is inspired from the higher self, and is a channel for the dictation of the conscious science of art, instead of being simply a lower form of self-expression, a cultural artefact of relative value.

The mental artist has little need for unconscious expression and directs her creative "expiration" toward the exploration of higher consciousness through her art, rather than simply entertaining a fictitious role. Art in its astral form belongs to our kind of civilization. We still need its contention that there is more to reality than appears at first sight. Art in its higher form is therefore created by a totally new human being.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8159">This article discusses the term "'''New Cybernetics'''" as used by [[Gordon Pask]]. He explained it as the meaningful transfer of information between [[Coherent sampling|coherence]]s in all media in terms of attractions and repulsions between clockwise and anti-clockwise spins.&lt;ref&gt;Pask 1993, Pask 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This is a possibly defining paradigm of the new cybernetics or [[second-order cybernetics]].

== Outline ==
Unfoldment of [[Coherence_(physics)|coherences]] of recursively packed concepts by the repulsive "carapace" forces of like concepts and coalescence by the attraction of unlike concepts is a further feature. There is both a [[psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] and [[Panpsychism|panpsychic]] element to Pask's approach. Whilst he was most certainly a [[Second-order cybernetics|second order cybernetician]] this he achieved simply by placing co-ordinates on a participant rather than claiming non-participant [[observation|observer]] status. Beer, similarly, regarded his [[Viable System Model]] as a model of the observer. Pask was liberal in his approach (he eschewed "flag waving" claims) he advocated students and practitioners use his tools if they found them applicable. In his introduction to Graham Barnes' 1994 collection of essays on [[psychotherapy]] and [[second-order cybernetics]] "Justice, Love and Wisdom" with these words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I may claim some fundamental expertise both in the "old" and the congruent but significantly advanced "new" cybernetics. It is on the "new", rather than the "old" (of [[black box]]es and input/output relations), that Graham Barnes explicates this illuminating, relevantly informative, insightful and highly innovative book.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Barnes regarded himself as a participant therapist. At the time Pask had completed work on his first draft of "[[Gordon Pask#Interactions of Actors Theory|Interactions of Actors]] (IA) Theory and Some Applications" and was working on his last paper "[[Heinz von Foerster]]'s [[Self organization#Self-organization in cybernetics|Self-Organization]], the Progenitor of Conversation and Interaction Theories". Here he introduced [[spin (physics)|spin-spin]] forces as the agents of [[Self-organization]], [[Learning]] and [[Evolution]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;The old cybernetics has been elaborated ''ad infinitum''.

The new cybernetics (some call it [[second-order cybernetics]] in contrast to the first order of classical [[black box]]es and [[negative feedback]]) is burgeoning well beyond the bounds of respectability which were imposed by the establishment. If interaction, albeit interrupted by a phone call or a business trip, is unfettered in intellectual flow, I call it a conversation which leads to an exchange of concepts, not necessarily of the topic, but of the participants. It may or may not be about whatever is the alleged topic of conversation. Later we consider interaction of a broader kind, the interaction of actors. Conversations are events which have a beginning and have an end and may be subdivided into kinematic portions, in contrast to interactions of actors which cannot.&lt;ref&gt;Pask 1996:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For some years in talks with his research students he had remarked on the "hard carapace" (see [[Gordon Pask]] for diagram) as a stability criterion for concepts (persisting countably infinite packed recursive spins that produce relations  ''in '''any''' medium'') and that there were "[[No Doppelgangers]]". These were perplexing themes and it was some time before the small differences between coherences were seen as productive of differentiation&lt;ref&gt;Green 2001&lt;/ref&gt; in evolution and learning. These small differences or incommensurabilities are ultimately aggregative as Pask's last theorem showed "Like concepts repel, unlike concept attract". The durations for small differences to assert could be very long and it is important to realize that in the strictly field concurrent world of IA theory a communicated concept has opposite spin to its source concept.&lt;ref&gt;Pask 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

A dispersive (e.g. [[Fourier transform|Fourier]]) transform might be applied to disclose the spin spectra in a particular context from a particular perspective. For many years he discussed these distinctions in his [[Gordon Pask#Conversation Theory .28CT.29|Conversation Theory]] by insisting that his p-individuals could exist in a single m-individual, where communication was [[Synchronous communication|synchronous]] or in many m-individuals where p-individuals were coherent collections of concepts and m-individuals where the media supporting these states, communicated [[asynchronous communication|asynchronously]] or via a [[Petri net]] token protocol.

"They will come to know" said Pask of his new approach. He regarded IA as a process theory and his Actors were eternal, supporting the production of all bounded products (e.g. conversations, descriptions or describable [[Coherent sampling|coherence]]s) with their forces. His position with regard to the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] and Bohr [[Complementarity (physics)|Complementarity]] was captured in Pask's Complementarity Principle: "Products are produced by processes and all processes produce products". In the last paper&lt;ref name="Pask 1996"&gt;Pask 1996&lt;/ref&gt; remarked that there was a particle aspect to a conversation the recompilation of which by a recipient was the meaning or affective emotion.

On the "[[Many-worlds]]" (interpretation of quantum mechanics) he says "Theories of many universes, one at least for each participant- one to participant A and one to participant B- are bridged by an analogy. As before this is ''the [[truth value]] of any interaction: the metaphor for which is culture itself''".&lt;ref name="Pask 1996"/&gt;

In some respects Pask's new Cybernetics is an evolution of [[Freud]] and [[Jung]]'s ideas of [[psychodynamics]] and the doctrines of [[panpsychism]]. Amongst the ancients [[Thales#Beliefs in divinity|Thales]]' speculations can be seen in Pask's work. Here, rather than the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics|Boltzmann distribution]] as fundamental to the model, we have the possible coalitions of concepts in all media&lt;ref&gt;von Foerster 2001&lt;/ref&gt; which produces a distribution of [[Stirling number]]s of the second kind and their forces of interaction.

Pask was interested in the [[Gordon Pask#Interactions of Actors Theory .28IA.29|prismatic tensegrity]] as a means of analyzing these concurrent forces.

{{Old Norse topics}}

'''Old Norse''' was a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]] that was spoken by inhabitants of [[Scandinavia]] and inhabitants of their [[Viking expansion|overseas settlements]] from about the 9th to the 13th century.

The [[Proto-Norse language]] developed into Old Norse by the 8th century, and Old Norse began to develop into the modern North Germanic languages in the mid- to late 14th century, ending the language phase known as Old Norse. These dates, however, are not absolute, since written Old Norse is found well into the 15th century.{{sfn|Torp|Vikør|1993}}

Old Norse was divided into three [[dialect]]s: [[Old West Norse]], [[Old East Norse]], and [[Old Gutnish]]. Old West and East Norse formed a [[dialect continuum]], with no clear geographical boundary between them. For example, Old East Norse traits were found in eastern [[Norway]], although Old Norwegian is classified as Old West Norse, and Old West Norse traits were found in western [[Sweden]]. Most speakers spoke Old East Norse in what is present day [[Denmark]] and Sweden. Old Gutnish, the more obscure dialectal branch, is sometimes included in the Old East Norse dialect due to geographical associations. It developed its own unique features and shared in changes to both other branches.

The 12th-century Icelandic ''[[Gray Goose Laws]]'' state that Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders, and Danes spoke the same language, ''dǫnsk tunga'' ("Danish tongue"; speakers of Old East Norse would have said ''dansk tunga''). Another term, used especially commonly with reference to West Norse, was ''norrœnt mál'' or ''norrǿnt mál'' ("Nordic/Northern speech"). Today Old Norse has developed into the modern North Germanic languages [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], of which Norwegian, Danish and Swedish retain considerable [[mutual intelligibility]].

== Geographical distribution ==
{{Old Norse language map}}
[[Old Norse#Old Icelandic|Old Icelandic]] was very close to [[Old Norwegian]], and together they formed the Old West Norse dialect, which was also spoken in settlements in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]] and northwest England, and in Norse settlements in [[Normandy]].&lt;ref name="JohnsonEcyc"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|1899|loc= "Scandinavian Languages", pp.336–338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Old East Norse dialect was spoken in Denmark, Sweden, settlements in [[Kievan Rus']],&lt;ref name="Nationalencyklopedin"&gt;{{citation| title = Nordiska språk| at = § ''Historia'', §§ ''Omkring 800–1100''| work = [[Nationalencyklopedin]]| language = Swedish | year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; eastern England, and Danish settlements in [[Normandy]]. The [[Old Gutnish]] dialect was spoken in [[Gotland]] and in various settlements in the East. In the 11th century, Old Norse was the most widely spoken European language, ranging from [[Vinland]] in the West to the [[Volga River]] in the East. In [[Kievan Rus']], it survived the longest in [[Veliky Novgorod]], probably lasting into the [[13th century]] there.&lt;ref name="Nationalencyklopedin" /&gt; The age of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland]] is strongly contested, but at latest by the time of the [[Second Swedish Crusade]] in the 13th century, Swedish settlement had spread the language into the region.

== Modern descendants ==
{{Main article|North Germanic languages}}
The modern descendants of the Old West Norse dialect are the West Scandinavian languages of [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and the extinct [[Norn language]] of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]; the descendants of the Old East Norse dialect are the East Scandinavian languages of [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Norwegian is descended from Old West Norse, but over the centuries it has been heavily influenced by East Norse, particularly during the [[Denmark–Norway]] union.

Among these, Icelandic and the closely related Faroese have changed the least from Old Norse in the last thousand years, although with Danish rule of the Faroe Islands, Faroese has also been influenced by Danish. Old Norse also had an influence on [[English language|English]] dialects and [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]], which contain many Old Norse [[loanword]]s. It also influenced the development of the [[Norman language]], and through it and to a smaller extent, that of modern [[French language|French]].

Of the modern languages, Icelandic is the closest to Old Norse. Written modern Icelandic derives from the Old Norse [[phoneme|phonemic]] writing system. Contemporary Icelandic-speakers can read Old Norse, which varies slightly in spelling as well as semantics and word order. However, pronunciation, particularly of the vowel phonemes, has changed at least as much as in the other North Germanic languages.

Faroese retains many similarities but is influenced by Danish, Norwegian, and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] ([[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]] and/or [[Irish language|Irish]]).{{sfn|van der Auwera|König|1994|loc = "Faroese" (Barnes &amp; Weyhe), p. 217}} Although Swedish, Danish and the Norwegian languages have diverged the most, they still retain [[mutual intelligibility]].{{sfn|Moberg|Gooskens|Nerbonne|Vaillette|2007}} Speakers of modern Swedish, Norwegian and Danish can mostly understand each other without studying their neighboring languages, particularly if speaking slowly. The languages are also sufficiently similar in writing that they can mostly be understood across borders. This could be because these languages have been mutually affected by each other, as well as having a similar development influenced by [[Middle Low German]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', {{harvnb|Harbert|2007|pp=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other influenced languages===
Various other languages, which are not closely related, have been heavily influenced by Norse, particularly the [[Norman language]]. [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] also have a number of Norse loanwords; the words ''Rus'' and ''Russia'', according to one theory, may be named after the [[Rus' people]], a Norse tribe; ''see [[Rus (name)]]'', probably from present-day east-central Sweden. The current Finnish and Estonian words for Sweden are ''Ruotsi'' and ''Rootsi'', respectively. 

A number of loanwords have been introduced into the  [[Irish language]] – many but not all are associated with fishing and sailing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Old Norse loanwords in modern Irish | first = Robert| last = Farren | type = thesis | year = 2014 | publisher = Lund University | url  =http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=4861711&amp;fileOId=4861798 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Norse loanwords in Old and Middle Irish | type=  thesis | first = Aukje | last = Borkent |  publisher = Utrecht University | url  =https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/296646 | year = 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =http://irisharchaeology.ie/2013/11/some-irish-words-with-norse-origins/| title = Some Irish words with Norse Origins | date = 21 Nov 2013 | work = irisharchaeology.ie }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = | title = The influence of Scandinavian on Irish | editor-first =Bo | editor-last= Almqvist | editorlink= Bo Almqvist | editor-first2= David | editor-last2= Greene | work = Proceedings of the Seventh Viking Congress | publisher = Dundalgan Press, Dundalk | pages =75–82 | last = Greene | first = D. | year = 1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar influence is found in [[Scots Gaelic]], with over one hundred loanwords estimated to be in the language, many of which, but not all, are related to fishing and sailing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Lexical imposition: Old Norse vocabulary in Scottish Gaelic | first = Thomas W.

== Phonology ==
{{IPA notice|section}}

=== Vowels ===
The vowel phonemes mostly come in pairs of long and short. The [[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standardized orthography]] marks the long vowels with an acute accent. In medieval manuscripts, it is often unmarked but sometimes marked with an accent or through [[gemination]]. All phonemes have, more or less, the expected phonetic realization.

Old Norse has had nasalized versions of all nine vowel places.&lt;ref name="CleasbyA" group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc= p.1, "A"}}&lt;/ref&gt; These occurred as allophones of the vowels before nasal consonants and in places where a nasal had followed it in an older form of the word, before it was absorbed into a neighboring sound. If the nasal was absorbed by a stressed vowel, it would also lengthen the vowel. These nasalizations also occurred in the other Germanic languages, but were not retained long. They were noted in the [[First Grammatical Treatise]], and otherwise might have remained unknown. The First Grammarian marked these with a dot above the letter.&lt;ref name="CleasbyA" group="cv" /&gt; This notation did not catch on, and would soon be obsolete. Nasal and oral vowels probably merged around the 11th century in most of Old East Norse.{{sfn|Bandle|2005|loc = Ch. XVII §202 "The typological development of the Nordic languages I: Phonology" (H. Sandøy) :  ''Old East Nordic'', p.1856, 1859}} However, the distinction still holds in [[Dalecarlian dialects]].{{sfn|Bandle|2005|loc = Ch. XVII §202 "The typological development of the Nordic languages I: Phonology" (H. Sandøy) : ''Old West Nordic'', p.1859}} The dots in the following vowel table separate the oral from [[Nasal vowel|nasal]] phonemes.

Note: The open or open-mid vowels may be transcribed differently:
* {{IPA|/æ/}} = {{IPA|/ɛ/}}
* {{IPA|/ɒ/}} = {{IPA|/ɔ/}}
* {{IPA|/ɑ/}} = {{IPA|/a/}}

Sometime around the 13th century, {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (spelled ǫ) merged with {{IPA|/ø/}} or {{IPA|/o/}} in all dialects except [[#Old Danish|Old Danish]]. In Icelandic, all {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (ǫ) merged with {{IPA|/ø/}}. This can be determined by their distinction within the 12th-century [[First Grammatical Treatise]] but not within the early 13th-century [[Prose Edda]]. The nasal vowels, also noted in the First Grammatical Treatise, are assumed to have been lost in most dialects by this time (but notably they are retained in [[Elfdalian]]). See [[#Old Icelandic|Old Icelandic]] for the mergers of {{IPA|/øː/}} (spelled œ) with {{IPA|/ɛː/}} (spelled æ) and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} (spelled ę) with {{IPA|/e/}} (e).

=== Consonants ===
Old Norse has six plosive phonemes, {{IPA|/p/}} being rare word-initially and {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/b/}} pronounced as voiced fricative [[allophone]]s between vowels except in compound words (e.g. veðrabati), already in the [[Proto-Germanic language]] (e.g. ''*b'' {{IPA|*[β]}} &gt; [v] between vowels). The {{IPA|/ɡ/}} phoneme was pronounced as {{IPA|[ɡ]}} after an ''n'' or another ''g'' and as {{IPA|[k]}} before {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/t/}}. Some accounts have it a voiced velar fricative {{IPA|[ɣ]}} in all cases, and others have that realisation only in the middle of words and between vowels (with it otherwise being realised {{IPA|[ɡ]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Orrin W. |last = Robinson | title = Old English and Its Closest Relatives| page =83| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;{{harvnb|Sweet|1895|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=Scope of source in regards to /k/ before /s/, /t/; In general or in OIC? Date?|date=March 2010}} The Old East Norse /ʀ/ was an [[apical consonant]], with its precise position is unknown; it is reconstructed as a palatal [[sibilant]]{{sfn|Bandle|2005|loc = Ch. XVII §202 "The typological development of the Nordic languages I: Phonology" (H. Sandøy) : ''Common Nordic'', p.1855}}. It descended from Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/z/}} and eventually developed into {{IPA|/r/}}, as had already occurred in Old West Norse.

The consonant digraphs ''hl'', ''hr'', ''hn'' occurred word-initially. It is unclear whether they were sequences of two consonants (with the first element realised as {{IPA|/h/}} or perhaps {{IPA|/x/}}) or as single voiceless sonorants {{IPA|/l̥/}}, {{IPA|/r̥/}} and {{IPA|/n̥/}} respectively. In Old Norwegian, Old Danish and later Old Swedish, the groups ''hl'', ''hr'', ''hn'' were reduced to plain ''l'', ''r'', ''n'', which suggests that they had most likely already been pronounced as voiceless sonorants by Old Norse times.

The pronunciation of ''hv'' is unclear, but it may have been {{IPA|/xʷ/}} (the Proto-Germanic pronunciation), {{IPA|/hʷ/}} or {{IPA|/ʍ/}}. Unlike the three other digrapghs, it was retained much longer in all dialects. Without ever developing into a voiceless sonorant in Icelandic, it instead underwent [[fortition]] to a plosive {{IPA|/kv/}}, which suggests that instead of being a voiceless sonorant, it retained a stronger frication.

=== Orthography ===
{{Main article|Old Norse orthography}}
Unlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the [[Elder Futhark]], runic Old Norse was originally written with the [[Younger Futhark]], which only had 16 letters. Because of the limited number of runes, several runes were used for different sounds, and the distinction between long and short vowels wasn't retained in writing. [[Medieval runes]] came into use some time later.

As for the [[Latin alphabet]], there was no standardized orthography in use in the Middle Ages. A modified version of the letter [[wynn]] called [[vend (letter)|vend]] was used briefly for the sounds {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, and {{IPA|/w/}}. Long vowels were sometimes marked with acutes, but also sometimes left unmarked or geminated. The [[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standardized Old Norse spelling]] was created in the 19th century, and is for the most part phonemic. The most notable deviation is that the non-phonemic difference between the [[voiced dental fricative|voiced]] and the [[voiceless dental fricative]] is marked—the oldest texts as well as [[runic inscriptions]] use [[thorn (letter)|''þ'']] exclusively. Long vowels are denoted with [[acute accent|acutes]]. Most other letters are written with the same glyph as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phoneme, except as shown in the table below.

=== Accent ===
{{See also|Stød|Norwegian phonology#Accent|Swedish phonology#Stress and pitch|l1=Danish stød|l2=Norwegian tonal stress|l3=Swedish tonal stress}}
{{Expand section|Dating, etc.|date=April 2010}}

Primary [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] in Old Norse falls on the [[word stem]], so that ''hyrjar'' would be pronounced {{IPA|/ˈhyr.jar/}}. In compound words, secondary stress falls on the second stem (e.g. ''[[wikt:lærisveinn#Old Norse|lærisveinn]]'', {{IPA|/ˈlɛːɾ.iˌswɛinː/}}).&lt;ref name="ProseReader"&gt;{{harvnb|Vigfússon|Powell|1879|loc=  Ch. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonological processes ==

=== Ablaut ===
'''[[Indo-European ablaut|Ablaut]]''' patterns are groups of vowels which are swapped, or '''ablauted,''' in the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] of a word. [[Old Norse morphology#Strong verbs|Strong verbs]] ablaut the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]]'s nucleus to derive the past forms of the verb. This parallels English conjugation, where, e.g., the nucleus of ''sing'' becomes ''sang'' in the past tense and ''sung'' in the past participle. Some verbs are derived by ablaut, as the [[Old Norse morphology#Present-preterite verbs|present-in-past verbs]] do by consequence of being derived from the past tense forms of strong verbs.

=== Umlaut ===
{{See also|Germanic umlaut|Old Norse morphology#Before Old Norse|l2=Old Norse morphophonology}}

'''Umlaut''' or '''mutation''' is an [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilatory]] process acting on vowels preceding a vowel or semivowel of a different [[vowel backness]]. In the case of '''i-umlaut''' and '''ʀ-umlaut''', this entails a fronting of back vowels, with retention of lip rounding. In the case of '''u-umlaut''', this entails [[labialization]] of unrounded vowels. Umlaut is phonemic and in many situations grammatically significant as a side effect of losing the [[Proto-Germanic language#Morphology|Proto-Germanic morphological suffixes]] whose vowels created the umlaut [[allophones]].

Some {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/yː/}}, {{IPA|/ø/}}, {{IPA|/øː/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/ɛː/}}, {{IPA|/øy/}},&lt;ref name="FromOldNordic" /&gt; and all {{IPA|/ɛi/}} were obtained by [[i-mutation|i-umlaut]] from {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/uː/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/oː/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/aː/}}, {{IPA|/au/}}, and {{IPA|/ai/}} respectively. Others were formed via ʀ-umlaut from {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/uː/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/aː/}}, and {{IPA|/au/}}.&lt;ref name="JohnsonEcyc" /&gt;

Some {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/yː/}}, {{IPA|/ø/}}, {{IPA|/øː/}}, and all {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, {{IPA|/ɔː/}} were obtained by u-umlaut from {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/eː/}}, and {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/aː/}} respectively. See [[#Old Icelandic|Old Icelandic]] for information on {{IPA|/ɔː/}}.

{{IPA|/œ/}} was obtained through a simultaneous u- and i-umlaut of {{IPA|/a/}}. It appears in words like ''[[wikt:gera|gøra]]'' (''gjǫra'', ''geyra''), from Proto-Germanic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/garwijanan|*garwijaną]]'', and commonly in verbs with a velar consonant before the suffix like ''[[wikt:søkkva|søkkva]]'' &lt; ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/sankwijanan|*sankwijaną]]''.&lt;ref name="CleasbyOE" group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc = pp.&amp;nbsp;761–2 (Introduction to Letter Ö (Ø))}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OEN often preserves the original value of the vowel directly preceding runic ''ʀ'' while OWN receives ʀ-umlaut. Compare runic OEN ''glaʀ, haʀi, hrauʀ'' with OWN ''gler, heri'' (later ''héri''), ''hrøyrr/hreyrr'' ("glass", "hare", "pile of rocks").

==== U-umlaut ====
U-umlaut is more common in Old West Norse in both phonemic and allophonic positions, while it only occurs sparsely in post-runic Old East Norse and even in runic Old East Norse. Compare West Old Norse ''[[wikt:faðir#Old Norse|fǫður]]'' (accusative of ''faðir'', 'father'), ''[[wikt:vǫrðr#Old Norse|vǫrðr]]'' (guardian/caretaker), ''[[wikt:ǫrn#Old Norse|ǫrn]]'' (eagle), ''[[wikt:jǫrð#Old Norse|jǫrð]]'' ('earth', Modern Icelandic: ''[[wikt:jörð#Icelandic|jörð]]''), ''[[wikt:mjǫlk#Old Norse|mjǫlk]]'' ('milk', Modern Icelandic: ''[[wikt:mjólk#Icelandic|mjólk]]'') with Old Swedish ''faður'', ''varðer'', ''örn'', ''jorð'' and Modern Swedish ''örn'', ''[[wikt:jord|jord]]'', ''[[wikt:mjölk|mjölk]]'' with the latter two demonstrating the u-umlaut found in Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Benediktsson | first1 = H. | title = Some Aspects of Nordic Umlaut and Breaking | journal = Language | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 409–31 | doi = 10.2307/411124 | year = 1963 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 411124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Iversen&gt;{{harvnb|Iversen|1961|p=24-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is still a major difference between Swedish and Faroese and Icelandic today. Plurals of neuters do not have u-umlaut at all in Swedish, but in Faroese and Icelandic they do, for example the Faroese and Icelandic plurals of the word ''[[wikt:land|land]]'', ''[[wikt:land#Faroese|lond]]'' and ''[[wikt:land#Icelandic|lönd]]'' respectively, in contrast to the Swedish plural ''[[wikt:land#Swedish|land]]'' and numerous other examples. That also applies to almost all feminine nouns, for example the largest feminine noun group, the [[o-stem]] nouns (except the Swedish noun ''jord'' mentioned above), and even [[Thematic stem|i-stem]] nouns and [[Proto-Indo-European root#Word formation|root nouns]], such as Old West Norse ''mǫrk'' (''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/IcelOnline/IcelOnline.TEId-idx?type=entry&amp;eid=MO3RK-1&amp;q1=mörk mörk]'' in Icelandic) in comparison with Modern and Old Swedish ''[[wikt:mark#Swedish|mark]]''.&lt;ref name=Iversen /&gt;

=== Breaking ===
{{See also|Vowel breaking}}

'''Vowel breaking''', or '''fracture''', caused a front vowel to be split into a semivowel-vowel sequence before a back vowel in the following syllable.&lt;ref name="JohnsonEcyc" /&gt; While West Norse only broke ''e'', East Norse also broke ''i''. The change was blocked by a ''v'', ''l'', or ''r'' preceding the potentially-broken vowel.&lt;ref name="JohnsonEcyc" /&gt;{{sfn|Bandle|2005|loc = Ch. XVII §202 "The typological development of the Nordic languages I: Phonology" (H. Sandøy) :  ''Proto-Nordic'', p.1853}}

Some {{IPA|/ja/}} or {{IPA|/jɔ/}} and {{IPA|/jaː/}} or {{IPA|/jɔː/}} result from breaking of {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}} respectively.&lt;ref name="CleasbyPhonRules" group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc = pp.&amp;nbsp;xxix–xxx "Formation of Words" : ''Vowel Changes'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assimilation or elision of inflectional ''ʀ'' ===
When a noun, pronoun, adjective, or verb has a long vowel or diphthong in the accented syllable and its stem ends in a single ''l'', ''n'', or ''s'', the ''r'' (or the elder ''r''- or ''z''-variant ''[[Yr rune (Younger Futhark)|ʀ]]'') in an ending is assimilated.&lt;ref name="CleasbyTableN" group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc= p.&amp;nbsp;xvi "Strong Nouns" – ''Masculine'' – Remarks on the 1st Strong Masculine Declension, 3.a}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the accented vowel is short, the ending is dropped.

The nominative of the strong masculine declension and some i-stem feminine nouns uses one such -r (ʀ). ''Óðin''-''r'' (''Óðin''-''ʀ'') becomes ''Óðinn'' instead of ''*Óðinr'' (''*Óðinʀ''). 

The verb ''blása'' 'to blow', has third person present tense '''''blæss''''' for "[he] blows" rather than ''*blæsr'' (''*blæsʀ'').{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc = [http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/olessons/lesson5.php Lesson 5]}} Similarly, the verb ''skína'' 'to shine' had present tense third person '''''skínn''''' (rather than ''*skínr'', ''*skínʀ''); while ''kala'' 'to cool down' had present tense third person '''''kell''''' (rather than ''*kelr'', ''*kelʀ'').

The rule is not absolute, with certain counter-examples such as ''vinr'', which has the synonym ''vin'', yet retains the unabsorbed version, and ''jǫtunn'', where assimilation takes place even though the root vowel, ''ǫ'', is short.

The clusters */Clʀ, Csʀ, Cnʀ, Crʀ/ cannot yield */Clː, Csː, Cnː, Crː/ respectively, instead /Cl, Cs, Cn, Cr/.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Noreen |first=Adolf |title=Altnordische Grammatik I: Altisländische und altnorwegische Grammatik  |url=http://www.arnastofnun.is/solofile/1016380 |publisher= |pages=200–202; 207 (§ 277; § 283)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of this shortening can result in the lack of distinction between some forms of the noun. In the case of ''vetr'', the nominative and accusative singular and plural forms are identical. The nominative singular and nominative and accusative plural would otherwise have been OWN ''*vetrr'', OEN ''*vintrʀ''. These forms are impossible because the cluster */Crʀ/ cannot be realized as /Crː/, nor as */Crʀ/, nor as */Cʀː/. The same shortening as in ''vetr'' also occurs in '''''lax''''' = ''laks'' (as opposed to *''lakss'', *''laksʀ''), '''''botn''''' (as opposed to *''botnn'', ''*botnʀ''), and '''''jarl''''' (as opposed to *''jarll'', *''jarlʀ'').

Furthermore, wherever the cluster */rʀ/ is expected to exist, such as in the male names ''Ragnarr'', ''Steinarr'' (supposedly ''*Ragnarʀ'', ''*Steinarʀ''), the result is apparently always /rː/ rather than */rʀ/ or */ʀː/. This is observable in the Runic corpus

== Phonotactics ==

=== Blocking of ii, uu ===
''I/j'' adjacent to ''i'', ''e'', their u-umlauts, and ''æ'' was not possible, nor ''u/v'' adjacent to ''u'', ''o'', their i-umlauts, and ''ǫ''.&lt;ref name="JohnsonEcyc" /&gt; At the beginning of words, this manifested as a dropping of the initial ''j'' or ''v''. Compare ON ''orð, úlfr, ár'' with English ''word, wolf, year''. In inflections, this manifested as the dropping of the inflectional vowels. Thus, ''klæði'' + &lt;small&gt;dat&lt;/small&gt; ''-i'' remains ''klæði'', and ''sjáum'' in Icelandic progressed to ''sjǫ́um'' &gt; ''sjǫ́m'' &gt; ''sjám''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = A. G.|last =  Noreen  | authorlink = Adolf Noreen | title =  Abriss Der Altnordischen (Altislndischen) Grammatik | language = German | page = 12| url =https://archive.org/details/altnordischegra00unkngoog }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''jj'' and ''ww'' of Proto-Germanic became ''ggj'' and ''ggv'' respectively in Old Norse, a change known as [[Holtzmann's law]].&lt;ref name="JohnsonEcyc" /&gt;

=== Epenthesis ===
An [[epenthetic]] vowel became popular by 1200 in Old Danish, 1250 in Old Swedish and Norwegian, and 1300 in Old Icelandic.&lt;ref name="TheNordicLanguages"&gt;{{harvnb|Bandle|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unstressed vowel was used which varied by dialect. Old Norwegian exhibited all three: /u/ was used in West Norwegian south of [[Bergen]], as in ''aftur'', ''aftor'' (older ''[[wikt:aptr|aptr]]''); North of Bergen, /i/ appeared in ''aftir'', ''after''; and East Norwegian used /a/, ''after'', ''aftær''.&lt;ref name="FromOldNordic"&gt;{{harvnb|Bandle|2005|loc = Ch.XIII §122  "Phonological developments from Old Nordic to Early Modern Nordic I: West Scandinavian." (M. Schulte). pp.&amp;nbsp;1081–96; Monophthongization: p.1082; /øy/: p. 1082; Reduced vowels: p.&amp;nbsp;1085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==
Old Norse was a moderately [[inflection|inflected]] language with high levels of nominal and verbal inflection. Most of the fused [[morpheme]]s are retained in modern Icelandic, especially in regard to noun case declensions, whereas modern Norwegian in comparison has moved towards more analytical word structures.

=== Gender ===
{{Further information|Grammatical gender}}
Old Norse had three [[grammatical gender]]s – masculine, feminine and neuter. Adjectives or pronouns referring to a noun must [[Agreement (linguistics)|mirror the gender of that noun]], so that one says, "heill maðr!" but, "heilt barn!" As in other languages, the grammatical gender of an impersonal noun is generally unrelated to an expected natural gender of that noun. While indeed ''karl'', "man" is masculine, ''kona'', "woman", is feminine, and ''hús'', house, is neuter, so also are ''hrafn'' and ''kráka'', for "raven" and "crow", masculine and feminine respectively, even in reference to a female raven or a male crow.

All neuter words have identical nominative and accusative forms,{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc = [http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/grammar/neutern.php Neuter nouns]}} and all feminine words have identical nominative and accusative plurals.{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc =  [http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/grammar/femininen.php Feminine nouns]}}

The gender of some words' plurals does not agree with that of their singulars, such as ''lim'' and ''mund''.&lt;ref group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon |1874|loc= p.&amp;nbsp;389 col.1, "LIM"; p.&amp;nbsp;437, col.1 "MUND"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some words, such as ''hungr'', have multiple genders, evidenced by their [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] being declined in different genders within a given sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Menota|2.0|loc= Ch. 8 §3.2.1 "Gender2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Zoëga|1910|loc = H: ''hungr''}}

==== Hierarchy ====
Old Norse inherited the Proto-Germanic feature of having neuter as the default gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Early England and the Great Gender Shift: Old English and Old Norse Straddling the Horns of the Default Dilemma| last =  Rice | first =  Steinmetz }}{{pageneeded|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that when the gender of a noun is unknown, adjectives and pronouns referencing it use the neuter gender forms, rather than the masculine or feminine. Thus, if speaking or writing to a general audience, one would say ''velkomit'', "well is it come," rather than ''velkominn'' or ''velkomin'', "well is [he or she] come," as one does not know whether the person hearing it is going to be male or female.

One generally sees adjectives in their neuter form when used [[pronoun|pronominally]] for this reason. For words more commonly used in this way (rather than to describe a noun) one sees their neuter forms more often than their masculine or feminine. Normally the masculine form would be the most beneficial form of an adjective to learn first, given that the majority of nouns are masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Trond |last = Tosterud| doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2004.06.015| title = Gender assignment in Old Norse |journal = Lingua | volume = 116| issue = 9 |date = Sep 2006|pages =  1441–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, however, the most practical form to learn first would be the neuter.

=== Morphology ===
{{Main article|Old Norse morphology}}
Nouns, adjectives and pronouns were [[declension|declined]] in four grammatical cases—[[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]], in singular and plural numbers. Adjectives and pronouns were additionally declined in three grammatical genders. Some pronouns (first and second person) could have [[dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] in addition to singular and plural. The genitive is used [[partitive case|partitively]], and quite often in compounds and [[kenning]]s (e.g.: ''[[Urðarbrunnr]]'', the well of Urðr; ''[[Lokasenna]]'', the gibing of Loki).

There were several classes of nouns within each gender, the following is an example of the "strong" [[inflectional paradigm]]s:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan="3" | The strong masculine noun '''armr''' (English '''arm''')
|-
! Case !! '''Singular''' !! '''Plural'''
|-
| '''Nominative''' || armr || armar
|-
| '''Accusative''' || arm || rowspan="2" | arma
|-
| '''Genitive''' || arms 
|-
| '''Dative''' || armi ||  ǫrmum/armum
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan="3" | The feminine noun '''hǫll''' (OWN), '''hall''' (OEN) (English '''hall''')
|-
! Case !! '''Singular''' !! '''Plural'''
|-
| '''Nominative-Accusative''' || hǫll/hall || hallir/hallar (OEN)
|-
| '''Genitive''' || hallar || halla
|-
| '''Dative''' || hǫllu/hallu || hǫllum/hallum
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan="3" | The neuter noun '''troll''' (English '''troll'''):
|-
! Case !! '''Singular''' !! '''Plural'''
|-
| '''Nominative-Accusative''' || troll || troll
|-
| '''Genitive''' || trolls || trolla
|-
| '''Dative''' || trolli || trollum
|}

In addition to these examples there were the numerous "weak" noun paradigms, which had a much higher degree of syncretism between the different cases in its paradigms, i.e. they had fewer forms than the "strong" nouns.

A definite article was realised as a suffix, that retained an independent declension e.g. '''troll''' (''a troll'') – '''trollit''' (''the troll''), '''hǫll''' ('' a hall'') – '''hǫllin''' (''the hall''), '''armr''' (''an arm'') – '''armrinn''' (''the arm''). This definite article, however, was a separate word, and did not become attached to the noun before later stages of the Old Norse period.

== Texts ==
{{Commons category|Old Norse manuscripts}}
The earliest inscriptions in Old Norse are [[runic alphabet|runic]], from the 8th century. Runes continued to be commonly used until the 15th century and have been recorded to be in use in some form as late as the 19th century in some parts of Sweden. With the conversion to Christianity in the 11th century came the [[Latin alphabet]]. The oldest preserved texts in Old Norse in the Latin alphabet date from the middle of the 12th century. Subsequently, Old Norse became the vehicle of a large and varied body of vernacular literature, unique in medieval Europe. Most of the surviving literature was written in Iceland. Best known are the [[Norse saga]]s, the [[Icelanders' sagas]] and the mythological literature, but there also survives a large body of religious literature, translations into Old Norse of [[courtly romance]]s, classical mythology, and the Old Testament, as well as instructional material, [[First Grammatical Treatise|grammatical treatises]] and a large body of letters and official documents.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' {{harvnb|O'Donoghue|?|p=22–102}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialects ==
Most of the innovations that appeared in Old Norse spread evenly through the Old Norse area. As a result, the dialects were very similar and considered to be the same language, a language that they sometimes called the Danish tongue (''Dǫnsk tunga''), sometimes Norse language (''Norrœnt mál''), as evidenced in the following two quotes from [[Heimskringla]] by [[Snorri Sturluson]]:

{{Verse translation|Móðir Dyggva var Drótt, dóttir Danps konungs, sonar Rígs er fyrstr var konungr kallaðr á danska tungu.
|attr1=[[Heimskringla]], Ynglinga saga § 20. ''Dauði Dyggva''
|Dyggvi's mother was Drott, the daughter of king Danp, Ríg's son, who was the first to be called king in the Danish tongue.
}}

{{Verse translation|...stirt var honum norrœnt mál, ok kylfdi mᴊǫk til orðanna, ok hǫfðu margir menn þat mᴊǫk at spotti.
|attr1=[[Heimskringla]], Saga Sigurðar Jórsalafara, Eysteins ok Ólafs § 35(34). ''Frá veðjan Haralds ok Magnús''
|...the Norse language was hard for him, and he often fumbled for words, which amused people greatly.
}}

However, some changes were geographically limited and so created a dialectal difference between Old West Norse and Old East Norse.

As Proto-Norse evolved into Old Norse, in the 8th century, the effects of the [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] seem to have been very much the same over the whole Old Norse area. But in later dialects of the language a split occurred mainly between west and east as the use of umlauts began to vary. The typical umlauts (for example ''fylla'' from *''fullijan'') were better preserved in the West due to later generalizations in the east where many instances of umlaut were removed (many archaic Eastern texts as well as eastern runic inscriptions however portray the same extent of umlauts as in later Western Old Norse).

All the while, the changes resulting in [[breaking (linguistics)|breaking]] (for example ''hiarta'' from *''hertō'') were more influential in the East probably once again due to generalizations within the inflectional system. This difference was one of the greatest reasons behind the dialectalization that took place in the 9th and 10th centuries, shaping an Old West Norse dialect in Norway and the Atlantic settlements and an Old East Norse dialect in Denmark and Sweden.

Old West Norse and Old Gutnish did not take part in the monophthongization which changed ''æi'' (''ei'') into ''ē'', ''øy'' (''ey'') and ''au'' into ''ø̄'', nor did certain peripheral dialects of Swedish, as seen in modern [[Swedish dialects in Ostrobothnia|Ostrobothnian dialects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://aveneca.com/westeast.html|title=The Old Norse dialect areas| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707195311/http://aveneca.com/westeast.html| archivedate = 7 Jul 2011| year =2009 | work = aveneca.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference was that Old West Norse lost certain combinations of consonants. The combinations -''mp''-, -''nt''-, and -''nk''- were assimilated into -''pp''-, -''tt''- and -''kk''- in Old West Norse, but this phenomenon was limited in Old East Norse.

Here is a comparison between the two dialects as well as Old Gutnish. It is a transcription from one of the [[Funbo Runestones]] (U 990) meaning : ''Veðr and Thane and Gunnar raised this stone after Haursi, their father. God help his spirit'':
{{block indent|Veðr ok Þegn ok Gunnarr reistu stein þenna at Haursa, fǫður sinn. Guð hjalpi ǫnd hans. (OWN)}}
{{block indent| Veðr ok Þegn ok Gunnarr ræistu stæin þenna at Haursa, faður sinn. Guð hialpi and hans (OEN)}}
{{block indent| Veðr ok Þegn ok Gunnarr raistu stain þenna at Haursa, faður sinn. Guð hialpi and hans (OG)}}

The OEN original text above is transliterated according to traditional scholarly methods, wherein u-umlaut is not regarded in runic Old East Norse. Modern studies{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} have shown that the positions where it applies are the same as for runic Old West Norse. An alternative and probably more accurate transliteration would therefore render the text in OEN as such:
{{block indent|Veðr ok Þegn ok Gunnarr ræistu stæin þenna at Haursa, fǫður sinn. Guð hialpi ǫnd hans (OEN)}}

Some [[past participle]]s and other words underwent i-umlaut in Old West Norse but not in Old East Norse dialects. Examples of that are Icelandic slegið/sleginn and tekið/tekinn, which in Swedish are [[:wikt:slagit|slagit]]/[[:wikt:slagen|slagen]] and [[:wikt:tagit|tagit]]/[[:wikt:tagen|tagen]]. This can also be seen in the Icelandic and Norwegian words [[:wikt:sterkur|sterkur]] and [[:wikt:sterk|sterk]] ("strong"), which in Swedish is [[:wikt:stark|stark]] as in Old Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://runeberg.org/svetym/0950.html | title = "stark" | page = 862 |work = Svensk etymologisk ordbok [Swedish etymological dictionary]|language = Swedish | year = 1922 | editor-first = Elof| editor-last = Hellquist | editorlink =Elof Hellquist }}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences can also be seen in comparison between Norwegian and Swedish.

=== Old West Norse ===
The combinations -mp-, -nt-, and -nk- mostly merged to -pp-, -tt- and -kk- in Old West Norse at around the 7th century, marking the first distinction between the Eastern and Western dialects.{{sfn|Bandle|2005|loc = Ch. XVII §202 "The typological development of the Nordic languages I: Phonology" (H. Sandøy) : ''Old East Nordic'', pp.&amp;nbsp;1856, 1859}} The following table illustrates this:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"

|-
| to sprint || spretta || sprinta || *sprintan
|-

|}

An early difference between Old West Norse and the other dialects was that Old West Norse had the forms ''bú'' "dwelling", ''kú'' "cow" (accusative) and ''trú'' "faith" whereas Old East Norse had ''bó'', ''kó'' and ''tró''. Old West Norse was also characterized by the preservation of ''u''-umlaut, which meant that for example [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] *''tanþu'' "tooth" was pronounced ''tǫnn'' and not ''tann'' as in post-runic Old East Norse; OWN ''gǫ́s'' and runic OEN ''gǫ́s'', while post-runic OEN ''gás'' "goose".

The earliest body of text appears in [[runic inscriptions]] and in poems composed c. 900 by [[Þjóðólfr of Hvinir]] (although the poems are not preserved in contemporary sources, but only in much later manuscripts). The earliest manuscripts are from the period 1150–1200 and concern both legal, religious and historical matters. During the 12th and 13th centuries, [[Trøndelag]] and [[Western Norway]] were the most important areas of the Norwegian kingdom and they shaped Old West Norse as an archaic language with a rich set of declensions. In the body of text that has come down to us from until c. 1300, Old West Norse had little dialect variation, and [[Old Icelandic]] does not diverge much more than the [[Old Norwegian]] dialects do from each other.

Old Norwegian differentiated early from Old Icelandic by the loss of the consonant ''h'' in initial position before ''l'', ''n'' and ''r'', thus whereas Old Icelandic manuscripts might use the form ''hnefi'' "fist", Old Norwegian manuscripts might use ''nefi''.

From the late 13th century, Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian started to diverge more. After c. 1350, the [[Black Death]] and following social upheavals seem to have accelerated language changes in Norway. From the late 14th century, the language used in Norway is generally referred to as [[Old Norwegian#Middle Norwegian|Middle Norwegian]].

Old West Norse underwent a lengthening of initial vowels at some point, especially in Norwegian, so that OWN ''eta'' became ''éta,'' ONW ''akr'' &gt; ''ákr'', OIC ''ek'' &gt; ''ék''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Further Old Norse Secondary Formations |first=Albert Morey |last=Sturtevant |journal=Language |volume=29 |issue=4 |year=1953  |jstor=409955 |doi=10.2307/409955 | page = 457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Old Icelandic ====
In Iceland, initial {{IPA|/w/}} before {{IPA|/ɾ/}} was lost.&lt;ref group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon |1874|loc = p.&amp;nbsp;481 "R"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare Icelandic ''[[wikt:rangur#Icelandic|rangur]]'' with Norwegian ''vrangr'', OEN ''vrangʀ''. This change is shared with Old Gutnish.&lt;ref name="TheNordicLanguages" /&gt;

A specifically Icelandic sound, the long, u-umlauted A, spelled Ǫ́ and pronounced {{IPA|/ɔː/}}, developed circa the early 11th century.&lt;ref name="CleasbyA" group="cv" /&gt; It was short-lived, being marked in the [[First Grammatical Treatise|Grammatical Treatises]] and remaining until the end of the 12th century.&lt;ref name="CleasbyA" group="cv" /&gt;{{clarify|reason|What did it change to?|date=July 2017}}

{{IPA|/w/}} merged with {{IPA|/v/}} during the 12th century.&lt;ref name="JohnsonEcyc" /&gt; This caused {{IPA|/v/}} to become an independent phoneme from {{IPA|/f/}}, and the written distinction of {{angle bracket|{{IPA|v}}}} for {{IPA|/v/}} from medial and final {{angle bracket|{{IPA|f}}}} to become merely etymological.

Around the 13th century, Œ/Ǿ ({{IPA|/øː/}}) merged to Æ ({{IPA|/ɛː/}}).&lt;ref name="CleasbyAE" group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon |1874|loc = p.&amp;nbsp;757 "Æ"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, pre-13th-century ''grœnn'' 'green' became modern Icelandic ''grænn''. The 12th-century [[Gray Goose Laws]] manuscripts distinguish the vowels, and so the [[Codex Regius]] copy does as well.&lt;ref name="CleasbyAE" group="cv" /&gt; However, the 13th-century Codex Regius copy of the [[Poetic Edda]] probably relied on newer and/or poorer quality sources—demonstrating either difficulty with or total lack of natural distinction, the manuscripts show separation of the two phonemes in some places, but frequently mix up the letters chosen to distinguish them in others.&lt;ref name="CleasbyAE" group="cv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Codex Regius]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 13th century, Ę ({{IPA|/ɛ/}}) merged to E ({{IPA|/e/}}).&lt;ref name="CleasbyE" group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon |1874|loc = pp.&amp;nbsp;113–4 "E"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Old Norwegian ====
{{Further information|Old Norwegian}}
Around the 11th century,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Old Norwegian {{angle bracket|{{IPA|hl}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|hn}}}}, and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|hr}}}} became {{angle bracket|{{IPA|l}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|n}}}}, and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|r}}}}. It is debatable whether the {{angle bracket|{{IPA|hC}}}} sequences represented a consonant cluster, {{IPA|/hC/}}, or a devoicing, {{IPA|/C̥/}}.

Orthographic evidence suggests that, in a confined dialect of Old Norwegian, /ɔ/ may have been unrounded before /u/, so that u-umlaut was reversed where the ''u'' had not been eliminated. e.g. ''ǫll'', ''ǫllum'' &gt; ''ǫll'', ''allum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink = Hans Henrich Hock| last = Hock | first = Hans Henrich | title = Principles of Historical Linguistics | year =  1986 |page = 149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Greenlandic Norse ====
{{Further information|Greenlandic Norse}}
This dialect of Old West Norse was spoken by Icelandic colonies in Greenland. When the colonies died out around the 15th century, the dialect went with it. The phoneme {{IPA|/θ/}}, and some {{IPA|/ð/}} merged to {{IPA|/t/}}, so that Old Icelandic '''Þórðr''' becomes '''Tortr'''.

The following text is from ''Alexanders saga'', an [[Alexander romance]]. The manuscript, [[AM 519 a 4to]], is dated c. 1280. The facsimile demonstrates the [[scribal abbreviation|sigla]] used by scribes to write Old Norse. Many of these were borrowed from Latin. Without familiarity with these abbreviations, the facsimile will be unreadable to many. In addition, reading the manuscript itself requires familiarity with the letterforms of the native script. The abbreviations are expanded in a version with normalized spelling like the [[Old Norse orthography|standard normalization]] system's. Comparing this to the spelling of the same text in Modern Icelandic shows that, while pronunciation has changed greatly, spelling has changed little.

Old East Norse, between 800 and 1100, is called ''Runic Swedish'' in Sweden and ''Runic Danish'' in Denmark, but for geographical not linguistic reasons. Any differences between the two were minute at best during the more ancient stages of this dialect group. Changes had a tendency to occur earlier in the Danish region. Even today many Old Danish changes have still not taken place in modern Swedish. Swedish is therefore the more archaic of the two in both the ancient and the modern languages, sometimes by a profound margin but in general, differences are still minute. The language is called ''runic'' because the body of text appears in [[runes]].

Runic Old East Norse is characteristically archaic in form, especially Swedish (which is still true for modern Swedish compared to Danish). In essence it matches or surpasses the archaicness of post-runic Old West Norse which in its turn is generally more archaic than post-runic Old East Norse. While typically "Eastern" in structure, many later post-runic changes and trademarks of OEN had yet to happen.

The phoneme ''ʀ'', which evolved during the Proto-Norse period from ''z'', was still clearly separated from ''r'' in most positions, even when being geminated, while in OWN it had already merged with ''r''.

Monophthongization of ''æi &gt; ē'' and ''øy, au &gt; ø̄'' started in mid-10th-century Denmark.&lt;ref name="FromOldNordic" /&gt; Compare runic OEN: ''fæigʀ'', ''gæiʀʀ'', ''haugʀ'', ''møydōmʀ'', ''diūʀ''; with Post-runic OEN: ''fēgher'', ''gēr'', ''hø̄gher'', ''mø̄dōmber'', ''diūr''; OWN: ''[[wikt:feigr|feigr]]'', ''[[wikt:geirr|geirr]]'', ''[[wikt:howe|haugr]]'', ''meydómr'', ''dýr''; from PN *faigiaz, *gaizaz, *haugaz, *mawi- + dōmaz (maidendom; virginity), *diuza ((wild) animal).

Feminine o-stems often preserve the plural ending -aʀ while in OWN they more often merge with the feminine i-stems: (runic OEN) ''*sōlaʀ'', ''*hafnaʀ''/''*hamnaʀ'', ''*vāgaʀ'' while OWN ''sólir'', ''hafnir'' and ''vágir'' (modern Swedish ''solar'', ''hamnar'', ''vågar''; suns, havens, scales; Danish has mainly lost the distinction between the two stems with both endings now being rendered as -er or -e alternatively for the o-stems).

Vice versa, masculine i-stems with the root ending in either ''g'' or ''k'' tended to shift the plural ending to that of the ja-stems while OEN kept the original: ''drængiaʀ'', ''*ælgiaʀ'' and ''*bænkiaʀ'' while OWN ''[[wikt:drengr#Old Norse|drengir]]'', ''elgir'' (elks) and ''[[wikt:bekkr#Etymology 1|bekkir]]'' (modern Danish ''[[wikt:dreng|drenge]]'', ''[[wikt:elg|elge]]'', ''[[wikt:bænk|bænke]]'', modern Swedish ''[[wikt:dräng|drängar]]'', ''älgar'', ''bänkar'').

The plural ending of ja-stems were mostly preserved while those of OEN often acquired that of the i-stems: ''*bæðiaʀ'', ''*bækkiaʀ'', ''*væfiaʀ'' while OWN ''beðir'' (beds), ''[[wikt:bekkr#Etymology 2|bekkir]]'', ''[[wikt:vefr#Old Norse|vefir]]'' (modern Swedish ''bäddar'', ''bäckar'', ''vävar'').

==== Old Danish ====
{{Further information|History of Danish}}
Until the early 12th century, Old East Norse was very much a uniform dialect. It was in Denmark that the first innovations appeared that would differentiate Old Danish from Old Swedish ({{harvnb|Bandle|2005|loc = ''Old East Nordic'', pp.&amp;nbsp;1856, 1859}}) as these innovations spread north unevenly (unlike the earlier changes that spread more evenly over the East Norse area) creating a series of [[isogloss]]es going from [[Zealand]] to [[Svealand]].

In Old Danish, {{IPA|/hɾ/}} merged with {{IPA|/ɾ/}} during the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Tarrin | last =  Wills | title = The Anonymous Verse in the Third Grammatical Treatise| url  =https://sro.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/10765/54631 | year = 2006 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 11th to 14th centuries, the unstressed vowels -''a'', -''o'' and -''e'' ([[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standard normalization]] -''a'', -''u'' and -''i'') started to merge into -''ə'', represented with the letter ''e''. This vowel came to be [[epenthesis|epenthetic]], particularly before ''-ʀ'' endings.&lt;ref name="TheNordicLanguages" /&gt; At the same time, the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s ''p'', ''t'' and ''k'' became voiced plosives and even [[fricative consonant]]s. Resulting from these innovations, Danish has ''kage'' (cake), ''tunger'' (tongues) and ''gæster'' (guests) whereas (Standard) Swedish has retained older forms, ''kaka'', ''tungor'' and ''gäster'' (OEN ''kaka'', ''tungur'', ''gæstir'').

Moreover, the Danish [[pitch accent]] shared with Norwegian and Swedish changed into ''[[stød]]'' around this time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==== Old Swedish ====
{{Further information|Old Swedish}}
At the end of the 10th and early 11th century initial ''h-'' before ''l'', ''n'' and ''r'' was still preserved in the middle and northern parts of Sweden, and is sporadically still preserved in some northern dialects as ''g-'', e.g. ''gly'' (lukewarm), from ''hlýʀ''. The [[Dalecarlian dialects]] developed independently from Old Swedish&lt;ref name=Kroonen&gt;{{citation|last1=Kroonen|first1=Guus|title=On the origins of the Elfdalian nasal vowels from the perspective of diachronic dialectology and Germanic etymology|url=http://inss.ku.dk/ansatte/?pure=files/35220983/elfdalian.pdf|work = inss.ku.dk | type = Presentation |accessdate=27 January 2016 |quote = (Slide 26) §7.2 quote: "In many aspects, Elfdalian, takes up a middle position between East and West Nordic. However, it shares some innovations with West Nordic, but none with East Nordic. This invalidates the claim that Elfdalian split off from Old Swedish."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such can be considered separate languages from Swedish.

==== Text example ====
This is an extract from ''[[Västgötalagen]]'', the Westrogothic law. It is the oldest text written as a manuscript found in Sweden and from the 13th century. It is contemporaneous with most of the Icelandic literature. The text marks the beginning of [[Old Swedish]] as a distinct dialect.
{{Verse translation|

If someone slays a Swede or a Smålander, a man from the kingdom, but not a West Geat, he will pay eight örtugar and thirteen marks, but no weregild. [...] If someone slays a Dane or a Norwegian, he will pay nine marks. If someone slays a foreigner, he shall not be banished and have to flee to his clan. If someone slays a foreign priest, he will pay as much as for a fellow countryman. A priest counts as a freeman. If a Southerner is slain or an Englishman, he shall pay four marks to the plaintiff and two marks to the king.

=== Old Gutnish ===
{{Main article|Old Gutnish}}
Due to [[Gotland]]'s early isolation from the mainland, many features of Old Norse did not spread from or to the island, and Old Gutnish developed as an entirely separate branch from Old East and West Norse. For example, the diphthong ''ai'' in ''aigu'', ''þair'' and ''waita'' was not retroactively umlauted to ''ei'' as in e.g. Old Icelandic ''eigu'', ''þeir'' and ''veita''. Breaking was especially active in Old Gutnish, leading to forms such as ''bjera'' and ''bjauþa'', mainland ''bera'' and ''bjóða''. Dropping of /w/ in initial /wɾ/ is shared only with Old Icelandic.&lt;ref name="TheNordicLanguages" /&gt;

==== Text example ====
The [[Gutasaga]] is the longest text surviving from [[Old Gutnish]]. It was written in the 13th century and dealt with the early history of the Gotlanders. This part relates to the agreement that the Gotlanders had with the Swedish king sometime before the 9th century:

{{Verse translation|
So gingu gutar sielfs wiliandi vndir suia kunung þy at þair mattin frir Oc frelsir sykia suiariki j huerium staþ. vtan tull oc allar utgiftir. So aigu oc suiar sykia gutland firir vtan cornband ellar annur forbuþ. hegnan oc hielp sculdi kunungur gutum at waita. En þair wiþr þorftin. oc kallaþin. sendimen al oc kunungr oc ierl samulaiþ a gutnal þing senda. Oc latta þar taka scatt sinn. þair sendibuþar aighu friþ lysa gutum alla steþi til sykia yfir haf sum upsala kunungi til hoyrir. Oc so þair sum þan wegin aigu hinget sykia.
|
So, by their own will, the Gotlanders became the subjects of the Swedish king, so that they could travel freely and without risk to any location in the Swedish kingdom without toll and other fees. Likewise, the Swedes had the right to go to Gotland without corn restrictions or other prohibitions. The king was to provide protection and help, when they needed it and asked for it. The king and the jarl shall send emissaries to the Gutnish ''thing'' to receive the taxes. These emissaries shall declare free passage for the Gotlanders to all locations in the sea of the king at Uppsala and likewise for everyone who wanted to travel to Gotland.

{{See also|History of English#Scandinavian influence|List of English words of Old Norse origin}}
[[Old English]] and Old Norse were related languages. It is therefore not surprising that many words in Old Norse look familiar to English speakers (e.g., ''armr'' (arm), ''fótr'' (foot), ''land'' (land), ''fullr'' (full), ''hanga'' (to hang), ''standa'' (to stand)). This is because both [[English language|English]] and Old Norse stem from a [[Proto-Germanic]] mother language. In addition, numerous common, everyday Old Norse words were adopted into the Old English language during the Viking age. A few examples of Old Norse [[loanword]]s in modern English are (English/Viking age Old East Norse), in some cases even displacing their Old English cognates:{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* '''Nouns''' – ''anger'' (angr), ''bag'' (baggi), ''bait'' (bæit, bæita, bæiti), ''band'' (band), ''bark'' (bǫrkʀ, stem bark-), ''birth'' (byrðr), ''dirt'' (drit), ''dregs'' (dræggiaʀ), ''egg'' (ægg, related to OE. cognate "æg" which became Middle English "eye"/"eai"), ''fellow'' (félagi), ''gap'' (gap), ''husband'' (húsbóndi), ''cake'' (kaka), ''keel'' (kiǫlʀ, stem also kial-, kil-), ''kid'' (kið), ''knife'' (knífʀ), ''law'' (lǫg, stem lag-), ''leg'' (læggʀ), ''link'' (hlænkʀ), ''loan'' (lán, related to OE. cognate "læn", cf. lend), ''race'' (rǫs, stem rás-), ''root'' (rót, related to OE. cognate "wyrt", cf. [[List of wort plants|wort]]), ''sale'' (sala), ''scrap'' (skrap), ''seat'' (sæti), ''sister'' (systir, related to OE. cognate "sweostor"), ''skill'' (skial/skil), ''skin'' (skinn), ''skirt'' (skyrta vs. the native English ''shirt'' of the same root), ''sky'' (ský), ''slaughter'' (slátr), ''snare'' (snara), ''steak'' (stæik), ''thrift'' (þrift), ''tidings'' (tíðindi), ''trust'' (traust), ''window'' (vindauga), ''wing'' (væ(i)ngʀ)
* '''Verbs''' – ''are'' (er, displacing OE "sind") ''blend'' (blanda), ''call'' (kalla), ''cast'' (kasta), ''clip'' (klippa), ''crawl'' (krafla), ''cut'' (possibly from ON kuta), ''die'' (døyia), ''gasp'' (gæispa), ''get'' (geta), ''give'' (gifa/gefa, related to OE. cognate "giefan"), ''glitter'' (glitra), ''hit'' (hitta), ''lift'' (lyfta), ''raise'' (ræisa), ''ransack'' (rannsaka), ''rid'' (ryðia), ''run'' (rinna, stem rinn-/rann-/runn-, related to OE. cognate "rinnan"), ''scare'' (skirra), ''scrape'' (skrapa), ''seem'' (søma), ''sprint'' (sprinta), ''take'' (taka), ''thrive'' (þrífa(s)), ''thrust'' (þrysta), ''want'' (vanta)
* '''Adjectives''' – ''flat'' (flatr), ''happy'' (happ), ''ill'' (illr), ''likely'' (líklígʀ), ''loose'' (lauss), ''low'' (lágʀ), ''meek'' (miúkʀ), ''odd'' (odda), ''rotten'' (rotinn/rutinn), ''scant'' (skamt), ''sly'' (sløgʀ), ''weak'' (væikʀ), ''wrong'' (vrangʀ)
* '''Adverbs''' – ''thwart/athwart'' (þvert)
* '''Prepositions''' – ''till'' (til), ''fro'' (frá)
* '''Conjunction''' – though/tho (þó)
* '''Interjection''' – ''hail'' (hæill), ''wassail'' (ves hæill)
* '''Personal pronoun''' – ''they'' (þæiʀ), ''their'' (þæiʀa), ''them'' (þæim) (for which the Anglo-Saxons said ''híe'',{{sfn|O'Donoghue|?|pp=190–201}}{{Citation not found}}{{sfn|Lass|1993|pp=187–188}} ''hiera'', ''him'')
* '''Prenominal adjectives''' – ''same'' (sami)

In a simple sentence like "They are both weak" the extent of the Old Norse loanwords becomes quite clear (Old East Norse with archaic pronunciation: "Þæiʀ eʀu báðiʀ wæikiʀ" while Old English "híe syndon bégen (þá) wáce"). The words "they" and "weak" are both borrowed from Old Norse, and the word "both" might also be a borrowing, though this is disputed (cf. German ''beide'').{{who|date=December 2010}} While the number of loanwords adopted from the Norse was not as numerous as that of Norman French or Latin, their depth and everyday nature make them a substantial and very important part of every day English speech as they are part of the very core of the modern English vocabulary.

Words like "bull" and "Thursday" are more difficult when it comes to their origins.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} "Bull" may be from either Old English "bula" or Old Norse "buli",{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} while "Thursday" may be a borrowing, or it could simply be from the Old English "Þunresdæg", which could have been influenced by the Old Norse cognate.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The word "are" is from Old English "earun"/"aron", which stems back to Proto-Germanic as well as the Old Norse cognates.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

'''Pacific Biological Laboratories''', abbreviated '''PBL''',  was a biological supply house that sold [[Taxidermy|preserved animal]]s and prepared specimen [[microscope slide]]s, many of which were of [[sea|maritime]] [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] species, to schools, museums, and research institutions. It was located in a building on what is now [[Monterey, California|Monterey's]] [[Cannery Row]] on [[Monterey Bay]] in [[Monterey County, California]].

The building, activities, and business were fictionalized as "Western Biological Laboratory" by [[John Steinbeck]] in his novel ''[[Cannery Row (novel)|Cannery Row]]'', as was a character based on one of its founders, [[Ed Ricketts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==
The  company was started by Ed Ricketts with his college roommate and business partner Albert Galigher in 1923.  Originally located in [[Pacific Grove, California|Pacific Grove]] at 165 Fountain Avenue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Ricketts, he is not "Doc" | accessdate=2007-10-08| publisher=www.caviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the lab was moved to 740 Ocean View Avenue, [[Monterey, California]] around January, 1930,&lt;ref name="Tamm" &gt;{{cite book

  | title =Beyond the Outer Shores
  | publisher =Four Walls Eight Windows
  | year =2004
  | pages =4
  | isbn =1-56858-298-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where Ricketts became sole owner. Today, that location is 800 Cannery Row.  As a result of marital problems between Ricketts and his first wife Anna, the lab served as Ricketts's home for some time beginning in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ecotopia.org/ehof/ricketts/index.html| title=Ecology Hall of Fame Ed Ricketts 1897-1948
| accessdate=2007-08-10| publisher=www.ecotopia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 1936, a fire broke out at the Del Mar Cannery next to the lab (site of today's [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]]) and most of the contents of the laboratory were destroyed. The manuscript for ''[[Between Pacific Tides]]'' survived the fire as it had already been sent to [[Stanford University]] for publication.  It was Steinbeck that saved the lab financially after the fire with the purchase of half the company's stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Beyond the Outer Shores| last=Tamm| first=Eric| publisher = Four Walls Eight Windows|year = 2004| pages = 49| isbn=0-521-41038-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of [[World War II]] led to the decline of the commercial operation of the lab. However, the legacy of the specimens collected and distributed by PBL lives on.  Museums throughout the United States contain specimens collected by Ricketts, including the [[Field Museum]] in Chicago, the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[California Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] at [[Harvard University]] and the Museum of Zoology at [[Lund University]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Tamm" /&gt;

The  lab became a meeting place for intellectuals, artists, and writers, including [[Bruce Ariss]], [[Joseph Campbell]], [[Henry Miller]], John Steinbeck, [[Lincoln Steffens]], and [[Francis Whitaker]].
===Catalog===
Ricketts produced his first scientific publication, a catalog of marine biological specimens recorded in photographs and drawings. Originally meant for advertisement it may well have been the first record of Monterey Bay intertidal species.&lt;ref name="Jr.2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward F. Ricketts Jr.|title=Breaking Through: Essays, Journals, and Travelogues of Edward F. Ricketts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4vCCNpiDPQC&amp;pg=PA80|date=20 May 2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93266-1|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation and Legacy==
{{stack|[[File:Pacific Biological Laboratories, exterior 3.jpg|thumb|upright|The back of the lab, with tanks for specimens]]}}
After his death the lab was bought by many of Ricketts' old friends who continued meeting there every Wednesday evening very much like in the past. They sold the building to the city of Monterey in 1993. It was restored by the Cannery Row Foundation which was given the Governor's Award for Historic Preservation.

On May 14, 1997, the 100th anniversary of Ricketts' birth, a commemorative plaque was placed on the 165 Fountain Avenue location by the Pacific Grove Heritage Society and the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History Association. The Pacific Biological Laboratories is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">The theme of '''poet as legislator''' reached its [[Grandiosity|grandiose]] peak in the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]],&lt;ref&gt;C. Prendergast ed., ''Cultural Materialism'' (1995) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; epitomised in the view of the lonely, alienated poet as 'unacknowledged legislator' to the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Holmes, ''Dr Johnson and Mr Savage'' (1994) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

However the concept had a long prehistory in Western culture, with classical figures like [[Orpheus]] or [[Solon]] being appealed to as precedents for the poet's civilising role.&lt;ref&gt;D. Griffin, ''Patriotism and Poetry in Eighteenth-Century Britain'' (2005) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical origins==

[[Plato]]'s opposition to poets in his ideal Republic was predicated on the contemporary existence of [[Homer]]ic expounders who claimed that "a man ought to regulate the tenour of his whole life by this poet's directions".&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Davies/D. J. Vaughan trans., ''The Republic of Plato'' (1908) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Plato only allowed the already censured poet to guide the young, to be an acknowledged legislator at the price of total external control.&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Castle, ''Ancient Education and Today'' (1969) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Less threatened by the poetic role, the Romans by contrast saw poetry, with [[Horace]], as primarily pleasing, and only secondarily as instructive.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance and Augustan views==

Building the view of the fifteenth century Florentine [[Neoplatonism in the Renaissance|Neoplatonists]] on the poet as seer,&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; however, [[Sir Philip Sidney]] developed a more powerful concept of the poet as overtopping the philosopher, historian and lawyer to stand out as "the monarch...of all sciences.&lt;ref&gt;J. A van Dorsten ed, ''Sidney: A Defence of Poetry'' (1984) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a viewpoint was more or less institutionalised in [[Augustan literature]], Johnson's [[Rasselas]] maintaining for example that the poet "must write as the interpreter of nature and the legislator of mankind"&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''Rasselas'' (1905) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; – a fully public, even patriotic role moreover&lt;ref&gt;D. Griffin, ''Patriotism and Poetry in Eighteenth-Century Britain'' (2005) p. 71-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic peaks==

By contrast the Romantic view of the poet as ''unackowledged'' legislator emerges at the turm of the century in the writing of [[William Godwin]], with his anarchic view of the poet as "the legislator of generations and the moral instructor of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. A. Carlson, ''England's First Family of Writers'' (2007) p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

It received its most memorable formulation however in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s 1820 "[[A Defence of Poetry]]".&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley maintained that, through their powers of imaginative understanding, 'Poets' (in the widest sense, of ancient Greece) were able to identify and formulate emerging socio-cultural trends; and were as a result "the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration...the unacknowledged legislators of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernist irony==

The grand claims of the Romantics began to give way in the twentieth century to a more ironic stance&lt;ref&gt;S. Chatterji, ''Memories of a Lost War'' (2001) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Yeats]] speaking for his calling in general when he wrote "We have no gift to set a statesman right".&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (1984) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

What remained of the Shelley claim was to be further diminished by [[Postmodernism]]'s distrust for grand narratives, if not perhaps destroyed entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/node/33792 Tools of the Sacred]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all discussions of polarization in [[political science]] consider polarization in the context of [[political party|political parties]] and democratic systems of government. When polarization occurs in a [[two-party system]], like the [[United States]], moderate voices often lose power and influence.&lt;ref name = dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=mann-12&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mann |first=Thomas E. |author2=Ornstein, Norman J. |title=It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American constitutional system collided with the new politics of extremism | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQORs1_S2sgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705154533/http://books.google.com/books?id=CQORs1_S2sgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2014-07-05 | publisher=[[Basic Books]] | year=2012 | isbn=978-0465031337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarty|first=Nolan|title=Polarized America : the dance of ideology and unequal riches|year=2006|publisher=MIT Press|at=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0262134644 |author2=Poole, Keith T. |author3=Rosenthal, Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and measurements==

Political polarization refers to the cases in which an individual's stance on a given issue, policy, or person is more likely to be strictly defined by their identification with a particular political party (e.g., [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) or [[political ideology|ideology]] (e.g., [[liberalism|liberal]] or [[conservatism|conservative]]).&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Alan I.|author2=Saunders, Kyle L.|title=Is Polarization a Myth?|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=27 March 2008|volume=70|issue=2|page=542|doi=10.1017/S0022381608080493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bafumi-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bafumi|first=Joseph|author2=Shapiro, Robert Y.|title=A New Partisan Voter|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=27 January 2009|volume=71|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.1017/S0022381608090014|url=http://ftp.columbia.edu/cu/alliance/documents/EDF/Monday/Shapiro_Bafumi_reading.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to DiMaggio et al. (1996), "Polarization is both a state and a process. Polarization as a state refers to the extent to which opinions on an issue are opposed in relation to some theoretical maximum. Polarization as a process refers to the increase in such opposition over time."&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt; Some political scientists argue that polarization requires divergence on a broad range of issues based on a consistent set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt; Others argue polarization occurs when there are stark partisan or ideological divides, even if the opinion is polarized only on a few issues.&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=bafumi-09/&gt;

Political scientists typically distinguish between two types of political polarization: elite polarization and popular polarization. "Elite polarization" refers to the polarization of political elites, like [[party organizer]]s and [[elected officials]], while "popular polarization" (or mass polarization) refers to the polarization in the electorate and general public. In either context, opinions and policy positions are characterized by strict adherence to [[party line (politics)|party lines]]. Elite polarization and popular polarization can occur at the same time or independent of each other. A central issue in the study of political polarization is investigating the relationship between elite polarization and popular polarization, particularly any causal relationships between the two.&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Marc J.|title=Review Article: Putting Polarization in Perspective|journal=British Journal of Political Science|date=17 February 2009|volume=39|issue=2|page=413|doi=10.1017/S0007123408000501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06&gt;{{cite journal|last=Layman|first=Geoffrey C.|author2=Carsey, Thomas M. |author3=Horowitz, Juliana Menasce |title=Party Polarization in American Politics: Characteristics, Causes, and Consequences|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=1 June 2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=83–110|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.070204.105138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmines|first=E.

===Elite polarization===

[[File:NOMINATE polarization.jpg|thumb|Political polarization in the United States House of Representatives (DW-Nominate scores)]]
Elite polarization refers to polarization in the party-in-government and party-as-organization.&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt; It occurs when party members (both elected government officials and activists within the party organization itself) grow more internally homogenous on policy positions and more divergent relative to members of other parties. Polarized political parties are internally cohesive, unified, programmatic, and ideologically distinct; they are typically found in a [[parliamentary system]] of democratic governance.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt; 

In a [[two-party system]] like the U.S., a polarized [[legislature]] has two important characteristics: first, there is little-to-no ideological overlap between members of the two parties; and second, almost all conflict over legislation and policies is split across the broad liberal/conservative ideological divide. This leads to the conflation of political parties and ideologies (i.e., Democrat and Republican become nearly perfect synonyms for liberal and conservative) and the collapse of the ideological center.&lt;ref name="mann-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carmines-12" /&gt;

The vast majority of studies on elite polarization focus on legislative and deliberative bodies. For many years, political scientists measured polarization by examining the ratings of party members published by interest groups, but now, most analyze [[recorded vote|roll-call voting]] patterns to determine trends in party-line voting and party unity.&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty-06" /&gt; Many political scientists studying American politics rely on Poole and Rosenthal's [[NOMINATE (scaling method)|DW-NOMINATE scores]], which assign a single liberal-conservative score to each congressperson, enabling comparisons of members from different Congresses. There is much more research on polarization in Congress than on polarization in the other branches of government or in state governments.&lt;ref name="McCarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hetherington-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt; Azzimonti's political polarization index is more comprehensive instead because it is based on media coverage of newspaper articles reporting political disagreement about policy in all branches of government.&lt;ref&gt;Azzimonti, Marina "[http://marina-azzimonti.com/papers/Polariz2.pdf The political polarization index]"&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work by Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy has used the text of the Congressional Record to document differences in speech patterns between Republicans and Democrats as a measure of polarization. They find that polarization has increased dramatically since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Gentzkow, Matthew, and Shapiro, Jesse, and Taddy, Matt [http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/politext.pdf Measuring Polarization in High-Dimensional Data: Method and Application to Congressional Speech]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular polarization===

Popular polarization, or mass polarization, occurs when the electorate's attitudes towards political issues, policies, and people are starkly divided along partisan lines. Members of the electorate and general public typically become less moderate in cases of popular polarization.&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Claassen|first=R.L.|author2=Highton, B.|title=Policy Polarization among Party Elites and the Significance of Political Awareness in the Mass Public|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=9 September 2008|volume=62|issue=3|pages=538–551|doi=10.1177/1065912908322415}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., media accounts typically simplify popular polarization to a divide between [[red states and blue states]] or a "[[Culture war#United States of America|culture war]]" between values-voters and progressives. Political scientists, though, generally agree that such accounts are too simplistic and ignore the complex factors that can account for polarization.&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fiorina |first=Morris P. |author2=Samuel A. Abrams |author3=Jeremy C. Pope |title=Culture War? The Myth of a Polarized America | publisher=[[Pearson Longman]] | year=2006 | isbn=978-0321276407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many political scientists consider political polarization a top-down process, in which elite polarization leads to – or at least precedes – popular polarization. However, polarization among elites does not necessarily produce polarization within the electorate, and polarized electoral choices can often reflect elite polarization rather than voters' preferences.&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08/&gt;

Political scientists studying popular polarization typically rely on data from [[opinion polls]] and election surveys. They look for trends in respondents' opinions on a given issue, their voting history, and their political ideology (conservative, liberal, moderate, etc.), and they try to relate those trends to respondents' party identification and other potentially polarizing factors (like geographic location or income bracket).&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt; Political scientists typically limit their inquiry to issues and questions that have been constant over time, in order to compare the present day to what the political climate has historically been.&lt;ref name=claassen-08/&gt; Oft-cited public opinion polls in the U.S. include those run by the [[Pew Research Center]] and [[Gallup, Inc.]], while political scientists also rely on more academic surveys, like the [[General Social Survey]] and the election surveys and "feeling thermometer" polls conducted by [[National Election Studies]].&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08/&gt;

==Causes==
There are various causes of political polarization and these include political parties, [[redistricting]], the public's [[political ideologies|political ideology]], and the mass media.

===Party polarization===
Some scholars argue that diverging parties has been one of the major driving forces of polarization as policy platforms have become more distant. This theory is based on recent trends in the [[United States Congress]], where the [[majority party]] prioritizes the positions that are most aligned with its [[party platform]] and political ideology.&lt;ref name=ura-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ura|first=Joseph Daniel|author2=Ellis, Christopher R.|title=Partisan Moods: Polarization and the Dynamics of Mass Party Preferences|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=10 February 2012|volume=74|issue=1|pages=277–291|doi=10.1017/S0022381611001587}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of more ideologically distinct positions by political parties can cause polarization among both elites and the electorate. For example, after the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]], the number of conservative Democrats in Congress decreased, while the number of conservative Republicans increased. Within the electorate during the 1970s, [[Southern Democrats]] shifted toward the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], showing polarization among both the elites and the electorate of both main parties.&lt;ref name=mann-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-98&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Alan I.|author2=Saunders, Kyle L.|title=Ideological Realignment in the U.S. Electorate|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=August 1998|volume=60|issue=3|page=634|doi=10.2307/2647642|jstor=10.2307/2647642}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=galston-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galston|first=William A.|title=Political Polarization and the U.S. Judiciary|journal=UKMC Law Review|year=2009|volume=77|issue=207|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/umkc77&amp;div=15&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists have shown politicians have an incentive to advance and support polarized positions.&lt;ref name=beniers-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beniers|first=Klaas J.|author2=Dur, Robert|title=Politicians’ motivation, political culture, and electoral competition|journal=International Tax and Public Finance|date=1 February 2007|volume=14|issue=1|pages=29–54|doi=10.1007/s10797-006-8878-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; These argue that during the early 1990s, the Republican Party used polarizing tactics to become the majority party in the [[United States House of Representatives]]—which political scientists [[Thomas E. Mann]] and [[Norman Ornstein]] refer to as [[Newt Gingrich]]'s "guerrilla war."&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt; What political scientists have found is that moderates are less likely to run than are candidates who are in line with party doctrine, otherwise known as "party fit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomsen|first1=Danielle M.|title=Ideological Moderates Won't Run: How Party Fit Matters for Partisan Polarization in Congress|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=2014|volume=76|issue=3|pages=786–797|doi=10.1017/s0022381614000243|jstor=0022381614000243}}&lt;/ref&gt;Other theories state politicians who cater to more extreme groups within their party tend to be more successful, helping them stay in office while simultaneously pulling their constituency toward a polar extreme.&lt;ref name=hirano-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirano|first=Shigeo, Jr. |author2=James M. Snyder |author3=Michael M. Ting|title=Distributive Politics with Primaries|journal=Journal of Politics|year=2009|volume=71|issue=4|pages=1467–1480|url=http://www.yale.org/leitner/resources/docs/snyder.pdf|doi=10.1017/s0022381609990247}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Nicholson (2012) found voters are more polarized by contentious statements from leaders of the opposing party than from the leaders of their own party. As a result, political leaders may be more likely to take polarized stances.&lt;ref name=nicholson-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=Stephen P.|title=Polarizing Cues|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1 January 2012|volume=56|issue=1|pages=52–66|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00541.x|pmid=22400143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to [[multiparty systems]], [[Giovanni Sartori]] (1966, 1976) claims the splitting of ideologies in the public constituency causes further divides within the political parties of the countries. He theorizes that the extremism of public ideological movement is the basis for the creation of highly polarized multiparty systems. Sartori named this polarizing phenomenon [[polarized pluralism]] and claimed it would lead to further polarization in many opposing directions (as opposed to in simply two directions, as in a polarized two-party system) over policy issues.&lt;ref name=sartori-66&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sartori|first=Giovanni|title=European political parties: the case of polarized pluralism|journal=Political Parties and Political Development|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sartori-76&gt;{{cite book|last=Sartori|first=Giovanni|title=Parties and party systems : a framework for analysis|year=1976|publisher=ECPR|location=Colchester|isbn=978-0954796617|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywr0CcGDNHwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=[Nouvelle édition]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnston-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Richard|title=Polarized Pluralism in the Canadian Party System: Presidential Address to the Canadian Political Science Association, June 5, 2008|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science|date=17 December 2008|volume=41|issue=4|page=815|doi=10.1017/S0008423908081110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polarization in multiparty systems can also be defined along two ideological extremes, like in the case of [[India]] in the 1970s. Ideological splits within a number of India's major parties resulted in two polarized coalitions on the right and left, each consisting of multiple political parties.&lt;ref name=davey-72&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davey|first=Hampton|title=Polarization and Consensus in Indian Party Politics|journal=Asian Survey|date=1 August 1972|volume=12|issue=8|pages=701–716|doi=10.2307/2643110|jstor=10.2307/2643110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political fund-raisers and donors can also exert significant influence and control over legislators. Party leaders are expected to be productive fund-raisers, in order to support the party's campaigns. After ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'', special interests in the U.S. were able to greatly impact elections through increased undisclosed spending, notably through [[Super PACs|Super political action committees]]. Some, such as ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' opinion writer [[Robert G. Kaiser|Robert Kaiser]], argued this allowed wealthy people, corporations, unions, and other groups to push the parties' policy platforms toward ideological extremes, resulting in a state of greater polarization.&lt;ref name=mann-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser-10&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Robert G.|title=So damn much money : the triumph of lobbying and the corrosion of American government|year=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0307385888|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJxU1MzQZVoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Raymond J. La Raja and David L. Wiltse, note that this does not necessarily hold true for mass donors to political campaigns. These scholars argue a single donor who is polarized and contributes large sums to a campaign does not seem to usually drive a politician toward political extremes.&lt;ref name=la-raja-11&gt;{{cite journal|last=La Raja|first=R.J.|author2=Wiltse, D.L.|title=Don't Blame Donors for Ideological Polarization of Political Parties: Ideological Change and Stability Among Political Contributors, 1972–2008|journal=American Politics Research|date=13 December 2011|volume=40|issue=3|pages=501–530|doi=10.1177/1532673X11429845|url=http://apr.sagepub.com/content/40/3/501.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tam-cho-07"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tam Cho|first=Wendy K.|author2=Gimpel, James G.|title=Prospecting for (Campaign) Gold|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1 April 2007|volume=51|issue=2|pages=255–268|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00249.x|url=http://cho.pol.illinois.edu/wendy/papers/krige.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The public===
In democracies and other [[Representative democracy|representative governments]], citizens vote for the political actors who will represent them. Some scholars argue that political polarization reflects the public's ideology and voting preferences.&lt;ref name=galston-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=garner-10&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garner | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Palmer | first2 = Harvey | title = Polarization and issue consistency over time | journal = [[Political Behavior (journal)|Political Behavior]] | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–246 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s11109-010-9136-7 | date = June 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11109-010-9136-7 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mason-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=Lilliana |title=The rise of uncivil agreement: issue versus behavioral polarization in the American electorate|journal=[[American Behavioral Scientist]]|date=January 2013|volume=57|issue=1|pages=140–159 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] |doi= 10.1177/0002764212463363 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764212463363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=murakami-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murakami|first=Michael H.|title=How party polarization affects candidate evaluations: the role of ideology|journal=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Hyatt Regency Chicago and the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers, Chicago, Illinois |year=2007|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/1/0/3/3/pages210336/p210336-1.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixit and Weibull (2007) claim that political polarization is a natural and regular phenomenon. They argue that there is a link between public differences in ideology and the polarization of representatives, but that an increase in preference differences is usually temporary and ultimately results in compromise.&lt;ref name=dixit-07&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixit|first1=Avinash K. | last2 = Weibull |first2= Jörgen W. |title=Political polarization|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|date=1 May 2007|volume=104|issue=18 |pages=7351–7356 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702071104 | jstor = 25427490 | publisher = [[National Academy of Sciences]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0702071104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morris P. Fiorina]] (2006, 2008) posits the hypothesis that polarization is a phenomenon which does not hold for the public, and instead is formulated by commentators to draw further division in government.&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=fiorina-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=born-94&gt;{{cite journal|last=Born|first=Richard|title=[Split-ticket voters, divided government, and Fiorina's policy-balancing model]: rejoinder|journal=[[Legislative Studies Quarterly]]|date=February 1994|volume=19 |issue=1 | publisher = [[American Political Science Association]] |jstor=439804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies indicate that cultural differences focusing on ideological movements and geographical polarization within the United States constituency is correlated with rises in overall political polarization between 1972 and 2004.&lt;ref name=abramowitz-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-05&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~govt/docs/Abramowitz.pdf | last1 = Abramowitz | first1 = Alan | last2 = Saunders | first2 = Kyle L. | title = Why can't we all just get along?

Religious, ethnic, and other cultural divides within the public have often influenced the emergence of polarization. According to Layman et al. (2005), the ideological split between U.S. Republicans and Democrats also crosses into the religious cultural divide. They claim that Democrats have generally become more [[moderate]] in religious views whereas Republicans have become more traditionalist. For example, political scientists have shown that in the United States, voters who identify as Republican are more likely to vote for a strongly [[evangelical]] candidate than Democratic voters.&lt;ref name=campbell-11&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=David E.|last2 = Green | first2 = John C. | last3 = Layman | first3 = Geoffrey C. |title=The party faithful: partisan images, candidate religion, and the electoral impact of party identification|journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]]|date= January 2011|volume=55|issue=1|pages=42–58 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00474.x | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00474.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlates with the rise in polarization in the United States.&lt;ref name=layman-05&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Layman |first1= Geoffrey C. | last2 =Green | first2 = John C. |title=Wars and rumours of wars: the contexts of cultural conflict in American political behaviour|journal=[[British Journal of Political Science]]|date=January 2006|volume=36|issue=1 |pages=61–89 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0007123406000044 | jstor = 4092316 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007123406000044  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory contends that religion does not contribute to full-group polarization, but rather, [[coalition]] and party activist polarization causes party shifts toward a political extreme.&lt;ref name=brooks-04&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sociology.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/A_Great_Divide.pdf|last=Brooks|first=Clem|author2=Manza, Jeff|title=A great divide?

In some post-colonial countries, the public may be polarized along ethnic divides that remain from the colonial regime.&lt;ref name=bhavnani-08&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhavnani|first1=Ravi | last2 =Miodownik | first2= Dan|title=Ethnic polarization, ethnic salience, and Civil War |journal=[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]] |date=February 2009 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=30–49 |doi=10.1177/0022002708325945 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022002708325945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Africa]] in the late 1980s, members of the conservative, pro-apartheid [[National Party of South Africa]] were no longer supportive of [[apartheid]], and, therefore, no longer ideologically aligned with their party. Dutch [[Afrikaners]], white English, and native Africans split based on racial divisions, causing polarization along ethnic lines.&lt;ref name=sisk-89&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sisk|first=Timothy D.|title=White politics in South Africa: politics under pressure|journal=[[Africa Today]]|date=January 1989|volume=36|issue=1 |pages=29–39 | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] |jstor=4186531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darity-09&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cpc.unc.edu/research/publications/3710| last = Darity | first = William A. | contribution = Economic theory and racial economic inequality | editor-last1 = Dodson | editor-first1 = Howard | editor-last2 = Palmer | editor-first2 = Colin A. | title = The Black condition | pages = 1–43 | publisher = Michigan State University Press | location = East Lansing, Michigan | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0870138386 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic inequality]] can also motivate the polarization of the public. For example, in post-[[World War I]] [[Germany]], the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany|Communist Workers Party]], and the [[Nazism|National Socialists]], a [[fascism|fascist]] party, emerged as the dominant political ideologies and proposed to address Germany's economic problems in drastically different ways.&lt;ref name=sartori-66/&gt;&lt;ref name=sartori-76/&gt; In [[Venezuela]] in the late 20th century, the entrance of the oil industry into the local economy caused economic disparities that led to sharp ideological divides. As a result, the disenfranchised working class aligned with extreme [[socialism|socialist]] leader [[Hugo Chávez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lombardi |first=John V. |contribution=Prologue: Venezuela's Permanent Dilemma |editor1-last=Ellner |editor1-first=Steve |editor2-last=Hellinger |editor2-first=Daniel |date=2004 |title=Venezuelan politics in the Chávez era: class, polarization, and conflict |publisher=Rienner |location=Boulder, Colorado |isbn=978-1588262974 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Venezuelan_Politics_in_the_Ch%C3%A1vez_Era.html?id=uYd4Q1vQluAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redistricting===
[[Gerrymandering]] or the manipulation of the electoral borders to favor a political party or the electoral outcome affect the redistricting process in the U.S. It has been linked to the rise in polarization by some political scientists.&lt;ref name=yoshinaka-11&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yoshinaka|first=Antoine &amp; Chad Murphy|title=The Paradox of Redistricting: How Partisan Mapmakers Foster Competition but Disrupt Representation|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=June 2011|volume=64|issue=2|pages=435–447|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/873115158/|doi=10.1177/1065912909355716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that the practice of redistricting creates political polarization by making more homogeneous, ideologically distinct districts. This results in elected representatives who represent more polarized beliefs.&lt;ref name=thompson-04&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Dennis F.|title=Election Time: Normative Implications of Temporal Properties of the Electoral Process in the United States|journal=American Political Science Review|date=February 2004|volume=98|issue=1|pages=51–64|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPSR%2FPSR98_01%2FS0003055404000991a.pdf&amp;code=2dc646d4d430ae4fef0a6e06d5ccf9fa|doi=10.1017/s0003055404000991}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carson et al. (2007), this makes it easier for more extreme candidates to win elections (and re-election) as the makeup of the voting block shifts in the direction of a polar extreme. This effect is more modest when analyzed over multiple election cycles and in the United States as a whole.&lt;ref name=carson-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carson|first=J.L.|author2=Crespin, M.H. |author3=Finocchiaro, C.J. |author4= Rohde, D.W. |title=Redistricting and Party Polarization in the U.S. House of Representatives|journal=American Politics Research|date=28 September 2007|volume=35|issue=6|pages=878–904|doi=10.1177/1532673X07304263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically motivated redistricting has been associated with the rise in partisanship in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1992 and 1994.&lt;ref name=mckee-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=SEth C.|title=The Effects of Redistricting on Voting Behavior in Incumbent U.S. House Elections, 1992–1994|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=March 2008|volume=61|issue=1|pages=122–133|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/215329960?accountid=10141|doi=10.1177/1065912907306473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kousser-96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kousser|first=J|title=Estimating the Partisan Consequences of Redistricting Plans – Simply|journal=Legislative Studies Quarterly|date=November 1996|volume=21|issue=4|pages=521–541|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/60821189?accountid=10141|doi=10.2307/440460|jstor=440460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many political scientists however, argue that redistricting practices have not played a major role in causing political polarization.

===The media===
The mass media has grown as an institution over the past half-century. Political scientists argue that this has particularly affected the voting public in the last three decades, as previously less partisan viewers are given more polarized news media choices. The mass media's current, fragmented, high-choice environment has induced a movement of the audience from more even-toned political programming to more antagonistic and one-sided broadcasts and articles. These programs tend to appeal to partisan viewers who watch the polarized programming as a self-confirming source for their ideologies.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=hollander-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=B.A.|title=Tuning Out or Tuning Elsewhere?

(2010). ''Program or be programmed: Ten commands for a digital age.'' Berkeley, CA: Soft Skull Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This method of personalizing web content results in ''[[filter bubble]]s'', a term coined by digital activist [[Eli Pariser]] that refers to the polarized ideological bubbles that are created by computer algorithms filtering out unrelated information and opposing views.&lt;ref&gt;Pariser, E. (2011). ''The filter bubble: What the internet is hiding from you''. New York, NY: The Penguin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study found ideological segregation of online news consumption is lower than the segregation of most offline news consumption and lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gentzkow|first=Matthew|last2=Shapiro|first2=Jesse M.|date=2011-11-01|title=Ideological Segregation Online and Offline *|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/126/4/1799/1924154/Ideological-Segregation-Online-and-Offline?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=126|issue=4|pages=1799–1839|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr044|issn=0033-5533}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the filter bubbles effects of online media consumption are exaggerated. Other research also shows that online media does not contribute to the increased polarization of opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hohenberg|first=Clemm von|last2=Bernhard|last3=Maes|first3=Michael|last4=Pradelski|first4=Bary S.R.|date=2017-05-25|title=Micro influence and macro dynamics of opinions|ssrn=2974413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that providing people with impartial, objective information has the potential to reduce political polarization, but the effect of information on polarization is highly sensitive to contextual factors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duhaime|first=Erik|last2=Apfelbaum|first2=Evan|date=2017|title=Can Information Decrease Political Polarization? Evidence From the U.S. Taxpayer Receipt |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550616687126|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume=8|issue=7|page=736|language=en|doi=10.1177/1948550616687126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, polarization over government spending was reduced when people were provided with a "Taxpayer Receipt," but not when they were also asked how they wanted the money to be spent.  This suggests that subtle factors like the mood and tone of partisan news sources may have a large effect on how the same information is interpreted.

===The public===

Opinions on polarization's effects on the public are mixed. Some argue that the growing polarization in government has directly contributed to political polarization in the electorate,&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt; but this is not unanimous.&lt;ref name=wilkerson-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=hibbing-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hibbing|first=John R.|author2=Christopher W.

Some scholars argue that polarization lowers public interest in politics, [[party identification]] and [[voter turnout]].&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt; It encourages confrontational dynamics between parties that can lower overall public trust and approval in government.&lt;ref name="hetherington-08"&gt;{{cite book|title=Red and blue nation?

Brady|location=Washington, DC|chapter=Turned Off or Turned On? How Polarization Affects Political Engagement}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and causes the public to perceive the general political debate as less civil,&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=brady-06/&gt; which can alienate voters.

On the other hand, others assert that elite polarization has galvanized the public's political participation in the United States, citing greater voting and nonvoting participation, engagement and investment in campaigns, and increased positive attitude toward government responsiveness.&lt;ref name=hetherington-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=dodson-10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodson|first=Kyle|title=The Return of the American Voter? Party Polarization and Voting Behavior, 1988 to 2004|journal=Sociological Perspectives|date=1 September 2010|volume=53|issue=3|pages=443–449|doi=10.1525/sop.2010.53.3.443|url=http://faculty1.ucmerced.edu/kdodson2/docs/Publications/Dodson_Return%20of%20the%20American%20Voter.pdf}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polarized parties become more ideologically unified, furthering voter knowledge about their positions and increasing their standard to similarly-aligned voters.&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dodson-10" /&gt;

===The media===

As Mann and Ornstein argue, political polarization and the proliferation of media sources have "reinforce[d] tribal divisions, while enhancing a climate where facts are no longer driving the debate and deliberation, nor are they shared by the larger public."&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;  As other scholars have argued, the media often support and provoke the stall and closed rules tactics that disrupt regular policy procedure.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=mutz-06&gt;{{cite book|last=Mutz|first=Diana C.|title=Red and blue nation? Volume One: characteristics and causes of America's polarized politics|year=2006|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0815760832|chapter=How the Mass Media Divide Us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the media are not immune to general public opinion and reduced polarization allows them to appeal to a larger audience,&lt;ref name=rosenstiel-06&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenstiel|first=Thomas|title=Red and blue nation? Volume One: characteristics and causes of America's polarized politics|year=2006|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0815760832|chapter=Two Alternative Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; polarized environments make it easier for the media and [[advocacy group|interest groups]] to hold elected officials more accountable for their policy promises and positions,&lt;ref name="epstein-07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mutz-06" /&gt; generally healthy for democracy.&lt;ref name="epstein-07" /&gt;

===Judicial systems===

[[Judicial system]]s can also be affected by the implications of political polarization. For the United States, in particular, polarization lowers confirmation rates of judges;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; In 2012, the confirmation rate of presidential circuit court appointments was approximately 50% as opposed to the above 90% rate in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt; More polarized parties have more aggressively block nominees and used tactics to hinder executive agendas.&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;&lt;ref name=dionne-10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dionne|first=E.J., Jr.|author2=William A. Galston|title=A Half-Empty Government Can't Govern: Why Everyone Wants to Fix the Appointments Process, Why It Never Happens, and How We Can Get It Done|journal=Brookings|date=14 December 2010|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2010/12/14-appointments-galston-dionne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Sarah Binder (2000) argues that "senatorial intolerance for the opposing party’s nominees is itself a function of polarization."&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; Negative consequences of this include higher vacancy rates on appellate courts, longer case-processing times and increased caseloads for judges.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=galston-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;

Political scientists argue that in highly polarized periods, nominees become less reflective of the moderate voter as "polarization impacts the appointment and ideological tenor of new federal judges."&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; It also influences the politics of senatorial [[advice and consent]], giving partisan presidents the power to appoint judges far to the left or right of center on the federal bench, obstructing the legitimacy of the judicial branch.&lt;ref name=galston-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;

Ultimately, the increasing presence of ideology in a judicial system impacts the judiciary's credibility.&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;  Polarization can generate strong partisan critiques of federal judges, which can damage the public perception of the justice system and the legitimacy of the courts as nonpartisan legal arbiters.&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;&lt;ref name="wittes-08"&gt;{{cite book|title=Red and blue nation? Volume Two: Consequences and Correction of America's Polarized Politics|last=Wittes|first=Benjamin|publisher=Brookings|year=2008|isbn=978-0815760801|editor=Pietro S. Nivola &amp; David W. Brady|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|location=Washington, DC|chapter=Comments on Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Foreign policy===

Political polarization can undercut unified agreement on [[foreign policy]] and harm a nation's international standing;&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccormick-90&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=James M.|author2=Eugene R. Wittkopf|title=Bipartisanship, Partisanship, and Ideology in Congressional-Executive Foreign Policy Relations, 1947–1988|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=November 1990|volume=52|issue=4|pages=1077–1100|url=http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~lorenzo/McCormick%20Wittkopf%20Bipartisanship.pdf|doi=10.2307/2131683}}&lt;/ref&gt; divisiveness on foreign affairs  strengthens enemies, discourages allies and destabilize a nation's determination.&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;

Political scientists point to two primary implications of polarization with regards to the [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy of the United States"]]. First, when the United States conducts relations abroad and appears divided, allies are less likely to trust its promises, enemies are more likely to predict its weaknesses, and uncertainty as to the country's position in world affairs rises.&lt;ref name="mccormick-90" /&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson-08&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=James Q.|title=Red and blue nation?

== Global Perspective ==
Outside of the U.S., there are plenty of modern day examples of polarization in politics. A bulk of the research into global polarization comes from Europe. One example includes [[Pasokification]] in Greece. This is the trend from a shift from the center-left to a more far-left stance. Pasokification was caused by the Greek populous growing dissatisfied with the country's centrist, left wing party and how they handled the [[Great Recession]] and the austerity measures the European Union put in place during recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackwater|first=Bill|date=Summer 2016|title=Morality and left-wing politics: a case study of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party|url=|journal=Renewal|volume=24|pages=|via=Gale Literature Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the shift further to the left was a massive benefits to the liberal population in Greece, the results in Greece (as well as other nations like Germany, Sweden and Italy) have not been able to sustain themselves. Parties who have made the shift left have recently shown a decline in the voting booths, evidence their supporters are uneasy of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eaton|first=George|date=2018|title=Corbynism 2.0|url=|journal=New Statesman|volume=147|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The shift in Greece to the far-left is similar to the shift in countries like Poland, France and the U.K. to more far-right conservative positions. In those countries, there is heavy anti-Islam sentiment and the rise of [[Populism|populist]] commentary. The general population of the right in these countries tends to hold onto these more aggressive stances and pulls the parties further to the right. These stances include populist messages with Islamophobic, isolationist, and anti-LGBTQ language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarkov|first=Dubravka|date=2017-06-16|title=Populism, polarization and social justice activism|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=197–201|doi=10.1177/1350506817713439|issn=1350-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palonen|first=Emilia|date=2009|title=Political Polarisation and Populism in Contemporary Hungary|url=|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=62|pages=318-334|via=Electronic Journal Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the polarization in these nations leads to either a more socialist left wing party, or more nationalist right wing party. These more polarized parties grow from the discontent of more moderate parties inability to provide progressive changes in either direction.   

== Critiques ==
There have long been numerous scholarly debates that argue over the concept of political polarization, both in whether it is valid, and how it can accurately be measured. There are four primary arguments against the validity of political polarization: 1) Limitations of the Two-Party System, 2) Issue Partisanship, 3) Cultural Differences, and 4) Westernized Focuses.

=== Limitations of the two-party system ===
By solely acknowledging voting patterns, one cannot make an accurate conclusion as to the presence or absence of political polarization, because in the United States, there is a limited number of presidential candidates in the two-party system. To assume that the majority of voters are mostly or completely in agreement with the plethora of political issues within their party is a false assumption.&lt;ref name="Baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-06" /&gt; Despite contrary beliefs, there are many liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats in the U.S. who have differing political beliefs within their parties. However, these voters most often align with their party because of the limited choice of candidates, and to do otherwise (i.e. vote for a third-party candidate) is perceived as a waste of time.&lt;ref name="Baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;

=== Issue partisanship ===
Despite various claims that argue American society is more polarized today than leading up to the U.S. Civil War,&lt;ref name="abramowitz-08" /&gt; numerous scholars explain that much evidence shows there is a relatively stable public opinion on the majority of sociopolitical issues.&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Religion, politics, and support for same-sex marriage in the United States, 1988–2008|last = Sherkat|first = Darren|date = 2011|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the most polarization exists, rather, is in the "hot topic" or "sensitive" issues (e.g. abortion, gay marriage, U.S. involvement in war).&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Polarization, secularization, or differences as usual? The denominational cleavage in U.S. social attitudes since the 1970s.|last = Bolzendahl|first = |date = 2005|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-reliance on focusing on opinions regarding social issues to draw conclusion about political polarization is not a valid measurement to fully represent the concept.&lt;ref name="fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06" /&gt;

In regard to views on public policies, Fiorina and Abrams (2008) found virtually no evidence of an increase in widespread political polarization over the past thirty years. Nonetheless, many scholars explain that it is not an increase in ideological coherence among individuals which separates them; it is the partisan extremism (i.e. Democrat v. Republican) which eventually separates voters into one party or the other.&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Political polarization projection: Social projection of partisan attitude extremity and attitudinal processes.|last = Van Boven|first = |date = 2012|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Religious convictions and political choice|last = Greenawalt|first = Kent|publisher = |year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural differences ===
Proponents of the cultural differences argument are critical of political polarization because of numerous factors, influences, and demographics.&lt;ref name="abramowitz-05" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Purple America|last = Ansolabehere|first = |date = 2006|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The future of red, blue and purple America.|last = Teixeira|first = |publisher = |year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among voter demographic features, there is much evidence of race, sex, age, and educational attainment as being some of the main influences in voting behaviors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130123073800/http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|dead-url =yes|archive-date =2013-01-23|title =U.S. elections: How groups voted in 2012|date =2012|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these factors, the geographic region often plays a major role in voting behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, one's socioeconomic status is a reliable predictor of voting behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:8392|title = Voting behavior based on socioeconomic status|last = Brown|first = |date = 2009|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of these factors and influences compel researchers to reconsider the causes of political polarization.

=== Westernized focus ===
Much like many academic studies, political polarization scholars often are too narrowly focused within one nation and, thus, make broad generalizations regarding the concept from a national study. To have a better picture of the presence or absence of political polarization, scholars must consider widening the scope of their studies to the international contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Globalization's cultural consequences|last = Holton|first = |date = 2000|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization and culture: Global mélange.|last = Pieterse|first = |publisher = |year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15191">'''Relational art''' or '''relational aesthetics''' is a mode or tendency in [[fine art]] practice originally observed and highlighted by French art critic [[Nicolas Bourriaud]]. Bourriaud defined the approach as "a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space."&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas, ''Relational Aesthetics'' p.113&lt;/ref&gt; The artist can be more accurately viewed as the "catalyst" in relational art, rather than being at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Origin of the term==
{{Main article|Traffic (art exhibition)}}
One of the first attempts to analyze and categorize art from the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of relational art&lt;ref&gt;As a term, "relational art" has become accepted over "relational aesthetics" by the art world and Bourriaud himself as indicated by the 2002 exhibition ''Touch: Relational Art from the 1990s to Now'' at [[San Francisco Art Institute]], curated by Bourriaud.&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by Nicolas Bourriaud in 1998 in his book ''Esthétique relationnelle'' (''Relational Aesthetics'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in 1996, in the catalogue for the exhibition ''[[Traffic (art exhibition)|Traffic]]'' curated by Bourriaud at [[CAPC musée d'art contemporain de Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Bennett. "Public Relations: Nicolas Bourriaud Interview."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Traffic'' included the artists that Bourriaud would continue to refer to throughout the 1990s, such as [[Henry Bond]], [[Vanessa Beecroft]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster]], [[Liam Gillick]], Christine Hill, [[Carsten Höller]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[Miltos Manetas]], [[Jorge Pardo (artist)|Jorge Pardo]], [[Philippe Parreno]], and [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]]. The exhibition took its title and inspiration from Jacques Tati's film ''[[Trafic]]''(1971), in which Tati's protagonist is a Parisian automobile designer preparing a new model for an international auto show. In a ''denoument'' that became a fundamental relational aesthetics strategy, particularly for Tiravanija, Tati's entire film is about the designer's journey to the auto show at which he arrives just in time for the show to close.&lt;ref name="Bishop pp.54-55"&gt;Bishop, Claire. "Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics", pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas. ''Relational Aesthetics'', pp. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas. ''Traffic, Catalogue Capc Bordeaux'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mutualart.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mutualart.com/Article/TRAFFIC-CONTROL/FBC1A92B4838F138|title=TRAFFIC CONTROL|author=|date=|website=www.mutualart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Relational aesthetics''===
Bourriaud wishes to approach art in a way that ceases "to take shelter behind Sixties art history",&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud p.7&lt;/ref&gt; and instead seeks to offer different criteria by which to analyse the often opaque and open-ended works of art of the 1990s. To achieve this, Bourriaud imports the language of the 1990s [[internet]] boom, using terminology such as [[user-friendliness]], [[interactivity]] and [[DIY]] (do-it-yourself).&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2002 book ''Postproduction: Culture as Screenplay: How Art Reprograms the World'', Bourriaud describes ''Relational Aesthetics'' as works that take as their point of departure the changing mental space opened by the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas, Caroline Schneider and Jeanine Herman. ''Postproduction: Culture as Screenplay: How Art Reprograms the World'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relational Art===
Bourriaud explores the notion of relational aesthetics through examples of what he calls relational art. According to Bourriaud, relational art encompasses "a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space." The artwork creates a social environment in which people come together to participate in a shared activity. Bourriaud claims "the role of artworks is no longer to form imaginary and utopian realities, but to actually be ways of living and models of action within the existing real, whatever scale chosen by the artist."&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, ''Relational Aesthetics'' p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Stam, the head of new media and film studies at [[New York University]], coined a term for the shared activity group: witnessing publics. Witnessing publics are "that loose collection of individuals, constituted by and through the media, acting as observers of injustices that might otherwise go unreported or unanswered." The meaning of relational art is created when arts perception is altered while leaving the original artifact intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Keywords in Subversive Film / Media Aesthetics| last = Stam| first = Robert| publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]| year = 2015| isbn = 1118340612| location = |page = 282}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In relational art, the audience is envisaged as a community. Rather than the artwork being an encounter between a viewer and an object, relational art produces encounters between people. Through these encounters, meaning is elaborated ''collectively'', rather than in the space of individual consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Writer and director [[Ben Lewis (writer)|Ben Lewis]] has suggested that relational art is the new "ism", in analogue with "ism"s of earlier periods such as [[impressionism]], [[expressionism]] and [[cubism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/art-safari1.shtml |title=BBC iPlayer - BBC Four |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics", published in 2004 in ''[[October (journal)|October]]'', [[Claire Bishop]] describes the aesthetic of [[Palais de Tokyo]] as a "laboratory", the "curatorial modus operandi" of art produced in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop writes, "An effect of this insistent promotion of these ideas as artists-as-designer, function over contemplation, and open-endedness over aesthetic resolution is often ultimately to enhance the status of the curator, who gains credit for stage-managing the overall laboratory experience. As [[Hal Foster]] warned in the mid-1990s, 'the institution may overshadow the work that it otherwise highlights: it becomes the spectacle, it collects the cultural capital, and the director-curator becomes the star.'"&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop identifies Bourriaud's book as an important first step in identifying tendencies in the art of the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; but also writes in the same essay that such work “seems to derive from a creative misreading of [[poststructuralist]] theory: rather than the interpretations of a work of art being open to continual reassessment, the work of art itself is argued to be in perpetual flux.”&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop also asks, "if relational art produces human relations, then the next logical question to ask is what ''types'' of relations are being produced, for whom, and why?"&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; She continues that "the relations set up by relational aesthetics are not intrinsically [[democracy|democratic]], as Bourriaud suggests, since they rest too comfortably within an ideal of [[subjectivity]] as whole and of community as immanent togetherness."&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Traffic Control", published one year later in ''[[Artforum]]'', artist and critic Joe Scanlan goes one step further in ascribing to relational aesthetics a palpable peer pressure. Scanlan writes, "Firsthand experience has convinced me that relational aesthetics has more to do with peer pressure than collective action or egalitarianism, which would suggest that one of the best ways to control human behavior is to practice relational aesthetics."

==Exhibitions==
In 2002, Bourriaud curated an exhibition at the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], ''Touch: Relational Art from the 1990s to Now'', "an exploration of the interactive works of a new generation of artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.stretcher.org/archives/i1_a/2003_02_25_i1_archive.php |title=Features &amp;#124; Nicolas Bourriaud and Karen Moss |website=Stretcher.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibited artists included [[Angela Bulloch]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]], [[Jens Haaning]], [[Philippe Parreno]], [[Gillian Wearing]] and [[Andrea Zittel]]. Critic Chris Cobb suggests that Bourriaud's "snapshot" of 1990s art is a confirmation of the term (and idea) of relational art, while illustrating "different forms of social interaction as art that deal fundamentally with issues regarding public and private space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cobb |first=Chris |url=http://www.stretcher.org/archives/r3_a/2002_11_13_r3_archive.php |title=Features &amp;#124; Touch - Relational Art from the 1990’s to Now |website=Stretcher.org |date=2002-12-14 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Guggenheim Museum curator Nancy Spector organized an exhibition with most of the artists associated with Relational Aesthetics, but the term itself was shelved in favor of calling the show ''Theanyspacewhatever''. The exhibition included stalwarts Bulloch, Gillick, Gonzalez-Foerster, Höller, Huyghe, and Tiravanija, along with loosely affiliated artists Maurizio Cattelan, Douglas Gordon, Jorge Pardo, and Andrea Zittel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/anyspace/exhibition.html|title=theanyspacewhatever|author=|date=|website=web.guggenheim.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Robert Foster Cherry Award''' is a prize given biennially by [[Baylor University]] for "great teaching".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baylor Cherry Award |url=https://www.baylor.edu/cherry_awards/ |author=Baylor University|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Foster Cherry Award |url=https://www.fundsforngos.org/awards-and-prizes/robert-foster-cherry-award-winner-receive-prize-250000/ |author=Funds for NGOs|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cherry Award honors professors at the College or University level, in the English-speaking world, with established track records of teaching excellence and the ability to inspire students. Robert Foster Cherry, a graduate of [[Baylor University]] (A.B., 1929), made an estate bequest to establish the award. In a typical award cycle, three Finalists are selected based on nomination packages. The Finalists then compete for the award by giving a series of lectures at Baylor University. Each Finalist receives $15,000 and the ultimate award Recipient receives an additional $250,000 prize.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35494">'''Symbolic Convergence Theory''' ('''SCT''') is a [[communication theory]] developed by [[Ernest Bormann]] where people share common fantasies and these collections of individuals are transformed into a cohesive group. SCT offers an explanation for the appearance of a group's cohesiveness, consisting of shared emotions, motives, and meanings. Through SCT, individuals can build a community or a group consciousness which grows stronger if they share a cluster of fantasy themes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A First Look At Communication Theory|last=Griffin|first=Erin|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=39|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic convergence theory provides a description of the dynamic tendencies within systems of social interaction that cause communicative practices and forms to evolve. This theory allows theorists and practitioners to anticipate or predict what will happen and explain what did happen. One thing SCT does not do is allow for control of human communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bormann|first=Ernest|title=The Symbolic Convergence Theory of Communication: Applications and Implications for Teachers and Consultants|journal=Communication and Mass Media|date=4 April 1982|volume=10|issue=1|pages=1–2|url=http://sb6nw2tx4e.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=The+symbolic+convergence+theory+of+communication%3A+applications+and+implications&amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Applied+Communication+Research&amp;rft.au=Bormann%2C+E+G&amp;rft.date=1982-01-01&amp;rft.volume=10&amp;rft.issue=1&amp;rft.spage=50&amp;rft.epage=61&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=CAX0060020000272|accessdate=12-2-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to explain how communication can create and sustain group consciousness through the sharing of narratives or fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, Arin Rose. 2008. "Symbolic Convergence Theory". In Encyclopedia of Political Communication, Lynda Lee Kaid. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sagepolcom/symbolic_convergence_theory/0&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

To foster this cohesiveness, dramatizing or using fantasy stories are significant types of communication involved in SCT. SCT explains that meanings, emotions, values, and the motives for action are in the communication contexts by people trying to make sense out of a common experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Em|title=A First Look at Communication Theory|year=2012|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, NY|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It explores the human tendency of trying to understand events in terms of the people involved, who have certain personality traits and motivations, and have agency over how the events unfold.&lt;ref name="Bormann1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bormann|first=E. G.|title=Symbolic Convergence Theory and Communication in Group Decision Making|year=1996|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761904625|pages=81–113|editor=Randy Y. Hirokawa |editor2=[[Marshall Scott Poole]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCT was first proposed by [[Ernest Bormann]] in the ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bormann|first=E.G.|title=Fantasy and rhetorical vision: The rhetorical criticism of social reality|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|year=1972|volume=58|pages=396–407|doi=10.1080/00335637209383138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bormann and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota introduced SCT as a framework for discovering, describing, and explaining the dynamic process by which humans come to share symbolic reality.&lt;ref&gt;Olufowote, James O. 2006. "ROUSING AND REDIRECTING A SLEEPING GIANT: Symbolic Convergence Theory and Complexities in the Communicative Constitution of Collective Action." Management Communication Quarterly : McQ 19 (3): 451-492.&lt;/ref&gt; Bormann defines the basic communicative dynamic of symbolic convergence theory as, "the sharing of group fantasies which bring about symbolic convergence for the participants" (p.&amp;nbsp;4). It is a process through which collectives create and share a consciousness and develop a common symbolic reality.&lt;ref&gt;Endres, Thomas G. 1995. "Co-Existing Master Analogues in Symbolic Convergence Theory: The Knights of Columbus Quincentennial Campaign." Communication Studies 45 (3-4): 294. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/233195476&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic Convergence Theory is related to [[attribution theory]] in that it deals with the human tendency to attribute meaning to signs and objects in order to make sense of them.&lt;ref name="Bormann1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bormann|first=E.G.|title=The symbolic convergence theory of communication: Applications and implications for teachers and consultants|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|year=1982|volume=10|pages=50–61|doi=10.1080/00909888209365212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of symbolic convergence resembles empathic communication.&lt;ref name="Bormann1982" /&gt;

SCT has a three-part structure:
# elucidation of the recurring forms of communication involved in a shared group consciousness
# illustration of why group consciousness begins, rises, and is maintained
# explanation of the process of how an individual begins to share (or stops sharing) a common symbolic reality&lt;ref name="Bormann1982" /&gt;

== Plato's Allegory of the Cave ==
[[File:Plato's_Allegory_of_the_Cave_B+W_clear.jpg|alt=|border|right|413x413px]]Plato's classical Allegory of the Cave illustrates the creation of a shared perception in the manner of Symbolic Convergence Theory.  As show to the right, a group of prisoners are seated in a cave and can only see what is projected on the wall, they have no direct access to the reality the shadows represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plato%27s_Allegory_of_the_Cave_B+W_clear.jpg|title=JohnD'Alembert (2016-01-27), English: Plato's Allegory of the Cave, clear illustration in black and white, retrieved 2018-10-09|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikimedia Commons|archive-url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plato%27s_Allegory_of_the_Cave_B+W_clear.jpg|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11/19/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shadows become language symbols for the prisoners.  They may discuss what they see and form agreements on their perceptions. Their process of discussion and agreement on perceptions is Symbolic Convergence Theory in practice.  The prisoners can only create their perception of reality from the shadows cast of the wall, however they can not know if they are seeing the shadows of real objects, or distortions of reality, or illusions, or if anything has been omitted from their perceived reality.

===Basic concepts===

==== Fantasy themes ====

Unlike the traditional ideas of what [[fantasy]] means, Bormann uses the word to refer to "the creative and imaginative interpretation of events that fulfills a psychological or rhetorical need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A First Look At Communication Theory|last=Griffin|first=Em|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=38|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasy themes are used to construct a rhetorical vision or to dramatize messages embraced by the whole group. They are the means through which interpretation is accomplished through communication. SCT isn't concerned with finding truth, but the reaction from the group when these fantasies are shared.&lt;ref name="Jackson2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=B.G.|title=A Fantasy Theme Analysis of Peter Senge's Learning Organization|journal=Journal of Applied Behavioral Science|year=2000|volume=36|pages=193–209|doi=10.1177/002188630036200}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fantasy themes exist in the form of a word, a phrase, or a statement, which attempt to define past events,

Golden |editor2=G.F. Berquist |editor3=W.E. Coleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasy theme analysis is a humanistic method of rhetorical criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bormann|first=E.G.|title=Fantasy and rhetorical vision: Ten years later|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|year=1982|volume=68|pages=288–305|doi=10.1080/00335638209383614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantasy themes are broken down into the following three forms:&lt;ref name="Jackson2000" /&gt;
# ''Setting themes'' depicting where either the action takes place or where the characters act out their roles
# ''Character themes'' describing the agents or actors in the drama, assigning qualities and motives to them, implying that they have certain characteristics
#  ''Action themes'' or plot lines dealing with the action of the drama

==== Symbolic cues ====

A symbolic cue is a word, phrase, slogan, or a nonverbal sign or gesture that  works to trigger previously shared fantasies and emotions.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt; An example of a symbolic cue would be a bumper sticker, which actuates the observer into a larger shared reality.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt; Symbolic cues can also heighten a group's cohesiveness.

==== Fantasy types ====

A fantasy type is a fantasy theme that has currency across a large number of rhetorical visions. By providing known references, they help make sense out of a new phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt;

An example of a fantasy type would be when Richard Nixon was campaigning through his home state of California in 1952. A fund was put together by some wealthy Southern California businessman on behalf of Nixon. The newspapers picked this up and ran headlines such as "Secret Rich Men's Trust Fund Keeps Nixon in Style Far Beyond His Salary". The purpose of this fund was to help Nixon pay for expenses that he could not otherwise pay for out of his income. National newspapers were two to one in the favor of dropping Nixon from the ticket after this and his only hope was to find a way to regain public trust and support. Six days after the crisis, Nixon addressed the public by radio to respond to the charges against him. A fantasy theme emerging from this story would be Nixon presenting himself as the American dream. During his speech over the radio, he emphasized how he made his own way in the world and had to work for living. He also said, "How does a candidate pay for political expenses not covered by the government? First, is to be a rich man, which I am not. I feel that it is essential in this country of ours that a man of modest means can run for President." He offers autobiographical references which allow him to appear as the average man. This is an appropriate fantasy theme because it developed a response to the allegations that he is not a rich man who is getting money from everyone, but a hard working man who started from the ground and worked upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wells|first=William|title=Fantasy Theme Analysis of Nixon's "Checkers" Speech|journal=Electronic Journal of Communication|date=November 1996|volume=6|url=http://www.cios.org/EJCPUBLIC/006/1/00611.HTML|accessdate=11/9/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saga ====

A saga is the telling and re-telling of the accomplishments and events in the life of an individual, group, organization, or larger entity such as a nation.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt;  For instance, examples of American sagas include "the spirit of entrepreneurship" and "the power of the ballot box."&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt;   Symbolic convergence theorists argue that the Soviet Union had difficulty maintaining cohesion of the fifteen republics due to the weakening of the communist rhetorical vision and dwindling sagas.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt;

=== Structural concepts ===

==== Rhetorical vision ====

A rhetorical vision is a composite drama that unifies people in a common symbolic reality.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cragan|first=J.F.|author2=Shields, D.C. |title=The use of symbolic convergence theory in corporate strategic planning: A case study|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|date=May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rhetorical vision has five elements:

# ''Dramatis personae'' – the actors and players who give life to the rhetorical vision
# ''Plotline'' – provides the action of the rhetorical vision
# ''Scene'' – details the location of the rhetorical vision
# ''Sanctioning agent'' – legitimizes the rhetorical vision
# ''Master analogue'' – the reflection of a deeper structure within the rhetorical vision

=== Critical evaluation concepts ===

==== Shared group consciousness ====

A shared group consciousness must exist within a rhetorical community in order for a fantasy theme to chain out, a rhetorical vision to develop, a saga to exist, or a symbolic cue to imbue meaning.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt; Some terms that portray a shared group consciousness are a common ground, mutual understanding, created social reality, meeting of minds and empathic communication. Once a group has reached shared group consciousness, they no longer think in terms of "I" or "me" but in terms of "us" and "we." After all, communication is the drive that allows groups of people to move towards their goal. A shared group consciousness also reduces uncertainty by allowing groups to develop an identity that shapes their culture. By shaping their own culture, this can influence norms, roles and even decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beebe &amp; Masterson|title=Communicating in Small Groups|url=http://www.uky.edu/~drlane/groups/ch02.htm|accessdate=11/28/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rhetorical vision reality link ====

A rhetorical vision reality link allows for a viable rhetorical vision that chronicles an authentic account of the phenomena along with tangible evidence.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt; The lack of a rhetorical vision reality link, with no clear observational impressions of the facts, may lead to disprovable fantasies, characterized by rumor, innuendo, gossip, and even paranoia.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt;

==== Fantasy theme artistry ====

Fantasy theme artistry is the rhetorical ability to present situations in a form that appears attractive to people so that they will share them.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt; By presenting situations in a form that appears attractive to an audience, or showing that you have an understanding of the stories that group shares, you can speak to their stories and turn their opinions into your favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Symbolic Convergence Theory|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/symbolic_convergence.htm|publisher=Changing Minds|accessdate=11/9/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life cycle ==

=== Stage 1: Emergence or creation ===

A dramatic event or series of events leads to uncertainty and a need to develop rhetoric to explain the current state of reality. In the case of the [[Cold War]], the emergence of a fantasy-vision was necessary after Stalin's speech made clear his belief that capitalism and communism were incompatible and that war was inevitable. With the [[Truman Doctrine]] speech, emerging fantasies of Red Fascism (e.g., communism vs. democracy), Power Politics (e.g., containment strategy), and the Hot War vision (e.g., make the world safe for democracy), crystallized into the yet unknown concept of "the Cold War."&lt;ref name="ColdWar" /&gt;

=== Stage 2: Consciousness-raising ===
Fantasies begin to chain out among a collectivity of people over a common interest. As they co-create a new vision, their lives take on new meaning and emotion and
their behavior changes. The ''principle of critical mass'', when a rhetorical vision begins a period of rapid growth, is central to consciousness-raising. Also key to this stage is the ''principle of dedication'', which asserts that when planned events inspire individuals to act according to the key emotions present in the rhetorical vision their consciousness is raised.&lt;ref name="ColdWar" /&gt;

=== Stage 3: Consciousness-sustaining ===
At this stage, communication is focused on maintaining the commitment of people who have shared the rhetorical vision. The ''principle of shielding'' asserts that visions often remain fundamentally unchanged by containing motivation to quash counter messages.&lt;ref name ="ColdWar" /&gt; The ''principle of rededication'' asserts that visions may be sustained through severe criticism of counter-rhetoric and strategic positive dramatizations to maintain the visions vitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Jensen lectures: Contemporary communication studies|year=1983|publisher=Department of Communication, University of South Florida|location=Tampa, FL|pages=71–90|author=E.G. Bormann|authorlink=The symbolic convergence theory of communication and the creation, raising, and sustaining of public consciousness.|editor=J.I. Sisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''principle of reiteration'' asserts that rhetorical visions may be sustained by restating the key fantasy themes and types in new manners that fit within the dramatic structure of the vision, along with framing new information within the old rhetorical forms to maintain explanatory power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Applied communication research: A dramatistic approach|publisher=Waveland|location=Prospect Heights, IL|pages=79–91|author=Shields, D.C.|authorlink=Malcolm X's black unity addresses: Espousing middle-class fantasy themes as American as apple-pie.|editor1=J.F. Cragan |editor2=D.C. Shields }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stage 4: Vision-declining ===
Situations in a rhetorical community can change so rapidly that the vision cannot adapt successfully. The ''principle of explanatory deficiency'' assert that when a rhetorical vision loses its explanatory power, it begins to decline. Another possible reason for decline is explained by the ''principle of exploding free speech'', where a significant period of censorship is followed by a deluge of counter-rhetoric. Along similar lines, the ''principle of resurfacing competitive rhetorical visions'' asserts that with opened channels of communication, competition from alternate rhetorical visions increases.&lt;ref name="ColdWar" /&gt;

=== Stage 5: Terminus ===
The end of a rhetorical vision. The ''principle of rapid implosion'' asserts that an inflexible rhetorical vision will not decline incrementally, but will implode on itself when the combination of problems, inability to explain rapid change, and contradictory motives become too much for the vision to deal with.&lt;ref name="ColdWar" /&gt;

== Real world uses ==

Symbolic Convergence Theory has been used to study movements such as the [[Puritans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bormann|first=E.G.|title=The force of fantasy: restoring the American dream|year=2001|publisher=SIU Press|edition=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Knights of Columbus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Endres|first=T.G.|title=Coexisting master analogues in symbolic convergence theory: The knights of Columbus quincentennial campaign|journal=Communication Studies|volume=45|issue=3-4|pages=294–308|doi=10.1080/10510979409368430}}&lt;/ref&gt; American communism, and the [[Women's movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kroll|first=B.S.|title=From Small Group to Public View: Mainstreaming the Women's Movement.|journal=Communication Quarterly|year=1983|volume=31|series=2|pages=139–47|doi=10.1080/01463378309369497}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to study political visions such as the Cold War,&lt;ref name="ColdWar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bormann|first=Ernest G.|author2=Cragan, J.F. |author3=Shields, D.C. |title=An expansion of the rhetorical vision component of the symbolic convergence theory: The cold war paradigm case|journal=Communication Monographs|date=March 1996|volume=63|pages=1–28|doi=10.1080/03637759609376371}}&lt;/ref&gt; the New South,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell, III|first=J.

[[Cold War|The Cold War]] rhetorical vision allowed theorists to mesh findings of previous SCT studies to discern, understand, and explicate more fully the intricate life-cycle of a rhetorical vision. Therefore, one set of studies, written by Bormann and others recommended that rhetorical visions can encompass the gamut of shared consciousness from all parts of the political, social, artistic, military, economic and cultural spectrum. Basically, through this study on the Cold War, they see how unrelated rhetorical visions may be combined in to a masterful rhetorical vision providing rhetorical continuity over time.&lt;ref&gt;Bormann, Ernest G., and John F. Cragan. 1996. “An Expansion of the Rhetorical Vision Component of The Symbolic Convergence Theory: The Cold War Paradigm Case.” ''Communication Monographs'' 63 (1): 1.
&lt;/ref&gt;

SCT can also be applied in corporate [[strategic planning]] through guiding corporate [[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]], [[market segmentation]], and advertising and sales message testing. There are relevant cases&lt;ref&gt;Cragan, J. F., &amp; Shields, D. C. (1992). The use of symbolic convergence theory in corporate strategic planning: A case study. ''Journal of Applied Communication Research, 20''(2), 199-218. [[doi:10.1080/00909889209365329]]&lt;/ref&gt; consolidating the SCT theory-method-message complex combining with the strategic planning process and other implications.

== Criticism ==
Ernest G. Bormann, the theorist behind Symbolic Convergence Theory, a past professor of communication at University Minnesota, claimed that SCT is both objective and interpretive theory. The methods of determining fantasy themes, types, and visions create a humanistic approach that is interpretive.  SCT is often praised and even considered a bit unusual because it meets both criteria for being both objective and interpretive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Denise|title=Bormann's Symbolic Convergence Theory|url=http://www.colorado.edu/communication/meta-discourses/Papers/App_Papers/Young.htm|publisher=University of Colorado|accessdate=11/9/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ernest G. Bormann, John F. Cragan, &amp; Donald C. Shields responded to initial criticisms in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bormann|first=Ernest G.|last2=Cragan|first2=John F.|last3=Shields|first3=Donald C.|date=1994|title=Defense of Symbolic Convergence Theory: A look at the theory and its criticisms after two decades|url=|journal=Communication Theory|volume=4|pages=259-294|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bormann noted that one point that SCT lacks is to allow for predication and control of human communication in 1982.&lt;ref name="Bormann1982" /&gt;

Em Griffen puts forward arguments that Symbolic Convergence Theory is an objective theory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Symbolic Convergence Theory is objective because it focuses on sharing group fantasies that create symbolic convergence which is framed as a universal principle that holds true for all people regardless of the time, culture, and communication context. Below are four of the tests that can be interpreted for SCT on an objective side.

# A good objective theory explains what occurs and why it happens. This theory gives a great explanation of what makes sense to a group discussion and how. It can help us make sense of a chaotic group discussion when group members speak at one time or go off on verbal tangents.However, Boston College communication professor James Olufowote doesn't believe Bormann's explanation goes far enough. In a sympathetic critique aimed at making the theory better, he contends that "SCT does not sufficiently explain why humans are predisposed to dramatizing reality and sharing fantasy in the first place.&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Em|title=A First Look at Communication Theory|year=2012|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, NY|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although SCT covers most of this critique, Bormann says, "SCT does not sufficiently explain why humans are predisposed to dramatizing reality and sharing fantasy in the first place."&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;
# A good objective theory predict what's going to happen. SCT clearly achieves this portion of qualifying to be an objective theory. SCT can predict that when a fantasy chain erupts among members, symbolic convergence will occurs as well. Without this chain eruption, there will no be cohesiveness within the group. Although SCT can predict a fantasies will happen, it cannot predict when  dramatizing message will trigger a chain reaction. Bormann compared SCT as similar to Darwin's biological theory of evolution in that respect.The theory even suggests that without shared fantasies, there will be no cohesiveness. An evolutionary theory can explain the way modern humans evolved but cannot predict the further path of evolution. SCT involves a group consciousness through time and include a description of the dynamic forces that provide an explanation to discovered communication patterns but not when they will happen.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;
# A good interpretive theory clarifies people's values. SCT highlights the values of rhetorical community by creating a common ground, meeting of minds and empathic communication. This theory does not explain what happens when someone that is ignored is left out or excluded from the group because people don't mesh well when they are ignored.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;
# A good interpretive theory offers a new understanding of people. The SCT method does a great job of directing rhetorical critics to focus on symbolic language. Fantasy theme analyst focus on the rhetorical visions within varied communities such as a feminist critique looking for patterns of male dominance and how pro-eating disorder messages influence those in that community.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;

In 2003 Joshua Gunn delivered a sophisticated criticism of of what he considered Bormann's outdated conception of SCT involving a humanist construct of conscious human actors working with agency.  In contrast, Gunn proposed a post-modernist construct working in unconscious, and critiqued Bormann's work as a passing era prior to Michael McGee taking rhetorical study onto issues of ideology. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunn|first=Joshua|date=Feb 2003|title=Refiguring Fantasy: Imagination and Its Decline in U.S. Rhetorical Studies|url=|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=Vol. 89 Issue 1|pages=41-59|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bormann, Cragan, &amp; Shields responded the same year refuting or dismissing Gunn's criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bormann|first=Ernest|last2=Cragan|first2=John F.|last3=Shields|first3=Donald C.|date=2003|title=Defending symbolic convergence theory from an imaginary Gunn.|url=|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=89|pages=366-372|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A supporting argument that SCT is a measure of conscious human agency can be seen in the  intentional use of rhetoric to create a crafted convergence of a group's perceptions by a religious advocacy group in order to address a specific problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonald|first=Becky|date=1987|title=Falwell and Fantasy: The Rhetoric of a Religious and Political Movement (Moral Majority)|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303624782/|journal=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Why Symbolic Convergence Theory is useful ==
These stories, or fantasies, can help businesses, corporations or politicians guide the positive and negative feedback directly back to those in power. Because SCT is a [[General systems theory|general theory]] built on the method of [[natural sciences]], it can be applied to many different cultures and timelines.&lt;ref name=30years&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Gudykunst|editor-first=William B.|title=Communication Yearbook 25|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|pages=271–303|author=Bormann, E.G.|chapter=Three decades of developing, grounding, and using symbolic convergence theory (SCT)|author2=Cragan, J.F. |author3=Shields, D.C. |doi=10.1207/s15567419cy2501_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to account for the communicative processes, created by a group, used to foster the creation and sustenance of the group's so-called "consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bormann|first=E.G.|title=Symbolic Convergence Theory: A Communication Formulation|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1985|volume=35|issue=4|pages=128–138|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1985.tb02977.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are a few points of how and why SCT can be useful in everyday situations.

Determining communication malfunctions.
A question that happens a lot within SCT is, "Why do some fantasy themes spark a chain of sharing while other fail?" Groups fate as a part of a group have common experiences that predispose them to share fantasies which relate to their concerns. Therefore, these groups will have successful fantasy chains because they have more in common and are able to share more.  When issues of power, sexism, role conflict, social rejection and other touchy topics come into play, groups members often find the direct confrontation of such issues to be unsettling. These fantasy chains may begin, but often do not last very long.

Assessing communication efforts and persuasive campaigns.
This theory can provide insight within small groups, meetings, lectures and speeches, but it provides a greater use of assessing effects within the media. It is most heavily used within political campaigns. In the 1976 campaign, the investigators included the relationship between the media messages and the audience effects in their study. These studies analyzed the extent to which actual voting behavior can be anticipated by participation. By being able to predict the voting behaviors, political representatives could carefully craft their messages for different groups of people before giving their speeches and lectures to best benefit themselves.

The role of consciousness.
Within fantasy chains there are three phases that keep the chains going. They are consciousness creating, consciousness raising and consciousness sustaining. In the first phase, people to come to create a commonality among their group. If the groups shares this common fantasy, consciousness raising will often fall in line next. And lastly, the two first points combined will create a sustaining fantasy chain that will last.&lt;ref name=Bormann1982 /&gt;

== A Dangerous Phenomenon ==
An important element of Symbolic Convergence Theory is the propensity of the phenomenon it illustrates to be used against the public good.  Whether unintentionally or intentionally, SCT can be seen at work in revisionist history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History Wars|last=Engelhart|first=Tom|last2=Linenthal|first2=Edward|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=978-0805043877|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The intentional malevolent use of SCT principles against the public good can be seen in the rash of "Fake News" campaigns in which false perceptions are feed to society in order to create a false, but widely believed, consensus (convergence) of belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mueller|first=Alfred|date=Winter 2004|title=.).

== Similar Theories ==
'''[[Dramatism]]''' (Burke)

Dramatism is an attempt to understand the world through the construct of drama.  The Dramatism construct allows the analyst to give purpose to life by giving individuals agency as actors within the drama, ties events and locations into the perception of the world as a stage, and as all stories have a plot Dramatism gives existence and humanity purpose.  Dramatism provides groups of individuals conceptual tools on which to build a social convergent perception of reality.  

'''[[Social judgment theory|Social Judgement Theory]] ('''Sherif, Sherif and Hovland)

A self-persuasion theory defined by the perception and evaluation of an idea by comparing it with current attitudes. Persuasion occurs at the end of the process when a person understands a position and then compares the position it advocates to the other person’s position on the issue.  The closer the other person’s position comes to a person’s latitude of acceptance, that position will seem closer than it actually is

'''[[Social exchange theory|Social Exchange Theory]]''' (Thibaut and Kelley)

The major force in interpersonal relationships is the satisfaction of both people's self-interest. Self-interest is not necessarily bad and can actually enhance relationships. Interpersonal exchanges are analogous to economic exchanges where people are satisfied when they receive a fair return on their expenditures.

'''[[Social constructionism|Social Construction of Communication Technology]] ('''Fulk)

Communication technology use is influenced by workgroup attitudes and behaviors.  Social influence is greater when individuals are more attractive to their work group.

'''[http://www.vayne.com/fantasy_theme_analysis.htm Fantasy Theme Analysis]''' (Bormann)

This theory is a form of rhetorical criticism. It takes the shared fantasies of a group of people, perhaps the audience for a business presentation or a public speech, and examines them for inside jokes and other cues to a shared consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vayne.com/fantasy_theme_analysis.htm|title=What is Fantasy Theme Analysis?|last=Bormann|first=Ernest|date=|website=http://www.vayne.com/fantasy_theme_analysis.htm|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5551">'''Taiwanese literature''' refers to the literature written by [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] in any language ever used in Taiwan, including [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Taiwanese Hans|Taiwanese Han]] ([[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]], [[Hakka]] and [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]]) and [[Taiwanese Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] languages.

== Novels, short stories, and poetry ==
Taiwan has a very active literary scene, with a large number of writers of novels and (especially) short stories enjoying a wide readership, many of them for many decades running. A short selection of prominent writers and poets includes:

* [[Wu Zhuoliu]] (1900–1976)
* [[Bo Yang]] (1920-2008)
* [[Huang Chunming]] (1935-)
* [[Pai Hsien-yung]] (1937-)
* [[Chen Ruoxi]] (1938-)
* [[Wang Wenxing]] (1939-)
* [[Yang Mu]] (1940-)
* [[Sanmao (author)|San Mao]] (1943-1991)
* [[Lung Ying-tai]] (1952-)
* [[Qiu Fengjia]] (1864–1912)
* [[Loa Ho]] (1894-1943)
* [[John Ching Hsiung Wu]] (1899-1986)
* [[Chou Meng-tieh]] (1921-2014)
* [[William Marr]] (1936-)
* [[Li Kuei-Hsien]] (1937-)
* [[Wai-lim Yip]] (1937-)
* [[Xi Murong]] (1943-)
* [[Deng Feng-Zhou]] (1949-)
* [[Yang-Min Lin]] (1955-)
* [[Luo Yijun]] (1967-)
* [[Hou Wen-yong]] (1962-)

See the [[List of Taiwanese authors|full list of Taiwanese writers]].

Similarly, there is a large poetry community in Taiwan, and there have been several anthologies of Taiwanese poetry in English translation.

Two areas of cross-pollination between literature and other arts in Taiwan include modern dance (particularly the modern dance troupe [[Cloud Gate Dance Theater]], founded and directed by author [[Lin Hwai-min|Lin Huai-min]]) and filmmaking (including productions of stories by [[Huang Chunming]] directed by the leading Taiwanese filmmaker [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]]).

The 1990s saw the rise of a [[Taiwanese literature movement|nativist Taiwan literature movement]].

==Literature relating to politics==
With the establishment of the [[Communist]] regime in mainland China in 1949, books from mainland China were not often published in Taiwan and books from Taiwan were not often published in mainland China. In 1986, the first novel, ''Three Kings'', written by a mainland Chinese writer, [[Ah Cheng]], was openly published as such in Taiwan.

Some books from mainland China still found their way into Taiwan before 1986 by different ways. As pirate editions, under both a different title and a [[pseudonym]] for the author, under a different title, but with the author's name unchanged, under a pseudonym but with the title unchanged, or altered by changes in the text itself.

&lt;!--- ==History and Development of Taiwanese Literature== to be expanded ---&gt;

==Popular kinds of books==
Often books which have a movie based on them sell well in Taiwan. The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series are popular and so is ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. Some non-western popular books are ''[[The Hooligan Professor]]'', 流氓教授, by Lin Jian-long 林建隆, and ''[[Big Hospital Small Doctor]]'' 大醫院小醫師, by Hou Wun-yong 侯文詠. Both were adapted for television. Other popular non-literary works included books on mastering [[English language|English]] and attaining success.

==Literary awards==
The awards for Taiwanese literature include Taiwan Literature Award (presented by National Museum of Taiwan Literature), Wu San-Lien Literary Award (Wu San-Lien Award Foundation), Aboriginal Literature Award, and [[Min language|Min]]-[[Hakka language|Hakka]] Literary Award (both by the [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education of Taiwan]]).

'''''The Way''''' is the name of a [[fictional universe]] in a trilogy of [[science fiction]] [[novel]]s and one short story by [[Greg Bear]]. The first novel was ''[[Eon (novel)|Eon]]'' ([[1985 in literature|1985]]), followed by a sequel, ''[[Eternity (novel)|Eternity]]'' and a prequel, ''[[#Legacy|Legacy]]''. It also includes ''[[#The Way of All Ghosts|The Way of All Ghosts]]'', a short story that falls between ''Legacy'' and ''Eon''.

==Fictional History of the Thistledown==
Within the universe of ''The Way'', the Thistledown is an asteroid starship built by hollowing out [[3 Juno|Juno]] and fitting it with mass-driver (Rail gun) engines and thermonuclear drives. It is built 500 years in the future, as told in Bear's novel, ''Eon'', and is engaged on a multi-generational journey to Epsilon Eridani, around which a habitable planet is known to be circling.

The journey is meant to take 60 years, as the ship can only maintain a velocity of 20% the [[speed of light]]. Such velocities were rendered meaningless after the technology of the Thistledown was improved to include [[inertia damper|inertial dampeners]], allowing higher accelerations.

Inhabiting the Thistledown are the best and brightest of Earth, who are quite diverse both culturally and politically. The Thistledown's society includes one transcendent genius - Konrad Korzenowski, whose preference for living in the Thistledown as compared with an outer universe, causes him to experiment with closed-geodesic space time in the Seventh Chamber, 20 years into the Thistledown's voyage. The results of his experiments are shattering in the extreme - he creates a unique pocket universe: The Way.

==Origin of the Way: The Sixth Chamber==
The eponymous Way is an extension of the 7th Chamber, and was formed in the novels using the machinery of the 6th chamber. This machinery can best be described as a selective inertial damper, developed by engineers within the Thistledown with twofold purpose - to permit the Thistledown to accelerate to the limit of its engines (up to 99% the speed of light) and to selectively dampen inertia within the vessel, e.g. water within waterways, high velocity train systems. The inertial dampening machinery within the sixth chamber is anchored to the structure of the Thistledown, equally spaced around the chamber at the vertices of a regular [[heptagon]]. While selective and automatic, the ability of the machinery to selectively access inertial references within their field envelope is both remarkable as well as puzzling, since with this technology it would be possible to successfully begin construction of trans-luminal vessels, including the Thistledown itself. That the inhabitants did not is explained in the novels by the development of an extension of the selective inertial reference frame into a new 'pocket' universe: the Way.

==The Way==

===Mathematical Basis===
In the book series, the origins of The Way are the result of the superspace geometry researches of the fictional Dr. Patricia Luisa Vasquez in the late 20th and early 21st Century, pre- and post-''Death'' (''The Death'' being the name given to a nuclear war that occurred in the early 21st century within the timeline of the novels). Vasquez's first exploration into the superspace mathematics of fractional geometry and continua was her Doctoral Dissertation, ''Non-gravity Bent Geodesics of ''n''-Spatial Reference Frames: An Approach to Superspace Visualisation and Probability Clustering'' in 1989. This work was the fundamental basis of the Way, as it identifies the requirements for accessing superspaces, and the consequences of doing so within the context of a physical object linked to a stable quantum configuration: The Thistledown, connected to the Way.

Later work by Vasquez, specifically the fictional paper ''Theory of n-Spatial Geodesics as Applied to Newtonian Physics with a Special Discourse on ρ-Simplon World Lines.'' (''Post-Death Journal of Accepted Physics'', IOP Publishing, 2023) identifies the science behind the field technology used to build the selective inertial dampeners of the 6th chamber; The title also indicates the method whereby the folded Geodesics of 'anchored' space time within the Thistledown can be extended to access alternate world-lines, through the propagation of ρ-Simplon transforms of the in-folded geodesics accessed by selective field technology.

Thus, all of Vasquez' work leads directly to the application of physical technology to directly access superspace geometry.

===Creation of the Way===
At the creation, and rejoining of the Way to the Thistledown, the character Konrad Korzenowski and his Engineers designed and 'built' the way out of the in-folded Geodesics of the inertial dampening field of the Sixth Chamber machinery. This is described in the books by first considering the inertial dampening field: Within the Thistledown, the field envelops the asteroid, effectively isolating it from the Einsteinian Metrical Frame, permitting relative inertia to be ignored. The Thistledown was, at the time of activation, isolated from its continuum, but only selectively. Its matter and energy anchored it to its continuum and relative time, but its geometry and [[quantum entanglement]] had been strained by the inertial dampener, thus making it susceptible to superspace distortions, and therefore it could be affected by them negatively.

Korzenowski, having been taught by Vazquez on Earth, and in developing her work within the Thistledown, planned a radical extension of the inertial field of the sixth chamber - effectively extending the field away to an infinite extent within the seventh chamber. In order to do this effectively, he and his engineers modified a set of semi-sentient field calibration tools to build the first Clavicles. Unlike the field calibration tools from which they were descended, the Clavicles possessed the ability not only to manipulate the field, but extend it as an extension of the will of the operator. Already radical enough, Korzenowski and his team went further. By extending the field of the Sixth Chamber from within the Seventh Chamber of the Thistledown, they could then directly access what Vasquez had calculated within her own work - alternate world lines as non-gravity bent geodesics of superspace.

Korzenowski thus 'felt' superspace within the Seventh Chamber, selecting the infinite selection of possible alternate pocket universes accessible by the Clavicle to form, as a sheer act of will, the Way from his designs and his vision. The resulting structure was constructed, not of matter, but of previously in-folded superspace vectors now infinitely extended. (in the manner of [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild]] folded geometry, or of an [[asymptotic]] curve.) The Way was thus opened.

The Way's geometry also gave rise to the Flaw - as superspace geometry of the field boundary was extended infinitely, so the folded geodesics of the field unfold in the geometric centre of the Way to form a singularity. This singularity, the Flaw, rests within the Way's plasma tube (which in turn is sustained by the Flaw). The Flaw 'produces' gravity by actively repulsing matter away from itself in an acceleration at the square of the distance away from itself. In addition, any object encircling the Flaw, and then exerting pressure against it, experiences this pressure as a translation force along the Flaw's length perpendicular to the direction of force. The motion thus induced is controllable by the angle at which an annular ring enclosure is pressed against the Flaw. The same spatial transform also can be used to turn tip turbines in order to generate electricity. The Flaw permits a violation of the [[First Law of Thermodynamics]], therefore defining the Way as a perpetual motion machine of the First Order, making energy out of nothing.

===Early History of The Way===
The Way, as formed, was described by Bear as being in vacuum and did not consist of matter within its infinite length. Due to extremely slight ambiguity involved in its creation, the synchronicity between time within the Way, and within the Thistledown, was not exact. Thus, the Engineers spend two decades working to correct these faults using the Clavicles to manipulate the junction between Way and Thistledown. During this period, ambition led Korzenowksi to use the clavicle to open the first exploratory gate within the way, leading to the universe of the Jarts. Though the gate to Jart world was closed, the advanced Jarts nevertheless successfully managed to re-open, expand, occupy, and even master the workings of the Way. Korzenowski on returning had not taken into account the time dilation effects within the Way, and the Jarts had centuries within the way to access alternate universes, such as the one to the world of the Talsit. They established a trading empire, and were very hostile to the Way's human creators who re-entered their territories having stabilised the connection to the Thistledown.

===The Jart Wars===
The progressive Geshels and conservative Naderites (two fictional groups in the novels) who made their travels into the Way quickly met the Jarts. Conflict ensued in order to drive the Jarts out of the Way - this partly succeeded within the first century of Human expansion into the Way. Both sides fought each other through the use of remote slaved munitions carrier vehicles, of broadly similar design (a consequence of their shared environment). Human vehicles were 'manned' by partial personalities held within memory systems. Jart machines had similar arrangements, though in at least one documented case, one of the war machines was manned by a corporeal Jart duty expediter, subsequently captured.

Ultimately, the Jarts were driven back beyond 2 ex 9 ( 2x10^9&amp;nbsp;km, or 2 billion kilometres), a position they remained at until Journey Year 1174.

At the conclusion of the Jart Wars at about Journey Year 850, the Geshels and Naderites moved into the Way. The conflict had however resulted in casualties on both sides, and one of the most significant was that of the Engineer, Korzenowski, assassinated by Orthodox Naderites in the Thistledown. His personality was not completely lost, but no complete backups of the Engineer existed until the events of Journey Year 1175.

===Early Human exploration of the Way===
The opening of gates and use of field technology permitted the Geshels to cover the Way with soil and living plants, as well as fill it with air, for nearly a lightyear down from the Thistledown. This magnificent area remained as wilderness for much of the life of the Way. Soil, air and water were brought from worlds accessed from within the Way. Quickly, the gate openers discovered that the epoch and origin of the Thistledown within Earth's solar system defined where the gates opened to - almost without exception (and these exceptions included as a consequence of the infinities addressed through superspace geometries as defined by Patricia Vasquez) were alternative versions of Earth within other Universes. Thus commerce was possible with these universes. Covering the surface of the way and filling the way with air was rendered simple by opening gates in proximity to a planet not occupied by intelligence or excessive quantities of animals, and then sucking the air and soil from these worlds to cover the Way's bare surface.

Gates are capped with cupolas formed from Space-time itself. As distortions in space-time geometry, their nature can be calculated by 21st century instruments laid on their 'surfaces'. The constant Pi, in particular, is most strongly affected.

===The maturing Axis City, and the Eviction of the Naderites from the Thistledown===
With the opening (and re-opening of previously Jart controlled) gates, the human migrants gained access to remarkable technologies and abilities, and made possible habitation within the Way, and on the Flaw itself, in the newly created Axis Thoreau and Axis Euclid at 1.5 ex 7 (15 million km). They developed trading client-patron relations with the Frants of Timbl, and client-client relations with the Talsit. With development of memory technologies, City Memory was created, and humans not only became immortal, but also gained the ability to be reborn. Government changed, with the formation of the Hexamon and the governing Nexus.

Orthodox Naderites remained within the Thistledown for a century after the end of Jart Wars, but concerns over the safety of the Thistledown and the danger of interference with the Sixth Chamber machinery caused the Geshels to have the Naderites forcibly removed from Thistledown to prevent disaster. Violence erupted during the forced migration, and for acclimation of Naderites, forced occupation of Thistledown City (the Geshel enclave) for most Naderites took place for one year.

By Journey Year 950, the Thistledown was empty, and history proceeded gently until the cataclysmic events of Journey Year 1175.

===The Geometric Rhythms===
The mathematical construction of the way as written creates a rhythm, or order in which gate loci are located, a consequence of the propagation of World Lines along folded Geodesics. For every kilometer of the Way, time moves back by a year. For every meter of the Way there is a minimum intersection with the world-lines of 100 universes. However, there are significant segments of the Way wherein there are a near-infinity of Universes containing alternate Earths.

The reason for the Geometry Stacks, as they are called, is described by the author as being a direct consequence of the origin of the Way within the Thistledown, and its development through extension of the inertial dampening field of the Sixth Chamber. Essentially, the Way is anchored to the space-time of the Thistledown—Juno, within the Solar System of Earth. If it were possible to construct a universe like the Way without [[quantum entanglement]], the Geometry Stacks would most likely not exist, or if in existence, would not be tied to a quantum entanglement with a particular continuum. Since the Way and Thistledown are entangled, the existence of the Geometry Stacks is to be expected within mathematical theory first developed by Patricia Vasquez in 1989 with regard to folded spatial transforms expressed as a function of the superspace curvature of the Way.

There is a sharp consequence to the entanglement of the Way - Alternate Universes accessed by Gates, and to worlds such as that of the Frants (Timbl), Talsit and Jarts, ''must'' by definition share a certain amount of entanglement, even in a most fractional percentage. It is therefore fair to say that these worlds are in fact alternates universes and versions of Earth, though divergence and near-complete lack of similarity in fact make them very different indeed.

The most noteworthy aspect of the Geometry Stacks is their infinite profusion of alternate Earths, in far greater quantity in comparison with the commerce gates with partners, clients—and enemies. In the case of the world of the Talsit, more than one Gate at more than one location is possible, as the probability of the Talsit world is very well defined indeed. Therefore, it can be demonstrated with mathematical precision that Human beings impose a remarkable set of quantum stresses upon their home continuum, resulting in a near-infinity of timelines for their world—all equally real. Thus, the many-worlds quantum model is proved to be both real and accessible within the novels, a fantastic achievement.

Gate openers, by Journey Year 1174, prefer not to work within the Geometry Stacks, as these universes are considered not worth the effort of determination, given the extreme difficulty of tuning a gate in the very tight confines of Stacks, where Universes are often separated by sub-quantum distances.

The Way, inevitably, will intersect with itself, and with the cores of Stars. Remarkable events are derived from this fact. In addition, the Way encompasses all events within itself within its length.

== The three novels ==

===''Eon''===
[[Image:Eon Book Cover.jpg|thumbnail|200px|The cover art of ''Eon'']]
{{Main|Eon (novel)}}

''Eon'' chronicles the appearance and discovery of the ''Thistledown'', and its subsequent effect on humanity.

In the early 21st century, the United States and Russia are on the verge of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. In that tense political climate, an [[asteroid]] appears out of near space after an unusual supernova and settles into an extremely elliptical near Earth orbit. The two nations each try to claim this mysterious object, which appears to be a virtual duplicate of [[3 Juno|Juno]]. It is hollow and contains seven vast [[terraforming|terraformed]] chambers. Two of the chambers contain cities long abandoned by human beings who seemed to come from Earth's future. The asteroid is called the ''Thistledown'' by its builders. A startling discovery is that it is bigger inside than outside. The seventh chamber appears to stretch into infinity.

The human inhabitants of the Thistledown come from an alternate timeline, approximately 1000 years in the future. In their timeline, human civilization was nearly destroyed by the "Death", a calamitous World War involving [[nuclear weapon]]s. The Death occurred at approximately the same time as the appearance of the Thistledown in the present time. Its presence threatens to cause the Death to occur on the current timeline as well.

An expedition is sent down the seemingly infinite seventh chamber (The "Way", as it is known) where it encounters the descendants of humanity. The high technology of this civilization, known as the ''Hexamon'', with its control over [[genetic engineering]], human augmentation, and matter itself are some of the main points of interest here. The Hexamon includes several alien species who have come to live with humanity's descendants. The Hexamon itself is at war with an alien race known as the ''Jarts'' from further down the corridor still.

In 2007, [[Ballistic Publishing|CGSociety]] organised a "CG Challenge" based upon ''Eon''&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=3987 CG Challenge XX - Eon]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Eternity''===
{{Main|Eternity (novel)}}

[[Jart (fiction)|Jarts]], politics, and technology make up the second book in the series: ''Eternity''.

The Jart religion is particularly interesting because it is based on the preservation of all data, which encompasses all life forms, past and present, and sending that data to the Jarts' future masters, their descendants.

===''Legacy''===
In the third book (a [[prequel]], set in the time before ''Eon''), ''Legacy'', soldier [[Olmy ap Sennon]] is sent to spy on a group of dissidents who have used the spacetime tunnel of "the Way" (introduced in ''Eon'') to colonize the alien world of '''Lamarckia''', a planet with an ecosystem that learns from its changed environment in a way that resembles [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian evolution]]. Its plants and animals turn out to actually be parts of continent-sized organisms.

===''The Way of All Ghosts''===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
In the short story, ''The Way of All Ghosts'', soldier Olmy ap Sennon is sent to close a lesion that formed out of a wayward gate into perfection. This story was published in 1999 in ''[[Far Horizons]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3039">The {{nihongo|'''Tomica Hero Series'''|トミカヒーローシリーズ|Tomika Hīrō Shirīzu}} was a short-lived series of [[Japan]]ese [[tokusatsu]] [[children's television|children's]] [[Japanese television drama|television drama]]s. Based on [[Takara Tomy]]'s [[Tomica]] [[toy car]] line, the series air on [[TV Aichi]] and [[TV Tokyo]] before being [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] around Japan. Takara Tomy previously produced ''[[Madan Senki Ryukendo]]'',&lt;ref name="staff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-aichi.co.jp/rescue-force/staff/staff.html|title=レスキューフォース_テレビ愛知|accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Ryukendo'' was not based on a pre-existing set of toys for the company. However, it made reference to the Earth Federation which the UFDA is a branch of, its main cast making a cameo in the ''Rescue Force'' movie. Although airing on different days, the Tomica Hero Series served as competition to [[TV Asahi]] and [[Toei Company]]'s [[Super Sentai]] and [[Kamen Rider Series]] and [[Tsuburaya Productions]]' [[Ultra Series]]. Only two series were made with the Tomica Hero story, which concluded with a stage show featuring members of the ''Rescue Force'' cast.

==List of series==
* {{nihongo|''[[Tomica Hero: Rescue Force]]''|トミカヒーロー　レスキューフォース|Tomika Hīrō Resukyū Fōsu}}: Airing from April 2008 to April 2009, the series featured a team of [[emergency service]] workers saving Japan from an organization trying to cause mayhem with artificial crises, as well as saving citizens from [[natural disaster]]s. ''Rescue Force'' also had a film subtitled {{nihongo|''Rescue the Mach Train!''|マッハトレインをレスキューせよ！|Mahha Torein o Resukyū seyo!}}, which the main cast of Ryukendo made a cameo in. The show's theme deals with "Rescue Soul", a term used in the series to describe what a rescuer stands for.
* {{nihongo|''[[Tomica Hero: Rescue Fire]]''|トミカヒーロー　レスキューファイアー|Tomika Hīrō Resukyū Faiā}}: Airing from April 4, 2009 to March 27, 2010 and a continuation of the first, ''Rescue Fire'' focuses on another group of emergency service workers who are solely [[firefighter]]s, with its theme dealing with the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|value of life]]. The series also continues the plot device of the villains acting for the planet's sake. The series' opening [[music in Japanese animation|theme song]]s are performed by ''anison'' [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[JAM Project]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2776">The '''Youth Citizenship Commission''' (YCC) was a commission created in the [[United Kingdom]] to promote youth participation in the political process and to foster youth education in [[citizenship]], in response to the July 2007 publication of the 'Governance of Britain' [[Green Paper]], which pointed out such needs. The thirteen independent Commissioners, headed by chair Professor [[Jonathan Tonge]], oversaw the commission. Among the commissioners were three youth participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthcitizenshipcommission.co.uk/members/ Members] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518115857/http://www.youthcitizenshipcommission.co.uk/members/ |date=May 18, 2014 }}. YCC website, accessed 18 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The YCC focused its attention on individuals between the ages of 11 and 19. In addition to its work with the general youth population, it also focused on developing healthy concepts of citizenship among [[disadvantaged]] populations. It advocated [[volunteerism]] as a means of [[youth engagement]] and explored questions of how the government can be more responsive to youth needs. It considered lowering the voting age to 16. The YCC made its final report in spring 2009 to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], the [[Secretary of State for Justice]] and the [[Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthcitizenshipcommission.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/YCC_Final_Report1.pdf Final Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518120847/http://www.youthcitizenshipcommission.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/YCC_Final_Report1.pdf |date=May 18, 2014 }}, YCC website, accessed 18 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This included sixteen recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthcitizenshipcommission.co.uk/ycc-recommendations/ Recommendations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518120447/http://www.youthcitizenshipcommission.co.uk/ycc-recommendations/ |date=May 18, 2014 }}, YCC website, accessed 18 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
