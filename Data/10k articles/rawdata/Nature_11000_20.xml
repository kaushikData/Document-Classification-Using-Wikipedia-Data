      <comment>/* Accidental release of pressurized gas */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18057">'''Accidental release source terms''' are the mathematical equations that quantify the flow rate at which accidental releases of liquid or gaseous  [[pollutant]]s into the ambient [[Natural environment|environment]] can occur at industrial facilities such as [[Oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[petrochemical]] plants, [[natural gas]] processing plants, oil and gas  transportation [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], chemical plants, and many other industrial activities. Governmental regulations in many countries require that the probability of such accidental releases be analyzed and their quantitative impact upon the environment and human health be determined so that mitigating steps can be planned and implemented. 

There are a number of mathematical calculation methods for determining the flow rate at which gaseous and liquid pollutants might be released from various types of accidents. Such calculational methods are referred to as ''source terms'', and this article on accidental release source terms explains some of the calculation methods used for determining the [[mass flow rate]] at which gaseous pollutants may be accidentally released.

==Accidental release of pressurized gas==
When gas stored under [[pressure]] in a closed vessel is discharged to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] through a hole or other opening, the gas [[velocity]] through that opening may be choked (i.e., it has attained a maximum) or it may be non-choked.

Choked velocity, also referred to as sonic velocity, occurs when the ratio of the absolute source pressure to the absolute downstream pressure is equal to or greater than '''[(''k'' + 1) / 2]&lt;sup&gt;''k'' / (''k'' − 1)&lt;/sup&gt;''', where ''k'' is the [[heat capacity ratio|specific heat ratio]] of the discharged gas (sometimes called the [[adiabatic index|isentropic expansion factor]] and sometimes denoted as &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;).

For many gases, ''k'' ranges from about 1.09 to about 1.41, and therefore '''[(''k'' + 1) / 2]&lt;sup&gt;''k'' / (''k'' − 1 )&lt;/sup&gt;''' ranges from 1.7 to about 1.9, which means that choked velocity usually occurs when the absolute source vessel pressure is at least 1.7 to 1.9 times as high as the absolute downstream ambient atmospheric pressure.

When the gas velocity is choked, the equation for the [[mass flow rate]] in SI metric units is:&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]'', Sixth Edition, McGraw-Hill Co., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hazards&gt;''Handbook of Chemical Hazard Analysis Procedures'', Appendix B, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1989.

: &lt;math&gt;Q \;=\; C\;A\; \sqrt{\;k\;\rho\;P\; \left(\frac{2}{k+ 1}\right)^\frac{k + 1}{k - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

or this equivalent form:

: &lt;math&gt;Q \;=\; C\;A\;P\;\sqrt{\left(\frac{\;\,k\;M}{Z\;R\;T}\right)\left(\frac{2}{k + 1}\right)^\frac{k + 1}{k - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

For the above equations, '''it is important to note that although the gas velocity reaches a maximum and becomes choked, the mass flow rate is not choked'''. The mass flow rate can still be increased if the source pressure is increased.

Whenever the ratio of the absolute source pressure to the absolute downstream ambient pressure is less than 
'''[ (''k'' + 1) / 2]&lt;sup&gt;''k'' / (''k'' − 1)&lt;/sup&gt;''', then the gas velocity is non-choked (i.e., sub-sonic) and the equation for mass flow rate is:

: &lt;math&gt;Q \;=\; C\;A\;\sqrt{\;2\;\rho\;P\;\left[\frac{k}{k - 1}\right]\left[\left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{2}{k}-\;\,\left(\frac{\;P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{k + 1}{k}\;\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

or this equivalent form:

: &lt;math&gt;Q \;=\; C\;A\;P\; \sqrt{\left[\frac{2\;M}{Z\;R\;T}\right]\left[\frac{k}{k - 1}\right]\left[\,\left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{2}{k} -\;\,\left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{k + 1}{k}\;\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

The above equations calculate the '''initial instantaneous''' mass flow rate for the pressure and temperature existing in the source vessel when a release first occurs. The initial instantaneous flow rate from a leak in a pressurized gas system or vessel is much higher than the average flow rate during the overall release period because the pressure and flow rate decrease with time as the system or vessel empties. Calculating the flow rate versus time since the initiation of the leak is much more complicated, but more accurate. Two equivalent methods for performing such calculations are presented and compared at [http://www.air-dispersion.com/feature2.html www.air-dispersion.com/feature2.html].

The technical literature can be very confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the universal gas law constant ''R'' which applies to any [[ideal gas]] or whether they are using the gas law constant ''R''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; which only applies to a specific individual gas.  The relationship between the two constants is ''R''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''/''M''.

Notes:
* The above equations are for a real gas.
* For an ideal gas, '''''Z''''' = 1 and '''''ρ''''' is the ideal gas density.
* 1{{nbsp}}kilomole (kmol) = 1000{{nbsp}}[[mole (unit)|moles]] = 1000 gram-moles = kilogram-mole.

===Ramskill's equation for non-choked mass flow===

P.K. Ramskill's equation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.che.utexas.edu/cache/newsletters/Spr_99.pdf CACHE Newsletter No.48, Spring 1999] Gierer, C. and Hyatt, N.,''Using Source Term Analysis Software for Calculating Fluid Flow Release Rates'' Dyadem International Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramskill, P.K. (1986), ''Discharge Rate Calculation Methods for Use In Plant Safety Assessments'', Safety and Reliability Directory, United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority&lt;/ref&gt;  for the non-choked flow of an ideal gas is shown below as equation (1):

: (1) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;Q = C \;\rho_A\;A\;\sqrt{\frac{\;\,2\;P}{\rho} \cdot \frac{k}{k-1} \cdot \left[\; 1 - {\left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{k - 1}{k}}\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

The gas density, '''''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''', in Ramskill's equation is the ideal gas density at the downstream  conditions of temperature and pressure and it is defined in equation (2) using the [[ideal gas law]]: 

: (2) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\rho_A = \frac{M\;P_A}{R \;T_A}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the downstream temperature '''''T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is not known, the isentropic expansion equation below &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/compexp.html Isentropic Compression or Expansion]&lt;/ref&gt; is used to determine '''''T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''' in terms of the known upstream temperature '''''T''''': 

: (3) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\frac{T_A}{T} = \left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{k - 1}{k}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining equations (2) and (3) results in equation (4) which defines '''''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''' in terms of the known upstream temperature '''''T''''':

: (4) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\rho_A = \frac{M \;P^\frac{k - 1}{k}}{R \;T \;P_A^{-\frac{1}{k}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using equation (4) with Ramskill's equation (1) to determine non-choked mass flow rates for ideal gases gives identical results to the results obtained using the non-choked flow equation presented in the previous section above.

==Evaporation of non-boiling liquid pool==
Three different methods of calculating the rate of evaporation from a non-boiling liquid pool are presented in this section. The results obtained by the three methods are somewhat different.

===The U.S. Air Force method===
The following equations are for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of liquid which is at or near the ambient temperature. The equations were derived from field tests performed by the U.S. Air Force with pools of liquid hydrazine. &lt;ref name=Hazards/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E = \left(4.161 \times 10^{-5}\right) \cdot u^{0.75} \cdot T_F \cdot M \cdot \frac{P_S}{P_H}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
| align=right |where:
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
! align=right | ''E''
| align=left  | = evaporation flux, kg/m²·min of pool surface
|-
! align=right | ''u''
| align=left  | = windspeed just above the liquid surface, m/s
|-
! align=right | ''T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
| align=left  | = absolute ambient temperature, K
|-
! align=right | ''T&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
| align=left  | = pool liquid temperature correction factor, dimensionless
|-
! align=right | ''T&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;''
| align=left  | = pool liquid temperature, °C
|-
! align=right | ''M'' 
| align=left  | = pool liquid molecular weight, dimensionless
|-
! align=right | ''P&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
| align=left  | = pool liquid vapor pressure at ambient temperature, [[mmHg]]
|-
! align=right | ''P&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
| align=left  | = hydrazine vapor pressure at ambient temperature, mmHg (see equation below)
|}

'''If ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = 0{{nbsp}}°C or less, then ''T''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1.0'''

'''If ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0{{nbsp}}°C, then ''T''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1.0&amp;nbsp;+ 0.0043 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''

: &lt;math&gt;P_H = 760 \cdot e^{65.3319 - \frac{7245.2}{T_A} - 8.22\;\ln\left(T_a\right) + 0.0061557\;T_A}&lt;/math&gt;

| align=left  | = 2.7183, the base of the natural logarithm system
|-
| align=right | &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt;
| align=left  | = natural logarithm
|}

===The U.S. EPA method===
The following equations are for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of liquid which is at or near the ambient temperature. The equations were developed by the United States [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] using units which were a mixture of metric usage and United States usage.&lt;ref name=Risk/&gt; The non-metric units have been converted to metric units for this presentation.

: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{0.1288 \cdot A \cdot P \cdot M^{0.667} \cdot u^{0.78}}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

NB, the constant used here is 0.284 from the mixed unit formula/2.205{{nbsp}}lb/kg.  The 82.05 become 1.0 = (ft/m)² × mmHg/kPa.

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
| align=right | where:
| &amp;nbsp;

| align=left  | = evaporation rate, kg/min
|-

| align=left  | = pool liquid molecular weight, dimensionless 
|-
! align=right | ''A''
| align=left  | = surface area of the pool liquid, m²
|-
! align=right | ''P'' 
| align=left  | = vapor pressure of the pool liquid at the pool temperature, kPa
|-
! align=right | ''T'' 
| align=left  | = pool liquid absolute temperature, K
|}

The U.S. EPA also defined the pool depth as 0.01{{nbsp}}m (i.e., 1{{nbsp}}cm) so that the surface area of the pool liquid could be calculated as:

:'''''A''''' = (pool volume, in m³)/(0.01)

Notes:
* 1{{nbsp}}kPa = 0.0102{{nbsp}}[[kgf]]/cm² = 0.01{{nbsp}}bar
* mol = [[mole (unit)|mole]]
* atm = atmosphere

===Stiver and Mackay's method===
The following equations are for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of liquid which is at or near the ambient temperature. The equations were developed by Warren Stiver and Dennis Mackay of the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Toronto. &lt;ref name=Stiver&gt;Stiver, W. and Mackay, D., ''A Spill Hazard Ranking System For Chemicals'', Environment Canada First Technical Spills Seminar, Toronto, Canada, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

==Evaporation of boiling cold liquid pool==
The following equation is for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of cold liquid (i.e., at a liquid temperature of about 0{{nbsp}}°C or less).&lt;ref name=Hazards/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E = 0.0001\;M (7.7026 - 0.0288\;B)\; e^{-(0.0077\;B) - 0.1376}&lt;/math&gt;

==Adiabatic flash of liquefied gas release==
Liquefied gases such as ammonia or chlorine are often stored in cylinders or vessels at ambient temperatures and pressures well above atmospheric pressure. When such a liquefied gas is released into the ambient atmosphere, the resultant reduction of pressure causes some of the liquefied gas to vaporize immediately. This is known as [[flash evaporation|"adiabatic flashing"]] and the following equation, derived from a simple heat balance, is used to predict how much of the liquefied gas is vaporized. 

: &lt;math&gt;X = 100\;\frac{H_s^L - H_a^L}{H_a^V - H_a^L}&lt;/math&gt;

If the enthalpy data required for the above equation is unavailable, then the following equation may be used.

These storms form in environments where at least some amount of [[Convective Available Potential Energy]] (CAPE) is present, but very low levels of [[wind shear]] and [[Helicity (fluid mechanics)|helicity]].  The lifting source, which is a crucial factor in thunderstorm development, is usually the result of uneven heating of the surface, though they can be induced by [[weather front]]s and other low-level boundaries associated with wind [[Convergence zone|convergence]].  The energy needed for these storms to form comes in the form of [[insolation]], or solar radiation.  Air-mass thunderstorms do not move quickly, last no longer than an hour, and have the threats of [[lightning]], as well as showery light, moderate, or heavy rainfall.  Heavy rainfall can interfere with [[microwave]] transmissions within the atmosphere.  

Lightning characteristics are related to characteristics of the parent thunderstorm, and could induce [[wildfire]]s near thunderstorms with minimal rainfall.  On unusual occasions there could be a weak [[downburst]] and small [[hail]].  They are common in temperate zones during a summer afternoon.  Like all thunderstorms, the mean-layered wind field the storms form within determine motion.  When the deep-layered wind flow is light, [[outflow boundary]] progression will determine storm movement.  Since thunderstorms can be a hazard to aviation, pilots are advised to fly above any haze layers within regions of better visibility and to avoid flying under the anvil of these thunderstorms, which can be regions where hail falls from the parent thunderstorm.  Vertical [[wind shear]] is also a hazard near the base of thunderstorms which have generated [[outflow boundary|outflow boundaries]].

==Life cycle==
[[File:Thunderstorm formation.jpg|thumb|400px|Stages of a thunderstorm's life]]
The trigger for the lift of the initial cumulus cloud can be [[insolation]] heating the ground producing [[thermals]], areas where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture rapidly cools into liquid drops of water due to the cooler temperatures at high altitude, which appears as ''[[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]]'' clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, [[latent heat]] is released which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding dry air. The air tends to rise in an ''updraft'' through the process of [[convection]] (hence the term [[Precipitation (meteorology)|convective precipitation]]). This creates a [[low pressure area|low-pressure zone]] beneath the forming thunderstorm, otherwise known as a [[cumulonimbus cloud]]. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [[kilograms|kg]] of water vapor is lifted into the [[Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="condensationenergy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.syr.edu/courses/modules/ENERGY/ENERGY_POLICY/tables.html |title=Rough Values of Various Processes |author=Gianfranco Vidali |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-08-31 |publisher=[[University of Syracuse]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315113421/http://physics.syr.edu/courses/modules/ENERGY/ENERGY_POLICY/tables.html |archivedate=2010-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As they form in areas of minimal vertical [[wind shear]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/MET/Faculty/businger/notes/25AirmassTstorm.pdf|title=Lecture 25 Air Mass Thunderstorms and Lightning|author =Steven Businger|publisher=[[University of Hawai'i]]|date=2006-11-17|accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the thunderstorm's rainfall creates a moist and relatively cool outflow boundary with undercuts the storm's low level inflow, and quickly causes dissipation.  [[Waterspout]]s, small hail, and strong wind gusts can occur in association with these thunderstorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oh8lqM5obuYC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=air+mass+thunderstorm#v=onepage&amp;q=air%20mass%20thunderstorm&amp;f=false|title=A world of weather: fundamentals of meteorology: a text/ laboratory manual|author1=Lee M.

==Common locations of appearance==
Also known as single cell thunderstorms, these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales. They also occur in the cool unstable air which often follows the passage of a [[weather fronts|cold front]] from the sea during winter. Within a cluster of thunderstorms, the term "cell" refers to each separate principal updraft. Thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation, as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary which sets up new thunderstorm development. Such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability; hence the term "air mass thunderstorm". When such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them, it is known as a pulse severe storm. Pulse severe storms are poorly organized due to the minimal vertical wind shear in the storm's environment and occur randomly in time and space, making them difficult to forecast. Between formation and dissipation, single cell thunderstorms normally last 20–30&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="tsbasics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tstorm/tst_basics.html|title=A Severe Weather Primer: Questions and Answers about THUNDERSTORMS |author =National Severe Storms Laboratory| publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2006-10-15|accessdate=2009-09-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090825000832/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tstorm/tst_basics.html| archivedate= 25 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motion==
[[File:Anvil shaped cumulus panorama edit crop.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Anvil shaped thundercloud in the mature stage over [[Swifts Creek, Victoria]]]]
The two major ways thunderstorms move are via advection of the wind and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture. Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth's [[troposphere]], or the lowest {{convert|8|km|mi}} of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Younger thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than more mature thunderstorms as they tend not to be as tall.  If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, moves ahead of the thunderstorm, the thunderstorm's motion will move in tandem with the gust front. This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation (HP), such as air-mass thunderstorms.  When thunderstorms merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion.  On [[weather radar]], storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.&lt;ref name="motion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/unr/soo/scm/ZB06.pdf|title=Operational Forecasting of Supercell Motion: Review and Case Studies Using Multiple Datasets|author1=Jon W.

== Convective precipitation ==
[[File:Wagga-Cumulonimbus.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Calvus type cumulonimbus cloud]]
{{See also|Rain}}
[[Convection rain|Convective rain]], or showery precipitation, occurs from cumulonimbus clouds.  It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity.  Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds such as thunderstorms have limited horizontal extent.  Most precipitation in the [[tropics]] appears to be convective.&lt;ref name="Geerts"&gt;{{cite web|author =B.

==Lightning==
[[File:Microburstnasa.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Downward motion of cooler air from thunderstorms spreads outward in all directions when the environmental wind flow is light]]
{{See also|Lightning}}
Relationships between lightning frequency and the height of precipitation within thunderstorms have been found.  Thunderstorms which show radar returns above {{convert|14|km|mi}} in height are associated with storms which have more than ten lightning flashes per minute.  There is also a correlation between the total lightning rate and the size of the thunderstorm, its updraft velocity, and amount of graupel over land.  The same relationships fail over tropical oceans, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TuMa5lAa3RAC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=heavy+rain+rates+thunderstorm+book#v=onepage&amp;q=heavy%20rain%20rates%20thunderstorm%20book&amp;f=false|pages=30–31|title=Lightning: Physics and Effects|author1=Vladimir A.

==Aviation concerns==
{{See also|Wind shear}}
In areas where these thunderstorms form in isolation and horizontal visibility is good, pilots can evade these storms rather easily.  In more moist atmospheres which become hazy, pilots navigate above the haze layer in order to get a better vantage point of these storms.  Flying under the anvil of thunderstorms is not advised, as [[hail]] is more likely to fall in such areas outside the thunderstorm's main rain shaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lou7f1tpERoC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=air+mass+thunderstorm#v=onepage&amp;q=air%20mass%20thunderstorm&amp;f=false|title=Weather Flying|author =Robert N.

The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear will become.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ted Fujita|T. T. Fujita]] (1985). "The Downburst, microburst and macroburst".

{{geological eon}}
The '''Archean''' Eon ({{IPAc-en|pron|ɑr|ˈ|k|iː|ə|n}}, also spelled '''Archaean''' or '''Archæan''') is one of the four [[geology|geologic]] [[eon (geology)|eon]]s of [[Earth]] history, occurring {{Ma|4000|2500}} (4 to 2.5 billion years ago). During the Archean, the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] had cooled enough to allow the formation of continents and life started to form.

== Etymology and changes in classification ==
Archean (or Archaean) comes from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Αρχή}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|Arkhē}}''), meaning "beginning, origin". Its earliest use is from 1872, when it meant "of the earliest geological age."&lt;ref&gt;The name "Archean" was coined by American geologist [[James Dwight Dana]] (1813–1895):  {{cite journal |last1=Dana |first1=James D. |title=Green Mountain geology.  On the quartzite. |journal=American Journal of Science and Arts |date=1872 |volume=3 |issue=16 |pages=250-257 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924093036147;view=1up;seq=276 |series=3rd series}} From p. 253: The Pre-Cambrian eon had been believed to be without life (azoic); however, because fossils had been found in deposits that had been judged to belong to the Azoic age, " … I propose to use for the Azoic era and its rocks the general term ''Archæn'' (or Arche'an), from the Greek άρχαιος, ''pertaining to the beginning''.* "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|Archaean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Hadean]] Eon was recognized, the Archean spanned Earth's early history from its formation about 4,540 million years ago until 2,500 million years ago.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Instead of being based on [[stratigraphy]], the beginning and end of the Archean Eon are defined [[Chronometric dating|chronometrically]]. The eon's lower boundary or starting point of 4 [[Billion years|Gya]] (4 [[Bya|billion years ago]]) is officially recognized by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]].&lt;ref name="ICS2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2013-01.pdf | title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart v.2013/01 | publisher=[[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] | date=January 2013 | accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==

When the Archean began, the Earth's [[Earth's internal heat budget|heat flow]] was nearly three times as high as it is today, and it was still twice the current level at the transition from the Archean to the Proterozoic (2,500 million years ago). The extra heat was the result of a mix of remnant heat from [[Accretion (astrophysics)|planetary accretion]], from the formation of the [[Inner core|Earth's core]], and from the disintegration of [[radioactive]] elements.

Although a few mineral grains are known to be [[Hadean]], the oldest rock formations exposed on the surface of the [[Earth]] are Archean. Archean rocks are found in [[Greenland]], [[Siberia]], the [[Canadian Shield]], [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]] (exposed parts of the [[Wyoming Craton]]), the [[Baltic Shield]], [[Geology of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Geological history of India|India]], [[Brazil]], western [[Geology of Australia|Australia]], and southern [[Africa]].  [[Granitic]] rocks predominate throughout the crystalline remnants of the surviving Archean crust. Examples include great melt sheets and voluminous plutonic masses of [[granite]], [[diorite]], [[layered intrusion]]s, [[anorthosite]]s and [[monzonite]]s known as [[sanukitoid]]s. Archean Eon rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as [[graywacke]]s, [[mudstone]]s, volcanic sediments, and [[banded iron formation]]s. [[Volcanic]] activity was considerably higher than today, with numerous lava eruptions, including unusual types such as [[komatiite]].&lt;ref name="Dostal2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/GC/article/view/11074/11722 | title=Igneous Rock Associations 10. Komatiites | last1=Dostal | first1=J. | journal=Geoscience Canada | year=2008 | volume=35 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbonate]] rocks are rare, indicating that the oceans were more acidic due to dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] than during the Proterozoic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Cooper |first2=Richard H. |last2=Miller |first3=Jacqueline |last3=Patterson |title=A Trip Through Time: Principles of Historical Geology |location=Columbus |publisher=Merrill Publishing Company |date=1986 |page=180 |isbn=0675201403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greenstone belt]]s are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating units of metamorphosed [[mafic]] igneous and sedimentary rocks. The metamorphosed igneous rocks were derived from volcanic [[island arc]]s, while the metamorphosed sediments represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island arcs and deposited in a [[forearc]] basin. Greenstone belts, being both types of metamorphosed rock, represent sutures between the protocontinents.&lt;ref name=Stanley&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=Steven M|title=Earth System History|location=New York|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|year=1999|isbn=0716728826}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|302–03}}
[[File:Evolution of Earth's radiogenic heat.svg|thumb|The evolution of Earth's [[Radiogenic nuclide|radiogenic heat]] flow over time]]

The Earth's continents started to form in the Archean, although details about their formation are still being debated, due to lack of extensive geological evidence. One hypothesis is that rocks that are now in India, western Australia, and southern Africa formed a continent called [[Ur (continent)|Ur]] as of 3,100 Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Rogers | first = J. J. W.| title = A history of continents in the past three billion years| year = 1996 | journal = Journal of Geology | volume = 104 | pages = 91–107| doi = 10.1086/629803 | jstor = 30068065 | bibcode=1996JG....104...91R}}&lt;/ref&gt; A differing conflicting hypothesis is that rocks from western Australia and southern Africa were assembled in a continent called [[Vaalbara]] as far back as 3,600 Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Cheney | first = E.

By the end of the Archaean c. 2500 Ma, plate tectonic activity may have been similar to that of the modern Earth. There are well-preserved [[sedimentary basin]]s, and evidence of [[volcanic arc]]s, intracontinental [[rift]]s, continent-continent collisions and widespread globe-spanning [[Orogeny|orogenic events]] suggesting the assembly and destruction of one and perhaps several [[supercontinent]]s. Liquid water was prevalent, and deep oceanic basins are known to have existed attested by the presence of [[banded iron formation]]s, [[chert]] beds, chemical sediments and [[Basalt|pillow basalts]].

==Environment==
The Archean atmosphere is thought to have nearly lacked free [[oxygen]]. Astronomers think that the Sun had about 70–75 percent of the present luminosity, yet temperatures on Earth appear to have been near modern levels after only 500 Ma of Earth's formation (the [[faint young Sun paradox]]). The presence of liquid water is evidenced by certain highly deformed [[gneiss]]es produced by metamorphism of [[sediment]]ary [[protolith]]s. The moderate temperatures may reflect the presence of greater amounts of greenhouse gases than later in the [[History of Earth|Earth's history]].&lt;ref name = "Walker"&gt;{{cite journal

==Early life==
{{Life timeline}}
The [[abiogenesis|processes that gave rise to life on Earth]] are not completely understood, but there is substantial evidence that life came into existence either near the end of the Hadean Eon or early in the Archean Eon.  

The [[Earliest known life forms|earliest evidence]] for [[life]] on Earth are [[graphite]] of [[Biogenic substance|biogenic]] origin found in 3.7-billion-year-old [[metasedimentary rock]]s discovered in [[Kitaa|Western Greenland]].&lt;ref name="NG-20131208"&gt;{{Cite journal|url =http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2025.html|author= Yoko Ohtomo|author2= Takeshi Kakegawa|author3= Akizumi Ishida|author4= Toshiro Nagase|author5= Minik T.

Further evidence for early life is found in 3.47-billon-year-old [[baryte]], in the [[Warrawoona Group]] of Western Australia. This mineral shows sulfur [[fractionation]] of as much as 21.1%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shen|first1=Y|last2=Buick|first2=R|last3=Canfield|first3=DE|date=March 2001|title=Isotopic evidence for microbial sulfate in the early Archaean era|journal=Nature|volume=410|issue=6824|pages=77–81|doi=10.1038/35065017|pmid=11242044|doi-broken-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is evidence of sulfate-reducing bacteria that metabolize [[Isotopes of sulfur|sulfur-32]] more readily than sulfur-34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=RR, II|last=Seal|year=2006|title=Sulfur Isotope Geochemistry of Sulfide Minerals|journal=Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry|volume=61|issue=1|pages=633–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of life in the Late [[Hadean]] is more controversial.

Earth was very hostile to life before 4.2–4.3 Ga and the conclusion is that before the Archean Eon, life as we know it would have been challenged by these environmental conditions.

Life in the Archean was limited to simple single-celled organisms (lacking nuclei), called [[prokaryote|Prokaryota]].  In addition to the domain [[Bacteria]], microfossils of the domain [[Archaea]] have also been identified. There are no known [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] fossils from the earliest Archean, though they might have evolved during the Archean without leaving any.&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt;{{rp|306,323}} No fossil evidence has been discovered for [[ultramicroscopic]] [[intracellular]] replicators such as [[virus]]es.

Fossilized microbes from terrestrial microbial mats show that life was already established on land 3.22 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livescience.com/63199-oldest-life-on-land.html Oldest Evidence for Life on Land Unearthed in South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8429">'''Astra 5°E''' is the name for the [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] [[communications satellite]]s co-located at the 5° east position in the [[Clarke Belt]] which are owned and operated by [[SES S.A.|SES]] based in [[Betzdorf, Luxembourg]]. 5° east is one of the major TV satellite positions serving Europe (the others being at [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2° east]], [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2° east]], [[Hot Bird|13° east]], and [[Astra 23.5°E|23.5° east]]).

The Astra satellites at 5° east provide for services [[downlink]]ing to the Nordic countries, Eastern Europe and sub-Saharan Africa in the 11.70&amp;nbsp;GHz-12.75&amp;nbsp;GHz range of the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]], and at present the [[Astra 4A]] and the [[SES-5]] are regularly operational at this position.

Satellites at 5°E were originally operated by [[Swedish Space Corporation]] (SSC), and then [[Nordic Satellite AB]] (NSAB, itself 50% owned by SSC) before SES took full control of the position and the satellites in 2010, renaming the [[Sirius 4]] satellite to Astra 4A and later adding its own [[Astra 1E]] to the group followed by the SES-5.

==Market==
Astra 5°E is SES' position for [[Direct broadcast satellite|direct-to-home]] (DTH) broadcasting to Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, as well as Eastern European and Baltic countries including Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine, and sub-Saharan Africa.

Over 460 TV, radio and interactive channels (including 9 [[high definition TV]] stations serve over 21 million
direct-to-home, [[SMATV]] and cable homes via the 5°E position. Cable distribution to head-ends, contribution links, data services, and broadband capacity are also provided

Astra 4A provides DTH coverage to multiple African markets with a dedicated K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band beam from a single orbital position, which eliminates the need for dual-illumination from separate beams. This position also provides uplink and downlink within the African footprint, and inter-connectivity between Africa and Europe, so that DTH broadcasting out of Europe is available without the need for expensive fibre links.&lt;ref&gt;SES ASTRA  “5° East” (March, 2010). Company factsheet&lt;/ref&gt;

SES-5 provides two Ku-band beams for DTH services, one for the Nordic and Baltic countries and one serving Sub-Saharan Africa. It also has [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] capacity on a global coverage beam and a hemispheric coverage for Europe, Africa and the Middle East to deliver broadband, maritime communications, GSM backhaul, and VSAT applications. SES-5 also carries a hosted [[L-band]] payload for the European Commission’s [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES ASTRA|date=July 10, 2012|url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2012/11915922 |title=SES-5 TO PROVIDE FRESH SATELLITE CAPACITY IN MULTIPLE FREQUENCY BANDS TO EUROPE, AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST|accessdate = March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reach==
As of the end of 2016, the Astra satellites at 5° east broadcast to 51.6 million households&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ses.com/our-network/orbital-positions ''Our Network/Orbital Positions''] www.ses.com. Accessed March 29, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The Astra 5°E orbital position was originally the [[Direct broadcast satellite]] orbital position allocated to Sweden with [[Swedish Satellite Corporation]]'s Tele-X (launched 1989) the first TV satellite at this position. In 1994, Tele-X was joined by Sirius 1, bought by NSAB from [[BSkyB]] in 1993 after [[Sky Television plc]]'s merger with [[British Satellite Broadcasting]], and moved to 5°E from its original orbital position at 30°West as [[Marcopolo]] 1.

Sirius 1 was later joined at 5° east by Sirius 2 (1997) and then Sirius 3 (1998), with the most recent addition, Sirius 4, launched in November 2007.

Tele-X was retired to a [[graveyard orbit]] in 1998. Sirius 1 was moved to 13° west and renamed Sirius W in 2000 and retired in 2003. In 2008 Sirius 2 was moved to 31.5°E and renamed Astra 5A but in January 2009, the spacecraft suffered a failure and was withdrawn from service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES ASTRA|date=January 16, 2009|url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2009/4468235|title=SES ASTRA Announces End Of ASTRA 5A Spacecraft Mission |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; some four years ahead of its expected end of life. Sirius 3 is in inclined orbit at 51.2° east.

In 2000, SES bought the 50% shareholding in NSAB owned by Teracom and Tele Danmark and in 2003 increased that holding to 75%, renaming the company SES Sirius AB. In 2008 Astra acquired further shares to take its shareholding in SES Sirius to 90% and in March 2010 took full control of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES Astra |date=March 5, 2010 |url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2010/4487003|title=SES ASTRA TAKES FULL OWNERSHIP OF SES SIRIUS |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, the affiliate company was renamed SES Astra and the Sirius 4 satellite renamed Astra 4A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES Astra |date=June 22, 2010 |url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2010/4489346|title=SES SIRIUS BECOMES SES ASTRA |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SES Astra is now a non-autonomous part of SES.

Astra 4A was originally the designation given in 2007 to just part of the Sirius 4 satellite (six transponders of the FSS Africa beam) owned and operated by SES Sirius. From June 2010, the Astra 4A designation has applied to the entire satellite.

In September 2010, [[Astra 1E]] was moved to 5° east to provide further backup for Astra 4A until the launch of [[SES-5]] (Astra 4B). Astra 1E was originally launched to the primary Astra position of [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2°E]] but, prior to its move to 5°E, since October 2007 it had been used at [[Astra 23.5°E|23.5°E]] to provide additional capacity before the launch of Astra 3B to that position in May 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13219">'''Autogamy''', or '''self-fertilization''', refers to the [[Cell fusion|fusion]] of two [[gamete]]s that come from one individual.  Autogamy is predominantly observed in the form of self-pollination, a reproductive mechanism employed by many flowering plants.  However, species of [[protist]]s have also been observed using autogamy as a means of reproduction.  Flowering plants engage in autogamy regularly, while the protists that engage in autogamy only do so in stressful environments.

==Occurrence==

===Protists===
====Paramecium aurelia====
''[[Paramecium aurelia]]'' is the most commonly studied protozoan for autogamy. Similar to other unicellular organisms, ''Paramecium aurelia'' typically reproduce asexually via binary fission or sexually via cross-fertilization.  However, studies have shown that when put under nutritional stress, ''Paramecium aurelia'' will undergo meiosis and subsequent fusion of gametic-like nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, James D. "Autogamy in Paramecium cell cycle stage-specific commitment to meiosis." Experimental cell research 166.2 (1986): 475-485.
&lt;/ref&gt; This process, defined as hemixis, a chromosomal rearrangement process, takes place in a number of steps.  First, the two micronuclei of Paramecium aurelia enlarge and divide two times to form eight nuclei.  Some of these daughter nuclei will continue to divide to create potential future gametic nuclei. Of these potential gametic nuclei, one will divide two more times. Of the four daughter nuclei arising from this step, two of them become anlagen, or cells that will form part of the new organism.  The other two daughter nuclei become the gametic micronuclei that will undergo autogamous self-fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Diller, W. F. (1936), Nuclear reorganization processes in Paramecium aurelia, with descriptions of autogamy and ‘hemixis’. J. Morphol., 59: 11–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  These nuclear divisions are observed mainly when the Paramecium aurelia is put under nutritional stress.  Research shows that ''Paramecium aurelia'' undergo autogamy synchronously with other individuals of the same species.

====Clonal aging and rejuvenation====

In ''[[Paramecium]] tetraurelia'', vitality declines over the course of successive asexual cell divisions by binary fission. Clonal aging is associated with a dramatic increase in [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]].&lt;ref name="pmid424739"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith-Sonneborn J |title=DNA repair and longevity assurance in Paramecium tetraurelia |journal=Science |volume=203 |issue=4385 |pages=1115–7 |year=1979 |pmid=424739 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3091993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holmes GE, Holmes NR |title=Accumulation of DNA damages in aging Paramecium tetraurelia |journal=Mol.

U.S.A. |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=1955–8 |year=1994 |pmid=8127914 |pmc=43283 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When paramecia that have experienced clonal aging undergo [[meiosis]], either during conjugation or automixis, the old macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus is formed by replication of the micronuclear [[DNA]] that had just experienced meiosis followed by syngamy.  These paramecia are rejuvenated in the sense of having a restored clonal lifespan.  Thus it appears that clonal aging is due in large part to the progressive accumulation of DNA damage, and that rejuvenation is due to [[DNA repair|repair of DNA damage]] during meiosis that occurs in the micronucleus during conjugation or automixis and reestablishment of the macronucleus by replication of the newly repaired micronuclear DNA.

====Tetrahymena rostrata====
Similar to Paramecium aurelia, the parasitic [[ciliate]] ''Tetrahymena rostrata'' has also been shown to engage in meiosis, autogamy and development of new macronuclei when placed under nutritional stress.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczanowski, Andrzej. "Cohesion of Clonal Life History, Senescence and Rejuvenation Induced by Autogamy of the Histophagous Ciliate Tetrahymena Rostrata." Protist 167.5 (2016): n. pag. PubMed. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the degeneration and remodeling of genetic information that occurs in autogamy, genetic variability arises and possibly increases an offspring’s chances of survival in stressful environments.

====Allogromia laticollaris====
''[[Allogromia laticollaris]]'' is perhaps the best-studied [[Foraminifera|foraminiferan amoeboid]] for autogamy. ''Allogromia laticollaris'' can alternate between sexual reproduction via cross-fertilization and asexual reproduction via binary fission. The details of the life cycle of Allogromia laticollaris are unknown, but similar to ''Paramecium aurelia'', ''Allogromia laticollaris'' is also shown to sometimes defer to autogamous behavior when placed in nutritional stress. As seen in Paramecium, there is some nuclear dimorphism observed in ''Allogromia laticollaris.''  There are often observations of [[Macronucleus|macronuclei]] and chromosomal fragments coexisting in ''Allogromia laticollaris.''  This is indicative of nuclear and chromosomal degeneration, a process similar to the subdivisions observed in ''Paramecium aurelia.'' Multiple generations of [[Ploidy|haploid]] ''Allogromia laticollaris'' individuals can exist before autogamy actually takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, J. J. and McEnery, M. E. (1970), Autogamy in Allogromia laticollaris (Foraminifera). The Journal of Protozoology, 17: 184–195.&lt;/ref&gt; The autogamous behavior in Allogromia laticollaris has the added consequence of giving rise to daughter cells that are substantially smaller than those rising from binary fission.&lt;ref&gt;K., Sen Gupta B. Modern Foraminifera. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that this is a survival mechanism employed when the cell is in stressful environments, and thus not able to allocate all resources to creating offspring.  If a cell was under nutritional stress and not able to function regularly, there would be a strong possibility of its offspring’s fitness being sub-par.

===Self-pollination in flowering plants===
Self-pollination is an example of autogamy that occurs in flowering plants.  Self-pollination occurs when the sperm in the pollen from the stamen of a plant goes to the carpels of that same plant and fertilizes the egg cell present. Self-pollination can either be done completely autogamously or geitonogamously.  In the former, the egg and sperm cells that united came from the same flower.  In the latter, the sperm and egg cells can come from a different flower on the same plant.  While the latter method does blur the lines between autogamous self-fertilization and normal sexual reproduction, it is still considered autogamous self-fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Christopher G. "Contributions of Autogamy and Geitonogamy to Self-Fertilization in a Mass-Flowering, Clonal Plant." Ecology 81.2 (2000): 532. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-pollination]] can lead to [[inbreeding depression]] due to expression of deleterious recessive [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid19834483"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Charlesworth D, Willis JH |title=The genetics of inbreeding depression |journal=Nat.

Genet. |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=783–96 |year=2009 |pmid=19834483 |doi=10.1038/nrg2664 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meiosis followed by self-pollination results in little genetic variation, raising the question of how meiosis in self-pollinating plants is adaptively maintained over an extended period in preference to a less complicated and less costly asexual ameiotic process for producing progeny. For instance, ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is a predominantly self-pollinating plant that has an outcrossing rate in the wild estimated at less than 0.3%,&lt;ref&gt;Abbott RJ, Gomes MF.

==Advantages of autogamy==
	There are several advantages for the self-fertilization observed in flowering plants and protists.  In flowering plants, it is important for some plants not to be dependent on pollinating agents that other plants rely on for fertilization. This is unusual, however, considering that many plant species have evolved to become incompatible with their own gametes.  While these species would not be well served by having autogamous self-fertilization as a reproductive mechanism, other species, which do not have self-incompatibility, would benefit from autogamy.  Protists have the advantage of diversifying their modes of reproduction. This is useful for a multitude of reasons. First, if there is an unfavorable change in the environment that puts the ability to deliver offspring at risk, then it is advantageous for an organism to have autogamy at its disposal. In other organisms, it is seen that genetic diversity arising from sexual reproduction is maintained by changes in the environment that favor certain genotypes over others.
Aside from extreme circumstances, it is possible that this form of reproduction gives rise to a genotype in the offspring that will increase fitness in the environment.  This is due to the nature of the genetic degeneration and remodeling intrinsic to autogamy in unicellular organisms.  Thus, autogamous behavior may become advantageous to have if an individual wanted to ensure offspring viability and survival. This advantage also applies to flowering plants.  However, it is important to note that this change has not shown to produce a progeny with more fitness in unicellular organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Christopher G., and Christopher R. Herlihy. "Using a Cost-benefit Approach to Understand the Evolution of Self-fertilization in Plants: The Perplexing Case of Aquilegia Canadensis (Ranunculaceae)." Plant Species Biology 19.3 (2004): 159-73. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the nutrition deprived state of the parent cells before autogamy created a barrier for producing offspring that could thrive in those same stressful environments.

==Disadvantages of autogamy==
	In flowering plants, autogamy has the disadvantage of producing low genetic diversity in the species that use it as the predominant mode of reproduction. This leaves those species particularly susceptible to pathogens and viruses that can harm it. In addition, the foraminiferans that use autogamy have shown to produce substantially smaller progeny as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Christopher G. "Contributions of Autogamy and Geitonogamy to Self-Fertilization in a Mass-Flowering, Clonal Plant." Ecology 81.2 (2000): 532. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  This indicates that since it is generally an emergency survival mechanism for unicellular species, the mechanism does not have the nutritional resources that would be provided by the organism if it were undergoing binary fission.

==Evolution of autogamy==
	The evolutionary shift from outcrossing to self-fertilization is one of the most frequent evolutionary transitions in plants.  About 10-15% of [[flowering plant]]s are predominantly self-fertilizing.&lt;ref name="pmid23595268"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wright SI, Kalisz S, Slotte T |title=Evolutionary consequences of self-fertilization in plants |journal=Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume=280 |issue=1760 |pages=20130133 |year=2013 |pmid=23595268 |pmc=3652455 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.0133 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since autogamy in flowering plants and autogamy in unicellular species is fundamentally different, and plants and protists are not related, it is likely that both instances evolved separately.  In flowering plants, it is believed that autogamy evolved one million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Chunlao, Tang. "The Evolution of Selfing in Arabidopsis Thaliana." Science317.5841 (2007): 1070--72. AAAS. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, due to the little overall genetic variation that arises in progeny, it is not fully understood how autogamy has been maintained in the tree of life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2556">[[File:Bajio Dry Forests map.svg|thumb|300px|'''Bajio Dry Forests''' [[ecoregion]] in western−central [[Mexico]].]]
The '''Bajío dry forests''' [[ecoregion]], of the [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests]] [[Biome]], is located in western−central [[Mexico]].

==Geography==
The Bajío dry forests lie in the southwestern portion of the [[Mexican Plateau]]. They are bounded on the southeast, south, and southwest by the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests]], which occupy the folded mountains and volcanoes of the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] that form the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau. The [[Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests]] of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] bound the ecoregion on the northwest.

The numerous mountains of the plateau which rise above the dry forests are occupied by [[sky island]]s of pine-oak forest. To the north, the Bajío dry forests transition to the drier, more temperate [[Central Mexican Matorral]]. Most of the ecoregion lies within the basin of the [[Lerma River]], and the dry forests extend around [[Lake Chapala]] at the eastern end of the region, and into the [[endorheic basin]]s of [[Lake Cuitzeo]] and [[Lake Pátzcuaro]] in the south.

==Fauna==
Native Mammals include [[Mexican wolf]] ''(Canus lupus baileyi)'' and [[pocketed free-tailed bat]] ''(Nyctinomops femorosaccus).'' Birds include the [[black-throated magpie-jay]] ''(Calocitta colliei),'' [[thick-billed kingbird]] ''(Tyrannus crassirostris),'' [[whiskered screech owl]] ''(Otus trichopsus),'' [[orange-fronted parakeet]] ''(Aratinga caniculanis),'' [[dwarf vireo]] ''(Vireo nelsoni)'', and [[black-polled yellowthroat]] ''(Geothlypis speciosa).''

==Development==
The ecoregion is densely populated, and centuries of human use have reduced the dry forests to small pockets. Dry deciduous forest used to be the dominant vegetation, but thorn scrub and subtropical matorral are now more common, interspersed with agricultural and pasture lands. The cities of [[Guadalajara]], [[Morelia]], and [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]] lie within the ecoregion.

It is located in the Belgrade's municipality of [[Voždovac]] and until 2015 was known as '''Banjica Forest''' ({{lang-sr|Бањичка шума|Banjička šuma}}}.

== Location ==

Byford's Forest is a meridionally elongated wooded area between the Boulevard of the Liberation on the east and the street of ''Pavla Jurišića Šturma'' on the west. South and southeast border is marked by the ''Crnotravska'' street. It begins less than {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} away from [[Terazije]], downtown Belgrade. It borders the neighborhoods of [[Diplomatska Kolonija]] and [[Dedinje]] on the west, [[Banjica]] on the southwest and south, [[Trošarina]] on the southeast and Voždovac on the east. The forest is some {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} long, up to 300 {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}} wide and covers an area of {{convert|0.4|km2|abbr=on}}.

== History ==

Before [[World War I]] there was a wood in this area, but was cut down to make room for the vegetable gardens. During the [[Interbellum]], military command built workshops for the repair of the vehicles within the complex of the military auto motorized units of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] (Serbian: [[Autokomanda]]), which gave name to the neighboring square and the neighborhood. Prior to the [[World War II]], shooting range was located here. In an effort to create the forested belt around the Belgrade, the forest, initially named Banjica Forest, was planted from 1948 to 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Milan Janković | title = Beogradske šume preživele i ratove | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 27 April 2014 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/291240/Beogradske-sume-prezivele-i-ratove}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, [[Šumice (Belgrade)|Šumice]] Forest was created as a part of the same project).

== Wildlife ==
=== Plant life ===

Most common tree species are [[pedunculate oak]], [[red maple]], [[silver maple]] and [[box elder]], but there are many others as well. There are numerous wildflowers on the forest floor, including [[wood avens]], [[violet (plant)|violets]], [[strawberries]], [[garlic mustard]], [[deadnettle]]s etc.

=== Animal life ===

[[Bird]] species are very diverse so because of them, Banjica forest is now a [[natural monument]], protected by the state. 68 bird species live in the forest, 40 of which are [[resident bird]]s, 16 are [[migratory bird]]s and 12 are passing.&lt;ref&gt;Plate at forest's entrances&lt;/ref&gt; The most common breeding birds are [[nightingale]], [[blackcap]], [[great tit]], [[European magpie]], [[hooded crow]], [[common blackbird]], [[woodpigeon]] and [[great spotted woodpecker]]. Other bird species in the forest include [[pheasant]], [[common kestrel]], [[Eurasian sparrowhawk]], [[tawny owl]] and [[common chaffinch]]. During the winter, [[hawks]], [[common buzzard]]s and [[song thrush]] also settle in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = A.V. | title = Ptice Bajfordove šume| newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = 15 | language = Serbian | date = 23 May 2017| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammals include Eastern European [[hedgehog]], [[mole (animal)|moles]], several species of [[shrews]], various [[bat]]s, the local brown subspecies of the [[red squirrel]], [[wood mouse]], [[yellow-necked mouse]] and [[least weasel]]. Altogether, there are 10 species of mammals in the forest, including [[hares]] which settled the forest in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Branka Vasiljević | title = Prestonica - dom za sisare | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = November 2008 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
[[Image:Banjica Forest.svg|thumb|290px|right|Map of the Bayford's forest]]

The man-made facilities in the forest include the [[Lukoil]] gas station and the [[Best Western]] 
Hotel "M". The south-western extension of the forest was turned into the large sports complex of ''Banjica'' decades ago.

On the occasion of the April 22, 2007, the [[Earth Day]], the city government announced its plans for the Banjica forest in 2007, which will include the construction of the [[trim trail]], artificial bed for the forest's [[stream]] and placing of bird houses through the forest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Politika]] daily, April 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the spring of 2011, the main forest path (going along the length of the forest) has a form of a functional trim trail, while the smaller paths are left in their natural state. Some old trees were cut and timber was cut in smaller pieces and left at the spot, attracting insects and insect-eating birds. Benches and wooden wastebaskets are placed periodically along the trim trail, while there are also several well-spaced spots with information tables and multiple benches under wooden roofs, intended for rest of several families. There are a wooden and a stone-based bridge over the widest parts of the stream, as well as several plank bridges over the narrowest parts. Bird houses are placed all over the forest.

== Name change ==

[[Timothy John Byford]], British director, author and educator, who lived in Serbia since 1971, studied birds in the forest, and from 1986 to 1989, collected data on all 68 species. He began an initiative to protect the forest. He died in 2014, before the forest was placed under protection. The Institute for Nature Conservation of Serbia and the Belgrade City Secretariat for Environmental Protection, after a public hearing, declared the forest a [[natural monument]] on 15 September 2015. Also, by the same act, the name of the forest was changed to the Byford's Forest.&lt;ref name="tanjug"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zzps.rs/novo/index.php?jezik=_en&amp;strana=vest&amp;n=267-1 Institute for Nature Conservation of Serbia - The public hearing on "Byford`s Forest"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6144">{{short description|A body of water that once separated North America from South America}}
The '''Central American Seaway''', also known as the '''Panamanic''' '''Inter-American''' and '''Proto-Caribbean Seaway''', was a body of water that once separated [[North America]] from [[South America]]. It formed in the [[Mesozoic]] (200–154 [[year#Abbreviations yr and ya|Ma]]) during the breakup of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]], and closed when the [[Isthmus of Panama]] was formed by [[volcanic]] activity in the late [[Pliocene]] (2.76–2.54 Ma).
[[File:Great American Biotic Interchange examples.svg|thumb|'''Figure 1. The Great American Interchange''']]
The closure of the Central American Seaway had tremendous effects on [[Ocean current|oceanic circulation]] and the [[biogeography]] of the adjacent seas, isolating many species and triggering [[speciation]] and diversification of tropical and sub-tropical marine fauna.&lt;ref name = "Lessios"&gt;{{cite journal

==Evidence==
The evidence for when the Central American landmass emerged and the closing of  the Central American Seaway can be divided into three categories. The first is the direct geologic observation of crustal thickening and submarine deposits in Central America. The second is the [[Great American Interchange]] of vertebrates between North and South America which required a continuous land bridge across the two areas for the organisms to travel along with a climate that was very different than the climate today. Lastly is the development of differences in marine assemblages and their isotopic signatures in the Caribbean from those in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colorado.edu/geolsci/faculty/molnarpdf/2008Paleoc.CentralAmericanSeaway.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.colorado.edu/geolsci/faculty/molnarpdf/2008Paleoc.CentralAmericanSeaway.pdf|title = Closing of the Central American Seaway and the Ice Age: A critical review|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Molnar|first = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central American Seaway was closed by the elevation of the [[Central American Isthmus]] which is proposed to have occurred three and a half to five million years ago. The closing of the Central American Seaway is also supported by the evolution of taxa on different sides of the Central American Isthmus along with the different histories of the oceans on either side of the isthmus.

==Consequences==
The closing of the seaway allowed a major migration of land mammals between North and South America or The [[Great American Interchange]]. This allowed the entrance of species of mammals such as cats, horses, elephants and camels to migrate from North America to South America. There is much controversy about glacial and interglacial climates in South America. Research shows that vegetation in most of the [[Amazon basin]] has changed a very small amount since glacial times. It is also believed that the area was more of a savannah during glacial times, but it is believed that the area is quite the same. Predicted connections between a closed seaway and glaciation are causation for a very different North Atlantic Ocean circulation having an effect on the surrounding atmospheric temperatures. The emergence of the isthmus caused a reflection of the westward-flowing North Equatorial Current northward and enhanced the northward-flowing Gulf Stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tertiary Period {{!}} geochronology|url = http://www.britannica.com/science/Tertiary-Period#ref586127|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15178">In [[astronomy]], '''color–color diagrams''' are a means of comparing the [[apparent magnitude]]s of [[star]]s at different [[wavelength]]s. [[Astronomer]]s typically observe at narrow bands around certain wavelengths, and objects observed will have different [[luminosity|brightnesses]] in each band. The difference in brightness between two bands is referred to as [[color index|color]]. On color–color diagrams, the color defined by two wavelength bands is plotted on the horizontal [[coordinate axis|axis]], and then the color defined by another brightness difference (though usually there is one band involved in determining both colors) will be plotted on the vertical axis.

[[File:Effective temperature and color index.png|thumb|Effective temperature of a black body compared with the ''B-V'' and ''U-B'' [[Photometric system|color index]] of main sequence and super giant stars in what is called a ''color-color diagram''.&lt;ref name=UBV&gt;
Figure modeled after {{cite book |title=Introduction to Stellar Astrophysics: Basic stellar observations and data |author=E. Böhm-Vitense |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWrtilsCycQC&amp;pg=PA26 |page=26 |chapter=Figure 4.9 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-34869-2 |year=1989}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Stars emit less [[ultraviolet radiation]] than a black body with the same ''B-V'' index.]]
Although stars are not perfect [[black body|blackbodies]], to first order the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] of light emitted by stars conforms closely to a [[black-body radiation]] curve, also referred to sometimes as a [[thermal radiation]] curve. The overall shape of a black-body curve is uniquely determined by its [[temperature]], and the wavelength of peak intensity is inversely proportional to temperature, a relation known as [[Wien's Displacement Law]]. Thus, observation of a [[stellar spectrum]] allows determination of its [[effective temperature]]. Obtaining complete spectra for stars through [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectrometry]] is much more involved than simple [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] in a few bands. Thus by comparing the magnitude of the star in multiple different [[color index|color indices]], the [[effective temperature]] of the star can still be determined, as magnitude differences between each color will be unique for that temperature. As such, color-color diagrams can be used as a means of representing the stellar population, much like a [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], and stars of different [[stellar classification|spectral classes]] will inhabit different parts of the diagram. This feature leads to applications within various wavelength bands.

In the stellar locus, stars tend to align in a more or less straight feature. If stars were perfect black bodies, the stellar locus would be a pure straight line indeed. The divergences with the straight line are due to the absorptions and emission lines in the stellar spectra. These divergences can be more or less evident depending on the filters used: narrow filters with central wavelength located in regions without lines, will produce a response close to the black body one, and even filters centered at lines if they are broad enough, can give a reasonable blackbody-like behavior.

Therefore, in most cases the straight feature of the stellar locus can be described by Ballesteros' formula &lt;ref name=Ballesteros&gt;Ballesteros, F.J. (2012). "New insights into black bodies ". EPL 97 (2012) 34008. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.1809.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; deduced for pure blackbodies:

:&lt;math&gt;C - D = \frac{\nu_c - \nu_d}{\nu_a - \nu_b} (A - B) + k, &lt;/math&gt;

where A, B, C and D are the magnitudes of the stars measured through filters with central frequencies &lt;math&gt;\nu_a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\nu_b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;

\nu_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu_d&lt;/math&gt; respectively, and k is a constant depending on the central wavelength and width of the filters, given by:

:&lt;math&gt; k = -2.5 \log_{10} \left[ {\left( {\frac{{\nu_c }}{{\nu_d }}} \right)^2 
\left( {\frac{{\Delta_c }}{{\Delta_d }}} \right)  \left( {\frac{{\nu_b }}{{\nu_a }}} \right)^{2\frac{{\nu_c  - \nu_d }}{{\nu_a  - \nu_b }}} \left( {\frac{{\Delta_b }}{{\Delta_a }}} \right)^{\frac{{\nu_c  - \nu_d }}{{\nu_a  - \nu_b }}} } \right] &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the slope of the straight line depends only on the effective wavelength, not in the filter width.

Although this formula cannot be directly used to calibrate data, if one has data well calibrated for two given filters, it can be used to calibrate data in other filters. It can be used to measure the effective wavelength midpoint of an unknown filter too, by using
two well known filters. This can be useful to recover information on the filters used
for the case of old data, when logs are not conserved and filter information has been lost.

===Photometric calibration===

[[File:Stellar-locus-regression.png|thumb|right|A schematic illustration of the stellar locus regression method of photometric calibration in astronomy.]]
The color-color diagram of stars can be used to directly calibrate or to test colors and magnitudes in optical and infrared imaging data.  Such methods take advantage of the fundamental distribution of stellar colors in our galaxy across the vast majority of the sky, and the fact that observed stellar colors (unlike [[apparent magnitude]]s) are independent of the distance to the stars.

&lt;/ref&gt; was a method developed to eliminate the need for standard star observations in photometric calibrations, except highly infrequently (once a year or less) to measure color terms.  SLR has been used in a number of research initiatives.  The NEWFIRM survey of the [http://www.noao.edu/noao/noaodeep/ NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey] region used it to arrive at more accurate colors than would have otherwise been attainable by traditional calibration methods, and [[South Pole Telescope]] used SLR in the measurement of redshifts of [[galaxy clusters]].&lt;ref name = high10&gt;

===Color outliers===
Analyzing data from large observational surveys, such as the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] or [[2 Micron All Sky Survey]] (2MASS), can be challenging due to the huge number of data produced. For surveys such as these, color-color diagrams have been used to find outliers from the [[main sequence]] stellar population. Once these outliers are identified, they can then be studied in more detail. This method has been used to identify ultracool [[subdwarf]]s.&lt;ref name="subdwarf1"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Burgasser, A.

===Star formation===

[[File:Trapezium cluster optical and infrared comparison.jpg|thumb|left|The optical image (left) shows clouds of dust, while the infrared image (right) displays a number of young stars. ''Credit: C. R. O'Dell-Vanderbilt University, NASA, and ESA''.]]

Color–color diagrams are often used in [[infrared]] astronomy to study [[star formation|star forming]] regions. Stars form in [[interstellar cloud|clouds]] of [[cosmic dust|dust]]. As the star continues to contract, a circumstellar disk of dust is formed, and this dust is heated by the star inside. The dust itself then begins to radiate as a blackbody, though one much cooler than the star. As a result, an [[infrared excess|excess of infrared radiation]] is observed for the star. Even without circumstellar dust, regions undergoing star formation exhibit high infrared [[luminosity|luminosities]] compared to stars on the main sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C. Struck-Marcell |author2=B.M. Tinsley | year = 1978 | title = Star formation rates and infrared radiation | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=221 | pages=562–566 | bibcode=1978ApJ...221..562S | doi=10.1086/156057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these effects is distinct from the reddening of starlight which occurs as a result of [[scattering]] off of dust in the [[interstellar medium]].

[[File:Trapez ccdiag.jpg|thumb|right|Color–color diagram of the Trapezium cluster shows that many cluster members exhibit infrared excess, which is characteristic of stars with circumstellar disks.]]

Color–color diagrams allow for these effects to be isolated. As the color–color relationships of [[main sequence]] stars are well known, a theoretical main sequence can be plotted for reference, as is done with the solid black line in the example to the right. [[Interstellar dust]] scattering is also well understood, allowing bands to be drawn on a color–color diagram defining the region in which stars [[interstellar reddening|reddened]] by interstellar dust are expected to be observed, indicated on the color–color diagram by dashed lines. The typical axes for infrared color–color diagrams have (H–K) on the horizontal axis and (J–H) on the vertical axis (see [[infrared astronomy]] for information on band color designations). On a diagram with these axes, stars which fall to the right of the main sequence and the reddening bands drawn are significantly brighter in the K band than main sequence stars, including main sequence stars which have experienced reddening due to interstellar dust. Of the J, H, and K bands, K is the longest wavelength, so objects which are anomalously bright in the K band are said to exhibit [[infrared excess]]. These objects are likely [[Protostar|protostellar]] in nature, with the excess radiation at long wavelengths caused by suppression by the [[reflection nebula]] in which the protostars are embedded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lada, C.J. | title = Infrared L-Band Observations of the Trapezium Cluster: A Census of Circumstellar Disks and Candidate Protostars | journal = The Astronomical Journal | volume = 120 | issue = 6 | pages = 3162–3176 | year = 2000 | bibcode = 2000AJ....120.3162L | doi = 10.1086/316848|arxiv = astro-ph/0008280 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color–color diagrams can be used then as a means of studying stellar formation, as the state of a star in its formation can be roughly determined by looking at its position on the diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Charles Lada |author2=Fred Adams | year=1992 | title=Interpreting infrared color-color diagrams – Circumstellar disks around low- and intermediate-mass young stellar objects | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=393 | pages=278–288 | bibcode=1992ApJ...393..278L | doi=10.1086/171505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Continents colour.svg|thumb|300px|In a classic map of the world (with north at the top), the southern ends of the continental landmasses appear to "drip" downward.]]

'''Continental drip''' is the observation that southward-pointing landforms are more numerous and prominent than northward-pointing landforms. For example, [[Africa]], [[South America]], [[India]] etc. all taper off to a point towards the south. The name is a [[word play|play]] on ''[[continental drift]]''.

The observation was made by Ormonde de Kay in a 1973 [[tongue-in-cheek]] paper.&lt;ref name=deKay1973&gt;{{cite book |last=de Kay, Jr. |first=Ormonde |chapter=Continental Drip |orig-year=condensed from {{List journal |work=Horizon |date=Winter 1973}} |editor-last=Weber |editor-first=Robert L. |title=More Random Walks in Science |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YrbanNOQ-bcC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=CRC Press |date=1982 |pages=201–203 |isbn=978-0854980406}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John C.

Flood forecasting is an important component of [[flood warning]], where the distinction between the two is that the outcome of flood forecasting is a set of forecast time-profiles of channel flows or river levels at various locations, while "flood warning" is the task of making use of these forecasts to tell decisions on warnings of floods.

'''Geotope''' is the [[geology|geological]] component of the [[abiotic]] matrix present in an [[ecotope]]. Example geotopes might be: an exposed outcrop of rocks, an [[glacial erratic|erratic boulder]], a grotto or ravine, a cave, an old stone wall marking a property boundary, and so forth.

It is a loanword from German ''([[:de:Geotop|Geotop]])'' in the study of ecology and might be the model for many other similar words coined by analogy. As the prototype, it has enjoyed wider currency than many of the other words modelled on it, including [[physiotope]], with which it is used synonymously. But the geotope is properly the rocks and not the whole lay of the land (which would be the physiotope).

The '''global temperature record''' shows the fluctuations of the [[temperature]] of the atmosphere and the oceans through various spans of time.  The most detailed information exists since 1850, when methodical thermometer-based records began.  There are numerous estimates of temperatures since the end of the [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciation]], particularly during the current [[Holocene]] epoch.  Older time periods are studied by [[paleoclimatology]].

{{main|Satellite temperature measurements}}
[[Weather balloon]] [[radiosonde]] measurements of atmospheric temperature at various altitudes begin to show an approximation of global coverage in the 1950s. Since December 1978, [[microwave sounding unit]]s on satellites have produced data which can be used to [[MSU temperature measurements|infer temperatures]] in the [[troposphere]].

Several groups have analyzed the satellite data to calculate temperature trends in the troposphere. Both the [[UAH satellite temperature dataset|University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH) and the private, NASA funded, corporation [[Remote Sensing Systems]] [[Remote Sensing Systems|RSS]] (RSS) find an upward trend.

For the lower troposphere (TLT), UAH find a global average trend since 1978 of +0.140&amp;nbsp;°C/decade, to January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/t2lt/tltglhmam_5.4|title=MONTHLY MEANS OF LOWER TROPOSPHERE LT5.4|work=UAH|accessdate=26 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717025455/http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/t2lt/tltglhmam_5.4|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Temperature record of the past 1000 years}}

[[Proxy (climate)|Proxy]] measurements can be used to reconstruct the temperature record before the historical period. Quantities such as [[tree ring]] widths, [[Coral#Climate research|coral growth]], [[Ice core#Isotopic analysis|isotope variations]] in [[ice core]]s, ocean and lake sediments, [[Speleothem#As climate proxies|cave deposits]], [[fossil]]s, [[ice core]]s, [[Proxy (climate)#Boreholes|borehole temperature]]s, and [[glacier]] length records are correlated with climatic fluctuations. From these, proxy temperature reconstructions of the last 2000 years have been performed for the northern hemisphere, and over shorter time scales for the southern hemisphere and tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Geographic coverage by these proxies is necessarily sparse, and various proxies are more sensitive to faster fluctuations. For example, tree rings, ice cores, and corals generally show variation on an annual time scale, but borehole reconstructions rely on [[Thermal diffusivity|rates of thermal diffusion]], and small scale fluctuations are washed out. Even the best proxy records contain far fewer observations than the worst periods of the observational record, and the spatial and temporal resolution of the resulting reconstructions is correspondingly coarse. Connecting the measured proxies to the variable of interest, such as temperature or rainfall, is highly non-trivial. Data sets from multiple complementary proxies covering overlapping time periods and areas are reconciled to produce the final reconstructions.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (U.S.).

Proxy reconstructions extending back 2,000 years have been performed, but reconstructions for the last 1,000 years are supported by more and higher quality independent data sets. These reconstructions indicate:&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (U.S.).

* global mean surface temperatures over the last 25 years have been higher than any comparable period since AD 1600, and probably since AD 900
* there was a [[Little Ice Age]] centered on AD 1700
* there was a [[Medieval Warm Period]] centered on AD 1000, though the exact timing and magnitude are uncertain and may have shown regional variation.

=== Indirect historical proxies ===

As well as natural, numerical proxies (tree-ring widths, for example) there exist records from the human historical period that can be used to infer climate variations, including: reports of [[frost fair]]s on the [[Thames]]; records of good and bad harvests; dates of spring blossom or lambing; extraordinary falls of rain and snow; and unusual floods or droughts.&lt;ref&gt;O.Muszkat, ''The outline of the problems and methods used for research of the history of the climate in the Middle Ages'', (in polish), Przemyśl 2014, {{ISSN|1232-7263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such records can be used to infer historical temperatures, but generally in a more qualitative manner than natural proxies.

Recent evidence suggests that a sudden and short-lived [[4.2 kiloyear event|climatic shift between 2200 and 2100 BCE]] occurred in the region between [[Tibet]] and [[Iceland]], with some evidence suggesting a global change.  The result was a cooling and reduction in precipitation.  This is believed to be a primary cause of the collapse of the [[Old Kingdom]] of [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/apocalypse_egypt_04.shtml The Fall of the Egyptian Old Kingdom] Hassan, Fekri BBC June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holocene Temperature Variations.png|240px|thumb|Plot showing the variations, and relative stability, of climate during the last 12000 years.]]
{{main|Paleoclimatology}}
Many estimates of past temperatures have been made over [[History of Earth|Earth's history]].  The field of paleoclimatology includes ancient temperature records.  As the present article is oriented toward recent temperatures, there is a focus here on events since the retreat of the [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciers]].  The 10,000 years of the [[Holocene]] epoch covers most of this period, since the end of the Northern Hemisphere's [[Younger Dryas]] millennium-long cooling.  The [[Holocene Climatic Optimum]] was generally warmer than the 20th century, but numerous regional variations have been noted since the start of the Younger Dryas.

Even longer term records exist for few sites: the recent Antarctic [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica|EPICA]] core reaches 800 kyr; many others reach more than 100,000 years. The EPICA core covers eight glacial/interglacial cycles. The [[North Greenland Ice Core Project|NGRIP]] core from Greenland stretchs back more than 100 kyr, with 5 kyr in the [[Eemian interglacial]]. Whilst the large-scale signals from the cores are clear, there are problems interpreting the detail, and connecting the isotopic variation to the temperature signal.

{{main|Geologic temperature record}}
On longer time scales, sediment cores show that the cycles of glacials and interglacials are part of a deepening phase within a prolonged ice age that began with the glaciation of [[Antarctica]] approximately 40 million years ago.  This deepening phase, and the accompanying cycles, largely began approximately 3 million years ago with the growth of continental ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere.  Gradual changes in Earth's climate of this kind have been frequent during the Earth's 4500 million year existence and most often are attributed to changes in the configuration of continents and ocean sea ways.

'''Gribskov''' (Grib Forest) is [[Denmark]]'s fourth largest forest,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trae.dk/index.asp?page=/dokumenter/dokument.asp%3FDokumentID%3D1092 Denmarks 10 largest forests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308120621/http://www.trae.dk/index.asp?page=%2Fdokumenter%2Fdokument.asp%3FDokumentID%3D1092 |date=2012-03-08 }} The Danish Wood Initiative (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; comprising c. 5,600 ha of woodland situated in northern [[Zealand]], west and south of [[Lake Esrum]]. The forest is owned and administered by [[Directorate of State Forestry (Denmark)|the State of Denmark]], and a part of the [[Kongernes Nordsjælland National Park]].&lt;ref name=KNS&gt;{{cite web |date=23 May 2018 |title=Om Kongernes Nordsjælland |url=http://www.kongernes-nordsjælland.dk/om-kongernes-nordsjaelland/ | publisher=kongernes-nordsjælland.dk | language=Danish | accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, it was one of three forests included in a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], the [[Par force hunting landscape in North Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1315/|title=Sites in Denmark, France and Turkey inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List|website=unesco.org|publisher=UNESCO|date=4 July 2015|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gribskov is usually divided into four sections: The northwest surrounding the small village of [[Maarum]], the northeast on the banks of [[Lake Esrum]], the southwest around the small lake of Gribsø and finally the southeast, enclosing the village of [[Nødebo]] on the southern banks of Lake Esrum.

Only a thin strip of [[Hillerød]] town in the south separates Gribskov from many larger woodlands such as [[Store Dyrehave]] at 1,100 ha, [[Tokkekøb Hegn]] at 631 ha and several smaller woods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Sj%C3%A6lland/Store_Dyrehave Store Dyrehave] Gydendals Open Encyclopedia {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Udgivelser/Vandretursfoldere/atilaa/Tokkekoeb.htm Tokkekøb Hegn] Danish Nature Agency {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Danish language|Danish]] name Gribskov translates literally as ''Grib forest'' in English. The first part, 'grib', is the imperative form of the verb for 'catch' or 'grab',&lt;ref&gt;'Grib' also translates to ''vulture'' in English, but that meaning is not associated with Gribskov.&lt;/ref&gt; but the actual meaning and [[etymology]] of the word go a bit deeper. 'Grib' refers to the [[Old Danish]] word for something 'without any specific owner', so 'Gribskov' actually means a woodland of common ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Udgivelser/Vandretursfoldere/atilaa/Gribskov.htm Gribskov] Danish Nature Agency {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
Gribskov and Lake Esrum are designated as [[Habitats Directive|EU habitat directive]] and [[Natura 2000]] areas, as part of an even larger preserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Naturbeskyttelse/Natura2000/Natura_2000_planer/Se_Planerne/126_246/133_Gribskov.htm 133 Gribskov, Esrum Sø, Esrum Å and Snævret Skov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231013022/http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Naturbeskyttelse/Natura2000/Natura_2000_planer/Se_Planerne/126_246/133_Gribskov.htm |date=2013-12-31 }} Danish Nature agency {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On top of that, Gribskov is designated as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA). Around 20% or c. 1,200 ha of the forest has been reserved as 'forest to be untouched', in an effort to preserve some of the few spots of [[semi-natural woodland]] (SNW) in Denmark and stimulate the growth of new.

The birdlife in Gribskov is varied and of international importance. The forest is home to the largest populations of [[common goldeneye]], [[green sandpiper]] and [[red-backed shrike]] in Denmark&lt;ref name=DOF&gt;[http://www.dof.dk/sider/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=591&amp;Itemid=656 Gribskov] Danish Ornitological Association (DOF) {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and near Nødebo at Lake Esrum, a noisy colony of [[great cormorant]]s has found a home. Cormorants can be a problematic bird to administer locally, but they are protected in Denmark and on list III in the [[Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Berne convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://naturstyrelsen.dk/naturbeskyttelse/artsleksikon/dyr/fugle/skarver/skarv/ Skarv] Danish Nature agency {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forest grows in a hilly terrain (by Danish standards), with lower lying areas in the east and west. The low-lying areas are dominated by [[beech]] and [[oak]], but with several forest types mixed in, such as [[wood pasture]]s or old [[coppice]] woodland with [[alder]] and [[ash (tree)|ash]]. There are also numerous small ponds, bogs, swamps and springs, some enshrouded by myths, superstition or old folk tales.&lt;ref name=DOF/&gt;

Gribskov is more than 10,000 years old, dating from the end of the [[Weichselian glaciation|last ice age]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Naturoplevelser/Beskrivelser/Hovedstaden/Gribskov/Gribskovs_historie/ History of Gribskov] Danish Nature Agency {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the forest bears the marks of an intensive plantation industry that accelerated from the late 1700s and peaked in the 1800s. Former wetlands were drained and many new tree species were introduced, especially [[European spruce]]. These practises have now stopped in Gribskov. Artificial ditches are being filled to allow a more natural waterflow and the spruce plantations are cut down, to be naturally and quickly replaced by [[alder]], [[birch]] and [[willow]] in coming years. It is expected that Gribskov will comprise more semi-natural woodland of [[deciduous trees]] in the future.

The forest of Gribskov offers a rare opportunity to observe free roaming deer of all the four species living in Denmark; namely the [[roe deer]], [[sika deer]], [[red deer]] and [[fallow deer]], with roe and fallow deer being most common in Gribskov. Roe deer have lived here for as long as the forest itself, while fallow deer were introduced at some point during the [[middle ages]]. The fallow deer population in Gribskov is the largest free roaming fallow deer population in Denmark, at 600-800 animals.

=== Lakes, ponds and wetlands ===
There has been a long tradition of surface water draining by ditch-digging and natural waterflow regulation in Gribskov for various reasons, but these practises have now ceased and work is in progress to re-establish a more natural waterflow and improved conditions for wetland areas.&lt;ref name=Marie-Louise&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/NR/rdonlyres/410F146A-B131-4C05-9F67-EBFE9498F018/64448/Abstract.pdf Reestablishment of natural hydrology in Gribskov and St. Dyrehave. A pilot project on areas affected by storm damage.] Marie-Louise Olsen. English summary of the report.&lt;/ref&gt; These measures have already enhanced the [[biodiversity|biological diversity]] and has had a direct positive influence on the living conditions for birds in the forest. 

There are several interesting bodies of water in Gribskov, seen both from a scientific and a [[folklore|folkloristic]] viewpoint. ''Store Gribsø'' (Large Grib-lake), or simply ''Gribsø'', is only a 10 ha lake, but is nevertheless the largest forest-enclosed lake in Gribskov. It is a so-called [[dystrophic lake]] and it is impossible to see the bottom in its dark waters, even though it is only 11 m deep. The lake has no outflows and it can be ice cold just beneath the surface, so care should be taken when bathing. Tradition says the lake is bottomless and was created when God angrily punished a [[nunnery]] that once was here. The [[nun]]s showed more interest in the monks at [[Esrum Abbey]] than in God, so he opened up the ground and the chasm swallowed up all the nuns and the entire monastery. The monastery continued to sink and sink and that was how the lake was created. It is said that one can still hear the monastery's bells ringing down in the lake on quiet evenings.

==Landmarks and structures==
There are many small ponds, streams and lakes throughout Gribskov, but the larger ones—''Store Gribsø'', ''Solbjerg Engsø'' and ''Strødam Engsø''—all are situated in the southwestern parts. The latter two are the largest and attract a rich birdlife, but they are both on the edge of the forest.

The most prominent landmark is perhaps ''Svenskegrøften'' (lit.: The Swedish Ditch) initiated in 1576. It is a 2–3&amp;nbsp;km long artificial canal, winding its way through the forest from the lake of Store Gribsø and south towards the settlement of [[Gadevang]] in the southeastern section. As the name implies, [[Swedish people|Swedish]] prisoners of war were used for this large project, ordered by [[Frederick II of Denmark|King Frederik II]]. The ditch is just one part of a larger network of ditches dug since the middle ages, to supply the [[Frederiksborg Palace]] with running water, to exploit the water resource for watermills in earlier times and to drain the wetlands so the land could be used for plantations. There are an estimated 526&amp;nbsp;km of artificial ditches in Gribskov.&lt;ref name=Marie-Louise /&gt;

===Pre-history===
There are several relics of the past in Gribskov. One example is the megalithic [[passage grave]] just outside [[Kagerup]], a village south of [[Maarum]] in the northwest of the forest. It was raised at some point in the neolithic [[Nordic Stone Age|Stone Age]], about 5-6,000 years ago and is referred to as ''Jættestuen'', simply meaning The Passage Grave in English.&lt;ref&gt;The Danish word ''Jættestue'' for passage grave, actually translates as "the Jötunns room" referring to the [[Jötunn]]s of [[Norse mythology]].&lt;/ref&gt; Not far from the megalithic tomb are two round [[dolmen]]s, one of which is heavily deteriorated. Another megalithic passage grave is situated in the southwestern part of the woods. This tomb is known as ''Mor Gribs Hule'' (lit.: Mother Grib's Lair) and of similar age and origin as Jættestuen. Tradition says that the notorious sorceress Mother Grib lived in the grave chamber. She used to whistle at wayfarers, leading them astray to be robbed and killed by her sons &lt;ref&gt;A variant of the story says that Mother Grib led travellers astray when they asked her for directions, and by blowing a whistle she signalled her six strong sons to jump forward and attack the unlucky victims. As with most folk tales and [[word of mouth]] stories, various versions exist and change slightly over the years. ''Mor Grib'' is also known as ''Mutter Grib'', where Mutter translates as "old woman".&lt;/ref&gt; This story gives an entirely new meaning to the name of Gribskov.

Just northwest of Gribskov, the small woodland of Valby Hegn holds a total of seven [[long barrow]]s from the neolithic.

===Buildings===
Gribskov is cut through by the [[Gribskov Line]], an old [[railway line]] laid out in 1878, then offering the urban population a first-time opportunity to visit the forests.

Near the village of [[Nødebo]] at Lake Esrum in the southeastern part of the forest is ''[[Skovskolen]]'' (lit.: The Forest School), a large school situated in the old foresters lodge, ''Skovfryd'' (lit.: Forest-joy), from 1829-30. Here [[forest engineering|forest engineers]], [[landscape engineering|landscape engineers]] and [[nature guides]] are educated.

In the northeastern corner is the old [[Esrum Abbey]].

==Forestry and hunting==
[[File:Gribskov - map detail.JPG|thumb|Old map of the southern parts of Gribskov, highlighting the star-patterned hunting paths specifically. Made by J.G. von Langen in the 1760s.]]
Gribskov has a long tradition for [[forestry]] of all kinds.

In 1736, the German forester [[Johann Georg von Langen]] participated in restoring the Danish woodlands of the time by introducing [[European larch]]. Some of the first larch trees were planted in Gribskov in 1776 and they still can be seen there today in the northwestern parts, just east of [[Mårum]]. Known as ''Tinghuslærkene'' (lit.: The Tinghus-larches), one of the trees, now marked with a yellow ring and standing 36 m tall, was picked in 1935 by the Danish forestry geneticist [[Carl Syrach-Larsen]] for [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] experimentation. From the marked tree in Gribskov, he developed a very successful hybrid with [[Japanese larch]], able to withstand the devastating fungal [[Larch#Diseases|larch canker]] disease also known as ''Lachnellula willkommii''. The hybrids also had a faster and healthier growth. The hybrid is known as ''Larix × marschlinsii'' or ''L. × eurolepis'' (discouraged name) and can also occur spontaneously, wherever European and Japanese larch grow together.

Nowadays parts of Gribskov are used for seed production of species such as [[European spruce]].

The history of [[hunting]] in Gribskov also reaches far back in time. The most visible signs are perhaps the extensive path structures laid out in different parts of the forests, especially near Nødebo, in the years 1680–90 by [[King Christian V]]. These are long straight lines, usually designed in star-patterns, merging and radiating from strategical points. They were constructed and used for running up and tiring the game (usually deer) in so-called [[Medieval hunting#Quarry|parforce hunting]], by horse and packs of hunting dogs. The same kind of layout and design also can be seen in the nearby woodlands of [[Store Dyrehave]] and [[Jægersborg Dyrehave]], just south of Gribskov. They all are former royal game reserves. Gribskov still is used for hunting today—in particular [[deer]]—and some areas are not to be disturbed, but parforce hunting is illegal and has been since the year 1777.

[[File:Henry Hoyle Howorth, Vanity Fair, 1895-07-11.jpg|thumb|"a Lancashire Lad". Caricature by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] published in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]] in 1895.]]
'''Sir Henry Hoyle Howorth''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCIE|FRS}} (1 July 1842&amp;nbsp;– 15 July 1923) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician, [[barrister]] and amateur historian and geologist.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;''Obituary: Sir Henry Howorth, A Life of Wide Interests, Politics, Science, and Art'', The Times, 17 July 1923, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

He was born in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], the son of Henry Howorth, a merchant in that city. He was educated at [[Rossall School]] before studying law. He was called to the bar by the [[Inner Temple]] in 1867, and practised on the Northern Circuit.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was also the maternal great uncle of anthropologist [[Edmund Leach|Sir Edmund Ronald Leach]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

He was a [[British Unionism|Unionist]] in politics, and was elected as Conservative [[member of parliament]] for [[Salford South (UK Parliament constituency)|Salford South]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|1886]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was re-elected in [[United Kingdom general election, 1892|1892]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895]] before retiring from the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|Commons]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|1900 general election]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Apart from the law and politics, Howorth was deeply interested in [[archaeology]], history, [[numismatics]] and [[ethnography]]. He was a prolific writer, contributing articles to a number of journals.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1892 he was appointed a [[Order of the Indian Empire|Knight Commander of the Indian Empire]] in recognition of his works on the history and ethnography of Asia. In 1893 he was made a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], against considerable opposition{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} as he lacked any formal scientific education. He subsequently became Honorary Librarian of Chetham's College and a Trustee of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was also a Member of the [[Chetham Society]], serving as a Member of Council from 1877 until 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chethamsociety.org.uk/pdf/CS_Officers_Council.pdf |title=Chetham Society: Officers and Council |publisher=Chetham Society |date=2015-11-04 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howorth was a controversialist, frequently airing his opinions on the letters page of ''[[The Times]]'', sometimes under the pseudonym "A Manchester Conservative". He married Katherine Brierley in 1869 and they had three sons, one of whom was [[Rupert Howorth|Sir Rupert Howorth]]. His wife predeceased him in 1921. Sir Henry Howorth died in July 1923 aged 81, and was buried in [[Putney Vale Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Catastrophism==

Howorth rejected the [[uniformitarianism]] of [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]]. He attacked the [[ice age]] theory in his book ''The Mammoth and the Flood'' (1887). He defended a form of neo-[[diluvialism]], that catastrophic floods had devastated large areas of the earth.&lt;ref name="Kruger"&gt;Kruger, Tobias. (2013). ''Discovering the Ice Ages: International Reception and Consequences for a Historical Understanding of Climate''. Brill. pp. 282-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

He did not believe in a global flood and considered the biblical deluge just one of many [[flood myth]]s to support his theory. He used geological evidence to support his theory in ''The Glacial Nightmare and the Flood'' (1893). In 1905, he wrote another book ''Ice or Water'' that attempted to refute the glacial theory in detail. Professional geologists were not convinced by his theory.&lt;ref name="Kruger"/&gt;

The books he authored summarise his areas of interest:

The word '''[[energy]]''' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἐνέργεια'' (''energeia''), which appears for the first time in the work [[Nicomachean Ethics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0053:bekker%20page=1098a&amp;highlight=e%29ne%2Frgeia#note4 Aristotle, "Nicomachean Ethics", 1098a, at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt; of 4th century BCE.

[[File:Thomas Young (scientist).jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] - the first to use the term "energy" in the modern sense.]]
The concept of energy emerged from the idea of ''[[vis viva]]'' (living force), which [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total ''vis viva'' was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz claimed that heat consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter — a view shared by [[Isaac Newton]], although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted.

[[Émilie du Châtelet|Émilie marquise du Châtelet]] in her book Institutions de Physique ("Lessons in Physics"), published in 1740, incorporated the idea of Leibniz with practical observations of Gravesande to show that the "quantity of motion" of a moving object is proportional to its mass and its velocity squared (not the velocity itself as Newton taught—what was later called [[momentum]]).

In 1802 lectures to the Royal Society, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] was the first to use the term "energy" in its modern sense, instead of ''[[vis viva]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Crosbie | title = The Science of Energy - a Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain | publisher = [[The University of Chicago Press]] | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-226-76420-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1807 publication of those lectures, he wrote,

{{quote|The product of the mass of a body into the square of its velocity may properly be termed its energy.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Young (1807). ''A Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis]] described "[[kinetic energy]]" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]] coined the term "[[potential energy]]."

It was argued for some years whether energy was a substance (the [[caloric theory|caloric]]) or merely a physical quantity.

==Thermodynamics==

The development of [[steam engines]] required engineers to develop concepts and formulas that would allow them to describe the [[mechanical efficiency|mechanical]] and [[thermal efficiency|thermal efficiencies]] of their systems. Engineers such as [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], physicists such as [[James Prescott Joule]], mathematicians such as [[Émile Clapeyron]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], and amateurs such as [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] all contributed to the notion that the ability to perform certain tasks, called work, was somehow related to the amount of energy in the system. In the 1850s, Glasgow professor of natural philosophy [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] and his ally in the engineering science [[William Rankine]] began to replace the older language of [[mechanics]] with terms such as "actual energy", "[[kinetic energy]]", and "[[potential energy]]".&lt;ref name="Smith" &gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Crosbie | title = The Science of Energy - a Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-226-76421-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William Thomson ([[Lord Kelvin]]) amalgamated all of these laws into the laws of [[thermodynamics]], which aided in the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes using the concept of energy by [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] and [[Walther Nernst]]. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of [[entropy]] by Clausius, and to the introduction of laws of [[radiant energy]] by [[Jožef Stefan]].
Rankine, coined the term "potential energy".&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;  In 1881, William Thomson stated before an audience that:&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, William. (1881). "On the sources of energy available to man for the production of mechanical effect." ''BAAS Rep''. 51: 513-18 (Quote: pg. 513); ''PL 2'': 433-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The very name '''energy''', though first used in its present sense by Dr [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] about the beginning of this century, has only come into use practically after the [[History of thermodynamics|doctrine]] which defines it had ... been raised from mere formula of mathematical dynamics to the position it now holds of a principle pervading all nature and guiding the investigator in the field of science.}}

Over the following thirty years or so this newly developing science went by various names, such as the dynamical [[theory of heat]] or [[energetics]], but after the 1920s generally came to be known as [[thermodynamics]], the science of energy transformations.

Stemming from the 1850s development of the first two [[laws of thermodynamics]], the science of energy have since branched off into a number of various fields, such as [[biological thermodynamics]] and [[thermoeconomics]], to name a couple; as well as related terms such as [[entropy]], a measure of the loss of useful energy, or [[Power (physics)|power]], an energy flow per unit time, etc. In the past two centuries, the use of the word energy in various "non-scientific" vocations, e.g. social studies, spirituality and psychology has proliferated the popular literature.

==Conservation of energy==
In 1918 it was proved that the law of [[conservation of energy]] is the direct mathematical consequence of the [[translational]] [[symmetry]] of the quantity [[conjugate quantities|conjugate]] to energy, namely [[time]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  That is, energy is conserved because the laws of physics do not distinguish between different moments of time (see [[Noether's theorem]]).

During a 1961 lecture&lt;ref name="RPF1"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics; Volume 1|date=1964|publisher=[[Addison Wesley]]|location=U.S.A| isbn=0-201-02115-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; for undergraduate students at the [[California Institute of Technology]], [[Richard Feynman]], a celebrated physics teacher and [[Nobel Laureate]], said this about the concept of energy:

{{quote|There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law&amp;mdash;it is exact so far we know. The law is called [[conservation of energy]]; it states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy that does not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity, which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number, and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same.|''The Feynman Lectures on Physics''}}

'''Holy water''' is water that has been [[Blessing|blessed]] by a member of the [[clergy]] or a religious figure. The use for cleansing prior to a baptism and spiritual cleansing is common in several religions, from [[Christianity]] to [[Sikhism]]. The use of holy water as a [[sacramentals|sacramental]] for protection against evil is common among [[Anglican]]s, [[Roman Catholics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/ignatius/principles3.html|title=Tracts on Principles of Divine Worship: No. 3.

== In Christianity ==
{{see also|Water of lustration}}
In [[Catholicism]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and some other [[Christian Church|churches]], holy water is water that has been sanctified by a [[priest]] for the purpose of [[baptism]], the [[Blessing (Christianity)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers's encyclopædia, page 394, Published by Lippincott &amp; Co (1870)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Altman, 2002 ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life'' {{ISBN|1-58768-013-0}} pp 130–133&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
[[File:Holy water St Teresa's church Clarendon Street Dublin 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Take-home holy water at St Teresa's church, [[Dublin]]]]
The use of holy water used by various sects of Christianity is a  practice only attested to in Catholic documents. The [[Apostolic Constitutions]], which goes back to about the year 400, attribute the precept of using holy water to the [[Apostle Matthew]]. It is plausible that in earliest Christian times water was used for [[expiation|expiatory]] and [[ritual purification|purificatory]] purposes in a way analogous to [[Mikveh|its employment in Jewish Law]]. Yet, in many cases, the water used for the [[Sacrament]] of [[Baptism]] was flowing water, sea or river water, and it could not receive the same blessing as that contained in the baptisteries in the view of the Roman Catholic church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07432a.htm Catholic encyclopedia on Holy water]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eastern Orthodox do perform the same blessing, whether in a baptistry or an outdoor body of water.

=== Use and storage ===

Sprinkling with holy water is used as a [[Sacramentals|sacramental]] that recalls baptism.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Sacramentals,  [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P58.HTM  ss. 1667, 1668]&lt;/ref&gt; Holy water is kept in the [[holy water font]], which is typically located at the entrance to the church (or sometimes in a separate room or building called a [[baptistery]]). Smaller vessels, called [[stoups]], are usually placed at the entrances of the church, to enable people to sprinkle themselves with it on entering. In recent years, with the concerns over influenza, new holy water machines that work like an [[automatic soap dispenser]] have become popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hi-tech holy water calms flu fear|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8356019.stm|accessdate=17 May 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages the power of holy water was considered so great that in some places fonts had locked covers to prevent the theft of holy water for unauthorized [[Magic (paranormal)|magic practices]]. The Constitutions of [[Edmund Rich|Archbishop Edmund Rich]] (1236) prescribe that "Fonts are to be kept under lock and key, because of witchcraft (''sortilegia''). Similarly the [[chrism]] and sacred oil are kept locked up."&lt;ref&gt;''Fontes sub serura clausi teneantur, propter saortilegia. Chrisma similiter et oleum sacrum sub clave custodiantur" (Wilkinson, ''Consilia'', 1:636, quoted in [[George C. Homans]], ''English Villagers in the Thirteenth Century'', 2nd ed. 1991:384 and note 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proper disposal ===

In Catholicism, holy water, as well as water used during the washing of the priest's hands at mass, is not allowed to be disposed of in regular plumbing. Roman Catholic churches will usually have a special basin (a ''[[Sacrarium]]'') that leads directly into the ground for the purpose of proper disposal. A hinged lid is kept over the holy water basin to distinguish it from a regular sink basin, which is often just beside it. Items that contained holy water are separated, drained of the holy water, and then washed in a regular manner in the adjacent sink.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Theiler, 2003 Holy Water and Its Significance for Catholics {{ISBN|0-7661-7553-7}} p 48&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hygiene ===
Holy water fonts have been identified as a potential source of bacterial and viral infection. In the late 19th century, [[bacteriologist]]s found [[staphylococci]], [[streptococci]], [[escherichia coli|coli bacilli]], [[corynebacterium diphtheriae|Loeffler's bacillus]], and other bacteria in samples of holy water taken from a church in [[Sassari, Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Dietetic and Hygienic Gazette, Volume 14, page 578. The Gazette Publishing Company, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study performed in 1995, 13 samples were taken when a burn patient acquired a bacterial infection after exposure to holy water. The samples in that study were shown to have a "wide range of bacterial species", some of which could cause infection in humans.&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Rees and K.D. Allen, 1996 "Holy water—a risk factor for hospital-acquired infection". ''Journal of Hospital Infection'' 32(1), pages 51–55.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[swine flu]] epidemic of 2009, [[John Thomas Steinbock|Bishop John Steinbock]] of [[Fresno, California]] recommended that "holy water should not be in the fonts" due to fear of spreading infections.&lt;ref&gt;California Catholic Daily. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20120226133520/http://www.calcatholic.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?id=4646a566-ae6a-456c-8f28-0d47cb14d3ac Holy water should not be in fonts during this epidemic &lt;Internet&gt;]". 4 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in response to the swine flu, an automatic, motion-detecting holy water dispenser was invented and installed in an Italian church in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;NPR Morning Edition.

=== Christian traditions ===

==== Roman Catholics ====

===== Sanctification =====

As a reminder of baptism, Catholic Christians dip their fingers in the holy water and make the [[sign of the cross]] when entering the church. The liturgy may begin on Sundays with the [[Rite]] of Blessing and Sprinkling Holy Water, in which holy water is sprinkled upon the congregation; this is called ''aspersion'', from the Latin, ''[[asperges|aspergere]]'', to sprinkle. This ceremony dates back to the ninth century. An ''aspergill'' or ''[[aspergillum]]'' is a brush or branch used to sprinkle the water. An ''aspersorium'' is the vessel which holds the holy water and into which the aspergillum is dipped, though elaborate [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] examples are known as ''[[Situla (vessel)|situlae]]''. [[Blessed salt in Christianity|Blessed salt]] may be added to the water "where it is customary."

This use of holy water and making a sign of the cross when entering a church reflects a renewal of baptism, a cleansing of [[venial sin]], as well as providing protection against evil.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Bold, 2008 ''Catholic Doctrine and Discipline Simply Explained'' {{ISBN|1-4097-8610-2}} page 283&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes accompanied by the following prayer:&lt;ref&gt;Jacquelyn Lindsey, 2001 ''Catholic Family Prayer Book'' OSV Press {{ISBN|0-87973-999-1}} p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"By this Holy water and by your Precious Blood, wash away all my sins O Lord".}}

Although not actually holy water since it has not been blessed by a [[priest]], some Catholics believe that water from specific shrines, such as [[Lourdes]], can bring healing.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Clarke, 2008 ''Lourdes, Its Inhabitants, Its Pilgrims, And Its Miracles'' {{ISBN|1-4086-8541-8}} page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Formula =====
The traditional Latin formula for blessing the water is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Exorcizo te, creatura aquæ, in nomine Dei Patris omnipotentis, et in nomine Jesu Christi, Filii ejus Domini nostri, et in virtute Spiritus Sancti: ut fias aqua exorcizata ad effugandam omnem potestatem inimici, et ipsum inimicum eradicare et explantare valeas cum angelis suis apostaticis, per virtutem ejusdem Domini nostri Jesu Christ: qui venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos et sæculum per ignem. Deus, qui ad salutem humani generis maxima quæque sacramenta in aquarum substantia condidisti: adesto propitius invocationibus nostris, et elemento huic, multimodis purificationibus præparato, virtutem tuæ benedictionis infunde; ut creatura tua, mysteriis tuis serviens, ad abigendos dæmones morbosque pellendos divinæ gratiæ sumat effectum; ut quidquid in domibus vel in locis fidelium hæc unda resperserit careat omni immunditia, liberetur a noxa. Non illic resideat spiritus pestilens, non aura corrumpens: discedant omnes insidiæ latentis inimici; et si quid est quod aut incolumitati habitantium invidet aut quieti, aspersione hujus aquæ effugiat: ut salubritas, per invocationem sancti tui nominis expetita, ab omnibus sit impugnationibus defensa. Per Dominum, amen.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''English translation:'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;I exorcise thee, creature of water, in the name of God the Father almighty, in the name of Jesus Christ, his Son, our Lord, and in the power of the Holy Spirit, that you may put to flight all the power of the enemy, and that enemy and to root out and, along with his fallen angels through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall come to judge the living and the dead and the world by fire. O God, who for the salvation of the human race has built Thy greatest mysteries in the substance, in your kindness hear our prayers, and with the element to this, for many kinds of purifications of his well-prepared, the power of Thy blessing, Serve it; the creation of Thy mysteries, serving as an agent of divine grace; is sprinkled with this water in their houses or in the buildings of the faithful, that whatever might be free from all uncleanness, he is freed from every harm. It is not no pestilent spirit, no taint of corruption; let all the wiles of the lurking enemy; or to provide for the safety and peace of the inhabitants of that which is, and if there be any, by the sprinkling of this water, so that health, through the invocation of Thy holy name, made secure against all attacks. Through the end.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===== Protection against evil =====
[[File:Teresa of Avila dsc01644.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Teresa of Avila]], by [[Rubens]], 1615]]

Catholic saints have written about the power of holy water as a force that repels evil. Saint [[Teresa of Avila]], a [[Doctor of the Church]] who reported [[visions of Jesus and Mary]], was a strong believer in the power of holy water and wrote that she used it with success to repel evil and temptations.&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bielecki, Mirabai Starr, 2008 ''Teresa of Avila: The Book of My Life'' {{ISBN|1-59030-573-6}} pp 238–241&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote:
{{quote|"I know by frequent experience that there is nothing which puts the devils to flight like Holy water."&lt;ref&gt;Teresa of Avila, 2008 ''Life of St. Teresa of Jesus'' {{ISBN|1-60680-041-8}} page 246&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Holy Water and Its Significance for Catholics'' Henry Theiler states that in addition to being a strong force in repelling evil, holy water has the twofold benefit of providing [[grace (Christianity)|grace]] for both body and soul.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Theiler, 2003 ''Holy Water and Its Significance for Catholics'' {{ISBN|0-7661-7553-7}} pp 24–31&lt;/ref&gt;

The new ''[[Rituale Romanum]]'' excludes the [[exorcism]] prayer on the water. Exorcized salt used to be added to the holy Water as well. Priests can now use the older form if they wish according to ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'', an apostolic letter by Pope Benedict XVI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extraordinary Form; Book of Blessings|author=Legionary of Christ Father Edward McNamara|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur336.htm|publisher=ZENIT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eastern Christians ====
{{Main|Holy water in Eastern Christianity}}
[[File:The consecration of water on the Theophany. Kustodiev.jpg|thumb|right|''Great Blessing of Waters'' by [[Boris Kustodiev]]]]
[[File:Esphigmenou.procession for Little Blessing of Waters.jpeg|thumb|right|Procession for the Lesser Blessing of Waters]]

Among the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and the [[Byzantine Rite]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Catholics]] holy water is used frequently in rites of [[blessing]] and [[exorcism]], and the water for baptism is always sanctified with a special blessing.

There are two rites for blessing holy water: the "Great Blessing of Waters" which is held on the [[Great Feasts|Feast]] of [[Theophany]] and at baptisms, and the "Lesser Blessing of Waters" which is conducted according to need and local custom during the rest of the year, certain feast days calling for the Lesser Blessing of Waters as part of their liturgical observance. Both forms are based upon the Rite of Baptism. After the blessing of holy water the faithful are sprinkled with it and each drinks some of it.

Holy water is drunk by the faithful after it is blessed and it is a common custom for the pious to drink holy water every morning. In the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]] holy water is always drunk in conjunction with consuming [[antidoron]]. Eastern Orthodox do not typically bless themselves with holy water upon entering a church as Western Catholics do, but a quantity of holy water is often kept in a [[baptismal font|font]] placed in the [[narthex]] (entrance) of the church, available for anyone who would like to partake of it or to take some of it home.

After the annual Great Blessing of Waters at [[Theophany]] (also known as [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]), the priest goes to the homes of the faithful within his parish and, in predominantly Orthodox lands, to the buildings throughout town, and blesses them with holy water.

When blessing objects such as the palms on [[Palm Sunday]], [[Easter eggs|Paschal eggs]] and other foods for [[Easter]], candles, or liturgical instruments and sacred vessels ([[icon]]s and crosses are not blessed, however, as they are considered intrinsically holy and redeemed). The blessing is completed by a triple sprinkling with holy water using the words, "This (''name of item'') is blessed by the sprinkling of this holy water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."

Throughout the centuries, there have been many springs of water that have been believed by members of the Orthodox Church to be miraculous. Some still flow, such as the one at [[Pochaev Lavra]] in [[Ukraine]], and the Life-Giving Spring of the [[Theotokos]] in [[Constantinople]] (commemorated on [[Easter Friday|Bright Friday]]).

==== {{anchor|Sanctified water}} Anglicans ====

''Holy water'' is not a term used in [[Church of England]] rites, although font water is sanctified in the Church of England baptism rite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/worship/liturgy/commonworship/texts/initiation/baptism.html Church of England Rite of Holy Baptism, The Archbishops' Council of the Church of England, 2000–2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]] does expressly mention the optional use of holy water in some recent liturgies of blessing.&lt;ref&gt;Enriching Our Worship 5: Liturgies and Prayers Related to Childbearing, Childbirth, and Loss; Church Publishing; 2009; p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the use of water within [[High Church]] Anglicanism or [[Anglo-Catholicism]] adheres closely to Roman Catholic practice. In many such Anglican churches baptismal water is used for the [[asperges]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Anglican_Service_Book/vidi.html Anglican Service Book]&lt;/ref&gt; Stoups with sanctified water are sometimes found near the doors of High Church Anglican churches for the faithful to use in making the [[sign of the cross]] upon entering the [[Church (building)|church]].

==== Lutherans ====

The use of holy water in some synods of [[Lutheranism]] is for the [[baptism]] of infants and new members of the church. The water is believed to be blessed by God, as it is used in a [[sacrament]]. The water is applied to the forehead of the laity being baptised and the minister performs the [[sign of the cross]]. Lutherans tend to have holy water fonts at the entrance of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stjamessumter.org/Newsletters/Newsletter0213.pdf|title=Where is the Baptismal Font?|last=Getz|first=Keith|date=February 2013|publisher=Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|accessdate=5 May 2014|quote=By having the font at the entrance of the church, and using the font every Sunday, we are intentionally and dramatically revealing the importance of Holy Baptism and highlighting it as foundational to our life in Christ. It symbolically reminds us that we enter into the life of the church, into the life of Christ’s body, through the birthing waters of the baptismal font, where we are born again from above. Dipping our fingers in the holy water of the font and making the sign of the cross, reinforces who and whose we are. We are reminded that we have been baptized; daily we die to sin and rise to new life in the Spirit. The font is also positioned so that from the font there is a direct and central path leading to the altar, highlighting how these two Holy Sacraments are intimately connected. As we leave the church, we see the baptismal font, reminding us that we have been baptized, named and claimed, to serve others in proclamation and service to others.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other synods do not use holy water, however they do typically treat the water used for baptisms in a more respectful manner.

==== Methodists ====
In the Methodist tradition, Holy Baptism is often administered by sprinkling or pouring holy water over the candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baptism|last=Hannon|first=Dan|year=2014|work=Life Events|publisher=The United Methodist Church|accessdate=5 May 2014|quote=Holy Baptism is a Covenant between an individual and God. It is God’s word to us, proclaiming our adoption by grace and our word to God, promising our response of faith and love. Persons of all ages can be baptized at Christ Church. We baptize by sprinkling Holy Water. The United Methodist Church recognizes baptisms from other denominations and churches and therefore does not “re-baptize”.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Baptismal Liturgy, as well as the liturgy for Reaffirmation of Baptism commonly done through asperges, has a prayer for the blessing of this water:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This is your Baptismal Liturgy: A Resource for Understanding The United Methodist Ritual of Holy Baptism|year=2001|publisher=The United Methodist Church|accessdate=5 May 2014|quote=Holy Spirit is invoked to bless and use the water, in anticipation that God will act again, even now.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Pour out your Holy Spirit, to bless this gift of water and those who receive it, to wash away their sin and clothe them in righteousness throughout their lives, that, dying and being raised with Christ, they may share in his final victory. All praise to you, Eternal Father, through your Son Jesus Christ, who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns for ever. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This is your Baptismal Liturgy: A Resource for Understanding The United Methodist Ritual of Holy Baptism|year=2001|publisher=The United Methodist Church|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Hindu public prayer in Haridwar.jpg|thumb|A [[Hindu]] public prayer in the [[River Ganges]]]]

In [[Ancient Greek religion]], holy water called ''chernips'' ({{Lang-el|χέρνιψ}}) was created when a torch from a religious shrine was extinguished in it. In Greek religion, purifying people and locations with water was part of the process of distinguishing the [[Sacred–profane dichotomy|sacred from the profane]].&lt;ref&gt;''Greek religion: archaic and classical'', by Walter Burkert, John Raffan 1991 {{ISBN|0-631-15624-0}} page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Numbers]] mentions using water in a test for the purity of a wife accused of marital infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Numbers|5:12–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as [[Ordeal of the bitter water|the Ordeal of the Bitter Water]], the accused woman ([[Sotah (Talmud)|sotah]]) would first be asked to confess to her crime before the court. If she refused to confess, she would then undergo the ritual. She would be stripped naked and then drink a mixture of water and dust. If she was guilty, she would be supposedly cursed to miscarry any pregnancy, though the text is unclear on the exact punishment. If she was innocent, there would be no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYHNaY1oXQQC&amp;pg=PA186 |page=186 |title=Women and Jewish Law: The Essential Texts, Their History, and Their Relevance for Today |last=Biale |first=Rachel |publisher=Random House Digital |year=1995 |isbn=0805210490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sikh]]s use the [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] term ''amrita'' (ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ) for the holy water used in the [[baptism]] ceremony known as ''[[Amrit Sanskar]]'' or ''Amrit Chhakhna''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sikhism'', 2004, by Geoff Teece {{ISBN|1-58340-469-4}} page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hinduism, water represents God in a spiritual sense which is the central theme in [[Mantra Pushpam]] from Taithreeya Aranyakam of [[Yajur Veda]]. Bathing in holy water is, thus, a key element in [[Hinduism]], and the [[Ganges]] is considered the holiest Hindu river.&lt;ref&gt;''Hinduism'', 2004, by Geoff Teece {{ISBN|1-58340-466-X}} page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of "blessed water" is used in virtually all [[Buddhist]] traditions. In the [[Theravada]] tradition, water is put into a new pot and kept near a ''Paritrana'' ceremony, a blessing for protection. This "lustral water" can be created in a ceremony in which the burning and extinction of a candle above the water represents the [[Classical element|element]]s of earth, fire, and air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thailandlife.com/lustralwater.htm|title=Buddhism in Thailand: Lustral Water}}&lt;/ref&gt; This water is later given to the people to be kept in their home. Not only water but also oil and strings are blessed in this ceremony. Most [[Mahayana]] Buddhists typically recite sutras or various mantras (typically that of the bodhisattva [[Avalokitesvara]] for example) numerous times over the water, which is then either consumed or is used to bless homes afterwards. In Vajrayana Buddhism, a ''[[Bumpa]]'', a ritual object, is one of the ''[[Ashtamangala]]'', used for storing sacred water sometimes, symbolizing wisdom and long life.&lt;ref name="brsk"&gt;{{cite web | last =Smithsonian Institution | first = | title =Buddhist ritual sprinkler (kundika) &lt;Internet&gt; | url =http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=4442 | accessdate =16 July 2007 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070621094614/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=4442 | archivedate =21 June 2007 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skws"&gt;{{cite web|last=The British Museum |first= |title=Stoneware kundika (water sprinkler) &lt;Internet&gt; |url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/s/stoneware_kundika_water_sprin.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194709/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/s/stoneware_kundika_water_sprin.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 September 2007 |accessdate=16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] variety of holy water is the [[Zamzam Well|Zamzam]] water that comes from a spring by The [[Kaaba]].

The drinking of "healing water" (''āb-i shifā'') is a practice in various denominations of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name="ViraniShafique"&gt;Virani, Shafique. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt; In the tradition of the [[Ithna Ashari|Twelver Shi’a]], many dissolve the dust of sacred locations such as [[Karbala]] (''khāk-i shifa'') and [[Najaf]] and drink the water (''āb-i shifā'') as a cure for illness, both spiritual and physical.&lt;ref name="ViraniShafique" /&gt; The [[Ismaili]] tradition involves the practice of drinking water blessed by the [[Imam]] of the time. This water is taken in the name of the Imam and has a deep spiritual significance. This is evident from the names used to designate the water, including light (''nūr'') and [[ambrosia]] (''amṛt, amī, amīras, amījal''). This practice is recorded from the 13th and 14th centuries and continues to the present day. The ceremony is known as ''ghat-pat'' in South Asia.&lt;ref name="ViraniShafique" /&gt;

In [[Wicca]] and other [[ceremonial magic]] traditions, a bowl of [[salt]] is blessed and a small amount is stirred into a bowl of water that has been ritually purified. In some traditions of Wicca, this mixture of water and salt symbolizes the brine of the sea, which is regarded as the womb of the Goddess, and the source of all life on Earth. The mixture is consecrated and used in many religious ceremonies and magical [[rituals]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wicca for Life: The Way of the Craft -- From Birth to Summerland'', 2003, by Raymond Buckland {{ISBN|0-8065-2455-3}} page 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Holy water has also been believed to ward off or act as a weapon against mythical evil creatures, such as [[vampire]]s.

The '''indirect land use change impacts of [[biofuels]]''', also known as '''ILUC''', relates to the unintended consequence of releasing more [[carbon emissions]] due to [[Land use, land-use change and forestry|land-use changes]] around the world induced by the expansion of croplands for [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] or [[biodiesel]] production in response to the increased global demand for biofuels.&lt;ref name=Searchinger0208/&gt;&lt;ref name=WangLetScie/&gt;

As farmers worldwide respond to higher crop prices in order to maintain the global food supply-and-demand balance, pristine lands are cleared to replace the food crops that were diverted elsewhere to [[biofuels' production]]. Because natural lands, such as [[rainforest]]s and [[grassland]]s, store carbon in their soil and [[biomass]] as plants grow each year, clearance of wilderness for new farms translates to a net increase in [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. Due to this change in the [[carbon stock]] of the soil and the biomass, indirect land use change has consequences in the [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) balance of a biofuel.&lt;ref name=Searchinger0208/&gt;&lt;ref name=WangLetScie/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lausanne&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/121496/files/ |format=PDF|title=Accounting for indirect land-use changes in GHG balances of biofuels: Review of current approaches|author=Gnansounou|publisher=[[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] |date=March 2008|accessdate=2009-06-07|display-authors=etal}} Working Paper REF. 437.101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OpedFarrel/&gt;

==History==
The estimates of [[carbon intensity]] for a given biofuel depend on the assumptions regarding several variables. As of 2008, multiple [[Life cycle assessment|full life cycle]] studies had found that [[Ethanol fuel in the United States|corn ethanol]], [[cellulosic ethanol]] and [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazilian sugarcane ethanol]] produce lower greenhouse gas emissions than [[gasoline]].&lt;ref name=Farrel2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=USEthanol/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wang2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wang205ppt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MLA04/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKRTFO/&gt; None of these studies, however, considered the effects of indirect land-use changes, and though land use impacts were acknowledged, estimation was considered too complex and difficult to model.&lt;ref name=WangLetScie/&gt;&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt; A controversial paper published in February 2008 in [[Science (journal)|Sciencexpress]] by a team led by Searchinger from [[Princeton University]] concluded that such effects offset the (positive) direct effects of both corn and cellulosic ethanol and that Brazilian sugarcane performed better, but still resulted in a small carbon debt.&lt;ref name=Searchinger0208&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1151861|title=Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases Through Emissions from Land-Use Change|author=Timothy Searchinger|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=319 |issue=5867 |pages=1238–1240 | doi=10.1126/science.1151861 |date=2008-02-29|accessdate=2008-05-09|pmid=18258860|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2008Sci...319.1238S}} ''Originally published online in Science Express on 7 February 2008 available [http://www.princeton.edu/~tsearchi/writings/Searchinger_et_al-ScienceExpress.pdf here]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UK]] [[Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation]] program requires the [[Renewable Fuels Agency]] (RFA) to report potential indirect impacts of biofuel production, including indirect land use change or changes to food and other commodity prices.&lt;ref name="UKRTFO"/&gt; A July 2008 RFA study, known as the Gallager Review, found several risks and uncertainties, and that the "quantification of GHG emissions from indirect land-use change requires subjective assumptions and contains considerable uncertainty", and required further examination to properly incorporate indirect effects into calculation methodologies.&lt;ref name=Gallagher0708&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewablefuelsagency.org/_db/_documents/Report_of_the_Gallagher_review.pdf |title=The Gallagher Review of the indirect effects of biofuels production |publisher=[[Renewable Fuels Agency]] |author=Ed Gallagher |date=July 2008 |accessdate=2009-06-09}} ''See Chapter 2: The effect of land-use change on GHG savings from biofuels''.&lt;/ref&gt; A similarly cautious approach was followed by the [[European Union]]. In December 2008 the [[European Parliament]] adopted more stringent sustainability criteria for biofuels and directed the [[European Commission]] to develop a methodology to factor in GHG emissions from indirect land use change.&lt;ref name=EU08/&gt;

===Searchinger and Fargione studies===
In 2008 Timothy Searchinger, a [[lawyer]] from [[Environmental Defense Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.princeton.edu/~tsearchi/ | title=Timothy D. Searchinger | accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that ILUC affects the [[life cycle assessment]] and that instead of saving, both corn and cellulosic ethanol increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively. Ethanol from Brazilian sugarcane performed better, recovering initial carbon emissions in 4 years, while U.S. corn ethanol required 167 years and cellulosic ethanol required a 52 years payback period.&lt;ref name=Searchinger0208/&gt; The study limited the analysis a 30-year period, assuming that [[land conversion]] emits 25 percent of the carbon stored in soils and all carbon in plants cleared for cultivation. Brazil, [[China]], and [[India]] were considered among the overseas locations where land use change would occur as a result of diverting U.S. corn cropland, and it was assumed that new cropland in each of these regions correspond to different types of [[forest]], [[savanna]] or [[grassland]] based on the historical proportion of each converted to cultivation in these countries during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Searchinger0208/&gt;

Fargione and his team published a separate paper in the same issue of Sciencexpress claiming that clearing lands to produce biofuel feedstock created a carbon deficit. This deficit applies to both direct and indirect land use changes. The study examined six conversion scenarios: [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] to [[soybean]] [[biodiesel]], Brazilian [[Cerrado]] to soybean biodiesel, Brazilian Cerrado to sugarcane ethanol, [[Indonesia]]n or [[Malaysia]]n lowland [[tropical rainforest]] to [[oil palm|palm]] biodiesel, Indonesian or Malaysian [[peatland]] tropical rainforest to palm biodiesel, and U.S. Central [[grassland]] to corn ethanol.&lt;ref name=Fargione08&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1152747 |title=Land Clearing and the Biofuel Carbon Debt |author=Fargione |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=319 |issue=5867 |pages=1235–1238 |date=2008-02-29 |accessdate=2009-06-09|language=|doi= 10.1126/science.1152747|pmid= 18258862|last2= Hill|first2= J|last3= Tilman|first3= D|last4= Polasky|first4= S|last5= Hawthorne|first5= P|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2008Sci...319.1235F}} ''Originally published online in Science Express on 7 February 2008, available [http://www.nature.org/initiatives/climatechange/files/land_clearing_and_the_biofuel_carbon_debt.pdf here]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon debt was defined as the amount of {{CO2}} released during the first 50 years of this process of land conversion. For the two most common ethanol feedstocks, the study found that sugarcane ethanol produced on natural cerrado lands would take about 17 years to repay its carbon debt, while corn ethanol produced on U.S. central grasslands would result in a repayment time of about 93 years. The worst-case scenario is converting Indonesian or Malaysian tropical peatland rainforest to palm biodiesel production, which would require about 420 years to repay.&lt;ref name=Fargione08/&gt;

====Criticism and controversy====
The Searchinger and Fargione studies created controversy in both the [[mass media|popular media]]&lt;ref name=OpedFarrel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time0208/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time0308/&gt;&lt;ref name=DebateTime/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1108/&gt;&lt;ref name=RFA1108/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ1108/&gt; and in [[scientific journal]]s. [[Robert Zubrin]] observed that Searchinger's "indirect analysis" approach is [[pseudo-science|pseudo-scientific]] and can be used to "prove anything".&lt;ref&gt;''"For example, using Searchinger’s “indirect analysis” approach you can “prove” that increasing the mileage standards for vehicles contributes to global warming. Consider: Every gallon of gasoline not used by a motorist saves him $3.50 at today’s prices. He can use that money to buy other things. For example, at current prices (about $80 per ton), $3.50 could buy him about 90 pounds of coal. Burning that coal would obviously produce far more carbon dioxide emissions than burning the 6 pounds of carbon in one gallon of gas. So higher mileage standards for cars cause global warming. Q.E.D."'', in: {{cite book | title=Merchants of Despair: Radical Environmentalists, Criminal Pseudo-Scientists, and the Fatal Cult of Antihumanism | publisher=New Atlantis Books | author=Zubrin, Robert | year=2012 | isbn=978-1594034763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wang and Haq from Argonne National Laboratory claiming:  the assumptions were outdated; they ignored the potential of increased efficiency; and no evidence showed that "U.S. corn ethanol production has so far caused indirect land use in other countries." They concluded that Searchinger demonstrated that ILUC "is much more difficult to model than direct land use changes".&lt;ref name=WangLetScie/&gt; In his response Searchinger rebutted each technical objection and asserted that "... any calculation that ignores these emissions, however challenging it is to predict them with certainty, is too incomplete to provide a basis for policy decisions."&lt;ref name=SearchingResponse/&gt;&lt;ref name=SearchingNFAResponse/&gt;

Another criticism, by Kline and Dale from [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], held that Searchinger et al. and Fargione et al. "... do not provide adequate support for their claim that bioufuels cause high emissions due to land-use change", as their conclusions depends on a misleading assumption because more comprehensive field research found that these land use changes "... are driven by interactions among cultural, technological, biophysical, economic, and demographic forces within a spatial and temporal context rather than by a single crop market".&lt;ref name=ORNLletter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/v41_3_08/ScienceMag_Kline_Dale_a06_080711.pdf|format=PDF|title=Biofuels: Effects on Land and Fire|publisher=[[Science (journal)|Letters to Science]]|date=2008-07-11|accessdate=2009-06-11|author1=Keith L. Kline |author2=Virginia H. Dale }} This reference also includes Timothy Searching and Joseph Fargione responses to Kline and Dale (''Science Vol 321'').&lt;/ref&gt; Fargione et al. responded in part that although many factors contributed to land clearing, this "observation does not diminish the fact that biofuels also contribute to land clearing if they are produced on existing cropland or on newly cleared lands". Searching disagreed with all of Kline and Dale arguments.&lt;ref name=ORNLletter/&gt;

The U.S. biofuel industry also reacted, claiming that the "Searchinger study is clearly a 'worst case scenario' analysis ..." and that this study "relies on a long series of highly subjective assumptions ..."&lt;ref name=NFAResponse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethanolrfa.org/objects/documents/1522/response_to_science_articles_on_biofuels_-_new_fuels_alliance.pdf |format=pdf |title=Statement in Response to Science Articles on Biofuels |author=New Fuels Alliance |publisher=Renewable Fuels Association |accessdate=2009-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727023157/http://www.ethanolrfa.org/objects/documents/1522/response_to_science_articles_on_biofuels_-_new_fuels_alliance.pdf |archivedate=July 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Searchinger rebutted each claim, concluding that NFA's criticisms were invalid. He noted that even if some of his assumptions are high estimates, the study also made many conservative assumptions.&lt;ref name=SearchingNFAResponse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioenergywiki.net/images/3/31/Searchinger_Response.pdf |title=Response to New Fuels Alliance and DOE Analysts Criticisms of Science Studies of Greenhouse Gases and Biofuels|author=Timothy Searchinger|publisher=[[BioenergyWiki]]|date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
In February 2010, Lapola estimated that planned expansion of Brazilian sugarcane and soybean biofuel plantations through 2020 would replace [[rangeland]], with  small direct land-use impact on carbon emissions.&lt;ref name=Lapola2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mongabay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2010/0208-amazon_biofuels.html|title=Amazon rainforest will bear cost of biofuel policies in Brazil|publisher=Mongabay.com|author=Rhett A. Butler|date=2010-02-08|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the expansion of the rangeland frontier into Amazonian forests, driven by cattle ranching, would indirectly offset the savings.&lt;ref name=Mongabay/&gt; "Sugarcane ethanol and soybean biodiesel each contribute to nearly half of the projected indirect deforestation of 121,970 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by 2020, creating a carbon debt that would take about 250 years to be repaid...."&lt;ref name=Lapola2010/&gt;

The research also found that [[oil palm]] would cause the least land-use changes and associated carbon debt. The analysis also modeled livestock density increases and found that "a higher increase of 0.13 head per hectare in the average livestock density throughout the country could avoid the indirect land-use changes caused by biofuels (even with soybean as the biodiesel feedstock), while still fulfilling all food and bioenergy demands."&lt;ref name=Lapola2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mongabay/&gt; The authors conclude that intensification of cattle ranching and concentration on oil palm are required to achieve effective carbon savings, recommending closer collaboration between the biofuel and cattle-ranching sectors.&lt;ref name=Lapola2010&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/02/02/0907318107.abstract|title=Indirect land-use changes can overcome carbon savings from biofuels in Brazil|author=Lapola |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] | volume= 107|issue= 8|pages= 3388–93|date=2010-02-08|accessdate=2010-02-09|language=|doi= 10.1073/pnas.0907318107|pmid=20142492|last2=Schaldach|first2=R|last3=Alcamo|first3=J|last4=Bondeau|first4=A|last5=Koch|first5=J|last6=Koelking|first6=C|last7=Priess|first7=JA|pmc=2840431|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2010PNAS..107.3388L}}. Published online before print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mongabay/&gt;

The main [[UNICA, Brazil|Brazilian ethanol industry organization]] (UNICA) commented that such studies missed the continuing intensification of cattle production already underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2010/02/08/do-brazils-biofuels-have-land-use-issue/ |title=Brazil biofuels' land-use issue |author=Philip Brasher |newspaper=[[Des Moines Register]] |date=2010-02-08- |accessdate=2010-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516085121/http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2010/02/08/do-brazils-biofuels-have-land-use-issue/ |archivedate=2016-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Arima ''et al.'' published in May 2011 used spatial regression modeling to provide the first statistical assessment of ILUC for the Brazilian Amazon due to [[soy]] production. Previously, the indirect impacts of soy crops were only anecdotal or analyzed through demand models at a global scale, while the study took a regional approach. The analysis showed a strong signal linking the expansion of soybean fields in settled agricultural areas at the southern and eastern rims of the Amazon basin to pasture encroachments for cattle production on the forest frontier. The results demonstrate the need to include ILUC in measuring the [[carbon footprint]] of soy crops, whether produced for biofuels or other end-uses.&lt;ref name=Arima&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statistical Confirmation of Indirect Land Use Change in the Brazilian Amazon|author=Arima, E., Richards, P., Walker, R. and Caldas, M. M.|journal=[[Environmental Research Letters]]|volume=6 |issue=1498 |pages=1747–1752 |date=2011-05-24|language=|doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/6/2/024010|bibcode=2011ERL.....6b4010A}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2011-11-27--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arima study is based on 761 municipalities located in the [[Amazônia Legal|Legal Amazon of Brazil]], and found that between 2003 and 2008, soybean areas expanded by 39,100&amp;nbsp;km² in the basin's agricultural areas, mainly in [[Mato Grosso]]. The model showed that a 10% (3,910&amp;nbsp;km²) reduction of soy in old pasture areas would have led to a reduction in deforestation of up to 40% (26,039&amp;nbsp;km²) in heavily forested municipalities of the Brazilian Amazon. The analysis showed that the displacement of cattle production due to [[agricultural expansion]] drives land use change in municipalities located hundreds of kilometers away, and that the Amazonian ILUC is not only measurable but its impact is significant.&lt;ref name=Arima/&gt;

=====Controversy=====
The public consultation process before the ruling, and the ruling itself were controversial, yielding 229 comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/lispub/comm/bccommlog.php?listname=lcfs09|title=Comment Log for Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS09) |publisher=[[California Air Resources Board]] |accessdate=2009-04-28}} ''All letters and attachments are posted for public view of this site''.&lt;/ref&gt; ILUC was one of the most contentious issues. On June 24, 2008, 27 scientists and researchers submitted a letter saying, "As researchers and scientists in the field of biomass to biofuel conversion, we are convinced that there simply is not enough hard empirical data to base any sound policy regulation in regards to the indirect impacts of renewable biofuels production.

On the other side, more than 170 scientists and economists urged that CARB, "include indirect land use change in the lifecycle analyses of heat-trapping emissions from biofuels and other transportation fuels.

The [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] (EISA) established new renewable fuel categories and eligibility requirements, setting mandatory [[life cycle assessment|lifecycle]] emissions limits.&lt;ref name=EPAdraft/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA0509/&gt; EISA explicitly mandated EPA to include "direct emissions and significant indirect emissions such as significant emissions from land use changes."&lt;ref name=EPAdraft/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA0509/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0509&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/05/epa-nprm-20090505.html|title=EPA Proposes New Regulations for Renewable Fuel Standard to Implement Requirements of EISA; GHG Reduction and Indirect Land Use Change Effects Included|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]] |date=2009-05-05|accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EISA required a 20% reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions for any fuel produced at  facilities that commenced construction after December 19, 2007 to be classified as a "renewable fuel"; a 50% reduction for fuels to be classified as "biomass-based diesel" or "advanced biofuel", and a 60% reduction to be classified as "cellulosic biofuel". EISA provided limited flexibility to adjust these thresholds downward by up to 10 percent, and EPA proposed this adjustment for the advanced biofuels category. Existing plants were [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in.&lt;ref name=EPAdraft/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA0509/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0509/&gt;

On May 5, 2009, EPA released a [[notice of proposed rulemaking]] for implementation of the 2007 modification of the [[Renewable Fuel Standard]], known as RFS2.&lt;ref name=GCC0509/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPAproposal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/renewablefuels/#regulations |title=Renewable Fuel Standard Program (RFS2): Notice of Proposed Rulemaking |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] |date=May 2009|accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draft of the regulations was released for public comment during a 60-day period, a public hearing was held on 9 June 2009, and also a workshop was conducted on 10–11 June 2009.&lt;ref name=EPA0509&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/OMS/renewablefuels/420f09023.htm|title=EPA Proposes New Regulations for the National Renewable Fuel Standard Program for 2010 and Beyond|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0509/&gt;

EPA's draft analysis stated that ILUC can produce significant near-term GHG emissions due to land conversion, but that biofuels can pay these back over subsequent years. EPA highlighted two  scenarios, varying the time horizon and the [[discounted cash flow|discount rate]] for valuing emissions. The first assumed a 30-year time period uses a 0 percent discount rate (valuing emissions equally regardless of timing). The second scenario used a 100-year time period and a 2% discount rate.&lt;ref name=EPAdraft/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA0509/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0509/&gt;

On the same day that EPA published its notice of proposed rulemaking, President Obama signed a [[Presidential Directive]] seeking to advance biofuels research and commercialization. The Directive established the Biofuels Interagency Working Group, to develop policy ideas for increasing investment in next-generation fuels and for reducing their environmental footprint.&lt;ref name="LAT0609"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WH0509"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-Steps-to-Support-Sustainable-Energy-Options/|publisher=[[The White House]]|title=President Obama Announces Steps to Support Sustainable Energy Options, Departments of Agriculture and Energy, Environmental Protection Agency to Lead Efforts|date=2009-05-05|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT0509"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/white-house-steps-up-support-for-biofuels/ |title=White House Steps Up Support for Biofuels |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2009-05-05 |author= Matthew L.

On February 3, 2010, EPA issued its final RFS2 rule for 2010 and beyond.&lt;ref name=EPARuling&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/OMS/renewablefuels/|title=Renewable Fuel Standard Program (RFS2): Final Rule|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=2010-02-03|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule incorporated direct and significant indirect emissions including ILUC.

EPA's analysis accepted both [[Ethanol fuel in the United States|ethanol produced from corn starch]] and [[Butanol fuel|biobutanol]] from corn starch as "renewable fuels". [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Ethanol produced from sugarcane]] became an "advanced fuel". Both [[Green diesel|diesel produced from algal oils]] and [[biodiesel]] from soy oil and diesel from waste oils, fats, and greases fell in the "biomass-based diesel" category. [[Cellulosic ethanol]] and cellulosic diesel met the "cellulosic biofuel" standard.&lt;ref name=EPA2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/OMS/renewablefuels/420f10007.htm#7|title=Greenhouse Gas Reduction Thresholds|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=2010-02-03|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Reactions=====
UNICA welcomed the ruling, in particular, for the more precise lifecycle emissions estimate and  hoped that classification the advanced biofuel designation would help eliminate the tariff.&lt;ref name=UNICA022010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unica.com.br/noticias/show.asp?nwsCode={BF4E1F8C-A8C0-4E1A-A0F0-208D2513D8DE}|title=Agência ambiental dos EUA reconhece etanol de cana como biocombustível avançado |publisher=[[UNICA, Brazil|UNICA]]|language=Portuguese|date=2010-02-03|accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domesticfuel.com/2010/02/04/epa-deems-sugarcane-ethanol-an-advanced-biofuel/|title=EPA Deems Sugarcane Ethanol an Advanced Biofuel|publisher=DOMESTICFUEL.com|date=2010-02-04|accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Renewable Fuels Association]] (RFA) also welcomed the ruling, as ethanol producers "require stable federal policy that provides them the market assurances they need to commercialize new technologies", restating their ILUC objection.&lt;ref name=RFA012010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renewablefuelsassociation.cmail1.com/T/ViewEmail/y/78B3C6C380747C63|title=RFS Rules "Workable" - ILUC Inclusion Still Problematic|publisher=[[Renewable Fuels Association]]|date=2010-02-03|accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RFA also complained that corn-based ethanol scored only a 21% reduction, noting that without ILUC, corn ethanol achieves a 52% GHG reduction.&lt;ref name=RFA012010/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTEPA010&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/02/04/04greenwire-new-biofuels-regs-could-still-face-fight-from-80948.html?emc=eta1|title=New Biofuels Regs Could Still Face Fight From Capitol Hill|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=Allison Winter|date=2010-02-04|accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; RFA also objected that Brazilian sugarcane ethanol "benefited disproportionally"&lt;!--disproportionATEly?--&gt; because EPA's revisions lowered the initially equal ILUC estimates by half for corn and 93% for sugarcane.&lt;ref name=RFA022010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethanolrfa.org/objects/documents/2769/rfs2_rule_summary_brief.pdf |title=Issue Brief: Summary of RFS2 Final Rule |publisher=[[Renewable Fuels Association]] |date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2010-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nYTK6ewp?url=http://www.ethanolrfa.org/objects/documents/2769/rfs2_rule_summary_brief.pdf |archivedate= February 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] lawmakers commented that they continued to oppose EPA's consideration of the "dicey science" of indirect land use that "punishes domestic fuels".&lt;ref name=NYTEPA010/&gt; House Agriculture Chairman [[Collin Peterson]] said, "... to think that we can credibly measure the impact of international indirect land use is completely unrealistic, and I will continue to push for legislation that prevents unreliable methods and unfair standards from burdening the biofuels industry."&lt;ref name=NYTEPA010/&gt;

EPA Administrator [[Lisa P. Jackson]] commented that the agency "did not back down from considering land use in its final rules, but the agency took new information into account that led to a more favorable calculation for ethanol".&lt;ref name=NYTEPA010/&gt; She cited new science and better data on crop yield and productivity, more information on co-products that could be produced from advanced biofuels and expanded land-use data for 160 countries, instead of the 40 considered in the proposed rule.&lt;ref name=NYTEPA010/&gt;

===Europe===
As of 2010, European Union and United Kingdom regulators had recognized the need to take ILUC into account, but had not determined the most appropriate methodology.

====UK Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation====
{{see also|Renewable transport fuel obligation}}

The [[UK]] [[Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation]] (RTFO) program requires fuel suppliers to report direct impacts, and asked the [[Renewable Fuels Agency]] (RFA) to report potential indirect impacts, including ILUC and commodity price changes.&lt;ref name="UKRTFO"/&gt; The RFA's July 2008 "Gallager Review", mentioned several risks regarding biofuels and required feedstock production to avoid agricultural land that would otherwise be used for food production, despite concluding that "quantification of GHG emissions from indirect land-use change requires subjective assumptions and contains considerable uncertainty".&lt;ref name=Gallagher0708/&gt; Some environmental groups argued that emissions from ILUC were not being taken into account and could be creating more emissions.&lt;ref name=Guardian0409&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/15/biofuels-carbon-emissions |title=UK biofuels target creating more emissions, environmentalists claim|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|author=Alok Jha|date=2009-04-15|accessdate=2009-06-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph0409&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/greenertransport/5153781/Green-fuels-produce-twice-as-much-carbon-as-fossil-fuels.html |title=Green fuels produce twice as much carbon as fossil fuels |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2009-04-15|accessdate=2009-06-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCNews0408&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7347142.stm |title=Petrol must now include biofuels|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2008-04-15|accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Union====
{{see also|Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport}}

On December 17, 2008, the [[European Parliament]] approved the Renewable Energy Sources Directive (COM(2008)19) and amendments to the Fuel Quality Directive (Directive 2009/30),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0030:EN:NOT|title=Directive 2009/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009|publisher=EUR Lex|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included sustainability criteria for biofuels and mandated consideration of ILUC. The Directive established a 10% biofuel target. A separate Fuel Quality Directive set the [[Low-carbon fuel standard#EU low-carbon fuel standard|EU's Low Carbon Fuel Standard]], requiring a 6% reduction in GHG intensity of EU transport fuels by 2020. The legislation ordered the [[European Commission]] to develop a methodology to factor in GHG emissions from ILUC by December 31, 2010, based on the best available scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="EU08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+20081217+ITEMS+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN#BKMD-27| title=Texts adopted Wednesday, 17 December 2008: Monitoring and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fuels |author=[[European Parliament]]|date=2008-12-17 |accessdate=2009-06-09}} ''For ILUC see "Whereas" items 11 through 18''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARBproposal"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ILUC_EU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biofuelsandclimate.wordpress.com/2008/12/31/europe-to-study-indirect-land-use/|title=Europe to Study Indirect Land Use |publisher=Biofuels and Climate Change |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the European Parliament defined lands that were ineligible for producing biofuel feedstocks for the purpose of the Directives. This category included [[wetland]]s and continuously [[forest]]ed areas with [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] cover of more than 30 percent or cover between 10 and 30 percent given evidence that its existing carbon stock was low enough to justify conversion.&lt;ref name="EU08"/&gt;

The Commission subsequently published terms of reference for three ILUC modeling exercises: one using a General Equilibrium model;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/pdf/DG%20TRADE%20GEM.pdf|title=Annex A - Terms of Reference - The indirect land use change impact of biofuels|publisher=European Commission|date=2009-06-29|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; one using a Partial Equilibrium model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/pdf/DG%20AGRI%20PEM.pdf|title=Annex 1 - Terms of Reference|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one comparing other global modeling exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/pdf/DG%20JRC%20model%20comparison.pdf|title=Terms of Reference - Administrative arrangement between JRC and DG ENV on Indirect Land Use Change emissions from biofuels|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also consulted on a limited range of high-level options for addressing ILUC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/pdf/iluc_preparatory_consultation_doc.pdf|title= Indirect land use change – Possible elements of a policy approach – preparatory draft for stakeholder/expert comments |publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which 17 countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/pdf/iluc_consultation_comments_by_country.zip|title=ILUC Consultation comments by country|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2010-01-29}} ''Download zip file with comments from 17 countries in PDF format.''&lt;/ref&gt; and 59 organizations responded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/pdf/iluc_consultation_comments_by_organisation.zip|title=ILUC Consultation comments by organisation|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2010-01-29}}''Download zip file with comments from 59 organisations in PDF format.''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on the Right to Food and several environmental organizations complained that the 2008 safeguards were inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/12/biofuels-and-land-grabs-in-poor-nations/ |title=Biofuels and 'Land Grabs' in Poor Nations |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |author=James Kanter |date=2009-06-12 |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.panda.org/downloads/eu_renewable_energy_directive_2008___summary.pdf|format=PDF |title=EU Renewable Energy Directive 2008 - Summary of WWF position |publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature]] |author=WWF European Policy Office |accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wetlands.org/NewsandEvents/NewsPressreleases/tabid/60/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1647/Default.aspx|title=Final Biofuel Directive limits impact on wetlands |publisher=[[Wetlands International]] |date= |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birdlife.org/eu/EU_policy/Biofuels/eu_biofuels5.html |title=Inadequacy of the Renewable Energy Directive|publisher=[[BirdLife International]] |date= |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNICA called for regulators to establish an empirical and  "globally accepted methodology" to consider ILUC, with the participation of researchers and scientists from biofuel crop-producing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.unica.com.br/noticias/show.asp?nwsCode={4236514C-4E5D-4F5F-86C6-44BE4D081B4D} |title=UNICA calls for globally harmonized methodologies to assess Indirect Land Use Change in IEA conference in Rotterdam |publisher=[[UNICA, Brazil|UNICA]]|date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 some [[NGO]]s accused the European Commission of lacking transparency given its reluctance to release documents relating to the ILUC work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportenvironment.org/News/2010/3/Green-groups-sue-Commission-over-withheld-biofuels-docs/ |title=Green groups sue Commission over withheld biofuels docs|publisher=Transport &amp; Environment|date=2010-03-09|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 the Partial and General Equilibrium Modelling results were made available, with the disclaimer that the EC had not adopted the views contained in the materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/renewables/studies/land_use_change_en.htm|title=Renewable Energy: Studies - Land Use Change|publisher=European Energy Commission|date=2010-03-26 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These indicate that a 1.25% increase in EU biofuel consumption would require around {{convert|5000000|ha}} of land globally.&lt;ref name=EUiluc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=542|title= Biofuels and global trade study goes online|publisher=European Commission Chief Economist |date=March 2010|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenarios for varied from 5.6-8.6% of road transport fuels. The study found that ILUC effects offset part of the emission benefits, and that above the 5.6% threshold, ILUC emissions increase rapidly increase.&lt;ref name=EUilucPDF/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCCEU/&gt; For the expected scenario of 5.6% by 2020, the study estimated that biodiesel production increases would be mostly domestic, while bioethanol production would take place mainly in Brazil, regardless of EU duties.&lt;ref name=EUilucPDF/&gt; The analysis concluded that eliminating trade barriers would further reduce emissions, because the EU would import more from Brazil.&lt;ref name=EUiluc/&gt; Under this scenario, "''direct emission savings from biofuels are estimated at 18 Mt {{chem|CO|2}}, additional emissions from ILUC at 5.3 Mt {{chem|CO|2}} (mostly in Brazil), resulting in a global net balance of nearly 13 Mt {{chem|CO|2}} savings in a 20 years horizon.''&lt;ref name=EUilucPDF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2010/march/tradoc_145954.pdf|title=Global Trade and Environmental Impact Study of the EU Biofuels Mandate|author=[[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI)|publisher=Directorate General for Trade of the European Commission |date=2010-03-25|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that ILUC emissions were much greater for biodiesel from [[vegetable oil]] and estimated that in 2020 even at the 5.6% level were over half the greenhouse gas emissions from diesel.&lt;ref name=EUilucPDF/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCCEU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/03/ifpri-20100326.html|title= Analysis Finds That First-Generation Biofuel Use of Up to 5.6% in EU Road Transport Fuels Delivers Net GHG Emissions Benefits After Factoring in Indirect Land Use Change|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2010-03-26|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the announcement, the Commission stated that it would publish a report on ILUC by the end of 2010.&lt;ref name=EC0610_2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/247&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=en&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=Commission sets up system for certifying sustainable biofuels: MEMO/10/247|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=2010-06-10|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Certification system=====
On June 10, 2010, the EC announced its decision to set up certification schemes for biofuels, including imports as part of the Renewable Energy Directive. The Commission encouraged E.U. nations, industry and [[NGO]]s to set up voluntary certification schemes.&lt;ref name=EC0610&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/711&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=Commission sets up system for certifying sustainable biofuels|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=2010-06-10|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0610&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/06/ecsust-20100610.html#more|title=European Commission Sets Up System for Certifying Sustainable Biofuels|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2010-06-10|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; EC figures for 2007 showed that 26% of [[biodiesel]] and 31% of [[ethanol fuel|bioethanol]] used in the E.U. was imported, mainly from [[Brazil]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=BBC0610&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10283258.stm|title=EU biofuels 'need to be certified for sustainability'EU biofuels 'need to be certified for sustainability'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|author=Mark Kinver|date=2010-06-10|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Reactions=====
UNICA welcomed the EU efforts to "engage independent experts in its assessments" but requested  that improvements because "... the report currently contains a certain number of inaccuracies, so once these are corrected, we anticipate even higher benefits resulting from the use of Brazilian sugarcane ethanol."&lt;ref name=UNICAEU10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.unica.com.br/releases/show.asp?rlsCode={0BBE41C2-2FD4-4D09-B088-8A112C031E43}|title=Report highlights benefits of Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, confirms highest emissions savings|publisher=[[UNICA, Brazil|UNICA]]|date=2010-03-29|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNICA highlighted the fact that the report assumed land expansion that "does not take into consideration the agro-ecological zoning for sugarcane in Brazil, which prevents cane from expanding into any type of native vegetation."&lt;ref name=UNICAEU10/&gt;

Critics said the 10% figure was reduced to 5.6% of transport fuels partly by exaggerating the contribution of [[electric vehicle]]s (EV) in 2020, as the study assumed EVs would represent 20% of new car sales, two and six times the car industry's own estimate.&lt;ref name=ReutersEU10/&gt; They also claimed the study "exaggerates to around 45 percent the contribution of bioethanol—the greenest of all biofuels—and consequently downplays the worst impacts of biodiesel."&lt;ref name=ReutersEU10&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LDE62O1UK.htm|title=EU report signals U-turn on biofuels target|author=[[Reuters]]|publisher=AlertNet|date=2010-0325-|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental groups found that the measures "are too weak to halt a dramatic increase in deforestation".&lt;ref name=BBC0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenpeace0610/&gt; According to [[Greenpeace]], "indirect land-use change impacts of biofuel production still are not properly addressed", which for them was the most dangerous problem of biofuels&lt;ref name=Greenpeace0610&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/eu-unit/press-centre/press-releases2/broken-biofuel-policies-still|title=Broken biofuel policies still driving rainforest destruction|publisher=[[Greenpeace]] European unit|date=2010-06-10|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] has 154 [[protected area]]s known as [[United States National Forest|National Forests]] covering 188,336,179 acres (762,169&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/294,275 sq. mi).&lt;ref name=Areas/&gt; The National Forests are managed by the [[U.S. Forest Service]], an agency of the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us&amp;nbsp;– Meet the Forest Service |publisher=U.S. Forest Service |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/aboutus/meetfs.shtml |accessdate=October 22, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EaRKIXs3?url=http://www.fs.fed.us/aboutus/meetfs.shtml |archivedate=February 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first National Forest was established as the [[Yellowstone National Forest|Yellowstone Park Timber and Land Reserve]] on March 30, 1891, then in the [[Department of the Interior]]. In 1897, the [[Organic Act of 1897|Organic Act]] provided purposes for which forest reserves could be established, including to protect the forest, secure water supplies, and supply timber. With the [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891]], the [[President of the United States]] was given the power to set aside forest reserves in the public domain. With the [[Transfer Act of 1905]], forest reserves became part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the newly created U.S. Forest Service.&lt;ref name=FSBLMhistory&gt;{{Cite document |first1=Ross W. |last1=Gorte |first2=Betsy A. |last2=Cody |title=The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management: History and Analysis of Merger Proposals |publisher=Congressional Research Service Reports for Congress |url=http://cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/Forests/for-15.cfm |date=November 7, 1995 |accessdate=October 22, 2012 |postscript=. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EaRFZJS1?url=http://cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/Forests/for-15.cfm |archivedate=February 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dates/&gt;

By 1907 President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] more than doubled the forest reserve acreage, and [[United States Congress|Congress]] responded by limiting the President's ability to proclaim new reserves. The National Forest System underwent a major reorganization in 1908, and in 1911 Congress authorized new additions to the system under the authority of the [[Weeks Act]]. The management goals provided by the Organic Act were expanded upon by the [[Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960]] to include "outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes" as well as for the establishment of [[National Wilderness Preservation System#Wilderness areas|wilderness areas]].&lt;ref name=FSBLMhistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dates/&gt;

As of September 30, 2014, the Forest Service manages a total {{convert|192922127|acre|km2}}, {{convert|188336179|acre|km2}} of which are National Forests. The additional land areas include 20 [[United States National Grassland|National Grasslands]], 59 purchase units, 19 research and experimental areas, five land utilization projects and 37 other areas. The National Forest System has an extensive and complicated history of reorganization, so while there are currently 154 named National Forests, many of these are managed together as either a single forest or separate forests.{{ref label|Note1|A|A}}&lt;ref name=Areas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dates/&gt;&lt;ref name=states&gt;{{cite web |title=Find a Forest by State |publisher=U.S. Forest Service |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/map/state_list.shtml |accessdate=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is at least one National Forest in all but ten states:
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Dakota, New Jersey, and Rhode Island (although Kansas and North Dakota have [[national grasslands]]). In addition, [[Puerto Rico]] contains [[El Yunque National Forest]]. Alaska has the most national forest land with 21.9 million acres (8.9 million ha), followed by California (20.8 million acres, 8.4 million ha) and Idaho (20.4 million acres, 8.3 million ha). Idaho also has the greatest percent of its land in national forests with 38.2%, followed by Oregon with 24.7% and Colorado with 20.9%. On maps, national forests in the west generally show the true extent of their area, but those in the east often only show purchase districts, within which usually only a minority of the land is owned by the Forest Service.&lt;ref name=Areas/&gt;

== Notes ==
* {{note label|Note1|A|A}}The listed National Forest names represent the current management divisions of the National Forest System. Forests that are managed separately, such as Allegheny National Forest and Monongahela National Forest, are listed as separate forests. But forests that are managed together may or may not be listed separately. Forests managed together and with hyphenated names, such as Salmon-Challis National Forest, are considered to be a single National Forest. Forests that are managed together under titles such as Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests, are considered to be separate forests. National Forests listed in this column in small text are constituent National Forests managed by, but not included in the name of, the named National Forest in normal text. If you are counting to reach 154 National Forests, count hyphenated names as two forests, with the exception of Manti-La Sal, which is the official name of one forest. Uinta-Wasatch-Cache is counted as three and George Washington and Jefferson is counted as two.&lt;ref name=Areas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dates/&gt;&lt;ref name=states/&gt;
* {{note label|Note1|B|B}}In the case of National Forests in multiple states, the states are listed in descending order by land area of that forest contained in each state. States with the most area of that forest are listed first, while states with the least are listed last. Coordinates are those by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, and may not be representative of the entire forest.&lt;ref name=GNIS/&gt;
* {{note label|Note1|C|C}}The history of the National Forest System is very complicated. Forests have been transferred between agencies, renamed, divided, consolidated, discontinued, established from parts of existing forests, had portions ceded to other forests, expanded from other lands, among various other actions. The date given represents the day: that forest was established as is, a predecessor forest with the same boundaries was established under a different name, or the earliest date of establishment of a forest that was combined in whole with another forest.&lt;ref name=Dates/&gt;
*{{note label|Note1|D|D}}Forests with citations to the three books in the ''This Land '' series by Robert H. Mohlenbrock can be found in the section of the cited book that corresponds to that forest.

*{{note label|Note1|E|E}}The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) consists of {{convert|154830|acre|ha}} of U.S. Forest Service land in the Lake Tahoe watershed. The LTBMU was formed from existing Forest Service land that was managed by [[Eldorado National Forest|Eldorado]], [[Tahoe National Forest|Tahoe]], and [[Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest|Humboldt-Toiyabe]] national forests. Only {{convert|767|acre|ha}} of land in LTBMU is officially designated as LTBMU, and the remainder of the land is still officially designated as the three sources national forests. However, all of this land is managed separately as LTBMU, essentially making it a separate national forest.&lt;ref name=Areas/&gt;&lt;ref name=LTBMU/&gt;&lt;ref name=LTBMUFP/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24202">The '''list of extinct cetaceans''' features the [[Extinction|extinct]] [[genera]] and [[species]] of the order [[Cetacea]]. The cetaceans ([[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s) are descendants of land-living mammals, the [[even-toed ungulate]]s. The earliest cetaceans were still hoofed mammals. These early cetaceans became gradually better adapted for swimming than for walking on land, finally [[Evolution of cetaceans|evolving]] into fully marine cetaceans.

This list currently includes only [[fossil]] genera and species. However, the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] population of [[gray whale]]s (''Eschrichtius robustus'') became extinct in the 18th century, and the [[baiji]] (or Chinese river dolphin, ''Lipotes vexillifer'') was declared "[[functionally extinct]]" after an expedition in late 2006 failed to find any in the [[Yangtze River]].

[[File:BIG STUMP MEADOW - NARA - 542732.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Big Stump Grove in 1972]]
The following is a '''list of giant sequoia groves'''. All naturally occurring [[Grove (nature)|groves]] of [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoias]] are located in moist, unglaciated ridges and valleys of the west slope of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range in [[California]], [[United States]]. They occur between 1370{{spaced ndash}}2000 meters (4500–6500&amp;nbsp;ft) elevation in the northern half of the range, and 1700–2250 m (5500–7500&amp;nbsp;ft) in the south.

Groves in the northern half of the range (north of the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]]) are widely scattered and mostly small, while those south of the Kings River are more numerous. The total area of all the groves combined is approximately 14,416 ha (35,607 acres). The groves are listed from north to south in the list below.

This list is based on five different sources, with slightly varying views on what constitutes a discrete grove; the differing interpretations are noted ''in italics''. The lists of groves were compiled by Rundel (1972; recognizing 75 groves), Flint (1987; recognizing 65 groves), Willard (1994; recognizing 65 groves), the ''[[Giant Sequoia National Monument]] Visitor's Guide'' (2003) and the Draft Giant Sequoia National Monument Plan 2010. Currently, the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Park Service]] cites Rundel's total of 75 groves in its visitor publications. The updated lists from Willard and Flint are now known to be more accurate, therefore some of Rundel's 75 groves have been removed from this list. Below compiles a list of 68 sequoia groves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr151/psw_gtr151_28_willard.pdf|publisher=USFS|title=The Natural Giant Sequoia (''Sequoiadendron Giganteum'') Groves of the Sierra Nevada, California—An Updated Annotated List|first=Dwight|last=Willard|accessdate=2014-05-14|series=USDA Forest Service Gen.

|Once the second-largest grove, but much logged around 1890-1900.  However, nearly 100 widely scattered old-growth Giant Sequoias remain (apparently bypassed by the loggers), also good regrowth of younger trees.  Home of the Boole Tree which the loggers spared, as it was by far the largest tree in the grove, and now identified as the sixth-largest tree by volume.  Also home of the Chicago Stump, the remnant of the General Noble Tree which was cut for the 1893 [[World Columbian Exposition]].  The General Noble Tree was the second largest tree in the grove (after the Boole Tree) and it was the largest tree ever cut down. Although not among the very largest Giant Sequoias, the General Noble Tree was perhaps among the top 30 largest Giant Sequoias before it was cut.

This is a list of the highest [[mountain]]s of [[Switzerland]]. This list only includes summits above {{convert|3600|m|ft|0}}&lt;!--1000m below Monte Rosa--&gt; with a [[topographic prominence]] of at least 30 metres. For a list of mountains (major summits only) including lower summits, see [[List of mountains of Switzerland]]. 

The [[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]] defines a summit in the [[Alps]] as independent, if the connecting ridge between it and a higher summit drops at least 30 m (a prominence/drop of 30 m, with the lowest point referred to as the "key col"). There are over 250 such summits exceeding 3,600 m in Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;Christian Thöni, [http://www.gipfelverzeichnis.ch Directory of the mountains of Switzerland]&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[High Alps]], in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Valais]], [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Graubünden]], [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]]. All mountain heights and prominences on the list are from the largest-[[scale (map)|scale]] maps available.&lt;ref name=maps&gt;All mountain heights and prominences are from the 1:25,000 [[Swisstopo]] topographic maps.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases local people or surveyors made earlier ascents. In particular, chamois and ibex hunters are expected to have reached many summits. Years in italics indicate that it is known that an earlier ascent was made, for example by the presence of artifacts on top or the summit's prior use as a triangulation point.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;ascent

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8215">The idea that there are specific '''marine counterparts to land creatures''',&lt;ref&gt;Succinctly expressed by [[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], "It used to be a common belief that everything on the earth had its counterpart in the sea" ([[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], Kenneth Frazier, ''Bestiary: Being a Translation of a Latin Bestiary of the Twelfth Century'' (London, 1954), reissued as ''The Book of Beasts'' 1960:250ff).&lt;/ref&gt; inherited from the writers on [[natural history]] in [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]], was firmly believed in [[Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;See Hasan M. El-Shamy, ''Folk traditions of the Arab world: a guide to motif classification'', 1995, under F133.1, Marine counterpart to land.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Medieval Europe]], and is exemplified by the creatures represented in the medieval animal encyclopedias called [[Bestiary|bestiaries]] and in the parallels drawn in the moralising attributes attached to each. "The creation was a mathematical diagram drawn in parallel lines," T. H. White said a propos the bestiary he translated. "Things did not only have a moral they often had physical counterparts in other strata. There was a horse in the land and a sea-horse in the sea. For that matter there was probably a [[Pegasus]] in heaven".&lt;ref&gt;T.H. White, ''op. cit'' p 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of perfect analogies in the fauna of land and sea was considered part of the perfect [[symmetry]]&lt;ref&gt;The "perfection" of symmetry was an idea highly developed in the [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean tradition]].&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Creator_deity|Creator]]'s plan, offered as the "[[book of nature]]" to mankind, for which a text could be found in ''[[Book of Job|Job]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you. Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this? In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Job 12:7–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea appears in the Jewish Tannaic sources as well, as brought down in Babylonian Talmud, Chulin 127a. Rashi (Psalms 49:2) traces this to a biblical source – the land is referred to as "Chaled", from the weasel (chulda), because the weasel is the only animal on dry land that does not have its counterpart in the sea.
 
All of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] was considered to reflect the Creator, and Man could learn about the Creator through studying the Creation, an assumption that underlies the "[[watchmaker analogy]]" offered as a proof of God's existence.

The correspondence between the realms of earth and sea, extending to its denizens, offers examples of the taste for [[allegory]] engendered by Christian and Islamic methods of [[exegesis]], which also encouraged the [[doctrine of signatures]], a "key" to the meaning and use of herbs.

The source text that was most influential in compiling the bestiaries of the 12th and 13th centuries was the ''[[Physiologus]]'', one of the most widely read and copied secular texts of the Middle Ages. Written in Greek in Alexandria the 2nd century CE and accumulating further "exemplary" beasts in the next three centuries and more, ''Physiologus'' was transmitted in the West in Latin, and eventually translated into many vernacular languages: many manuscripts in various languages survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestiary.ca/intro.htm David Badke, "The Medieval Bestiary: Introduction"]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On the Characteristics of Animals'' (A. F. Scholfield, in [[Loeb Classical Library]], 1958).

Christian writers, trained in [[Anagoge|anagogical thinking]] and expecting to find spiritual instruction inherent in the processes of Nature, disregarded the caveat in [[Pliny's Natural History]],&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Naturalis''IX.2.&lt;/ref&gt; where the idea is presented as a "vulgar opinion": 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hence it is that the vulgar notion may very possibly be true, that whatever is produced in any other department of Nature, is to be found in the sea as well; while, at the same time, many other productions are there to be found which nowhere else exist. That there are to be found in the sea the forms, not only of terrestrial animals, but of inanimate objects even, is easily to be understood by all who will take the trouble to examine the grape-fish, the sword-fish, the sawfish, and the cucumber-fish, which last so strongly resembles the real cucumber both in colour and in smell.&lt;ref&gt;Translation of [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] points out that many more things are found in the sea than on the land, and also mentions the correspondences that may be discovered between many non-living objects of the land and living creatures in the sea. 

Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] reasons based on [[analogy]], that since there is a serpent in the grass, there must be an eel in the sea; because there is a [[Leviathan]] in the sea, there must be a [[Behemoth]] on the land. (''City of God''? xi.15?)

&lt;!--this doctrine doesn't appear in the on-line translation of excerpts:[[Isidore of Seville]]'s encyclopedic ''Etymologiae'',&lt;ref&gt;''Etymologiae'' XII?&lt;/ref&gt; contained a section about animals, derived from Classical authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]].--&gt; 
The reaction to such anagogical thinking set in with the unfolding of critical [[Scientific thinking|scientific thought]] in the 17th century. Sir [[Thomas Browne]] devoted a chapter of his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' to dispelling such a belief: Chapter XXIV: "That all Animals in the land are in their kinde&lt;!--kinde in original--&gt; in the Sea."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo324.html On-line text].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] the ancient conception was given an innovative and rationalized cast by [[Benoît de Maillet]] in describing the transformations and metamorphoses undergone by creatures of the sea to render them fit for life on land, a proto-evolutionist concept, though it was based on superficial morphological similarities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are in the Sea, Fish of almost all the Figures of Land-Animals, and even of Birds. She includes Plants, Flowers, and some Fruits; the Nettle, the Rose, the [[Dianthus|Pink]], the Melon and the Grape, are to be found there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the Quadrupeds, we not only find in the Sea, Species of the same Figure and Inclinations, and in the Waves living on the same Aliments by which they are nourished on Land, we have also Examples of those Species living equally in the Air and in the Water. Have not the Sea-Apes precisely the same figure with those of the Land?&lt;ref&gt;Maillet, ''Telliamed'': "Sixth Day: Origin of Man and Animals"; this and several further passages are quoted in Mary Efrosini Gregory, ''Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought'' :22f., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though in ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' Ishmael, with a nod to Sir Thomas Browne's wording, denies the claim that land animals find their counterparts in the sea,&lt;blockquote&gt;For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Moby-Dick'', ch. 58 "Brit".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
in discussing [[dolphin]]s trained to aid scuba divers, a 1967 ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' article could still casually state: "It's hoped that the marine counterparts of some land animals can be trained to become useful members of the [[SEALAB (United States Navy)|Man-in-the-Sea program]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Stimson, "Lifeguards: Friendly dolphins— the mammals with the high IQ— are being trained for undersea rescue missions", ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15913">In [[astrophysics]], the '''mass–luminosity relation''' is an equation giving the relationship between a star's mass and its [[luminosity]], first noted by [[Jakob Karl Ernst Halm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuiper|first=G.P.|date=1938|title=The Empirical Mass-Luminosity Relationship|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=88|pages=472–506|bibcode = 1938ApJ....88..472K |doi = 10.1086/143999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship is represented by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} = \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^a&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; are the luminosity and mass of the Sun and 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;ref name="evolutionofstars"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salaris|first=Maurizio|author2=Santi Cassisi|title=Evolution of stars and stellar populations |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date=2005|pages=138–140|isbn=0-470-09220-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r1dNzr8viRYC&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=Mass-Luminosity%20relation&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.5 is commonly used for [[main sequence|main-sequence]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Astro/herrus.html#c3|title=Mass-luminosity relationship|publisher=Hyperphysics|accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This equation and the usual value of ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.5 only applies to main-sequence stars with masses 2''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;55''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; and does not apply to red giants or white dwarfs.  As a star approaches the [[Eddington Luminosity]] then ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

In summary, the relations for stars with different ranges of mass are, to a good approximation, as the following:&lt;ref name="evolutionofstars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="advanced"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Neb Duric|Duric]]|first=[[Neb Duric|Nebojsa]]|title=Advanced astrophysics|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=2004|pages=19|isbn=978-0-521-52571-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ljdYMmI0EIC&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;ots=VdMUIiCdP_&amp;dq=Mass-luminosity%20relation&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jila.colorado.edu/~pja/astr3730/lecture18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \approx 0.23\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{2.3}   \qquad (M &lt; 0.43M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} = \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^4   \qquad\qquad      (0.43M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 2M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \approx 1.4\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{3.5}   \qquad (2M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 20M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \approx 32000 \frac{M}{M_{\odot}}   \qquad \qquad (M &gt; 55M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;

For stars with masses less than 0.43''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, [[convection]] is the sole energy transport process, so the relation changes significantly. For stars with masses ''M''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;55''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; the relationship flattens out and becomes ''L''&amp;nbsp;∝&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;ref name="evolutionofstars"/&gt; but in fact those stars don't last because they are unstable and quickly lose matter by intense solar winds. It can be shown this change is due to an increase in [[radiation pressure]] in massive stars.&lt;ref name="evolutionofstars"/&gt; These equations are determined empirically by determining the mass of stars in binary systems to which the distance is known via standard parallax measurements or other techniques. After enough stars are plotted, stars will form a line on a logarithmic plot and slope of the line gives the proper value of ''a''.

Another form, valid for K-type main-sequence stars, that avoids the discontinuity in the exponent has been given by Cuntz &amp; Wang;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cuntz|first=M.|author2=Wang, Zh. | date=2018|title=The Mass–Luminosity Relation for a Refined Set of Late-K/M Dwarfs|journal=Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society|volume=2 |issue=1|bibcode = 2018RNAAS...2a..19C|doi = 10.3847/2515-5172/aaaa67}}&lt;/ref&gt; it reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}}  \approx \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{a(M)}   \qquad\qquad      (0.20M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 0.85M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;
with 
:&lt;math&gt;a(M) = -141.7 \cdot M^4 + 232.4 \cdot M^3 - 129.1 \cdot M^2 + 33.29 \cdot M + 0.215&lt;/math&gt;
(''M'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;).  This relation is based on data by Mann and collaborators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mann|first=A. W.| author2=Gaidos, E.|author3=Ansdell, M.|date=2013|title=Spectro-thermometry of M Dwarfs and Their Candidate Planets: Too Hot, Too Cool, or Just Right?|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=779 |issue=2|id=188 (15 pages)|bibcode = 2013ApJ...779..188M|doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/779/2/188|arxiv=1311.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used moderate-resolution spectra of nearby late-K and M dwarfs with known parallaxes and interferometrically determined radii to refine their effective temperatures and luminosities. Those stars have also been used as a calibration sample for [[Kepler mission|Kepler]] candidate objects. Besides avoiding the discontinuity in the exponent at ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.43''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, the relation also recovers ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.0 for ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8771;&amp;nbsp;0.85''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;.

The mass/luminosity relation is important because it can be used to find the distance to [[Binary system (astronomy)|binary system]]s which are too far for normal [[parallax]] measurements, using a technique called "[[dynamical parallax]]".&lt;ref name="double"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullaney|first=James|title=Double and multiple stars and how to observe them|publisher=Springer|date=2005|isbn=1-85233-751-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OM3hozlKt9AC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=da06NVpIY_&amp;dq=Mass-Luminosity%20relation%20distance%20binary&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique, the masses of the two stars in a binary system are estimated, usually as being the mass of the Sun. Then, using [[Kepler's laws]] of [[celestial mechanics]], the distance between the stars is calculated. Once this distance is found, the distance away can be found via the arc subtended in the sky, giving a preliminary distance measurement. From this measurement and the [[apparent magnitude]]s of both stars, the luminosities can be found, and by using the mass–luminosity relationship, the masses of each star. These masses are used to re-calculate the separation distance, and the process is repeated. The process is iterated many times, and accuracies as high as 5% can be achieved.&lt;ref name="double"/&gt; The mass/luminosity relationship can also be used to determine the lifetime of stars by noting that lifetime is approximately proportional to M/L although one finds that more massive stars have shorter lifetimes than what the M/L relationship predicts. A more sophisticated calculation factors in a star's loss of mass over time.

==Derivation==
Deriving a theoretically exact mass/luminosity relation requires finding the energy generation equation and building a thermodynamic model of the inside of a star. However, the basic relation ''L''&amp;nbsp;∝&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; can be derived using some basic physics and simplifying assumptions.&lt;ref name="physicsofstars"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=A.C.|title=The Physics of Stars|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=1999|isbn=978-0-471-98798-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such derivation was performed by astrophysicist [[Arthur Eddington]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lecchini|first=Stefano|title=How Dwarfs Became Giants. The Discovery of the Mass-Luminosity Relation|isbn=978-3-9522882-6-9|publisher=Bern Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science|url=http://philoscience.unibe.ch/bern-studies/how-dwarfs-became-giants-the-discovery-of-the-mass-luminosity-relation}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The derivation showed that stars can be approximately modelled as ideal gases, which was a new, somewhat radical idea at the time. What follows is a somewhat more modern approach based on the same principles.

An important factor controlling the luminosity of a star (energy emitted per unit time) is the rate of energy dissipation through its bulk. Where there is no [[heat convection]], this dissipation happens mainly by photons diffusing. By integrating [[Fick%27s_laws_of_diffusion#Fick's_first_law|Fick's first law]] over the surface of some radius ''r'' in the [[radiation zone]] (where there is neglible convection), we get the total outgoing energy flux which is equal to the luminosity by [[conservation of energy]]:
::&lt;math&gt;L = -4\pi\,r^2 D\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''D'' is the photons [[diffusion coefficient]], and ''u'' is the energy density.

Note that this assumes that the star is not fully convective, and that all heat creating processes ([[nucleosynthesis]]) happen in the core, below the radiation zone. These two assumptions are not correct in [[red giant]]s, which do not obey the usual mass-luminosity relation. Stars of low mass are also fully convective, hence do not obey the law.

Approximating the star by a [[black body]], the energy density is related to the temperature by [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] by:
::&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{4}{c} \, \sigma_B \, T^4 &lt;/math&gt;
where
::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_B = \frac{2 \pi^5 k_B^4 }{15 c^2 h^3} = \frac{\pi^2 k_B^4}{60 \hbar^3 c^2}. &lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]].

As in the [[Diffusion#Elementary_theory_of_diffusion_coefficient_in_gases|elementary theory of diffusion coefficient in gases]], the diffusion coefficient ''D'' approximately satisfies:
::&lt;math&gt; D = \frac{1}{3}c\,\lambda &lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;lambda; is the photon [[mean free path]].

Since matter is fully ionized in the star core (as well as where the temperature is of the same order of magnitude as inside the core), photons collide mainly with electrons, and so &amp;lambda; [[Mean_free_path#Derivation|satisfies]] 
::&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{1}{n_e\sigma_{e\cdot\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron density and:
::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{e\cdot\gamma} = \frac{8\pi}{3}\left(\frac{\alpha\hbar c}{m_ec^2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
is the cross section for electron-photon scattering, equal to [[Thomson scattering|Thomson cross-section]]. &amp;alpha; is the [[fine-structure constant]] and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; the electron mass.

The average stellar electron density is related to the star mass ''M'' and radius ''R''
::&lt;math&gt;\langle n_e \rangle = \frac{M}{m_e 4\pi R^3/3}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, by the [[virial theorem]], the total kinetic energy is equal to half the gravitational potential energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, so if the average nuclei mass is ''m''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, then the average kinetic energy per nucleus satisfies:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}k_B T = \frac{1}{2}E_G\frac{m_n}{M} = C\frac{3}{10}\frac{G M m_n}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
where the temperature ''T'' is averaged over the star and ''C'' is a factor of order one related to the stellar structure and can be estimated from the star approximate [[polytrope|polytropic index]].
Note that this does not hold for large enough stars, where the radiation pressure is larger than the gas pressure in the radiation zone, hence the relation between temperature, mass and raidus is different, as elaborated below.

Wrapping up everything, we also take ''r'' to be equal to ''R'' up tp a factor, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; at ''r'' is replaced by its stellar average up to a facotr. The combined factor is approximately 1/15 for the sun, and we get:
:&lt;math&gt;L = -4\pi\,r^2 D\frac{\partial u}{\partial r} \approx 4\pi\,R^2 D\frac{u}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;L \approx  \frac{1}{15}\frac{64\pi^2}{9}\frac {\sigma_B}{\sigma_{e\cdot\gamma}}\frac{R^4 T^4}{M}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \approx  \frac{1}{15}\frac{2\pi^3}{9\cdot5^5}\frac {G^4\,m_e^2\,m_n^5}{\alpha^2\hbar^5}\,M^3 = 4\cdot {10^{26}}_W \,\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^3&lt;/math&gt;

The added factor is actually dependent on ''M'', therefore the law has an approximate &lt;math&gt;M^{3.5}&lt;/math&gt; dependence.

==Distinguishing between small and large stellar masses==
{{Main|Eddington luminosity}}
One may distinguish between the cases of small and large stellar masses by deriving the above results using radiation pressure. In this case, it is easier to use the optical opacity &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and to consider the internal temperature T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; directly; more precisely, one can consider the average temperature in the [[radiation zone]].

The consideration begins by noting the relation between the [[radiation pressure]] P&lt;sub&gt;rad&lt;/sub&gt; and luminosity. The gradient of radiation pressure is equal to the momentum transfer absorbed from the radiation, giving:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP_{rad}}{dr} = -\frac {\kappa\rho}{c}\frac{L}{4\pi r^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where c is the velocity of light. Here, &lt;math&gt;1/\kappa\rho = l&lt;/math&gt;; the photon mean free path.

The radiation pressure is related to the temperature by &lt;math&gt;P_{rad} = \frac{4\sigma}{3c}{T_I}^4&lt;/math&gt;, therefore

&lt;math&gt;{T_I}^3\frac{dT_I}{dr} = -\frac {3\kappa\rho}{16\sigma}\frac{L}{4\pi r^2},&lt;/math&gt;

from which it follows directly that

&lt;math&gt;L \varpropto {T_I}^4 \frac {R}{\rho}  \varpropto {T_I}^4  \frac {R^4}{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the radiation zone gravity is balanced by the pressure on the gas coming from both itself (approximated by ideal gas pressure) and from the radiation. For a small enough stellar mass the latter is negligible and one arrives at

&lt;math&gt;T_I \varpropto \frac {M}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

as before. More precisely, since integration was done from 0 to R so &lt;math&gt;T_I-T_E&lt;/math&gt; on the left side, but the surface temperature T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; can be neglected with respect to the internal temperature T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;.

From this it follows directly that

&lt;math&gt;L \varpropto M^3.&lt;/math&gt;

For a large enough stellar mass, the radiation pressure is larger than the gas pressure in the radiation zone. Plugging in the radiation pressure, instead of the ideal gas pressure used above, yields

&lt;math&gt;{T_I}^4\varpropto \frac{M^2}{R^4},&lt;/math&gt;

hence

&lt;math&gt;L \varpropto M.&lt;/math&gt;

==Core and surface temperatures==

To the first approximation, stars are [[black body]] radiators with a surface area of 4''πR''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, from the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], the luminosity is related to the surface temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, and thrught it to the [[Color temperature|color]] of the star, by
:&lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi R^2\sigma_B T_S^4&lt;/math&gt;
where ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]], 5.67&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;8&lt;/sup&gt;W m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

The luminosity is equal to the total energy produced by the star per unit time. Since this energy is produced by nucleosynthesis, usually in the star core (this is not true for [[red giant]]s), the core temperature is related to the luminosity by the [[Stellar nucleosynthesis#Reaction rate|nucleosynthesis rate]] per unit volume:
::&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{dE}{dt} \approx  \epsilon \, \frac{4\pi}{3} R^3 \, n_A \, n_B  \, \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3 m_R}}\, \sqrt{E_0(T)} \frac{S(E_0(T))}{kT} e^{-\frac{3E_0(T)}{kT}}  &lt;/math&gt;
Here, &amp;epsilon; is the total energy emitted in the [[proton-proton chain reaction|chain reaction]] or [[CNO cycle|reaction cycle]]. &lt;math&gt;E_0 = \left(\sqrt{E_G}\,kT/2\right)^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gamow peak]] energy, dependent on ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Gamow factor]]. Additionally, ''S''(''E'')/E is the reaction cross section, ''n'' is number density, &lt;math&gt;m_R = m_A\cdot m_B/(m_A+m_B)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced mass]] for the particle collision, and ''A'',''B'' are the two species participating in the limiting reaction (e.g. both stand for a proton in the [[proton-proton chain reaction]], or ''A'' a proton and ''B'' an {{nuclide|nitrogen|14|link=yes}} nucleus for the [[CNO cycle]]).

Since the radius ''R'' is itself a function of the temperature and the mass, one may solve this equation to get the core temperature.

The '''MegaFlyover''' project was a seven-month aerial survey from June 2004 to January 2005 by explorer/ecologist [[J. Michael Fay]] and pilot [[Peter Ragg]] sponsored by the [[National Geographic Society]] and others.  They criss-crossed Africa from [[South Africa]] to [[Morocco]] in a modified [[Cessna 182]], logging 60,000 miles (about 100,000 kilometers) and taking more than 100,000 high-resolution digital GPS-marked images shot from low altitude (every 20 seconds).

It was partly inspired by Mike's earlier [[MegaTransect]] expedition in 1999.

Five hundred of these images have been added to [[Google Earth]]'s database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/illuminated-continent.html The illuminated continent] - Google Blog, 9/16/2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Tlaloc''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''Monte Tláloc''', sometimes wrongly listed as ''Cerro el Mirador''; [[Nahuatl]]: ''Tlālōcatepētl'') is a [[mountain]] and [[archaeological site]] in central [[Mexico]]. It is located in the [[State of Mexico]], in the municipalities of [[Ixtapaluca]] and [[Texcoco, State of Mexico|Texcoco]], close to the state border with [[Puebla]]. Formerly an active [[volcano]], it has an official [[altitude]] of {{convert|4120|m|ft|0}} above sea level, thus being the 9th tallest mountain of Mexico.

The mountain was considered by the [[Nahua people|Nahuan peoples]], foremost among them the [[Aztec]]s, to be specially sacred to the raingod [[Tlaloc]]. In fact, the mountain was believed to be one of his primary earthly dwelling places, called [[Tlalocan]]. Attribution of this and other mountains to the sacred presence of rain deities predates the Aztec era by centuries, even millennia. At the summit there are still remains of a shrine where high ceremonies would have been carried out. The rites of Tlaloc were otherwise performed at his temples, most famously that occupying one half of the [[Templo Mayor]] at the heart of the temple precinct of nearby Mexico-[[Tenochtitlan]]. The inherent analogy of temple pyramids to sacred mountains allows for the very likely possibility that the central temple of the Aztec capital, as such, was at least partly a symbolic representation of the actual mount Tlaloc, and that the summit shrine of the temple was itself an analogue to that atop the mountain.

Together with mount Telapón ({{convert|4060|m|ft|0}}) and some other, lower peaks, mount Tlaloc forms the "Sierra de Río Frío", the northernmost tip of the [[Sierra Nevada (Mexico)|Sierra Nevada]]. The mountain is easily accessible from [[Mexican Federal Highway 150|Federal Highway 150]] at the town of [[Río Frío de Juárez]]. The long, but easy and non-technical hike provides an elevation gain of over 1200 m.&lt;ref name= Neyra&gt;{{cite book |last= Neyra Jáuregui|first= Jorge A.|date= 2012|title= Guía de las altas montañas de México y una de Guatemala|location= Mexico City|publisher= [[CONABIO]]|pages= 142–163|isbn=978-607-7607-60-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; More strenuous routes depart from San Pablo Ixayoc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite summitpost |id=151413 |name=Tlaloc (Tlalocatepetl) |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from other towns outside Texcoco.

== Mountain's precinct ==
Mount Tlaloc features an enclosed precinct on its summit which could be reached through by taking a pathway up the mountain and entering the western side of the enclosure. The structure of the precinct consisted largely of pumice and tufa, which were locally found and were easily molded due to their soft physicality.The precinct houses 5 rock formations, one at the center and 4 at the corners of the ''tetzacualo'', or courtyard. The center rock is thought to be analogous to the [[Codex Borgia]] which depicts [[Tlaloc]] standing in the center of his four rain forms (which are represented by the four directions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Townsend |first= R. F. |date= 1991 |title= To Change Place: Aztec Ceremonial Landscapes|publisher= University Press of Colorado |pages= 26–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These 5 rock formations are representative of the [[Tlaloque]], which are spirits that used vessels of water to distribute rain across the land. In addition, one side of the courtyard featured a construct that housed a statue of [[Tlaloc]] among other idols that represented nearby sacred regions. This precinct served a major role in allowing a setting at which supplication could be made to the [[Tlaloque]] for sustenance of crops and the people of Mesoamerica.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/971561.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A1bec8859e024ff2250f29daa013608a7]

== Ritual practices ==

The Aztecs were known for their rituals that were undertaken in order to secure rain for the land. Extravagant ceremonies, plentiful offerings, and the lives of young Mesoamericans were all offered to [[Tlaloc]] in order to please him several times each year with an emphasis at the beginning of the rain season. One annual feast called [[Huey Tozoztli]] occurred atop Mount Tlaloc and coincided with the date of highest annual temperature, which usually occurred in April, right before the start of the rainy season. The rulers and elites of [[Tenochtitlan]] and nearby states, such as [[Xochimilco]], [[Tlaxcala]], and [[Tlacopan]], were also cited to have joined the feast. Another ceremony that took place atop Mount Tlaloc was Atlachualo which was celebrated from mid-February to early March. This ceremony involved the sacrifice of children who were dressed "like gods" and taken to the mountain top and had their hearts removed for ceremonial purposes. The children were encouraged to cry because their tears symbolized abundant rains and if they did not cry on their own on the way to the precinct, their fingernails were cited to have been removed to incite tears. The main objective of these offerings were to please Tlaloc and the [[Tlaloque]] in order to ensure rainfall for the rainy season to come, hence why both of the above ceremonies occurred a few months before the rainy season of summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Carrasco |first= David |date= 1981 |title= ''Religions of Mesoamerica''|publisher= Harper-Collins Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological findings ==

Due to the irregularities of the damage done to the walls of the enclosure, researchers have claimed that the damage was likely as a result of human contact, rather than natural phenomena. The site was originally covered with pieces of green stone, shards of pottery, and obsidian blades. The archaeologists claim that the site maybe have been used up until the end of the Christian era. The modern shrine that appears is currently at the summit was likely built around the 1970s as an aerial view of the ritual site in 1956 does not show the current statue.

'''Open energy system models''' are [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|models]] that are [[open source software|open source]].{{efn|
The terminology is not settled.  These models can also be known as '''open energy models''' or '''open source energy system models''' or some combination thereof.
}}  Similarly open energy system data employs [[open data]] methods to produce and distribute [[dataset]]s primarily for use by open energy system models.

Energy system models are used to explore future energy systems and are often applied to questions involving [[energy policy|energy]] and [[Politics of global warming|climate policy]].  The models themselves vary widely in terms of their type, design, programming, application, scope, level of detail, sophistication, and shortcomings.&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|238}}  For many models, some form of [[mathematical optimization]] is used to inform the solution process.

Several drivers favor the development of open models and open data.  There is an increasing interest in making [[public policy]] energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a desire to leverage the benefits that open data and [[open-source software development|open software development]] can bring, including reduced duplication of effort, better sharing of ideas and information, improved quality, and wider engagement and adoption.&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"/&gt;  Model development is therefore usually a [[collaborative software development model|team effort]] and constituted as either an academic project, a commercial venture, or a genuinely inclusive community initiative.

== General considerations ==

{{see also|Energy modeling|Open-source software development}}

=== Organization ===

An open energy system modeling project typically comprises a [[codebase]], [[dataset]]s, and [[software documentation]] and perhaps [[Scientific literature|scientific publications]].&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The project repository may be hosted on an institutional server or on a public [[Comparison of open source software hosting facilities|code-hosting site]], such as [[GitHub]].  Some projects release only their [[codebase]], while others ship some or all of their [[dataset]]s as well.  Projects may also offer [[Electronic mailing list|email lists]], [[Online chat|chat rooms]], and [[Internet forum|web forums]] to aid collaboration.

The majority of projects are based within university research groups, either singingly or as academic collaborations.

A 2017 paper lists the benefits of open data and models and discusses the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"&gt;

=== Growth ===

Open energy system modeling came of age in the 2010s.  Just two projects were cited in a 2011 paper on the topic: [[#OSeMOSYS|OSeMOSYS]] and [[#TEMOA|TEMOA]].&lt;ref name="howells-etal-2011"/&gt;{{rp|5861}}  [[#Balmorel|Balmorel]] was also active at that time, having been made public in 2001.{{efn|
[[#NEMO|NEMO]] was also under development in 2011 but it is unclear whether its codebase was public at that point.
}}  {{as of|2017|03}}, this article lists 25 such undertakings (with a further six waiting to be [[Talk:Open energy system models#Further models|added]]).

=== Transparency, comprehensibility, and reproducibility ===

{{see also|Open Energy Modelling Initiative#Context}}

The use of open energy system models and open energy data represents one attempt to improve the transparency, comprehensibility, and reproducibility of energy system models, particularly those used to aid public policy development.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"/&gt;

A 2010 paper concerning energy efficiency modeling argues that "an open peer review process can greatly support model verification and validation, which are essential for model development".&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010a"&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/ref&gt;  To further honor the process of [[peer review]], researchers argue, in a 2012 paper, that it is essential to place both the [[source code]] and [[dataset]]s under publicly accessible [[version control]] so that third-parties can run, verify, and scrutinize specific models.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"/&gt;  A 2016 paper contends that model-based energy scenario studies, seeking to influence decision-makers in government and industry, must become more comprehensible and more transparent.  To these ends, the paper provides a [[checklist]] of transparency criteria that should be completed by modelers.  The authors however state that they "consider open source approaches to be an extreme case of transparency that does not automatically facilitate the comprehensibility of studies for policy advice."&lt;ref name="cao-etal-2016"&gt;

=== State projects ===

State-sponsored open source projects in any domain are a relatively new phenomena.

{{as of|2017}}, the [[European Commission]] now supports several open source energy system modeling projects to aid the transition to a low-carbon energy system for Europe.  The Dispa-SET project ([[#Dispa-SET|below]]) is modeling the European electricity system and hosts its codebase on [[GitHub]].  The MEDEAS project, which will design and implement a new open source energy-economy model for Europe, held its kick-off meeting in February 2016.&lt;ref name="set-plan-2016-one"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  {{as of|2017|02}}, the project had yet to publish any source code.  The established OSeMOSYS project ([[#OSeMOSYS|below]]) is developing a multi-sector energy model for Europe with Commission funding to support stakeholder outreach.&lt;ref name="howells-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[National Energy Modeling System|NEMS]] national model is available but nonetheless difficult to use.  NEMS does not classify as an open source project in the accepted sense.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"/&gt;

== Open electricity sector models ==

Open electricity sector models are confined to just the electricity sector.  These models invariably have a temporal resolution of one hour or less.  Some models concentrate on the engineering characteristics of the system, including a good representation of [[Electric power transmission|high-voltage transmission networks]] and [[Power-flow study|AC power flow]].  Others models depict electricity [[spot market]]s and are known as dispatch models.  While other models embed [[Agent-based model|autonomous agents]] to capture, for instance, [[Auction|bidding decisions]] using techniques from [[bounded rationality]].  The ability to handle [[variable renewable energy]], transmission systems, and [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] are becoming important considerations.

DIETER stands for Dispatch and Investment Evaluation Tool with Endogenous Renewables.  DIETER is a dispatch and investment model. It was first used to study the role of [[Grid energy storage|power storage]] and other flexibility options in a future [[Greenfield project|greenfield]] setting with high shares of renewable generation.  DIETER is being developed at the [[German Institute for Economic Research]] (DIW), [[Berlin]], Germany.  The [[codebase]] and [[Data (computing)|datasets]] for Germany can be downloaded from the project website.  The basic model is fully described in a DIW working paper and a journal article.&lt;ref name="zerrahn-and-schill-2015"&gt;

DIETER is framed as a pure [[Linear programming|linear]] (no integer variables) cost minimization problem.  In the initial formulation, the decision variables include the investment in and dispatch of generation, storage, and [[Energy demand management|DSM]] capacities in the German wholesale and balancing electricity markets.

The first study using DIETER examines the power storage requirements for renewables uptake ranging from 60% to 100%.  Under the baseline scenario of 80% (the lower bound German government target for 2050), [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] requirements remain moderate and other options on both the supply side and demand side offer flexibility at low cost.  Nonetheless storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves.  Storage becomes more pronounced under higher shares of renewables, but strongly depends on the costs and availability of other flexibility options, particularly biomass availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schill|first=Wolf-Peter|last2=Zerrahn|first2=Alexander|title=Long-run power storage requirements for high shares of renewables: Results and sensitivities|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.205|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.205|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model power system is managed by a single operator with full knowledge of the economic and technical characteristics of the generation units, the loads at each node, and the heavily simplified transmission network.  Demand is deemed fully [[Elasticity (economics)|inelastic]].  The system is subject to intra-period and inter-period [[Unit commitment problem in electrical power production|unit commitment]] constraints (the latter covering nuclear and thermal generation for the most part) and operated under [[economic dispatch]].&lt;ref name="quoilin-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  Hourly data is used and the simulation horizon is normally one year.  But to ensure the model remains tractable, two day rolling horizon optimization is employed.

These policies may target renewable generation, {{CO2}} emissions, security of supply, and/or energy affordability.  The power companies are the main agents: they bid into power markets and they invest based on the [[net present value]] (NPV) of prospective power plant projects.  They can adopt a variety of technologies, using scenarios from the 2011 [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] [[World Energy Outlook]].&lt;ref name="iea-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The agent-based methodology enables different sets of assumptions to be tested, such as the heterogeneity of actors, the consequences of imperfect expectations, and the behavior of investors outside of ideal conditions.

EMLab-Generation offers a new way of modeling the effects of public policy on electricity markets.  It can provide insights into actor and system behaviors over time – including such things as investment cycles, abatement cycles, delayed responses, and the effects of uncertainty and risk on investment decisions.

A 2014 study using EMLab-Generation investigates the effects of introducing floor and ceiling prices for {{CO2}} under the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU ETS]].  And in particular, their influence on the dynamic investment pathway of two interlinked electricity markets (loosely Great Britain and Central Western Europe).  The study finds a common, moderate {{CO2}} auction reserve price results in a more continuous decarbonisation pathway and reduces {{CO2}} price volatility.  Adding a ceiling price can shield consumers from extreme price shocks.  Such price restrictions should not lead to an overshoot of emissions targets in the long-run.&lt;ref name="richstein-etal-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  EMMA is written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]] and uses the [[CPLEX]] commercial solver.

EMMA models electricity dispatch and investment, minimizing the total cost with respect to investment, generation, and trades between market areas.  In economic terms, EMMA classifies as a [[partial equilibrium]] model of the wholesale [[electricity market]] with a focus on the supply-side.  EMMA identifies short-term or long-term optima (or equilibria) and estimates the corresponding capacity mix, hourly prices, dispatch, and cross-border trading.  Technically, EMMA is a pure [[Linear programming|linear program]] (no integer variables) with about two million {{nowrap|non-zero}} variables.  {{as of|2016}}, the model covers Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland and supports conventional generation, renewable generation, and [[cogeneration]].&lt;ref name="hirth-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hirth-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Detailed descriptions of the software are available.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2016"/&gt;  GENESYS is written in [[C++]] and uses [[Boost (C++ libraries)|Boost]] libraries, the [[MySQL]] relational database, the [[Qt (software)|Qt{{nbsp}}4]] application framework, and optionally the [[CPLEX]] solver.

The GENESYS simulation tool is designed to optimize a future EUMENA (Europe, Middle East, and North Africa) power system and assumes a high share of renewable generation.  It is able to find an economically optimal distribution of generator, storage, and transmission capacities within a 21{{nbsp}}region EUMENA.  It allows for the optimization of this energy system in combination with an evolutionary method.  The optimization is based on a [[CMA-ES|covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy]] (CMA-ES), while the operation is simulated as a hierarchical set-up of system elements which balance the load between the various regions at minimum cost using the [[network simplex algorithm]].  GENESYS ships with a set of input time series and a set of parameters for the year 2050, which the user can modify.

A future EUMENA energy supply system with a high share of renewable energy sources (RES) will need a strongly interconnected energy transport grid and significant energy storage capacities.  GENESYS was used to dimension the storage and transmission between the 21{{nbsp}}different regions.  Under the assumption of 100% self-supply, about {{val|2500|u=GW}} of RES in total and a storage capacity of about {{val|240000|u=GWh}} are needed, corresponding to 6% of the annual energy demand, and a HVDC transmission grid of {{val|375000|u=GW·km}}.  The combined cost estimate for generation, storage, and transmission, excluding distribution, is 6.87{{nbsp}}¢/kWh.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2014"&gt;

A 2016 study looked at the relationship between storage and transmission capacity under high shares of renewable energy sources (RES) in an EUMENA power system.  It found that, up to a certain extent, transmission capacity and storage capacity can substitute for each other.  For a transition to a fully renewable energy system by 2050, major structural changes are required.  The results indicate the optimal allocation of photovoltaics and wind power, the resulting demand for storage capacities of different technologies (battery, pumped hydro, and hydrogen storage) and the capacity of the transmission grid.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2016"&gt;

NEMO, the National Electricity Market Optimiser, is a chronological dispatch model for testing and optimizing different portfolios of conventional and renewable electricity generation technologies.  It applies solely to the Australian [[National Electricity Market]] (NEM), which, despite its name, is limited to east and south Australia.  NEMO has been in development at the [http://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/ Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets] (CEEM), [[University of New South Wales]] (UNSW), [[Sydney]], Australia since 2011.&lt;ref name="nemo-website"&gt;

The solution space of generator capacities is searched using the [[CMA-ES]] (covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy) algorithm.  The timestep is arbitrary but one hour is normally employed.

NEMO has been used to explore generation options for the year 2030 under a variety of renewable energy (RE) and abated fossil fuel technology scenarios.  A 2012 study investigates the feasibility of a fully renewable system using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) with thermal storage, [[Wind power|windfarms]], [[photovoltaics]], existing [[hydroelectricity]], and [[biofuel]]led [[gas turbine]]s.  A number of potential systems, which also meet NEM reliability criteria, are identified.  The principal challenge is servicing peak demand on winter evenings following overcast days and periods of low wind.&lt;ref name="elliston-etal-2012"&gt;

OnSSET is the OpeN Source Spatial Electrification Toolkit.  OnSSET is being developed by the [https://www.kth.se/en/itm/inst/energiteknik/forskning/desa Energy Systems Analysis Group] (dESA), [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], [[Stockholm]], Sweden.  The software is used to examine areas not served by grid-based electricity and identify the technology options and investment requirements that will provide least-cost access to electricity services.  OnSSET is designed to support the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals|SDG{{nnbsp}}7]]: the provision of affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.  The [[Python (programming language)|Python]] implementation of the toolkit is known as PyOnSSET and was released on 26{{nbsp}}November 2016.  PyOnSSET does not ship with data, but suitable datasets are available from [[Open energy system databases#energydata.info|energydata.info]].  The project maintains a website and hosts a forum on [[Reddit]].&lt;ref name="onsset-website"&gt;

pandapower is a power system analysis and optimization program being jointly developed by the Energy Management and Power System Operation research group, [[University of Kassel]] and the Department for Distribution System Operation, [[Fraunhofer Institute]] for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology (IEE), both of [[Kassel]], Germany.  The codebase is hosted on [[GitHub]] and is also available as a [[Python Package Index|package]].  The project maintains a website, an [[Electronic mailing list|emailing list]], and online documentation.  pandapower is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  It uses the [[pandas (software)|pandas]] library for data manipulation and analysis and the PYPOWER library{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="pypower-website"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; to solve for [[Power-flow study|power flow]].  Unlike some open source power system tools, pandapower does not depend on proprietary platforms like [[MATLAB]].

pandapower supports the automated analysis and optimization of [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] and transmission networks.  This allows a large of number of scenarios to be explored, based on different future grid configurations and technologies.  pandapower offers a collection of power system elements, including: lines, 2-winding transformers, 3-winding transformers, and ward-equivalents.  It also contains a switch model that allows the modeling of ideal bus-bus switches as well as bus-line/bus-trafo switches.  The software supports topological searching.  The network itself can be plotted, with or without geographical information, using the [[matplotlib]] and [[plotly]] libraries.

A 2016 publication evaluates the usefulness of the software by undertaking several case studies with major distribution system operators (DSO).  These studies examine the integration of increasing levels of [[photovoltaics]] into existing distribution grids.  The study concludes that being able to test a large number of detailed scenarios is essential for robust grid planning.  Notwithstanding, issues of data availability and problem dimensionality will continue to present challenges.&lt;ref name="scheidler-etal-2016"&gt;

A 2018 paper describes the package and its design and provides an example case study.  The article explains how users work with an element-based model (EBM) which is converted internally to a bus-branch model (BBM) for computation.  The package supports power system simulation, optimal power flow calculations (cost information is required), state estimation (should the system characterization lacks fidelity), and [[graph theory|graph]]-based network analysis.  The case study shows how a few tens of lines of scripting can interface with pandapower to advance the design of a system subject to diverse operating requirements.  The associated code is hosted on GitHub as [[Project Jupyter|jupyter notebooks]].&lt;ref name="thurner-etal-2018"&gt;

The PowerMatcher software implements a [[smart grid]] coordination mechanism which balances [[Distributed generation|distributed energy resources]] (DER) and flexible loads through autonomous [[bidding]].  The project is managed by the Flexiblepower Alliance Network (FAN) in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands.  The project maintains a website and the [[source code]] is hosted on [[GitHub]].  {{as of|2016|06}}, existing datasets are not available.  PowerMatcher is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

Each device in the smart grid system – whether a washing machine, a wind generator, or an industrial turbine – expresses its willingness to consume or produce electricity in the form of a bid.  These bids are then collected and used to determine an equilibrium price.  The PowerMatcher software thereby allows high shares of renewable energy to be integrated into existing electricity systems and should also avoid any local overloading in possibly aging distribution networks.&lt;ref name="kok-2013"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  {{as of|2015}}, renpass is being extended as renpassG!S, based on [[#oemof|oemof]].

renpass is an electricity dispatch model which minimizes system costs for each time step (optimization) within the limits of a given infrastructure (simulation).  Time steps are optionally 15 minutes or one hour.  The method assumes perfect foresight.  renpass supports the electricity systems found in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland.

The optimization problem for each time step is to minimize the electricity supply cost using the existing power plant fleet for all regions.  After this regional dispatch, the exchange between the regions is carried out and is restricted by the grid capacity.  This latter problem is solved with a heuristic procedure rather than calculated deterministically.  The input is the merit order, the marginal power plant, the excess energy (renewable energy that could be curtailed), and the excess demand (the demand that cannot be supplied) for each region.  The exchange algorithm seeks the least cost for all regions, thus the target function is to minimize the total costs of all regions, given the existing grid infrastructure, storage, and generating capacities.  The total cost is defined as the residual load multiplied by the price in each region, summed over all regions.

A 2012 study uses renpass to examine the feasibility of a 100% renewable electricity system for the [[Baltic Sea]] region (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden) in the year 2050.  The base scenario presumes conservative renewable potentials and grid enhancements, a 20% drop in demand, a moderate uptake of storage options, and the deployment of biomass for flexible generation.  The study finds that a 100% renewable electricity system is possible, albeit with occasional imports from abutting countries, and that biomass plays a key role in system stability.  The costs for this transition are estimated at 50{{nbsp}}€/MWh.&lt;ref name="bernhardi-etal-2012"&gt;

SciGRID, short for Scientific Grid, is an open source model of the German and European [[Electric power transmission|electricity transmission networks]].  The research project is managed by [http://www.next-energy.de/en/ Next Energy] (officially the EWE Research Centre for Energy Technology) located at the [[University of Oldenburg]], [[Oldenburg (Oldenburg)|Oldenburg]], Germany.  The project maintains a website and an email newsletter.  SciGRID is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses a [[PostgreSQL]] database.  The first release (v0.1) was made on 15{{nbsp}}June 2015.

SciGRID aims to rectify the lack of open research data on the structure of electricity transmission networks within Europe.  This lack of data frustrates attempts to build, characterise, and compare high resolution energy system models.  SciGRID utilizes transmission network data available from the [[OpenStreetMap]] project, available under the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL), to automatically author transmission connections.  SciGRID will not use data from closed sources.  SciGRID can also mathematically decompose a given network into a simpler representation for use in energy models.&lt;ref name="matke-etal-2015"&gt;

SWITCH is a loose acronym for solar, wind, conventional and hydroelectric generation, and transmission.  SWITCH is an optimal planning model for power systems with large shares of renewable energy.  SWITCH is being developed by the Department of Electrical Engineering, [[University of Hawai'i]], [[Mānoa]], [[Hawaii]], USA.  The project runs a small website and hosts its [[codebase]] and [[Data (computing)|datasets]] on [[GitHub]].  SWITCH is written in [[Pyomo]], an optimization components library programmed in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  It can use either the open source [[GLPK]] solver or the commercial [[CPLEX]] and [[Gurobi]] solvers.

SWITCH is a power system model, focused on renewables integration.  It can identify which generator and transmission projects to build in order to satisfy electricity demand at the lowest cost over a several year period while also reducing {{CO2}} emissions.  SWITCH utilizes multi-stage [[Stochastic linear program|stochastic linear optimization]] with the objective of minimizing the present value of the cost of power plants, transmission capacity, fuel usage, and an arbitrary per-tonne {{CO2}} charge (to represent either a carbon tax or a certificate price), over the course of a multi-year investment period.  It has two major sets of decision variables.  First, at the start of each investment period, SWITCH selects how much generation capacity to build in each of several geographic load zones, how much power transfer capability to add between these zones, and whether to operate existing generation capacity during the investment period or to temporarily mothball it to avoid fixed operation and maintenance costs.  Second, for a set of sample days within each investment period, SWITCH makes hourly decisions about how much power to generate from each dispatchable power plant, store at each [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped hydro]] facility, or transfer along each transmission interconnector.  The system must also ensure enough generation and transmission capacity to provide a planning reserve margin of 15% above the load forecasts.  For each sampled hour, SWITCH uses electricity demand and renewable power production based on actual measurements, so that the weather-driven correlations between these elements remain intact.

Following the optimization phase, SWITCH is used in a second phase to test the proposed investment plan against a more complete set of weather conditions and to add backstop generation capacity so that the planning reserve margin is always met.  Finally, in a third phase, the costs are calculated by freezing the investment plan and operating the proposed power system over a full set of weather conditions.

A 2012 paper uses [[California]] from 2012 to 2027 as a [[case study]] for SWITCH.  The study finds that there is no ceiling on the amount of wind and solar power that could be used and that these resources could potentially reduce emissions by 90% or more (relative to 1990 levels) without reducing reliability or severely raising costs.  Furthermore, policies that encourage electricity customers to shift demand to times when renewable power is most abundant (for example, though the well-timed charging of [[electric vehicle]]s) could achieve radical emission reductions at moderate cost.&lt;ref name="fripp-2012"&gt;

URBS, [[Latin]] for city, is a [[linear programming]] model for exploring capacity expansion and unit commitment problems and is particularly suited to [[Distributed generation|distributed energy systems]] (DES).  It is being developed by the [https://www.ens.ei.tum.de/en/ Institute for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Systems], [[Technical University of Munich]], Germany.  The [[codebase]] is hosted on [[GitHub]].  URBS is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] optimization packages.

URBS classes as an energy modeling framework and attempts to minimize the total discounted cost of the system.  A particular model selects from a set of technologies to meet a predetermined electricity demand.  It uses a time resolution of one hour and the spatial resolution is model-defined.  The decision variables are the capacities for the production, storage, and transport of electricity and the time scheduling for their operation.&lt;ref name="huber-etal-2012"&gt;

== Open energy system models ==

Open energy system models capture some or all of the energy commodities found in an energy system.  All models include the electricity sector.  Some models add the heat sector, which can be important for countries with significant [[district heating]].  Other models add gas networks.  With the advent of [[Electric vehicle|emobility]], other models still include aspects of the transport sector.  Indeed, coupling these various sectors using [[power-to-X]] technologies is an emerging area of research.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2014"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  These ambitions and limitations have long since been superseded and Balmorel is no longer tied to its original geography and policy questions.&lt;ref name="ravn-2012"/&gt;  Balmorel classes as a dispatch and investment model and uses a time resolution of one hour.  It models electricity and heat supply and demand, and supports the intertemporal storage of both.  Balmorel is structured as a pure [[linear programming|linear program]] (no integer variables).

{{as of|2016}}, Balmorel has been the subject of some 22{{nbsp}}publications.  A 2008 study uses Balmorel to explore the Nordic energy system in 2050.  The focus is on renewable energy supply and the deployment of hydrogen as the main transport fuel.  Given certain assumptions about the future price of oil and carbon and the uptake of hydrogen, the model shows that it is economically optimal to cover, using renewable energy, more than 95% of the primary energy consumption for electricity and district heat and 65% of the transport.&lt;ref name="karlsson-and-meibom-2008"&gt;

Calliope is an energy system modeling framework, with a focus on flexibility, high spatial and temporal resolution, and the ability to execute different runs using the same base-case dataset.  The project is being developed at the [https://www.usys.ethz.ch/en/ Department of Environmental Systems Science], [[ETH Zurich]], [[Zürich]], Switzerland.  The project maintains a website, hosts the [[codebase]] at [[GitHub]], operates an [https://github.com/calliope-project/calliope/issues issues tracker], and runs two [[Electronic mailing list|email lists]].  Calliope is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] library.  It can link to the open source [[GLPK]] solver and the commercial [[CPLEX]] and [[Gurobi]] solvers.

&lt;/ref&gt;

A Calliope model consists of a collection of structured text files, in [[YAML]] and [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] formats, that define the technologies, locations, and resource potentials.  Calliope takes these files, constructs a pure [[Linear programming|linear optimization]] (no integer variables) problem, solves it, and reports the results in the form of [[pandas (software)|pandas]] [[data structures]] for analysis.  The framework contains five [[Abstract type|abstract]] base technologies – supply, demand, conversion, storage, transmission – from which new concrete technologies can be derived.  The design of Calliope enforces the clear separation of framework (code) and model (data).

A 2015 study uses Calliope to compare the future roles of [[nuclear power]] and [[Concentrated solar power|CSP]] in [[South Africa]].  It finds CSP could be competitive with nuclear by 2030 for baseload and more competitive when producing above baseload.  CSP also offers less investment risk, less environmental risk, and other co-benefits.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-and-keirstead-2015-a"&gt;

DESSTinEE stands for Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in EuropE.  DESSTinEE is a model of the European energy system in 2050 with a focus on the electricity system.  DESSTinEE is being developed primarily at the [[Imperial College Business School]], [[Imperial College London]] (ICL), [[London]], United Kingdom.  The software can be downloaded from the project website.  DESSTinEE is written in [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]/[[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]] and comprises a set of standalone [[spreadsheet]]s.  A flier is available.&lt;ref name="desstinee-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

DESSTinEE is designed to investigate assumptions about the technical requirements for energy transport – particularly electricity – and the scale of the economic challenge to develop the necessary infrastructure.  Forty countries are considered in and around Europe and ten forms of primary and secondary energy are supported.  The model uses a predictive simulation technique, rather than solving for either [[Partial equilibrium|partial]] or [[Computable general equilibrium|general equilibrium]].  The model projects annual energy demands for each country to 2050, synthesizes hourly profiles for electricity demand in 2010 and 2050, and simulates the least-cost generation and transmission of electricity around the region.&lt;ref name="openmod-wiki-desstinee"&gt;

A 2016 study using DESSTinEE (and a second model eLOAD) examines the evolution of electricity load curves in Germany and Britain from the present until 2050.  In 2050, peak loads and ramp rates rise 20–60% and system utilization falls 15–20%, in part due to the substantial uptake of [[heat pump]]s and [[electric vehicle]]s.  These are significant changes.&lt;ref name="bossmann-and-staffell-2016"&gt;

The Energy Transition Model (ETM) is an interactive web-based model using a holistic description of a country's energy system.  It is being developed by Quintel Intelligence, [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands.  The project maintains a project website, an interactive website, and a [[GitHub]] repository.  ETM is written in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] (on [[Ruby on Rails|Rails]]) and displays in a [[web browser]].  ETM consists of several software components as described in the documentation.

ETM is fully interactive.  After selecting a region (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, United Kingdom, EU-27, or Brazil) and a year (2020, 2030, 2040, or 2050), the user can set 300 sliders (or enter numerical values) to explore the following:

* targets: set goals for the scenario and see if they can be achieved, targets comprise: {{CO2}} reductions, renewables shares, total cost, and caps on imports 
* demands: expand or restrict energy demand in the future
* costs: project the future costs of energy carriers and energy technologies, these costs do not include taxes or subsidies
* supplies: select which technologies can be used to produce heat or electricity

ETM is based on an energy graph ([[Directed graph|digraph]]) where nodes ([[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]]) can convert from one type of energy to another, possibly with losses.  The connections ([[Glossary of graph theory#edge|directed edges]]) are the energy flows and are characterized by volume (in [[megajoule]]s) and carrier type (such as coal, electricity, usable-heat, and so forth).  Given a demand and other choices, ETM calculates the primary energy use, the total cost, and the resulting {{CO2}} emissions.  The model is demand driven, meaning that the digraph is traversed from ''useful demand'' (such as space heating, hot water usage, and car-kilometers) to ''primary demand'' (the extraction of gas, the import of coal, and so forth).

EnergyPATHWAYS is a bottom-up energy sector model used to explore the near-term implications of long-term deep decarbonization.  The lead developer is energy and climate protection consultancy, Evolved Energy Research, [[San Francisco]], USA.  The code is hosted on [[GitHub]].  EnergyPATHWAYS is written in [[Python (computer language)|Python]] and links to the open source [[COIN-OR#CBC|Cbc]] solver.  Alternatively, the [[GLPK]], [[CPLEX]], or [[Gurobi]] solvers can be employed.  EnergyPATHWAYS utilizes the [[PostgreSQL]] [[object-relational database management system]] (ORDBMS) to manage its [[Data (computing)|data]].

EnergyPATHWAYS is a comprehensive accounting framework used to construct economy-wide energy infrastructure scenarios.  While portions of the model do use [[linear programming]] techniques, for instance, for electricity dispatch, the EnergyPATHWAYS model is not fundamentally an optimization model and embeds few decision dynamics.  EnergyPATHWAYS offers detailed energy, cost, and emissions accounting for the energy flows from primary supply to final demand.  The energy system representation is flexible, allowing for differing levels of detail and the nesting of cities, states, and countries.  The model uses hourly least-cost electricity dispatch and supports [[power-to-gas]], short-duration energy storage, long-duration energy storage, and [[demand response]].  Scenarios typically run to 2050.

A predecessor of the EnergyPATHWAYS software, named simply PATHWAYS, has been used to construct policy models.  The California PATHWAYS model was used to inform Californian state climate targets for 2030.&lt;ref name="williams-etal-2012"&gt;

ETEM is a bottom-up model that identifies the optimal energy and technology options for a regional or city.  The model finds an energy policy with minimal cost, while investing in new equipment (new technologies), developing production capacity (installed technologies), and/or proposing the feasible import/export of primary energy.  ETEM typically casts forward 50{{nbsp}}years, in two or five year steps, with time slices of four seasons using typically individual days or finer.  The spatial resolution can be highly detailed.  Electricity and heat are both supported, as are [[district heating]] networks, household energy systems, and grid storage, including the use of [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]] (PHEV).  ETEM-SG, a development, supports [[demand response]], an option which would be enabled by the development of [[smart grid]]s.

The ETEM model has been applied to Luxembourg, the Geneva and Basel-Bern-Zurich cantons in Switzerland, and the Grenoble metropolitan and Midi-Pyrénées region in France.  A 2005 study uses ETEM to study climate protection in the Swiss housing sector.  The ETEM model was coupled with the GEMINI-E3 world [[Computable general equilibrium|computable general equilibrium model]] (CGEM) to complete the analysis.&lt;ref name="drouet-etal-2005"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 study examines the design of [[smart grid]]s.  As distribution systems become more intelligent, so must the models needed to analysis them.  ETEM is used to assess the potential of smart grid technologies using a [[case study]], roughly calibrated on the [[Geneva]] canton, under three scenarios.  These scenarios apply different constraints on {{CO2}} emissions and electricity imports.  A stochastic approach is used to deal with the uncertainty in future electricity prices and the uptake of electric vehicles.&lt;ref name="babonneau-2012"&gt;

ficus is a [[Mixed integer program|mixed integer]] optimization model for local energy systems.  It is being developed at the [https://www.ewk.ei.tum.de/en/startseite/ Institute for Energy Economy and Application Technology], [[Technical University of Munich]], [[Munich]], Germany.  The project maintains a website.  The project is hosted on [[GitHub]].  ficus is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] library.  The user can choose between the open source [[GLPK]] solver or the commercial [[CPLEX]] and [[Gurobi]] solvers.

Based on [[#URBS|URBS]], ficus was originally developed for optimizing the energy systems of factories and has now been extended to include local energy systems.  ficus supports multiple energy commodities – goods that can be imported or exported, generated, stored, or consumed – including electricity and heat.  It supports multiple-input and multiple-output energy conversion technologies with load-dependent efficiencies.  The objective of the model is to supply the given demand at minimal cost.  ficus uses exogenous cost time series for imported commodities as well as peak demand charges with a configurable timebase for each commodity in use.

oemof classes as an energy modeling framework.  It consists of a [[Linear programming|linear]] or [[Mixed integer program|mixed integer]] optimization problem formulation library (solph), an input data generation library (feedin-data), and other auxiliary libraries.  The solph library is used to represent multi-regional and multi-sectoral (electricity, heat, gas, mobility) systems and can optimize for different targets, such as financial cost or {{CO2}} emissions.  Furthermore, it is possible to switch between dispatch and investment modes.  In terms of scope, oemof can capture the European power system or alternatively it can describe a complex local power and heat sector scheme.

OSeMOSYS stands for Open Source Energy Modelling System.  OSeMOSYS is intended for national and regional policy development and uses an intertemperal optimization framework.  The model posits a single socially motivated operator/investor with perfect foresight.  The OSeMOSYS project is a community endeavor, supported by the Energy Systems Analysis Group (dESA), [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], [[Stockholm]], Sweden.  The project maintains a website providing background. The project also offers several active [[internet forum]]s on [[Reddit]].  OSeMOSYS was originally written in [[MathProg]], a high-level [[Mathematical optimization|mathematical programming]] language.  It was subsequently reimplemented in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and all three codebases are now maintained.  The project also provides a test model called UTOPIA.&lt;ref name="lavigne-2017"/&gt;  A manual is available.&lt;ref name="moksnes-etal-2015"&gt;

OSeMOSYS provides a framework for the analysis of energy systems over the medium (10–15 years) and long term (50–100 years).  OSeMOSYS uses pure [[Linear programming|linear optimization]], with the option of [[mixed integer programming]] for the treatment of, for instance, discrete power plant capacity expansions.  It covers most energy sectors, including heat, electricity, and transport.  OSeMOSYS is driven by exogenously defined [[Energy system#Energy-services|energy services]] demands.  These are then met through a set of technologies which draw on a set of resources, both characterized by their potentials and costs.  These resources are not limited to energy commodities and may include, for example, water and [[Land use, land-use change and forestry|land-use]].  This enables OSeMOSYS to be applied in domains other than energy, such as water systems.  Technical constraints, economic restrictions, and/or environmental targets may also be imposed to reflect policy considerations.  OSeMOSYS is available in extended and compact MathProg formulations, either of which should give identical results.  In its extended version, OSeMOSYS comprises a little more than 400 [[Source lines of code|lines of code]].

PyPSA stands for Python for Power System Analysis.  PyPSA is a free software toolbox for simulating and optimizing electric power systems and allied sectors.  It supports conventional generation, variable wind and solar generation, electricity storage, [[Power-to-X#Sector coupling concepts|coupling]] to the natural gas, hydrogen, heat, and transport sectors, and hybrid alternating and direct current networks.  Moreover, PyPSA is designed to scale well.  The project is managed by the [https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/index.php Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics] (IAI), [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT), [[Karlsruhe]], Germany, although the project itself exists independently under its own name and accounts.  The project maintains a website and runs an [[Electronic mailing list|email list]].  PyPSA itself is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] library.  The [[source code]] is hosted on [[GitHub]] and is also released periodically as a [[Python Package Index|PyPI]] package.

[[File:Simulated locational marginal prices produced by PyPSA energy system model.svg|thumb|left|Simulated [[Electricity market#Bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices|locational marginal prices]] across [[Germany]] under conditions of high wind and low load.  Bottlenecks in north/south power transmission elicit the large differences.&lt;ref name="brown-etal-2018-pypsa"/&gt;{{rp|11}}]]

The basic functionality of PyPSA is described in a 2018 paper.  PyPSA sits between traditional steady-state power flow analysis software and full multi-period energy system models.  It can be invoked using either non-linear power flow equations for system simulation or linearized approximations to enable the joint optimization of operations and investment across multiple periods.  Generator ramping and multi-period up and down-times can be specified, [[demand side management|DSM]] is supported, but demand remains [[price elasticity of demand|price inelastic]].&lt;ref name="brown-etal-2018-pypsa"&gt;

A 2018 study examines potential synergies between [[power-to-X#sector coupling concepts|sector coupling]] and [[electric power transmission|transmission]] reinforcement in a future European energy system constrained to reduce [[carbon dioxide equivalent|carbon]] emissions by 95%.  The PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30 model captures the [[energy demand management|demand-side management]] potential of [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEV) as well as the role that [[power-to-gas]], long-term [[thermal energy storage]], and related technologies can play.  Results indicate that BEVs can smooth the daily variations in solar power while the remaining technologies smooth the [[wiktionary:synoptic|synoptic]] and seasonal variations in both demand and renewable supply.  Substantial [[wiktionary:buildout|buildout]] of the electricity grid is required for a least-cost configuration.  More generally, such a system is both feasible and affordable.  The underlying datasets are available from [[Zenodo]].&lt;ref name="brown-etal-2018-synergies"&gt;

TEMOA stands for Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis.  The software is being developed by the Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, [[North Carolina State University]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], USA.  The project runs a website and a forum.  The [[source code]] is hosted on [[GitHub]].  The model is programmed in [[Pyomo]], an optimization components library written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  TEMOA can be used with any solver that [[Pyomo]] supports, including the open source [[GLPK]] solver.  TEMOA uses [[version control]] to publicly archive [[source code]] and [[Data (computing)|datasets]] and thereby enable third-parties to verify all published modeling work.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"&gt;

=== Component models ===

A number of technical component models are now also open source.  While these component models do not constitute systems models aimed at public policy development (the focus of this page), they nonetheless warrant a mention.  Component models can be linked or otherwise adapted into these broader initiatives.

=== Open solvers ===

Many projects rely on a [[Linear programming|pure linear]] or [[Mixed integer program|mixed integer]] solver to perform classical optimization, constraint satisfaction, or some mix of the two.  While there are several open source solver projects, the most commonly deployed solver is [[GLPK]].  GLPK has been adopted by [[#Calliope|Calliope]], [[#ETEM|ETEM]], [[#ficus|ficus]], [[#OSeMOSYS|OSeMOSYS]], [[#SWITCH|SWITCH]], and [[#TEMOA|TEMOA]].  Another alternative is the Clp solver.&lt;ref name="clp-homepage"&gt;

'''Pit water''', '''mine water''' or '''mining water''' is [[water]] that collects in a [[mining|mine]] and which has to be brought to the surface by [[water management]] methods in order to enable the mine to continue working.

== Origin ==
Although all water that enters pit workings originates from [[atmospheric precipitation]], the miner distinguishes between [[surface water]] and [[groundwater]]. Surface water enters the pit through openings in the mine at the surface of the ground, such as tunnel portals or shaft entrances. During heavy rain, water seeps into the earth and forms ground water when it meets layers of impervious rock. Pit water is mainly [[interstitial water]] and groundwater that seeps into the [[mine workings]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Hartmann: Handwörterbuch der Berg-, Hütten- u.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20249">'''Premelting''' (also '''surface melting''') refers to a [[quasi-liquid]] film than can occur on the surface of a solid even below melting point (&lt;math&gt;T_m&lt;/math&gt;).  The thickness of the film is temperature (&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;) dependent. This effect is common for all crystalline materials. 
Premelting shows its effects in [[frost heave]], the growth of [[snowflake]]s and, taking grain boundary interfaces into account, maybe even in the movement of [[glaciers]].

Considering a solid-vapour interface, complete and incomplete premelting can be distinguished. During a temperature rise from below to above &lt;math&gt; T_m &lt;/math&gt;, in the case of complete premelting, the solid melts homogeneously from the outside to the inside; in the case of incomplete premelting, the liquid film stays very thin during the beginning of the melting process, but droplets start to form on the interface. In either case, the solid always melts from the outside inwards, never from the inside.

==History==
The first to mention premelting might have been [[Michael Faraday]] in 1842 for ice surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Faraday |first= Michael |date= 1933  |title= Faraday’s Diary |url= https://archive.org/stream/faradaysdiarybei00fara_2#page/78/mode/2up |location= London, England |publisher= Bell and Sons |volume= vol. IV |page= 79 (entry for September 8, 1842) |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compared the effect which holds a snowball together to that which makes buildings from moistured sand stable. Another interesting thing he mentioned is that two blocks of ice can freeze together. Later Tammann and Stranski suggested that all surfaces might, due to the reduction of surface energy, start melting at their surfaces. Frenkel strengthened this by noting that, in contrast to liquids, no overheating can be found for solids. After extensive studies on many materials, it can be concluded that it is a common attribute of the solid state that the melting process begins at the surface.&lt;ref name=Da&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dash |first=J.G. |title=The physics of premelted ice and its geophysical consequences |journal=Rev Mod Phys |volume=78 |date=2006 |pages=695 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.78.695 |last2=Rempel |first2=A. |last3=Wettlaufer |first3=J. |bibcode=2006RvMP...78..695D |issue=3|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.1061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical explanations==
There are several ways to approach the topic of premelting the most figurative way might be thermodynamically. A more detailed or abstract view on what physics is important for premelting is given by the Lifshitz and the Landau theories.
One always starts with looking at a crystalline solid phase (fig. 1: (1) solid) and another phase. This second phase (fig. 1: (2)) can either be [[vapour]], [[liquid]] or [[solid]]. Further it can consist of the same chemical material or another. In the case of the second phase being a solid of the same chemical material one speaks of grain boundaries. This case is very important when looking at polycrystalline materials.

=== Thermodynamical picture for solid gas interface===
[[Image:Premelting1.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Boundary between phase (1) and phase (2) without and with intermediate phase (3)]]
In the following thermodynamical equilibrium is assumed, as well as for simplicity (2) should be a vaporous phase.

The first (1) and the second (2) phase are always divided by some form of interface, what results in an [[surface energy|interfacial energy]] &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{1-2} &lt;/math&gt;. One can now ask whether this energy can be lowered by inserting a third phase (l) in between (1) and (2). Written in interfacial energies this would mean:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{1-2} &gt;  \gamma_{1-l} + \gamma_{l-2} &lt;/math&gt;
|}
If this is the case then it is more efficient for the system to form a separating phase (3). The only possibility for the system to form such a layer is to take material of the solid and "melt" it to a quasi-liquid. In further notation there will be no distinction between quasi-liquid and liquid but one should always keep in mind that there is a difference. This difference to a real liquid becomes clear when looking at a very thin layer (l). As, due to the long range forces of the molecules of the solid material the liquid very near the solid still "feels" the order of crystalline solid and hence itself is in a state providing a not liquid like amount of order. As considering a very thin layer at the moment it is clear that the whole separating layer (l) is too well ordered for a liquid. Further comments on ordering can be found in the paragraph on [[Landau theory]].

Now, looking closer at the thermodynamics of the newly introduced phase (l), its [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]] can be written as:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt; G \left(T,P,d\right)= \left( n_{l}\mu_{l}\left(T,P\right) \right)d + \gamma_{total}\left(d\right) &lt;/math&gt;
|}
Were  &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; the pressure, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; the thickness of (l) corresponding to the number or particles &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; in this case. &lt;math&gt;n_{l}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_{l}&lt;/math&gt;  are the atomic density and the chemical potential in (l) and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{total}=\gamma_{1-l} + \gamma_{l-2} &lt;/math&gt;. Note that one has to consider that the interfacial energies can just be added to the Gibbs energy in this case. As noted before &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; corresponds &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; so the derivation to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; results in:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt; \mu \left(T,P,d\right)= \mu_{l}\left(T,P\right) + \frac{\Delta \gamma}{n_{l}} \frac{\partial f\left(d\right)}{\partial d} = \mu_{1} &lt;/math&gt;
|}
Where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{total}= \Delta \gamma_{1-l} \cdot f\left(d\right) + \gamma_{1-2} &lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt; \mu_{1} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu_{l} &lt;/math&gt; differ and &lt;math&gt; \Delta \mu= \mu_{1} - \mu_{l} &lt;/math&gt; can be defined. Assuming that a Taylor expansion around the melting point &lt;math&gt; \left(T_m,P_m\right) &lt;/math&gt; is possible and using the [[Clausius–Clapeyron equation]] one can get the following results:
* For a long range potential assuming &lt;math&gt; f\left(d\right)=1- \sigma^2/d^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; d &gt;&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt; \left(d= -\frac{2 \sigma^{2} \Delta \gamma}{n_{l} q_{m} t}\right)^{1/3} &lt;/math&gt;

*For short range potential of the form &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial f}{\partial d} ~ e^{-d/d_{0}} &lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt; d \propto \left| ln \left|t\right| \right| &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is in the order of molecular dimensions &lt;math&gt; q_{m} &lt;/math&gt; the specific melting heat and &lt;math&gt; t= \frac{T_{m}-T}{T_{m}} &lt;/math&gt;

These formulas also show that the more the temperature increases, the more increases the thickness of the premelt as this is energetically advantageous. This is the explanation why no [[Thermal shock|overheating]] exists for this type of phase transition.&lt;ref name=Da/&gt;

===Lifshitz theory: Complete and incomplete premelting===
With the help of the [[Evgeny Lifshitz|Lifshitz]] Theory on Casimir, respectively van der Waals, interactions of macroscopic bodies premelting can be viewed from an electrodynamical perspective.
A good example for determining the difference between complete and incomplete premelting is ice. From [[UV|VUV]] frequencies on the polarizability of ice is greater than that of water, at lower frequencies this is vice versa. Assuming there is already a film of thickness d on the solid it is easy for any components for electromagnetic waves to travel through the film in the direction perpendicular to the solid surface as long d is small. Hence as long as the film is thin compared to the frequency interaction from the solid to the whole film is possible. But when d gets large against typical VUV frequencies the electronic structure of the film will be too slow to promote the high frequencies to the other end of the liquid phase. Thus this end of the liquid phase feels only a retarded van der Waals interaction from the solid phase. Hence the attraction between the liquid molecules themselves will outweigh and they will start forming droplets instead to thicken the film further. So the speed of light limits complete premelting.
This makes it a question of solid and surface free energies whether complete premelting occurs. Complete surface melting will occur when &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{total}\left(d\right) &lt;/math&gt; is monotonically decreasing. If &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{total}\left(d\right) &lt;/math&gt; instead shows a global minimum at finite d than the premelting will be incomplete.
This implies: When the long range interactions in the system are attractive than there will be incomplete premelting — assuming the film thickness is larger than any repulsive interactions. Is the film thickness small compared to the range of the repulsive interactions present and the repulsive interactions are stronger than the attractive ones than complete premelting can occur.
For [[van der Waals interactions]] Lifshitz theory can now calculate which type of premelting should occur for a special system. In fact small differences in systems can affect the type of premelting. For example, ice in an atmosphere of water vapour shows incomplete premelting, whereas the premelting of ice in air is complete.

For solid–solid interfaces it cannot be predicted in general whether the premelting is complete or incomplete when only considering van der Waals interactions. Here other types of interactions become very important. This also accounts for grain boundaries.&lt;ref name=Da/&gt;

===Landau theory===
[[Image:Premelting2.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A qualitative picture of the order parameter of a premelting solid for temperatures below the melting point. One can see that there is still a high amount of order in the liquid, which decreases with rising Temperature]]
Most insight in the problem probably emerges when approaching the effect form Landau Theory. Which is a little bit problematic as the melting of a bulk in general has to be considered as a first order phase transition, meaning the order parameter &lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt; jumps at &lt;math&gt; t= 0 &lt;/math&gt;. The derivation of Lipowski (basic geometry shown in fig.2) leads to the following results when &lt;math&gt; T \leq T_{m} &lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;
\eta_{0} \propto \begin{cases}
  const.                &amp; \text{, }a &lt; \sqrt{a_{m}} \\
  \left|t\right|^{1/4}  &amp; \text{, }a = \sqrt{a_{m}} \\
  \left|t\right|^{1/2}  &amp; \text{, }a &gt; \sqrt{a_{m}}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \eta_{0} &lt;/math&gt; is the order parameter at the border between (2) and (l), &lt;math&gt; 1/a &lt;/math&gt; the so-called extrapolation length and &lt;math&gt; a_{m} &lt;/math&gt; a constant that enters the model and has to be determined using experiment and other models. Hence one can see that the order parameter in the liquid film can undergo a continuous phase transition for large enough extrapolation length. A further result is that &lt;math&gt; d \propto \left| ln \left|t\right| \right|&lt;/math&gt; what corresponds to the result of the thermodynamical model in the case of short range interactions. 
Landau Theory does not consider fluctuations like capillary waves, this could change the results qualitatively.&lt;ref name=Li&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lipowski |first=R. |title=Critical Surface Phenomena at First-Order Bulk Transitions |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=49 |date=1982 |pages=1575 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.1575 |bibcode=1982PhRvL..49.1575L |issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental proof for premelting==
[[Image:Premelting3.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Shadowing and blocking diffraction experiment to show the occurrence of premelting. The incident beam follows a crystal direction, so does the angle under which the detector is. The disorder of the quasi liquid premelt changes the scattering spectrum.]]
There are several techniques to prove the existence of a liquid layer on a well-ordered surface. Basically it is all about showing that there is a phase on top of the solid which has hardly any order (quasi-liquid, see fig. order parameter). One possibility was done by Frenken and van der Veen using proton scattering on a lead (Pb) single crystal (110) surface. First the surface was atomically cleaned in [UHV], because one obviously has to have a very well ordered surface for such experiments. Than they did proton shadowing and blocking measurements. An ideal shadowing and blocking measurements results in an energy spectrum of the scattered protons that shows only a peak for the first surface layer and nothing else. Due to the non ideality of the experiment the spectrum also shows effects of the underlying layers. That means the spectrum is not one well defined peak but has a tail to lower energies due to protons scattered on deeper layers which results in losing energies because of stopping.
This is different for a liquid film on the surface: This film does hardly (to the meaning of hardly see Landau theory) have any order. So the effects of shadowing and blocking vanish what means all the liquid film contributes the same amount of scattered electrons to the signal. Therefore, the peak does not only have a tail, but also becomes broadened.
During their measurements Frenken and van der Veen raised the temperature to the melting point and hence could show that with increasing temperature a disordered film formed on the surface in equilibrium with a still well ordered Pb crystal.

Up to here, an ideal surface was considered, but going beyond the idealized case there are several effects which influence premelting:

*''Curvature'': When the surface considered is not planar but exhibits a curvature premelting is affected. The rule is that whenever the surface is concave, viewed from the solid's perspective, then premelting is advanced. The fraction by which the thickness of the liquid film increases is given by &lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta d}{d}= \frac{2 \gamma_{1-l}}{3 p_{l} q_{m} t r} &lt;/math&gt;, where r is the local radius of the curved surface. Therefore, it is also plausible that premelting starts in scratches or in corners of steps and hence has a flattening effect.
*''Disordered solids'': As disorder in the solid increases its local free energy, the local chemical potential of the disordered solid lies above the chemical potential of the ordered solid. In [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] the chemical potential of the premelted liquid film has to be equal to that of the disordered solid, so it can be concluded that disorder in the solid phase causes the effect of premelting to increase.
*''Impurities'': Consider the case of the depression of the ice melting temperature due to dissolved salt. For premelting the situation is far more difficult than one would expect from that simple statement. It starts with the Lifshitz theory which was roughly sketched above. But now the impurities cause screening in the liquid, they adsorb on the border between solid and liquid phase and all those effects make a general derivation of impurity effects impossible to state here. But it can be said that impurities have a great effect on the temperature from which on premelting can be observed and they especially affect the thickness of the layer. This however does not mean that the thickness is a monotone function in the concentration.&lt;ref name=Da/&gt;

==Ice skating==
The [[friction coefficient]] for ice, without a liquid film on the surface, is measured to be &lt;math&gt; \mu= 0.6 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Bl&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bluhm |first=H. | author2 =  T. Inoue | author3 =  M. Salmeron  |title= Friction of ice measured using lateral force microscopy |journal=Phys. Rev. B |volume=61 |date=2000 |pages=7760 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.61.7760|bibcode = 2000PhRvB..61.7760B |issue=11 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233739/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable friction coefficient is that of rubber or bitumen (roughly 0.8), which would be very difficult to ice skate on. The friction coefficients needs to be around or below 0.005 for ice skating to be possible.&lt;ref name=Ko&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Koning |first=J.J. | author2 =  G. De Groot | author3 =  G.J. Van Ingen Schenau  |title=ICE FRICTION DURING SPEED SKATING |journal=J Biomech |volume=25 |date=1992 |pages=565–71 |doi=10.1016/0021-9290(92)90099-M |pmid=1517252 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason ice skating is possible is because there is a thin film of water  present between the blade of the ice skate and the ice. The origin of this water film has been a long-standing debate.
There are three proposed mechanisms that could account for a film of liquid water on the ice surface:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~jay/846/skating.pdf Why is Ice slippery? Rosenberg. pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pressure Melting: Since water expands upon freezing, ice can be melted by 'crushing' the solid structure with enough pressure. This interpretation was initially proposed by [[John Joly]] in 1886, basing it on an extrapolation from [[Le Chatelier's principle]]. 
* Premelting: Due to premelting effects there is always a thin film of liquid water on the ice surface.
* Friction:  Heat generated from the ice skates moving melts a small amount of ice under the blade.
While contributions from all three of these factors are usually in effect when ice skating, the scientific community has long debated over which is the dominating mechanism. For several decades it was common to explain the low friction of the skates on ice by pressure melting, but there are several recent arguments that contradict this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~jay/846/skating.pdf Why is Ice slippery? Rosenberg. pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest argument against pressure melting is that ice skating is still possible below temperatures under -20&amp;nbsp;°C (253K). At this temperature, a great deal of pressure (&gt;100MPa) is required to induce melting. Just below -23&amp;nbsp;°C (250K), increasing the pressure can only form a different solid structure of ice ([[Ice III]]) since the isotherm no longer passes through the liquid phase on the [[phase diagram]]. While impurities in the ice will suppress the melting temperature, many [[material science| materials scientists]] agree that pressure melting is not the dominate mechanism.&lt;ref name=Co&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colbeck |first=S.C. |title=Pressure melting and ice skating |journal=Am J Phys |volume=63 |date=1995 |pages=888 |doi=10.1119/1.18028|bibcode = 1995AmJPh..63..888C |issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The thickness of the water film due to premelting is also limited at low temperatures.  While the water film can reach thicknesses on the order of &lt;math&gt; \mu m &lt;/math&gt;, at temperatures around -10&amp;nbsp;°C the thickness is on the order of nm.
Although, De Koning et al. found in their measurements that the adding of impurities to the ice can lower the friction coefficient up to 15%. The friction coefficient increases with skating speed, which could yield different results depending on the skating technique and speeds.&lt;ref name=Ko/&gt;
While the pressure melting hypothesis may have been put to rest, the debate between premelting and friction as the dominate mechanism still rages on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2477">A '''protalus rampart''' (or '''pronival rampart''') is a [[depositional landform]] of [[periglaciation|periglacial]] origin. It forms as rock debris falls onto a steep snow slope from a cliff above and slides down the snow surface to come to a rest at the foot of the slope. Over a long period of time, sufficient material can accumulate in this way to produce a distinct bank of stony material which, long after the snowbed has melted away, remains as a rampart (a bank or mound similar to a manmade [[Rampart (fortification)|rampart]]). The debris may also accumulate through [[avalanche|avalanching]] or [[landslide]]. Protalus ramparts may be distinguished from glacial [[moraine]]s by their lack of rock fragments with glacial abrasion or [[glacial striations|striations]]. The morphology of the site may also suggest it being unfavourable for the development of a [[glacier]], but suitable for this mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Shakesby, R. 2002 ''Classic Landforms of the Brecon Beacons'', Geographical Association pp14-15 {{ISBN|1843770164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protalus ramparts are recorded in the [[Cairngorms]] and [[northwest Highlands]] of [[Scotland]]. An especially large example on the north side of [[Baosbheinn]] measures 1&amp;nbsp;km in length and reaches a height of 55&amp;nbsp;m. It is thought to result from a major rock slope failure, however evidence leads some to class it as a protalus [[rock glacier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.landforms.eu/cairngorms/protalus%20rampart.htm|title=Protalus rampart Cairngorm|website=www.landforms.eu|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price, R.J. 1983 ''Scotland's Environment during the last 30,000 years'', Scottish Academic Press, Edinburgh p140 {{ISBN|0707303257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ballantyne, C.K. &amp; Harris, C. 1994 ''The Periglaciation of Great Britain'', Cambridge University Press, pp240-241 {{ISBN|0521310164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several features amongst the mountains of the [[Brecon Beacons National Park]] have been interpreted by some authors as protalus ramparts but as moraines by others. The depositional ridge of Fan Fechan beneath [[Fan Hir]], formerly thought to be a rampart due to its linear nature paralleling the line of the cliff above is now considered to be a moraine.&lt;ref&gt;Shakesby, R. 2002 ''Classic Landforms of the Brecon Beacons'', Geographical Association p24, 27-28, 30-37 {{ISBN|1843770164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Region of the 10 Thousanders''' ({{lang-de|Region der 10 Tausender}}) is a region in the [[Swabian Jura]] in the German state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], the name of which alludes to the high mountain peaks in the area.

Almost all the highest mountains of the Swabian Jura (each over {{Höhe|1000|DE-NHN|link=true}}), including their highest summit ({{Höhe|1015.3|DE}}), are located in this relatively small region which only covers 20&amp;nbsp;km² around [[Deilingen]], [[Wehingen]] and [[Gosheim]] in the southwestern Jura.

The name "Region of the 10 Thousanders" goes back to an action group that was initiated by various restaurants and municipalities of the [[Großer Heuberg|Heuberg]] to promote regional [[tourism]].

The 10 "thousanders" are&amp;nbsp;– sorted by height in [[metre]]s (m) above [[Normalhöhennull|sea level]] (NHN):{{GeoQuelle|DE-BW|LUBW}}

In [[time series]] data, '''seasonality''' is the presence of variations that occur at specific regular intervals less than a year, such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Seasonality may be caused by various factors, such as weather, vacation, and holidays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/barrons_dictionary/dictionary-seasonality-4946957-1.html|}} |title=Influencing Factors|&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of periodic, repetitive, and generally regular and predictable patterns in the levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/seasonality.html|}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a time series.

Seasonal fluctuations in a time series can be contrasted with cyclical patterns. The latter occur when the data exhibits rises and falls that are not of a fixed period. Such non-seasonal fluctuations are usually due to economic conditions and are often related to the "business cycle"; their period usually extends beyond a single year, and the fluctuations are usually of at least two years.&lt;ref name="otexts.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/1|title=6.1 Time series components - OTexts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisations facing seasonal variations, such as ice-cream vendors, are often interested in knowing their performance relative to the normal seasonal variation. Seasonal variations in the labour market can be attributed to the entrance of school leavers into the job market as they aim to contribute to the workforce upon the completion of their schooling. These regular changes are of less interest to those who study employment data than the variations that occur due to the underlying state of the economy; their focus is on how unemployment in the workforce has changed, despite the impact of the regular seasonal variations.&lt;ref name="otexts.org"/&gt;
                                    				
It is necessary for organisations to identify and measure seasonal variations within their market to help them plan for the future. This can prepare them for the temporary increases or decreases in labour requirements and inventory as demand for their product or service fluctuates over certain periods. This may require training, periodic maintenance, and so forth that can be organized in advance. Apart from these considerations, the organisations need to know if variation they have experienced has been more or less than the expected amount, beyond what the usual seasonal variations account for.

==Reasons for studying seasonal variation==

There are several main reasons for studying seasonal variation:

:*The description of the seasonal effect provides a better understanding of the impact this component has upon a particular series.
:*After establishing the seasonal pattern, methods can be implemented to eliminate it from the time-series to study the effect of other components such as [[Frequency|cyclical]] and irregular variations. This elimination of the seasonal effect is referred to as de-seasonalizing or [[seasonal adjustment]] of data.
:*To use the past patterns of the seasonal variations to contribute to forecasting and the prediction of the future trends.

==Detecting seasonality==
The following [[graphical technique]]s can be used to detect seasonality:
* A [[run sequence plot]] will often show seasonality                                                           [[File:SeasonalplotUS.png|thumb|A seasonality plot of US electricity usage]]
* A seasonal plot will show the data from each season overlapped&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/1|title=2.1 Graphics - OTexts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[seasonal subseries plot]] is a specialized technique for showing seasonality
* Multiple [[box plot]]s can be used as an alternative to the seasonal subseries plot to detect seasonality
* An [[autocorrelation plot]] (ACF) and a spectral plot can help identify seasonality.

A really good way to find periodicity, including seasonality, in any regular series of data is to remove any overall trend first and then to inspect time periodicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What method can be used to detect seasonality in data?|url=http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/16117/what-method-can-be-used-to-detect-seasonality-in-data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The run sequence plot is a recommended first step for analyzing any time series. Although seasonality can sometimes be indicated by this plot, seasonality is shown more clearly by the seasonal subseries plot or the box plot. The seasonal subseries plot does an excellent job of showing both the seasonal differences (between group patterns) and also the within-group patterns. The box plot shows the seasonal difference (between group patterns) quite well, but it does not show within group patterns. However, for large data sets, the box plot is usually easier to read than the seasonal subseries plot.

The seasonal plot, seasonal subseries plot, and the box plot all assume that the seasonal periods are known. In most cases, the analyst will in fact, know this. For example, for monthly data, the period is 12 since there are 12 months in a year. However, if the period is not known, the autocorrelation plot can help. If there is significant seasonality, the autocorrelation plot should show spikes at lags equal to the period. For example, for monthly data, if there is a seasonality effect, we would expect to see significant peaks at lag 12, 24, 36, and so on (although the intensity may decrease the further out we go).

An autocorrelation plot (ACF) can be used to identify seasonality, as it calculates the difference (residual amount) between a Y value and a lagged value of Y. The result gives some points where the two values are close together ( no seasonality ), but other points where there is a large discrepancy. These points indicate a level of seasonality in the data.

Semiregular cyclic variations might be dealt with by [[spectral density estimation]].

==Measuring seasonality==

Seasonal variation is measured in terms of an index, called a seasonal index. It is an average that can be used to compare an actual observation relative to what it would be if there were no seasonal variation. An index value is attached to each period of the time series within a year. This implies that if monthly data are considered there are 12 separate seasonal indices, one for each month. The following methods use seasonal indices to measure seasonal variations of a time-series data.

:*Method of simple averages
:*Ratio to [[Trend estimation|trend]] method
:*Ratio-to-[[moving average|moving-average]] method
:*Link relatives method

The measurement of seasonal variation by using the ratio-to-moving-average method provides an index to measure the degree of the seasonal variation in a time series. The index is based on a mean of 100, with the degree of seasonality measured by variations away from the base. For example, if we observe the hotel rentals in a winter resort, we find that the winter quarter index is 124. The value 124 indicates that 124 percent of the average quarterly rental occur in winter. If the hotel management records 1436 rentals for the whole of last year, then the average quarterly rental would be 359= (1436/4). As the winter-quarter index is 124, we estimate the number of winter rentals as follows:

359*(124/100)=445;

Here, 359 is the average quarterly rental. 124 is the winter-quarter index. 445 the seasonalized winter-quarter rental.

This method is also called the percentage [[moving average]] method. In this method, the original data values in the time-series are expressed as percentages of moving averages. The steps and the tabulations are given below.

===Steps===

1. Find the centered 12 monthly (or 4 quarterly) moving averages of the original data values in the [[time-series]].

2. Express each original data value of the time-series as a percentage of the corresponding centered [[moving average]] values obtained in step(1).In other words, in a multiplicative time-series model, we get(Original data values)/(Trend values) *100 = (T*C*S*I)/(T*C)*100 = (S*I) *100.
This implies that the ratio–to-moving average represents the seasonal and irregular components.

3. Arrange these percentages according to months or quarter of given years. Find the averages over all months or quarters of the given years.

4. If the sum of these indices is not 1200(or 400 for quarterly figures), multiply then by a correction factor = 1200/ (sum of monthly indices). Otherwise, the 12 monthly averages will be considered as seasonal indices.

Let us calculate the seasonal index by the ratio-to-moving-average method from the following data:

Now the total of seasonal averages is 398.85. Therefore, the corresponding correction factor would be 400/398.85 = 1.00288. Each seasonal average is multiplied by the correction factor 1.00288 to get the adjusted seasonal indices as shown in the above table.

===Remarks===

1. In an additive time-series model, the seasonal component is estimated as: S = Y − ( T + C + I )

Where S is for Seasonal values

Y is for actual data values of the time-series

T is for [[wikt:trend|trend]] values

C is for cyclical values

I is for irregular values.

2. In a multiplicative time-series model, the seasonal component is expressed in terms of ratio and percentage as

&lt;math&gt; Seasonal\ effect = \frac{T \cdot S \cdot C \cdot I}{ T \cdot C \cdot I} \times 100\ = \frac{Y}{T \cdot C \cdot I} \times 100 &lt;/math&gt;;

However, in practice the detrending of time-series is done to arrive at &lt;math&gt;S \cdot C \cdot I &lt;/math&gt;.

This is done by dividing both sides of &lt;math&gt;Y=T \cdot S \cdot C \cdot I&lt;/math&gt;  by trend values T so that  &lt;math&gt;\frac{Y}{T} =S \cdot C \cdot I&lt;/math&gt;.

3. The deseasonalized time-series data will have only trend (T) cyclical(C) and irregular (I) components and is expressed as:

:*Multiplicative model : &lt;math&gt;\frac{Y}{S} \times 100 = \frac { T \cdot S \cdot C \cdot I}{S} \times 100 = (T \cdot C \cdot I) \times 100 &lt;/math&gt;

:*Additive model: Y – S = ( T + S + C + I ) – S = T + C + I

==Modeling seasonality==
A completely regular cyclic variation in a time series might be dealt with in [[time series analysis]] by using a [[sinusoidal model]] with one or more [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]s whose period-lengths may be known or unknown depending on the context. A less completely regular cyclic variation might be dealt with by using a special form of an [[ARIMA]] model which can be structured so as to treat cyclic variations semi-explicitly. Such models represent [[cyclostationary process]]es.

Another method of modelling periodic seasonality is the use of pairs of Fourier terms. Similar to using the sinusoidal model, Fourier terms added into regression models utilize sine and cosine terms in order to simulate seasonality. However, the seasonality of such a regression would be represented as the sum of sine or cosine terms, instead of a single sine or cosine term in a sinusoidal model. Every periodic function can be approximated with the inclusion of Fourier terms.

The difference between a sinusoidal model and a regression with Fourier terms can be simplified as below:

Sinusoidal Model: 
:&lt;math&gt;Y_i = a + bt + \alpha\sin(2\pi\omega T_i + \phi) + E_i &lt;/math&gt;

Regression With Fourier Terms: 
:&lt;math&gt;Y_i = a + bt + (\sum_{k=1}^K \alpha_k\cdot \sin(\tfrac{2\pi kt}{m}) + \beta_k\cdot \cos(\tfrac{2\pi kt}{n})) + E_i &lt;/math&gt;

==Seasonal adjustment==
{{main article|Seasonal adjustment}}
Seasonal adjustment is any method for removing the seasonal component of a [[time series analysis|time series]]. The resulting seasonally adjusted data are used, for example, when analyzing or reporting non-seasonal trends over durations rather longer than the seasonal period. An appropriate method for seasonal adjustment is chosen on the basis of a particular view taken of the [[decomposition of time series]] into components designated with names such as "trend", "cyclic", "seasonal" and "irregular", including how these interact with each other. For example, such components might act additively or multiplicatively. Thus, if a seasonal component acts additively, the adjustment method has two stages:
*estimate the seasonal component of variation in the time series, usually in a form that has a zero mean across series;
*subtract the estimated seasonal component from the original time series, leaving the seasonally adjusted series: &lt;math&gt; Y_t-S_t=T_t+E_t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="otexts.org"/&gt;

If it is a multiplicative model,the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations will vary with the level, which is more likely to occur with economic series.&lt;ref name="otexts.org"/&gt; When taking seasonality into account, the seasonally adjusted multiplicative decomposition can be written as &lt;math&gt; Y_t/S_t=T_t*E_t&lt;/math&gt;; whereby the original time series is divided by the estimated seasonal component.

The multiplicative model can be transformed into an additive model by taking the log of the time series;

SA Multiplicative decomposition: &lt;math&gt; Y_t=S_t*T_t*E_t &lt;/math&gt;

Taking log of the time series of the multiplicative model: &lt;math&gt; log Y_t=logS_t+logT_t+logE_t &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="otexts.org"/&gt;

One particular implementation of seasonal adjustment is provided by [[X-12-ARIMA]].

==Regression analysis==

In [[regression analysis]] such as [[ordinary least squares]], with a seasonally varying [[dependent variable]] being influenced by one or more [[independent variable]]s, the seasonality can be accounted for and measured by including ''n''-1 [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]s, one for each of the seasons except for an arbitrarily chosen reference season, where ''n'' is the number of seasons (e.g., 4 in the case of meteorological seasons, 12 in the case of months, etc.). Each dummy variable is set to 1 if the data point is drawn from the dummy's specified season and 0 otherwise. Then the predicted value of the dependent variable for the reference season is computed from the rest of the regression, while for any other season it is computed using the rest of the regression and by inserting the value 1 for the dummy variable for that season.

==Difference between seasonal patterns and cyclic patterns==
A '''seasonal pattern''' occurs when a time series is affected by seasonal factors such as the time of the year or the day of the week.
&lt;br /&gt;A '''cycle''' occurs when the data exhibit rises and falls that are not of a fixed period. These fluctuations are usually due to economic conditions and are often related to the "business cycle".
&lt;br /&gt;It is important to distinguish cyclic patterns and seasonal patterns. Seasonal patterns have a fixed and known length, while cyclic patterns have variable and unknown length. The average length of a cycle is usually longer than that of seasonality, and the magnitude of cyclic variation is usually more variable than that of seasonal variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/1|title=2.1 Graphics - OTexts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Secretariat of Energy''' ([[Spanish Language|Spanish:]] ''Secretaría de Energia'') is the [[Ministry (government department)|government department]] in charge of production and regulation of energy in [[Mexico]], this secretary is a member of the [[Mexican Executive Cabinet|Executive Cabinet]].

The current Secretariat of Energy is [[Pedro Joaquín Coldwell]].

==History==
On December 7, 1946, the ''Secretaría de Bienes Nacionales e Inspección Administrativa'' (Secretariat of National Assets and Administrative Inspection) was created with [[Alfonso Caso Andrade]] serving as secretary. In 1958, the name was changed to ''Secretaría de Patrimonio Nacional'' (Secretariat of National Assets, SEPANAL). In the late 1970s and 1980s it changed names two more times, being known as the ''Secretaría de Patrimonio y Fomento Industrial'' (Secretariat of Assets and Industrial Development) during the presidency of [[José López Portillo]] and as the ''Secretaría de Energía, Minas e Industria Paraestatal'' (Secretariat of Energy, Mining and Semi-Public Industries) until obtaining its current name in 1994.

The curve is wiggly because of IR absorption bands in the atmosphere. In the original paper,&lt;ref name=shockley/&gt; the solar spectrum was approximated by a smooth curve, the 6000K [[blackbody spectrum]]. As a result, the efficiency graph was smooth and the values were slightly different.]]

In [[physics]], the '''Shockley–Queisser limit''', also known as the '''detailed balance limit''', '''Shockley Queisser Efficiency Limit''' or '''SQ Limit''', refers to the maximum theoretical [[efficiency of a solar cell]] using a single [[p-n junction]] to collect power from the cell. It was first calculated by [[William Shockley]] and [[Hans-Joachim Queisser]] at [[Shockley Semiconductor]] in 1961, giving a maximum efficiency of 30% at 1.1 eV.&lt;ref name=shockley&gt;{{cite journal|authors=William Shockley and Hans J. Queisser |title=Detailed Balance Limit of Efficiency of p-n Junction Solar Cells |journal=Journal of Applied Physics |volume=32 |date=March 1961 |pages=510-519 |doi=10.1063/1.1736034 |url=http://metronu.ulb.ac.be/npauly/art_2014_2015/shockley_1961.pdf|bibcode=1961JAP....32..510S }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this calculation used a simplified model of the solar spectrum, and more recent calculations give a maximum efficiency of 33.7% at 1.34 eV,&lt;ref name=Ruhle&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tabulated values of the Shockley–Queisser limit for single junction solar cells |author=S. Rühle |journal=[[Solar Energy]] |volume=130 |pages=139–147 |year=2016 |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2016.02.015|bibcode=2016SoEn..130..139R }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the value is still referred to as the Shockley-Queisser limit in their honor. The limit is one of the most fundamental to solar energy production with [[photovoltaic cell]]s, and is considered to be one of the most important contributions in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.computerhistory.org/events/bio/Hans,Queisser |title= Hans Queisser |publisher= Computer History Museum |accessdate = January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limit is that the maximum [[solar conversion efficiency]] is around 33.7% for a single p-n junction photovoltaic cell, assuming typical sunlight conditions ([[Concentrator photovoltaics|unconcentrated]], [[Air mass (solar energy)|AM 1.5 solar spectrum]]), and subject to other caveats and assumptions discussed below. This maximum occurs at a [[band gap]] of 1.34 [[electron-volt|eV]].&lt;ref name=Ruhle&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tabulated values of the Shockley–Queisser limit for single junction solar cells |author=S. Rühle |journal=[[Solar Energy]] |volume=130 |pages=139–147 |year=2016 |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2016.02.015|bibcode=2016SoEn..130..139R }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, of all the power contained in sunlight (about 1000 W/m²) falling on an ideal solar cell, only 33.7% of that could ever be turned into electricity (337 W/m²). The most popular solar cell material, silicon, has a less favorable band gap of 1.1 eV, resulting in a maximum efficiency of about 32%. Modern commercial mono-crystalline solar cells produce about 24% conversion efficiency, the losses due largely to practical concerns like reflection off the front of the cell and light blockage from the thin wires on the cell surface.

The Shockley–Queisser limit only applies to conventional solar cells with a single p-n junction; [[tandem solar cell]]s with multiple layers can (and do) outperform this limit, and so can [[solar thermal]] and certain other solar energy systems. In the extreme limit, for a tandem solar cell with an infinite number of layers, the corresponding limit is 86.8% using concentrated sunlight.&lt;ref name=Vos80&gt;A. De Vos, "Detailed balance limit of the efficiency of tandem solar cells", ''Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics'' Volume 13, Issue 5 (14 May 1980), page 839-846 {{doi|10.1088/0022-3727/13/5/018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Solar cell efficiency]].)

==Background==
[[File:ShockleyQueisserZoomedIn.svg|thumb|The Shockley–Queisser limit, zoomed in near the region of peak efficiency.]]
In a traditional [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[semiconductor]] such as [[silicon]], a solar cell is made from two doped crystals, one an [[n-type semiconductor]], which has extra free [[electron]]s, and the other a [[p-type semiconductor]], which is lacking free electrons, referred to as "holes." When initially placed in contact with each other, some of the electrons in the n-type portion will flow into the p-type to "fill in" the missing electrons. Eventually enough will flow across the boundary to equalize the [[Fermi level]]s of the two materials. The result is a region at the interface, the [[p-n junction]], where charge carriers are depleted on each side of the interface. In silicon, this transfer of electrons produces a [[potential barrier]] of about 0.6 [[volt|V]] to 0.7 V.&lt;ref name=how&gt;{{cite web | title = Photovoltaic Cells (Solar Cells), How They Work | publisher = specmat.com | url = http://www.specmat.com/Overview%20of%20Solar%20Cells.htm | accessdate = 2 May 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070518221308/http://www.specmat.com/Overview%20of%20Solar%20Cells.htm |archivedate = 18 May 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the material is placed in the sun, [[photon]]s from the sunlight can be absorbed in the p-type side of the semiconductor, causing electrons in the [[valence band]] to be promoted in energy to the [[conduction band]]. This process is known as [[photoexcitation]]. As the name implies, electrons in the conduction band are free to move about the semiconductor. When a load is placed across the cell as a whole, these electrons will flow from the p-type side into the n-type side, lose energy while moving through the external circuit, and then go back into the p-type material where they can re-combine with the valence-band holes they left behind. In this way, sunlight creates an electric current.&lt;ref name=how/&gt;

==The limit==
The Shockley–Queisser limit is calculated by examining the amount of electrical energy that is extracted per photon of incoming sunlight. There are several considerations:

===Blackbody radiation===
Any material, that is not at absolute zero (0 Kelvin), emits electromagnetic radiation through the [[black-body radiation]] effect. In a cell at [[room temperature]], this represents approximately 7% of all the energy falling on the cell.

Any energy lost in a cell is turned into heat, so any inefficiency in the cell increases the cell temperature when it is placed in sunlight. As the temperature of the cell increases, the outgoing radiation and heat loss through conduction and convection also increase, until an equilibrium is reached. In practice, this equilibrium is normally reached at temperatures as high as 360 Kelvin, and consequently, cells normally operate at lower efficiencies than their room-temperature rating. Module datasheets normally list this temperature dependency as {{mvar|T&lt;sub&gt;NOCT&lt;/sub&gt;}} (NOCT - Nominal Operating Cell Temperature).

For a "blackbody" at normal temperatures, a very small part of this radiation (the number per unit time and per unit area given by {{mvar|Q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}, "c" for "cell") is photons having energy greater than the band gap (wavelength less than about 1.1&amp;nbsp;microns for silicon), and part of these photons (Shockley and Queisser use the factor ''t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'') are generated by recombination of electrons and holes, which decreases the amount of current that could be generated otherwise. This is a very small effect, but Shockley and Queisser assume that the total rate of recombination (see below) when the voltage across the cell is zero (short circuit or no light) is proportional to the blackbody radiation {{mvar|Q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This rate of recombination plays a negative role in the efficiency. Shockley and Queisser calculate {{mvar|Q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be 1700 photons per second per square centimetre for silicon at 300K.

===Recombination===
[[File:ShockleyQueisserVOC.svg|thumb|Black curve: The limit for [[open-circuit voltage]] in the Shockley–Queisser model (i.e., voltage at zero current). The red dotted line shows that this voltage is always below the bandgap. This voltage is limited by recombination.]]
Absorption of a photon creates an electron-hole pair, which could potentially contribute to the current. However, the reverse process must also be possible, according to the principle of [[detailed balance]]: an electron and a hole can meet and recombine, emitting a photon. This process reduces the efficiency of the cell. Other recombination processes may also exist (see "Other considerations" below), but this one is absolutely required.

In the Shockley–Queisser model, the recombination rate depends on the voltage across the cell but is the same whether or not there is light falling on the cell. A factor ''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' gives the ratio of recombination that produces radiation to total recombination, so the rate of recombination per unit area when ''V''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is ''2t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''/''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' and thus depends on ''Q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', the flux of blackbody photons above the band-gap energy. The factor of 2 was included on the assumption that radiation emitted by the cell goes in both directions. (This is actually debatable if a reflective surface is used on the shady side.) When the voltage is non-zero, the concentrations of charge carriers (electrons and holes) change (see [[Shockley diode equation]]), and according to the authors the rate of recombination changes by a factor of exp(''V''/''V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''), where ''V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the voltage equivalent of the temperature of the cell, or "[[thermal voltage]]", namely

:&lt;math&gt;V_c=kT_c/q&lt;/math&gt;

(''q'' being the charge of an electron). Thus the rate of recombination, in this model, is proportional to exp(''V''/''V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'') times the blackbody radiation above the band-gap energy:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\nu_g}^\infty\frac 1{\exp\left(\frac{h\nu}{kT_c}\right)-1}e^\frac{qV}{kT_c}\frac{2\pi\nu^2}{c^2}d\nu&lt;/math&gt;

(This is actually an approximation to the more accurate expression&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Thermodynamic Limit of Photovoltaic Energy Conversion|author1=A. De Vos  |author2=H.

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\nu_g}^\infty\frac 1{\exp\left(\frac{h\nu-qV}{kT_c}\right)-1}\frac{2\pi\nu^2}{c^2}d\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

which is correct so long as the cell is thick enough to act as a black body. The difference in maximum theoretical efficiency however is negligibly small, except for tiny bandgaps below 200meV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Shockley-Queisser limit |url=http://sjbyrnes.com/sq.html |access-date=2016-03-10 |last=Byrnes |first=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The rate of ''generation'' of electron-hole pairs ''not'' due to incoming sunlight stays the same, so recombination minus spontaneous generation is

&lt;math&gt;I_0[\exp(V/V_c)-1].&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_0=2qt_cQ_c/f_c.&lt;/math&gt;

(Shockley and Queisser take ''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' to be a constant, although they admit that it may itself depend on voltage.)

The rate of generation of electron-hole pairs due to sunlight is

:&lt;math&gt;I_{sh}=q(t_sf_\omega Q_s-2t_cQ_c)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_\omega Q_s&lt;/math&gt; is the number of photons above the band-gap energy falling on the cell per unit area, and ''t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the fraction of these that generate an electron-hole pair. This rate of generation is called ''I&lt;sub&gt;sh&lt;/sub&gt;'' because it is the "short circuit" current (per unit area). When there is a load, then ''V'' will not be zero and we have a current equal to the rate of generation of pairs due to the sunlight minus the difference between recombination and spontaneous generation:

:&lt;math&gt;I=I_{sh}-I_0[\exp(V/V_c)-1].&lt;/math&gt;

The open-circuit voltage is therefore given (assuming ''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' does not depend on voltage) by

:&lt;math&gt;V_{oc}=V_c\ln\left(\frac{I_{sh}}{I_0}+1\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The product of the short-circuit current ''I&lt;sub&gt;sh&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the open-circuit voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;'' Shockley and Queisser call the "nominal power". It is not actually possible to get this amount of power out of the cell, but we can get close (see "Impedance matching" below).

The ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the band-gap voltage Shockley and Queisser call ''V''. Under open-circuit conditions, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ln I_{sh}=\ln I_0+\ln[\exp(V/V_c)-1].&lt;/math&gt;

[[Asymptotic]]ally, this gives

:&lt;math&gt;-V_g/V_s\sim-V_g/V_c+V/V_c&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;V/V_g\sim1-V_c/V_s&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the voltage equivalent of the temperature of the sun. As the ratio {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''/''V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}} goes to zero, the open-circuit voltage goes to the band-gap voltage, and as it goes to one, the open-circuit voltage goes to zero. This is why the efficiency falls if the cell heats up. In fact this expression represents the thermodynamic upper limit of the amount of work that can be obtained from a heat source at the temperature of the sun and a heat sink at the temperature of the cell.

===Spectrum losses===
Since the act of moving an electron from the valence band to the conduction band requires energy, only photons with more than that amount of energy will produce an electron-hole pair. In silicon the conduction band is about 1.1 eV away from the valence band, this corresponds to infrared light with a wavelength of about 1.1&amp;nbsp;microns. In other words, photons of red, yellow and blue light and some near-infrared will contribute to power production, whereas radio waves, microwaves, and most infrared photons will not.&lt;ref name=advanced&gt;C. S. Solanki and G. Beaucarne, [http://www.ese.iitb.ac.in/aer2006_files/papers/086.pdf "Advanced Solar Cell Concepts"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Interuniversity Microelectronics Center, Belgium&lt;/ref&gt; This places an immediate limit on the amount of energy that can be extracted from the sun. Of the 1,000 W/m² in AM1.5 sunlight, about 19% of that has less than 1.1 eV of energy, and will not produce power in a silicon cell.

Another important contributor to losses is that any energy above and beyond the [[bandgap]] energy is lost. While blue light has roughly twice the energy of red light, that energy is not captured by devices with a single p-n junction. The electron is ejected with higher energy when struck by a blue photon, but it loses this extra energy as it travels toward the p-n junction (the energy is converted into heat).&lt;ref name=advanced/&gt; This accounts for about 33% of the incident sunlight, meaning that, for silicon, from spectrum losses alone there is a theoretical conversion efficiency limit of about 48%, ignoring all other factors.

There is a trade-off in the selection of a bandgap. If the band gap is large, not as many photons create pairs, whereas if the band gap is small, the electron-hole pairs do not contain as much energy.

Shockley and Queisser call the efficiency factor associated with spectrum losses {{mvar|u}}, for "ultimate efficiency function". Shockley and Queisser calculated that the best band gap for sunlight happens to be 1.1 eV, the value for silicon, and gives a {{mvar|u}} of 44%. They used blackbody radiation of 6000K for sunlight, and found that the optimum band gap would then have an energy of 2.2&amp;nbsp;''kT&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''. (At that value, 22% of the blackbody radiation energy would be below the band gap.) Using a more accurate spectrum may give a slightly different optimum. A blackbody at 6000&amp;nbsp;K puts out 7348&amp;nbsp;W per square centimetre, so a value for {{mvar|u}} of 44% and a value of {{val|5.73|e=18}} photons per joule (corresponding to a band gap of 1.09&amp;nbsp;V, the value used by Shockley and Queisser) gives {{mvar|Q&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} equal to {{val|1.85|e=22}} photons per second per square centimetre.

===Impedance matching===
If the resistance of the load is too high, the current will be very low, while if the load resistance is too low, the voltage drop across it will be very low. There is an optimal load resistance that will draw the most power from the solar cell at a given illumination level. Shockley and Queisser call the ratio of power extracted to {{math|''I&lt;sub&gt;sh&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;''}} the impedance matching factor, {{mvar|m}}. (It is also call the [[Solar cell efficiency#Fill factor|fill factor]].) The optimum depends on the shape of the {{mvar|I}} versus {{mvar|V}} curve. For very low illumination, the curve is more or less a diagonal line, and {{mvar|m}} will be 1/4. But for high illumination, {{mvar|m}} approaches 1. Shockley and Queisser give a graph showing {{mvar|m}} as a function of the ratio {{mvar|z&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the open-circuit voltage to the thermal voltage {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}. According to the authors, this ratio is well approximated by {{math|ln(''fQ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/''Q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, where {{mvar|f}} is the combination of factors {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/(2''t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, in which {{mvar|f&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the solid angle of the sun divided by π. The maximum value of {{mvar|f}} without light concentration (with reflectors for example) is just {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;/2}}, or {{val|1.09|e=-5}}, according to the authors. Using the above mentioned values of {{mvar|Q&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|Q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}, this gives a ratio of open-circuit voltage to thermal voltage of 32.4 ({{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;}} equal to 77% of the band gap). The authors derive the equation

:&lt;math&gt;z_{oc}=z_m+\ln(1+z_m)&lt;/math&gt;

which can be solved to find {{mvar|z&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the ratio of optimal voltage to thermal voltage. For a {{mvar|z&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;}} of 32.4, we find {{mvar|z&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} equal to 29.0. One can then use the formula

:&lt;math&gt;m=\frac{z_m^2/z_{oc}}{1+z_m-\exp(-z_m)}&lt;/math&gt;

to find the impedance matching factor. For a {{mvar|z&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;}} of 32.4, this comes to 86.5%.

===All together===
Considering the spectrum losses alone, a solar cell has a peak theoretical efficiency of 48% (or 44% according to Shockley and Queisser – their "ultimate efficiency factor"). Thus the spectrum losses represent the vast majority of lost power. Including the effects of recombination and the ''I'' versus ''V'' curve, the efficiency is described by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta=t_su(x_g)v(f,x_c,x_g)m(vx_g/x_c)&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;x_g=V_g/V_s&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_c=V_c/V_s&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|u}}, {{mvar|v}}, and {{mvar|m}} are respectively the ultimate efficiency factor, the ratio of open-circuit voltage to band-gap voltage, and the impedance matching factor (all discussed above). Letting {{mvar|t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} be 1, and using the values mentioned above of 44%, 77%, and 86.5% for the three factors gives about 29% overall efficiency. Shockley and Queisser say 30% in their abstract, but do not give a detailed calculation. A more recent reference gives, for a single-junction cell, a theoretical peak performance of about 33.7%, or about 337 W/m² in AM1.5.&lt;ref name=shockley/&gt;&lt;ref name=advanced/&gt;

When the amount of sunlight is increased using reflectors or lenses, the factor {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;}} (and therefore {{mvar|f}}) will be higher. This raises both {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|m}}. Shockley and Queisser include a graph showing the overall efficiency as a function of band gap for various values of {{mvar|f}}. For a value of 1, the graph shows a maximum efficiency of just over 40%, getting close to the ultimate efficiency (by their calculation) of 44%.

===Other considerations===
Shockley and Queisser's work considered the most basic physics only; there are a number of other factors that further reduce the theoretical power.

====Limited mobility====
When an electron is ejected through photoexcitation, the atom it was formerly bound to is left with a net positive charge. Under normal conditions, the atom will pull off an electron from a surrounding atom in order to neutralize itself. That atom will then attempt to remove an electron from another atom, and so forth, producing an ionization chain reaction that moves through the cell. Since these can be viewed as the motion of a positive charge, it is useful to refer to them as "holes", a sort of virtual positive electron.

Like electrons, holes move around the material, and will be attracted towards a source of electrons. Normally these are provided through an electrode on the back surface of the cell. Meanwhile, the conduction-band electrons are moving forward towards the electrodes on the front surface. For a variety of reasons, holes in silicon move much more slowly than electrons. This means that during the finite time while the electron is moving forward towards the p-n junction, it may meet a slowly moving hole left behind by a previous photoexcitation. When this occurs, the electron recombines at that atom, and the energy is lost (normally through the emission of a photon of that energy, but there are a variety of possible processes).

Recombination places an upper limit on the ''rate'' of production; past a certain rate there are so many holes in motion that new electrons will never make it to the p-n junction. In silicon this reduces the theoretical performance under normal operating conditions by another 10% over and above the thermal losses noted above. Materials with higher electron (or hole) mobility can improve on silicon's performance; [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) cells gain about 5% in real-world examples due to this effect alone. In brighter light, when it is concentrated by mirrors or lenses for example, this effect is magnified. Normal silicon cells quickly saturate, while GaAs continue to improve at concentrations as high as 1500 times.

====Non-radiative recombination====

Recombination between electrons and holes is detrimental in a solar cell, so designers try to minimize it. However, radiative recombination—when an electron and hole recombine to create a photon that exits the cell into the air—is inevitable, because it is the time-reversed process of light absorption. Therefore, the Shockley–Queisser calculation takes radiative recombination into account; but it assumes (optimistically) that there is no other source of recombination. More realistic limits, which are lower than the Shockley–Queisser limit, can be calculated by taking into account other causes of recombination. These include recombination at defects and grain boundaries.

In crystalline silicon, even if there are no crystalline defects, there is still [[Auger recombination]], which occurs much more often than radiative recombination. By taking this into account, the theoretical efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells was calculated to be 29.4%.&lt;ref name="Richter2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=A. Richter |author2=M. Hermle |author3=S.W.

==Exceeding the limit==
[[File:ShockleyQueisserBreakdown2.svg|thumb|Breakdown of the causes for the Shockley–Queisser limit. The black height is energy that can be extracted as useful electrical power (the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit); the pink height is energy of below-bandgap photons; the green height is energy lost when hot photogenerated electrons and holes relax to the band edges; the blue height is energy lost in the tradeoff between low radiative recombination versus high operating voltage. Designs that exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit work by overcoming one or more of these three loss processes.]]
It is important to note that the analysis of Shockley and Queisser was based on the following assumptions:
# One electron–hole pair excited per incoming photon
# Thermal relaxation of the electron–hole pair energy in excess of the band gap
# Illumination with non-concentrated sunlight

None of these assumptions is necessarily true, and a number of different approaches have been used to significantly surpass the basic limit.

===Tandem cells===
{{main|Multijunction photovoltaic cell}}
The most widely explored path to higher efficiency solar cells has been [[multijunction photovoltaic cell]]s, also known as "tandem cells". These cells use multiple p-n junctions, each one tuned to a particular frequency of the [[spectrum]]. This reduces the problem discussed above, that a material with a single given bandgap cannot absorb sunlight below the bandgap, and cannot take full advantage of sunlight far above the bandgap. In the most common design, a high-bandgap solar cell sits on top, absorbing high-energy, low-wavelength light, and transmitting the rest. Beneath it is a lower-bandgap solar cell which absorbs some of the lower-energy, longer-wavelength light. There may be yet another cell beneath that one, with as many as four layers in total.

The calculation of the fundamental efficiency limits of these multijunction cells works in a fashion similar to those for single-junction cells, with the caveat that some of the light will be converted to other frequencies and re-emitted within the structure. Using methods similar to the original Shockley–Queisser analysis with these considerations in mind produces similar results; a two-layer cell can reach 42% efficiency, three-layer cells 49%, and a theoretical infinity-layer cell 68% in non-concentrated sunlight.&lt;ref name=Vos80/&gt;

The majority of tandem cells that have been produced to date use three layers, tuned to blue (on top), yellow (middle) and red (bottom). These cells require the use of semiconductors that can be tuned to specific frequencies, which has led to most of them being made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) compounds, often germanium for red, GaAs for yellow, and GaInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for blue. They are very expensive to produce, using techniques similar to [[microprocessor]] construction but with "chip" sizes on the scale of several centimeters. In cases where outright performance is the only consideration, these cells have become common; they are widely used in [[satellite]] applications for instance, where the [[power-to-weight ratio]] overwhelms practically every other consideration. They also can be used in [[concentrated photovoltaic]] applications (see below), where a relatively small solar cell can serve a large area.

Tandem cells are not restricted to high-performance applications; they are also used to make moderate-efficiency photovoltaics out of cheap but low-efficiency materials. One example is [[Silicon thin-film cell|amorphous silicon solar cell]]s, where triple-junction tandem cells are commercially available from [[Uni-Solar]] and other companies.

===Light concentration===
{{main|Concentrated photovoltaics}}
Sunlight can be concentrated with lenses or mirrors to much higher intensity. The sunlight intensity is a parameter in the Shockley–Queisser calculation, and with more concentration, the theoretical efficiency limit increases somewhat. If, however, the intense light heats up the cell, which often occurs in practice, the theoretical efficiency limit may go down all things considered.

In practice, the choice of whether or not to use light concentration is based primarily on other factors besides the small change in solar cell efficiency. These factors include the relative cost per area of solar cells versus focusing optics like lenses or mirrors, the cost of sunlight-tracking systems, the proportion of light successfully focused onto the solar cell, and so on.

A wide variety of optical systems can be used to concentrate sunlight, including ordinary lenses and curved mirrors, [[fresnel lens]]es, arrays of small flat mirrors, and [[luminescent solar concentrator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Thomson, [http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/solarcells-0710.html "MIT opens new 'window' on solar energy"], ''MIT News'', 10 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kittidachachan|first1=Pattareeya|last2=Danos|first2=Lefteris|last3=Meyer|first3=Thomas J.

{{main|Intermediate band photovoltaics}}
There has been some work on producing mid-energy states within single crystal structures. These cells would combine some of the advantages of the multi-junction cell with the simplicity of existing silicon designs. A detailed limit calculation for these cells with infinite bands suggests a maximum efficiency of 77.2%&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Brown and Martin A. Green, [http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jap/92/3/10.1063/1.1492016 "Impurity photovoltaic effect: Fundamental energy conversion efficiency limits"], ''Journal of Applied Physics'', Volume 92, Issue 1 August 2002, pg. 1392, {{doi|10.1063/1.1492016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, no commercial cell using this technique has been produced.

===Photon upconversion===
{{main|Photon upconversion}}
As discussed above, photons with energy below the bandgap are wasted in ordinary single-junction solar cells. One way to reduce this waste is to use [[photon upconversion]], i.e. incorporating into the module a molecule or material that can absorb two or more below-bandgap photons and then emit one above-bandgap photon. Another possibility is to use [[two-photon absorption]], but this can only work at extremely high light concentration.&lt;ref&gt;Bahram Jalali, Sasan Fathpour, and Kevin Tsia, [http://www.osa-opn.org/Archives/0609/Features/feature1.aspx "Green Silicon Photonics"], ''Optics and Photonics News'', Vol. 20, Issue 6, pp. 18-23 (2009), {{doi|10.1364/OPN.20.6.000018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal photon upconversion===
Thermal upconversion is based on the absorption of photons with low energies in the upconverter, which heats up and re-emits photons with higher energies.&lt;ref&gt;N.J. Ekins-Daukes et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 82, 1974 (2003) {{doi|10.1063/1.1561159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upconversion efficiency can be improved by controlling the optical density of states of the absorber&lt;ref&gt;D.J Farrell et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 99, 111102 (2011) {{doi|10.1063/1.3636401}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by tuning the angularly-selective emission characteristics. For example, a planar thermal upconverting platform can have a front surface that absorbs low-energy photons incident within a narrow angular range, and a back surface that efficiently emits only high-energy photons.&lt;ref&gt;S.V. Boriskina, G. Chen, 2014, 314, 71–78, {{doi|10.1016/j.optcom.2013.10.042}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hybrid thermophotovoltaic platform exploiting thermal upconversion was theoretically predicted to demonstrate maximum conversion efficiency of 73% under illumination by non-concentrated sunlight. A detailed analysis of non-ideal hybrid platforms that allows for up to 15% of absorption/re-emission losses yielded limiting efficiency value of 45% for Si PV cells.

===Hot electron capture===
One of the main loss mechanisms is due to the loss of excess carrier energy above the bandgap. It should be no surprise that there has been a considerable amount of research into ways to capture the energy of the carriers before they can lose it in the crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Conibeer et all, [http://gcep.stanford.edu/research/factsheets/hotcarriersolarcell.html "Hot Carrier Solar Cell: Implementation of the Ultimate Photovoltaic Converter"], Global Climate &amp; Energy Project, Stanford University, September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One system under investigation for this is [[quantum dot]]s.&lt;ref name=Nozik&gt;A. J. Nozik, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy02osti/31011.pdf "Quantum Dot Solar Cells"], National Renewable Energy Laboratory, October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple exciton generation===
{{main|Multiple exciton generation}}
A related concept is to use semiconductors that generate more than one excited electron per absorbed photon, instead of a single electron at the band edge. [[Quantum dot]]s have been extensively investigated for this effect, and they have been shown to work for solar-relevant wavelengths in prototype solar cells.&lt;ref name=Nozik/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. E. Semonin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6062/1530.fulll "Peak External Photocurrent Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 100% via MEG in a Quantum Dot Solar Cell"], ''Science'', 2011 vol. 334 (6062) pp. 1530-1533&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, more straightforward way to utilise multiple exciton generation is a process called [[singlet fission]] (or singlet exciton fission) by which a [[singlet state|singlet]] exciton is converted into two [[Spin triplet|triplet]] excitons of lower energy. This allows for higher theoretical efficiencies when coupled to a low bandgap semiconductor&lt;ref&gt;B. Ehrler, [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl204297u "Singlet Exciton Fission-Sensitized Infrared Quantum Dot Solar Cells"], ''Nano Letters'', 2012 vol. 12 (2) pp. 1053-1057&lt;/ref&gt; and [[quantum efficiency|quantum efficiencies]] exceeding 100% have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;D. N. Congreve, [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6130/334 "External Quantum Efficiency Above 100% in a Singlet-Exciton-Fission–Based Organic Photovoltaic Cell"], ''Science'', 2013 vol. 340 (6130) pp. 334-337&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in materials where the (excited) electrons interact strongly with the remaining electrons such as [[Mott insulators]] multiple excitons can be generated.&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;{{cite journal |title=Role of impact ionization in the thermalization of photoexcited Mott insulators |author1=P. Werner |author2=K. Held |author3=M. Eckstein  |last-author-amp=yes |journal=[[Phys. Rev. B]] |volume=90 |pages=235102 |year=2014 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.90.235102|arxiv = 1408.3425| bibcode =  2014PhRvB..90w5102W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluorescent downconversion/downshifting===
Another possibility for increased efficiency is to convert the frequency of light down towards the [[bandgap]] energy with a [[fluorescent]] material. In particular, to exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit, it is necessary for the fluorescent material to convert a single high-energy photon into several lower-energy ones ([[quantum efficiency]] &gt; 1). For example, one photon with more than double the bandgap energy can become two photons above the bandgap energy. In practice, however, this conversion process tends to be relatively inefficient. If a very efficient system were found, such a material could be painted on the front surface of an otherwise standard cell, boosting its efficiency for little cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarindustrymag.com/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2166 "Sunovia, EPIR Demonstrate Optical Down-Conversion For Solar Cells"]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, considerable progress has been made in the exploration of fluorescent downshifting, which converts high-energy light (e. g., UV light) to low-energy light (e. g., red light) with a quantum efficiency smaller than 1. The cell may be more sensitive to these lower-energy photons. Dyes, rare-earth phosphors and quantum dots are actively investigated for fluorescent downshifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klampaftis|first1=Efthymios|last2=Ross|first2=David|last3=McIntosh|first3=Keith R.|last4=Richards|first4=Bryce S.|title=Enhancing the performance of solar cells via luminescent down-shifting of the incident spectrum: A review|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=August 2009|volume=93|issue=8|pages=1182–1194|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2009.02.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, silicon quantum dots enabled downshifting has led to the efficiency enhancement of the state-of-the-art silicon solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pi|first1=Xiaodong|last2=Zhang|first2=Li|last3=Yang|first3=Deren|title=Enhancing the Efficiency of Multicrystalline Silicon Solar Cells by the Inkjet Printing of Silicon-Quantum-Dot Ink|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry C|date=11 October 2012|volume=116|issue=40|pages=21240–21243|doi=10.1021/jp307078g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermophotovoltaic downconversion===
{{main|Thermophotovoltaic}}
Thermophotovoltaic cells are similar to phosphorescent systems, but use a plate to act as the downconvertor. Solar energy falling on the plate, typically black-painted metal, is re-emitted as lower-energy IR, which can then be captured in an IR cell. This relies on a practical IR cell being available, but the theoretical conversion efficiency can be calculated. For a converter with a bandgap of 0.92 eV, efficiency is limited to 54% with a single-junction cell, and 85% for concentrated light shining on ideal components with no optical losses and only radiative recombination.&lt;ref&gt;Nils-Peter Harder and Peter Würfel, [http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0268-1242/18/5/303 "Theoretical limits of thermophotovoltaic solar energy conversion"], ''Semiconductor Science and Technology'', Volume 18 Issue 5 (May 2003), S151-S157, {{doi|10.1088/0268-1242/18/5/303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12656">A '''solvated electron''' is a [[particle|free]] [[electron]] in (solvated in) a [[solution]], and is the smallest possible [[anion]]. Solvated electrons occur widely, although it is difficult to observe them directly since their lifetimes are so short.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/anie.196801901|title=Formation and Properties of Solvated Electrons|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English|volume=7|issue=3|pages=190–203|year=1968|last1=Schindewolf|first1=U.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deep color of solutions of alkali metals in [[ammonia]] arises from the presence of solvated electrons: blue when dilute and copper-colored when more concentrated (&gt; 3 molar).&lt;ref name="c&amp;w"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotton  |first=F.A |authorlink= |author2=G. Wilkinson  |title=Advanced Inorganic Chemistry |year=1972 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons Inc |location= |isbn=978-0-471-17560-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classically, discussions of solvated electrons focus on their solutions in ammonia, which are stable for days, but solvated electrons also occur in water and other solvents -- in fact, in any solvent that mediates [[outer-sphere electron transfer]]. The real hydration energy of the solvated electron can be estimated by using the hydration energy of proton in water combined with kinetic data from pulse radiolysis experiments. The solvated electron forms an acid-base pair with [[atomic hydrogen]].

The solvated electron is responsible for a great deal of [[radiation chemistry]].

Alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia giving deep blue solutions which are conducting in nature. The blue colour of the solution is due to ammoniated electrons which absorb energy in the visible region of light. Alkali metals also dissolve in [[hexamethylphosphoramide]], forming blue solutions.

== Properties ==
Focusing on ammonia solutions, all of the alkali metals, as well as [[calcium|Ca]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Calcium–Ammonia|author=Edwin M. Kaiser|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis|year=2001|doi=10.1002/047084289X.rc003|chapter=Calcium-Ammonia|isbn=978-0471936237}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[strontium|Sr]], [[barium|Ba]], [[europium|Eu]], and [[ytterbium|Yb]] (also [[magnesium|Mg]] using an electrolytic process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-0728(00)00504-0|title=Solutions of solvated electrons in liquid ammonia|journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry|volume=499|pages=144–151|year=2001|last1=Combellas|first1=C|last2=Kanoufi|first2=F|last3=Thiébault|first3=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;), dissolve to give the characteristic blue solutions. Other amines, such as [[methylamine]] and [[ethylamine]], are also suitable solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lithium ammonia solution at −60&amp;nbsp;°C is saturated at about 15&amp;nbsp;mol% metal (MPM). When the concentration is increased in this range [[electrical conductivity]] increases from 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[ohm]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[[Centimetre|cm]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (larger than liquid [[mercury (element)|mercury]]). At around 8&amp;nbsp;MPM, a "transition to the metallic state" (TMS) takes place (also called a "metal to nonmetal transition" (MNMT)). At 4&amp;nbsp;MPM a liquid-liquid phase separation takes place: the less dense gold-color phase becomes immiscible from a more dense blue phase. Above 8 MPM the solution is bronze/gold-colored. In the same concentration range the overall [[density]] decreases by 30%.

Dilute solutions are [[paramagnetic]] and at around 0.5&amp;nbsp;MPM all electrons are [[Electron pair|paired up]] and the solution becomes [[diamagnetic]]. Several models exist to describe the spin-paired species: as an ion trimer; as an ion-triple—a cluster of two single-electron solvated-electron species in association with a cation; or as a cluster of two solvated electrons and two solvated cations.

Solvated electrons produced by dissolution of reducing metals in ammonia and amines are the anions of salts called [[electride]]s. Such salts can be isolated by the addition of [[macrocyclic]] [[ligand]]s such as [[crown ether]] and [[cryptand]]s.  These ligands bind strongly the cations and prevent their re-reduction by the electron.

Its [[standard electrode potential]] value is -2.77 V.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3583572?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Baxendale, J. H. (1964) , Radiation Res. Suppl., 114 and 139]&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalent conductivity 177 Mho cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is similar to that of [[hydroxide ion]]. This value of equivalent conductivity corresponds to a diffusivity of 4,75*10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Survey of Progress in Chemistry p 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Some thermodynamic properties of the solvated electron have been investigated by Jortner and Noyes (1966)&lt;ref&gt;J. Phys. Chem., 1966, 70 (3), pp 770–774
doi: 10.1021/j100875a026 [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j100875a026]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkaline aqueous solutions above pH = 9.6 regenerate the hydrated electron through the reaction of hydrated atomic hydrogen with [[hydroxide]] ion giving water beside hydrated electrons.

Below pH = 9.6 the hydrated electron reacts with [[hydronium ion]] giving atomic hydrogen, which in turn can react with the hydrated electron giving hydroxide ion and usual molecular hydrogen H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The properties of solvated electron can be investigated using the [[rotating ring-disk electrode]].

== Reactivity and applications ==
The solvated electron reacts with [[oxygen]] to form a [[superoxide]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.−&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hayyan, M.; Hashim M.

Chem.|year=1982|volume=86|issue=11|pages=2078–84|doi=10.1021/j100208a035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The solvated electrons can be scavenged from both aqueous and organic systems with [[nitrobenzene]] or [[sulfur hexafluoride]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

A common use of sodium dissolved in liquid ammonia is the [[Birch reduction]].  Other reactions where sodium is used as a reducing agent also are assumed to involve solvated electrons, e.g. the use of sodium in ethanol as in the [[Bouveault–Blanc reduction]].

== Diffusion ==
The diffusivity of the solvated electron in liquid ammonia can be determined using potential-step [[chronoamperometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271082773 | title=The diffusion coefficient of solvated electrons in liquid ammonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first recorded observation of the color of metal-electride solutions is generally attributed to [[Sir Humphry Davy]]. In 1807–1809, he examined the addition of grains of potassium to gaseous ammonia (liquefaction of ammonia was invented in 1823). [[James Ballantyne Hannay]] and J. Hogarth repeated the experiments with sodium in 1879–1880. W. Weyl in 1844 and C.A. Seely in 1871 were the first to use liquid ammonia. [[Hamilton Cady]] in 1897 was the first to relate the ionizing properties of ammonia to that of water.  [[Charles A. Kraus]] measured the [[electrical conductance]] of metal ammonia solutions and in 1907 was the first to attribute it the electrons liberated from the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kraus | first1 = Charles A. | year = 1907 | title = Solutions of Metals in Non-Metallic Solvents; I. General Properties of Solutions of Metals in Liquid Ammonia | url = | journal = [[J. Am. Chem.

Argo  introduced the solvated electron concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gibson | first1 = G. E. | last2 = Argo | first2 = W.

In the 1970s, solid salts containing [[electride|electrons as the anion]] were characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dye, J.

[[Image:John Gould Emu.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Emu]] from ''The Birds of Australia''.]]
'''''The Birds of Australia''''' was a book written by [[John Gould]] and published in seven volumes between 1840 and 1848. It was the first comprehensive survey of the [[birds of Australia]] and included descriptions of 681 species, 328 of which were new to science and were first described by Gould.

Gould and his wife [[Elizabeth Gould (illustrator)|Elizabeth]] travelled to Australia from England in 1838 to prepare the book. They spent a little under two years collecting specimens for the book. John travelled widely and made extensive collections of Australian birds and other fauna. Elizabeth, who had illustrated several of his earlier works, made hundreds of drawings from specimens for publication in ''The Birds of Australia''&lt;ref&gt;Linda Hall Library.

The plates of the book were produced by [[lithography]], Elizabeth produced 84 plates before she died in 1841, [[Edward Lear]] produced one, [[Waterhouse Hawkins]] contributed one and the remaining 595 plates were produced by [[Henry Constantine Richter|H. C. Richter]] from Elizabeth's drawings and were published under his name.&lt;ref name = "NLA"&gt;Hetherington, M.

'''United States energy law''' is a function of the federal government, states, and local governments. At the federal level, it is regulated extensively through the [[United States Department of Energy]].
Every state, the Federal government, and the [[District of Columbia]] collect some [[motor vehicle]] [[excise tax]]es.&lt;ref name="MVET Rates"&gt;[http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/motor_fl.html Motor Fuel Excise Tax Rates as of January 1, 2008 from the Federation of Tax Administrators website].

The practice of energy law has been the domain of [[law firm]]s working on behalf of [[utility]] companies, rather than [[legal scholar]]s or other legal actors (such as private [[lawyer]]s and [[paralegal]]s), especially in [[Texas]], but this is changing.  Some officials from energy agencies may take jobs in the utilities or other companies they regulate, such as the former [[FERC]] chairman did in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;"Former FERC Chairman Joins [[Husch Blackwell Sanders]]", August 4, 2008, found at

The [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) has a ''Section of Environment, Energy, and Resources'', which is a "forum for lawyers working in areas related to environmental law, natural resources law, and energy law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/environ/ Section of Environment, Energy, and Resources of the American Bar Association website].

==Common law==
Under the [[common law]], persons who owned [[real property]] owned "[[Cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos|from the depths to the heavens]]".&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;Thomas Merrill, ''Establishing Ownership: First Possession versus Accession,'' p. 14, fn. 22-23, Law and Economics Workshop (University of California, Berkeley 2007 Paper 3), found at [http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1174&amp;context=berkeley_law_econ CDLib website]. Retrieved September 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Written as ''cjus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum et ad inferos.'' This has been translated as "To whomever the soil belongs, he owns also to the sky and the depths." Black's Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990).  From Merrill, fn. 22, ''[[q.v.]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[real estate]] traditionally has included all rights to water, oil, gas, and other minerals underground.&lt;ref name=Merrill /&gt;  The [[United States Supreme Court]] has held that as far as [[air rights]], "this doctrine has no place in the modern world,"&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Causby]],'' 328 U.S. 256, 261 (1942), see {{ussc|328|256|1946}}. From Merrill, fn. 23, ''[[q.v.]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; but it remains as a source of law to this day, or "fundamental to property rights in land."&lt;ref name=Merrill /&gt;

An [[easement]] or [[license]] to drill for oil, gas, or minerals generally runs with the [[Real property|land]], and thus is an [[appurtenant easement]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  However, a utility easement generally runs with the owner of the [[easement]], rather than running with the land, and as such, is an example of an [[Easement#Easement in gross|easement in gross]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The West digest system, used in [[WestLaw]], has allocated several topics in energy law:
* 114 – Customs duties
* 145 – Electricity
* 190 – Gas
* 371 – Taxation.

There are many library research resources available about American oil and gas law.&lt;ref name=Cooley&gt;"OIL AND GAS LAW: A Selective Research Guide," from the [http://www.cooley.edu/library/research_guides/Oil_Gas_Law.pdf Cooley Law School website].

==Federal laws==

{{See also|List of United States federal legislation|Energy Information Administration}}

Previous to the 1920s, the role of the Federal government in energy was restricted to the disposition of oil, gas, and coal on Federal lands. The [[Mineral Leasing Act of 1920]] {{USC|30|181}} et seq. is the major Federal law that authorizes and governs [[lease|leasing]] of [[public land]]s for developing deposits of [[hydrocarbons]] and other minerals.  Previous to the act, these materials were subject to mining claims under the [[General Mining Act of 1872]].  In ''[[BP America Production Co. v. Burton]]'', [[Case citation|549 U.S. 84]] (2006), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that a [[statute of limitations]] does not apply to government [[lawsuit|actions]] for [[contract]] claims for an agency to recover royalties on such leases.

Concerned that a predicted immanent shortage of petroleum would not leave enough fuel for naval vessels, President William Howard Taft established the first Naval Petroleum Reserve by withdrawing Federal land over the [[Elk Hills Oil Field]] in California from being claimed and drilled by private companies. A number of additional Naval Petroleum Reserves and Naval Oil Shale Reserves were established by Taft and his successor, Woodrow Wilson.

Until the 1920s, "the federal government did not play an active role in the energy industries," sometimes explained as due to "the widespread belief in the unlimited supply of energy."&lt;ref name=cornell&gt;[http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/energy Cornell Law School website]. Retrieved August 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first US law was the [[Federal Power Act|Federal Power Act of 1920]] (later amended in 1935 and 1986).&lt;ref name=cornell /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kannerandassoc.com/ Federal Energy Law Summaries online].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/fedpowr.html Federal Power laws online].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theorator.com/bills108/s716.html Federal Power Act Amendments Act of 2003 at The Orator website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204041630/http://www.theorator.com/bills108/s716.html |date=February 4, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Manhattan Project]] of the 1940s "initiated the era of nuclear regulation."&lt;ref name=cornell /&gt;  In 1946, the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946|Atomic Energy Act]] was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Pub.L. 1946, ch. 724, 60 Stat. 755, {{USPL|60|755}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act]] was first enacted in 1957, and has been renewed periodically, which governs a [[no-fault insurance]] regime for [[nuclear accident]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pub.L. 1957, 85 Stat. 257, {{USPL|85|257}}, codified at 42 U.S. ch. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The statute was upheld as constitutional in ''[[Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group]]'', 438 U.S. 59 (1978).&lt;ref&gt;''Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group'', 438 U.S. 59 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Energy and its constituent [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) were created in 1977,&lt;ref name=cornell /&gt; through the [[Department of Energy Organization Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Pub.L. 95-238, 92 Stat. 47, {{USPL|95|238}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The stated purposes of these "federal energy laws and regulations is to provide affordable energy by sustaining competitive markets, while protecting the economic, environmental, and security interests of the United States."&lt;ref name=cornell /&gt;  The U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) regulates the use of [[nuclear power]] and its uses as a [[Atom bomb|defense weaponry]].&lt;ref name=cornell /&gt;

Other statutes are the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act]],&lt;ref&gt;PURPA, at {{USPL|95|617}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Energy Security Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|96|294}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act]], and the [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]]&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|102|486}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these laws are codified at [[U.S. Code]], Title 16, Chapter 12 – Federal regulation and development of power.  The [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]] also affects energy trading companies.  The [[Oil Pollution Act of 1973]] and [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]] affect the transportation of oil on the [[high seas]].

As of January 1, 2008, the Federal excise tax is 18.3 [[cent (currency)|cents]] per [[gallon]] on gasoline, 24.3 cents per gallon on diesel, and 13 cents per gallon on [[gasohol]].&lt;ref name="MVET Rates" /&gt;

===Energy Policy Act of 2005===
{{Main|Energy Policy Act of 2005}}
The most recent major law is the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], which was an attempt to combat growing energy problems, changed the [[energy policy of the United States]] by providing tax incentives and loan guarantees for energy production of various types.

==State laws==
The states affect energy in numerous ways, including taxes, land use controls, regulation of energy utilities, and energy subsidies. States may establish environmental standards stricter than those set by the federal government. Regulation of oil and gas production, particularly on non-federal land, is largely left up to the states.

===Alaska law===
{{Main|Alaska#Energy}}
[[File:Alaska Crude Oil Production.PNG|thumb|Alaska oil production peaked in 1988 and has declined 65% since]]
[[Alaska]] has vast energy resources:
* Major oil and gas reserves are found in the [[Prudhoe Bay]] area of the [[Alaska North Slope]] (ANS) and [[Cook Inlet]] basins. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], Alaska ranks second in the [[United States|nation]] in [[crude oil production]], accounting for 1/5 (20%) of United States oil production, Prudhoe Bay alone accounting for 8% of the United States domestic oil production.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] pumps up to {{convert|2.1|Moilbbl|m3}} of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States.
* Substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins. The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are {{convert|85.4|Tcuft|km3}} of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgs.gov/corecast/details.asp?ep=74 Gas Hydrates on Alaska's North Slope] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601170523/http://www.usgs.gov/corecast/details.asp?ep=74 |date=2010-06-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alaska also offers some of the highest [[hydroelectric power]] potential in the country from its numerous rivers, and large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=AK |title= EIA State Energy Profiles: Alaska |date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2001, the state's Energy Plan stated that, although [[wind power|wind]] and [[hydroelectric power]] are abundant, with [[single-wire earth return#Use in interties|low-cost electric interties]] they were judged uneconomical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf Screening Report for Alaska Rural Energy Plan], April 2001 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216014031/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |date=February 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Alaska receives a large proportion of its state revenues from its [[severance tax]] on oil: a full 68% of all revenue, much more than any state (only [[Wyoming]] coming close).&lt;ref name="taxdis" /&gt;  Its dependence on [[petroleum]] revenues and federal subsidies allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;CNN Money (2005).

The most populous state in the United States, [[California]] has gone through a series of [[California Energy crisis|energy crises]], and has reacted with several laws concerning energy.  The [[California Energy Code]], or Title 24 of the [[California Code of Regulations]], also titled "The Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings", were established in 1978 in response to a legislative mandate to reduce California's [[Domestic energy consumption|energy consumption]]. The standards are updated periodically to allow consideration and possible incorporation of new [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] technologies and methods, such as the [[Programmable Communicating Thermostat]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24 Official code] and [http://www.bsc.ca.gov/title_24 BSC website].&lt;/ref&gt;

Town of Dryden''  __ N.Y.S.2d ___ (Index # 2012-0902) (N.Y. Supreme Ct. Tompkins Co. February 21, 2012), and ''Cooperstown Holstein Corp. v. Town of Middletown'', __ N.Y.S.2d ___ (Index # 2012-0930) (N.Y. Supreme Ct. Otsego Co. February 24, 2012).
