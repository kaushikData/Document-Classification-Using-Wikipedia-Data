'''1953 in philosophy'''

== Events ==
* [[Internationale Hegelgesellschaft]] (International Hegel Society) was founded in 1953.
*[[Rudolf Carnap]] publishes an article called "Testability and Meaning" in ''Readings in the Philosophy of Science'', which moves away from the philosophical position of [[logical positivism]] with respect to science (particularly the heavily mathematical sciences, such as physics). Carnap instead emphasizes the idea that progress in science depends on the gradual accumulation of many small results that support human understanding of the world, a view more in line with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy and the biological sciences.

== Publications ==
* [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], ''[[A New Critique of Theoretical Thought]], Volume I The Necessary Presuppositinos of Philosophy'' (1953)
* [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], ''[[The Principal Upanishads (book)|The Principal Upanishads]]'' (1953)
* [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' (1953)
* [[Martin Heidegger]], ''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Heidegger)|Introduction to Metaphysics]]'' (1953)
* [[Czesław Miłosz]], ''[[The Captive Mind]]'' (1953)

== Births ==
* March 5 - [[Michael Sandel]] 
* June 2 - [[Cornel West]]

== Deaths ==
* April 9 - [[Hans Reichenbach]] (born 1891)
* September 28 - [[Edwin Hubble]] (born 1889)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12611">{{Grammatical categories}}
In [[linguistics]] and [[grammar]], '''affirmation''' and '''negation''' ([[List of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] respectively '''{{sc|aff}}''' and '''{{sc|neg}}''') are the ways that grammar encode negative and positive polarity in [[verb phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, or other [[utterance]]s. Essentially an affirmative (positive) form is used to express the validity or [[truth]] of a basic assertion, while a negative form expresses its falsity. Examples are the [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s "Jane is here" and "Jane is not here"; the first is affirmative, while the second is negative.

The [[grammatical category]] associated and with affirmative and negative is called '''polarity'''. This means that a sentence, verb phrase, etc. may be said to have either affirmative or negative polarity (its polarity may be either affirmative or negative). Affirmative is typically the unmarked polarity, whereas a negative statement is marked in some way, whether by a negating word or particle such as [[English grammar|English]] ''not'', an [[affix]] such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] -''nai'', or by other means, which reverses the meaning of the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. The process of converting affirmative to negative is called '''negation''' – the grammatical rules for negation vary from language to language, and a given language may have more than one method of doing so.

Affirmative and negative responses (especially, though not exclusively, to [[question]]s) are often expressed using [[particle (grammar)|particle]]s or words such as [[yes and no|''yes'' and ''no'']], where ''yes'' is the affirmative and ''no'' the negative particle.

==Affirmative and negative responses==
{{main article|Yes and no}}
Special affirmative and negative words ([[particle (grammar)|particle]]s) are often found in responses to questions, and sometimes to other assertions by way of agreement or disagreement. In English, these are ''yes'' and ''no'' respectively, in French ''oui'', ''si'' and ''non'', in Swedish ''ja'', ''jo'' and ''nej'', and so on. Not all languages make such common use of particles of this type; in some (such as [[Welsh grammar|Welsh]]) it is more common to repeat the verb or another part of the predicate, with or without negation accordingly.

Complications sometimes arise in the case of responses to negative statements or questions; in some cases the response that confirms a negative statement is the negative particle (as in English: "You're not going out? No."), but in some languages this is reversed. Some languages have a distinct form to answer a negative question, such as French ''si'' and Swedish ''jo'' (these serve to contradict the negative statement suggested by the first speaker).

== Grammatical rules for negation ==

===Simple negation of verbs and clauses===
Languages have a variety of [[grammar|grammatical]] rules for converting affirmative [[verb phrase]]s or [[clause]]s into negative ones.

In many languages, an affirmative is made negative by the addition of a [[grammatical particle|particle]], meaning "not". This may be added before the [[verb phrase]], as with the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''no'':
* ''Está en casa.'' ("(S)he is at home", affirmative)
* '''''No''' está en casa.'' ("(S)he is not at home", negative)
Other examples of negating particles preceding the verb phrase include [[Italian language|Italian]] ''non'', [[Russian grammar|Russian]] не ''nye'' and [[Polish grammar|Polish]] ''nie'' (they can also be found in [[constructed language]]s: ''ne'' in [[Esperanto language|Esperanto]] and ''non'' in [[Interlingua grammar|Interlingua]]). In some other languages the negating particle follows the verb or verb phrase, as in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]:
*''Ik zie hem.'' ("I see him", affirmative)
*''Ik zie hem '''niet'''.'' ("I do not see him", negative)
Particles following the verb in this way include ''not'' in archaic and dialectal [[English language|English]] ("you remember not"), ''nicht'' in [[German language|German]] (''ich schlafe nicht'', "I am not sleeping"), and ''inte'' in [[Swedish Language|Swedish]] (''han hoppade inte'', "he did not jump").

In [[French language|French]], particles are added both before the verb phrase (''ne'') and after the verb (''pas''):
*''Je sais'' ("I know", affirmative)
*''Je '''ne''' sais '''pas''''' ("I don't know", negative).
However, in colloquial French the first particle is often omitted: ''Je sais pas''. Similar use of two negating particles can also be found in [[Afrikaans]]: ''Hy kan '''nie''' Afrikaans praat '''nie''''' ("He cannot speak Afrikaans").

In standard [[Modern English]], negation is achieved by adding ''not'' after an [[auxiliary verb]] (which here means one of a special grammatical class of verbs that also includes forms of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be''; see [[English auxiliaries]]). If no such verb is present then the [[Auxiliary verb#Dummy|dummy auxiliary]] ''do'' (''does'', ''did'') is introduced – see [[do-support|''do''-support]].  For example:
*I have gone → I have '''not''' gone (''have'' is the auxiliary)
*He goes → He '''does not''' go (no auxiliary in the original sentence)
Different rules apply in [[subjunctive]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[non-finite clause|non-finite]] clauses. For more details see {{slink|English grammar|Negation}}. (In [[Middle English]], the particle ''not'' could follow any verb, e.g. "I see not the horse.")

In some languages, like [[Welsh language|Welsh]], verbs have special inflections to be used in negative clauses. (In some language families, this may lead to reference to a negative [[grammatical mood|mood]].) An example is [[Japanese language|Japanese]], which conjugates verbs in the negative after adding the suffix ''-nai'' (indicating negation), e.g. ''taberu'' ("eat") and ''tabe'''nai''''' ("do not eat"). It could be argued that English has joined the ranks of these languages, since negation requires the use of an auxiliary verb and a distinct [[syntax]] in most cases; the form of the basic verb can change on negation, as in "he '''sings'''" vs. "he doesn't '''sing'''". [[Arnold Zwicky|Zwicky]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum|Pullum]] have shown that ''n't'' is an [[inflection]]al suffix, not a [[clitic]] or a derivational suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complex rules for negation also apply in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]; see {{slink|Finnish grammar|Negation of verbs}}. In some languages negation may also affect the dependents of the verb; for example in some [[Slavic languages]], such as [[Russian language|Russian]], the [[grammatical case|case]] of a [[direct object]] often changes from [[accusative]] to [[genitive]] when the verb is negated.

===Negation of other elements===
Negation can be applied not just to whole verb phrases, clauses or sentences, but also to specific elements (such as [[adjective]]s and [[noun phrase]]s) within sentences.&lt;ref&gt;The linguist D. Biber refers to two types of negation, synthetic ('no', 'neither' or 'nor' negation) and analytic ('not' negation). For example, "He is neither here nor there" (synthetic) or "He is not here" (analytic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ways in which this can be done again depend on the grammar of the language in question. English generally places ''not'' before the negated element, as in "I witnessed '''not a debate''', but a war." There are also negating affixes, such as the English [[prefix]]es ''non-'', ''un-'', ''in-'', etc. Such elements are called [[privative]]s.

===Multiple negation===
{{Main article|Double negative|Litotes}}
There also exist elements which carry a specialized negative meaning, including [[pronoun]]s such as ''nobody'', ''none'' and ''nothing'', [[determiners]] such as ''no'' (as in "no apples"), and adverbs such as ''never'', ''no longer'' and ''nowhere''.

Although such elements themselves have negative force, in some languages a clause in which they appear is additionally marked for ordinary negation. For example, in Russian, "I see nobody" is expressed as я никого́ не ви́жу ''ja nikovó nye vízhu'', literally "I nobody not see" – the ordinary negating particle не ''nye'' ("not") is used in addition to the negative pronoun никого́  ''nikovó'' ("nobody"). Italian behaves in a similar way: ''Non ti vede nessuno'', "nobody can see you", although ''Nessuno ti vede'' is also a possible clause with exactly the same meaning.

In  [[Russian language|Russian]], all of the elements ("not", "never", "nobody", "nowhere") would appear together in the sentence in their negative form. In Italian, a clause works much as in Russian, but ''non'' does not have to be there, and can be there only before the verb if it precedes all other negative elements: ''Tu non porti mai nessuno da nessuna parte''. "Nobody ever brings you anything here", however, could be translated ''Nessuno qui ti porta mai niente'' or ''Qui non ti porta mai niente nessuno''. In French, where simple negation is performed using ''ne ... pas'' (see above), specialized negatives appear in combination with the first particle (''ne''), but ''pas'' is omitted:
*''Je '''ne''' bois '''jamais''''' ("I '''never''' drink")
*''Je '''ne''' vois '''personne''''' ("I see '''nobody'''")
*''Je '''n'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''ai '''jamais''' vu '''personne''''' ("I have '''never''' seen '''anybody'''") 
  
In [[Ancient Greek]], a simple negative (οὐ ''ou'' "not" or μή ''mḗ'' "not ([[Linguistic modality|modal]])") following another simple or compound negative (e.g. οὐδείς ''oudeís'' "nobody") results in an affirmation, whereas a compound negative following a simple or compound negative strengthens the negation:
* οὐδεὶς οὐκ ἔπασχέ τι ''oudeìs ouk épaskhé ti'', "nobody was not suffering something", i.e. "everybody was suffering"
* μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ''mḕ thorubḗsēi mēdeís'', "let (not) nobody raise an uproar", meaning "let nobody raise an uproar"

==Meaning of negation==
Simple grammatical negation of a clause in principle has the effect of converting a proposition to its [[negation|logical negation]] – replacing an assertion that something is the case by an assertion that it is not the case.

In some cases, however, particularly when a particular [[linguistic modality|modality]] is expressed, the semantic effect of negation may be somewhat different. For example, in English, the meaning of "you must not go" is not in fact the exact negation of that of "you must go" – this would be expressed as "you don't have to go" or "you needn't go". The negation "must not" has a stronger meaning (the effect is to apply the logical negation to the following infinitive rather than to the full clause with ''must''). For more details and other similar cases, see the relevant sections of [[English modal verbs]].

In some cases, by way of [[irony]], an affirmative statement may be intended to have the meaning of the corresponding negative, or vice versa. For examples see [[antiphrasis]] and [[sarcasm]].

For the use of double negations or similar as understatements ("not unappealing", "not bad", etc.) see [[litotes]].

'''''Amour de soi''''' (French, "self-love") is a concept in the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] that refers to the kind of [[self-love]] that humans share with brute animals and predates the appearance of society. Acts committed out of ''amour de soi'' tend to be for individual well-being. They are naturally good and not malicious because ''amour de soi'' as self-love does not involve pursuing one's self-interest at the expense of others. The sentiment does not compare oneself with others, but is concerned solely with regarding oneself as an absolute and valuable existence. It is related to an awareness of one's future and can restrain present impulse. Rousseau contrasts it with ''[[amour-propre]]'', that kind of self-love, found in [[Thomas Hobbes]]' philosophy, in which one's opinion of oneself is dependent on what other people think and which arises only with society.

Rousseau suggested that ''amour de soi'' was lost during the transition from the pre-societal condition to society, but it can be restored by the use of "good" institutions created with the [[social contract]]. This renewed passage from the [[state of nature]] to the civilized state, would bring man to favor [[justice]] instead of [[instinct]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Derathé, ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau et la science politique de son temps'', Paris, Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, 1995, pp. 135-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Inquiry into the Good''''', also known as '''''A Study of Good''''', ({{lang-ja|善の研究, Zen no kenkyū}}) is a 1911 book by the Japanese philosopher [[Kitaro Nishida]]. The work has been described as a masterpiece.

==Influence and reception==
Graham Parkes, writing in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (2005), described ''An Inquiry into the Good'' as a "masterpiece" that was made possible by the Japanese interest in western philosophy that began with the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868. He considered the book "path-breaking" and identified it as Nishida's best known accomplishment.{{sfn|Parkes|2005|pages=458, 659}}

[[Ninian Smart]], writing in ''World Philosophies'' (2008), stated that the book "struck many readers as the first truly creative work by a Japanese that did not merely repeat western ideas, and yet made use of modern thinking and terminology." However, according to Smart, the work was criticized by the philosopher Takahashi Satomi, who found the subjectivism of "pure experience" too psychological.{{sfn|Smart|2008|pages=426, 430}}

==Overview&lt;!--'Psychologism dispute' redirects here--&gt;==
The anti-psychologistic approach to logic originated in the work of [[Bernard Bolzano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bolzano/ Bernard Bolzano (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]; ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1998): "Ryle, Gilbert (1900-76)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of anti-psychologism was further developed by [[Gottlob Frege]] (the most famous anti-psychologist of [[Mathematical logic|logic]]), and has been the centre of an important debate in early [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[analytical philosophy]]. 

Elements of anti-psychologism in the [[historiography of philosophy]] can be found in the work of the members of the 1830s [[speculative theist]] movement&lt;ref&gt;William R. Woodward, ''Hermann Lotze: An Intellectual Biography'', Cambridge University Press, 2015, pp. 74–5.&lt;/ref&gt; and the late work of [[Hermann Lotze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=hermann-lotze |title=Hermann Lotze |last=Sullivan |first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''psychologism dispute'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{lang-de|Psychologismusstreit}})&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Rath, ''Der Psychologismusstreit in der deutschen Philosophie'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; in 19th-century German-speaking philosophy is closely related to the contemporary [[internalism and externalism]] debate in [[epistemology]]; [[psychologism]] is often construed as a kind of internalism (the thesis that no fact about the world can provide reasons for action independently of desires and beliefs) and anti-psychologism as a kind of externalism (the thesis that reasons are to be identified with objective features of the world).&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppina D'Oro, [https://www.academia.edu/241389/Collingwood_Psychologism_and_Internalism "Collingwood, psychologism and internalism,"] ''European Journal of Philosophy'' '''12'''(2):163–177 (2004): "internalism is often associated with psychologism".&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologism was defended by [[Theodor Lipps]], [[Gerardus Heymans]], [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[Wilhelm Jerusalem]], [[Christoph von Sigwart]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Theodor Elsenhans|de}}, and [[Benno Erdmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism/#ExaPsyRea Psychologism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy): "Examples of Psychologistic Reasoning"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edmund Husserl]] was another important proponent of anti-psychologism, and this trait passed on to other phenomenologists, such as [[Martin Heidegger]], whose doctoral thesis was meant to be a refutation of psychologism. They shared the argument that, because the proposition "no-p is a not-p" is not [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to "It is thought that 'no-p is a not-p'", psychologism does not logically stand. Psychologism was criticized in logic also by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]&lt;ref&gt;Peirce attacked the idea, held by some logicians at that time, that rationality rests on a feeling of logicality, rather than on fact. See the first of Peirce's 1903 [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Lectures by Peirce|Lowell Institute Lectures]] "What Makes a Reasoning Sound?", ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce#EP|Essential Peirce]]'' v. 2, pp. 242–257. See also the portion of Peirce's 1902 ''Minute Logic'' published in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 2 (1931), paragraphs 18–19 and 39–43. Peirce held that mathematical and philosophical logics [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|precede]] psychology as a special science and that they do not depend on it for principles.&lt;/ref&gt; whose fields included logic, philosophy, and experimental psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (sometimes with [[Joseph Jastrow]]) investigated the [[Bayesian probability|probability judgments]] of experimental subjects, pioneering [[decision analysis]]. He and Jastrow wrote "On Small Differences in Sensation", ''Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences'' (1885), 3, 73–83, presented 17 October 1884, reprinted in [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]] v. 7, paragraphs 21–35. ''Classics in the History of Psychology''. [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; and generally in philosophy by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] who held the chairs of philosophy and child psychology&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Jack (as last updated 2005), "Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908–1961)", ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/merleau/ Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Paris]].

Psychologism is not widely held amongst logicians today, but it does have some high-profile defenders, for example [[Dov Gabbay]].

==History==
''See also'': [[History of genomics]]

Comparative genomics has a root in the comparison of [[virus]] genomes in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=koonin/&gt; For example, small [[RNA viruses]] infecting animals ([[picornaviruses]]) and those infecting plants ([[cowpea mosaic virus]]) were compared and turned out to share significant sequence similarity and, in part, the order of their genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 12| issue = 18| pages = 7251–7267| authors = Argos, P.; Kamer, G.; Nicklin, M.J.; Wimmer, E.| title = Similarity in gene organization and homology between proteins of animal picornaviruses and a plant comovirus suggest common ancestry of these virus families| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| year = 1984| doi = 10.1093/nar/12.18.7251}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the first comparative genomic study at a larger scale was published, comparing the genomes of [[varicella-zoster virus]] and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] that contained more than 100 genes each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 14| issue = 10| pages = 4281–4292| first1 = D.J.|last1= McGeoch

The first complete genome sequence of a cellular organism, that of ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' Rd, was published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fleischmann R, Adams M, White O, Clayton R, Kirkness E, Kerlavage A, Bult C, Tomb J, Dougherty B, Merrick J |title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of ''Haemophilus influenzae'' Rd |journal=Science |volume=269 |issue=5223 |pages=496–512 |year=1995 | doi=10.1126/science.7542800 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/269/5223/496 |pmid=7542800|bibcode = 1995Sci...269..496F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second genome sequencing paper was of the small parasitic bacterium ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' published in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fraser |first=Claire M. |year=1995 |title=The Minimal Gene Complement of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' |journal=Science |volume=270 |issue=5235 |pages=397–404 |doi=10.1126/science.270.5235.397 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=7569993|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 1995Sci...270..397F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from this paper, reports on new genomes inevitably became comparative-genomic studies.&lt;ref name=koonin/&gt;

The first high-resolution whole genome comparison system was developed in 1998 by Art Delcher, Simon Kasif and Steven Salzberg and applied to the comparison of entire highly related microbial organisms with their collaborators at the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). The system is called  [[MUMmer|MUMMER]] and was described in a publication in Nucleic Acids Research in 1999. The system helps researchers to identify large rearrangements, single base mutations, reversals, tandem repeat expansions and other polymorphisms.  In bacteria, MUMMER enables the identification of polymorphisms that are responsible for virulence, pathogenicity, and anti-biotic resistance. The system was also applied to the Minimal Organism Project at TIGR and subsequently to many other comparative genomics projects.

With the publication of the large genomes of vertebrates in the 2000s, including [[Human Genome Project|human]], the [[Japanese pufferfish]] ''[[Takifugu rubripes]]'', and [[House mouse|mouse]], precomputed results of large genome comparisons have been released for downloading or for visualization in a [[genome browser]].

[[Next-generation sequencing]] methods, which were first introduced in 2007, have produced an enormous amount of genomic data and have allowed researchers to generate multiple (prokaryotic) draft genome sequences at once. These methods can also quickly uncover [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]], [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]] and [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]] by mapping [[Sequence assembly|unassembled reads]] against a well [[Genome annotation|annotated]] reference genome, and thus provide a list of possible gene differences that may be the basis for any functional variation among strains.&lt;ref name=hu/&gt;

==Evolutionary principles==
One character of biology is evolution, evolutionary theory is also the theoretical foundation of comparative genomics, and at the same time the results of comparative genomics unprecedentedly enriched and developed the theory of evolution. When two or more of the genome sequence are compared, one can deduce the evolutionary relationships of the sequences in a phylogenetic tree. Based on a variety of biological genome data and the study of vertical and horizontal evolution processes, one can understand vital parts of the gene structure and its regulatory function.

Similarity of related genomes is the basis of comparative genomics. If two creatures have a recent common ancestor, the differences between the two species genomes are evolved from the ancestors’ genome. The closer the relationship between two organisms, the higher the similarities between their genomes. If there is close relationship between them, then their genome will display a linear behaviour ([[synteny]]), namely some or all of the genetic sequences are conserved. Thus, the genome sequences can be used to identify gene function, by analyzing their homology (sequence similarity) to genes of known function.

Orthologous sequences are related sequences in different species: a gene exists in the original species, the species divided into two species, so genes in new species are orthologous to the sequence in the original species. Paralogous sequences are separated by gene cloning (gene duplication): if a particular gene in the genome is copied, then the copy of the two sequences is paralogous to the original gene. A pair of orthologous sequences is called orthologous pairs (orthologs), a pair of paralogous sequence is called collateral pairs (paralogs). Orthologous pairs usually have the same or similar function, which is not necessarily the case for  collateral pairs. In collateral pairs, the sequences tend to evolve into having different functions.

[[File:BrowserFoxp2.jpg| Human [[FOXP2]] gene and evolutionary conservation is shown in and multiple alignment (at bottom of figure) in this image from the [[UCSC Genome Browser]].  Note that conservation tends to cluster around coding regions (exons). |thumb|right]]
Comparative genomics exploits both similarities and differences in the [[proteins]], [[RNA]], and [[regulatory regions]] of different organisms to infer how [[Selection (biology)|selection]] has acted upon these elements.  Those elements that are responsible for similarities between different [[species]] should be conserved through time ([[stabilizing selection]]), while those elements responsible for differences among species should be divergent ([[Directional selection|positive selection]]).  Finally, those elements that are unimportant to the evolutionary success of the organism will be unconserved (selection is neutral).

One of the important goals of the field is the identification of the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution. It is however often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism. For this reason comparative genomics studies of small [[model organisms]] (for example the model [[Caenorhabditis elegans]] and closely related [[Caenorhabditis briggsae]]) are of great importance to advance our understanding of general mechanisms of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stein, L.D. |year=2003 |title=The genome sequence of Caenorhabditis briggsae: a platform for comparative genomics |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=E45 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000045 |pmid=14624247 |pmc=261899|display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Newly Sequenced Worm a Boon for Worm Biologists | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = e4–e4 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000044}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

==Polymorphisms==
===Single nucleotide polymorphisms===

SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) refers to the genome level by single nucleotide position, such as transformation or transversion mutation caused the DNA sequence polymorphism. According to the SNP in gene location, it can be divided into 3 classes: the genes code area SNP (coding - region SNPS, cSNP), gene surrounding SNP (perigenic SNPS, pSNP) and gene SNP (intergenic SNPS, iSNP). Published on February 17, 2005, the first human gene polymorphisms mapping is based on gene "linkage disequilibrium theory", using gene chip in 71 European Americans (white), African Americans (black) and the han Chinese Americans (yellow race), this research identified 1.58 million single nucleotide mutation of DNA locus, the map will help to predict the likelihood of certain diseases and make the best treatment plan, make an important step in the journey which based on gene of individualized health goals.

===Copy number polymorphism===
Before the invention of whole genome sequencing and gene chip technology, limited by high-throughput DNA genome copy number detection means, within the scope of the whole genome copy number polymorphism (copy number polymorphism, CNP), people know very little about the number and distribution. In 2004, a number of "human genome project" research bases in the world accidentally found that in the phenotypes of normal population, there are some differences in some gene copy numbers between different individuals, some people lost a lot of gene copy, while others have extra, extend the copies of the gene, the researchers call this phenomenon of “polymorphic gene copy number". It was because the CNP that caused the different between individuals such as disease, appetite and efficacy. Research shows that it has average 11 differences between 2 individuals, the average length of CNP is 465 KB, of which more than half of the CNP are repeated in more than one individual, and often in other types of chromosome rearrangement nearby.

==Classification==
===Interspecific comparative genomics===
Through the comparison of different related species genome sequence, can identify coding sequences, regulation and control of non-coding sequences and unique sequence of a given species. And within the scope of genome sequence alignment, can understand the similarities and differences in gene sequence, nucleotide composition, linear relationship of different objects, and then get the aspects of information about forecasts and positioning of genetic analysis, evolutionary relationship between biological systems.

===Intraspecific comparative genomics===
With same population in genome，there are a lot of mutation and polymorphism, because of these differences in the genome sequence constitutes the different disease susceptibility and genetic basis of different reactions to drugs and environmental factors in individuals and groups.

==Tools==

Computational tools for analyzing sequences and complete genomes are developing quickly due to the availability of large amount of genomic data. At the same time, comparative analysis tools are progressed and improved. In the challenges about these analyses, it is very important to visualize the comparative results.&lt;ref name="Humana Press"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Bergman, N.H. |title=Comparative Genomics: Volumes 1 and 2 |location=Totowa, New Jersey |publisher=Humana Press |year=2007 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1732/ |isbn=978-193411-537-4 |pmid=21250292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visualization of sequence conservation is a tough task of comparative sequence analysis. As we know, it is highly inefficient to examine the alignment of long genomic regions manually. Internet-based genome browsers provide many useful tools for investigating genomic sequences due to integrating all sequence-based biological information on genomic regions. When we extract large amount of relevant biological data, they can be very easy to use and less time-consuming.&lt;ref name="Humana Press"/&gt;

An advantage of using online tools is that these websites are being developed and updated constantly. There are many new settings and content can be used online to improve efficiency.&lt;ref name="Humana Press"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Agriculture===

Agriculture is a field that reaps the benefits of comparative genomics. Identifying the [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] of advantageous genes is a key step in breeding crops that are optimized for greater yield, cost-efficiency, quality, and disease resistance. For example, one genome wide association study conducted on 517 rice [[landrace]]s revealed 80 loci associated with several categories of agronomic performance, such as grain weight, [[amylose]] content, and drought tolerance. Many of the loci were previously uncharacterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huang, X.H.  |year=2010 |title=Genome-wide association studies of 14 agronomic traits in rice landraces  |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=42 |issue=11 |page=961-U76 |doi=10.1038/ng.695 |display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is this methodology powerful, it is also quick. Previous methods of identifying loci associated with agronomic performance required several generations of carefully monitored breeding of parent strains, a time consuming effort that is unnecessary for comparative genomic studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Morrell, P.L., Buckler, E.S., Ross-Ibara, J. |year=2012 |title=Crop genomics: advances and applications |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=85–96 |doi=10.1038/nrg3097}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
The medical field also benefits from the study of comparative genomics. Vaccinology in particular has experienced useful advances in technology due to genomic approaches to problems. In an approach known as [[reverse vaccinology]], researchers can discover candidate antigens for vaccine development by analyzing the genome of a pathogen or a family of pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Seib, K.L., Zhao, X., Rappuoli, R. |year=2012 |title=Developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=18 |issue=SI |pages=109–116 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03939.x}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying a comparative genomics approach by analyzing the genomes of several related pathogens can lead to the development of vaccines that are multiprotective. A team of researchers employed such an approach to create a universal vaccine for [[Streptococcus agalactiae|Group B Streptococcus]], a group of bacteria responsible for severe neonatal infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maione, D.  |year=2005 |title=Identification of a Universal Group B Streptococcus Vaccine by Multiple Genome Screen |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5731 |pages=148–150 |doi=10.1126/science.1109869 |display-authors=etal |bibcode = 2005Sci...309..148M |pmid=15994562 |pmc=1351092}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative genomics can also be used to generate specificity for vaccines against pathogens that are closely related to commensal microorganisms. For example, researchers used comparative genomic analysis of commensal and pathogenic strains of E. coli to identify pathogen specific genes as a basis for finding antigens that result in immune response against pathogenic strains but not commensal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rasco, D.A.  |year=2008 |title=The pangenome structure of Escherichia coli: Comparative genomic analysis of E-coli commensal and pathogenic isolates  |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=190 |issue=20 |pages=6881–6893 |doi=10.1128/JB.00619-08|display-authors=etal |pmid=18676672 |pmc=2566221}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

Comparative genomics also opens up new avenues in other areas of research. As DNA sequencing technology has become more accessible, the number of sequenced genomes has grown. With the increasing reservoir of available genomic data, the potency of comparative genomic inference has grown as well. A notable case of this increased potency is found in recent primate research. Comparative genomic methods have allowed researchers to gather information about genetic variation, differential gene expression, and evolutionary dynamics in primates that were indiscernible using previous data and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rodgers J.; Gibbs R.A. |year=2014 |title=Applications of Next-Generation Sequencing Comparative primate genomics: emerging patterns of genome content and dynamics |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=347–359 |doi=10.1038/nrg3707|pmc=4113315 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Ape Genome Project used comparative genomic methods to investigate genetic variation with reference to the six [[Hominidae|great ape]] species, finding healthy levels of variation in their gene pool despite shrinking population size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prado-Martinez, J.  |year=2013 |title=Great ape genetic diversity and population history |journal=Nature |volume=499 |issue=7459 |pages=471–475 |doi=10.1038/nature12228 |display-authors=etal |bibcode = 2013Natur.499..471P }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that patterns of DNA methylation, which are a known regulation mechanism for gene expression, differ in the prefrontal cortex of humans versus chimps, and implicated this difference in the evolutionary divergence of the two species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Zeng, J.; Konopa, G.; Hunt, B.G.; Preuss, T.M.; Geschwind, D.; Yi, S.V. |year=2012 |title=Divergent Whole-Genome Methylation Maps of Human and Chimpanzee Brains Reveal Epigenetic Basis of Human Regulatory Evolution |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=455–465|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.07.024 |pmid=22922032 |pmc=3511995}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Doctrine]]''' (from {{lang-la|[[Wikt:doctrina|doctrina]]}}, meaning "teaching", "instruction" or "doctrine") is a [[codification (law)|codification]] of beliefs or a body of [[teacher|teachings]] or instructions, taught [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] or positions, as the essence of teachings in a given branch of knowledge or in a [[belief system]]. The [[etymology|etymological]] [[Greece|Greek]] analogue is "[[catechism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100510202232/http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Doctrine Doctrine – Definition at ''WordIQ.com'' 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the word ''doctrine'' specifically suggests a body of [[religion|religious]] principles as [[promulgated]] by a church. ''Doctrine'' may also refer to a principle of law, in the [[common-law]] traditions, established through a history of past decisions, such as the doctrine of [[self-defense]], or the principle of [[fair use]], or the more narrowly applicable [[first-sale doctrine]]. Some organizations simply define ''doctrine'' as "that which is taught", or the basis for [[institution]]al teaching to its personnel of internal ways of operating.

==Religious usage==
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Purgatory]]--&gt;
Examples of religious doctrines include:
* [[Christian theology]]: 
** Doctrines such as the [[Trinity]], the [[Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine)|virgin birth]] and [[atonement in Christianity|atonement]]
** The [[Salvation Army]] ''Handbook of Doctrine'', available in print &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn=978-0-85412-822-8 | title=Handbook of Doctrine | publisher=Salvation Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and online &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.salvationarmy.org/doctrine/handbookdoctrine | title=Handbook of Doctrine website page }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Transubstantiation]] and [[Mariology of the Catholic Church|Marian teachings]] in [[Roman Catholic theology]]. The department of the [[Roman Curia]] which deals with questions of doctrine is called the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/167462/Congregation-for-the-Doctrine-of-the-Faith |title=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (Roman Catholic Church) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfboff.htm |title=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |publisher=Ewtn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The distinctive [[Calvinist]] doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|"double" predestination]]
**The [[Methodist Church of Great Britain]] refers to the "doctrines to which the preachers of the Methodist Church are pledged" as ''doctrinal standards'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.methodist.org.uk/about-us/the-methodist-church/doctrine-of-the-methodist-church/ Doctrine of the Methodist Church], accessed 25 may 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Yuga]]'' in [[Hinduism]]
* Postulation or ''[[Syādvāda]]'' in [[Jainism]]
* The [[Four Noble Truths]] in [[Buddhism]]

===As a measure of religiosity in the sociology of religion===
According to the sociologist [[Mervin F. Verbit|Mervin Verbit]], doctrine may be understood as one of the key components of [[religiosity]], and doctrine itself may be divided into four categories:
* content
* frequency
* intensity
* centrality.

The content of a doctrine may vary from one religion to the next, as will the degree to which it may occupy the person's mind (frequency), the intensity of the doctrine, and the centrality of the doctrine (in that religious tradition).&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M. F. (1970). The components and dimensions of religious behavior: Toward a reconceptualization of religiosity. American mosaic, 24, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Küçükcan, T. (2010). Multidimensional Approach to Religion: a way of looking at religious phenomena. Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies, 4(10), 60–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eskieserler.com/dosyalar/mpdf%20(1135).pdf |title=Microsoft Word - M-26.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense, doctrine is similar to [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]]'s "belief" dimension of religiosity (Glock, 1972: 39).&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings
in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military usage==
The term also applies to the concept of an established procedure to a complex operation in [[war]]fare. The typical example is [[Military doctrine|tactical doctrine]] in which a standard set of maneuvers, kinds of troops and weapons are employed as a default approach to a kind of attack.

Examples of [[military doctrine]]s include:
* ''[[Guerre de course]]''
* [[Hit-and-run tactics]]
* [[Alfred Mahan|Mahanian]] of late 19th up to mid-20th century
* [[Manhunt (military)|Manhunting doctrine]], or assured individual destruction
* [[Reagan Doctrine]] of the Cold War
* [[Shock and Awe]]
* [[Soviet deep battle]] of World War II
* [[Trench warfare]] of World War I

Almost every military organization has its own doctrine, sometimes written, sometimes unwritten. Some military doctrines are transmitted through training programs. More recently, in modern [[peacekeeping operations]], which involve both civilian and military operations, more comprehensive (not just military) doctrines are now emerging such as the 2008 [[United Nations]] peacekeeping operations' "Capstone Doctrine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pbpu.unlb.org/pbps/Library/Capstone_Doctrine_ENG.pdf|title=Peacekeeping Resource Hub|author=|date=|website=pbpu.unlb.org|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which speaks to integrated civilian and military operations.

==Political==
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Political doctrine]]--&gt;
By definition, political doctrine is "[a] policy, position or principle advocated, taught or put into effect concerning the acquisition and exercise of the power to govern or administrate in society."&lt;ref name="eionet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept?cp=6381&amp;langcode=en&amp;ns=1 |title=Political doctrine (definition) |publisher=Eionet.europa.eu |date=2012-07-20 |accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term political doctrine is sometimes wrongly identified with political ideology. However, doctrine lacks ''the actional aspect'' of ideology. It is mainly a theoretical discourse, which "refers to a coherent sum of assertions regarding what a particular topic should be" (Bernard Crick). Political doctrine is based on a rationally elaborated set of values, which may precede the formation of a political identity ''per se''. It is concerned with philosophical orientations on a ''meta-theoretical'' level.&lt;ref name="sferapoliticii"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/169/art09-Sandru.php | title=Ideology, Between the Concept and the Political Reality | publisher=Sfera Politicii nr. 169 | work=The Knowledge Based Society Project | accessdate=March 10, 2013 | author=Dr. Daniel Șandru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal usage==
A [[legal doctrine]] is a body of inter-related rules (usually of [[common law]] and built over a long period of time) associated with a legal concept or principle. For example, the doctrine of [[frustration of purpose]] now has many tests and rules applicable with regards to each other and can be contained within a "bubble" of ''frustration''. In a court session a defendant may refer to the doctrine of justification.

It can be seen that a branch of law contains various doctrines, which in turn contain various ''rules'' or ''tests''. The test of ''non-occurrence of crucial event'' is part of the doctrine of ''frustration'' which is part of [[contract|contract law]]. Doctrines can grow into a branch of [[law]]; [[restitution]] is now considered a branch of [[law]] separate to [[contract]] and [[tort]].

{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}}
The bibliographical definition of an '''edition''' includes all copies of a [[book]] printed “from substantially the same setting of [[typesetting|type]],” including all minor [[typography|typographical]] variants.

The numbering of book editions is a special case of the wider field of [[revision control]]. The traditional conventions for numbering book editions evolved spontaneously for several centuries before any greater [[applied science]] of revision control became important to humanity, which did not occur until the era of widespread [[computing]] had arrived (when [[software]] and [[electronic publishing]] came into existence). The old and new aspects of book edition numbering (from before and since the advent of computing) are discussed below. 

=={{anchor|first}} First edition &lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt;==

[[File:UncleTomsCabinCover.jpg|thumb|rioght|180px|Title-page illustration by [[Hammatt Billings]] for ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', First Edition: Boston: [[John P. Jewett]] and Company, 1852]]

According to the definition of ''edition'' above, a book printed today, by the same [[publisher]], and from the same type as when it was first published, is still the ''first edition'' of that book to a [[bibliographer]]. However, [[book collector]]s generally use the term ''first edition'' to mean specifically the first [[#Print run|print run]] of the first edition (aka "first edition, first impression"). Since World War II, books often include a number line ([[printer's key]]) that indicates the print run.

A "first edition" per se is not a valuable collectible book. A popular work may be published and reprinted over time by many publishers, and in a variety of formats. There will be a first edition of each, which the publisher may cite on the copyright page, such as: "First mass market paperback edition". The first edition of a facsimile reprint is the reprint publisher's first edition, but not the first edition of the work itself.

The Independent Online Booksellers Association has a [http://www.ioba.org/pages/resources/first-edition-primer/ A First Edition Primer ] which discusses several aspects of identifying first editions including publishing and specific publishers way of designating first editions.

===Bibliographical definition===
The classic explanation of edition was given by [[Fredson Bowers]] in ''Principles of Bibliographical Description'' (1949). Bowers wrote that an edition is “the whole number of copies printed at any time or times from substantially the same setting of type-pages,” including “all issues and variant states existing within its basic type-setting, as well as all impressions.”

Publishers often use the same typesetting for the [[hardcover]] and [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] versions of a book. These books have different covers, the [[title page]] and copyright page may differ, and the page margin sizes may differ (same ''type area'', smaller ''trim''), but to a bibliographer they are the same edition.

From time to time, readers may observe an error in the text (or, in the days of metal type, a piece of broken type), and report these to the publisher. The publisher typically keeps these "reprint corrections" in a file pending demand for a new print run of the edition, and before the new run is printed, they will be entered.

The method of entry, obviously, depends on the method of typesetting. For [[Letterpress printing|letterpress metal]], it typically meant resetting a few characters or a line or two. For [[Linotype machine|linotype]], it meant casting a new line for any line with a change in it. With film, it involved cutting out a bit of the film and inserting a new bit. In an electronic file, it means entering the changes digitally.

Such minor changes do not constitute a new edition, but introduce typographical variations within an edition, which are of interest to collectors.

===Collectors' definition===
[[File:Tristram Shandy First edition spines.jpg|thumb|First editions of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]] ]]
A common complaint of book collectors is that the bibliographer's definition is used in a book-collecting context. For example, [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' {{asof|2016|lc=y}} remains in print in hardcover. The type is the same as the 1951 first printing, therefore all hardcover copies are, for the bibliographer, the first edition. Collectors would use the term for the first printing only.

First edition most often refers to the first commercial publication of a work between its own covers, even if it was first printed in a periodical: the complete text of [[Ernest Hemingway]]’s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' appeared in the September 1, 1952 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', yet the generally accepted “first” edition is the hardcover book [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]’s published on September 8, 1952.

The term "first trade edition," refers to the earliest edition of a book offered for sale to the general public in book stores. For example, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' was published in two variant forms. A "Sustainers' Edition", published by the Jungle Publishing Company, was sent to subscribers who had advanced funds to Sinclair. The first trade edition was published by [[Doubleday, Page]] to be sold in bookstores.

Many book collectors place maximum value on the earliest bound copies of a book—promotional [[advance copy|advance copies]], bound galleys, uncorrected proofs, and advance reading copies sent by publishers to book reviewers and [[bookstore|booksellers]]. It is true that these are rarer than the production copies; but given that these were not printed from a different setting of type (just the opposite; the main purpose of galleys and proofs is to double-check the typeset matter that will be used for production), they are not different editions.

===Publishers' definitions===
Publishers use "first edition" according to their own purposes, and consequently among them the designation is used very inconsistently. The "first edition" of a trade book may be the first iteration of the work printed by the publisher in question or the first iteration of the work that includes a specific set of illustrations or editorial commentary.

Publishers of non-fiction, academic works, and [[textbook]]s generally distinguish between revisions of the text of the work, by typically citing the dates of the first and latest editions of the work in the copyright page. Exceptions to this [[rule of thumb]] include denominating as a "second edition" a new textbook that has a different format, title, and/or author(s) because a previous textbook that shares only the same subject matter as the "second edition" is considered the first edition. The reason for this stretch of the definition is often for the short-term marketing advantage of the new textbook, because, although first editions are often considered more valuable than later editions to book collectors, being a subsequent edition of a previous textbook gives the impression that the textbook denominated as a subsequent edition is more authoritative.

==Other types of editions==

=== Revised edition ===
Publishers sometimes denominate a new iteration of a work a "revised edition" or the "(N)th edition, revised" when the previous iteration has been editorially revised or updated yet the author or publisher does not want to denominate it the "(N+1)th edition" ("N" being the number of the previous edition) for some subjective reason. Conversely, a new iteration of a work that is not substantially different may be denominated a "new edition" or the "(N+1)th edition".

The qualitative difference between a "revised edition" and a "new edition" is subjective. This is analogous to the way that software publishers may denominate an iteration "version 3.7" and the subsequent updated iteration "version 4" instead of "version 3.8". The subjective judgment of the ''degree'' of [[Software versioning#Change significance|the significance of the change]] made with the new iteration or the perceived marketing advantage of designating the new iteration as a specific number determines how the new iteration is numbered.

Therefore, the designation "revised edition" does not designate any quality or quantity of revision with certainty.

===Revised and updated edition===
When a non-fiction book is first published it sometimes instigates more research on its subject. The author may determine that new information justifies the revision of the book. A new iteration of the book would be published as a new edition, which may be denominated a "revised and updated edition". However, as with the denomination of "revised edition", the use of "revised and updated edition" manifests only the subjective choice of the publisher, which may be different from the publisher of a previous "revised edition" of the same work.

=== Co-edition &lt;!-- Section linked from Horus Heresy (novels) --&gt; ===
The basic definition of a ''co-edition'' is when two publishing houses publish the same edition of a book (or equivalent versions of an edition, for example, translated versions), simultaneously or near-simultaneously, usually in different countries. English and American editions may [[American and British English spelling differences|differ in spelling]], and they [[list of works with different titles in the United Kingdom and United States|sometimes have different titles]]. Some examples:
* An English-language edition, from the same plates, films, or files, may be published in different anglophone countries by different publishing companies. For example, Arms &amp; Armour Press in the UK and Stackpole Books in the U.S. published co-editions of various monographs on military matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leventhal|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A French-language novel published in France this year by a French publisher could become an English-language translation published in the U.S. next year by a U.S. publisher.

The logic of co-editions has often been to use the existing distribution systems of the different publishers in each country rather than establishing new distribution systems.

Advancing [[Information technology|IT]] and the globalization of publishing have been blurring the lines of what ''co-edition'' means. For example, anything published online is effectively published worldwide. Also, large multinational publishers now have existing distribution systems for their hardcopy books in many countries, so they don't need to partner with other companies. They may issue a book under a different imprint for each country, but the imprints are parts of the same parent corporation. The actual manufacturing of the books may be done in China regardless of where the copies will be sold.

=== e-dition ===
The term ''e-dition'', a play on the [[Internet-related prefixes#"E-"|''e-''for-electronic prefix]], has been used by various publishers to refer to various ideas, which include:
* The hardcopy book's content posted online, fully searchable
* Supplemental online-only content for buyers of the hardcopy book
* Online-only publishing (no hardcopy distribution)
* Proprietary-format digital publication ([[e-book]]s) for use in specialized hardware for reading the book ([[e-book reader]]s)

===Library edition===
A library edition may appear to be the same as copies appearing in shops and almost certainly uses the same setting. However, the binding and hinges are made extra strong to allow for the greater wear and tear in library books. This is analogous to the "police and taxi" packages for automobiles, in which heavier brakes and other upgrades are made to withstand harsher-than-standard use and longer [[duty cycle]]s.

===Book club edition===
A popular book is sometimes re-issued under the imprint of a [[Book sales club|book club]]. Often it is a new setting and with cheaper paper and binding. Any photographic illustrations in the original are either absent or reduced in number. Book club editions are sold to members at a good discount compared with the original issue price.

===Cheap edition===
After a book has exhausted the market at the high original price a publisher may issue a cheap edition themselves or sell the rights on to another publisher who will produce the book. A cheap edition typically uses a low-cost paper and is a paperback but they can be hardback. Also typically the size of the font is reduced to fit more words on a page to reduce the overall cost of the book. Naturally, for a cheap edition the author will receive a lower royalty but that may be compensated for by a greater volume of sales.

===Colonial edition===

During the peak of the [[British Empire]], cheap editions of novels published in Britain would often be produced for sale in the colonies before other editions of the books were sold. The rationale was that books took a long time to export to the colonies, that readership in those settlements was avid, and that books were an effective means to disseminate British values. Australia was by far the largest consumer of colonial editions. [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] (London) published the largest number of colonial edition titles. They began in 1843 and persisted (in terms of pricing and trade) until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Johanson, ''A study of colonial editions in Australia, 1843-1972''. Elibank Press, Wellington, New Zealand. {{ISBN|0958349630}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cadet edition===
A cadet edition is a cut down version of a book which is more simply written. It is intended for young readers rather than adults.

===Large print edition===
These editions are typically library editions but the font size of the text is much larger than usual so that persons with poor eyesight (often older persons) can more easily read the book. The [[large print]] books tend to be of a uniform size.

===Critical edition===
A critical edition is a scholarly publication, containing commentary, critique, and sometimes a full developmental history of the work from all available sources.

== Printing, print run, impression, et cetera ==
&lt;!-- This heading is the target of multiple anchor-linked redirects: [[Print run]], [[Printing run]], [[Impression (book)]], [[Impression (books)]], [[Impression (publishing)]], and [[Press run]]. --&gt;
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Krishnamurti's Notebook#Publication history]] [[The First and Last Freedom#Publication history]] ([[MOS:HEAD]]).--&gt;
A batch of identical copies of an iteration/edition of a work that is printed in the same, single execution of the production set-up is denominated a "print run", "printing run", "printing", "impression", or "press run" according to the subjective choice of the publisher. All these denominations denote the action of applying pressure to paper in order to produce the book, and therefore are interchangeable. One edition of a work may have any number of printings, e. g. first edition, first impression; first edition, second impression; and second edition, first impression. Books that sell poorly may have only one. Very successful books may have 50 or more. If present, the [[printer's key]] in the copyright page of a book can be used to identify the number of the printing in which it was produced. In [[printmaking]], however, an "impression" only denotes an individual copy of a specific printing of the work.

A publisher hopes to recoup a large amount of the initial costs of publishing a book from the sale of the copies/impressions produced in the first printing of the book. A variety of commercial and logistic factors are thus considered in deciding the number of books to be produced in a specific printing and their individual price.

Demand for additional printings after the first is always hoped for, because they increase a book's profitability. Once the [[fixed costs]] of developing, editing, typesetting, etc. have been covered by the revenue of the first sales, any additional revenue tends to add to the profit margin, minus, of course, the costs of the additional materials, printing, binding, and distribution.

Sometimes a printing will be unsatisfactory for various reasons, especially printings of artistic and photography books in which the quality of reproduction is paramount. A defective printing is usually destroyed by being [[Pulping|pulped]], yet occasionally a defective printing is shipped to a distant overseas market and there sold cheaply, contingent on the costs of shipping.

If sales of a book do not meet expectations, the remaining stock of a printing will be [[Remaindered book|remaindered]]. When all copies/impressions of a printing are sold, the book is either [[reprint]]ed or becomes [[out of print]]. Some [[print on demand]] and [[e-book]] publishers keep all their books perpetually "in print".

A "second" is an imperfect or damaged copy/impression which is set aside from the other copies/impressions of a printing. These will usually have their [[dust jacket]] clipped or marked in some way to designate their inferiority.

Sometimes readers may observe an error in the text of a book and report it to the publisher. The publisher usually records these '''reprint corrections''' in a file pending demand for a new printing, before which they are incorporated into the revised text. This is one of the factors that inserts the "substantially" into the definition of "substantially the same setting of type".

== Republication == &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Republication]] redirects here. --&gt;
Many commercially successful books have been republished, either by their original or other imprints. For this reason if a popular book is searched for in a large bookseller such as [[Amazon.com]] or a large library catalog such as WorldCat, often an array of different copyright years, publishers, editions, formats (hardcover, softcover, trade, and mass market), and so forth are observed. Because no universal authority or convention determines the exact distinction between a "reprinting" and "republishing" and whether a republishing is a different "edition", the denotation of such denominations is ambiguous, at least at first glance.

==Legal status==

===UK===
Since 1956, typographical arrangements of published editions are protected by copyright law. ''[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]'' defines a published edition to mean ''a published edition of the whole or any part of one or more literary, dramatic or musical works''.{{efn|Duration [[Directive (European Union)|Directive of the EU]] permits member states to create a publishers' right in critical and scientific works which have fallen into the [[public domain]].}}

It thus protects the publisher's investment in typesetting, as well as the processes of design and selection that are reflected in the appearance of the text.{{efn|See ''[[Newspaper Licensing Agency]] v. [[Marks &amp; Spencer]]'' [2000].}} It also covers modern editions of public domain works (such as the complete works of Shakespeare), and prohibits the reproduction of the layout (but not the work itself).

'''Environmental vegetarianism''' is the practice of [[vegetarianism]] or eating a [[plant-based diet]] based on the indications that animal-based industries are environmentally destructive or [[sustainable development|unsustainable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/weekinreview/27bittman.html|title=Rethinking the Meat-Guzzler|first=Mark|last=Bittman|date=27 January 2008|access-date=8 November 2017|publisher=The New York Times|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary environmental concerns with animal products are [[pollution]]—including [[greenhouse gas]] emissions (GHG)—[[deforestation]], and the use of resources such as [[fossil fuel]]s, [[Water crisis|water]], and land.

==Environmental impact of animal products==
{{Main article|Environmental impact of meat production}}[[File:Sources of dietary energy-consumtion (%) 2001-2003 (FAO).svg|thumb|400px|right|According to an [[FAO]] report, the predicted increase in [[animal product]] consumption by people living in [[Developing country|developing countries]] will bring new challenges to global [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/documents/pdf/sources_of_dietary_energy_consumption.pdf|title=FAOSTAT|website=faostat.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Four-fifths of agricultural emissions arise from the livestock sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673609617530 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0 | volume=374 | issue=9706 | title=Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture | journal=The Lancet | pages=2016–2025 | year=2009 | last1 = Friel | first1 = Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributable to animal products range from 18% to 51% of total global emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/study-claims-meat-creates-half-of-all-greenhouse-gases-1812909.html|title=Study claims meat creates half of all greenhouse gases|date=1 November 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a PNAS model showed that even if animals were completely removed from U.S. agriculture and diets, U.S. GHG emissions would be decreased by 2.6% only (or 28% of agricultural GHG emissions). This is because of the need replace animal manures by fertilizers and to replace also other animal coproducts, and because livestock now use human-inedible food and fiber processing byproducts. Moreover, people would suffer from a greater number of deficiencies in essential nutrients although they would get a greater excess of energy, possibly leading to greater obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/E10301.full|title=Nutritional and greenhouse gas impacts of removing animals from US agriculture|date=November 13, 2017|volume=114|issue=48|doi=10.1073/pnas.1707322114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=E10301–E10308 | last1 = White | first1 = Robin R. | last2 = Beth Hall | first2 = Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study published in the journal ''[[Carbon Balance and Management]]'' found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates based on data from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wolf|first1=Julie|last2=Asrar |first2=Ghassem R. |last3= West|first3=Tristram O.|date=September 29, 2017 |title=Revised methane emissions factors and spatially distributed annual carbon fluxes for global livestock|url=https://cbmjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y|journal=[[Carbon Balance and Management]]|volume=12 |issue=16 |pages= |doi=10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y|access-date=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in ''Climate Change'' concluded "if ... average diets among UK adults conformed to WHO recommendations, their associated GHG emissions would be reduced by 17 %. Further GHG emission reductions of around 40% could be achieved by making realistic modifications to diets so that they contain fewer animal products and processed snacks and more fruit, vegetables and cereals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1329-y#/page-1 | doi=10.1007/s10584-015-1329-y | volume=129 | title=The potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the UK through healthy and realistic dietary change | journal=Climatic Change | pages=253–265 | year=2015 | last1 = Green | first1 = Rosemary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2006 [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) report ''[[Livestock's Long Shadow]]'', animal agriculture contributes on a "massive scale" to [[global warming]], air pollution, [[land degradation]], energy use, [[deforestation]], and [[biodiversity]] decline.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;{{Citation |last= Steinfeld|first= Henning|last2= Gerber|first2= Pierre|last3= Wassenaar|first3= Tom|last4= Castel|first4= Vincent|last5= Rosales|first5= Mauricio|last6= de Haan|first6= Cees|year= 2006|title= Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options|publisher= FAO|publication-place= Rome|page= |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/climatechange/doc/FAO%20report%20executive%20summary.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAO report estimates that the [[livestock]] (including poultry) sector (which provides draft animal power, leather, wool, milk, eggs, fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, etc., in addition to meat) contributes about 18 percent of global GHG emissions expressed as 100-year [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] equivalents. This estimate was based on [[life-cycle analysis]], including feed production, land use changes, etc., and used GWP ([[global warming potential]]) of  23 for methane and 296 for nitrous oxide, to convert emissions of these gases to 100-year CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. The FAO report concluded that "the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global".&lt;ref name=FAO /&gt;

Some sources{{Citation needed|reason=Which sources?|date=May 2016}} disagree with some of the figures used in arriving at the FAO estimate of 18 percent. For example, the FAO report estimates that 37 percent of global anthropogenic [[methane emissions]] are attributable to the livestock sector, and a [[NASA]] summary indicates about 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Augenbraun, H.|author2=E.

The estimated energy use in agricultural production includes embodied energy in purchased inputs.&lt;ref&gt;Canning, P., A. Charles, S. Huang, K. R.

A 2010 report from the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]'s (UNEP) International Panel of Sustainable Resource Management stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Impacts from agriculture are expected to increase substantially due to population growth and increasing consumption of animal products. Unlike fossil fuels, it is difficult to look for alternatives: people have to eat. A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial worldwide diet change, away from animal products.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year= 2010|title= Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production: Priority Products and Materials|publisher= UNEP|publication-place= |page= 82|url=http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Portals/24102/PDFs/PriorityProductsAndMaterials_Report.pdf |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-un"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Cornell University]] scientists: "The heavy dependence on fossil energy suggests that the US food system, whether meat-based or plant-based, is not sustainable".&lt;ref name=PimentelPimentel2003/&gt; However, they also write: "The meat-based food system requires more energy, land, and water resources than the lactoovovegetarian diet.

He "depicted grain-fed livestock farming as a costly and nonsustainable way to produce animal protein", but "distinguished grain-fed meat production from pasture-raised livestock, calling cattle-grazing a more reasonable use of marginal land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= August 7, 1997|title= U.S. could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat, Cornell ecologist advises animal scientists|url= http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat|newspaper= [[Cornell Chronicle]]|location= |access-date= 19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2002 paper:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The industrial agriculture system consumes fossil fuel, water, and topsoil at unsustainable rates. It contributes to numerous forms of environmental degradation, including air and water pollution, soil depletion, diminishing biodiversity, and fish die-offs. Meat production contributes disproportionately to these problems, in part because feeding grain to livestock to produce meat—instead of feeding it directly to humans—involves a large energy loss, making animal agriculture more resource intensive than other forms of food production. ... One personal act that can have a profound impact on these issues is reducing [[meat consumption]]. To produce 1 pound of feedlot beef requires about 2,400 gallons of water and 7 pounds of grain (42). Considering that the average American consumes 97 pounds of beef (and 273 pounds of meat in all) each year, even modest reductions in meat consumption in such a culture would substantially reduce the burden on our natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Horrigan|first= Leo|last2= Lawrence|first2= Robert S|last3= Walker|first3= Polly|date= May 2002|title= How Sustainable Agriculture Can Address the Environmental and Human Health Harms of Industrial Agriculture|url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240832/pdf/ehp0110-000445.pdf|journal= [[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|publisher= |volume= 110|issue= 5|pages= 445–456|doi= 10.1289/ehp.02110445|access-date=17 July 2015 |pmc=1240832 |pmid=12003747}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2003 paper published in the [[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]], after calculating effects on energy, land, and water use, concluded that meat-based diets require more resources and are less sustainable than [[lacto-ovo vegetarian]] diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/660S|title=Sustainability of meat-based and plant-based diets and the environment|first1=David|last1=Pimentel|first2=Marcia|last2=Pimentel|date=1 September 2003|publisher=|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=78|issue=3|pages=660S–663S|via=ajcn.nutrition.org|pmid=12936963|doi=10.1093/ajcn/78.3.660s}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The water required for a meat-eating diet is twice as much needed for a 2,000-litre-a-day vegetarian diet".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.watereducation.org/aquafornia-news/solution-worlds-water-woes-rising-populations-and-growing-demand-making-world|title=Solution for the world's water woes: Rising populations and growing demand is making the world a thirsty planet; the solution lies in people reducing the size of their "water footprints" - Water Education Foundation|website=www.watereducation.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The environmental impacts of animal production vary with the method of production. A grazing-based production can limit soil erosion and also allow farmers to control pests with less pesticides by rotating crops with grass. However, in arid areas, this may catalyze a [[desertification]] process. The ability of soil to absorb water by infiltration is important for minimizing runoff and soil erosion. Researchers in Iowa reported that a soil under perennial pasture grasses grazed by livestock was able to absorb far more water than the same kind of soil under two annual crops: corn and soybeans.&lt;ref&gt;Bharati et al. 2002. Agroforestry Systems 56: 249-257&lt;/ref&gt; Corn and soybean crops commonly provide food for human consumption, biofuels, livestock feed, or some combination of these.

Animal production has a large impact on water pollution and usage. According to the Water Education Foundation, it takes 2,464 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef in California, whereas it takes only 25 gallons of water to produce one pound of wheat. Raising a large amount of livestock creatives a massive amount of manure and urine, which can pollute natural resources by changing the pH of water, contaminates the air, and emits a major amount of gas that directly affects global warming. As most livestock are raised in small confined spaces to cut down on cost, this increases the problem of concentrated waste. Livestock in the United States produces 2.7 trillion pounds of manure each year,  which is ten times more than what is produced by the entire U.S. population. There are issues with how animal waste is disposed, as some is used as fertilizer while some farmers create manure lagoons which store millions of gallons of animal waste which is extremely unsafe and detrimental to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vegetariantimes.com/article/the-environmental-impact-of-a-meat-based-diet|title=The Environmental Impact of a Meat-Based Diet|last=admin|date=2007-04-04|work=Vegetarian Times|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental vegetarianism can be compared with [[economic vegetarianism]]. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism either out of necessity or because of a conscious [[simple living]] strategy. Such a person may base this belief on a philosophical viewpoint, such as the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound or that vegetarianism will help improve public health, lead to global food security, and curb [[starvation]].&lt;ref name="The Startling Effects of Going Vegetarian for Just One Day"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Startling Effects of Going Vegetarian for Just One Day|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/134650/the_startling_effects_of_going_vegetarian_for_just_one_day|accessdate=10 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007180810/http://www.alternet.org/story/134650/the_startling_effects_of_going_vegetarian_for_just_one_day|archivedate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eat Better and Improve Your Health For Less Money"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eat Better and Improve Your Health For Less Money|url=http://www.savvyvegetarian.com/blog/health/economic-advantages-vegetarian-diet|accessdate=10 February 2013|author=Katherine Manning|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114192717/http://www.savvyvegetarian.com/blog/health/economic-advantages-vegetarian-diet|archivedate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental vegetarians call for a reduction of first world consumption of meat, especially in the US. According to the [[United Nations Population Fund]], "Each U.S. citizen consumes an average of 260 lbs. of meat per year, the world's highest rate. That is about 1.5 times the industrial world average, three times the East Asian average, and 40 times the average in Bangladesh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/6billion/ccmc/u.s.scorecard.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030428144241/http://www.unfpa.org/6billion/ccmc/u.s.scorecard.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-04-28|title=UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "the [[ecological footprint]] of an average person in a high-income country is about six times bigger than that of someone in a low-income country, and many more times bigger than in the least-developed countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2004/english/ch3/|title=State of World Population 2004 - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=October 2011}} argue that the adoption of an [[ovo-lacto vegetarian]] or entirely plant-based vegan diet is best, but may not be totally necessary, because even modest reductions in meat consumption in industrialized societies would substantially reduce the burden on natural resources. For developed countries, a CAST report estimates an average of 2.6 pounds of grain feed per pound of beef carcass meat produced. For developing countries, the estimate is 0.3 pounds per pound. (Some very dissimilar figures are sometimes seen; the CAST report discusses common sources of error and discrepancies among such figures.)&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, E. et al. 1999. Animal Agriculture and Global Food Supply. Council on Agricultural Science and Technology. 92 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, US per capita beef consumption was 62.2 pounds per year, and US per capita meat (red meat plus fish plus poultry) consumption totaled 200.7 pounds (boneless trimmed weight basis).&lt;ref&gt;USDA.  2010. Agricultural Statistics 2010, Table 13-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
[[Bill Mollison]] has argued in his Permaculture Design Course that vegetarianism exacerbates soil erosion. This is because removing a plant from a field removes all the nutrients it obtained from the soil, while removing an animal leaves the field intact. On US farmland, much less soil erosion is associated with pastureland used for livestock grazing than with land used for production of crops.&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. 2009. Summary report 2007 national resources inventory. USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. 123 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Hart (horticulturist)|Robert Hart]] has also developed [[forest gardening]], which has since been adopted as a common permaculture design element, as a sustainable plant-based food production system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Gardening|author=Robert Hart|year=1996|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N01940btQAQC&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=forest%20gardening%20robert%20hart%20simple%20living&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some environmental activists claim that adopting a vegetarian diet may be a way of focusing on personal actions and righteous gestures rather than systemic change. [[Environmentalist]] Dave Riley states that "being meatless and guiltless seems seductively simple while environmental destruction rages around us", and notes that Mollison "insists that vegetarianism drives animals from the edible landscape so that their contribution to the food chain is lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/5814|title= Does meat make the meal?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others assert that "the vegan diet wastes available land that could otherwise be used to feed more people", but still conclude that a dairy-friendly vegetarian diet is the most sustainable when compared to 9 other diets, some more influenced by vegetarianism than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/749443/being-vegan-isnt-as-environmentally-friendly-as-you-think/|title=Being vegan isn’t as good for humanity as you think|first=Chase|last=Purdy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eric Schechter''' (born August 1, 1950) is an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]], retired from [[Vanderbilt University]] with the title of professor emeritus.  His interests started primarily in analysis but moved into mathematical logic. Schechter is best known for his 1996 book ''Handbook of Analysis and its Foundations'', which provides a novel approach to mathematical analysis and related topics at the graduate level.

== Important works ==

Schechter has authored a number of articles in [[analysis]], [[differential equations]], [[mathematical logic]], and [[set theory]].  He is best known for writing two textbooks covering advanced material but written at an introductory level:

* (2005) ''Classical and Nonclassical Logics'' ({{isbn|0-691-12279-2}}) [http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~schectex/logics/ (more information)]
* (1996) ''Handbook of Analysis and its Foundations'' ({{isbn|0126227608}}) [http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~schectex/ccc/ (more information)]

''Handbook of Analysis and its Foundations'' was reviewed at length by the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] review, which wrote:
:''Every once in a while a book comes along that so effectively redefines an educational enterprise -- in this case, graduate mathematical training -- and so effectively reexamines the hegemony of ideas prevailing in a discipline -- in this case, mathematical analysis -- that it deserves our careful attention. This is such a book.''.&lt;ref name="siam"&gt;[http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~schectex/ccc/siamrev/], S.I.A.M. Review, Volume 40, Number 2, pp. 421-426.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schechter also maintains two webpages that are frequently cited:

==Politics==

Schechter is involved in political activism of the [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] variety.  His mathematical homepage includes a few anti-war statements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~schectex/ Eric Schechter's Mathematical Home Page, Accessed Apr. 16, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; and his political home page includes a long essay about progressive ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myspace.com/nonclassical Eric Schechter's Political Home Page, Accessed June 6, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked as an organizer for the Nashville Peace Coalition, protesting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidevandy.com/drupal/node/13253 "Students, others to protest war outside Petraeus presentation", ''The Vanderbilt Hustler'', Mar. 1, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting for the [[Living wage]] movement on Vanderbilt's campus, he remarked that it is hard to bring up politics in a non-political environment, and expressed that people did not talk much about politics in the mathematics department at Vanderbilt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidevandy.com/drupal/node/2674 Allison Malone, "NEWS: LIVE enlists support of Greeks, student government and faculty to bolster campaign", Jan. 25, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, Henry Schechter, was a deputy of the [[AFL-CIO]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/21/AR2005072102207.html "Obituaries: AFL-CIO Deputy Henry Schechter", ''Washington Post'', July 22, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Schechter ran for Tennessee's 5th Congressional District seat against incumbent congressman Jim Cooper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=117654 "Political discord inspires hundreds to enter TN races", ''The Tennessean '', Apr. 2, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; but was defeated in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] primary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5567">'''Ernst Kolman''' or '''Arnošt Yaromirovich Kolman''' ({{lang-ru|Арношт Яромирович Кольман)}}; 6 December 1892 – 22 January 1979) was a Marxist philosopher, notable for his activities as chief ideological watchdog in Soviet science.

== Biography ==
He was born in Prague to a Jewish family and studied at [[Charles University]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

During [[World War I]] he fought in the Austro-Hungarian army and was taken prisoner by the Russian forces. After the Russian revolution he joined the Bolshevik party and worked as a party functionary in the Red Army and the Communist International.

In 1923 Kolman was assigned to the party apparatus in Moscow, where he quickly assumed the role of ideological watchdog in scientific community. He became deputy head of the Moscow party Science Department in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taubman |first=William |authorlink=William Taubman |coauthors= |title=Khrushchev: The Man and His Era|titlelink=Khrushchev: The Man and His Era |year=2003 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton]] |location= | pages= |isbn=0-393-05144-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 [[Dmitri Egorov]], the president of [[Moscow Mathematical Society]]  was arrested by Soviet secret police. Under threat of the society's closure, Ernst Kolman was elected its new president, a position he held from 1930 to 1932.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Prof. Ernst Kolman, A Confidant of Lenin, Dies in Sweden at 85. |url= |quote=([[Reuters]]) Prof. Ernst Kolman, confidant of Lenin and pupil of Einstein, has died in a Stockholm suburb at the age of 85. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 26, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1931, Kolman attended the Second International Congress of the History of Science and Technology with a group of Soviet scientists led by Bukharin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/mathematical-manuscripts/review.htm Marx’s brilliant study of mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;

He attacked a number of prominent Soviet mathematicians and physicists, accusing them of [[Wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]] and different political crimes. Kolman initiated the so-called "Academician Luzin case". In July–August 1936, [[Nikolai Luzin]] was criticised in ''[[Pravda]]'' in a series of anonymous articles, whose authorship later was attributed to Kolman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levin |first= A. E. |title=Anatomy of a public campaign: "Academician Luzin`s case" in Soviet political history. |journal=Slavic Review |volume=49|issue=1 |year=1990 |month= |pages=90–108 |doi=10.2307/2500418 |jstor=2500418 |publisher=Slavic Review, Vol. 49, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luzin was accused of publishing his works in foreign scientific journals and denounced for being close to the  “slightly modernized ideology of the [[Black Hundreds|black hundreds]], orthodoxy, and [[monarchy]].”

After [[World War II]] Kolman was sent to [[Czechoslovakia]], where he worked as a head of the propaganda department of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] Central Committee. He helped to establish communist party control over the Czekhoslovak scientific community. At the 10th [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in Amsterdam Kolman attacked all non-Marxist philosophies as "fascist and imperialist."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,799074-1,00.html IDEOLOGIES: The Consolations of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 Kolman criticized [[Rudolf Slánský]] and [[Klement Gottwald]]. He was summoned back to USSR and spent three years at the [[Lubianka prison]], until Stalin's death.

He returned to [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1958–1963, and then lived in Moscow, where he became increasingly disaffected with Soviet communism.

Kolman authored several books on [[dialectical materialism]] and [[historical materialism]].

==Defection==
In 1976 he applied for political asylum in Sweden, making him the oldest asylum seeker from the Soviet Union at the time at 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krasnov|first=Vladislav|title=Soviet Defectors: The KGB Wanted List|publisher=Hoover Institution, Stanford University|location=Stanford|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; He terminated his 58-year membership of the USSR communist party on September 22, 1976, in an open letter addressed to party general secretary [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. On 9 December 1976, the Czechoslovak government revoked his membership of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. He died on 22 January 1979 in Stockholm.

'''Frisking''' (also called a '''patdown''' or '''pat down''') is a search of a person's outer clothing wherein a person runs his or her hands along the outer garments to detect any [[concealed weapon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

==U.S. Law==
In the United States, a [[law enforcement officer]] may briefly detain a person upon [[reasonable suspicion]] of involvement in a crime but short of [[probable cause]] to arrest; such a detention is known as a [[Terry stop|''Terry'' stop]].&lt;ref&gt;
Writing for the Court in ''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'', [[Thurgood Marshall|Justice Marshall]] stated
:the usual traffic stop is more analogous to a so-called "''Terry'' stop," see ''Terry v. Ohio'', 392 U.S. 1 (1968) (468 U.S. at 439)
&lt;/ref&gt;  When a search for weapons is also authorized, the procedure is known as a '''stop and frisk'''. To justify the stop, a law enforcement officer must be able to point to "specific and articulable facts"
that would indicate to a reasonable person that a crime has been, is being, or is about to be committed.&lt;ref&gt;
In ''Terry v. Ohio'', Chief Justice Warren stated
:And in justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion. (392 U.S. at 21)
&lt;/ref&gt; 

If the officer reasonably suspects that the suspect is in possession of a weapon that is of danger to the officer or others, the officer may conduct a frisking of the suspect's outer garments to search for weapons. The search must be limited to what is necessary to discover weapons;&lt;ref&gt;
In ''Terry v. Ohio'', Chief Justice Warren stated

:Thus it must be limited to that which is necessary for the discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officer or others nearby, and may realistically be characterized as something less than a "full" search, even though it remains a serious intrusion. (392 U.S. at 26)
Chief Justice Warren continued:

:The sole justification of the search in the present situation is the protection of the police officer and others nearby, and it must therefore be confined in scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer. (392 U.S. at 29)
&lt;/ref&gt;
however, pursuant to the [[Plain view doctrine|"plain feel" doctrine]], police may seize [[contraband]] discovered in the course of a frisk, but only if the contraband's identity is immediately apparent.&lt;ref&gt;
Writing for the Court in ''[[Minnesota v. Dickerson]]'', [[Byron White|Justice White]] stated

:If a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect's outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect's privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer's search for weapons; if the object is contraband, its warrantless seizure would be justified by the same practical considerations that inhere in the plain-view context. (508 U.S. at 375–376)

Justice White continued:

:Here, the officer's continued exploration of respondent's pocket after having concluded that it contained no weapon was unrelated to "[t]he sole justification of the search [under ''Terry:''] {{nowrap|. . .}} the protection of the police officer and others nearby." 392 U.S., at 29. It therefore amounted to the sort of evidentiary search that ''Terry'' expressly refused to authorize, see id., at 26, and that we have condemned in subsequent cases. (508 U.S. at 378)
&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York City program===
{{main|Stop-and-frisk in New York City}}
The [[New York City Police Department]] has come under scrutiny for its use of the ''Terry'' stop. Supporters say that it reduces crime, but civil rights advocates say it is racial profiling.  John A. Eterno, a former city police captain describes: "My take is that this has become more like a 'throw a wide net and see what you can find' kind of thing.  I don't see it as targeted enforcement, especially when you see numbers that we are talking about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Al|title=New York Minorities More Likely to Be Frisked|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/nyregion/13frisk.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=16 March 2011|date=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Looking at "eight odd blocks of [[Brownsville, Brooklyn]], a study found that between January 2006 and March 2010, the police made nearly 52,000 stops."&lt;ref&gt;Rivera, Ray, Al Baker and Janet Roberts, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/nyregion/12frisk.html “A Few Blocks, 4 Years, 52,000 Police Stops”], ''The New York Times'', July 11, 2010. According to an analysis of data provided by the [[New York City Police Department|Police Department]] and two organizations, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] and the [[New York Civil Liberties Union]]. Retrieved 2011-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later review of that article about NYC's "Stop, Question, and Frisk" program, as well as the larger issue of blacks' welcome in the city, a columnist wrote "there were a record 580,000 stop-and-frisks in the city in 2009. Most of those stopped (55 percent) were black (a large portion were also Hispanic), most were young and almost all were male. For reference, according to the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]], there were about only 300,000 black men between the ages of 13 and 34 living in the city that year. 6 percent of the stops resulted in arrests."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles M. Blow|Blow, Charles, M.]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/opinion/19blow.html?hp “Escape From New York”], [[Op-ed]], ''The New York Times'', March 18, 2011 (March 19, 2011 p. A23 NY ed.).

{{Refimprove|date=December 2006}}

'''Gaia philosophy''' (named after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]] of the [[Earth]]) is a broadly inclusive term for related concepts that living organisms on a [[planet]] will affect the nature of their environment in order to make the environment more suitable for [[life]]. This set of [[Gaia hypothesis|theories]] holds that all organisms on a life-giving planet regulate the [[biosphere]] in such a way as to promote its habitability. Gaia concept draws a connection between the survivability of a species (hence its [[evolutionary]] course) and its usefulness to the survival of other species.

While there were a number of precursors to Gaia theory, the first scientific form of this idea was proposed as the [[Gaia hypothesis]] by [[James Lovelock]], a UK chemist, in 1970. The Gaia hypothesis deals with the concept of biological [[homeostasis]], and claims the resident life forms of a host planet coupled with their environment have acted and act like a single, self-regulating system. This system includes the near-surface rocks, the soil, and the atmosphere. Today many scientists consider such ideas to be unsupported by, or at odds with, the available evidence (see [[Gaia hypothesis#Recent criticism|recent criticism]]). These theories are however significant in [[green politics]].

== Predecessors to the Gaia theory ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gaia hypothesis]] --&gt;
There are some mystical, scientific and religious predecessors to the Gaia philosophy, which had a Gaia-like conceptual basis.  Many religious mythologies had a view of Earth as being a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts (e.g. some Native American religions and various forms of [[shamanism]]).

[[Lewis Thomas]] believed that Earth should be viewed as a single cell; he derived this view from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s view of Earth as a single round organism.

[[Isaac Newton]] wrote of the earth, "Thus this Earth resembles a great animall or rather inanimate vegetable, draws in [[Aether (classical element)|æthereall]] breath for its dayly refreshment &amp; vitall ferment &amp; transpires again with gross exhalations, And according to the condition of all other things living ought to have its times of beginning youth old age &amp; perishing."&lt;ref&gt;Of Natures obvious laws &amp; processes in vegetation, [http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/mss/norm/ALCH00081 Dibner MS 1031]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a [[paleontologist]] and [[geologist]], believed that evolution unfolded from cell to organism to planet to solar system and ultimately the whole universe, as we humans see it from our limited perspective.  Teilhard later influenced [[Thomas Berry]] and many Catholic humanist thinkers of the 20th century.

[[Buckminster Fuller]] is generally credited with making the idea respectable in Western scientific circles in the 20th century.  Building to some degree on his observations and artifacts, e.g. the [[Dymaxion map]] of the Earth he created, others began to ask if there was a way to make the Gaia theory scientifically sound.

[[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]] in 1970 in an article in ''[[Green Egg]]'' Magazine, independently articulated the Gaia Thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://original.caw.org/articles/theagenesis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617000211/http://original.caw.org/articles/theagenesis.html |archivedate=2010-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these ideas are considered scientific hypotheses; by definition a scientific hypothesis must make testable predictions.  As the above claims are not testable, they are outside the bounds of current science.

These are conjectures and perhaps can only be considered as social and maybe political philosophy; they may have implications for [[theology]], or ''[[thealogy]]'' as Zell-Ravenheart and [[Isaac Bonewits]] put it.

== Range of views ==

According to [[James Kirchner]] there is a spectrum of Gaia hypotheses, ranging from the undeniable to radical. At one end is the undeniable statement that the organisms on the Earth have radically altered its composition. A stronger position is that the Earth's biosphere effectively acts as if it is a self-organizing system which works in such a way as to keep its systems in some kind of equilibrium that is conducive to life.  Today many scientists consider that such a view (and any stronger views) are unlikely to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waltham |first=David |authorlink=David Waltham |date=2014|title=Lucky Planet: Why Earth is Exceptional – and What that Means for Life in the Universe |url=http://www.iconbooks.com/blog/title/lucky-planet/ |location= |publisher=Icon Books |page= |isbn=9781848316560 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beerling |first=David |authorlink=David Beerling|date=2007 |title=The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780192806024.do |location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page= |isbn= 978-0-19-280602-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cockell |last2=Corfield |first2=Richard |last3=Dise |first3= Nancy  |last4=Edwards |first4=Neil  |last5=Harris |first5=Nigel  |date=2008 |title= An Introduction to the Earth-Life System |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/palaeontology-and-life-history/introduction-earth-life-system |location=Cambridge (UK) |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |page= |isbn= 9780521729536 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Tyrrell |first = Toby |title =Gaia: the verdict is… |journal = New Scientist |volume = 220 |pages = 30–31 |date= 26 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(13)62532-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tyrrell209"&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An even stronger claim is that all lifeforms are part of a single planetary being, called Gaia. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas, the terrestrial crust would be the result of interventions carried out by Gaia, through the [[coevolution|coevolving]] diversity of living organisms.

The most extreme form of Gaia theory is that the entire Earth is a single unified organism with a highly intelligent mind that arose as an [[emergent property]] of the whole biosphere. In this view, the Earth's biosphere is ''consciously'' manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence at all to support this last point of view, and it has come about because many people do not understand the concept of [[homeostasis]]. Many non-scientists instinctively and incorrectly see homeostasis as a process that requires conscious control {{dubious|date=October 2014}} {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}.

The more speculative versions of Gaia, including versions in which it is believed that the Earth is actually conscious, sentient, and highly intelligent, are usually considered outside the bounds of what is usually considered science.

== Gaia in biology and science ==
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}

[[Buckminster Fuller]] has been credited as the first to incorporate scientific ideas into a Gaia theory, which he did with his [[Dymaxion map]] of the Earth.

The first scientifically rigorous theory was the [[Gaia hypothesis]] by [[James Lovelock]], a UK chemist.

A variant of this hypothesis was developed by [[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist, in 1979.
Her version is sometimes called the "Gaia Theory" (note uppercase-T). Her model is more limited in scope than the one that Lovelock proposed.

Whether this sort of system is present on Earth is still open to debate. Some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, when [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]] levels rise, plants are able to grow better and thus remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other biological effects and feedbacks exist,&lt;ref name="tyrrell209"/&gt; but the extent to which these mechanisms have stabilized and modified the Earth's overall climate is largely not known.

The Gaia hypothesis is sometimes viewed from significantly different philosophical perspectives. Some environmentalists view it as an almost conscious process, in which the Earth's [[ecosystem]] is literally viewed as a single unified organism. Some evolutionary biologists, on the other hand, view it as an undirected [[emergent property]] of the ecosystem: as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, their combined actions tend to have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Proponents of this view sometimes point to examples of life's actions in the past that have resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a reducing environment to an oxygen-rich one.

Depending on how strongly the case is stated, the hypothesis conflicts with mainstream [[neo-Darwinism]]. Most biologists would accept Daisyworld-style homeostasis as possible, but would certainly not accept the idea that this equates to the whole biosphere acting as one organism.

A very small number of scientists, and a much larger number of environmental activists, claim that Earth's biosphere is ''consciously'' manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence to support this belief.

== Gaia in the social sciences ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

A [[social science]] view of Gaia theory is the role of humans as a [[keystone species]] who may be able to accomplish global [[homeostasis]]. Whilst a few social scientists who draw inspiration from 'organic' views of society have embraced Gaia philosophy as a way to explain the human-nature interconnections, most professional social scientists are more involved in reflecting upon the way Gaia philosophy is used and engaged with within sub-sections of society. Alan Marshall, in the Department of Social Sciences at Mahidol University, for example, reflects upon the way Gaia philosophy has been used and advocated by environmentalists, spiritualists, managers, economists, and scientists and engineers (see The Unity of Nature, 2002, Imperial College Press: London and Singapore). Social Scientists themselves in the 1960s gave up on systems ideas of society since they were interpreted as supporting conservatism and traditionalism.

== Gaia in politics ==

Some radical political environmentalists who accept some form of the Gaia theory call themselves [[Gaian Greens|Gaians]]. They actively seek to restore the Earth's homeostasis — whenever they see it out of balance, e.g. to prevent manmade [[climate change]], [[primate]] extinction, or [[deforestation|rainforest loss]]. In effect, they seek to cooperate to become the "system consciously manipulating to make conditions more conducive to life". Such activity defines the homeostasis, but for leverage it relies on deep investigation of the homeorhetic balances, if only to find [[places to intervene in a system]] which is changing in undesirable ways.

Tony Bondhus brings up the point in his book, ''Society of Conceivia'', that if Gaia is alive, then societies are living things as well. This suggests that our understanding of Gaia can be used to create a better society and to design a better political system.

Other intellectuals in the environmental movement, like [[Edward Goldsmith]], have used Gaia in the completely opposite way; to stake a claim about how Gaia's focus on natural balance and resistance and resilience, should be emulated to design a conservative political system (as explored in Alan Marshall's 2002 book ''The Unity of Nature'', (Imperial College Press: London).

Gaians do not passively ask "what is going on", but rather, "what to do next", e.g. in [[terraforming]] or [[climate engineering]] or even on a small scale, such as [[gardening]]. Changes can be planned, agreed upon by many people, being very deliberate, as in [[urban ecology]] and especially [[industrial ecology]]. ''See [[arcology]] for more on this 'active' view.''

Gaians argue that it is a human [[duty]] to act as such - committing themselves in particular to the [[Precautionary Principle]]. Such views began to influence the [[Green Parties]], [[Greenpeace]], and a few more radical wings of the [[environmental movement]] such as the Gaia Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front. These views dominate some such groups, e.g. the [[Bioneers]]. Some refer to this political activity as a separate and radical branch of the [[ecology movement]], one that takes the axioms of the science of ecology in general, and Gaia theory in particular, and raises them to a kind of theory of [[personal conduct]] or [[moral code]].

== Gaia in religion ==

The ecologist and theologian Anne Primavesi is the author of two books dealing with the Gaia hypothesis and theology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westarinstitute.org/membership/westar-fellows/fellows-directory/anne-primavesi/ Anne Primavesi - Westar Institute Westar Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosemary Radford Ruether]], the American feminist scholar and theologian, wrote a book called "Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing".

A book edited by Allan Hunt Badiner called Dharma Gaia explores the ground where Buddhism and ecology meet through writings by the [[Dalai Lama]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Joanna Macy]], [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], and 25 other Buddhists and ecologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parallax.org/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=BOOKDG] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315015100/http://www.parallax.org/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=BOOKDG |date=March 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many new age authors have written books which mix [[New Age]] teachings with Gaia philosophy. This is known as [[New Age Gaian]]. Often referred to as Gaianism, or the Gaian Religion, this spiritual aspect of the philosophy is very broad and inclusive, making it adaptable to other religions: Taoism, Neo-Paganism, Pantheism, Judeo-Christian Religions, and many others.

== Semantic debate ==

The question of "what is an [[organism]]", and at what scale is it rational to speak about organisms vs. biospheres, gives rise to a semantic debate. We are all ecologies in the sense that our (human) bodies contain [[gut bacteria]], [[parasite]] species, etc., and to them our body is not organism but rather more of a [[microclimate]] or [[biome]]. Applying that thinking to whole planets:

The argument is that these symbiotic organisms, being unable to survive apart from each other and their climate and local conditions, form an organism in their own right, under a wider conception of the term organism than is conventionally used. It is a matter for often heated debate whether this is a valid usage of the term, but ultimately it appears to be a [[semantic dispute]]. In this sense of the word organism, it is argued under the theory that the entire biomass of the Earth is a single organism (as [[Johannes Kepler]] thought).

Unfortunately, many supporters of the various Gaia theories do not state exactly where they sit on this spectrum; this makes discussion and criticism difficult.

Much effort on behalf of those analyzing the theory currently is an attempt to clarify what these different hypotheses are, and whether they are proposals to 'test' or 'manipulate' outcomes. Both Lovelock's and Margulis's understanding of Gaia are considered scientific hypotheses, and like all scientific theories are constantly put to the test.

More speculative versions of Gaia, including all versions in which it is held that the Earth is actually conscious, are currently held to be outside the bounds of science, and are not supported by either Lovelock or Margulis.

=== Gaian reproduction ===

One of the most problematic issues with referring to Gaia as an organism is its apparent failure to meet the [[biological]] criterion of being able to [[reproduce]]. [[Richard Dawkins]] has asserted that the planet is not the offspring of any parents and is unable to reproduce.&lt;ref name="Harding2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harding, Stephan |title=Animate Earth |publisher=[[Chelsea Green Publishing]] |date=2006 |pages=65 |isbn=1-933392-29-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gernot Böhme''' (born 3 January 1937 in [[Dessau]]) is a German [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and author, contributing to the philosophy of science, theory of time, aesthetics, ethics, and philosophical anthropology. He is the main pioneer of German ecocriticism, the study of the relationship between culture and the environment. He has been the director of the Institute for Practical Philosophy in [[Darmstadt]] since 2005.&lt;ref name="MindMatter"&gt;[http://www.mindmatter.de/resources/pdf/authors9_2www.pdf Mind &amp; Matter Vol. 9(2), "About Authors", 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being one of Germany's most acclaimed public intellectuals, very little of his work has so far been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=713&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
Böhme studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at Göttingen and Hamburg, and completed a PhD in 1965 at Hamburg University.
As a research scientist he worked at the [[Max-Planck-Institute]] with [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]. From 1977 to

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3246">'''Gideon Rosen''' (born 1962) is an American philosopher. He is a Stuart Professor of [[Philosophy]] and the chair of the philosophy department at [[Princeton University]]. He completed his Ph.D. at Princeton in 1992, under [[Paul Benacerraf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.princeton.edu/sites/philosophy/files/person/cv/rosen_cv.pdf CV]&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]] before joining the Princeton faculty in 1993. He has served as chair of Princeton's Council of the Humanities and director of the Behrman Undergraduate Society of Fellows.

==Philosophy==

In 1990 Rosen introduced [[modal fictionalism]], a popular position on the ontological status of possible worlds. He is the co-author of ''A Subject with No Object'' (Oxford University Press, 1997), a contribution to the philosophy of mathematics written with Princeton colleague [[John P. Burgess]]. His recent work in metaphysics is about the concept of [[Grounding (metaphysics)|ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Gideon|date=2017|title=Ground by Law|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/ROSGBL|journal=Philosophical Issues|volume=27|issue=1|pages=279–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosen's work in [[moral philosophy]] has also been influential. He argues for a new variety of skepticism about moral responsibility, separate from the traditional dilemma posed by the [[compatibilism]] ([[incompatibilism]]) problem. His view is that there is an epistemic problem for positive judgments of responsibility. Such judgments are never justified because they are necessarily under-evidenced in a certain way, due to the natures of [[Norm (philosophy)|normativity]] and normative ignorance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Gideon|date=2004|title=Skepticism About Moral Responsibility|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/ROSSAM|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=18|issue=1|pages=295–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4391">'''Giulio Pace de Beriga'''&lt;ref&gt;Also known as Giulio Pacio, or by his Latin name Julius Pacius of Beriga.&lt;/ref&gt; (9 April 1550 – 1635) was a well-known Italian [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] scholar and jurist.

==Life==
He was born in [[Vicenza]], [[Italy]],  and studied [[law]] and [[philosophy]] in [[Padua]].

He was deeply moved by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The [[Catholic Church]] considered him immoral and a lover of [[heresy|heretical]] writings and he found himself put on [[Trial (law)|trial]] by the [[Inquisition]]. Fleeing first to [[Geneva]] to escape their wrath, he soon converted to [[Protestantism]] while in [[Heidelberg]].

His academic career was wide and varied, as he became an itinerant figure. In Geneva, he was elected as a public professor, and taught from 1575 to 1585. Studious and having a deep knowledge of [[Greek language|Greek]], he translated Aristotle. He taught law at the [[University of Heidelberg]], from 1585 to 1594. Incidentally, while he was at Heidelberg, his quarrels with compatriot [[Scipione Gentili]] ultimately compelled the latter to leave for [[University of Altdorf|Altdorf]]. Also while there he showed his [[Ramist]] sympathies, but came into conflict with the philosophical faculty for trying to give private tuition in Ramist logic.&lt;ref&gt;http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-817430-6.pdf, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending 1595 teaching logic at the [[Academy of Sedan]], he was [[Provost (education)|provost]] and prefect of studies at the [[University of Nimes]], from 1597 to 1600. He also taught philosophy in [[Hungary]], [[Leiden]] in the [[Netherlands]], [[Grenoble]] in [[France]], and in other places.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} At the [[University of Montpellier]], where he was from 1600 to 1616, [[Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc]] was his pupil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/peiresc.html Galileo Project page]&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught at the [[University of Valence]], 1620-1, before taking a position at Padua where he taught from 1621 to 1635.&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Schmitt, Quentin Skinner (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (1990), pp. 828-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Pace's edition of the ''[[Organon]]'' became standard during its life of 11 editions between 1584 and 1623, and even longer in the north of Europe. He also wrote a great many legal titles.

Pace wrote a pocket summary of [[Ramon Llull]]'s art, first in [[Latin]] in 1618 and then in [[French language|French]] in 1619. This work is seen as exceptional among its contemporaries as it does not digress into [[alchemy]], [[cabalism]], or [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], and in fact stays true to Llull's traditional interests. Pace wrote a similar work for [[Petrus Ramus|Ramus]] as well.

Despite being a Protestant, in 1619 he published "De dominio maris Hadriatici dissertatio", defending the claims of the [[Venetian Republic]] to dominion over the [[Adriatic Sea]], against the opposite claims of the Empire and the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. This controversy in early international law lined him up with [[Paolo Sarpi]], against [[Valenzuela Velázquez]] and [[Lorenzo Motino]].&lt;ref&gt;Guido Acquaviva, ''Il Dominio di Venezia sul Mare Adriatico nelle opere di Paolo Sarpi e Giulio Pace'' (Giuffre': Milan, 2007) ({{ISBN|88-14-13440-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Hendrik Willem Verzijl, Wybo P. Heere, J. P. S. Offerhaus, ''International Law in Historical Perspective: Nationality and other matters relating to individuals'' (1968), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

A book was written on the life of Giulio Pace in the early 20th century, focusing on his work as a jurist.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Franceschini, ''Giulio Pace da Beriga e la giurisprudenza dei suoi tempi'', Venezia: Officine Grafiche di Carlo Ferrari, 1903,&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11051">'''Godfrey of Fontaines''' (born sometime before 1250, died October 29 in 1306 or 1309). His name in Latin was '''Godefridus de Fontibus''', and was a [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]] and [[theology|theologian]], designated by the title Doctor Venerandus. He made contributions to a diverse range of subjects ranging from moral philosophy to epistemology. However, he is best known today for his work on [[metaphysics]].

== Early biography ==

Godfrey was born sometime before 1250 in the principality of [[Liège (city)|Liège]] in present-day Belgium. He was likely born at Fontaines-les-Hozémont, a château owned by his noble family.

== Formation ==

Godfrey was a student at the [[University of Paris]] by at least 1277, but more probably as early as 1270, as he was likely there during the second regency of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1269-1272) who had returned to Paris from the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Santa Sabina ''studium provinciale'']].  Aquinas' teaching was perhaps the strongest influence on Godfrey's own thought, though he differed on issues such as the [[principle of individuation]], and the distinction between essence and existence in material things.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06626a.htm  Accessed 3-6-2013&lt;/ref&gt;  A notebook from his student years has been dated around 1271-1274 demonstrating his familiarity with views “proposed by [[Siger of Brabant]] and [[Boethius of Dacia]], leading representatives of the radical Aristotelian movement in the Arts faculty at the time.

== Career ==

He was a "Magister", or Master of Theology at the University of Paris by at least 1285 because that is when he gave his first Quodlibet, which means had earned his Magister regens in Theology by this time and because one would have to be at least thirty-five for this honor, this offers the reasoning that his birthday is 1250 or earlier for his year of birth. He was Magister regens from 1285–1299 and then again in 1303-1304. Godfrey was held in high esteem during his life, and held a number of ecclesiastical offices, including Canon of Liege, Canon of Tournai, Provost of St. Severin in Cologne (1287–1295), and possibly Canon of Paris. In 1300 he was chosen to be the Bishop of Tournai, but he chose not to take the position due to a contested election. Godfrey left Paris between his final Quodlibet in 1298-1299 - 1303/1304 yet returned before he died on October 29, 1306 or 1309. He had compiled a large library during his lifetime, which he donated to the [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] upon his death, a portion of which is still intact.

== Writings ==

The most significant of Godfrey's writings are transcriptions of Quodlibets, for which he participated in fifteen of during his tenure at the University of Paris. These were week-long sessions held before Christmas and Easter in which participating Masters were required to answer questions chosen by their students. This was taxing to the Master, who would have to argue a thoughtful and researched answer on an incredibly diverse range of subjects. Many Masters chose not to engage in the Quodlibets. Godfrey of Fontaines completed at least fifteen Quodlibetal sessions. Hence, Godfrey discussed a very wide range of issues. These and other writings show him to have been not merely a distinguished theologian and philosopher, but also a canonist, jurist, moralist, and conversationalist, who took an active part in the various [[ecclesiastical]], doctrinal, and disciplinary disputes that stirred Paris at that period.

Godfrey was reportedly influenced by Thomas Aquinas, and was a defender of [[Thomism]] against his contemporaries. Thomism was a novel theory at the time, and was condemned by [[Étienne Tempier]], [[Bishop of Paris]] ([[Condemnation of 1277]]), and opposed by [[John Peckham]] and many others. This is despite Godfrey attacking the [[mendicant orders]] throughout his career, whereas Aquinas was a member of the Dominican mendicant order. Wippel says, Godfrey opposed the Mendicant orders for the belief that, "those who had confessed to mendicants by reason of the privileges granted to the latter by Pope Martin's bull were still bound to confess the same sins once again to their own priests."

One of Godfrey's largest contributions were to the field of metaphysics. He was opposed to platonic arguments advanced from his contemporaries, such as [[Henry of Ghent]]. For example, he argued against the concept of platonic ideal forms, and that something's essential substance and existence were one and the same. His philosophy was strongly influenced by Aristotle.

In the Quodlibetal VIII, Godfrey argues against the Franciscan Christian order and lays an early groundwork of political philosophy where he discusses the ideas of natural rights. Godfrey believed that natural law was dependent on individual self-preservation rather than a religious obligation; he says, “because by natural law each person is obliged to maintain his life…each person has dominion and a certain right in the common exterior goods of this world, a right that he cannot licitly renounce”, says author Jussi Varkemma as noted in Conrad Summenhart’s Theory of Individual Rights. He objects that the fundamental Franciscan approach to rights is illicit to human activity and natural rights. He says later that everyone has a right to subsistence - a right that people can never renounce. This applies to the mendicant orders because it applies to all members of society.

Stephen D. Dumont quotes Godfrey, in the book Philosophical Debates at Paris in the Early 14th Century, that “Medieval sources are nearly unanimous in identifying Godfrey as a prominent source for the unusual but very influential account of intention and remission known as the ‘succession of forms." As explained by Dumont, Intension and remission of forms concerns the problem of a change of degree within a given kind of quality, like the shading of a color, adjustment of heat or even the altering of moral or cognitive habits. Godfrey held the position that all specific forms are “in their nature indivisible, invariable, and lacking in degrees” (43) and “the specific form of a quality in itself does not undergo any intension or remission but does so insofar as it is individuated in a subject.” This line of thought differs drastically from other thinkers around this time like Thomas Aquinas and Henry of Ghent, who held that there was a variation of specific forms which are a divisible extensions. Godfrey refutes their claims through the reasoning that because qualities cannot change in degree because they are indivisible then they must change insofar as they are individuals, so he concludes that a “change in degree in an individual quality will also be a change of the individual itself, even when its species remains the same”.

Nine other noteworthy topics that Godfrey wrote about in the Quodlibetal are Subject of metaphysics, Division of being, Analogy of being, Transcendentals, Essence and existence, Knowledge of God’s existence and essence, eternity of the world, Substance and accidents, and Abstraction

== Influence ==

The ''XIV Quodlibeta'' of Godfrey, extensively studied and multiplied in manuscript form in the medieval schools, were published for the first time at the beginning of the 20th century. A critical edition of the first four of them appeared in the series "Les Philosophes Belges, Textes et Etudes" (II, "Les quatre premiers Quodlibets de Godefroid de Fontaines", by de Wulf and Pelzer, Louvain, 1904). &lt;!--The remaining Quodlibeta (V-XIV) will form vols. III and IV of the same series; vol. V is to contain studies on Godfrey by de Wulf, de Munnynck, and Van Roel.; some volumes published in the 1930s.--&gt;

Sometime in the 14th century, Godfrey, though well known in his own time, fell out of favour into near-total obscurity. Thomas Aquinas sparked plenty of controversy and discussion in philosophy and theology in the last quarter century of the  13th century. Many significant writers lived during this period, but for the most part, until the 20th century only Thomas Aquinas and [[Duns Scotus]] received any recognition. Godfrey may have been just as significant in his own time as these two, yet for some reason his works were only edited and published as of the early 20th century. This may have more to do with his political affiliation than anything else. Religious Scholars of this time became well known in the long run based mainly on how well promoted they were by the mendicant orders. Thomas Aquinas was promoted by the [[Dominican order]], and Duns Scotus was promoted by the [[Franciscan order]]. Despite this, Godfrey of Fontaines writings have, by the 1960s, regained much popularity.

==Biography==
Zuigan was influential in the development of Buddhism in America in the early 20th century. He was a student of the Zen master [[Tetsuo Sōkatsu]] and followed him to California in 1906 with a group of fourteen who went to the US with [[Tetsuo Sōkatsu]] in 1906, attempting strawberry farming in [[Hayward, California]], and founding a branch of [[Ryomo Kyokai]] on Sutter Street in San Francisco.{{sfn|Fields|1992|p=176}}{{refn|group=note|The Ryomo-kyokai may have been the first Zen center in modern Japan dedicated to teaching meditation to laypersons, and it became the model for the urban lay meditation centers that were so influential in the propagation of Zen practice in western America.{{sfn|Fields|1992|p=176}}}}

Zuigan returned to Japan in 1910. In 1916 Sōkatsu bestowed upon him the [[Dharma transmission|Inka Shōmei]].{{refn|group=note|Inka Shomei, or [[Dharma transmission]], qualifies one to train students within the Rinzai sect as a [[Zen master#Rinzai|Shike]] (master).}} He then spent fifteen years as a missionary in Seoul.{{sfn|Stirling|2006|p=49-50}}

Later, he returned to Japan and taught at the temple Daitoku-ji in Kyoto.{{sfn|Stirling|2006|p=49-50}}

==Notable students==
Among Zuigan's notable students were:
* The American religious scholar [[Huston Smith]] who studied with Zuigan for fifteen years.{{sfn|Stirling|2006|p=21}} 
* Pianist [[Walter Nowick]] who studied with Zuigan at [[Daitoku-ji]] beginning in 1950 until Zuigan's death in 1965. 
* [[Sōkō Morinaga]], Nowick's Dharma brother, who wrote in "Novice to Master: An Ongoing Lesson in the Extent of My Own Stupidity", who was also a head of Hanazono University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.buddhismplace.com/PageCreation?nodeId=69145581 |title=The Buddhism Place |access-date=2013-05-21 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130628201115/http://www.buddhismplace.com/PageCreation?nodeId=69145581 |archive-date=2013-06-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Darhma (dhamma) is a term for the collective teachings (doctrine or personal reality) of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Buddhism/2005/04/The-Three-Jewels-Of-Buddhism.aspx# The Three Jewels of Buddhism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28682">In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], '''Heavenly Mother''' or the '''Mother in Heaven''' is the mother of human [[Spirit body|spirit]]s and the wife of [[God in Mormonism|God the Father]]. Those who accept the Mother in Heaven doctrine trace its origins to [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. The doctrine became more widely known after [[death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]] in 1844.

The heavenly Mother doctrine is taught by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution= Pre-Mortal Existence |title= Mormonism |publisher= BBC |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/mormon/beliefs/existence_1.shtml |date= 2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Restoration Church of Jesus Christ]],&lt;ref name="rcjc.org"&gt;[http://www.rcjc.org/ Role of women in the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ] (On menu on right of website, click on "Core Beliefs" and then click on "The Role of Women") {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701094251/http://www.rcjc.org/ |date=July 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Role of Women in the Church |publisher= [[Restoration Church of Jesus Christ]] |url= http://home.netcom.com/~utahdude/rcjc/rcjc_wom.html |accessdate= 2006-07-17 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080617125455/http://home.netcom.com/~utahdude/rcjc/rcjc_wom.html |archivedate= 2008-06-17 }}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and branches of [[Mormon fundamentalism]], such as the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The doctrine is not generally recognized by other denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement, such as the [[Community of Christ]], where [[Trinity|trinitarianism]] is predominant.

In the LDS Church, the doctrine of "heavenly Mother" or "heavenly parents" is not frequently discussed; however, the doctrine can be found in some church hymns and has been briefly discussed in church teaching manuals and sermons.&lt;ref&gt;"[[O My Father (hymn)|O My Father]]" ([[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|LDS hymn]] #292) refers to a mother in heaven. "[[Oh, What Songs of the Heart]]" (LDS hymn #286) refers to "heavenly parents", and "We Meet Again As Sisters" (LDS hymn #311) to "heav'nly parents". "[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]" mentions "heavenly parents". Various LDS Church curriculum materials refer to a heavenly Mother. E.g.: [//www.lds.org/manual/the-latter-day-saint-woman-basic-manual-for-women-part-a/gospel-principles-and-doctrine/lesson-9-chastity-and-modesty "Lesson 9: Chastity and Modesty"], ''The Latter-day Saint Woman: Basic Manual for Women, Part A'' (2000); [//www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-2-our-heavenly-family "Chapter 2: Our Heavenly Family"], ''[[Gospel Principles]]'', pp. 8–12 (2009); [[Spencer W. Kimball]], [//www.lds.org/ensign/1978/05/the-true-way-of-life-and-salvation "The True Way of Life and Salvation"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', May 1978, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the theology ==
{{further|Exaltation (Mormonism)}}
The theological underpinnings of a belief in Heavenly Mother are attributed to Joseph Smith, who shortly before his death in 1844 outlined a controversial view of God that differed dramatically from traditional Christian consensus.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[King Follett Discourse]], Smith 1844. Also: {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|132|19|20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's theology included the belief that God would share his glory with his children and that righteous couples might become [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exalted]] beings, or gods and goddesses, in the afterlife.

Although there is no known record of Smith explicitly teaching about heavenly Mother, several of Smith's contemporaries attributed the theology to him either directly, or as a natural consequence of his theological stance. An editorial footnote of ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' 5:254, quotes Smith as saying: "Come to me; here's the mysteries man hath not seen, Here's our Father in heaven, and Mother, the Queen." In addition, a secondhand account states that in 1839, Smith had told [[Zina D. H. Young|Zina Diantha Huntington]], after the death of her mother, that "not only would she know her mother again on the other side, but 'more than that, you will meet and become acquainted with your eternal Mother, the wife of your Father in Heaven{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Wilcox 1987"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilcox|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65}}

In addition, members of the [[Anointed Quorum]], a highly select leadership group in the early church that was privy to Smith's teachings, also acknowledged the existence of a Heavenly Mother.&lt;ref name="Wilcox 1987" /&gt;{{rp|65–67}}&lt;ref&gt;Orson Pratt 1876, p. 292; Wilford Woodruff 1875, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' published a letter to the editor from a pseudonymous person named "Joseph's Speckled Bird", in which the author stated that in the pre-Earth life, the spirit "was a child with his father and mother in heaven".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph's Speckled Bird 1845, p. 892.&lt;/ref&gt; The apostle [[Parley P. Pratt|Parley Pratt]] even taught in an official church periodical that God may have had multiple wives before Christ's time, and that after the death of Mary (the mother of Jesus) she may have become another eternal wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pratt|first1=Parley|title=The Seer|date=1853|page=158,172|url=https://archive.org/stream/seereditedbyorso01unse#page/158/mode/1up|accessdate=9 October 2017|quote=Inasmuch as God was the first husband to her, it may be that He only gave her to be the wife of Joseph while in this mortal state, and that He intended after the resurrection to again take her as one of his wives to raise up immortal spirits in eternity. ... We have now clearly shown that God the Father had a plurality of wives, one or more being in eternity by whom He begat our spirits as well as the spirit of Jesus His First Born, and another being upon the earth by whom He begat the tabernacle of Jesus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dana|first1=Bruce E.|title=The Eternal Father and His Son|date=September 2004|page=62|publisher=Cedar Fort Inc.|isbn=1555177883|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-z8NVySmnmcC&amp;ots=zbVT_DkTjy&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, after the [[death of Joseph Smith|death of Smith]], the poet [[Eliza Roxcy Snow]] published a poem entitled "My Father in Heaven", (later titled "Invocation, or the Eternal Father and Mother", now used as the lyrics in the Latter-day Saint hymn "[[O My Father (hymn)|O My Father]]"), which acknowledged the existence of a heavenly Mother.&lt;ref&gt;Snow 1845. See also: {{Harvnb|Derr|1996–97}}; {{Harvnb|Pearson|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem contained the following language:

{{poemquote|In the heavens are parents single?
No, the thought makes reason stare.
Truth is reason: truth eternal
tells me I've a mother there.

When I leave this frail existence,
When I lay this mortal by,
Father, Mother, may I meet you
in your royal courts on high?}}

Some early Mormons considered Snow to be a "[[prophetess]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Abstract of ''Poems, religious, historical, and political'' |publisher= Harold B. Lee Library/Online Collections at BYU |url= http://relarchive.byu.edu/MPNC/descriptions/poems.html |accessdate= 2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Joseph F. Smith]] (a nephew of Joseph Smith) explained his own belief that "God revealed that principle that we have a mother as well as a father in heaven to Joseph Smith; Joseph Smith revealed it to Eliza Snow Smith, his wife; and Eliza Snow was inspired, being a poet, to put it into verse."&lt;ref name="Wilcox 1987" /&gt;{{rp|65}} A companion hymn "Our Mother in Heaven" was published in the church's ''[[Juvenile Instructor]]'' four decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aston|first1=Warren|title=Remembering Mother in Heaven|journal=Meridian Magazine|date=22 April 2014|url=https://ldsmag.com/article-1-14243/|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=William Chase|title=Our Mother in Heaven: Companion Hymn to E.R.

The doctrine is also attributed to several other early church leaders. According to one sermon by [[Brigham Young]], Smith once said he "would not worship a God who had not a father; and I do not know that he would if he had not a mother; the one would be as absurd as the other."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal of Discourses]]'', vol. 9, p.&amp;nbsp;286&lt;/ref&gt;

== Worship and prayer to Heavenly Mother ==
[[Orson Pratt]], an early [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] of the LDS Church, opposed worshiping a heavenly Mother, because, he reasoned, like wives and children in any household, heavenly Mother was required to "yield the most perfect obedience to" her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Orson Pratt |first= Orson |last= Pratt |contribution= Celestial Marriage |title= [[The Seer (periodical)|The Seer]] |volume= 1 |issue= 10 |page= 159 |date=October 1853 |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/18108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early leader [[George Q. Cannon]] thought that "there is too much of this inclination to deify 'our mother in heaven{{'"}}, arguing that she is not part of the Godhead and that to worship her would detract from the worship of heavenly Father.&lt;ref name="Paulsen &amp; Pulido 2011"&gt;{{Harvnb|Paulsen|Pulido|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}} However, early 20th-century church leader [[Rudger Clawson]] disagreed, arguing that "it doesn't take away from our worship of the Eternal Father, to adore our Eternal Mother ... [W]e honor woman when we acknowledge Godhood in her eternal prototype."&lt;ref name="Paulsen &amp; Pulido 2011" /&gt;{{rp|79}}

Some church leaders have interpreted the term "God" to represent the divinely exalted couple with both a masculine and feminine half. [[Erastus Snow]], an early Mormon apostle, wrote {{"'}}do you mean we should understand that Deity consists of a man and woman?' Most certainly I do. If I believe anything that God has ever said about himself ... I must believe that deity consists of a man and woman." This notion was reaffirmed by later church leaders [[Hugh B. Brown]], [[James E. Talmage]], [[Melvin J. Ballard]], and [[Bruce R. McConkie]].&lt;ref name="Paulsen &amp; Pulido 2011" /&gt;{{rp|79–80}}

Some Mormon feminists have adopted the practice of praying to the heavenly Mother. However, LDS Church president [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] opposed this practice, saying that Mormons should not pray to the heavenly Mother because Christ instructed his disciples to address the heavenly Father in their prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinckley|1991|pp=97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a feminist professor was fired from [[Brigham Young University]] in the 1990s, it was revealed that one of the reasons was her public advocacy of praying to heavenly Mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Academic Freedom and Tenure: Brigham Young University |publisher= American Association of University Professors |date= September–October 1997 |url= http://www.aaup.org/Com-a/Institutions/archives/1997/Brigham.pdf |accessdate= 2006-07-20 |deadurl= bot: unknown |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060813015547/http://www.aaup.org/Com-a/Institutions/archives/1997/Brigham.pdf |archivedate= 2006-08-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Mormon women have been excommunicated for similar publications such as teaching that Heavenly Mother is the Holy Ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stack|first1=Peggy Fletcher|title=A Mormon mystery returns: Who is Heavenly Mother?|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56282764&amp;itype=CMSID|accessdate=16 September 2017|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acknowledgment by the LDS Church ==
The LDS Church did not formally acknowledge the existence of a heavenly Mother until 1909, in a statement on the "origin of man" by the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] on the 50th anniversary of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith et al. 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; The church also later implied the theology in the 1995 statement "[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]", where the church officially stated that each person is a "spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents". Other references to heavenly parents can be found in Latter-day Saint speeches and literature.&lt;ref&gt;E.g.: {{Harvnb|Hinckley|1991}}, encouraging Latter-day Saint women not to pray to the heavenly Mother, and [[M. Russell Ballard]] stating, "we are part of a divine plan designed by Heavenly Parents who love us" in his book ''When Thou Art Converted''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, an official essay was published on the church website which surveyed 171 years of statements about a Mother in Heaven and confirmed that it is part of church doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tad Walch |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865639745/LDS-Church-releases-new-essays-about-women-and-the-priesthood-and-Heavenly-Mother.html?pg=all |title=LDS Church releases new essays about women and the priesthood and Heavenly Mother |publisher=Deseret News |date= |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statements by church leaders ===
Various LDS Church leaders throughout the history of the church have spoken openly about the doctrine of a heavenly Mother.

[[Brigham Young]], who taught [[Adam–God doctrine|Adam is Heavenly Father]], taught that his wife Eve is heavenly Mother: "I tell you more, Adam is the father of our spirits ... [O]ur spirits and the spirits of all the heavenly family were begotten by Adam, and born of Eve. ... I tell you, when you see your Father in the Heavens, you will see Adam; when you see your Mother that bore your spirit, you will see Mother Eve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Manuscript Addresses of Brigham Young, Oct. 8, 1854 | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/86490565/Brigham-Young-s-October-8-1854-Discourse}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Since the LDS Church has formally denounced since the 1970s the [[Adam–God doctrine]] as taught by Young,&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer W. Kimball]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1976/11/our-own-liahona "Our Own Liahona,"] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', November 1976, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; today this statement is doctrinal only to certain groups of [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalists]].) Young also preached that resurrected "eternal mothers" would "be prepared to frame earths like unto ours".&lt;ref name="Paulsen &amp; Pulido 2011" /&gt;{{rp|80}}

[[Susa Young Gates]], a daughter of Young and a women's rights activist, stated that the "great Heavenly Mother was the great molder" of [[Abraham]]'s personality. "Gates speculated that Heavenly Mother has played a significant role in all our lives, looking over us with 'watchful care' and providing 'careful training.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Paulsen &amp; Pulido 2011" /&gt;{{rp|75}}

Early 20th-century church leader [[B. H. Roberts]] pointed out that the heavenly Mother doctrine presents a "conception of the nobility of women and of motherhood and of wife-hood—placing her side by side with the Divine Father."&lt;ref name="Paulsen &amp; Pulido 2011" /&gt;{{rp|77}} Apostle [[John A. Widtsoe]], a contemporary of Roberts, wrote that the afterlife "is given radiant warmth by the thought that ... [we have] a mother who possesses the attributes of Godhood."&lt;ref name="Paulsen &amp; Pulido 2011" /&gt;{{rp|78}} In 1894, ''[[Juvenile Instructor]]'', an official publication of the LDS Church, published a hymn entitled "Our Mother in Heaven".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Juvenile Instructor]]'', vol. 29, no. 8 (April 15, 1894): 263.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1925 First Presidency statement included the lines "All men and women are in the similitude of the universal Father and Mother . ... [M]an, as a spirit, was begotten and born of heavenly parents . ... [and] is capable, by experience through ages and aeons [sic], of evolving into a God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origin of Man &amp; Organic Evolution|date=2004|publisher=Brigham Young University-Idaho|location=Rexburg, Idaho|pages=2–3|url=http://emp.byui.edu/marrottr/OriginOfMan.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805030919/http://emp.byui.edu/marrottr/OriginOfMan.pdf|archivedate=5 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='Mormon' View of Evolution|journal=Improvement Era|date=September 1925|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1090–1091|url=https://archive.org/stream/improvementera28011unse#page/1088/mode/2up|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Heber|last2=Ivins|first2=Anthony|last3=Nibley|first3=Charles|title='Mormon' View of Evolution|journal=Deseret News|date=18 July 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been some more recent discussion of heavenly Mother by LDS Church leaders. In a speech given at BYU in 2010, [[Glenn L. Pace]], a member of the LDS Church's [[First Quorum of the Seventy]], said, "Sisters, I testify that when you stand in front of your heavenly parents in those royal courts on high and look into Her eyes and behold Her countenance, any question you ever had about the role of women in the kingdom will evaporate into the rich celestial air, because at that moment you will see standing directly in front of you, your divine nature and destiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= [[Glenn L. Pace]] |title= The Divine Nature and Destiny of Women |date= March 9, 2010 |work= Speeches |publisher= [[Brigham Young University]] |url= http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=12982&amp;x=55&amp;y=2 |accessdate= 2012-08-07 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120318221330/http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=12982&amp;x=55&amp;y=2 |archivedate= March 18, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
{{POV check|section|date=December 2011}}
{{Original research section|date=December 2011}}
According to historian Linda Wilcox, heavenly Mother "is a shadowy and elusive belief floating around the edges of Mormon consciousness".&lt;ref name="Wilcox 1987" /&gt;{{rp|64}} Though the belief is held by most Mormons, the doctrine is not actively advertised by the LDS Church, though heavenly Mother is sometimes mentioned in talks or sermons in [[sacrament meeting]]s and in [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] classes. The topic is most often consistent with the theology discussed above.

The lack of focused teaching and more information about her has caused speculation among Mormons that this de-emphasis may have a divine purpose, such as to avoid drawing attention to her and to preserve the sacredness of her existence. In 1960, an LDS [[LDS Seminary#Seminaries|seminary]] teacher published in a Mormon encyclopedia that "the name of our Mother in Heaven has been withheld" because of the way God the Father's and Jesus Christ's names have been profaned.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin R. Brooks, ''LDS Reference Encyclopedia'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, 1960), p. 309–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret Merrill Toscano writes that "[w]hile no General Authority has made an official statement denying belief in a Heavenly Mother nor stating that her existence is too sacred to discuss, several factors may influence the current trend that sees even a mention of Heavenly Mother as treading on forbidden ground. Members take their cues about what is acceptable doctrine from talks of General Authorities and official church manuals and magazines".&lt;ref name="toscano-sunstone" /&gt; These materials rarely mention heavenly Mother directly. The publicly discussed church discipline of feminists like [[Lynne Kanavel Whitesides]], [[Maxine Hanks]], [[Janice Merrill Allred]], and Margaret Toscano, all of whom were disciplined in part for statements related to the heavenly Mother, may add to the general sense that discourse about her is strictly forbidden.&lt;ref name="toscano-sunstone"&gt;[[Margaret Merrill Toscano]], ''Is There a Place For Heavenly Mother In Mormon Theology''; [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]; July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Brigham Young University professor [[David L. Paulsen]] has argued that such a belief finds no official backing in statements by church leaders, and that the concept that the heavenly Mother is consigned to a "sacred silence" is largely the result of a relatively recent cultural perception.&lt;ref name="Paulsen &amp; Pulido 2011" /&gt;{{rp|75}}

Though LDS Church president [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] has said the prohibition on praying to heavenly Mother in no way "belittles or denigrates her", some{{who|date=August 2012}} feel that it makes her seem less important than heavenly Father. Others assume that both heavenly parents are equally important and expect that more will be revealed when we are ready.{{editorializing|date=August 2012}} Mormon fundamentalists believe that heavenly Father has multiple wives, and that although humankind shares the same heavenly Father, they do not all share the same heavenly Mother.

The question of how heavenly Mother is regarded ties into a larger set of questions among many Mormons about power in relationships between men and women. When asked why God said that Adam would rule over Eve, Hinckley said, "I do not know ... My own interpretation of that sentence is that the husband shall have a governing responsibility to provide for, to protect, to strengthen and shield the wife. Any man who belittles or abuses or terrorizes, or who rules in unrighteousness, will deserve and, I believe, receive the reprimand of a just God who is the Eternal Father of both His sons and daughters."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinckley|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reported visions of Heavenly Mother ==

Heavenly Mother is absent in the visionary experiences in [[standard works|Mormon scriptures]]. The only recorded visionary experience is related by [[Zebedee Coltrin]] and recorded in the journal of [[Abraham H. Cannon]].

{{quote|One day the Prophet Joseph asked him [Coltrin] and Sidney Rigdon to accompany him into the woods to pray. When they had reached a secluded spot Joseph laid down on his back and stretched out his arms. He told the brethren to lie one on each arm, and then shut their eyes. After they had prayed he told them to open their eyes. They did so and saw a brilliant light surrounding a pedestal which seemed to rest on the earth. They closed their eyes and again prayed. They then saw, on opening them, the Father seated upon a throne; they prayed again and on looking saw the Mother also; after praying and looking the fourth time they saw the Savior added to the group.&lt;ref name="Wilcox 1987n13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilcox|1987}} note 13&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3093">'''Hedwig Conrad-Martius''' ([[Berlin]], 27 February 1888 – [[Starnberg]], 15 February 1966) was a German [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] who became a [[Christian mystic]].

== Life and works ==
She initially considered a literary career, but later became interested in philosophy. This started at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. She also studied at Göttingen. She became known for work on an [[ontology]] of reality. She also married Theodor Conrad who helped provide for her as at this time women academics tended to struggle to make a living. As she had one Jewish grandparent her work was stalled by the rise of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C8G1HfOJz3AC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=%22Hedwig+Conrad-Martius%22+philosophy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=XpjEs1PM0q&amp;sig=pI0_XR9BzZHfU48HjE0uSevrATM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA213,M1 The phenomenological movement: A historical introduction By Herbert Spiegelberg, Karl Schuhmann, pgs 212-214]&lt;/ref&gt; At some point she became religiously active as a Protestant.

== Connection to Edith Stein ==
[[Edith Stein]]'s interest in Catholicism came during a visit to her home. Although Protestant, Conrad-Martius would late receive a dispensation so she could be [[Edith Stein]]'s godmother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8-b8gGEy34YC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=%22Hedwig+Conrad-Martius%22+biography&amp;sig=38ShC2JHeBTWx_b2S4ZIYy1kmAU#PPA42,M1 Three Women in Dark Times: Edith Stein, Hannah Arendt, Simone Weil]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

===Early life===
Roerich was born in the family of Ivan Ivanovich Shaposhnikov, a well-known [[Saint-Petersburg]] architect.

Ekaterina Vassilievna Shaposhnikova, Roerich's mother, belonged to an ancient Golenischev-Kutuzov family, which originated from [[Novgorod]] at the end of the 13th century. Significant members of this family included field marshal [[Mikhail Kutuzov|Mikhail Illarionovich Golenischev-Kutuzov]], well-known poet of the end of 19th century; [[Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov|Arsenii Arkadievich Golenischev-Kutuzov]], composer; and [[Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky]].&lt;ref name="k4"&gt;S. Kluchnikov. Proclaimer of the fire epoch. Story and study about Helena Ivanovna Roerich. Novosibirsk, Siberia department of «Detskaya literature» publishing, 1991. — P.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:H.Roerich St.Petersburg 1900.jpg|thumb|200 px|Helena Ivanovna Roerich. 1900. [[Saint Petersburg]]]]

Roerich grew up and was educated in rich cultural traditions of her family. From childhood she was inquisitive, and independent. She showed talents in a number of areas, playing piano, and by the age of seven reading and writing in three languages.&lt;ref name="k4" /&gt;/ From the very young age, she started reading artistic, historical, spiritual and philosophic books.

In 1895, Roerich graduated from Mariinsky Gymnasium in Saint-Petersburg with a "gold medal", a special award for excellence in the studies. Though the education she received there was of a great quality, Roerich often studied additionally on her own. She learned painting, knew Russian and European literature well, studied the history of religion and philosophy, and took great interest in the works of the Indian philosophers [[Ramakrishna]], [[Vivekananda]], and [[Tagore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Aunovsky |first2=O. K. |last1=[[Victor Skumin|Skumin]] |first1=V. A. |year=1995 |script-title=ru: Светоносцы (о семье Рерихов)|trans-title=The Bringers of the Light (The story of the Roerich family) |url=http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/record/3000010561593?query=%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80+%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD+|isbn=5-88167-004-3 |language=Russian |accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing her education at gymnasium, Roerich entered the [[Saint-Petersburg]] musical private school. The director of this school was I.A. Borovka, a senior of metropolitan conservatoire, and professor of piano playing. He was a noted figure in Petersburg's musical culture of the time, and personally mentored Roerich.

After graduating, which was aimed mainly towards revealing the most gifted candidates who should receive higher music education, Roerich intended to continue her education in the [[Saint-Petersburg]] conservatoire. But her relatives banned her from entering the conservatoire, worried that she would be interested by the revolutionary ideas found in the student environment. Thus, Roerich continued her education at home, where she perfected her grasp of foreign languages, and read many things.

===Marriage and family===
[[File:H.Roerich with her sons.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Helena Roerich (right) with her sons]]

Roerich and her mother often spent the summer at Bologoe in the [[Novgorod]] region, with her aunt E.V. Putyatina, at the estate of her husband, Prince P.A. Putyatin. In 1899, at Bologoe, she met the painter and archeologist Nicholas Konstantinovich Roerich. They fell in love, and in spite of her relatives' opposition, in 1901, she and Nicholas were married in Saint-Petersburg.

In 2001, at the place in Bologoe where they first met, a memorial named "Monument of love" was established. It contains a quotation from N. Roerich's essay "The University": "I met Lada, my partner in life and inspirer, at Bologoe, at Prince P.A. Putyatin's estate. Joy!".&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov M.A. Roerichs and Tver region. Tver: GERS publishing. — 2007. P.33.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a strong alliance of two loving people united by deep mutual feelings and common views.&lt;ref name="s6"&gt;H.I. Roerich's biography at the website of Charitable Foundation named after H.I. Roerich.&lt;/ref&gt; N. Roerich wrote about their marriage in his declining years: "We passed amicably any obstacles. And the obstacles turned into possibilities. I devoted my books: "To Helena, my wife, friend, partner and inspirer".&lt;ref name="s7"&gt;N. K. Roerich. Diary leaves. Volume 2. — Moscow, ICR, 2000. — p.448.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Roerich's paintings were a result of their common creativity. He called her "She who leads"&lt;ref&gt;L. V. Shaposhnikova. Wisdom of ages («Mudrost vekov», in Russian). — Moscow, International Centre of the Roerichs, 2000. — P.448.&lt;/ref&gt; in his books, and asserted that on many his canvases, two signatures should be written: his own, and Roerich's. "We created together, and not without reason it was said that the works must have two names, women's and men's.&lt;ref name="s7" /&gt;

[[File:Helena Roerich (V. Serov).jpg|thumb|right|200 px|&lt;center&gt;"Helena Roerich". 1909. &lt;br /&gt;[[Valentin Serov]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

Nicholas and Roerich had two children. In August 1902, their eldest son George was born. Later, he became a world-renowned scientist and orientalist. Their younger son, Svetoslav, was born in October 1904. He became a [[Painting|painter]].

Roerich supported all of her husband's initiatives, and went deeply into all his fields of study. In 1903—1904, they traveled together through forty old Russian cities to find sources of national history and culture. During these travels, Roerich had taken expert photographs of churches, architecture monuments, paintings, and ornaments. She also mastered the art of restoration and, together with Nicholas Konstantinovich, recovered some the masterpieces of great artists such as Rubens, Breugel, Vandyke, and van Orley, that had been hidden by latest paint layers. She also displayed her artistic intuition by collecting works of art and antiquities. Roerichs collected a beautiful family collection, composed of more than 300 works, which they later had transferred to the Hermitage Museum. Roerich also knew archeology well. Together with her husband, she often left for excavations in the regions of Novgorod's and Tver's, and took part in the work.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kluchnikov. Proclaimer of the fire epoch. Story and study about Helena Ivanovna Roerich. Novosibirsk, Siberia department of «Detskaya literature» publishing, 1991. — P.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

N. Roerich and their sons thought highly of Roerich, and considered her a spiritual leader and keeper of family's foundations.&lt;ref name="s11"&gt;H.I. Roerich's biography at the website of International Centre-Museum named after N.K. Roerich.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, because of a serious lung disease, following the doctor's insistence, the Roerich family moved to Finland (Serdobol), to the seashore of [[Lake Ladoga]]. In 1918, Finland declared its independence and closed the Russian border. In 1919, the family moved to England, and made their home in London.

Here, in 1920, Roerich, in collaboration with a group of anonymous thinkers and philosophers of the East, which in accordance with Indian's spiritual tradition were named "The Great Teachers" (Mahatmas), began to work for the [[Living Ethics]] Teaching (Agni Yoga).

===Travels===
In 1920, N. K. Roerich received an invitation to tour the United States with an exhibition of his paintings. Thus, Roerich's family moved to New York City. Here, the cultural activity was organized under N. Roerich's leadership in partnership with Roerich. The culmination of this was the foundation in America of such cultural organizations as the Nicholas Roerich Museum, the Master-Institute of United Arts, the International painter's association "Cor Ardens" (Flaming Hearts), and the International Art Centre "Corona Mundi" ("Crown of the World").

On December 1923, Roerich, along with her family, moved to India. This country had always been of great interest to the Roerichs. Adoration of India and its spiritual culture was not unusual among some Russian intellectuals of the time, feeling that their moral searches coincided with Indian spiritual tradition.&lt;ref&gt;14 L.V. Shaposhnikova. Wisdom of ages («Mudrost vekov», in Russian). — Moscow, International Centre of the Roerichs, 2000. — P.139.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1924 to 1928, Roerich took part in a Central-Asian expedition organized by [[N. K. Roerich]], that traveled through hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of India, China, Russia ([[Altai Republic|Altai]]), [[Mongolia]] and [[Tibet]]. During the expedition, research in topics such as history, archeology, ethnography, history of philosophy, arts and religions, and geography was conducted. Previously unknown mountain peaks and passes were mapped, rare manuscripts were found, and rich linguistic materials were collected. Special attention was paid to the problem of historical unity of cultures of various peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Museum named after N.K. Roerich. Museum guide. — Moscow, International Centre of the Roerichs, Master-Bank, 2006. — P.262.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was carried out in very difficult conditions. Roerich shared all hardships of the travel with the others: hard passages, robber's attacks, and obstacles created by English officials that nearly have resulted in death of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;L.V. Shaposhnikova. Wisdom of ages («Mudrost vekov», in Russian). — Moscow, International Centre of the Roerichs, 2000. — P.139.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1925. when N. Roerich's expedition stayed in Gulmarg, Roerich began to translate an extensive selection from "Mahatma's Letters" from English to Russian, which she published in London in 1923. She also wrote a book named "Chalice of the East", which was published that year under the pen name "Iskander Khanum".&lt;ref&gt;18 Chalice of the East. Mahatmas Letters. Third edition. — Riga-Moscow-Minsk, «Ligatma-Moga-N» publishing, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roerich's manuscript "Foundations of Buddhism" was published in 1926, at Urga (now Ulan-Bator), where her expedition was staying at the time. In this book, the fundamental philosophical notions of Buddha's Teaching were interpreted. The book also spoke about the moral basis of this Teaching and helped sparkng interest in Buddhism in the west.

In 1927, one of the Living Ethics books ("Community") was published in the same place in Mongolia. After finishing of Central-Asian expedition, Roerichs remained in India, in Kullu valley [[Himachal Pradesh]]. There, in 1928, they had found an Institute of Himalayan Studies "Urusvati" (this means "Light of Morning Star" in Sanskrit). It was planned as institute for complex study of Asian regions which exerted influence on the development of world culture. Among the tasks of the "Urusvati" was the complex study of human, its psychic and physiological features. Roerich became an Honorary President-Founder of the institute and actively took part in organization of its work.&lt;ref&gt;Museum named after N.K. Roerich. Museum guide. — Moscow, International Centre of the Roerichs, Master-Bank, 2006. — P.281.&lt;/ref&gt; Being a subtle art connoisseur and deep philosopher, she knew well the scientific problems of the institute, and often directed the researches as experienced scientist.&lt;ref&gt;H.I. Roerich commemoration meeting at the Centre-Museum named after N.K. Roerich.&lt;/ref&gt; The main task of Roerich's activity was in studying of ancient philosophic thought of the East.&lt;ref&gt;Museum named after N.K. Roerich. Museum guide. — Moscow, International Centre of the Roerichs, Master-Bank, 2006. — P.283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roerich had dreamed that sometime a city of knowledge would rise in Kullu valley, which would become an international scientific centre. Later "Urusvati" became a large international institute that united well-known scientists from many countries. J. Bose, R. Tagore, A. Einstein, R. Millikan, L. de Broglie, R. Magoffin, S. Gedin, S.I. Metalnikov, N.I. Vavilov ''et al.'' had collaborated with it.&lt;ref&gt;Museum named after N.K. Roerich. Museum guide. — Moscow, International Centre of the Roerichs, Master-Bank, 2006. — P.285.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kullu, Roerich continued her work on Living Ethics, the main work of her life. In 1929, her work "Cryptograms of the East" ("On Eastern Crossroads") was published in Paris in Russian under the pen name Josephine Saint-Hilaire. This work contains apocryphal legends and parables from the lives of great devotees and teachers of mankind: Buddha, Christ, Apollonius of Tiana, Akbar the Great, St. Sergius of Radonezh. Roerich devoted a special essay "The Banner of St. Sergius of Radonezh" to an image of the Savior and Defender of Russian land. In this essay she joined knowledge of history and theology with deep and reverent love to the hermit.&lt;ref name="s6" /&gt; is essay was included in the book "Banner of St. Sergius of Radonezh", published under the pen name N. Yarovskaya in 1934.

===Later life===
In the first half of the 1930s, Roerich translated from English to Russian two volumes of H.P. Blavatsky's fundamental work ''Secret Doctrine''.

A special place in Roerich's creativity belongs to her epistolary heritage. She corresponded with more than 140 persons. The letters geography involves several continents. Among Roerich's correspondents were friends, followers, cultural workers, political figures. In her letters, Roerich has answered numerous questions, explained the most complex philosophical and scientific problems, foundations of the Living Ethics. She wrote about great Laws of Cosmos, meaning of human life, importance of culture for human evolution, Great Teachers.&lt;ref name="s11" /&gt;

In 1940, a two-volume edition of ''Letters of Helena Roerich'' was published in Riga. A complete set of Roerich's letters is published by the International Centre of the Roerichs, where her epistolary heritage is kept. It was transferred to ICR by S.N. Roerich in 1990.

During N.K. Roerich's Manchurian expedition, Roerich had corresponded with international organizations and coordinated activity for support the Roerich's Pact (International agreement for protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments). As a result of this work, the Roerich's Pact was signed on April 15, 1935 by heads of 22 countries.&lt;ref name="s11" /&gt;

In January 1948, after her husband's death, Roerich, together with her elder son moved to Delhi and then to Khandala (Bombay's suburb), where they had waited for steamship from Russia with their entrance visas. But Russia denied their visas. They made their home in Kalimpong, though she continued to hope to return to Roerich just like N.K. Roerich had not changed Russian citizenship. But her numerous applications remained without response.

===Death===
Roerich died October 5, 1955. In the place of her cremation the lamas had raised a white stupa on which the following epitaph was carved: "Helena Roerich, the wife of Nicholas Roerich, thinker and writer, old friend of India".&lt;ref&gt;Museum named after N.K. Roerich. Museum guide. — Moscow, International Centre of the Roerichs, Master-Bank, 2006. — P.318,320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nagai's philosophy has been heavily influenced by [[Wittgenstein]], however, his philosophy successfully elucidates an important aspect of solipsism which Wittgenstein could not fully express in his philosophical works. Nagai stresses that the solipsistic subject (such as "I!") can be pointed to by using the public language, but the trial of this pointing ought to be failed every time because of the unique function of our public language. He calls this characteristic "solipsity".&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophy for Kids!"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the philosophical notion of idealism|the ethical principle|Ideal (ethics)|other uses|Idealism (disambiguation)}}
In [[philosophy]], '''Idealism''' is the group of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] philosophies that assert that reality, or reality as humans can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. [[Epistemology|Epistemologically]], Idealism manifests as a [[skepticism]] about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In contrast to [[Materialism]], Idealism asserts the ''primacy'' of consciousness as the origin and prerequisite of material phenomena. According to this view, consciousness exists ''before'' and is the pre-condition of material existence. Consciousness creates and determines the material and not vice versa. Idealism believes consciousness and mind to be the origin of the material world and aims to explain the existing world according to these principles.

Idealism theories are mainly divided into two groups. [[Subjective idealism]] takes as its starting point the given fact of human consciousness seeing the existing world as a combination of sensation. [[Objective idealism]] posits the existence of an ''objective'' consciousness which exists before and, in some sense, independently of human ones. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociology 14th Edition |last=Macionis |first=John J. |year=2012 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-11671-3 |page=88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[ontology|ontological]] doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit.&lt;ref name="Brittanica"/&gt; Idealism thus rejects [[physicalism|physicalist]] and [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind.

The earliest extant arguments that the world of experience is grounded in the mental derive from India and Greece. The [[Hindu idealism|Hindu idealists]] in India and the Greek [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] gave [[panentheism|panentheistic]] arguments for an all-pervading consciousness as the ground or true nature of reality.&lt;ref name="Noiré"/&gt; In contrast, the [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] school, which arose within [[Mahayana]] Buddhism in India in the 4th century CE,&lt;ref&gt;Zim, Robert (1995). ''Basic ideas of ''Yogācāra'' Buddhism.'' San Francisco State University. Source: [http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/Yogacara/basicideas.htm] (Retrieved 18 October 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; based its "mind-only" idealism to a greater extent on [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] analyses of personal experience. This turn toward the [[subjective idealism|subjective]] anticipated [[empiricism|empiricists]] such as [[George Berkeley]], who revived idealism in 18th-century Europe by employing skeptical arguments against [[materialism]]. Beginning with [[Immanuel Kant]], [[German idealism|German idealists]] such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] dominated 19th-century philosophy. This tradition, which emphasized the mental or "ideal" character of all phenomena, gave birth to idealistic and [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] schools ranging from [[British idealism]] to [[phenomenalism]] to [[existentialism]].

Idealism as a philosophy came under heavy attack in [[Western world|the West]] at the turn of the 20th century. The most influential critics of both epistemological and ontological idealism were [[G. E. Moore]] and [[Bertrand Russell]],&lt;ref&gt;Sprigge, T. (1998). [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/idealism/v-1 Idealism]. In The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Taylor and Francis. Retrieved 29 Jun. 2018. DOI: 10.4324/9780415249126-N027-1&lt;/ref&gt; but its critics also included the [[New realism (philosophy)|New Realists]]. According to ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', the attacks by Moore and Russell were so influential that even more than 100 years later "any acknowledgment of idealistic tendencies is viewed in the English-speaking world with reservation". However, many aspects and paradigms of idealism did still have a large influence on subsequent philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

==Definitions==
''Idealism'' is a term with several related meanings. It comes via ''[[idea]]'' from the Greek ''idein'' (ἰδεῖν), meaning "to see". The term entered the English language by 1743.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/90960|title=idealism, n. : Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ordinary use, as when speaking of Woodrow Wilson's [[idealism (international relations)|political idealism]], it generally suggests the priority of ideals, principles, values, and goals over concrete realities. Idealists are understood to represent the world as it might or should be, unlike [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], who focus on the world as it presently is. In the arts, similarly, idealism affirms imagination and attempts to realize a mental conception of beauty, a standard of perfection, juxtaposed to aesthetic [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/idealism|title=Idealism - Define Idealism at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idealism|title=Idealism - Definition of Idealism by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any philosophy that assigns crucial importance to the ideal or spiritual realm in its account of human existence may be termed "idealist". [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] idealism is an [[ontology|ontological]] doctrine that holds that reality itself is [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] or experiential at its core. Beyond this, idealists disagree on which aspects of the mental are more basic. [[Platonic idealism]] affirms that [[abstract object|abstractions]] are more basic to reality than the things we perceive, while [[subjective idealism|subjective idealists]] and [[phenomenalism|phenomenalists]] tend to privilege sensory experience over abstract reasoning. [[Epistemology|Epistemological]] idealism is the view that reality can only be known through ideas, that only psychological experience can be apprehended by the mind.&lt;ref name="Brittanica"&gt;Daniel Sommer Robinson, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/281802/idealism "Idealism"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[On The Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer noted the ambiguity of the word ''idealism'', calling it a "term with multiple meanings". For Schopenhauer, idealists seek to account for the relationship between our ideas and external reality, rather than for the nature of reality as such. Non-Kantian idealists, on the other hand, theorized about mental aspects of the reality underlying phenomena.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip J. Neujahr would "restrict the idealist label to theories which hold that the world, or its material aspects, are dependent upon the specifically cognitive activities of the mind or Mind in perceiving or thinking about (or 'experiencing') the object of its awareness." Philip J. Neujahr, ''Kant's Idealism'', Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjective idealists like [[George Berkeley]] are [[anti-realism|anti-realists]] in terms of a mind-independent world, whereas [[transcendental idealism|transcendental idealists]] like [[Immanuel Kant]] are strong [[skepticism|skeptics]] of such a world, affirming epistemological and not metaphysical idealism. Thus Kant defines ''idealism'' as "the assertion that we can never be certain whether all of our putative outer experience is not mere imagining".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, Notes and Fragments, ed. Paul Guyer, trans. by Curtis Bowman, Paul Guyer, and Frederick Rauscher, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 318, {{ISBN|0-521-55248-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that, according to ''idealism'', "the reality of external objects does not admit of strict proof. On the contrary, however, the reality of the object of our internal sense (of myself and state) is clear immediately through consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;''Critique of Pure Reason'', A 38&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all idealists restrict the real or the knowable to our immediate subjective experience. [[Objective idealism|Objective idealists]] make claims about a transempirical world, but simply deny that this world is essentially divorced from or ontologically prior to the mental. Thus, [[Plato]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] affirm an objective and knowable reality transcending our subjective awareness—a rejection of epistemological idealism—but propose that this reality is grounded in ideal entities, a form of metaphysical idealism. Nor do all metaphysical idealists agree on the nature of the ideal; for Plato, the fundamental entities were non-mental abstract [[Platonic idealism|forms]], while for Leibniz they were proto-mental and concrete [[monadology|monads]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Leibniz"&gt;Mark Kulstad and Laurence Carlin, "Leibniz's Philosophy of Mind", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-mind/&lt;/ref&gt;

As a rule, transcendental idealists like Kant affirm idealism's epistemic side without committing themselves to whether reality is ''ultimately'' mental; objective idealists like Plato affirm reality's metaphysical basis in the mental or abstract without restricting their epistemology to ordinary experience; and subjective idealists like Berkeley affirm both metaphysical and epistemological idealism.&lt;ref name="Gron"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.enotes.com/science-religion-encyclopedia/idealism|title=Idealism |author=ARNE GRØN |date= |work=Encyclopedia of Science and Religion |publisher= |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical idealism==
===Pre-Socratic philosophy===
Idealism as a form of metaphysical [[monism]] holds that consciousness, not matter, is the ground of all being. It is monist because it holds that there is only one type of thing in the universe and idealist because it holds that one thing to be consciousness.

[[Anaxagoras]] (480 BC) taught that "all things" were created by ''[[Nous]]'' ("Mind"). He held that Mind held the cosmos together and gave human beings a connection to the cosmos or a pathway to the divine.

===Platonism and neoplatonism===
[[Plato]]'s [[Theory of Forms|theory of forms]] or "ideas" describes ideal forms (for example the [[platonic solids]] in geometry or abstracts like Goodness and Justice), as [[problem of universals|universals]] existing independently of any particular instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.mdc.edu/jmcnair/Joe6pages/Plato%27s%20Idealism.htm |title=Plato's Idealism |author=J.D.McNair |date= |work=Students' notes |publisher=MIAMI-DADE COMMUNITY COLLEGE |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arne Grøn calls this doctrine "the classic example of a metaphysical idealism as a ''transcendent'' idealism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/science-religion-encyclopedia/idealism |title= Idealism|author= Arne Grøn|date= |work= Encyclopedia of Science and Religion |publisher=eNotes |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Simone Klein calls Plato "the earliest representative of metaphysical objective idealism". Nevertheless, Plato holds that matter is real, though transitory and imperfect, and is perceived by our body and its senses and given existence by the eternal ideas that are perceived directly by our rational soul. Plato was therefore a metaphysical and [[Epistemological dualism|epistemological dualist]], an outlook that modern idealism has striven to avoid:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophos.com/knowledge_base/archives_12/philosophy_questions_12.html |title=What is objective idealism? |author=Simone Klein |date= |work=Philosophy Questions |publisher=Philosophos |accessdate=7 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716085840/http://www.philosophos.com/knowledge_base/archives_12/philosophy_questions_12.html |archive-date=16 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's thought cannot therefore be counted as idealist in the modern sense.

With the [[Neoplatonist]] [[Plotinus]], wrote Nathaniel Alfred Boll "there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], ''idealism'' that had long been current in the East even at that time, for it taught... that the soul has made the world by stepping from [[eternity]] into [[time]]...".&lt;ref&gt;'For there is for this universe no other place than the soul or mind'&lt;br&gt;''(neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima)''&lt;br&gt;''Enneads'', iii, lib. vii, c.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''(oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere)''&lt;br&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," § 7&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in regard to passages from the [[Enneads]], "The only space or place of the world is the soul" and "Time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul".&lt;ref&gt;''Enneads'', iii, 7, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig Noiré wrote: "For the first time in Western philosophy we find idealism proper in Plotinus".&lt;ref name="Noiré"&gt;Ludwig Noiré, ''Historical Introduction to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Plotinus does not address whether we know external objects,{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} unlike Schopenhauer and other modern philosophers.

==Christian philosophy==

==Chinese philosophy==
[[Wang Yangming]], a Ming Chinese neo-Confucian philosopher, official, educationist, calligraphist and general, held that objects do not exist entirely apart from the mind because the mind shapes them. It is not the world that shapes the mind but the mind that gives reason to the world, so the mind alone is the source of all reason, having an inner light, an innate moral goodness and understanding of what is good.

==Idealism in Vedic and Buddhist thought==
{{Asian philosophy sidebar}}
[[Image:Yajnavalkya_and_Janaka.jpg|thumb|240px|The sage [[Yajnavalkya]] (possibly 8th century) is one of the earliest exponents of idealism, and is a major figure in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]].]]
There are currents of idealism throughout [[Indian philosophy]], ancient and modern. Hindu idealism often takes the form of [[monism]] or [[non-dualism]], espousing the view that a unitary [[consciousness]] is the essence or meaning of the [[Maya (illusion)|phenomenal reality]] and plurality.

Buddhist idealism on the other hand is more epistemic and is not a metaphysical monism, which Buddhists consider eternalistic and hence not the [[middle way]] between extremes espoused by the Buddha.

The oldest reference to Idealism in Vedic texts is in [[Purusha Sukta]] of the [[Rig Veda]]. This sukta espouses [[panentheism]] by presenting cosmic being Purusha as both pervading all universe and yet being transcendent to it.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnananda, Swami. [http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/invoc/in_pura.html Daily Invocations]. Divine Life Society, The Purusha Sukta, Verses 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute idealism can be seen in [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]], where things of the objective world like the [[Mahābhūta|five elements]] and the subjective world such as will, hope, memory etc. are seen to be emanations from the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Self]].&lt;ref&gt;Nikhilananda, Swami. The Upanishads&amp;nbsp;— A New Translation. [http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/upanishads/chandogya_upanishad.php Chhandogya Upanishad], Parts 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian philosophy===
Idealist notions have been propounded by the [[Vedanta]] schools of thought, which use the Vedas, especially the [[Upanishads]] as their key texts. Idealism was opposed by dualists [[Samkhya]], the atomists [[Vaisheshika]], the logicians [[Nyaya]], the  linguists [[Mimamsa]] and the materialists [[Cārvāka]]. There are various sub schools of Vedanta, like [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dual), [[Vishishtadvaita]] and [[Bhedabheda]] Vedanta (difference and non-difference).

The schools of Vedanta all attempt to explain the nature and relationship of [[Brahman]] (universal soul or Self) and [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (individual self), which they see as the central topic of the Vedas. One of the earliest attempts at this was Bādarāyaņa's [[Brahma Sutras]], which is canonical for all Vedanta sub-schools. Advaita Vedanta is a major sub school of Vedanta which holds a non-dual Idealistic metaphysics. According to Advaita thinkers like [[Adi Shankara]] (788–820) and his contemporary [[Maṇḍana Miśra]], Brahman, the single unitary consciousness or absolute awareness, appears as the diversity of the world because of ''maya'' or illusion, and hence perception of plurality is ''mithya'', error. The world and all beings or souls in it have no separate existence from Brahman, universal consciousness, and the seemingly independent soul (''jiva'') is identical to Brahman. These doctrines are represented in verses such as ''brahma satyam jagan mithya; jīvo brahmaiva na aparah'' (Brahman is alone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman). Other forms of Vedanta like the [[Vishishtadvaita]] of [[Ramanuja]] and the [[Bhedabheda]] of [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhāskara]] are not as radical in their non-dualism, accepting that there is a certain difference between individual souls and Brahman. [[Dvaita]] school of [[Vedanta]] by [[Madhvacharya]] maintains the opposing view that the world is real and eternal. It also argues that real atman fully depends and reflection of independent brahman. 

The [[Yoga|Tantric]] tradition of [[Kashmir Shaivism]] has also been categorized by scholars as a form of Idealism.&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Dyczkowski, Mark. The Doctrine of Vibration: An Analysis of Doctrines and Practices of Kashmir Shaivism. P. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The key thinker of this tradition is the Kashmirian [[Abhinavagupta]] (975–1025 CE).

Modern Vedic Idealism was defended by the influential Indian philosopher [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] in his 1932 ''An Idealist View of Life'' and other works, which espouse [[Advaita Vedanta]]. The essence of Hindu Idealism is captured by such modern writers as [[Nisargadatta Maharaj|Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj]], [[Sri Aurobindo]], [[P. R. Sarkar]], and [[Sohail Inayatullah]].

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[File:Kofukuji Monastery Hosso Patriarchs of Hokuendo (Seshin) (413).jpg|thumb|Statue of Vasubandhu (jp. Seshin), [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], [[Japan]].]]
Buddhist views which can be said to be similar to Idealism appear in [[Mahayana]] Buddhist texts such as the [[Samdhinirmocana sutra]], [[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]], [[Ten Stages Sutra|Dashabhumika sutra]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;ernando Tola, Carmen Dragonetti. Philosophy of mind in the Yogacara Buddhist idealistic school. History of Psychiatry, SAGE Publications, 2005, 16 (4), pp.453-465.&lt;/ref&gt; These were later expanded upon by Indian Buddhist philosophers like [[Vasubandhu]], [[Asaṅga]], [[Dharmakīrti]], and [[Śāntarakṣita]]. Yogacara thought was also promoted in China, by Chinese philosophers and translators like [[Xuanzang]].

There is a modern scholarly disagreement about whether Yogacara Buddhism can be said to be a form of idealism. As Saam Trivedi notes: "on one side of the debate, writers such as Jay Garfield, Jeffrey Hopkins, Paul Williams, and others maintain the idealism label, while on the other side, Stefan Anacker, Dan Lusthaus, Richard King, Thomas Kochumuttom, Alex Wayman, Janice Dean Willis, and others have argued that Yogacara is not idealist."&lt;ref name="Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231"&gt;Trivedi, Saam; Idealism and Yogacara Buddhism. Asian Philosophy Vol. 15, No. 3, November 2005, pp. 231–246&lt;/ref&gt; The central point of issue is what Buddhist philosophers like [[Vasubandhu]] who used the term ''Vijñapti-matra'' (representation-only or cognition-only) and formulated arguments to refute external objects actually meant to say.

Vasubandhu's works include a refutation of external objects or externality itself and argues that the true nature of reality is beyond subject-object distinctions.&lt;ref name="Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231"/&gt; He views ordinary consciousness experience as deluded in its perceptions of an external world separate from itself and instead argues that all there is ''Vijñapti'' (representation or conceptualization).&lt;ref name="Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231"/&gt; Hence Vasubandhu begins his ''Vimsatika'' with the verse: ''All this is consciousness-only, because of the appearance of non-existent objects, just as someone with an optical disorder may see non-existent nets of hair.''&lt;ref name="Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231"/&gt;

Likewise, the Buddhist philosopher Dharmakirti's view of the apparent existence of external objects is summed up by him in the [[Pramanavarttika|Pramānaṿārttika]] (‘Commentary on Logic and Epistemology’): ''Cognition experiences itself, and nothing else whatsoever. Even the particular objects of perception, are by nature just consciousness itself.''&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. Buddhist Idealists and Their Jain Critics On Our Knowledge of External Objects.
Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement / Volume 74 / July 2014, pp 123 - 147
DOI: 10.1017/S1358246114000083, Published online: 30 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

While some writers like Jay Garfield hold that Vasubandhu is a metaphysical idealist, others see him as closer to an epistemic idealist like Kant who holds that our knowledge of the world is simply knowledge of our own concepts and perceptions of a transcendental world. Sean Butler upholding that Yogacara is a form of idealism, albeit its own unique type, notes the similarity of [[Category (Kant)|Kant's categories]] and Yogacara's ''[[Vāsanā]]s'', both of which are simply phenomenal tools with which the mind interprets the noumenal realm.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Idealism in Yogācāra Buddhism, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Kant however who holds that the noumenon or thing-in-itself is unknowable to us, Vasubandhu holds that ultimate reality is knowable, but only through non-conceptual yogic perception of a highly trained meditative mind.&lt;ref name="Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231"/&gt;

Writers like Dan Lusthaus who hold that Yogacara is not a metaphysical idealism point out, for example, that Yogācāra thinkers did not focus on consciousness to assert it as ontologically real, but simply to analyze how our experiences and thus our suffering is created. As Lusthaus notes: "no Indian Yogācāra text ever claims that the world is created by mind. What they do claim is that we mistake our projected interpretations of the world for the world itself, i.e. we take our own mental constructions to be the world."&lt;ref name="acmuller.net"&gt;[[Dan Lusthaus]], "What is and isn't Yogācāra." {{cite web|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216190312/http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |archivedate=16 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lusthaus notes that there are similarities to Western epistemic idealists like Kant and Husserl, enough so that Yogacara can be seen as a form of epistemological idealism. However he also notes key differences like the concepts of karma and nirvana.&lt;ref name="acmuller.net"/&gt; Saam Trivedi meanwhile notes the similarities between epistemic idealism and Yogacara, but adds that Yogacara Buddhism is in a sense its own theory.&lt;ref name="Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231"/&gt;

Similarly, Thomas Kochumuttom sees Yogacara as "an explanation of experience, rather than a system of ontology" and Stefan Anacker sees Vasubandhu's philosophy as a form of psychology and as a mainly therapeutic enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Kochumuttom, Thomas A. (1999), A buddhist Doctrine of Experience.

==Subjective idealism&lt;!--'Worst argument' redirects here--&gt;==
{{main|Subjective idealism}}
Subjective idealism ([[immaterialism]] or [[phenomenalism]]) describes a relationship between experience and the world in which objects are no more than collections or [[Bundle theory|bundles of sense data]] in the perceiver. Proponents include Berkeley,&lt;ref&gt;" Berkeley's version of Idealism is usually referred to as Subjective Idealism or Dogmatic Idealism" http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_idealism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop of Cloyne, an Anglo-Irish philosopher who advanced a theory he called "[[immaterialism]]," later referred to as "subjective idealism", contending that individuals can only know sensations and ideas of objects directly, not abstractions such as "matter", and that ideas also depend upon being perceived for their very existence - ''esse est percipi''; "to be is to be perceived".

[[Arthur Collier]]&lt;ref&gt;''Clavis Universalis, or A New Inquiry after Truth, being a Demonstration of the NonExistence or Impossibility of an External World'' by Arthur Collier&lt;/ref&gt; published similar assertions though there seems to have been no influence between the two contemporary writers. The only knowable reality is the represented image of an external object. Matter as a cause of that image, is unthinkable and therefore nothing to us. An external world as absolute matter unrelated to an observer does not exist as far as we are concerned. The universe cannot exist as it appears if there is no perceiving mind. Collier was influenced by ''An Essay Towards the Theory of the Ideal or Intelligible World'' by [[Cambridge Platonist]] [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] (1701).

[[Bertrand Russell]]'s popular book  ''[[The Problems of Philosophy]]'' highlights Berkeley's tautological premise for advancing idealism;

:"If we say that the things known must be in the mind, we are either unduly limiting the mind's power of knowing, or we are uttering a mere tautology. We are uttering a mere tautology if we mean by 'in the mind' the same as by 'before the mind', i.e. if we mean merely being apprehended by the mind. But if we mean this, we shall have to admit that what, in this sense, is in the mind, may nevertheless be not mental. Thus when we realize the nature of knowledge, Berkeley's argument is seen to be wrong in substance as well as in form, and his grounds for supposing that 'idea', i.e. the objects apprehended-must be mental, are found to have no validity whatever. Hence his grounds in favour of the idealism may be dismissed."

The [[Australians|Austrailian]] philosopher [[David Stove]] harshly criticized philosophical idealism, arguing that it rests on what he called "the '''worst argument'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/worst.html|title=Stove's discovery of the worst argument in the world|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stove claims that Berkeley tried to derive a non-tautological conclusion from tautological reasoning. He argued that in Berkeley's case the [[fallacy]] is not obvious and this is because one premise is ambiguous between one meaning which is [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] and another which, Stove argues, is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the conclusion.

[[Alan Musgrave]]&lt;ref&gt;Alan Musgrave, in an article titled ''Realism and Antirealism'' in R. Klee (ed), ''Scientific Inquiry: Readings in the Philosophy of Science'', Oxford, 1998, 344-352 - later re-titled to ''Conceptual Idealism and Stove's Gem'' in A. Musgrave, Essays on Realism and Rationalism, Rodopi, 1999 also in M.L. Dalla Chiara et al. (eds), ''Language, Quantum, Music'', Kluwer, 1999, 25-35 - [[Alan Musgrave]]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that conceptual idealists compound their mistakes with use/mention confusions;

:Santa Claus the person does not exist.
:"Santa Claus" the name/concept/fairy tale does exist because adults tell children this every Christmas season (the distinction is highlighted by using quotation-marks when referring only to the name and not the object)

and proliferation of hyphenated entities such as "thing-in-itself" (Immanuel Kant), "things-as-interacted-by-us" ([[Arthur Fine]]), "table-of-commonsense" and "table-of-physics" (Sir [[Arthur Eddington]]) which are "warning signs" for conceptual idealism according to Musgrave because they allegedly do not exist but only highlight the numerous ways in which people come to know the world. This argument does not take into account the issues pertaining to hermeneutics, especially at the backdrop of analytic philosophy. Musgrave criticized [[Richard Rorty]] and [[postmodernist]] philosophy in general for confusion of use and mention.

[[A. A. Luce]]&lt;ref&gt;Sense Without Matter Or Direct Perception By A.A. Luce&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Foster (philosopher)|John Foster]] are other subjectivists.&lt;ref&gt;Review for John Foster's book ''A World for Us: The Case for Phenomenalistic Idealism'' http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=15785&lt;/ref&gt; Luce, in ''Sense without Matter'' (1954), attempts to bring Berkeley up to date by modernizing his vocabulary and putting the issues he faced in modern terms, and treats the Biblical account of matter and the psychology of perception and nature. Foster's ''The Case for Idealism'' argues that the physical world is the logical creation of natural, non-logical constraints on human [[Empirical evidence|sense-experience]]. Foster's latest defense of his views ([[phenomenalistic idealism]]) is in his book ''A World for Us: The Case for Phenomenalistic Idealism''.

[[Paul Brunton]], a British philosopher, mystic, traveler, and guru, taught a type of idealism called "[[Mentalism (philosophy)|mentalism]]," similar to that of Bishop Berkeley, proposing a master world-image, projected or manifested by a world-mind, and an infinite number of individual minds participating. A tree does not cease to exist if nobody sees it because the world-mind is projecting the idea of the tree to all minds&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stillnessspeaks.com/images/uploaded/file/Paul%20Brunton.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Searle]], criticizing some versions of idealism, summarizes two important arguments for subjective idealism. The first is based on our perception of reality:

:(1) ''All we have access to in perception are the contents of our own experience'' and

:(2) ''The only epistemic basis for claims about the external world are our perceptual experiences''

therefore;

:(3) ''The only reality we can meaningfully speak of is that of perceptual experience&lt;ref&gt;[[John Searle]], ''The Construction of Social Reality'' p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst agreeing with (2) Searle argues that (1) is false and points out that (3) does not follow from (1) and (2). The second argument runs as follows;

:''Premise: Any cognitive state occurs as part of a set of cognitive states and within a cognitive system''

:''Conclusion 1: It is impossible to get outside all cognitive states and systems to survey the relationships between them and the reality they cognize''

:''Conclusion 2: There is no cognition of any reality that exists independently of cognition&lt;ref&gt;[[John Searle]], ''The Construction of Social Reality'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle contends that ''Conclusion 2'' does not follow from the premises.

[[Epistemological idealism]] is a subjectivist position in [[epistemology]] that holds that what one knows about an object exists only in one's mind. Proponents include [[Brand Blanshard]].

==Transcendental idealism==
{{main|Transcendental idealism}}
Transcendental idealism, founded by Immanuel Kant in the eighteenth century, maintains that the mind shapes the world we perceive into the form of space-and-time.

{{Quotation|...&amp;nbsp;if I remove the thinking subject, the whole material world must at once vanish because it is nothing but a phenomenal appearance in the sensibility of ourselves as a subject, and a manner or species of representation.|''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' A383}}

The 2nd edition (1787) contained a ''Refutation of Idealism'' to distinguish his transcendental idealism from [[Descartes]]'s [[Sceptic]]al Idealism and Berkeley's anti-realist strain of [[Subjective Idealism]]. The section ''Paralogisms of Pure Reason'' is an implicit critique of Descartes' idealism. Kant says that it is not possible to infer the 'I' as an object (Descartes' ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'') purely from "the spontaneity of thought". Kant focused on ideas drawn from British philosophers such as [[John Locke|Locke]], Berkeley and [[David Hume|Hume]] but distinguished his transcendental or [[critical idealism]] from previous varieties;

{{Quotation|The dictum of all genuine idealists, from the [[Eleatic]] school to Bishop Berkeley, is contained in this formula: “All knowledge through the [[senses]] and [[experience]] is nothing but sheer [[illusion]], and only in the ideas of the pure [[understanding]] and [[reason]] is there [[truth]].” The principle that throughout dominates and determines my [transcendental] idealism is, on the contrary: “All knowledge of things merely from pure understanding or pure reason is nothing but sheer illusion, and only in experience is there truth.”|''[[Prolegomena]]'', 374}}

Kant distinguished between things as they appear to an observer and things in themselves, "that is, things considered without regard to whether and how they may be given to us".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 140&lt;/ref&gt;  We cannot approach the ''[[noumenon]]'', the "thing in Itself" ({{lang-de|Ding an sich}}) without our own mental world. He added that the mind is not a [[blank slate]], ''tabula rasa'' but rather comes equipped with categories for organising our sense impressions.

In the first volume of his ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Schopenhauer wrote his "Sketch of a [[History]] of the Doctrine of the [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideal]] and the [[The Real|Real]]". He defined the ideal as being mental pictures that constitute subjective [[knowledge]]. The ideal, for him, is what can be attributed to our own minds. The images in our head are what comprise the ideal. Schopenhauer emphasized that we are restricted to our own [[consciousness]]. The [[world]] that appears is only a [[representation (psychology)|representation]] or mental picture of objects. We directly and immediately know only representations. All objects that are external to the mind are known indirectly through the mediation of our mind. He offered a history of the [[concept]] of the "ideal" as "ideational" or "existing in the mind as an image".

{{Quotation|[T]rue philosophy must at all costs be ''idealistic''; indeed, it must be so merely to be honest. For nothing is more certain than that no one ever came out of himself in order to identify himself immediately with things different from him; but everything of which he has certain, sure, and therefore immediate knowledge, lies within his consciousness. Beyond this consciousness, therefore, there can be no ''immediate'' certainty ... There can never be an existence that is objective absolutely and in itself; such an existence, indeed, is positively inconceivable. For the objective, as such, always and essentially has its existence in the consciousness of a subject; it is therefore the subject's representation, and consequently is conditioned by the subject, and moreover by the subject's forms of representation, which belong to the subject and not to the object.|''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Ch. 1}}

[[Charles Bernard Renouvier]] was the first Frenchman after Nicolas Malebranche to formulate a complete idealistic system, and had a vast influence on the development of French thought. His system is based on Immanuel Kant's, as his chosen term "néo-criticisme" indicates; but it is a transformation rather than a continuation of Kantianism.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that Kant commits an agnostic [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] and does not offer a satisfactory answer as to the ''source'' of a philosophical right to such-or-other metaphysical claims; he ridicules his pride in tackling "the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, ''Beyond Good and Evil'', Part 1 On the Prejudice of Philosophers Section 11; cf. ''On the Genealogy of Morals'', book III, 25, the last paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous "thing-in-itself" was called a product of philosophical habit, which seeks to introduce a grammatical subject: because wherever there is cognition, there must be a ''thing'' that is cognized and allegedly it must be added to ontology as a being (whereas, to Nietzsche, only the world as ever changing appearances can be assumed).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. ''The Will To Power'', 552. [https://archive.org/stream/TheWillToPower-Nietzsche/will_to_power-nietzsche_djvu.txt Online text here]. "At last, the &amp;laquo;thing-in-itself&amp;raquo; also disappears, because this is fundamentally the conception of a &amp;laquo;subject-in-itself&amp;raquo;. But we have grasped that the subject is a fiction. The antithesis &amp;laquo;thing-in-itself&amp;raquo; and &amp;laquo;appearance&amp;raquo; is untenable; with that, however, the concept &amp;laquo;appearance&amp;raquo; also disappears."&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he attacks the idealism of Schopenhauer and [[Descartes]] with an argument similar to Kant's critique of the latter ''(see above)''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. ''The Will To Power'', 477. [https://archive.org/stream/TheWillToPower-Nietzsche/will_to_power-nietzsche_djvu.txt Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective idealism==
{{main|Objective idealism}}
Objective idealism asserts that the reality of experiencing combines and transcends the realities of the object experienced and of the mind of the observer.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary definition http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/objective+idealism&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents include [[Thomas Hill Green]], [[Josiah Royce]], [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_idealism.html|title=Idealism - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolute idealism===
{{main|Absolute idealism}}

Schelling (1775–1854) claimed that the Fichte's "I" needs the Not-I, because there is no subject without object, and vice versa. So there is no difference between the subjective and the objective, that is, the ideal and the real. This is Schelling's "absolute [[identity (philosophy)|identity]]": the [[idea]]s or mental images in the mind are identical to the extended objects which are external to the mind.

Absolute idealism is G. W. F. Hegel's account of how existence is comprehensible as an all-inclusive whole. Hegel called his philosophy "absolute" idealism in contrast to the "subjective idealism" of Berkeley and the "transcendental idealism" of Kant and Fichte,&lt;ref&gt;One book devoted to showing that Hegel is neither a Berkeleyan nor a Kantian idealist is Kenneth Westphal, ''Hegel's Epistemological Realism'' (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; which were not based on a critique of the finite and a dialectical philosophy of history as Hegel's idealism was. The exercise of reason and intellect enables the philosopher to know ultimate historical reality, the phenomenological constitution of self-determination, the dialectical development of self-awareness and personality in the realm of History.

In his ''Science of Logic'' (1812–1814) Hegel argues that finite qualities are not fully "real" because they depend on other finite qualities to determine them. Qualitative ''infinity'', on the other hand, would be more self-determining and hence more fully real. Similarly finite natural things are less "real"—because they are less self-determining—than spiritual things like morally responsible people, ethical communities and God. So any doctrine, such as materialism, that asserts that finite qualities or natural objects are fully real is mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;An interpretation of Hegel's critique of the finite, and of the "absolute idealism" which Hegel appears to base that critique, is found in Robert M. Wallace, Hegel's Philosophy of Reality, Freedom, and God, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations.&lt;ref&gt;See Wallace, ''Hegel's Philosophy of Reality, Freedom, and God'', chapter 3, for details on how Hegel might preserve something resembling Kant's dualism of nature and freedom while defending it against skeptical attack.&lt;/ref&gt; For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the "subject" (any human observer) to be able to know any observed "object" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of "subject-object identity," subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural "God") as their ''conceptual'' (not metaphysical) inner reality—and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's "self-realization" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to ''Absolute'' Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every "object" it observes is something "alien," meaning something separate or apart from "subject."  In Hegel's words, "The object is revealed to it [to "subject"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself."&lt;ref&gt;G. W. F. Hegel, ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', trans. A. V. Miller (Oxford: Clarendon, 1977), para. 771; cf. para. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every "object" is ''himself'', because both subject and object are essentially Spirit.  When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes ''Absolute'' Spirit, the "finite" (man, human) becomes the "infinite" ("God," divine), replacing the imaginary or "picture-thinking" supernatural God of [[theism]]: man becomes God.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard F. Wheat, ''Hegel's Undiscovered Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis Dialectics: What Only Marx and Tillich Understood'' (Amherst, NY: Prometheus, 2012), 69, 105-106, 116, 158-59, 160, 291, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker puts it this way: "Hegelianism . . . is a religion  of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'" The picture Hegel presents is "a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tucker, ''Philosophy and Myth in Karl Marx'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961), 43, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] criticized Hegel's idealist philosophy in several of his works, particularly his claim to a comprehensive system that could explain the whole of reality. Where Hegel argues that an ultimate understanding of the logical structure of the world is an understanding of the logical structure of [[God]]'s mind, Kierkegaard asserts that for God reality can be a system but it cannot be so for any human individual because both reality and humans are incomplete and all philosophical systems imply completeness. A [[logical system]] is possible but an existential system is not. "What is rational is actual; and what is actual is rational".&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'' (1821)&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel's absolute idealism blurs the distinction between existence and thought: our mortal nature places limits on our understanding of reality;

&lt;blockquote&gt;So-called systems have often been characterized and challenged in the assertion that they abrogate the distinction between good and evil, and destroy freedom. Perhaps one would express oneself quite as definitely, if one said that every such system fantastically dissipates the concept existence. ... Being an individual man is a thing that has been abolished, and every speculative philosopher confuses himself with humanity at large; whereby he becomes something infinitely great, and at the same time nothing at all.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'' (1846)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A major concern of Hegel's ''Phenomenology of Spirit'' (1807) and of the philosophy of Spirit that he lays out in his ''Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences'' (1817–1830) is the interrelation between individual humans, which he conceives in terms of "mutual recognition." However, what Climacus means by the aforementioned statement, is that Hegel, in the ''Philosophy of Right'', believed the best solution was to surrender one's individuality to the customs of the State, identifying right and wrong in view of the prevailing bourgeois morality. Individual human will ought, at the State's highest level of development, to properly coincide with the will of the State. Climacus rejects Hegel's suppression of individuality by pointing out it is impossible to create a valid set of rules or system in any society which can adequately describe existence for any one individual. Submitting one's will to the State denies personal freedom, choice, and responsibility.

In addition, Hegel does believe we can know the structure of God's mind, or ultimate reality. Hegel agrees with Kierkegaard that both reality and humans are incomplete, inasmuch as we are in time, and reality develops through time. But the relation between time and eternity is outside time and this is the "logical structure" that Hegel thinks we can know. Kierkegaard disputes this assertion, because it eliminates the clear distinction between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. Existence and thought are not identical and one cannot possibly think existence. Thought is always a form of abstraction, and thus not only is pure existence impossible to think, but all forms in existence are unthinkable; thought depends on language, which merely abstracts from experience, thus separating us from lived experience and the living essence of all beings. In addition, because we are finite beings, we cannot possibly know or understand anything that is universal or infinite such as God, so we cannot know God exists, since that which transcends time simultaneously transcends human understanding.

Bradley saw reality as a [[monism|monistic]] whole apprehended through "feeling", a state in which there is no distinction between the perception and the thing perceived. Like Berkeley, Bradley thought that nothing can be known to exist unless it is known by a mind.

{{Quotation|We perceive, on reflection, that to be real, or even barely to exist, must be to fall within sentience ... . Find any piece of existence, take up anything that any one could possibly call a fact, or could in any sense assert to have being, and then judge if it does not consist in sentient experience. Try to discover any sense in which you can still continue to speak of it, when all perception and feeling have been removed; or point out any fragment of its matter, any aspect of its being, which is not derived from and is not still relative to this source. When the experiment is made strictly, I can myself conceive of nothing else than the experienced.|F.H. Bradley|''Appearance and Reality''|Chapter 14}}

Bradley was the apparent target of [[G. E. Moore]]'s radical rejection of idealism. Moore claimed that Bradley did not understand the statement that something is real. We know for certain, through common sense and prephilosophical beliefs, that some things are real, whether they are objects of thought or not, according to Moore. The 1903 article ''The Refutation of Idealism'' is one of the first demonstrations of Moore's commitment to analysis. He examines each of the three terms in the Berkeleian aphorism ''esse est percipi'', "to be is to be perceived", finding that it must mean that the object and the subject are ''necessarily'' connected so that "yellow" and "the sensation of yellow" are identical - "to be yellow" is "to be experienced as yellow". But it also seems there is a difference between "yellow" and "the sensation of yellow" and "that ''esse'' is held to be ''percipi'', solely because what is experienced is held to be identical with the experience of it". Though far from a complete refutation, this was the first strong statement by analytic philosophy against its idealist predecessors, or at any rate against the type of idealism represented by Berkeley.

===Actual idealism===
[[Actual idealism]] is a form of idealism developed by [[Giovanni Gentile]] that grew into a "grounded" idealism contrasting Kant and Hegel. The idea is a version of Occam's razor; the simpler explanations are always correct. Actual idealism is the idea that reality is the ongoing act of thinking, or in Italian "pensiero pensante".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peters, R. |year=2006 |title=On Presence: "Actes De Presence": Presence in Fascist Political Culture |journal=History &amp; Theory |volume=45 |number=3 |pages=362–374 |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/search/basic?sid=138f85e9-3bd6-470d-93cbc8aa68e8f20e%40sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any action done by humans is classified as human thought because the action was done due to predisposed thought. He further believes that thoughts are the only concept that truly exist since reality is defined through the act of thinking. This idea was derived from Gentile's paper, "The Theory of Mind As Pure Act".&lt;ref name="rightscholarship.wordpress.com"&gt;Right Thinkers #7: Giovanni Gentile (1875-1944). (2014, July 1). Retrieved February 12, 2017, from Right Scholarship https://rightscholarship.wordpress.com/tag/idealism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since thoughts are actions, any conjectured idea can be enacted. This idea not only affects the individual's life, but everyone around them, which in turn affects the state since the people are the state.&lt;ref name="papermasters.com"&gt;Custom Research Papers on Actual Idealism. (n.d.). Retrieved February 11, 2017, from https://www.papermasters.com/actual-idealism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, thoughts of each person are subsumed within the state. The state is a composition of many minds that come together to change the country for better or worse.

Gentile theorizes that thoughts can only be conjectured within the bounds of known reality; abstract thinking does not exist.&lt;ref name="rightscholarship.wordpress.com"/&gt; Thoughts cannot be formed outside our known reality because we are the reality that halt ourselves from thinking externally. With accordance to "The Act of Thought of Pure Thought", our actions comprise our thoughts, our thoughts create perception, perceptions define reality, thus we think within our created reality.

The present act of thought is reality but the past is not reality; it is history. The reason being, past can be rewritten through present knowledge and perspective of the event. The reality that is currently constructed can be completely changed through language (e.g. bias (omission, source, tone)).&lt;ref name="papermasters.com"/&gt; The unreliability of the recorded realty can skew the original concept and make the past remark unreliable. 
Actual idealism is regarded as a liberal and tolerant doctrine since it acknowledges that every being picturizes reality, in which their ideas remained hatched, differently. Even though, reality is a figment of thought.

Even though core concept of the theory is famous for its simplification, its application is regarded as extremely ambiguous. Over the years, philosophers have interpreted it numerously different ways:&lt;ref&gt;Peters, R. (2006). On Presence: "Actes De Presence": Presence in Fascist Political Culture. History &amp; Theory, 45(3), 362-374. Retrieved from http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/search/basic?sid=138f85e9-3bd6-470d-93cbc8aa68e8f20e%40sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4104&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes took it as metaphysics of the thinking act; Betti as a form of hermeneutics; Harris as a metaphysics of democracy; Fogu as a modernist philosophy of history.

Giovanni Gentile was a key supporter of fascism, regarded by many as the "philosopher of fascism". Gentile's philosophy was the key to understating fascism as it was believed by many who supported and loved it. They believed, if priori synthesis of subject and object is true, there is no difference between the individuals in society; they're all one. Which means that they have equal right, roles, and jobs. In fascist state, submission is given to one leader because individuals act as one body. In Gentile's view, far more can be accomplished when individuals are under a corporate body than a collection of autonomous individual.&lt;ref name="papermasters.com"/&gt;

===Pluralistic idealism&lt;!--'Plurastic idealism' redirects here--&gt;===
'''Pluralistic idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; such as that of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Blamauer (ed.), ''The Mental as Fundamental: New Perspectives on Panpsychism'', Walter de Gruyter, 2013, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~msharlow/idealism.htm "About Idealism"]&lt;/ref&gt; takes the view that there are many individual minds that together underlie the existence of the observed world and make possible the existence of the physical universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~msharlow/idealism.htm|title=Metaphysical Idealism|website=www.eskimo.com|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike absolute idealism, pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence of a single ultimate mental reality or "Absolute". Leibniz' form of idealism, known as [[Panpsychism]], views "monads" as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception. The monads are "substantial forms of being, "elemental, individual, subject to their own laws, non-interacting, each reflecting the entire universe. Monads are centers of force, which is [[Substance theory|substance]] while space, matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads. There is a [[pre-established harmony]] by [[God]], the central monad, between the world in the minds of the [[Monadology|monad]]s and the external world of objects. Leibniz's cosmology embraced traditional Christian [[theism]]. The English psychologist and philosopher [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]] inspired by Leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Cambridge Modern History: The era of violence, 1898-1945, edited by David Thomson'' University Press, 1960, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ward the universe is composed of "psychic monads" of different levels, interacting for mutual self-betterment.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Joseph Tallon The concept of self in British and American idealism 1939, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personalism]] is the view that the minds that underlie reality are the minds of persons. [[Borden Parker Bowne]], a philosopher at Boston University, a founder and popularizer of personal idealism, presented it as a substantive reality of persons, the only reality, as known directly in self-consciousness. Reality is a society of interacting persons dependent on the Supreme Person of God. Other proponents include [[George Holmes Howison]]&lt;ref&gt;The Limits Of Evolution; And Other Essays Illustrating The Metaphysical Theory Of Personal Idealism By George Holmes Howison&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[J. M. E. McTaggart]].&lt;ref&gt;See the book Idealistic Argument in Recent British and American Philosophy By Gustavus W Cunningham page 202 "Ontologically i am an idealist, since i believe that all that exists is spiritual. I am also, in one sense of the term, a Personal Idealist."&lt;/ref&gt;

Howison's personal idealism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howison.us/george_holmes_howison.htm |title=George Holmes Howison |publisher=Howison.us |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707190718/http://www.howison.us/george_holmes_howison.htm |archivedate=7 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was also called "California Personalism" by others to distinguish it from the "Boston Personalism" which was of Bowne. Howison maintained that both impersonal, monistic idealism and materialism run contrary to the experience of moral freedom. To deny freedom to pursue truth, beauty, and "benignant love" is to undermine every profound human venture, including science, morality, and philosophy. Personalistic idealists Borden Parker Bowne and [[Edgar S. Brightman]] and realistic personal theist [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] address a core issue, namely that of dependence upon an infinite personal God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/howison-george-holmes-18341916-eoph/ |title=Research &amp; Articles on Howison, George Holmes (1834–1916) by |publisher=BookRags.com |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howison, in his book ''The Limits of Evolution and Other Essays Illustrating the Metaphysical Theory of Personal Idealism'', created a democratic notion of personal idealism that extended all the way to God, who was no more the ultimate monarch but the ultimate democrat in eternal relation to other eternal persons. J. M. E. McTaggart's idealist atheism and [[Thomas Davidson (philosopher)|Thomas Davidson]]'s Apeirionism resemble Howisons personal idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/209478|title=George Holmes Howison: &amp;quot;The City of God&amp;quot; and Personal Idealism|first=James.|last=McLachlan|publisher=|volume=20|issue=3|pages=224–242|doi=10.1353/jsp.2007.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. M. E. McTaggart]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] argued that minds alone exist and only relate to each other through love. [[Space]], [[time]] and material objects are unreal. In ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'' he argued that time is an illusion because it is impossible to produce a coherent account of a sequence of events. ''The Nature of Existence'' (1927) contained his arguments that space, time, and matter cannot possibly be real. In his ''Studies in Hegelian Cosmology'' (Cambridge, 1901, p196) he declared that metaphysics are not relevant to social and political action. McTaggart "thought that Hegel was wrong in supposing that metaphysics could show that the state is more than a means to the good of the individuals who compose it".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 3, "Idealism," New York, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; For McTaggart "philosophy can give us very little, if any, guidance in action... Why should a Hegelian citizen be surprised that his belief as to the organic nature of the Absolute does not help him in deciding how to vote? Would a Hegelian engineer be reasonable in expecting that his belief that all matter is spirit should help him in planning a bridge?&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in Hegelian Cosmology'' ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Davidson taught a philosophy called "[[apeirotheism]]", a "form of pluralistic idealism...coupled with a stern ethical rigorism"&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Bakewell, "Thomas Davidson," Dictionary of American Biography, gen. ed. Dumas Malone (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1932), 96.&lt;/ref&gt; which he defined as "a theory of Gods infinite in number." The theory was indebted to [[Aristotle]]'s pluralism and his concepts of Soul, the rational, living aspect of a living substance which cannot exist apart from the body because it is not a substance but an essence, and ''[[nous]]'', rational thought, reflection and understanding. Although a perennial source of controversy, Aristotle arguably views the latter as both eternal and immaterial in nature, as exemplified in his theology of [[unmoved movers]].&lt;ref name="Gerson"&gt;{{cite book |first=Lloyd P. |last=Gerson |title=The Unity of Intellect in Aristotle's "De Anima" |journal=Phronesis |volume=49 |number=4 |year=2004 |pages=348–373 |url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/lpgerson/The_Unity_Of_Intellect_In_Aristotles_De_Anima.pdf |jstor=4182761 |quote=Desperately difficult texts inevitably elicit desperate hermeneutical measures. Aristotle's ''De Anima,'' book three, chapter five, is evidently one such text. At least since the time of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], scholars have felt compelled to draw some remarkable conclusions regarding Aristotle's brief remarks in this passage regarding intellect. One such claim is that in chapter five, Aristotle introduces a second intellect, the so-called 'agent intellect', an intellect distinct from the 'passive intellect', the supposed focus of discussion up until this passage. This view is a direct descendent of the view of Alexander himself, who identified the agent intellect with the divine intellect. Even the staunchest defender of such a view is typically at a loss to give a plausible explanation of why the divine intellect pops into and then out of the picture in the intense and closely argued discussion of the human intellect that goes from chapter four through to the end of chapter seven.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying Aristotle's God with rational thought, Davidson argued, contrary to Aristotle, that just as the soul cannot exist apart from the body, God cannot exist apart from the world.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Journal, 1884-1898 (Thomas Davidson Collection, Manuscript Group #169, Sterling Memorial Library, Yale University). Quoted in DeArmey, "Thomas Davidson's Apeirotheism," 692&lt;/ref&gt;

Idealist notions took a strong hold among physicists of the early 20th century confronted with the paradoxes of [[quantum physics]] and the [[theory of relativity]]. In ''[[The Grammar of Science]]'', Preface to the 2nd Edition, 1900, [[Karl Pearson]] wrote, "There are many signs that a sound idealism is surely replacing, as a basis for natural philosophy, the crude [[materialism]] of the older physicists." This book influenced [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s regard for the importance of the observer in scientific measurements{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. In § 5 of that book, Pearson asserted that "...science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind...." Also, "...the field of science is much more [[consciousness]] than an external world."

Sir [[Arthur Eddington]], a British astrophysicist of the early 20th century, wrote in his book ''The Nature of the Physical World'' that "The stuff of the world is mind-stuff": &lt;blockquote&gt;The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds.... The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it.... It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness.... Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature.... It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character. But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference."&lt;ref&gt;A.S. Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', page 276-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:James Hopwood Jeans.jpg|thumb|240px|The 20th-century British scientist Sir [[James Hopwood Jeans|James Jeans]] wrote that "the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine"]]
[[Ian Barbour]] in his book ''Issues in Science and Religion'' (1966), p. 133, cites Arthur Eddington's ''The Nature of the Physical World'' (1928) for a text that argues The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles provides a scientific basis for "the defense of the idea of human freedom" and his ''Science and the Unseen World'' (1929) for support of philosophical idealism "the thesis that reality is basically mental".

[[Sir James Jeans]] wrote: "The stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter... we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter."&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans, ''The mysterious universe'', page 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeans, in an interview published in [[The Observer]] (London), when asked the question: "Do you believe that life on this planet is the result of some sort of accident, or do you believe that it is a part of some great scheme?" replied: &lt;blockquote&gt;I incline to the idealistic theory that consciousness is fundamental, and that the material universe is derivative from consciousness, not consciousness from the material universe... In general the universe seems to me to be nearer to a great thought than to a great machine. It may well be, it seems to me, that each individual consciousness ought to be compared to a brain-cell in a universal mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Addressing the [[British Association]] in 1934, Jeans said: &lt;blockquote&gt;What remains is in any case very different from the full-blooded matter and the forbidding [[materialism]] of the Victorian scientist. His objective and material universe is proved to consist of little more than constructs of our own minds. To this extent, then, modern physics has moved in the direction of philosophic idealism. Mind and matter, if not proved to be of similar nature, are at least found to be ingredients of one single system. There is no longer room for the kind of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] which has haunted philosophy since the days of [[Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans addressing the [[British Association]] in 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Universe Around Us'', Jeans writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Finite picture whose dimensions are a certain amount of space and a certain amount of time; the protons and electrons are the streaks of paint which define the picture against its space-time background. Traveling as far back in time as we can, brings us not to the creation of the picture, but to its edge; the creation of the picture lies as much outside the picture as the artist is outside his canvas. On this view, discussing the creation of the universe in terms of time and space is like trying to discover the artist and the action of painting, by going to the edge of the canvas. This brings us very near to those philosophical systems which regard the universe as a thought in the mind of its Creator, thereby reducing all discussion of material creation to futility.&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans ''The Universe Around Us'' page 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The chemist [[Ernest Lester Smith]] wrote a book ''Intelligence Came First'' (1975) in which he claimed that consciousness is a fact of nature and that the cosmos is grounded in and pervaded by mind and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Lester Smith''Intelligence Came First'' Quest Books, 1990 {{ISBN|0-8356-0657-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard d'Espagnat]], a French theoretical physicist best known for his work on the nature of reality, wrote a paper titled ''The Quantum Theory and Reality''. According to the paper:  &lt;blockquote&gt;The doctrine that the world is made up of objects whose existence is independent of human consciousness turns out to be in conflict with quantum mechanics and with facts established by experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/media/pdf/197911_0158.pdf "The Quantum Theory and Reality"] (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article entitled "Quantum Weirdness: What We Call 'Reality' is Just a State of Mind",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/mar/17/templeton-quantum-entanglement "Quantum weirdness: What We Call 'Reality' is Just a State of Mind"] (20 March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; d'Espagnat wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;What quantum mechanics tells us, I believe, is surprising to say the least. It tells us that the basic components of objects – the particles, electrons, quarks etc. – cannot be thought of as 'self-existent'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He further writes that his research in [[quantum physics]] has led him to conclude that an "ultimate reality" exists, which is not embedded in space or time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=d'Espagnat|first=Bernard|title=Quantum weirdness: What We Call 'Reality' is Just a State of Mind|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/mar/17/templeton-quantum-entanglement|newspaper=Guardian|date=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Murray v. United States]]'' provided the current independent source doctrine rule.

{{Arminianism}}

'''Jacobus Arminius''', (October 10, 1560 – October 19, 1609), the [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinized]] name of '''Jakob Hermanszoon''',{{Efn | Also known as '''Jakob Herman''' and the [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] names of '''Jacob Arminius''' and '''James Arminius'''.}} was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Christian theology|theologian]] from the [[Protestant Reformation]] period whose views became the basis of [[Arminianism]] and the Dutch [[Remonstrant]] movement.  He served from 1603 as professor in theology at the [[University of Leiden]] and wrote many books and treatises on theology.

Following his death, his challenge to the [[Reformed]] standard, the [[Belgic Confession]], provoked ample discussion at the [[Synod of Dort]], which crafted the [[five points of Calvinism]] in response to Arminius's teaching.

== Early life ==
Arminius, born in [[Oudewater]], [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], became an orphan while still young. His father Herman died, leaving his wife a widow with small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bangs | first = Carl | title = Arminius: A Study in the Dutch Reformation | publisher = Asbury Press | location = Grand Rapids | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-310-29481-9 | page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was killed during the [[Siege of Oudewater (1575)|Spanish massacre at Oudewater]] in 1575.

The pastor Theodorus Aemilius adopted Arminius and sent him to school in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], but died in 1574. Then [[Rudolph Snellius]] brought Arminius to [[Marburg]] and enabled him to study theology at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;ref name=AAE&gt;{{Citation | first = Marijke | last = Meij-Tolsma | title = Arminius, Arminianism, and Europe: Jacobus Arminius (1559/60–1609) | year = 2009 | chapter = Introduction | pages = ix–xvi | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Fw8Ja1h8l0gC&amp;pg=PR9 | format = Google Books| isbn = 9004178872 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological studies and ministry==
Arminius remained a student at Leiden from 1576 to 1582.  Although he enrolled as a student in Liberal Arts, this allowed him to pursue an education in theology, as well.  His teachers in theology included Calvinist [[Lambertus Danaeus]], Hebrew scholar [[Johannes Drusius]], Guillaume Feuguereius (or Feugueires, d. 1613), and Johann Kolmann.  Kolmann is now known for teaching that the overemphasis of God's sovereignty in high [[Calvinism]] made God "a tyrant and an executioner".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', (1930), page 386&lt;/ref&gt; Although the university in Leiden was solidly Reformed, it had influences from Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Anabaptist views in addition to Calvinism. One Leiden pastor ([[Caspar Coolhaes]]) held, ''contra'' Calvin, that civil authorities did have jurisdiction in some church affairs, that it was wrong to punish and execute heretics, and that Lutherans, Calvinists, and Anabaptists could unite around core tenets.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopædia Britannica 1911 Page 576"&gt;''The Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1911), Page 576&lt;/ref&gt;  The astronomer and mathematician [[Willebrord Snellius]] used Ramist philosophy in an effort to encourage his students to pursue truth without over reliance on Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica, Volume 2'' (1956), page 386&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of these men, Arminius studied with success and may have had seeds planted that would begin to develop into a theology that would later question the dominant Reformed theology of [[John Calvin]]. The success he showed in his studies motivated the merchants guild of Amsterdam to fund the next three years of his studies.

In 1582, Arminius began studying under [[Theodore Beza]] at Geneva. He found himself under pressure for using [[Ramism|Ramist]] philosophical methods, familiar to him from his time at Leiden.  Arminius was publicly forbidden to teach Ramean philosophy.  After this difficult state of affairs, he moved to [[Basel]] to continue his studies.&lt;ref name=AAE /&gt; He continued to distinguish himself there as an excellent student.  In 1583 Arminius was contemplating a return to Geneva when the theological faculty at Basel spontaneously offered him a doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of James Arminius'', Kasper Brant, (1854), Page 25&lt;/ref&gt; He declined the honor on account of his youth (he was about 24)&lt;ref name="Grace, Faith page 5"&gt;''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', By Robert E. Picirilli, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to the school in Geneva to finish his schooling in Geneva under Beza.

===Commendations from Beza and Grynaeus===
Upon the conclusion of Arminius' studies and a request for him to pastor in Amsterdam, Beza replied to leaders in Amsterdam with this letter:

''"...Let it be known to you that from the time Arminius returned to us from Basel, his life and learning both have so approved themselves to us, that we hope the best of him in every respect, if he steadily persists in the same course, which, by the blessing of God, we doubt not he will; for, among other endowments, God has gifted him with an apt intellect both as respects the apprehension and the discrimination of things. If this henceforward be regulated by piety, which he appears assiduously to cultivate, it cannot but happen that this power of intellect, when consolidated by mature age and experience, will be productive of the richest fruits. Such is our opinion of Arminius ---a young man, unquestionably, so far as we are able to judge, most worthy of your kindness and liberality" (Letter of June 3, 1585, from Beza to Amsterdam).''&lt;ref name="Grace, Faith page 5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of James Arminius'', Kasper Brant, (1854), Page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

From this letter it would seem that the earlier tension from Arminius' attraction to Ramist philosophy had dissipated and Arminius was known even to Beza as an excellent though budding theologian. Three months later, [[John Grynaeus]] at the University of Basel sent this letter of commendation:

'' "To pious readers, greeting: 'Inasmuch as a faithful testimonial of learning and piety ought not to be refused to any learned and pious man, so neither to James Arminius, a native of Amsterdam [sic], for his deportment while he attended the University of Basle was marked by piety, moderation, and assiduity in study ; and very often, in the course of our theological discussions, he made his gift of a discerning spirit so manifest to all of us, as to elicit from us well-merited congratulations. More recently, too, in certain extraordinary prelections delivered with the consent, and by the order, of the Theological Faculty, in which he publicly expounded a few chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, he gave us the best ground to hope that he was destined erelong — if, indeed, he goes on to stir up the gift of God that is in him — to undertake and sustain the function of teaching, to which he may be lawfully set apart, with much fruit to the Church. I commend him, accordingly, to all good men, and, in particular, to the Church of God in the famous city of Amsterdam ; and I respectfully entreat that regard may be had to that learned and pious youth, so that he may never be under the necessity of intermitting theological studies which have been thus far so happily prosecuted. Farewell ! 'John James Grynaeus, ' Professor of Sacred Literature, and Dean of the Theological Faculty. — Written with mine own hand. Basle, 3rd September, 1583.' ''

===Beginning of public ministry===
Arminius answered the call to pastor at [[Amsterdam]] in 1587, delivering Sunday and midweek sermons. After being tested by the church leaders, he was [[ordination|ordained]] in 1588. He gained a reputation as a good preacher and faithful pastor.

One of Arminius' first tasks was given to him by Ecclesiastical Court of Amsterdam; namely, to refute the teachings of [[Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert]], who rejected the Beza's [[supralapsarian]] doctrine of God's absolute and unconditional decree to create men so as to save some and damn others, based on nothing in themselves.  The discussion had already begun with two ministers at [[Delft]] who had written "''An Answer to certain Arguments of Beza and Calvin, from a Treatise on Predestination as taught in the Ninth Chapter of Romans''" a document which contradicted both Beza and Coorhert. They proposed that although God's decree to save only some was indeed absolute and unconditional, it had occurred after the fall (proposing [[infralapsarianism]] rather than Beza's [[supralapsarianism]]).  Arminius was tasked with refuting both Coorhert and infralapsarianism theology.  He readily agreed to the task, but after greater study found himself in conflict over the matter.  He determined to spend greater time in study before continuing his refutation.

In 1590 he married Lijsbet Reael. He was commissioned to organize the educational system of Amsterdam, and is said to have done it well.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopædia Britannica 1911 Page 576"/&gt; He greatly distinguished himself by faithfulness to his duties in 1602 during a plague that swept through Amsterdam,&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; going into infected houses that others did not dare to enter in order to give them water, and supplying their neighbors with funds to care for them.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of James Arminius'', Kasper Brant, (1854), Page 91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
At Amsterdam, Arminius taught through "a number of sermons on the Epistle of the Romans."  In discussing Romans 7 in 1591, he taught that man, through grace and rebirth, did not have to live in bondage to sin, and that Romans 7:14 was speaking of a man living under the law and convicted of sin by the Holy Spirit, yet not presently regenerated.  This was met with some resistance, and some detractors labeled him [[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] for teaching that an unregenerate man could feel such conviction and desire for salvation, even with the influence of the Law and the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of James Arminius'', Kasper Brant, (1854), Page 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, responding to Arminius' theological positions, his colleague [[Petrus Plancius]] began to openly dispute him. During a gathering of ministers, Arminius insisted he was not teaching anything in contradiction to the Heidelberg Confession and other standards of orthodoxy, that early church theologians held similar views, and that he utterly repudiated the heresy of Pelagianism. Further, Arminius expressed some astonishment that he was not to be allowed to interpret this passage according to the dictates of his own conscience and within the pattern of historic orthodoxy. The Amsterdam [[burgomaster]]s intervened, in an effort to keep the peace and tamp down divisions in the populace, urging them to peacefully coexist and for Arminius to teach nothing out of accord with the Reformed thought agreed upon at the time unless he had consulted with the church council or other bodies.{{Sfn | Israel | 1995 | p = 374}}

During the following years, controversy emerged as he preached through Romans 9.  Although he did not directly contradict Calvinist interpretations, he focused on Paul's theme of "justification by faith" in contradiction to works, rather than focusing on God's eternal decrees.  During this time he "gradually developed opinions on grace, predestination and free will that were inconsistent with the doctrine of the Reformed teachers Calvin and Beza".&lt;ref name="Rabbie"&gt;{{cite book|title= Hugo Grotius: Ordinum Hollandiae ac Westfrisiae Pietas, 1613 | first =Edwin | last = Rabbie|year=1995|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professor at Leiden==
{{See also|History of the Calvinist–Arminian debate}}
In 1603 he was called back to Leiden University to teach theology. This came about after almost simultaneous deaths in 1602 of two faculty members, [[Franciscus Junius (the elder)|Franciscus Junius]] and Lucas Trelcatius the elder, in an outbreak of [[bubonic plague|plague]]. Lucas Trelcatius the younger and Arminius (despite Plancius' protest) were appointed, the decision resting largely with [[Franciscus Gomarus]], the surviving faculty member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Keith D | last = Stanglin | title = Arminius on the Assurance of Salvation: the context, roots, and shape of the Leiden debate, 1603–1609 | year = 2007 | page = 23 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=p-2wKN4AuCQC&amp;pg=PA30 | format = Google Books| isbn = 9004156089 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Gomarus cautiously approved Arminius, whose views were already suspected of unorthodoxy, his arrival opened a period of debate rather than closed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Schaff | last2 = Herzog | publisher = CCEL | contribution-url = http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php3?authorID=schaff&amp;bookID=encyc01&amp;page=296 | contribution = Jacobus Arminius | title = [[Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge|The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment had also a political dimension, being backed by both [[Johannes Uytenbogaert]] at [[The Hague]] and [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]].{{Sfn | Israel | 1995 | p = 393}}

===Escalating controversy with Gomarus===
Gomarus, a Fleming who had been in Leiden since 1594, has been described as "a rather mediocre scholar" but "a forceful defender of the Calvinistic doctrine... a man of deep-rooted faith"&lt;ref name= "Rabbie" /&gt; In contrast Arminius has been described as "a seeker, a doubter".&lt;ref name= "Rabbie" /&gt; On the question of predestination Gomarus was a [[supralapsarian]] and it was in debate over this point that the conflict between the two began. Arminius advocated revising the ''[[Belgic Confession]]'' and the ''[[Heidelberg Catechism]]'', but was not explicit, until much later when the debate became an open conflict.&lt;ref name="Rabbie" /&gt;

The dispute took a public turn on February 7, 1604, when Willem Bastingius in his disputation ''De divina praedestinatione'' defended a number of Arminius's theses, Arminius himself presiding. This event led Gomarus to have Samuel Gruterus argue an opposite position to these theses on October 14, 1604, but not on the official schedule. Gomarus ascribed the positions he disliked to Calvin's adversary [[Sebastian Castellio]] and his follower, [[Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert]]. While Arminius pointed to the Bible to defend his positions, the Calvinist views set forth by "the Genevan patriarchs gradually acquired the force of ''[[Res judicata]]'', so that resistance against it was no longer tolerated."&lt;ref name="Rabbie" /&gt;

Opponents of Arminius outside the university gradually expanded the controversy.  The [[Classis (ecclesiastical)|classis]] in [[Dordrecht]] drew up a [[gravamen]] in which "some differences" that "were said to have arisen in the Church and University of Leiden on the doctrine of the Reformed Churches" was laid out.&lt;ref name = "Rabbie" /&gt; In response the three Leiden professors of theology (Lucas Trelcatius Jr. joining Arminius and Gomarus) and the Regent of the State College, Johannes Cuchlinus, wrote an indignant letter, stating "that as far as was known to them there was no conflict between the professors on any fundamental doctrine whatsoever."&lt;ref name="Rabbie" /&gt;

Gomarus was incited to increase his opposition to Arminius by Leiden minister [[Festus Hommius]] and Petrus Plancius, Arminius's old opponent. An anonymous series of thirty-one articles was circulated, "in which all kinds of unorthodox opinions held by Arminius were exposed".&lt;ref name= "Rabbie" /&gt; [[Sibrandus Lubbertus]], Professor of Theology at the [[University of Franeker]], began sending letters to foreign theologians attacking Arminius with charges of heresy; and one of these letters fell into Arminius's hands.  Because his opponents remained anonymous or bypassed official procedures, Arminius in April 1608 requested from the [[States of Holland]] permission to expound his views. On May 30, 1608, Arminius and Gomarus were allowed by the States to deliver speeches before the Supreme Court in The Hague. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Reinout van Brederode (Oldenbarnevelt's son-in-law) concluded that "the points of difference between the two professors, mostly relating to the subtle details of doctrine of predestination, were of minor importance and could co-exist... [and] enjoined both gentlemen to tolerate one another lovingly".&lt;ref name = "Rabbie" /&gt;

In direct defiance of the Court, Gomarus then published the speech he had made before it, and Arminius followed suit by publishing his own speech. In response to the Court's opinion Gomarus declared that "he would not dare die holding Arminius' opinion, nor to appear with it before God's judgement seat."&lt;ref name= "Rabbie" /&gt; Arminius then asked to defend his positions in public or for a national or provincial synod to be called to examine the matter. Seeking to avoid a synod, the States of Holland allowed Arminius to expound on his views to their assembly on October 30, 1608.

Before the assembly, Arminius finally explained his call to rewrite the Belgic Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism, saying that he did not feel obligated to explain his position before, for "as a professor, he considered himself subject only to the authority of the Leiden Curators and the States, not to the Church".&lt;ref name = "Rabbie" /&gt; Arminius then gave an overview of all the various opinions existing on predestination. He claimed that supralapsarianism was contrary to the Confession and Catechism and that "supra- and [[infralapsarianism]], basically amount to the same thing."&lt;ref name= "Rabbie" /&gt; Arminius put forward his own view on predestination which he held was in concordance with the Confession and the Catechism.

Learning that Arminius had appeared before the States assembly, Gomarus requested permission to address it as well, which was granted. On December 12, 1608, Gomarus blasted Arminius, accusing "his colleague of being a supporter of Pelagianism and the Jesuits; he also attacked Johannes Wtenbogaert, whom he branded a 'courtly trumpeter.'"&lt;ref name = "Rabbie" /&gt; The assembly took offence against this polemical tone, which contrasted with Arminius's [[eirenicism]], and ordered the speeches made  before them by both men to be banned from publication. Despite the ban the speeches soon appeared in print.

On July 25, 1609, Jacobus Bontebal defended the theses ''De vocatione hominis ad salutem'' under Arminius's presidency. A Roman Catholic priest (rumored to be a Jesuit) was in the audience and dared to oppose Arminius' positions. While an already seriously ill Arminius refuted the arguments, Gomarus "who was among the audience, became alternately flushing and deathly pale, and afterwards, while the Papist was within earshot, he insultingly remarked to his colleague that now the door to Papism had been widely opened."&lt;ref name="Rabbie" /&gt;

===Final debate and last days===
Arminius remained as a teacher at Leiden until his death, and was valued by his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacCulloch | first = Diarmaid | title = The Reformation: A history | publisher = Penguin Books | location = London | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-14-303538-X | page = 374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the conflict with Gomarus widened out into a large-scale split within [[Calvinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc05/Page_16.html | title = Encyclopedia | last = Schaff | volume = 5 | page = 16 | publisher = CCEL}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the local clergy, [[Adrianus Borrius]] supported Arminius, while Festus Hommius opposed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Christine | last = Kooi | title = Liberty and religion: church and state in Leiden's Reformation, 1572–1620 | year = 2000 | page = 135 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sWo9k8C8DiwC&amp;pg=PA135 | format = Google Books| isbn = 9004116435 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Close friends, students and supporters of Arminius included [[Johannes Drusius]], [[Conrad Vorstius]], [[Anthony Thysius]], [[Johannes Halsbergius]], [[Petrus Bertius]], [[Johannes Arnoldi Corvinus]], and the brothers Rembert and [[Simon Episcopius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-first = Petrus | editor-last = Bertius | title = The Works | first = James DD | last = Arminius | year = 1825 | page = 319 | url = https://books.google.co/books?id=PV0PAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA319 | format = Google Books }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; His successor at Leiden (again selected with the support of Uytenbogaert and Oldenbarnevelt) was Vorstius, a past influence on Arminius by his writings.{{Sfn | Israel | 1995 | p = 428}}

Once again the States attempted to tamp down the growing controversy without calling a synod.  Arminius was ordered to attend another conference with Gomarus in The Hague in on 13-14th August 1609. When the conference was to reconvene on the 18th August, Arminius' health began to fail and so he returned to Leiden. The States suspended the conference and asked both men for a written reaction to their adversary's viewpoint.

Arminius died on October 19, 1609 at his house at the Pieterskerkhof.  He was buried in the [[Pieterskerk, Leiden|Pieterskerk at Leiden]], where a memorial stone on his behalf was placed in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6238805 |title=Jacobus Arminius | work=[[Find A Grave]] | accessdate =June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arminius.TIF|thumb|right|Memorial stone for Jacobus Arminius at [[St. Peter's Church, Leiden]].]]
In attempting to defend Calvinistic [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] against the teachings of [[Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert]], Arminius began to doubt aspects of Calvinism and modified some parts of his own view.{{Sfn | Gonzalez | 1983 | p = 255}}  He attempted to reform Calvinism, and lent his name to a movement—[[Arminianism]]—which resisted some of the Calvinist tenets (unconditional election, the nature of the limitation of the atonement, and irresistible grace). The early Dutch followers of his teaching became known as [[Remonstrants]] after they issued a document containing five points of disagreement with mainstream Calvinism, entitled ''Remonstrantiæ'' (1610).

Arminius wrote that he sought to teach only those things which could be proved from the Scriptures and that tended toward edification among Christians (with the exception of Roman Catholics, with whom he said there could be no spiritual accord).&lt;ref&gt;''Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes. Volume I'', Phillip Schaff, Section 65, footnote 980&lt;/ref&gt;  His motto was reputed to be "''Bona conscientia paradisus''", meaning, "A good conscience is a paradise."&lt;ref&gt;''Church and School in Early Modern Protestantism: Studies in Honor of Richard A. Muller on the Maturation of a Theological Tradition'', Jordan J. Ballor, David Sytsma, Jason Zuidema
(Oct 10, 2013), page 368&lt;/ref&gt;

Arminius taught of a [[Prevenient grace|"preventing" (or prevenient) grace]] that has been conferred upon all by the Holy Spirit and this grace is "sufficient for belief, in spite of our sinful corruption, and thus for salvation."{{Sfn | Gonzalez | 1983 | p = 257}}  Arminius stated that "the grace sufficient for salvation is conferred on the Elect, and on the Non-elect; that, if they will, they may believe or not believe, may be saved or not be saved."{{Sfn | 1853 | p = 367}}  William Witt states that "Arminius has a very high theology of grace.  He insists emphatically that grace is gratuitous because it is obtained through God's redemption in Christ, not through human effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree= Ph.D. |title=Creation, Redemption and Grace in the Theology of Jacob Arminius | last=Witt |first = William Gene | year =1993 | pages = 259–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theology of Arminianism did not become fully developed during Arminius' lifetime, but after his death (1609) the ''[[Remonstrants|Five articles of the Remonstrants]]'' (1610) systematized  and formalized the ideas. But the Calvinist [[Synod of Dort]] (1618–19), convening for the purpose of condemning Arminius' theology, declared it and its adherents [[anathema]]s, defined the [[five points of Calvinism]], and persecuted Arminian pastors who remained in the Netherlands.

Publishers in Leiden (1629) and at [[Frankfurt]] (1631 and 1635) issued the works of Arminius in Latin.

[[ Image:James_Main_Dixon_1902.jpg | thumb | right | 235px | James Main Dixon, 1902 ]]
'''James Main Dixon''' [[FRSE]] (1856, [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] – 27 September 1933) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] teacher and author, and an important scholar of the [[Scots language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Charles|title=The Edinburgh history of the Scots language|year=1997|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-0754-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] in [[Scotland]] the son of Rev J. M. Dixon.&lt;ref name=BIFFRSE&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=[[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated MA from [[University of St Andrews|St. Andrews University]] in 1879 and was appointed scholar and tutor of [[philosophy]] there in the same year.

Dixon spent almost 12 years in Japan from 1880 to 1892.He was [[professor]] of [[English language|English]] and secretary of the [[Imperial College of Engineering]], [[Tokyo|Tokio]], [[Japan]], from 1879 to 1886, when he was called to the [[Tokyo University|Imperial University of Japan]] in the same capacity. There he taught [[Hidesaburo Saito]], one of the first Japanese writers of English Grammar, and [[Natsume Sōseki]], a famous novelist and ex-university professor, who disliked his style of teaching English literature. While [[Natsume Sōseki]] was in the 2nd year of his undergraduate program at [[Tokyo University]] Dixon requested him to translate [[Hōjōki]]. Later on based on Sōseki's  translation Dixon produced a new English translation of this work and also authored an article comparing Kamo no Chomei, the author of [[Hōjōki]] and [[William Wordsworth]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20170911115351/http://www.bunka.soken.ac.jp/journal_bunka/13_04_gouranga/gouranga.pdf ] Among his other contributions in Japan, he is credited with the rediscovery (together with his friend, [[Alexander Croft Shaw]]), of former [[Nakasendō]] [[69 Stations of the Nakasendō|post town]] of [[Karuizawa]], and its popularization as a summer resort.

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1885. His proposers were [[Robert Flint]], [[John Duns]], William Swan, and his brother-in-law [[Cargill Gilston Knott]].&lt;ref name=BIFFRSE/&gt;

From 1892 to 1901 he was professor of [[English literature]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri|Mo.]]  

In 1902, when [[Robert Burns]]' birthplace was reconstructed at the [[St. Louis World's Fair]], Dixon was made Chairman of the Library and Museum Committee of the Burns Cottage Association. He explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was brought up at [[Ayr]], the Burns neighborhood, and came from an Ayrshire family. My granduncle, John Gray, was town clerk of Ayr and secretary of the great Burns Festival of 1844, when 80,000 good people gathered in a field beside the cottage to honor the name of Ayr's most noted son.

 My youth was passed in the place where the 'twa brigs,' the [[river Doon]], [[Alloway Kirk]], [[Tam O'Shanter Inn]], the '[[Brig o' Doon]]' and the [[Burns Cottage|Burns cottage]] and monument are all within a radius of three miles, and you must know that anything pertaining to Burns is indelibly impressed upon me.&lt;ref&gt;"Burns' Birtplace Will be Rebuilt on the World's Fair Site," ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', 15 June 1902, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1903–1904 he was president of [[Milton-Freewater City Hall|Columbia College]], in [[Milton-Freewater, Oregon|Milton]], [[Oregon]].  He was professor of English literature at the [[University of Southern California]] from 1905 to 1911, when he was transferred to the [[chair (official)|chair]] of [[The Orient|Orient]]al studies and [[comparative literature]].  In 1906 he became editor of the ''[[West Coast Magazine]]''.

In 1908, he received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from [[Dickinson College]].

He died on 27 September 1933.

==Writings==

He compiled a ''Dictionary of [[Idiom]]atic English [[Phrase]]s'' (1891) and wrote:  ''Twentieth Century Life of [[John Wesley]]'' (1902);  "[[Matthew Arnold]]," in ''Modern Poets and Christian Teaching'' (1906); and ''A Survey of Scottish Literature in the Nineteenth Century'' (1907).  In 1920, he wrote, ''The Spiritual Meaning of [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s "In Memoriam"'' and ''Manual of Modern Scots''.

==Family==

His sister, Mary Dixon, married [[Cargill Gilston Knott]] in 1885.&lt;ref name=BIFFRSE/&gt;

:''See also [[Zen]] for an overview of Zen, [[Chan Buddhism]] for the Chinese origins, and [[Sōtō]], [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] and [[Ōbaku]] for the three main schools of Zen in Japan''

'''Zen''' is the Japanese variant of [[Chan Buddhism]], a [[Mahayana]] school that strongly emphasizes [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]] [[Samatha|concentration-meditation]]. This practice, according to Zen proponents, gives insight into one's [[Buddha-nature|true nature]], or the [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] of inherent existence, which opens the way to a [[enlightenment in Buddhism|liberated way of living]].

==History==
{{See also|History of Japan}}

===Chinese origins===
{{Main article|History of Buddhism in India|Chinese Buddhism|Chan Buddhism|Bodhidharma}}

[[File:Mahakasyapa.jpg|right|100px]]

According to tradition, Zen originated in [[India]], when [[Gautama Buddha]] held up a flower and [[Mahākāśyapa]] smiled. With this smile he showed that he had understood the wordless essence of the [[dharma#Buddhism|dharma]]. This way the dharma was transmitted to Mahākāśyapa, the second patriarch of Zen.&lt;ref name="Denkoroku"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Cook|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word 禪 (Chan) which traces its roots to the Indian practice of dhyāna ("meditation"). Buddhism was introduced to [[China]] in the first century CE. According to tradition, Chan was introduced around 500 CE by [[Bodhidharma]], an Indian monk teaching [[dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]. He was the 28th Indian patriarch of Zen and the first Chinese patriarch.&lt;ref name="Denkoroku" /&gt;

===Kamakura (1185–1333)===
{{Main article|Buddhism in Japan}}

Buddhism was introduced in Japan in the 8th century CE during the [[Nara period]] (710-794) and the [[Heian period]] (794–1185). Zen was not introduced as a separate school in Japan until the 12th century during the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333), when [[Nōnin]] established the Daruma-school. In 1189 Nōnin{{sfn|Breugem|2006|p=39-60}} sent two students to China, to meet with Cho-an Te-kuang (1121–1203), and ask for the recognition of Nōnin as a Zen-master. This recognition was granted.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-B|p=7-8}}

In 1168, [[Eisai]] traveled to China, whereafter he studied Tendai for twenty years.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-B|p=14–15}} In 1187 he went to China again, and returned to establish a local branch of the [[Linji school]], which is known in Japan as the [[Rinzai school]].&lt;ref name="Snelling"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Snelling|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, {{Nihongo|[[Nampo Jōmyō]]|南浦紹明}} (1235–1308) also studied Linji teachings in China before founding the Japanese [[Ōtōkan]] lineage, the most influential branch of Rinzai.

In 1215, [[Dōgen]], a younger contemporary of Eisai's, journeyed to China himself, where he became a disciple of the [[Caodong school|Caodong]] master [[Rujing]]. After his return, [[Dōgen]] established the [[Sōtō]] school, the Japanese branch of Caodong.&lt;ref name="Snelling"/&gt;

Zen fit the way of life of the [[samurai]]: confronting death without fear, and acting in a spontaneous and intuitive way.&lt;ref name="Snelling" /&gt;

During this period the [[Five Mountain System]] was established, which institutionalized an influential part of the Rinzai school. It consisted of the five most famous Zen temples of Kyoto: [[Kenchō-ji]], [[Engaku-ji]], [[Jufuku-ji]], [[Jōmyō-ji]] and [[Jōchi-ji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005-B|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muromachi (or Ashikaga) (1336–1573)===
[[File:Ginkaku-ji, Kyoto.jpg|Kogetsudai, Ginkaku-ji, [[Kyoto]]|thumb|left|Kogetsudai, [[Ginkaku-ji]] temple, [[Kyoto]]]]
During the [[Muromachi period]] the Rinzai school was the most successful of the schools, since it was favoured by the ''[[shōgun]]''.

====Gozan-system====
In the beginning of the Muromachi period the Gozan system was fully worked out. The final version contained five temples of both Kyoto and Kamakura. A second tier of the system consisted of Ten Temples. This system was extended throughout Japan, effectively giving control to the central government, which administered this system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005-B|pp=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monks, often well educated and skilled, were employed by the ''shōgun'' for the governing of state affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005-B|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rinka-monasteries====
Not all Rinzai Zen organisations were under such strict state control. The Rinka monasteries, which were primarily located in rural areas rather than cities, had a greater degree of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005-B|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The O-to-kan lineage, that centered on [[Daitoku-ji]], also had a greater degree of freedom. It was founded by Nampo Jomyo, Shuho Myocho, and Kanzan Egen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005-B|pp=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known teacher from Daitoku-ji was [[Ikkyū]].&lt;ref name="Snelling"/&gt;

Another Rinka lineage was the Hotto lineage, of which [[Bassui Tokushō]] is the best-known teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005-B|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soto====
Soto too spread out over Japan. Gasan adopted the [[Five Ranks]] of [[Dongshan Liangjie|Tung-shan]] as a fit vehicle to explain the Mahayana teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005-B|pp=208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hakuin.jpg|thumb|left|Hakuin]]

After a [[Sengoku period|period of war]] Japan was re-united in the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]]. This decreased the power of Buddhism, which had become a strong political and military force in Japan. Neo-Confucianism gained influence at the expense of Buddhism, which came under strict state control. Japan closed the gates to the rest of the world. The only traders to be allowed were Dutchmen admitted to the island of [[Dejima]].&lt;ref name="Snelling"/&gt; New doctrines and methods were not to be introduced, nor were new temples and schools. The only exception was the [[Ōbaku]] lineage, which was introduced in the 17th century during the [[Edo period]] by [[Ingen]], a Chinese monk. Ingen had been a member of the Linji school, the Chinese equivalent of Rinzai, which had developed separately from the Japanese branch for hundreds of years. Thus, when Ingen journeyed to Japan following the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Manchu people]], his teachings were seen as a separate school. The Ōbaku school was named after {{nihongo|[[Mount Huangbo]]|黄檗山|Ōbaku-sān}}, which had been Ingen's home in China.

Well-known Zen masters from this period are Bankei, Bashō and Hakuin.&lt;ref name="Snelling"/&gt; [[Bankei Yōtaku]] (盤珪永琢?, 1622–1693) became a classic example of a man driven by the "great doubt". [[Matsuo Bashō]] (松尾 芭蕉?, 1644 – November 28, 1694) became a great Zen poet. In the 18th century [[Hakuin Ekaku]] (白隠 慧鶴?, 1686–1768) revived the Rinzai school. His influence was so immense that almost all contemporary Rinzai lineages are traced back to him.

===Meiji Restoration (1868–1912) and Imperial expansionism (1912–1945)===
The [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912) saw the restoration of the political importance of the Emperor after a coup in 1868. At that time Japan opened up to Western influences, restructuring all government and commercial structures to Western standards.  [[Shinto]] became the state religion and Buddhism was coerced to adapt to the new regime. The Buddhist establishment saw the Western world as a threat, but also as a challenge to stand up to.&lt;ref name="McMahan 2008"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McMahan|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Victoria, Brian Daizen 2006"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Victoria|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shinto]] became the official religion, at the expense of Buddhism. Buddhist institutions had a simple choice: adapt or perish. Rinzai and Soto Zen chose to adapt, trying to modernize Zen in accord with Western insights, while simultaneously maintaining a Japanese identity. This Japanese identity was being articulated in the [[Nihonjinron]] philosophy, the "Japanese uniqueness" theory. A broad range of subjects was taken as typical of Japanese culture. D.T. Suzuki contributed to the Nihonjinron-philosophy by taking Zen as the distinctive token of Asian spirituality, showing its unique character in the Japanese culture&lt;ref name="Harvcolnb|Sharf|1993"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Sharf|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This resulted in support for the war activities of the Japanese imperial system by the Japanese Zen establishment—including the Sōtō sect, the major branches of Rinzai, and several renowned teachers. According to Sharf,
{{quote|They became willing accomplices in the promulgation of the [[kokutai]] (national polity) ideology—the attempt to render Japan a culturally homogeneous and spiritually evolved nation politically unified under the divine rule of the emperor.&lt;ref name="Harvcolnb|Sharf|1993"/&gt;}}
War endeavours against Russia, China and finally during the [[Pacific War]] were supported by the Zen establishment.&lt;ref name="Victoria, Brian Daizen 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Victoria, Brian Daizen 2010"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Victoria|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable work on this subject was ''[[Zen at War]]'' (1998) by Brian Victoria,&lt;ref name="Victoria, Brian Daizen 2006"/&gt; an American-born Sōtō priest. One of his assertions was that some Zen masters known for their post-war internationalism and promotion of "world [[peace]]" were open [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese nationalists]] in the inter-war years.&lt;ref group=web name="newyorktimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jalon|first1=Allan M.|title=Meditating On War And Guilt, Zen Says It's Sorry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/11/books/meditating-on-war-and-guilt-zen-says-it-s-sorry.html|work=The New York Times|date=11 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them as an example [[Hakuun Yasutani]], the founder of the [[Sanbo Kyodan]] School, even voiced [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] and nationalistic opinions after [[World War II]]. Only after international protests in the 1990s, following the publication of Victoria's 'Zen at war', did the Sanbo Kyodan express apologies for this support&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080704201754/http://www.mkzc.org/apology.html Apology for What the Founder of the Sanbo-Kyodan, Haku'un Yasutani Roshi, Said and Did During World War II]&lt;/ref&gt; This involvement was not limited to the Zen schools, as all orthodox Japanese schools of Buddhism supported the [[militarist]] state. Victoria's particular claims about [[D. T. Suzuki]]'s involvement in militarism have been much disputed by other scholars.

===Present time (after 1945)===
Interest in Zen grew in the West after World War II. Westerners such as Philip Kapleau and the Dutchman [[Janwillem van de Wetering]] went to Japan to study Zen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Wetering|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese teachers came to the West to share Zen practice and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Suzuki|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary Japanese Zen teachers, such as [[Harada Daiun Sogaku]] and [[Shunryū Suzuki]], have criticized Japanese Zen as being a formalized system of empty [[ritual]]s in which very few Zen practitioners ever actually attained realization. They assert that almost all Japanese temples have become family businesses handed down from father to son, and the Zen priest's function has largely been reduced to officiating at [[funeral]]s, a practice sarcastically referred to in Japan as {{Nihongo||葬式仏教|sōshiki bukkyō|funeral Buddhism}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} For example, the Sōtō school published statistics stating that 80 percent of laity visited temples only for reasons having to do with funerals and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Bodiford|1992|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
{{See also|Zen#Zen teachings}}

===Buddha-nature and Sunyata===
{{See also|Buddhist philosophy}}

[[File:Satori.svg|thumb|right|100px|The Japanese term 悟り satori, made up of the Chinese character 悟 (pronounced wù in Mandarin and meaning "understand") and the hiragana syllable り ri.]]

Mahayana Buddhism teaches [[śūnyatā]], "emptiness", which is also emphasized by Zen. But another important doctrine is the [[buddha-nature]], the idea that all human beings have the possibility to awaken. All living creatures are supposed to have the Buddha-nature, but don't realize this as long as they are not [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakened]]. The doctrine of an essential nature can easily lead to the idea that there is an unchanging essential nature or reality behind the changing world of appearances.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana 1992"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kalupahana|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference and reconciliation of these two doctrines is the central theme of the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana 1992" /&gt;

===Kensho: seeing one's true nature===
{{main article|Enlightenment in Buddhism}}

The primary goal of Rinzai Zen is ''kensho'', seeing one's true nature, and ''mujodo no taigen'', expression of this insight in daily life.&lt;ref name="Kapleau"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kapleau|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Seeing one's true nature'' means seeing that there is no essential 'I' or 'self', that our true nature is [[Sunyata|empty]].

''Expression in daily life'' means that this is not only a contemplative insight, but that our lives are expressions of this selfless existence.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.beingwithoutself.org/talks/SummitLectures.pdf Jeff Shore: The constant practice of right effort]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Zen meditation is the essential method of Zen. In Rinzai Zen this is supplemented by kōan training.

===Zen meditation===
{{main article|Zazen}}

[[File:Zazen au Centre Européen du Zen Rinzai.jpg|left|150px]]

Zen emphasizes [[zazen]]: [[meditation]] as the means to awakening. There are various methods of meditation. In Buddhism two main approaches are used, [[vipassanā|vipaśyanā]] (insight training) and [[samatha| śamatha]] (concentration of the mind). Zen Buddhism emphasizes ''samātha''. The Japanese word ''Zen'' is derived from the Chinese word '''禅''', {{zh|p=chán}}, which is derived from the Sanskrit [[dhyāna in Buddhism|''dhyāna'']] "meditation". The Japanese word ''zazen'' means "sitting meditation". However, Zen meditation ideally is not only concentration, but also awareness: being aware of the continuing changes in our consciousness, of all our sensations and our automatic reactions.

In alternation with zazen, there is [[walking meditation]], ''kinhin'', in which one walks with full attention.

===Kōans===
{{main article|Kōan}}
To facilitate insight, a Zen teacher can assign a [[kōan]]. This is a short anecdote, which seems irrational, but contains subtle references to the Buddhist teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Sharfa|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a kōan is Joshu's 'Mu':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mumonkan|title=The Gateless Gate|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/zen/mumonkan.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''A monk asked: "Does a dog have buddha-nature?" Joshu responded: "[[Mu (negative)|Mu]]!"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Contemporary Zen organizations==
The traditional schools of Zen in contemporary [[Japan]] are the [[Sōtō]] ({{lang|ja|曹洞}}), [[Rinzai]] ({{lang|ja|臨済}}), and [[Ōbaku]] ({{lang|ja|黃檗}}). Of these, Sōtō is the largest and Ōbaku the smallest. Besides these there are modern Zen organizations which have especially attracted Western lay followers, namely the [[Sanbo Kyodan]] and the FAS Society.

===Sōtō===
[[Sōtō]] emphasizes meditation and the inseparable nature of practice and insight. Its founder [[Dogen]] is still highly revered.

===Rinzai===
[[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] emphasizes kōan study and [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|kensho]]. The Rinzai organisation includes fifteen subschools based on temple affiliation. The best known of these main temples are [[Myoshin-ji]], [[Nanzen-ji]], [[Tenryū-ji]], [[Daitoku-ji]], and [[Tofuku-ji]].

===Obaku===
[[Ōbaku]] is a small branch, which organizationally, is part of the Rinzai school.

===Sanbo Kyodan===
[[File:Haku'un Yasutani and Phillip Kapleau.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Haku'un Yasutani and Phillip Kapleau]]

The [[Sanbo Kyodan]] is a small Japanese school, established by [[Hakuun Yasutani]], which has been very influential in the West. Well-known teachers from this school are [[Philip Kapleau]] and [[Taizan Maezumi]]. Maezumi's influence stretches further through his dharma heirs, such as [[Joko Beck]], [[Tetsugen Bernard Glassman]], and especially [[Dennis Merzel]], who has appointed more than a dozen dharma heirs.

===FAS Society===
The FAS Society is a non-sectarian organization, founded by [[Shin'ichi Hisamatsu]]. Its aim is to modernize Zen and adapt it to the modern world. In Europe it is influential through such teachers as [[Jeff Shore]] and [[Ton Lathouwers]].

==Zen in the Western world==
{{See also|Buddhism in the West}}

===Early influences===
Although it is difficult to trace when the West first became aware of Zen as a distinct form of Buddhism, the visit of [[Soyen Shaku]], a Japanese Zen monk, to [[Chicago]] during the [[World Parliament of Religions]] in 1893 is often pointed to as an event that enhanced its profile in the Western world. It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners pursuing a serious interest in Zen, other than descendants of Asian immigrants, reached a significant level.

[[Eugen Herrigel]]'s book ''[[Zen in the Art of Archery]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Herrigel|1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing his training in the Zen-influenced [[martial art]] of [[Kyūdō]], inspired many of the Western world's early Zen practitioners. However, many scholars, such as Yamada Shoji, are quick to criticize this book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Shoji|Year unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===D.T. Suzuki===
The single most influential person for the spread of Zen Buddhism was [[D. T. Suzuki]].&lt;ref name="McMahan 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvcolnb|Sharf|1993"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Sharf|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lay student of Zen, he became acquainted with Western culture at a young age. He wrote many books on Zen which became widely read in the Western world, but he has been criticised for giving a one-sided and overly romanticized vision of Zen.&lt;ref name="McMahan 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvcolnb|Sharf|1993"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hu Shih|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reginald Horace Blyth]] (1898–1964) was an Englishman who went to Japan in 1940 to further his study of Zen. He was interned during World War II and started writing in prison. While imprisoned he met Robert Aitken, who was later to become a roshi in the Sanbo Kyodan lineage. Blyth was tutor to the Crown Prince after the war. His greatest work is the 5-volume "Zen and Zen Classics", published in the 1960s. Here he discusses Zen themes from a philosophical standpoint, often in conjunction with Christian elements in a comparative spirit. His essays include "God, Buddha, and Buddhahood" and "Zen, Sin, and Death".

===Beat Zen===
The British [[philosopher]] [[Alan Watts]] took a close interest in Zen Buddhism and wrote and lectured extensively on it during the 1950s. He understood Zen as a vehicle for a mystical transformation of consciousness, and also as a historical example of a non-Western, non-[[Christianity|Christian]] way of life that had fostered both the practical and [[fine arts]].

''[[The Dharma Bums]]'', a [[novel]] written by [[Jack Kerouac]] and published in 1959, gave its readers a look at how a fascination with Buddhism and Zen was being absorbed into the bohemian lifestyles of a small group of [[United States|American]] youths, primarily on the West Coast. Beside the narrator, the main character in this novel was "Japhy Ryder", a thinly veiled depiction of [[Gary Snyder]]. The story was based on actual events taking place while Snyder prepared, in California, for the formal Zen studies that he would pursue in Japanese monasteries between 1956 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Heller|Year unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian Zen===
[[Thomas Merton]] (1915–1968) was a [[Catholic]] [[Trappist]] monk and priest.&lt;ref group=web name="mertonchronology"&gt;[http://www.merton.org/chrono.htm A Chronology of Thomas Merton's Life]. The Thomas Merton Center at Bellarmine University. Retrieved 26 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his friend, the late [[D.T. Suzuki]], Merton believed that there must be a little of Zen in all authentic creative and spiritual experience. The dialogue between Merton and Suzuki&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Merton|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; explores the many congruencies of Christian mysticism and Zen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Merton|1967-A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Mertont|1967-B}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2012}}

[[File:Makibi Enomiya-Lasalle (1898-1990).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Father Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle]]

[[Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle]] (1898–1990) was a Jesuit who became a missionary in Japan in 1929. In 1956 he started to study Zen with Harada Daiun Sogaku. He was the superior of [[Heinrich Dumoulin]], the well-known author on the history of Zen. Enomiya-lassalle introduced Westerners to Zen meditation.

[[Robert Kennedy (roshi)]], a [[Catholic]] [[Jesuit]] priest, professor, [[psychotherapist]] and Zen [[Rōshi|roshi]] in the White Plum lineage has written a number of books about what he labels as the benefits of Zen practice to Christianity. He was ordained a Catholic priest in Japan in 1965, and studied with [[Yamada Koun]] in [[Japan]] in the 1970s. He was installed as a Zen teacher of the [[White Plum Asanga]] lineage in 1991 and was given the title 'Roshi' in 1997.

In 1989, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] released a document which states some Catholic appreciation of the use of Zen in Christian prayer. According to the text none of the methods proposed by non-Christian religions should be rejected out of hand simply because they are not Christian: {{quote|On the contrary, one can take from them what is useful so long as the Christian concept of prayer, its logic and requirements are never obscured.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfmed.htm Vatican discernments around the use of Zen and Yoga in christian prayer]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Zen and the art of...===
While ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'', by [[Robert M. Pirsig]], was a 1974 [[bestseller]], it in fact has little to do with Zen as a religious practice, nor with motorcycle maintenance for that matter. Rather it deals with the notion of the [[Pirsig's metaphysics of quality|metaphysics of "quality"]] from the point of view of the main character. Pirsig was attending the [[Minnesota Zen Center]] at the time of writing the book. He has stated that, despite its title, the book "should in no way be associated with that great body of factual information relating to orthodox Zen Buddhist practice". Though it may not deal with orthodox Zen Buddhist practice, Pirsig's book in fact deals with many of the more subtle facets of Zen living and Zen mentality without drawing attention to any religion or religious organization.

A number of contemporary authors have explored the relationship between Zen and a number of other disciplines, including parenting, teaching, and leadership. This typically involves the use of Zen stories to explain leadership strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Warneka|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
In Europe, the [[Expressionist]] and [[Dada]] movements in art tend to have much in common thematically with the study of kōans and actual Zen. The early French [[surrealist]] [[René Daumal]] translated [[D.T. Suzuki]] as well as [[Sanskrit]] Buddhist texts.

==Western Zen lineages derived from Japan==
Over the last fifty years mainstream forms of Zen, led by teachers who trained in East Asia and their successors, have begun to take root in the West.

===USA===

====Sanbo Kyodan====
In North America, the Zen lineages derived from the [[Sanbo Kyodan]] school are the most numerous. The [[Sanbo Kyodan]] is a Japan-based reformist Zen group, founded in 1954 by [[Yasutani hakuun|Yasutani Hakuun]], which has had a significant influence on Zen in the West. Sanbo Kyodan Zen is based primarily on the Soto tradition, but also incorporates Rinzai-style kōan practice. Yasutani's approach to Zen first became prominent in the English-speaking world through [[Philip Kapleau]]'s book ''The Three Pillars of Zen'' (1965), which was one of the first books to introduce Western audiences to Zen as a practice rather than simply a philosophy. Among the Zen groups in North America, Hawaii, Europe, and New Zealand which derive from [[Sanbo Kyodan]] are those associated with Kapleau, [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], and [[John Tarrant (Zen Buddhist)|John Tarrant]].

The most widespread are the lineages founded by [[Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi]] and the [[White Plum Asanga]]. Maezumi's successors include [[Susan Myoyu Andersen]], [[John Daido Loori]], [[Chozen Bays]], [[Tetsugen Bernard Glassman]], [[Heart Circle Sangha|Nicolee Jikyo McMahon]], [[Heart Circle Sangha|Joan Hogetsu Hoeberichts]], and [[Charlotte Joko Beck]].

====Soto====
Soto has gained prominence via [[Shunryu Suzuki]], who established the [[San Francisco Zen Center]]. In 1967 the Center established Tassajara, the first Zen Monastery in America, in the mountains near [[Big Sur]].

The Katagiri lineage, founded by [[Dainin Katagiri]], has a significant presence in the Midwest. Note that both Taizan Maezumi and Dainin Katagiri served as priests at [[Zenshuji Soto Mission]] in the 1960s.

[[Taisen Deshimaru]], a student of Kodo Sawaki, was a Soto Zen priest from [[Japan]] who taught in [[France]]. The [[International Zen Association]], which he founded, remains influential. The [[American Zen Association]], headquartered at the [[New Orleans Zen Temple]], is one of the North American organizations practicing in the Deshimaru tradition.

[[Soyu Matsuoka]] established the Long Beach Zen Buddhist Temple and Zen Center in 1971, where he resided until his death in 1998. The Temple was headquarters to Zen centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Everett, Washington.
Matsuoka created several dharma heirs, three of whom are still alive and leading Zen teachers within the lineage: Hogaku ShoZen McGuire, Zenkai Taiun Michael Elliston Sensei, and Kaiten John Dennis Govert.

[[Brad Warner]] is a Soto priest appointed by [[Gudo Wafu Nishijima]]. He is not a traditional Zen teacher, but is influential via his blogs on Zen.

====Rinzai====
Rinzai gained prominence in the West via [[D.T. Suzuki]] and the lineage of [[Soen Nakagawa]] and his student [[Eido Shimano]]. Soen Nakagawa had personal ties to [[Yamada Koun]], the dharma heir of [[Hakuun Yasutani]], who founded the [[Sanbo Kyodan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Tanahashi|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; They established [[Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji]] in New York. In Europe there is [[Havredal Zendo]] established by a [[Dharma heir|Dharma Heir]] of Eido Shimano, Egmund Sommer (Denko Mortensen).

Some of the more prominent Rinzai Zen centers in North America include [[Rinzai-ji]] founded by [[Kyozan Joshu Sasaki]] Roshi in California, [[Chozen-ji]] founded by [[Omori Sogen Roshi]] in Hawaii, [[Daiyuzenji]] founded by Dogen Hosokawa Roshi (a student of Omori Sogen Roshi) in Chicago, Illinois, and [[Chobo-Ji]] founded by [[Dai Bai Zan Cho Bo Zen Ji|Genki Takabayshi]] Roshi in Seattle, Washington.

===United Kingdom===
The lineage of [[Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi]] Roshi is represented in the UK by the [[White Plum Sangha UK]].

[[Throssel Hole Buddhist Abbey]] was founded as a sister monastery to [[Shasta Abbey]] in California by Master Reverend Jiyu Kennett Roshi. It has a number of dispersed priories and centres.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Jiyu Kennett, an Englishwoman, was ordained as a priest and Zen master in Shoji-ji, one of the two main Soto Zen temples in Japan.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Her book ''The Wild White Goose'' describes her experiences in Japan}} The Order is called the [[Order of Buddhist Contemplatives]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[Taisen Deshimaru]] Roshi's lineage is known in the UK as [[IZAUK]] (International Zen Association UK).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The [[Zen Centre]] in London is connected to the [[Buddhist Society]].

The [[Western Chan Fellowship]] is an association of lay Chán practitioners based in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} They are registered as a charity in England and Wales, but also have contacts in Europe, principally in Norway, Poland, Germany, Croatia, Switzerland and the US.

'''Jesa''' (제사, 祭祀) is a ceremony commonly practiced in [[Korea]]. Jesa functions as a [[Ancestor veneration|memorial]] to the ancestors of the participants. Jesa are usually held on the anniversary of the ancestor's death. The majority of Catholics, [[Buddhist]]s and nonbelievers practice ancestral rites, although Protestants do not.&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=Chang-Won|title=Cultural Blending in Korean Death Rites|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|date=10 June 2010|pages=12–13|isbn=978-1-4411-1749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic ban on ancestral rituals was lifted in 1939, when the [[Pope Pius XII]] of the [[Catholic Church]] formally recognized ancestral rites as a civil practice (see [[Chinese Rites controversy]]).&lt;ref name="park"/&gt;  Many [[Korean American]] Christians, particularly [[Protestant]]s, no longer practice this rite.&lt;ref name="suh"&gt;{{citation|title=Being Buddhist in a Christian World: Gender and Community in a Korean American Temple|last=Suh|first=Sharon A.|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=0-295-98378-7|pages=49|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kwon|first=Okyun|title=Buddhist and protestant Korean immigrants: religious beliefs and socioeconomic aspects of life|publisher=LFB Scholarly Publishing LLC|year=2003|pages=137–138|isbn=978-1-931202-65-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kinds of ancestor rituals ==
There are several kinds of ancestor rituals such as gijesa (기제사, 忌祭祀), charye (차례, 茶禮), seongmyo (성묘, 省墓), myosa (묘사, 墓祀). Gijesa is a memorial service which is held on the day of the ancestor's death every year. Gijesa is performed until upwards of five generations of ancestors in the eldest descendant's house. Memorial services that are performed on Chuseok or New Year's Day are called "charye," On April 5 and before Chuseok, Koreans visit the tombs of their ancestors and trim the grass off the tombs. Then, they offer food, fruits, and wine, and finally make bows in front of the tombs. Memorial services that are performed in front of tombs are called "seongmyo" Finally Myosa are performed at the tomb site in the lunar month of October to conduct in memory of old ancestors (five or more generations)..

Ancestral rites are typically divided into 3 categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bae|first=Choon Sup|date=August 2007|title=The Challenge of Ancestor Worship in Korea|publisher=University of Pretoria|url=http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05272008-141650/unrestricted/03chapter4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Charye (차례, 茶禮) - [[Korean tea|tea rites]] held 4 times a year on major holidays ([[Korean New Year]], [[Chuseok]])
#Gije (기제, 忌祭, also called ''gijesa'') - household rites held the night before or morning of an ancestor's death anniversary (기일, 忌日). 
#Sije (시제, 時祭; also called 사시제 or 四時祭) - seasonal rites held for ancestors who are 5 or more generations removed (typically performed annually on the tenth lunar month)

==Performance==
[[File:Korean ancestor veneration-Jesa-02.jpg|thumb|''Jesasang(Jesa table)'']]
To perform ancestor rituals, the family at the eldest son's house prepare many kinds of food such as [[wine]], [[taro soup]], [[beef]], [[fish]], three different colored [[vegetables]], many kinds of [[fruit]]s, and [[rice cake]] or [[songpyon]], particularly those that were favored by the deceased.&lt;ref name="suh"/&gt; The ''[[Spirit tablet|shinwi]]'' (신위, 神位) or memorial tablet, which symbolizes the spiritual presence of the ancestor, is placed at the center of the table.&lt;ref name="howto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2010/09/how-to-hold-jesa.html|title=How to Hold Jesa|date=19 September 2010|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern days, the daughter or younger son of the family may perform these rites.

After midnight or in the evening before an ancestor's death anniversary, the descendants set the shrine, with a paper screen facing north and food laid out on a lacquer table as follows: rice, meat, and white fruits on the west, soup, fish, and red fruits on the east, with fruits on the first row, meat and fish on the second, vegetables on the third, and cooked rice and soup on the last.&lt;ref name="courtney"&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtney|first=Charles|author2=Jung Young Lee|title=East wind: Taoist and cosmological implications of Christian theology|publisher=University Press of America|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7618-0861-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The prescribed method in [[Hanja]] is as follows: 飯西羹東， 紅東白西， 魚東肉西，頭東尾西。 (반서갱동， 홍동백서， 어동육서，두동미서). [http://www.kscn.co.kr/05/1.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; The rice bowls and individual offerings to the male ancestors are placed to the west, and those of females to the east (고서비동, 考西妣東). Two candles are also laid on both ends of the table, and an incense holder is placed in the middle. In front of the shrine, they set up written prayer, if the family does not own a memorial tablet (신위).

A typical rite is generally performed following this sequence:&lt;ref name="courtney"/&gt;
#''Kangshin'' (강신, {{linktext|降神}}) - Several ritual greetings call the spirits down then follow.
#''Choheon'' (초헌, {{linktext|初|獻}}, "initial offering") - The eldest male descendant makes the first offering of [[rice wine]], followed by his wife. At the conclusion of the first ritual offering, the eldest son would show his respects by performing a ritual bow twice. The wife bows four times.
#''Aheon'' (아헌, {{linktext|亞|獻}}, "secondary offering") - The second eldest male descendant (typically the next eldest sons or sons-in law) makes an offering of liquor as well.
#''Jongheon'' (종헌, {{linktext|終|獻}}, "final offering") - The third eldest male descendant (typically the next eldest sons or sons-in law) makes an offering of liquor as well. Offerings are continued to be made until no high-ranking male descendants are left.
#''Sapsi'' (삽시, {{linktext|揷|匙}}, "spoon insertion") - The main course is served by the eldest male descendant, to the memorial tablet, by sticking a spoon into the middle of the rice bowl.
#''Yushik'' (유식, {{linktext|侑|食}}, "urged meal") - The ancestors receive the offerings and partake in the meal. To do so, participants leave the room, called ''hapmun'' (합문, 闔門). Afterward, in ''gyemun'' (계문, 啟門) - participants return to the room, after a few minutes. This is signaled by the eldest male descendant clearing his throat twice.
#''Heonda'' (헌다, {{linktext|献|茶}}, "tea offering") - Tea, brewed from roasted rice is offered to the ancestors.
#''Cheolsang'' (철상, {{linktext|撤|床}}, "removal of table") - All the attendants at the ceremony bow twice and the spirits are sent off until the next year. The table with the food and wine offerings is then cleared and the written prayer recited earlier on during the ceremony is set a fire.
#''Eumbok'' (음복, {{linktext|飮|福}}, "drink blessings") - Participants divide the sacrificial offerings and partake in the feast. Consuming the ritual food and wine is considered to be an integral part of the ceremony, as it symbolizes the receiving of the blessings bestowed upon the family.

The altar food may be distributed to neighbors and friends in a [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist rite]] called ''shishik'', which is a form of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit-making]] that, along with [[sutra]] reading and intoning of Buddha's teachings, expedities the deceased spirit's entry into [[Sukhavati]].&lt;ref name="suh"/&gt;

== Modern ancestor rituals ==
Ancestor worship has significantly changed in recent years. These days it is common to hold ancestor rituals up to only two generations of ancestors, and in some cases, people only hold rituals for their dead parents. In addition, more people are holding rituals in the evening, not after midnight. People can also perform ancestor rituals in a younger son's house.

Today, in most Korean families, ancestor rituals still remain an important part of their culture and they are faithfully observed. These ancestor rituals, in spite of revised form, continue to play an important part in modern Korean society, which testifies to their inherent importance in the lives of Koreans.

== Heotjesatbap ==
In [[Andong]] during the [[Joseon Dynasty]], it was common for jesa foods to be eaten rather than used in the ceremony. Such meals were called ''[[heotjesatbap]]'' or "fake jesa food." The most common dish was a special type of [[bibimbap]] mixed with [[soy sauce]] (ganjang) instead of the more commonly used hot pepper paste [[gochujang]]. They were a common late-night snack for [[yangban]] scholars known as [[seonbi's]], and many restaurants in Andong still serve heotjesatbap today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hansik.org/en/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?fboardId=1061 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402111549/http://www.hansik.org/en/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?fboardId=1061 |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth''' (JDV) is a [[Pontifical]] institute for philosophy and  religion located at [[Pune]], [[India]]. Established in 1893, it caters primarily to the formation of future [[Catholic priest]]s in India&lt;ref&gt;''Directory'', New Delhi: Jesuit Conference of South Asia, 2010, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
JDV is the degree granting ''athenaeum'' of the Papal Seminary which was founded in 1893 at [[Kandy]], [[Sri Lanka]], which was considered a part of [[British India|occupied India]], to look after the formation of Catholic priests for the whole of India. After [[Partition of India|Indian Independence]], it became difficult for Indians to go to Sri Lanka for studies. In 1955, Papal Seminary along with its Athenaeum moved to Pune. The Athenaeum of the Papal Seminary adopted the Indian name Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth in 1972 (see the Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth Handbook and Calendar 2015-2016 pp.&amp;nbsp;8–10). In 2015 it celebrated its diamond jubilee of transfer to Pune. It continues to offer philosophy and theology courses for those studying for the Catholic priesthood. It also serves as an intellectual centre for the Catholic Church in India, having taken a leading role in promoting inculturation since the 1970s. Its "Department of Indian Studies" brings "Indian" insights to the Christian faith.

==Programs==
In the 1970s and 1980s  JDV was the driving force for [[inculturation]], [[inter-religious dialog]], and "[[liberation theology]]" for the Indian church. Personalities like [[Richard De Smet]],&lt;ref&gt;De Smet, Richard, and Bradley J. Malkovsky. ''New Perspectives on Advaita VedaAnta: Essays in Commemoration of Professor Richard De Smet.'' Numen Book Series, Studies in the History of Religions. [[Leiden]]; [[Boston]]: [[Brill Publishers]], 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; George Lobo,&lt;ref&gt;Lobo, George V. ''Church and Social Justice. Jesuit Theological Forum Reflections.'' [[Anand, India|Anand]], [[Gujarat, India]]: Gujarat Sahitya Prakash, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and George-Soares Prabhu&lt;ref&gt;Soares-Prabhu, George, and Francis X. D'Sa. ''Theology of Liberation: An Indian Biblical Perspective.'' [[Pune, India]]: Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; enabled JDV to lead a Catholic movement toward the concerns of the poor and marginalised in Indian society. [[Sara Grant]] taught philosophy and theology at the institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monasticdialog.com/bulletins/69/grant.htm "Sara Grant - In Memoriam"] Monastic Inter-religious Dialogue, Bulletin 69, August 2002. ''Dead link'': [https://web.archive.org/web/20120310163522/http://www.monasticdialog.com/bulletins/69/grant.htm Archived version].&lt;/ref&gt;

JDV has continued in its pioneering activities in the Indian church, for more than a decade pursuing [[Catholic Church and science|dialog between science and religion]]. It offers a Masters in Science and Religion (MSPR). More practical, contextual studies in sacred scripture have seen a revival, with the addition of a master's program in contextual [[spirituality]]. Diploma and Master's Programme in [[Ignatian Spirituality]] began in the academic year 2016-17. Also, a pastoral management course was instituted for the administrative and service sector.

Lopen '''Karma Phuntsho''' was born in [[Ura, Bhutan|Ura]] gewog in the [[Bumthang District|Bumthang]] district of central Bhutan. He was born as the third child of Tothchukpo House to his mother who is a scion of Gaden Lam family which traces its origin to Phajo Drukgom Zhigpo, the priest who brought Drukpa Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism to western Bhutan. Karma learnt basic Chokey alphabets and prayers from his father, who is an incarnate priest and farmer from the Tsakaling Choje family, a religious nobility which claims descent from Bhutan's foremost spiritual saint Pema Lingpa and Tarshong Chukpo house of Ura. He attended Ura Primary School until Class III. Because the school did not have Class IV and he was too small to travel, his parents begged the headmaster to keep him in Ura and repeat. The following year, he travelled to Jakar School with a few friends. The headmaster at the new school mistakenly put Karma again in Class III. Karma today  humorously claims that he is perhaps the only person who studied in Class III for three years and received first prizes thrice. Karma spent most of his school winter breaks helping the family cow herder in the neighbouring district of Lhuntse.

In 1986, he came to Thimphu and had a short spell at [[Yangchenphug Higher Secondary School]] before leaving school to become a monk and study Buddhism at [[Chagri Monastery]]. Later, he went to south India to continue his studies spending a year at [[Sera Monastery]] then ten years at the [[Ngagyur Nyingma Institute]]  Since 1994, he has taught Buddhism and related subjects and has served a lecturer at the Ngagyur Nyingma Institute in Byallkuppe and for two years as an abbot at the [[Shugseb Nunnery]] in [[Dharamshala]].&lt;ref name="RY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Karma_Phuntsho|title=Karma Phuntsho|author=&lt;!--No by-line.--&gt;|date=|website=Rangjung Yeshe Wiki|publisher=Tsadra Foundation|accessdate=2014-11-17}} &lt;!--Note: CC BY-SA 3.0 source --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KarmaCV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31137347/Karmas_CV.pdf  |author=&lt;!--No by-line.--&gt; |title=Karma Phuntsho: Curriculum Vitae |date= |website=academia.edu |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, partly he says because young Bhutanese educated in English looked down on monks even though they were very learned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theravenmag.com/a-buddhist-practitioner-who-set-up-the-loden-foundation-karma-phuntsho-believes-that-bhutanese-society-must-now-be-more-ethically-driven/|title=A Buddhist practitioner who set up The Loden Foundation, Karma Phuntsho believes that Bhutanese society must now be more ethically driven (Interview)|date=2013-03-08|website=The Raven }}&lt;/ref&gt; he joined [[Balliol College]] Oxford and read for an M.St. in Sanskrit and Classical Indian Religions under [[Richard Gombrich]], Seyfort Ruegg and [[Michael Aris]]. In 2003, he received a D.Phil. in Buddhist Studies from [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=DrukAsia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drukasia.com/impressions/about/dr-karma-puntsho|title=About Dr. Karma Phuntsho|author=|date= |website=  |accessdate=2014-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a post-doctoral researcher in [[CNRS]], Paris and as a Research Associate in the Department of Social Anthropology, Cambridge University. He was also the Spalding Fellow in Comparative Religions at Clare Hall and ran The Historical Study and Documentation of the Pad Gling Traditions in Bhutan project subsequently he spent years creating a digital archive of rare Bhutanese manuscripts. Dr Phuntsho is the first Bhutanese to receive a D.Phil from Oxford and the first Bhutanese to become an Oxbridge Fellow.  
In Bhutan he has founded the [[Loden Foundation]], a charity to promote education and entrepreneurship in Bhutan as well as the Shejun Agency for Bhutan's Cultural Documentation and Research.

Lopen Karma specialises in Buddhism, Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Studies and Bhutan, and has published a number of works including eight books, translations, book reviews and articles on Buddhism, Bhutan and Tibetan Studies. His ''The History of Bhutan'' RandomHouse New Delhi (2013) and University of Chicago has been called "the first book to offer a comprehensive history of Bhutan in English" and received many applauses from international readers.

'''Levi Bryant''', born '''Paul Reginald Bryant''', is a Professor of Philosophy at [[Collin College]] in the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collin College Faculty Page|url=http://www.collin.edu/philosophy/faculty.htm|publisher=Collin College|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant has also written extensively about post-structural and cultural theory, including the work of [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Jacques Rancière]], and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. His [[blog]], ''Larval Subjects'', was founded in 2006 and had over 2 million hits as of September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blog Stats|url=http://www.larvalsubjects.wordpress.com|work=Larval Subjects|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to working as a professor, Bryant has also served as a Lacanian psychoanalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ennis|first=Paul|title=Interview with Levi Bryant|url=http://anotherheideggerblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/interview-with-levi-r-byrant.html|work=Another Heidegger Blog|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Bryant became interested in philosophy as a teenager, after struggling through personal turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ennis|first=Paul|title=Post-Continental Voices|year=2010|publisher=Zero Books|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-84694-385-0|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] in Chicago, Illinois, where he originally intended to study '[[World disclosure|disclosedness]]' with the Heidegger scholar Thomas Sheehan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ennis|first=Paul|title=Post-Continental Voices|year=2010|publisher=Zero Books|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-84694-385-0|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bryant later changed his dissertation topic to the transcendental empiricism of [[Gilles Deleuze]], with his analysis becoming the basis of his first book, ''Difference and Givenness: Deleuze's Transcendental Empiricism and the Ontology of Immanence'', published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Protevi|first=John|title=New APPS Interview: levi Bryant|url=http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/05/new-apps-interview-levi-bryant.html|accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
He was a member of the object-oriented philosophy movement and coined the term [[object-oriented ontology]] in 2009 to distinguish positions that are committed to the thesis that beings are composed of things from [[Graham Harman]]'s object-oriented philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harman|first=Graham|title=Brief SR/OOO Tutorial|url=http://doctorzamalek2.wordpress.com/2010/07/23/brief-srooo-tutorial/|work=Object-Oriented Philosophy|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His own version of object-oriented thought, called '[[onticology]]', disprivileges human experience from a central position in metaphysical inquiry, while holding that objects are always split between two domains, ''virtuality'' and ''actuality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Potentiality and Onticology|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/potentiality-and-onticology/|work=Larval Subjects|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Bryant, ''virtuality'' refers to the powers and potential of any given object, whereas ''actuality'' designates the qualities manifested by the actualization of an object's potential at any given point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=A Lexicon of Onticology|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/a-lexicon-of-onticology/|work=Larval Subjects|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Bryant, concerned with the doctrine of withdrawal and the non-relationism of object-oriented philosophy, departed from the object-oriented ontology movement and developed a machine-oriented ontology that argues being is composed entirely of machines or processes.

===Onticology===
Like other object-oriented ontologists, Bryant opposes the [[anthropocentrism]] of the [[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Copernican Revolution]] proposed by [[Immanuel Kant]], wherein objects are said to conform to the mind of the subject and, in turn, become products of human cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Onticology–A Manifesto for Object-Oriented Ontology, Part 1|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/object-oriented-ontology-a-manifesto-part-i/|work=Larval Subjects|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From Bryant's perspective, the Kantian contention that reality is inaccessible to human knowledge because it is structured by human cognition limits philosophy to a self-reflexive analysis of the mechanisms and institutions through which cognition structures reality. He states:

{{quote| For, in effect, the Copernican Revolution will reduce philosophical investigation to the interrogation of a ''single'' relation: the human-world gap. And indeed, in the reduction of philosophy to the interrogation of this single relation or gap, not only will there be excessive focus on how humans relate to the world to the detriment of anything else, but this interrogation will be profoundly ''asymmetrical''. For the world or the object related to through the agency of the human will becomes a mere prop or vehicle for human cognition, language, and intentions ''without contributing anything of its own''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Onticology–A Manifesto for Object-Oriented Ontology, Part 1|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/object-oriented-ontology-a-manifesto-part-i/|work=Larval Subjects|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To counter the form of post-Kantian epistemology, Bryant articulates an object-oriented philosophy called '[[onticology]]', grounded in three principles. First, the ''Ontic Principle'' states that "there is no difference that does not make a difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Levi; Harman, Graham; Srnicek, Nick|title=The Speculative Turn: Continental Materialism and Realism|year=2011|publisher=re.press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=978-0-9806683-4-6|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following from the premises that questions of difference precede epistemological interrogation and that to be is to produce differences, this principle posits that knowledge cannot be fixed prior to engagement with difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Levi; Harman, Graham; Srnicek, Nick|title=The Speculative Turn: Continental Materialism and Realism|year=2011|publisher=re.press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=978-0-9806683-4-6|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, for Bryant, the thesis that things-in-themselves exist outside the boundaries of knowledge is untenable because it presupposes forms of being that make no differences. Similarly, concepts of difference predicated upon negation&amp;mdash;that which objects are not or lack when placed in comparison with one another&amp;mdash;are dismissed as arising only from the perspective of consciousness, rather than an ontological difference that affirms independent being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Levi; Harman, Graham; Srnicek, Nick|title=The Speculative Turn: Continental Materialism and Realism|year=2011|publisher=re.press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=978-0-9806683-4-6|pages=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, the ''Principle of the Inhuman'' asserts that the concept of difference producing difference is not restricted to human, sociocultural, or epistemological domains, thereby marking the being of difference as independent of knowledge and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Levi; Harman, Graham; Srnicek, Nick|title=The Speculative Turn: Continental Materialism and Realism|year=2011|publisher=re.press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=978-0-9806683-4-6|pages=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Humans exist as difference-making beings among other difference-making beings, therefore, without holding any special position with respect to other differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Levi; Harman, Graham; Srnicek, Nick|title=The Speculative Turn: Continental Materialism and Realism|year=2011|publisher=re.press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=978-0-9806683-4-6|pages=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Third, the ''Ontological Principle'' maintains that if there is no difference that does not also make a difference, then the making of difference is the minimal condition for the existence of being. In Bryant's words, "if a difference is made, then the being is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Levi; Harman, Graham; Srnicek, Nick|title=The Speculative Turn: Continental Materialism and Realism|year=2011|publisher=re.press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=978-0-9806683-4-6|pages=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bryant further contends that differences produced by an object can be ''inter-ontic'' (made with respect to another object) or ''intra-ontic'' (pertaining the internal constitution of the object).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Levi; Harman, Graham; Srnicek, Nick|title=The Speculative Turn: Continental Materialism and Realism|year=2011|publisher=re.press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=978-0-9806683-4-6|pages=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since onticology construes anything that produces differences&amp;mdash;including fictions, signs, animals, and plants&amp;mdash;as being equally real, albeit at different scales, it is what Manuel Delanda has called a "flat ontology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delanda|first=Manuel|title=Intensive Science &amp; Virtual Philosophy|year=2002|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|isbn=0-8264-7932-4|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within an onticological framework, objects are composed of differences coalescing into a system that reproduces itself through time. Changes in the identity of an object are not changes in substance (defined by Bryant as "a particular state attained by difference"), however, but shifts in the qualities belonging to a substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Levi; Harman, Graham; Srnicek, Nick|title=The Speculative Turn: Continental Materialism and Realism|year=2011|publisher=re.press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=978-0-9806683-4-6|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Qualities are the actualization of an object's inhered capacities or abilities, known as an object's ''powers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Objects and Powers|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/objects-and-powers/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actualization of an object's power into qualities or properties at a specific place and time is called ''local manifestation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=The Mug Blues|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/the-mug-blues/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Importantly, the occurrence of local manifestations does not require observation. In this way, qualities comprise ''actuality'', referring to the actualization of an object's potential at a particular spatiotemporal location among a multitude of material differences, whereas powers constitute ''virtuality'', or the potential retained by an object across time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Potentiality and Onticology|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/potentiality-and-onticology/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As objects are distinct from local manifestations and one another, referred to as ''withdrawal'', their being is defined by the relations forming their internal structure, or ''endo-relations'', and retained powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=A Lexicon of Onticology|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/a-lexicon-of-onticology/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This withdrawn being is known as the ''virtual proper being'' of an object and denotes its enduring, unified substantiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=The Mug Blues|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/the-mug-blues/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When relations external to an object, or ''exo-relations'', consistently induce the same local manifestations to the extent that the actualization of qualities tends toward stability (for example, the sky remaining blue because of the constancy of [[Rayleigh scattering]] on atmospheric particles), the set of relations forms a ''regime of attraction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Regimes of Attraction|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2010/05/20/regimes-of-attraction/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onticology distinguishes between four different types of objects: Bright objects, dim objects, dark objects, and rogue objects. ''Bright objects'' are objects that strongly manifest themselves and heavily impact other objects, such as the ubiquity of cell phones in high-tech cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffield|first=Kris|title=Interview: Levi Bryant|url=http://fracturedpolitics.com/2011/06/29/interview-levi-bryant.aspx|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Dim objects'' lightly manifest themselves in an assemblage of objects; for example, a neutrino passing through solid matter without producing observable effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffield|first=Kris|title=Interview: Levi Bryant|url=http://fracturedpolitics.com/2011/06/29/interview-levi-bryant.aspx|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Dark objects'' are objects that are so completely withdrawn that they produce no local manifestations and do not affect any other objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Dark Objects|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/dark-objects/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Rogue objects'' are not chained to any given assemblage of objects, but instead wander in and out of assemblages, modifying relations within the assemblages into which they enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Rogue Objects|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/rogue-objects/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Political protestors exemplify rogue objects by breaking with the norms and relations of a dominant political assemblage in order to forge new relations that challenge, change, or cast off the prior assemblage.

Additionally, Bryant has proposed the concept of 'wilderness ontology' to explain the philosophical pluralization of agency away from human privilege. For Bryant, wilderness ontology alludes to the being of being, or common essence "characteristic of all entities and their relations to one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffery|first=Celina|title=Preternatural|year=2011|publisher=Punctum Books|location=Brooklyn, New York|isbn=978-1-105-24502-2|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Resisting the traditional notion of wilderness that views civilization (the "inside" world of social relations, language, and norms) as separate from wilderness (the "outside" world of plants, animals, and nature), wilderness ontology argues that "wilderness" contains all forms of being, including civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffery|first=Celina|title=Preternatural|year=2011|publisher=Punctum Books|location=Brooklyn, New York|isbn=978-1-105-24502-2|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, the practice of wilderness ontology involves experiencing oneself as a being amongst, rather than above, other beings. In generalizing the agential alterity of being as a foundational ontological principle, Bryant posits three theses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffery|first=Celina|title=Preternatural|year=2011|publisher=Punctum Books|location=Brooklyn, New York|isbn=978-1-105-24502-2|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First, wilderness ontology signals the absence of ontological hierarchy, such that all forms of being exist on equal footing with one another. Second, wilderness ontology rejects the topological bifurcation of nature and culture into discrete domains, instead holding that cultural assemblages are only one possible set of relations into which nonhuman entities may enter in the wilderness. Third, wilderness ontology extends agency to all entities, human and nonhuman, rather than casting nonhuman entities as passive recipients of human meaning projection. Employing these theses, Bryant pluralizes agential being beyond human finitude, contending that in so doing, the intentionality of the nonhuman world may be investigated without reference to human intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffery|first=Celina|title=Preternatural|year=2011|publisher=Punctum Books|location=Brooklyn, New York|isbn=978-1-105-24502-2|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, European and American [[logic]]ians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for '''logic and dialectic''' through formalisation,&lt;ref name="Eemeren"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eemeren |first1=Frans H. van |last2=Garssen |first2=Bart |last3=Krabbe |first3=Erik C.

==History==
There have been pre-formal and partially-formal treatises on argument and [[dialectic]], from authors such as [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Uses of Argument''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toulmin |first=Stephen |date=2003 |origyear=1958 |title=The uses of argument |edition=Updated |location=Cambridge, UK; New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521827485 |oclc=51607421 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511840005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hitchcock |editor1-first=David |editor2-last=Verheij |editor2-first=Bart |date=2006 |title=Arguing on the Toulmin model: new essays in argument analysis and evaluation |series=Argumentation library |volume=10 |location=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=1402049374 |oclc=82229075 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4938-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eemeren"/&gt;{{rp|203–256}} [[Nicholas Rescher]] (''Dialectics''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Stephen|title=Nicholas Rescher: Philosophical Dialectics|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25075-philosophical-dialectics-an-essay-on-metaphilosophy/|date=2006|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|issue=2006.07.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Jacquette|editor-first=Dale|title=Reason, Method, and Value: A Reader on the Philosophy of Nicholas Rescher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T65moyMMioYC|date=2009|location=Frankfurt|publisher=Ontos Verlag|doi=10.1515/9783110329056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eemeren"/&gt;{{rp|330–336}} and van Eemeren and Grootendorst ([[pragma-dialectics]]).&lt;ref name="Eemeren"/&gt;{{rp|517–614}} One can include works of the communities of [[informal logic]] and [[paraconsistent logic]].&lt;ref name="Eemeren"/&gt;{{rp|373–424}}

==Defeasibility==
However, building on theories of [[defeasible reasoning]] (see [[John L. Pollock]]), systems have been built that define well-formedness of arguments, rules governing the process of introducing arguments based on fixed assumptions, and rules for shifting burden. Many of these logics appear in the special area of [[artificial intelligence and law]], though the computer scientists' interest in formalizing dialectic originates in a desire to build [[decision support]] and computer-supported collaborative work systems.&lt;ref&gt;For surveys of work in this area see, for example: {{cite journal |last1=Chesñevar |first1=Carlos Iván |last2=Maguitman |first2=Ana Gabriela |last3=Loui |first3=Ronald Prescott |date=December 2000 |title=Logical models of argument |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=337–383 |doi=10.1145/371578.371581}} And: {{cite book |last1=Prakken |first1=Henry |last2=Vreeswijk |first2=Gerard |date=2005 |chapter=Logics for defeasible argumentation |editor1-last=Gabbay |editor1-first=Dov M. |editor2-last=Guenthner |editor2-first=Franz |title=Handbook of philosophical logic |edition=2nd |volume=4 |location=Dordrecht; Boston |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |pages=219–318 |isbn=9789048158775 |doi=10.1007/978-94-017-0456-4_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialog games==
{{main|Game semantics}}
Dialectic itself can be formalised as moves in a game, where an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an opponent argue.{{Cn|date=July 2017}} Such games can provide a [[semantics of logic]], one that is very general in applicability.

'''Michael Joseph Oakeshott''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|k|ʃ|ɒ|t}}; 11 December 1901 – 19 December 1990) was an English [[philosopher]] and [[political theory|political theorist]] who wrote about [[philosophy of history]], [[philosophy of religion]], [[aesthetics]], [[philosophy of education]], and [[philosophy of law]].&lt;ref name=political_theory_journal&gt;Fuller, T. (1991) 'The Work of Michael Oakeshott', ''Political Theory'', Vol. 19 No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Oakeshott was the son of Frances Maude (Hellicar) and Joseph Francis Oakeshott, a [[civil servant]] and a member of the [[Fabian Society]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=8042&amp;inst_id=1&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw]] was a friend. Michael Oakeshott attended [[St George's School, Harpenden]], from 1912 to 1920. He enjoyed his schooldays, and the Headmaster, Cecil Grant, later became a friend. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 1920 Oakeshott became an undergraduate at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], where he read history. He obtained an MA and subsequently became a Fellow. While he was at Cambridge he admired the [[British idealist]] philosophers [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] and [[John Grote]], and the medieval historian [[Zachary Nugent Brooke]]. The historian [[Herbert Butterfield]] was a contemporary and fellow member of the Junior Historians society.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===1930s===
Oakeshott was dismayed by the political extremism that occurred in Europe during the 1930s, and his surviving lectures from this period reveal a dislike of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;See M. Oakeshott, Review of H. Levy and others, ''Aspects of Dialectical Materialism'', in ''Cambridge Review'', 56 (1934–5), pp. 108–9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
Although Oakeshott, in his essay "The Claim of Politics" (1939), defended the right of individuals not to become directly involved, in 1941 he joined the [[British Army]]. He reportedly wished to join the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), but the military decided that his appearance was "too unmistakably English" for him to conduct covert operations on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=John|title=Last of the Idealists|url=http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/gray_07_14.php|website=Literary Review|accessdate=23 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717092255/http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/gray_07_14.php|archivedate=17 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on active service in Europe with the intelligence unit [[GHQ Liaison Regiment|Phantom]], which had connections with the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), but he was never in the front line.

===Postwar===
In 1945 Oakeshott was demobilized and returned to Cambridge. In 1947 he left Cambridge for [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], but after only a year there he secured an appointment as Professor of Political Science at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), succeeding the leftist [[Harold Laski]]. He was deeply unsympathetic to the student activism at LSE during the late 1960s, on the grounds that it disrupted the work of the university. Oakeshott retired from the LSE in 1969.

In his retirement he retreated to live quietly in a country cottage in [[Langton Matravers]] in [[Dorset]]. He lived long enough to experience increasing recognition, although he has become much more widely written about since his death.

Oakeshott refused an offer of being made a [[Companion of Honour]], for which he was proposed by [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michael-oakeshott-association.org/aboutoak_thatcher.html |title=A Letter from Margaret Thatcher |last= |first= |date= |website=www.michael-oakeshott-association.org |publisher= |access-date=2016-12-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526060822/http://www.michael-oakeshott-association.org/aboutoak_thatcher.html |archivedate=26 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

===Early works===
{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}
Oakeshott's early work, some of which has been published posthumously as ''What is History? And Other Essays'' (2004) and ''The Concept of a Philosophical Jurisprudence'' (2007), shows that he was more interested in the philosophical problems that derived from his historical studies than he was in the history, even though he was employed as a historian.

===Philosophy and modes of experience===
Oakeshott published his first book, ''Experience and its Modes'', in 1933. He noted that the book owed much to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[F. H. Bradley]];&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, ''Experience and Its Modes'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; commentators also noticed resemblances between this work and the ideas of thinkers such as [[R. G. Collingwood]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Franco, ''Michael Oakeshott: An Introduction'', pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Simmel]].&lt;ref&gt;Efraim Podoksik, ‘Ethics and the Conduct of Life in the old Georg Simmel and the young Michael Oakeshott’, ''Simmel Studies'' 17(2), 2007, pp. 197–221&lt;/ref&gt;

The book argued that our experience is usually modal, in the sense that we always have a governing perspective on the world, be it practical or theoretical. There are various theoretical approaches one may take to understanding the world: [[natural science]] and history for example are separate modes of experience. It was a mistake, he declared, to treat history as if it ought to be practised on the model of the natural sciences.

Philosophy, however, is not a modal interest. At this stage of his career, he saw philosophy as the world seen ''sub specie aeternitatis'', literally, 'under the aspect of eternity', free from presuppositions, whereas science and history and the practical mode relied on certain assumptions. Later (there is some disagreement about exactly when), Oakeshott adopted a pluralistic view of the various modes of experience, with philosophy just one 'voice' amongst others, though it retained its self-scrutinizing character.

The dominating principles of scientific and historical thought were quantity (the world ''sub specie quantitatis'') and being in the past (the world ''sub specie praeteritorum''), respectively. Oakeshott distinguished the academic perspective on the past from the practical, in which the past is seen in terms of its relevance to ''our'' present and future. His insistence on the autonomy of history places him close to Collingwood, who also argued for the autonomy of historical knowledge.

The practical world view (the world ''sub specie voluntatis'') presupposed the ideas of will and of value in terms of which practical action in the arenas of politics, economics, and ethics made sense. Because all action is conditioned by presuppositions, Oakeshott was inclined to see any attempt to change the world as reliant upon a scale of values, which themselves presuppose a context of experience. Even the conservative disposition to maintain the status quo relies upon managing inevitable change, he would later elaborate in his essay 'On Being Conservative'.

===Post-war essays===
{{Conservatism sidebar |People}}
During this period Oakeshott published what became his best known work during his lifetime, the collection entitled ''Rationalism in Politics and Other Essays'' (1962). Some of the polemics against the direction post-[[World War II]] Britain was taking, in particular the acceptance of [[socialism]], gained Oakeshott a reputation as a conservative, seeking to uphold the importance of tradition, and sceptical about [[rationalism]] and fixed [[ideology|ideologies]]. [[Bernard Crick]] described him as a 'lonely [[Nihilism|nihilist]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Crick, ‘The World of Michael Oakeshott: Or the Lonely Nihilist’, ''Encounter'', 20 (June 1963), pp. 65–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakeshott's opposition to what he considered Utopian political projects is summed by his use of the analogy (possibly borrowed from the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], a 17th-century English author whom he admired) of a ship of state which has "neither starting-place nor appointed destination...[and where] the enterprise is to keep afloat on an even keel".&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, Michael. ''Rationalism in Politics''. London: Methuen, 1962: p. 127; [https://books.google.com/books?id=2YbevnCXAhgC&amp;pg=PA120]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a critic of the Cambridge historian [[E. H. Carr]], historian of Soviet Russia, claiming that Carr had an uncritical attitude towards the [[Bolshevik]] regime, taking some of its propaganda at face value.&lt;ref&gt;M. Oakeshott, Review of E. H. Carr, ''The New Society'', in ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 1951)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''On Human Conduct'' and Oakeshott's political theory===
In his essay "On Being Conservative" (1956)&lt;ref&gt;''Rationalism in Politics and Other Essays'' (London: Methuen,1962), pp. 168–96&lt;/ref&gt; Oakeshott explained what he regarded as the conservative disposition: "To be conservative ... is to prefer the familiar to the unknown, to prefer the tried to the untried, fact to mystery, the actual to the possible, the limited to the unbounded, the near to the distant, the sufficient to the superabundant, the convenient to the perfect, present laughter to utopian bliss."

Oakeshott's political philosophy, as advanced in ''On Human Conduct'' (1975), is free of any form of [[political party|party politics]]. The book's first part ("On the Theoretical Understanding of Human Conduct") develops a [[theory]] of human action as the exercise of intelligent [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] in activities such as wanting and choosing, the second ("On the Civil Condition") discusses the formal conditions of association appropriate to such intelligent agents, described as "civil" or legal association, and the third ("On the Character of a Modern European State") examines how far this understanding of human association has affected politics and political ideas in post-Renaissance [[European history]].

Oakeshott suggests that there had been two major modes or understandings of human social organization. In the first, which he calls "enterprise association" (or ''universitas''), the state is understood as imposing some universal purpose ([[Profit (economics)|profit]], [[salvation]], progress, racial domination) on its subjects. By contrast, "civil association" (or ''societas'') is primarily a legal relationship in which laws impose obligatory conditions of action but do not require choosing one action rather than another.

The complex, often technical style of ''On Human Conduct'' found few readers, and its initial reception was mostly one of bafflement.  Oakeshott, who rarely responded to critics, used an article in the journal ''Political Theory'' to reply sardonically to some of the contributions made at a symposium on the book.&lt;ref&gt;M. Oakeshott, "On Misunderstanding Human Conduct: A Reply to My Critics," ''Political Theory'', 4 (1976), pp. 353–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his posthumously-published ''The Politics of Faith and the Politics of Scepticism'', Oakeshott describes enterprise and civil association in different terms. Here, an enterprise association is seen as based in a fundamental faith in human ability to ascertain and grasp some universal "good" (i.e. the Politics of Faith), and civil association is seen as based in a fundamental scepticism about human ability to either ascertain or achieve this good (i.e. the Politics of Scepticism). Oakeshott considers power (especially technological power) as a necessary prerequisite for the Politics of Faith, because a) it allows people to believe they can achieve something great (e.g. something universally good), and b) it allows them to implement the policies necessary to achieve their goal. The Politics of Scepticism, on the other hand, rests on the idea that government should concern itself with preventing bad things from happening rather than enabling ambiguously good events.

Oakeshott employs the analogy of the [[adverb]] to describe the kind of restraint law involves. To him, laws prescribe "adverbial conditions": they condition our actions, but do not determine the substantive ends of our choices. For example, the law against murder is not a law against killing as such, but only a law against killing "murderously". Or, to choose a more trivial example, the law does not dictate that I have a car, but if I do, I must drive it on the same side of the road as everybody else. This contrasts with the rules of enterprise association in which those actions required by the governing are made compulsory for all.

===Philosophy of history===
The final work Oakeshott published in his own lifetime, ''On History'' (1983) returned to the idea that history is a distinct mode of experience, but built on the theory of action developed for ''On Human Conduct''. Much of ''On History'' had in fact been written at the same time, in the early 1970s.

During the mid-1960s, Oakeshott declared an admiration for [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], one of the pioneers of [[hermeneutics]]. ''On History'' can be interpreted as an essentially [[neo-Kantian]] enterprise of working out the conditions of the possibility of historical knowledge, work that Dilthey had begun.

The first three essays set out the distinction between the present of historical experience and the present of practical experience, as well as the concepts of historical situation, historical event, and what is meant by change in history. ''On History'' includes an essay on [[jurisprudence]] ('The Rule of Law'). It also included a retelling of ''[[The Tower of Babel]]'' in a modern setting&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted as {{cite book |last=Oakeshott |first=Michael |chapter=The tower of Babel |editor-last=Clarke | editor-first=S.G. | editor-last2=Simpson | editor-first2=E. | title=Anti-Theory in Ethics and Moral Conservatism | publisher=State University of New York Press | series=SUNY Series in Ethical Theory | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-88706-912-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnOMf9Yr0kgC&amp;pg=PA185 | access-date=25 May 2018 | page=185ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Oakeshott expresses disdain for human willingness to sacrifice individuality, culture, and quality of life for grand collective projects. He attributes this behaviour to fascination with novelty, persistent dissatisfaction, greed, and lack of self-reflection.&lt;ref name="Corey 2006 p. 130"&gt;{{cite book | last=Corey | first=E.C. | title=Michael Oakeshott on Religion, Aesthetics, and Politics | publisher=University of Missouri Press | series=Eric Voegelin Institute series in political philosophy | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-8262-6517-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QdCmqFe3a4C&amp;pg=PA130 | page=129-131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
Oakeshott's other works included a reader on ''The Social and Political Doctrines of Contemporary Europe'' consisting of selected texts illustrating the main doctrines of [[liberalism]], [[Nazism|national socialism]], [[fascism]], [[communism]], and [[Roman Catholicism]] (1939). He was editor of an edition of [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1946), for which he provided an introduction recognized as a significant contribution to the literature by later scholars such as [[Quentin Skinner]]. Several of his essays on Hobbes were published during 1975 as ''Hobbes on Civil Association''. He wrote, with his Cambridge colleague [[Guy Griffith]], ''A Guide to the Classics, or How to Pick The Derby Winner'' (1936), a guide to the principles of successful betting on horse-racing; this was his only non-academic work. He was the author of well over 150 essays and reviews, most of which have yet to be republished.

Just before he died, Oakeshott approved two edited collections of his works, ''The Voice of Liberal Learning'' (1989), a collection of his essays on education, and a second, revised and expanded edition of ''Rationalism in Politics'' itself (1991). Posthumous collections of his writings include ''Morality and Politics in Modern Europe'' (1993), a lecture series he gave at [[Harvard]] in 1958, ''Religion, Politics, and the Moral Life'' (1993), essays mostly from his early and middle periods, ''The Politics of Faith and the Politics of Scepticism'' (1996), a manuscript from the 1950s contemporary with much of the material in ''Rationalism in Politics'' but written in a more considered tone.

The bulk of his papers are now in the Oakeshott archive at the [[London School of Economics]]. Further volumes of posthumous writings are in preparation, as is a biography, and during the first decade of the 21st century a series of monographs devoted to his work were published.

'''Nicholas C. Burbules''' is a Gutgsell Endowed Professor of Education Policy, Organization and Leadership and an affiliate of the Unit for Criticism and Interpretative Theory at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].  He is the director of the Ubiquitous Learning Institute and has served as Editor of the journal ''Educational Theory'' since 1991.{{Cn|date=September 2014}}

==Education==
Nicholas Burbules earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Religious Studies from Grinnell College in 1975, a Master of Arts degree in Philosophy from Stanford University in 1979, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Philosophy of Education from Stanford University in 1983.{{Cn|date=September 2014}}

==Work==
Nicholas Burbules has been a professor in the Department of Education Policy, Organization and Leadership since 1989 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Prior to his work at the University of Illinois, Burbules was a professor in the Department of Educational Studies at the University of Utah.{{Cn|date=September 2014}}

Nicholas Burbules served as Editor of ''Educational Theory'' for more than twenty years, from 1992-2013, helped establish ''[[Education Review]]'' in 1998, and served as President of the Philosophy of Education Society in 2001.  Burbules's publications include six books, eight edited books, and over 130 journal articles or book chapters on topics including [[dialogue]], [[ethics]], [[technology]], [[educational research]], [[critical theory]], [[educational psychology]], [[social philosophy]], and [[political philosophy]]. He has been an invited to speak in over ten countries on the topic of technology in education.{{Cn|date=September 2014}}

Nicholas Burbules' most recent work centers on Ubiquitous Learning, a concept that draws out the emergence of "any time, anywhere" learning potential made possible by increased use of handheld and portable devices, along with pervasive [[wireless networking]]. This involves a shift in ubiquity, as the traditional divide between formal and informal contexts of learning breaks down. Technological as well as social, cultural, and institutional changes mean that learning is a continuous possibility across spatial and temporal barriers. Learners of all ages expect, and often need, structured learning opportunities in a "just in time" mode; this puts new meaning and vitality into the traditional idea of "lifelong learning."{{Cn|date=September 2014}}

Burbules opposes the unionization of tenure track faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and is a contributing author at the blog “No Faculty Union at Illinois.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In an August 2014 op-ed piece, Burbules and Joyce Tolliver expressed opposition toward critics of the University of Illinois's decision not to fulfill its commitment to hire Dr. Steven Salaita, a scholar known to be sympathetic to Palestinians and critical of the Israeli government.{{Cn|date=September 2014}} Burbules and Tolliver contended that critics of the decision did not wait until all information about the case was available. Now, with more facts about the situation, Burbules and Tolliver argued that there are two central questions to be considered. First is whether Salaita's comments, deemed "strident and vulgar" by the Illinois branch of the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP), were protected by academic freedom, a position affirmatively taken by the Illinois AAUP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Herman Northrop Frye''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|FRSC}} (July 14, 1912 &amp;ndash; January 23, 1991) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]]  [[literary critic]] and [[literary theorist]], considered one of the most influential of the 20th century.

Frye gained international fame with his first book, ''[[Fearful Symmetry (Frye)|Fearful Symmetry]]'' (1947), which led to the reinterpretation of the poetry of [[William Blake]]. His lasting reputation rests principally on the theory of literary criticism that he developed in ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'' (1957), one of the most important works of literary theory published in the twentieth century. The American critic [[Harold Bloom]] commented at the time of its publication that ''Anatomy'' established Frye as "the foremost living student of Western literature."&lt;ref&gt;Forst, G.N.

===Early life and education===
Born in [[Sherbrooke]], [[Quebec]], but raised in [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]], Frye was the third child of Herman Edward Frye and of Catherine Maud Howard.&lt;ref name = Guide&gt;University of Toronto.

&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to Victoria College, where he spent the remainder of his professional career.

===Academic and writing career===
Frye rose to international prominence as a result of his first book, ''[[Fearful Symmetry (Frye)|Fearful Symmetry]]'', published in 1947. Until then, the prophetic poetry of [[William Blake]] had long been poorly understood, and considered by some to be delusional ramblings. Frye found in it a system of metaphor derived from ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' and the [[Bible]]. His study of Blake's poetry was a major contribution. Moreover, Frye outlined an innovative manner of studying literature that was to deeply influence the study of literature in general. He was a major influence on [[Harold Bloom]], [[Margaret Atwood]], and others.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 1974–1975 Frye was the Norton professor at [[Harvard University]].

Northrop Frye did not have a Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://figureground.ca/interviews/b-w-powe/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701091351/http://figureground.ca/interviews/b-w-powe/ |archivedate=2012-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intelligence service of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] spied on Frye, watching his participation in the anti-Vietnam War movement, an academic forum about China, and activism to end South African apartheid.&lt;ref name=RCMP&gt;{{cite news|title=RCMP spied on Northrop Frye|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/rcmp-spied-on-northrop-frye-1.1105512|accessdate=26 September 2014|agency=CBC News|publisher=|date=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family life===
Frye married Helen Kemp, an educator, editor and artist, in 1937. She died in Australia while accompanying Frye on a lecture tour.&lt;ref&gt;University of Toronto.

==Contribution to literary criticism==
The insights gained from his study of [[William Blake|Blake]] set Frye on his critical path and shaped his contributions to [[literary criticism]] and theory. He was the first critic to postulate a systematic theory of criticism, "to work out," in his own words, "a unified commentary on the theory of literary criticism" (''Stubborn Structure'' 160). In so doing, he shaped the discipline of criticism. Inspired by his work on Blake, Frye developed and articulated his unified theory ten years after ''Fearful Symmetry'', in the ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'' (1957). He described this as an attempt at a "synoptic view of the scope, theory, principles, and techniques of literary criticism" (''Anatomy'' 3). He asked, "what if criticism is a science as well as an art?" (7), Thus, Frye launched the pursuit which was to occupy the rest of his career—that of establishing criticism as a "coherent field of study which trains the imagination quite as systematically and efficiently as the sciences train the reason" (Hamilton 34).

===Criticism as a science===
As A. C. Hamilton outlines in ''Northrop Frye: Anatomy of his Criticism'', Frye's assumption of coherence for literary 
criticism carries important implications. Firstly and most fundamentally, it presupposes that literary criticism is a discipline in its own right, independent of literature. Claiming with [[John Stuart Mill]] that "the artist . . . is not heard but overheard," Frye insists that

&lt;blockquote&gt;The axiom of criticism must be, not that the poet does not know what he is talking about, but that he cannot talk about what he knows. To defend the right of criticism to exist at all, therefore, is to assume that criticism is a structure of thought and knowledge existing in its own right, with some measure of independence from the art it deals with (''Anatomy'' 5).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This "declaration of independence" (Hart xv) is necessarily a measured one for Frye. For coherence requires that the autonomy of criticism, the need to eradicate its conception as "a parasitic form of literary expression, . . . a second-hand imitation of creative power" (''Anatomy'' 3), sits in dynamic tension with the need to establish integrity for it as a discipline. For Frye, this kind of coherent, critical integrity involves claiming a body of knowledge for criticism that, while independent of literature, is yet constrained by it: "If criticism exists," he declares, "it must be an examination of literature in terms of a conceptual framework derivable from an inductive survey of the literary field" itself (''Anatomy'' 7).

===Frye's conceptual framework for literature===
In seeking integrity for criticism, Frye rejects what he termed the deterministic fallacy.  He defines this as the movement of "a scholar with a special interest in geography or economics [to] express . . . that interest by the rhetorical device of putting his favorite study into a causal relationship with whatever interests him less" (''Anatomy'' 6). By attaching criticism to an external framework rather than locating the framework for criticism within literature, this kind of critic essentially "substitute[s] a critical attitude for criticism." For Frye critical integrity means that "the axioms and postulates of criticism . . . have to grow out of the art it deals with" (''Anatomy'' 6).

[[File:Northrop Frye Hall.JPG|thumb|Northrop Frye Hall, University of Toronto]]
Taking his cue from [[Aristotle]], Frye's methodology in defining a conceptual framework begins inductively, "follow[ing] the natural order and begin[ning] with the primary facts" (''Anatomy'' 15). The primary facts, in this case, are the works of literature themselves. And what did Frye's inductive survey of these "facts" reveal? Significantly, they revealed "a general tendency on the part of great classics to revert to [primitive formulas]" (''Anatomy'' 17). This revelation prompted his next move, or rather, 'inductive leap':
&lt;blockquote&gt;I suggest that it is time for criticism to leap to a new ground from which it can discover what the organizing or containing forms of its conceptual framework are. Criticism seems to be badly in need of a coordinating
principle, a central hypothesis which, like the theory of evolution in biology, will see the phenomena it deals with as parts of a whole (''Anatomy'' 16).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Arguing that "criticism cannot be a systematic [and thus scientific] study unless there is a quality in literature which enables it to be so," Frye puts forward the hypothesis that "just as there is an order of nature behind the natural sciences, so literature is not a piled aggregate of 'works,' but an order of words" (''Anatomy'' 17). This order of words constitutes criticism's conceptual framework, its coordinating principle.

===The order of words===
The recurring primitive formulas Frye noticed in his survey of the "greatest classics" provide literature with an order of words, a "skeleton" which allows the reader "to respond imaginatively to any literary work by seeing it in the larger perspective provided by its literary and social contexts" (Hamilton 20). Frye identifies these formulas as the "conventional [[Mythology|myths]] and metaphors" which he calls "[[archetype]]s" (''Spiritus Mundi'' 118).  The archetypes of literature exist, Frye argues, as an order of words, providing criticism with a conceptual framework and a body of knowledge derived not from an ideological system but rooted in the imagination itself. Thus, rather than interpreting literary works from some ideological 'position' — what Frye calls the "superimposed critical attitude" (''Anatomy'' 7) — criticism instead finds integrity within the literary field itself.

Criticism for Frye, then, is not a task of evaluation — that is, of rejecting or accepting a literary work — but rather simply of recognizing it for what it is and understanding it in relation to other works within the 'order of words' &lt;ref name="Cotrupi"&gt;Cotrupi, Caterina N.,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=rh8gcNF9YXkC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=cotrupi+vico&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kwea4s28Dn&amp;sig=Psyh3_nzRP8z1JZAzA59TG95S7A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cRclTN26NMGC8gblkOn8Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cotrupi%20vico&amp;f=false Northrop Frye and the Poetics of Process] (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000.) {{ISBN|978-0-8020-8141-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Cotrupi 4). Imposing value judgments on literature belongs, according to Frye, "only to the history of taste, and therefore follows the vacillations of fashionable prejudice" (''Anatomy'' 9). Genuine criticism "progresses toward making the whole of literature intelligible" (''Anatomy'' 9) so that its goal is ultimately knowledge and not evaluation. For the critic in Frye's mode, then,

&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . a literary work should be contemplated as a pattern of knowledge, an act that must be distinguished, at least initially, from any direct experience of the work, . . . [Thus] criticism begins when reading ends: no longer imaginatively subjected to a literary work, the critic tries to make sense out of it, not by going to some historical context or by commenting on the immediate experience of reading but by seeing its structure within literature and literature within [[culture]] (Hamilton 27).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===A theory of the imagination===
Once asked whether his critical theory was [[Romanticism|Romantic]], Frye responded, "Oh, it's entirely Romantic, yes" (Stingle 1). It is Romantic in the same sense that Frye attributed Romanticism to Blake: that is, "in the expanded sense of giving a primary place to imagination and individual feeling" (Stingle 2). As artifacts of the imagination, literary works, including "the pre-literary categories of [[ritual]], [[mythology|myth]], and [[Folklore|folk-tale]]" (''Archetypes'' 1450) form, in Frye's vision, a potentially unified imaginative experience. He reminds us that literature is the "central and most important extension" of [[mythology]]: ". . . every human society possesses a mythology which is inherited, transmitted and diversified by literature" (''Words with Power'' xiii). Mythology and literature thus inhabit and function within the same imaginative world, one that is "governed by conventions, by its own modes, symbols, myths and genres" (Hart 23).  Integrity for criticism requires that it too operates within the sphere of the imagination, and not seek an organizing principle in ideology. To do so, claims Frye,
&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . leaves out the central structural principles that literature derives from myth, the principles that give literature its communicating power across the centuries through all ideological changes. Such structural principles are certainly conditioned by social and historical factors and do not transcend them, but they retain a continuity of form that points to an identity of the literary organism distinct from all its adaptations to its social environment (''Words with Power'' xiii).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Myth therefore provides structure to literature simply because literature as a whole is "displaced mythology" (Bates 21). Hart makes the point well when he states that "For Frye, the story, and not the argument, is at the centre of literature and society. The base of society is mythical and narrative and not ideological and dialectical" (19). This idea, which is central in Frye's criticism, was first suggested to him by [[Giambattista Vico]].

===Frye's critical method===
Frye uses the terms 'centripetal' and 'centrifugal' to describe his critical method. Criticism, Frye explains, is essentially centripetal when it moves inwardly, towards the structure of a text; it is centrifugal when it moves outwardly, away from the text and towards society and the outer world.  Lyric poetry, for instance, like Keats's "[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]", is dominantly centripetal, stressing the sound and movement and imagery of the ordered words. Rhetorical novels, like ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', are dominantly centrifugal, stressing the thematic connection of the stories and characters to the social order. The "Ode" has centrifugal tendencies, relying for its effects on elements of history and pottery and visual aesthetics. ''Cabin'' has centripetal tendencies, relying on syntax and lexical choice to delineate characters and establish mood. But the one veers inward, the other pushes outward. Criticism reflects these movements, centripetally focusing on the aesthetic function of literature, centrifugally on the social function of literature.

While some critics or schools of criticism emphasize one movement over the other, for Frye, both movements are essential: "criticism will always have two aspects, one turned toward the structure of literature and one turned toward the other cultural phenomena that form the social environment of literature" (''Critical Path'' 25). He would therefore agree, at least in part, with the [[New Criticism|New Critics]] of his day in their centripetal insistence on structural analysis. But for Frye this is only part of the story: "It is right," he declares, "that the first effort of critical apprehension should take the form of a rhetorical or structural analysis of a work of art. But a purely structural approach has the same limitation in criticism that it has in biology." That is, it doesn't develop "any explanation of how the structure came to be what it was and what its nearest relatives are. Structural analysis brings rhetoric back to criticism, but we need a new poetics as well . . ." (''Archetypes'' 1447).

===Archetypal criticism as "a new poetics"===
For Frye, this "new poetics" is to be found in the principle of the mythological framework, which has come to be known as 'archetypal criticism'. It is through the lens of this framework, which is essentially a centrifugal movement of backing up from the text towards the archetype, that the social function of literary criticism becomes apparent. Essentially, "what criticism can do," according to Frye, "is awaken students to successive levels of awareness of the mythology that lies behind the ideology in which their society indoctrinates them" (Stingle 4). That is, the study of recurring structural patterns grants students an emancipatory distance from their own society, and gives them a vision of a higher human state — the [[Longinus (literature)|Longinian sublime]] — that is not accessible directly through their own experience, but ultimately transforms and expands their experience, so that the poetic model becomes a model to live by. In what he terms a "kerygmatic mode," myths become "myths to live by" and metaphors "metaphors to live in," which ". . . not only work for us but constantly expand our horizons, [so that] we may enter the world of [kerygma or transformative power] and pass on to others what we have found to be true for ourselves" (''Double Vision'' 18).

Because of its important social function, Frye felt that literary criticism was an essential part of a [[liberal education]], and worked tirelessly to communicate his ideas to a wider audience. "For many years now," he wrote in 1987, "I have been addressing myself primarily, not to other critics, but to students and a nonspecialist public, realizing that whatever new directions can come to my discipline will come from their needs and their intense if unfocused vision" (''Auguries'' 7). It is therefore fitting that his last book, published posthumously, should be one that he describes as being "something of a shorter and more accessible version of the longer books, ''The Great Code'' and ''Words with Power''," which he asks his readers to read sympathetically, not "as proceeding from a judgment seat of final conviction, but from a rest stop on a pilgrimage, however near the pilgrimage may now be to its close" (''Double Vision'' Preface).

===Influences: Vico and Blake===
Vico, in ''The New Science'', posited a view of language as fundamentally figurative, and introduced into [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] discourse the notion of the role of the imagination in creating meaning. For Vico, poetic discourse is prior to philosophical discourse; [[philosophy]] is in fact derivative of [[poetry]]. Frye readily acknowledged the debt he owed to Vico in developing his literary theory, describing him as "the first modern thinker to understand that all major verbal structures have descended historically from poetic and mythological ones" (''Words with Power'' xii).

However, it was [[William Blake|Blake]], Frye's "Virgilian guide" (Stingle 1), who first awakened Frye to the "mythological frame of our culture" &lt;ref name="Cotrupi" /&gt; (Cotrupi 14). In fact, Frye claims that his "second book [''Anatomy''] was contained in embryo in the first [''Fearful Symmetry'']" (''Stubborn Structure'' 160). For it was in reflecting on the similarity between Blake and Milton that Frye first stumbled upon the "principle of the mythological framework," the recognition that "the [[Bible]] was a mythological framework, cosmos or body of stories, and that societies live within a mythology" (Hart 18). Blake thus led Frye to the conviction that the Bible provided Western societies with the mythology which informed all of Western literature. As Hamilton asserts, "Blake's claim that 'the Old and New Testaments are the Great Code of Art' became the central doctrine of all [Frye's] criticism" (39).  This 'doctrine' found its fullest expression in Frye's appropriately named ''The Great Code'', which he described as "a preliminary investigation of Biblical structure and typology" whose purpose was ultimately to suggest "how the structure of the Bible, as revealed by its narrative and imagery, was related to the conventions and genres of Western literature" (''Words with Power'' xi).

===Contribution to the theorizing of Canada===
Frye's international reputation allowed him to champion Canadian literature at a time when to do so was considered provincial. Frye argued that regardless of the formal quality of the writing, it was imperative to study Canadian literary productions in order to understand the Canadian imagination and its reaction to the Canadian environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, Frye wrote annual surveys of Canadian poetry for the ''University of Toronto Quarterly'', which led him to observe recurrent themes and preoccupations in Canadian poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In this work, Frye presented the idea of the "garrison mentality" as the attitude from which Canadian literature has been written. The garrison mentality is the attitude of a member of a community that feels isolated from cultural centres and besieged by a hostile landscape.&lt;ref name="Frye 1965 342"&gt;{{cite book

Frye collected his disparate writings on Canadian writing and painting in [[The Bush Garden: Essays on the Canadian Imagination]] (1971). He coined phrases like "the Garrison Mentality", a theme that summarizes Canadian Literature. Margaret Atwood adopted his approach and elaborated on this in her book [[Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature|Survival]] (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Marc A. Bauch: ''Canadian Self-Perception and Self-Representation in English-Canadian Drama after 1967.'' Wiku-Verlag, Köln 2012. {{ISBN|3-865534-07-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Frye also aided James Polk in compiling ''Divisions on a Ground: Essays on Canadian Culture'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;For a critical discussion on Canadianness see: Marc A. Bauch: ''Canadian Self-Perception and Self-Representation in English-Canadian Drama after 1967.'' Wiku-Verlag, Köln 2012. {{ISBN|3-865534-07-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the posthumous ''Collected Works of Northrop Frye'', his writings on Canada occupy the thick 12th volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Based on his observations of Canadian literature, Frye concluded that, by extension, [[Canadian identity]] was defined by a fear of nature, by the history of settlement and by unquestioned adherence to the community. However, Frye perceived the ability and advisability of Canadian (literary) identity to move beyond these characteristics. Frye proposed the possibility of movement beyond the literary constraints of the garrison mentality: growing urbanization, interpreted as greater control over the environment, would produce a society with sufficient confidence for its writers to compose more formally advanced detached literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Open-source software development''' is the process by which [[Open-source software movement|open-source software]], or similar software whose [[Source Code Management|source code]] is publicly available, is developed by an '''open-source software project'''. These are software products available with its source code under an [[open-source license]] to study, change, and improve its design. Examples of some popular open-source software products are [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Chromium (web browser)|Google Chromium]], '''[[Android version history|Android]]''', [[LibreOffice]] and the [[VLC media player]]. Open-source software development has been a large part of the creation of the World Wide Web as we know it, with [[Tim Berners-Lee]] contributing his HTML code development as the original platform upon which the internet is now built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2014/03/web-at-25/tim-berners-lee|title=Tim Berners-Lee on the Web at 25: the past, present and future|work=Wired UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Distinguish|History of free and open-source software}}

In 1997, [[Eric S. Raymond]] wrote ''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''.{{Ref|Raymond}} In this book, Raymond makes the distinction between two kinds of software development. The first is the conventional closed-source development. This kind of development method is, according to Raymond, like the building of a cathedral; central planning, tight organization and one process from start to finish. The second is the progressive open-source development, which is more like "a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly emerge only by a succession of miracles." The latter analogy points to the discussion involved in an open-source development process.

Differences between the two styles of development, according to Bar and Fogel, are in general the handling (and creation) of bug reports and feature requests, and the constraints under which the programmers are working.{{Ref|Barfogel}} In closed-source software development, the programmers are often spending a lot of time dealing with and creating bug reports, as well as handling feature requests. This time is spent on creating and prioritizing further development plans. This leads to part of the development team spending a lot of time on these issues, and not on the actual development. Also, in closed-source projects, the development teams must often work under management-related constraints (such as deadlines, budgets, etc.) that interfere with technical issues of the software. In open-source software development, these issues are solved by integrating the users of the software in the development process, or even letting these users build the system themselves.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

== Model ==
{{distinguish|Open-source model}}
[[Image:OSSD process data diagram.png|thumb|250px|Process-Data Model for open-source software development]]

Open-source software development can be divided into several phases. The phases specified here are derived from ''Sharma et al''.{{Ref|Sharma}} A diagram displaying the process-data structure of open-source software development is shown on the right. In this picture, the phases of open-source software development are displayed, along with the corresponding data elements. This diagram is made using the [[meta-modeling]] and [[meta-process modeling]] techniques.

=== Starting an open-source project ===

There are several ways in which work on an open-source project can start:

# An individual who senses the need for a project announces the intent to develop a project in public.
# A developer working on a limited but working codebase, releases it to the public as the first version of an open-source program.
# The source code of a mature project is released to the public.
# A well-established open-source project can be [[Fork (software development)|forked]] by an interested outside party.

Eric Raymond observed in his essay ''The Cathedral and the Bazaar'' that announcing the intent for a project is usually inferior to releasing a working project to the public.

It's a common mistake to start a project when contributing to an existing similar project would be more effective ([[Not Invented Here#In the free software community|NIH syndrome]]). To start a successful project it is very important to investigate what's already there. The process starts with a choice between the adopting of an existing project, or the starting of a new project. If a new project is started, the process goes to the Initiation phase. If an existing project is adopted, the process goes directly to the Execution phase.

== Types of open-source projects ==
{{see also|List of open-source software packages}}

Several types of open-source projects exist. First, there is the garden variety of software programs and libraries, which consist of standalone pieces of code. Some might even be dependent on other open-source projects. These projects serve a specified purpose and fill a definite need. Examples of this type of project include the [[Linux kernel]], the Firefox web browser and the LibreOffice office suite of tools.

Distributions are another type of open-source project. Distributions are collections of software that are published from the same source with a common purpose. The most prominent example of a "distribution" is an operating system. There are many [[Linux]] distributions (such as [[Debian]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core]], [[Mandriva]], [[Slackware]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] etc.) which ship the Linux kernel along with many user-land components. There are other distributions, like [http://www.activestate.com/activeperl ActivePerl], the [[Perl|Perl programming language]] for various operating systems, and [[Cygwin]] distributions of open-source programs for [[Microsoft Windows]].

Other open-source projects, like the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] derivatives, maintain the source code of an entire operating system, the kernel and all of its core components, in one [[revision control]] system; developing the entire system together as a single team. These operating system development projects closely integrate their tools, more so than in the other distribution-based systems.

Finally, there is the book or standalone document project. These items usually do not ship as part of an open-source software package. The Linux Documentation Project hosts many such projects that document various aspects of the GNU/Linux operating system. There are many other examples of this type of open-source project.

== Methods ==

It is hard to run an open-source project following a more traditional software development method like the [[waterfall model]], because in these traditional methods it is not allowed to go back to a previous phase. In open-source software development, requirements are rarely gathered before the start of the project; instead they are based on early releases of the software product, as Robbins describes.{{Ref|Robbins}} Besides requirements, often volunteer staff is attracted to help develop the software product based on the early releases of the software. This networking effect is essential according to Abrahamsson et al.: “if the introduced prototype gathers enough attention, it will gradually start to attract more and more developers”. However, Abrahamsson et al. also point out that the community is very harsh, much like the business world of closed-source software: “if you find the customers you survive, but without customers you die”.{{Ref|Abrahamsson}}

Fuggetta{{Ref|Fuggetta}} argues that “rapid prototyping, incremental and evolutionary development, spiral lifecycle, rapid application development, and, recently, extreme programming and the agile software process can be equally applied to proprietary and open source software”. He also pinpoints [[Extreme Programming]] as an extremely useful method for open source software development. More generally, all [[Agile programming]] methods are applicable to open-source software development, because of their iterative and incremental character. Other Agile method are equally useful for both open and closed source software development:[[Internet-Speed Development]], for example is suitable for open-source software development because of the distributed development principle it adopts. Internet-Speed Development uses geographically distributed teams to ‘work around the clock’. This method, mostly adopted by large closed-source firms, (because they're the only ones which afford development centers in different time zones), works equally well in open source projects because a software developed by a large group of volunteers shall naturally tend to have developers spread across all time zones.

== Tools ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}

=== Communication channels ===

Developers and users of an open-source project are not all necessarily working on the project in proximity. They require some electronic means of communications. [[E-mail]] is one of the most common forms of communication among open-source developers and users. Often, [[electronic mailing list]]s are used to make sure e-mail messages are delivered to all interested parties at once. This ensures that at least one of the members can reply to it. In order to communicate in real time, many projects use an [[instant messaging]] method such as [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]. Web forums have recently become a common way for users to get help with problems they encounter when using an open-source product. [[Wiki]]s have become common as a communication medium for developers and users.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=== Version control systems ===
{{Main article|Revision control}}

In OSS development the participants, who are mostly volunteers, are distributed amongst different geographic regions so there is need for tools to aid participants to collaborate in the development of source code.

During early 2000s, [[Concurrent Versions System]] (CVS) was a prominent example of a source code collaboration tool being used in OSS projects. CVS helps manage the files and codes of a project when several people are working on the project at the same time. CVS allows several people to work on the same file at the same time. This is done by moving the file into the users’ directories and then merging the files when the users are done. CVS also enables one to easily retrieve a previous version of a file. During mid 2000s, [[Subversion (software)|The Subversion revision control system]] (SVN) was created to replace CVS. It is quickly gaining ground as an OSS project version control system.{{citation needed|date=January 2016|reason = Mobile fix}}

Many open-source projects are now using distributed revision control systems, which scale better than centralized repositories such as SVN and CVS.  Popular examples are [[Git (software)|git]], used by the [[Linux kernel]], and [[Mercurial]], used by the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=== Bug trackers and task lists ===
{{Main article|Bug tracking system}}

Most large-scale projects require a bug tracking system to keep track of the status of various issues in the development of the project. Some bug trackers include:

* [[Bugzilla]] – a sophisticated web-based bug tracker from [[Mozilla]].
* [[Mantis Bug Tracker]] – a web-based PHP/MySQL bug tracker.
* [[Trac]] – integrating a bug tracker with a wiki, and an interface to the Subversion version control system.
* [[Redmine]] – written in Ruby, integrates issue tracking, wiki, forum, news, roadmap, gantt project planning and interfaces with LDAP user directory.
* [[Request tracker]] – written in Perl. Given as a default to [[CPAN]] modules – see rt.cpan.org.
* [[SourceForge]] and its forks provide a bug tracker as part of its services. As a result, many projects hosted at SourceForge.net and similar services default to using it.
* [[Jira (software)|JIRA]] – Atlassian's project management and issue tracking tool.

=== Testing and debugging tools ===

Since OSS projects undergo frequent integration, tools that help automate testing during system integration are used. An example of such tool is Tinderbox. Tinderbox enables participants in an OSS project to detect errors during system integration. Tinderbox runs a continuous build process and informs users about the parts of source code that have issues and on which platform(s) these issues arise.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

A [[debugger]] is a computer program that is used to debug (and sometimes test or optimize) other programs. [[GNU Debugger]] (GDB) is an example of a debugger used in open-source software development. This debugger offers remote debugging, what makes it especially applicable to open-source software development.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

A memory leak tool or [[memory debugger]] is a programming tool for finding [[memory leaks]] and [[buffer overflows]]. A memory leak is a particular kind of unnecessary memory consumption by a computer program, where the program fails to release memory that is no longer needed. Examples of memory leak detection tools used by Mozilla are the [[XPCOM]] Memory Leak tools.
Validation tools are used to check if pieces of code conform to the specified syntax. An example of a validation tool is [[Splint (programming tool)|Splint]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=== Package management ===

A [[package management system]] is a collection of tools to automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages from a computer. The [[RPM Package Manager|Red Hat Package Manager]] (RPM) for .rpm and [[Advanced Packaging Tool]] (APT) for [[deb (file format)|.deb]] file format, are package management systems used by a number of Linux distributions.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

'''Arutprakasa Vallalār Chidambaram Ramalingam'''  (5 October 1823 – 30 January 1874), whose pre-monastic name was '''Rāmalingam''', commonly known in India and across the world&lt;ref&gt;friend Henry [http://www.istitutocintamani.org/englishSession/Theosophy_Timeless_Wisdom.pdf The Light Bearer. Theosophy, Timeless Wisdom speech by Stefano Martorano]&lt;/ref&gt; as '''Vallalār''', also known as '''Ramalinga Swamigal''' and '''Ramalinga Adigal''', was one of the most famous [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Hindu]] Saints and also one of the greatest Tamil poets of the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiapost.gov.in/Stamps2007.html commemorative postage stamp on  Vallalār] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wSKvdilj?url=http://www.indiapost.gov.in/Stamps2007.html |date=2011-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and belongs to a line of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[saints]] known as "[[Siddhar|gnana siddhars]]" (gnana means higher [[wisdom]]).

The ''Samarasa Suddha Sanmarga Sathiya Sangam''&lt;ref name="ambalamyoga.org"&gt;[http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalār%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf Details on ''Samarasa Suddha Sanmarga Sathiya Sangam'' ]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was spread and passed on by him not only in [[theory]] but mainly in practice by his own way of living which by itself is an inspiration for his followers. Through the notion of ''Suddha Sanmarga Sangam'', the saint endeavored to eliminate the [[Caste system in India|caste system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/br/2008/05/20/stories/2008052050851302.htm Book Review by "The Hindu" on Vallalār Rāmalinga adigal varalaru]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Suddha Sanmarga, the prime aspects of human life should be love connected with [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and [[divinity|divine]] practice leading to achievement of pure [[knowledge]].

Ramalinga advocated the concept of worshipping the flame of a lighted lamp as a symbol of the eternal Power.&lt;ref&gt;Alayam: The Hindu Temple; An Epitome of Hindu Culture; G.VenkataRamana Reddy; Published by Adhyaksha; Sri Rāmakrishna Math; {{ISBN|978-81-7823-542-4}}; Page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rāmalingam's parents were Rāmayyā pillai and Chinnammai. She was his sixth wife, as all his previous wives had died childless and in quick succession. They were a Karuneegar family in Marudhur, a village in the old  [[South Arcot|South Arcot district]], near [[Chidambaram]].  Rāmalingam was their fifth child. The older ones were two sons Sabhapati and Parasu Rāman; and two daughters, Sundarammal and Unnamulai. They named their youngest child Rāmalingam.

===Childhood and divine experiences===
Once, Rāmalingam's parents went to the [[Chidambaram Temple|Chidambaram Natarājar Temple]] with their five month old child, and the infant was joyous while the [[priest]]  was offering  [[Archana (Hinduism)|Deepa aradhana]] (adoration by lighted lamp being brought close to the vigrahams); this was perceived by Rāmalingam as a deep spiritual experience. In later years he said of the experience:

:"No sooner the Light was perceived, happiness prevailed on me", and

:"The sweet nectar was tasted by me as soon as the Arut perun jothi (Supreme Grace Of Light) became visible".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf Arutperunjothi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916051722/http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf |date=2008-09-16 }}, Tamil Nadu Text books online&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1824, his father Rāmayyā pillai died. Because of his untimely demise, Chinnammai shifted her residence to her mother's place at Chinna kāvanam. Saint Rāmalingam (1823 – 1874) was  a small child when he relocated with his mother to Chennai in 1826. He and his mother lived  with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife Pāppāthi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street, Sevenwells, [[Chennai]]-600001, which is in the area near [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha swāmi temple.]] After Rāmalingam reached five years of age, Sabhapati initiated his [[formal education]]. But the young child was not interested in that, instead he preferred trips to the nearby Kandha swāmi temple. Sabhapati thought that the child needed punishment as a form of discipline, and  he told his wife not to  give Rāmalingam his daily meal. His kind sister-in-law, however, secretly gave him food and persuaded him to study seriously at home. In return, Rāmalingam asked  for his own room, lighted lamp and mirror.  He placed the light in front of the mirror. He started [[meditation]] by concentrating on the light and thus began the young boy's spiritual life. He miraculously saw a vision of the [[Murugan|Lord Muruga]]. Rāmalingam said:

:"The beauty endowed divine faces six, the illustrious shoulders twelve."&lt;ref&gt;Lakshmi Devnath, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm "Compassion is the essence of Saint Rāmalingam's philosophy"], ''The Hindu'', February 2, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, Rāmalingam had to replace his elder brother Sabhapati at an [[Katha (storytelling format)|upanyāsam]] (religious stories) session as upāsakar. His great discourse on verses from the `[[Periya Puranam|Periya purānam]]', an epic poem by [[Sekkizhar]] about the saintly '63 [[Nayanars|Nāyanārs]]', was appreciated by the devotees as being given by a very learned scholar. Rāmalingam's mental and spiritual growth progressed rapidly. Rāmalingam says thanks to the [[divinity|Divine]] by:

:"Effulgent flame of grace, that lit in me intelligence, to know untaught."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Vallalar.org/WebComponents/FrontPage.aspx?ViewName=enBlogs&amp;WebSiteId=1&amp;ConId=294 Early life of Saint Vallalār]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rāmalingam evolved in his spiritual journey from being a devout devotee of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] to worshipping the formless.

Rāmalingam renounced the world at the young age of thirteen. But he was forced to marry his niece (on his sister's side). Legends say that the [[bridegroom]] during his first night after marriage was reading devotional works like the [[Tiruvasakam|Thiru vāsagam]]. He was not interested in money, and it is said that in later life he reduced or ignored eating and sleeping. But he seemed fit in body, which was possibly due to his supposed physical transformation.

==Teachings==
[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Heaps of grain bags at [[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya gnana sabha, Vadalur]] - established by Rāmalinga adigal ]]
At the age of 35 he left Chennai during the year 1858. First he went to [[Chidambaram]] where he had a debate with Kodakanallur Sundara Swāmigal. At the request of one Rāmakrishna Reddiyar he went to his house at [[Karunguzhi]] and stayed there for 9 years. He was very much against the [[caste|caste system]] because of the adverse impacts it had on society. Towards that end, he started the "Samarasa  Vedha Sanmarga Sangam" in 1865. In 1872 it was renamed "Samarasa Suddha Sanmarga Sathya Sangam",&lt;ref name="ambalamyoga.org" /&gt; meaning "Society for pure truth in universal self-hood".

In 1867, he established a  facility serving free food named "The Sathya Dharma Salai"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Vallalarspace.com/VallalarGroups/ Image of Sathya Dharma Salai]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Vadalur]]. There all people are served free food without any caste distinctions. The land for the facility was donated by kind, generous people and those registered documents are available for seeing by the visitors. The free facility continues its service till the present time. Rāmalinga disliked people eating [[non-vegetarian]] foods, about which he said:&lt;blockquote&gt;When I see men feeding on the coarse and vicious food of meat, it is an ever-recurring grief to me.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm "The Hindu" article on Vallalār]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Entrance to the Sathya Gnana Sabha. The sign above it reads "only those who have renounced meat and murder should enter"]]
On January 25th of 1872, Rāmalingam opened the "[[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya Gnana Sabha]]" (Hall of True Knowledge) at [[Vadalur]]. One of the primary teachings of Valallar is "[[community service|Service]] to [[Human beings|Living Beings]] is the path of [[Moksha|Liberation/ Moksha]]". He declared that death is not natural that our life's first priority should be to fight death. He declared religion in itself a darkness. He laid a very great emphasis on being vegetarian. He said God is "Arul Perum Jothi" who is personification of Grace or mercy and knowledge. He said the path of compassion and mercy are the only path to God.

In 1867 he established a center for feeding the poor people. On the inaugural day he lit the fire of the stone stove, with a declaration that the fire be ever alive and the needy shall be fed forever. Around 1872 he established the "Sathya Gnana Sabai", hall of True Wisdom Forum and ensuring it was entirely secular. This place is not a [[temple]]; fruits, flowers are not offered, and no blessings were given. It was open to people of all castes except those who ate meat, who were only allowed to worship from the outside. He wrote in detail about the ''pooja'' to be performed in Gnāna sabai. Those who are below 12 years or those who are above 72 years alone were expected to enter Gnāna sabai and do ''poojas''. The oil lamp lit by him is kept perpetually burning. He said that [[soul]]s are blinded by seven veils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf Details about the seven veils described by Vallalār] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There are seven cotton fabric screens, representing the seven factors that prevent a soul from realizing its true nature. The entire complex is bound by a chain with 21,600 links, said to represent ''21,600 inhalations''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religiousworlds.com/mandalam/janarnav.htm "Jnanarnava Tantra," Chapter Twenty One] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408093158/http://www.religiousworlds.com/mandalam/janarnav.htm |date=2006-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by a normal human being. He said the intelligence we possess is [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] intelligence which is not true and final intelligence. The path of final intelligence is ''Jeeva Karunyam''. He advocated a [[Caste in India|casteless society]]. Vallalār was opposed to [[superstition]]s and rituals. He forbade killing animals for the sake of food. He advocated feeding the poor as the highest form of worship. He condemned inequality based on birth. Today there are spiritual groups spread out all over the world who practice the teachings of Rāmalingam and follow the path of Arul Perum Jothi.

== Chennai Kandha kottam ==
[[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Kandha kottam Kandaswāmi Temple]]&lt;ref&gt;Official website Kandha kottam temple [http://kandhakottam.tnhrce.in/contact.html kandhakottam.tnhrce.in],  [http://www.kaumaram.com/ālayam/kandha_kottam/index.php Chennai Kandha kottam at Kaumaram.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is located in the [[George Town, Chennai|Parry's Corner (Old: George Town)]] neighbourhood of [[Chennai]] city in Tamil Nadu, India. Rāmalingam and his mother lived with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife Pāppāthi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street, Sevenwells, [[Chennai]]-600001, which is in the area near [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha swāmi temple.]] He spent a lot of his time at this temple. Rāmalingam composed 'Deiva mani malai' here. At this temple, there is a hall called the [[Mandapa|Mukha mandapam]], where the idols of [[Ganesha|Sarva Siddhi Vinayakar]], [[Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple|Meenakshi Sundareswarar]], Idumban, Sri Rāmalinga swāmigal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://temple.dinamalar.com/en/New_en.php?id=12 Dinamalar newspaper- Kandha kottam photos]&lt;/ref&gt; and Pamban swāmigal are found. The locality where he lived, has been renamed as '[[Vallalar Nagar|Vallalār nagar]]'.

==Literary works==
As a musician and poet, he composed 5818 poems teaching universal love and peace, compiled into 'Six Thiru Muraigal', which are all available today as a single book called Thiruvarutpa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tn.gov.in/tnpsc/FINEARTSde.html Tamil Nadu Public service commission included Thiru arut pa in syllabus]&lt;/ref&gt; (tiru-arut-pa, holy book of grace).

Another work of his is the Manumurai Kanda Vāsagam&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf Manumurai Kanda Vāsagam ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the life of [[Manu Needhi Cholan]].

Jeeva Karunya Ozhukkam&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambalamyoga.org/Jeiva%20Karunai.pdf Details on Jeeva Karunya Ozhukkam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725002210/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/Jeiva%20Karunai.pdf |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Songs set to music===
* Thiruvarutpa songs of Rāmalinga swāmigal are sung in concerts and now at least 25 songs (in Thiru varut pā Isai Mālai) are given with swara-tāla notation.
* ''Thāyāgi thandhaiyumai'' ([[Hamsadhwani]]), ''Idu nalla tharunam'' ([[Dheerasankarabharanam|Shankarābharanam]])
* ''Varuvar azhaithu vadi'' (Begada) and ''Thaen ena inikkum''.

Some of his songs were set to music by [[Sirkazhi Govindarajan|Sīrkāzhi Govindharājan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2004/11/05/stories/2004110503330900.htm Sirkazhi Govindarajan] from "The Hindu" newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supposed physical transformation==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Perhaps one of the most notable factors of this sage is the claim that he supposedly attained a divinization of the physical body. He attained a total of 3 transformations (i.e. transformations into Pure Body, Pranava (Sound) Body, and Gnostic Body). His first transformation was the transformation of his normal human body into the Perfect Body. The supposed attributes of this body are total invulnerability to everything thus rendering him effectively immortal and impervious to any kind of damage as well as having the attributes of being omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, this body is apparently made of Divine Light.

Beyond this state there was a subsequent transformation by which the Perfect Body transformed further into the Grace Body possessing the following attributes: This body has automatically a young appearance like that of a child, can be seen but can't be touched, and has complete and absolute dominion over all the [[Siddhis]].

Even beyond the State of the Grace Body supposedly there was a third and final transformation in which the Grace Body was transformed into the Bliss Body. This body is the body of the Supreme Godhead and is automatically omnipresent but can't be perceived by anyone.

By achieving this Rāmalingam demonstrated that the ultimate states of spirituality can in fact be attained in this world with the physical body and death is not a necessity to experience the ultimate spiritual experience.

==Disappearance==
On October 22, 1873, Rāmalingam raised the ''flag of Brotherhood''{{what|date=October 2018}} on his one-room residence ''Siddhi Valāgam'' in Mettukuppam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm Article in "The Hindu" narration on Siddhi Valakam]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his final and most popular lecture, about spiritual progress and, "nature of the powers that lie beyond us and move us," and recommended meditation using the lighted lamp from his room, which he then kept outside.

On January 30, 1874, Rāmalingam entered the room, locked himself inside and told his followers not to open it. After opening, he said, he will not be found there. (He will be," United with Nature &amp; ruling the actions of 'all of the alls'. " - as told in his poem called 'Gnana Sariyai'). His seclusion spurred many rumors, and the Government finally forced the doors open in May. The room was empty, with no clues. In 1906, records about his disappearance&lt;ref&gt;[http://bp3.blogger.com/_ye_-S-DaxNE/R_RyHb_UkJI/AAAAAAAAAqs/98zB2rqpjDI/s1600-h/gazette+1.jpg The image of engraved stone in Vadalur] about the Madras District Gazette's note describing the Rāmalingam's disappearance incident, that took place on January 30, 1874&lt;/ref&gt; were published in the South Arcot District's 'The Madras District [[Gazette]]er'.

==Postage stamp==
The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu released postage stamps depicting Rāmalingam on 17 August 2007. After that writ petition was submitted against the portrayal of Rāmalingam with ‘Thiru neeru’ (sacred ash) on his forehead. But the Madras High Court has declined to entertain that writ petition.&lt;ref&gt;"The Hindu" article about Rāmalingam stamp's [http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/06/stories/2007100653631000.htm  writ petition rejected by court]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1140">The term '''Realphilosophie''' was first introduced by [[Hegel]] &lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: Jenaer Realphilosophie. Lecture manuscripts for the philosophy of the nature and the spirit 1805-1806 (Vorlesungsmanuskripte zur Philosophie der Natur und des Geistes von 1805-1806). Akademie, Berlin 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; His Jenaer Realphilosophie of 1805/6 contains lectures "on the philosophy of nature and of the spirit". Hegel confronts the material philosophy of pure logic: Realphilosophie (Material philosophy) is thus thinking on [[empirical method|empirical basis]]. In his Realphilosophie, Hegel concerns himself, among other things, with phenomena found in [[astronomy]] and [[biology]]. However, Realphilosophie also includes social and cultural phenomena. It covers both [[natural philosophy]] and [[cultural philosophy]]. According to the German science journalist Gábor Paál the concept is congruent with the idea of the Third Culture.&lt;ref&gt;Are the disciplinaries permeable?

==Tantra massage==
The massage includes various techniques from different schools of [[massage]] with elements from [[yoga]], [[bioenergetics]], and  [[sexual therapy]].&lt;ref name=tma/&gt; According to the [[Tantric Massage Association]], it was developed in the 1980s by Andro Andreas Rothe, founder of Diamond Lotus Tantra Lounge, the first [[Tantra]] institute in Germany (1977).&lt;ref name=tma&gt;[http://www.tantramassage-verband.de/en/tantramassage.html Tantric Massage Association: The Massage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121144125/http://www.tantramassage-verband.de/en/tantramassage.html |date=2006-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The client or the receiver of a tantra massage is not a giver. Their duty is to receive the massage and surrender to the rediscovery of senses feelings and emotions.  The process combines the feeling of well-being associated with deep relaxation  therapeutic as people come to resolve issues related to relationship issues, self esteem issues including sexual issues.&lt;ref name=tma/&gt;&lt;ref name="vice_Ichw"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Ich war bei einer Tantra-Massage und habe Sexualität abseits von Klischees kennengelernt| author = von Nadja Brenneisen| work = Vice| date = 2015-09-09| accessdate = 2015-11-20| url = https://www.vice.com/de/read/in-zuerich-bei-der-tantra-massage-184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to the Tantric Massage Association Berlin, tantra massage is based on ideas taken from the work of [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Alexander Lowen]]. Other sources of inspiration included the work of [[Mantak Chia]], Joseph Kramer &amp;ndash; who developed the "[[lingam]] massage" &amp;ndash; and [[Annie Sprinkle]], who developed the "[[yoni]] massage".&lt;ref name=tma/&gt; Andro Rothé developed Tantra Massage, Tantra Erotic Massage and the less known Yin Yang Massage.   According to the published information on their website, tantric massage does allow any kind of sexual exchange between the massagist and the recipient of the massage.

The Tantric Massage Association represents members in Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref name=tmaa&gt;[http://www.tantramassage-verband.de/en/massage-institute.html Tantric Massage Association: Members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215044237/http://www.tantramassage-verband.de/en/massage-institute.html |date=2006-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; German courts have made tantra massage teaching taxable. Germany has recently outlawed the term "erotic massage" for tantric massage as the term has been allocated to [[sex workers]] only.&lt;ref name="thel_Cour"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Court mulls sex tax for tantra massage| work = thelocal.de| date = 2014-07-03| accessdate = 2015-11-20| url = http://www.thelocal.de/20140703/german-court-tantra-massage-sex-tax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Wanderground''''' is a [[speculative fiction]] novel by [[Sally Miller Gearhart]], published in 1979 by [[Persephone Press]]. It is Gearhart's first and most famous novel, and continues to be used in [[Women's Studies]] classes as a characteristic example of the [[lesbian separatist|separatist feminism]] movement from the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Lesbian Writers of the United State"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandra Pollack|first=Denise Knight|title=Contemporary Lesbian Writers of the United States|year=1993|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-313-28215-3|pages=207–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Wanderground is a collection of short, interlocking narratives &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kester-Shelton|first=Pamela|title=Sally Miller Gearhart|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=LitRC&amp;userGroupName=euge94201&amp;tabID=T002&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CK2410000104&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7CK2410000104&amp;docType=GALE&amp;role=LitRC|work=Feminist Writers|publisher=St. James Press|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that build on each other to form a full novel. Chapters fit together loosely, often focusing on completely different characters in each chapter, or taking place in a different part of the world Gearhart created, although many characters make reappearances throughout the collection, as the stories begin to build on each other. Many of the chapters were first published as short stories, in [[fanzines]], magazines, and [[lesbian periodicals]] including ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'', ''[[The Witch and the Chameleon]]'', ''Quest: A Feminist Quarterly'', and ''WomanSpirit''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gearhart|first=Sally|title=The Wanderground|year=1980|publisher=Persephone Press|location=Boston, Mass|isbn=978-0-932870-55-1|page=Copyright page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The Wanderground is set in the United States, in the future, although no date is given. The stories focus on the hill women, a group of women who have fled from the men-ruled cities to the wilderness, where they live in all-women communities in harmony with each other and the natural world. The hill women have [[psychic]] powers that they use to communicate with each other and with animals, and to move through the world. The main narrative that weaves throughout almost all of the stories, is caused by some kind of shift in the cosmic balance between the hill women and the cities. Rumors are whispered, things are getting worse for women in the cities. As the stories build on each other, subtle remarks are made about how things are getting worse, the cities are becoming even more controlling, it is more dangerous for the women underground, men are appearing outside of the cities, even to the point of rapes occurring in the borderlands. Something is changing. The tension finally comes to the foreground when the gentles (gay men, who have the greatest respect for all women, especially the hill women) request a meeting with the hill women. The message is smuggled out of the city, and a great discussion begins. Even though the gentles are considered to be allies of the hill women, they are still men, and this mixed status of ally and enemy causes a great debate.

==Characters==
As The Wanderground functions as a series of short stories in different parts of a world, the characters are listed here in association with the setting in which they appear.
*Western Ensconcement, a community of women: Seja, Clana, Zephyr, Voki, Artilidea
*Eastern Ensconcement,a community of women: Jaqua, Troja, Pelagine,
*Kochlias, noted for being the home of the 'Remember Rooms': Fora, Manaje, Li, Clana
*Borderlands, the edge of the hill women's territory: Alaka, Ono, Egathese, Blase
*Dangerland, between the land of the hill women and the city: Pony, Krueva, Ijeme, Ursula
*Earlytown, an abandoned town just outside the city: The Gentles, Evona, Chthona, Tulu
*The City: Betha, Ijeme, Evona

==Themes==

===Gender===
Gender is a source of tension throughout the novel. Among the basic tenets of the relationship between the communities of hill women to men is "It is not in his nature not to rape. It is not in my nature to be raped. We do not co-exist." (page 25). Gearhart said in an interview with ''[[off our backs]]'' that figuring out how those dynamics play out, the question of "what is the hill women's relationship to the men" is one of the main questions of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sturgis|first=Susanna|title=Discovering the Wanderground: An Interview with Sally Gearhart|journal=Off Our Backs|date=January 1980|volume=10|issue=1|pages=24–25, 27|jstor=25793272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmentalism===
This book is also linked by scholars with the idea of [[ecofeminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lavin|first=Sophie|title=Otto,&amp;nbsp;Eric C.&amp;nbsp;Green&amp;nbsp;Speculations:&amp;nbsp;Science&amp;nbsp;Fiction&amp;nbsp;and Transformative&amp;nbsp;Environmentalism. Columbus: Ohio State&amp;nbsp;University Press, 2012.|journal=The Journal of Ecocriticism|date=July 2012|volume=5|issue=2|pages=1–3|url=http://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/joe/article/viewFile/523/459|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas it presents of women living as one with the greater natural world, of being able to control one's [[fertility]], and of the communication with other non-human living beings, as well as the poetic style of prose Gearhart writes in are of particular interest to readers coming from an environmental background.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Lesbian Writers of the United State" /&gt;

It involves, after having exhaled all the air out, pulling the abdomen under the rib cage by taking a false inhale while holding the breath and then release the abdomen after a pause. The process is repeated many times before letting the air into the lungs, resuming normal breath.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

'''Walter Peñaloza''' (1920–2005) was a [[Peru]]vian philosopher and educator recognised for his contribution to the professional training of Peruvian teachers. He studied at the former Anglo-Peruvian College in [[Lima]], today the [[Colegio San Andrés]] . Later, while working as a teacher on the same campus, he won the First "Gonzales Prada" Prize in 1944, granted by the Directorate of Artistic Education Cultural Extension to the best philosophy work.

==Career==
He was Rector of the [[National University of Education Enrique Guzmán y Valle|National University of Education (La Cantuta)]] and a professor at other universities in Peru and Venezuela (Zulia State, Maracaibo). He inspired the development of the "Integral Curriculum", a curricular model that promotes a formation in values, and a greater contact between the university and the professional workplace.

His major contributions to Peruvian education were in the reform in university education. These include:
* The semesterisation of courses
* Unification of teacher training for initial, primary and secondary schools.
* Promotion of the system of university credit to enable a greater comparability between the curricula of different universities. This system is still used in Peruvian universities.
* Intensification of pre-professional practice.
* In 2004, he received a distinction from the [[University Garcilaso]] for having urged the universal provision of early childhood education to the Education Reform body of the [[Juan Velasco Alvarado|Velasco]] government.
In 1975 he was appointed Director of the (now discontinued) newspaper "La Prensa". One of his important actions was the publication of the children's magazine "Urpi", where he put into practice his proposal for the formation of values. This magazine was considered revolutionary at the time, especially in the popular sector; its reception was such that initial publication runs sold-out. Its editor Gladys Pradó, brought together many of the best of artists and intellectuals in the Peruvian children's field, leading "Urpi" to become recognised among the three most important children's magazines in Latin American history.

He was made an outstanding member of the Order of the ''[[Palmas Magisteriales]]''—a distinction granted by the Peruvian State through the Ministry of Education to recognise teachers or intellectuals, who have contributed to the progress of education, science, culture and technology in Peru.
