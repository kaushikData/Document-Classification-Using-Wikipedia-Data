In [[futures studies]] and the [[history of technology]], '''accelerating change''' is a perceived increase in the rate of [[technological change]] throughout history, which may suggest faster and more profound change in the future and may or may not be accompanied by equally profound social and cultural change&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Being surprised and surprising ourselves: a geography of personal and social change. Progress in Human Geography, OnlineFirst, pp. 1-20, https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132518810431 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, M., 2018. On the future: prospects for humanity. Princeton: Princeton University Press &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Early observations ==
In 1910 during the town planning conference of London [[Daniel Burnham]] noted that "But it is not merely in the number of facts or sorts of knowledge that progress lies: it is still more in the geometric ratio of sophistication, in the [[geometric growth|geometric widening]] of the sphere of knowledge, which every year is taking in a larger percentage of people as time goes on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions00town|title=Transactions|first1=England)|last1=Town Planning Conference (1910 : London|last2=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=8 July 2018|publisher=London : Royal Institute of British Architects|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later on  "It is the argument with which I began, that a mighty change having come about in fifty years, and our pace of development having immensely accelerated, our sons and grandsons are going to demand and get results that would stagger us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions00town|title=Transactions|first1=England)|last1=Town Planning Conference (1910 : London|last2=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=8 July 2018|publisher=London : Royal Institute of British Architects|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[Buckminster Fuller]] introduced the word [[ephemeralization]] to describe the trends of "doing more with less" in chemistry, health and other areas of [[industrial development]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Nine Chains to the Moon]]'', [[Southern Illinois University Press]] [1938] 1963 pp.&amp;nbsp;276–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946, Fuller published a chart of the discoveries of the chemical elements over time to highlight the development of accelerating acceleration in human knowledge acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Synergetics (Fuller)]]'', http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s04/figs/f1903.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Stanislaw Ulam]] wrote in reference to a conversation with [[John von Neumann]]: {{quote|One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.&lt;ref name="mathematical"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-5-JeCa2Z7hbWcxTGsyU09HSTg/edit?pli=1 | last=Ulam|first=Stanislaw |title=Tribute to John von Neumann|publisher=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume= 64, nr 3, part 2|date=May 1958|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Moravec's ''Mind Children''==
In a series of published articles from 1974–1979, and then in his 1988 book ''Mind Children'', computer scientist and futurist [[Hans Moravec]] generalizes [[Moore's law]] to make predictions about the future of artificial life. Moore's law describes an [[exponential growth]] pattern in the complexity of integrated semiconductor circuits. Moravec extends this to include technologies from long before the integrated circuit to future forms of technology. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm| journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology| date=1998| volume=1| title=When will computer hardware match the human brain?| first=Hans| last=Moravec| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm| archivedate=15 June 2006| deadurl=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html| title= The Age of Robots|date=June 1993| first=Hans| last=Moravec| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060615055406/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html| archivedate= 15 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting around 2030–2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2004/Predictions.html| title=Robot Predictions Evolution| first=Hans| last=Moravec|date=April 2004| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060616045535/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2004/Predictions.html| archivedate= 16 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind'', published in 1998, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving [[robot intelligence]], generalizing [[Moore's Law]] to technologies predating the [[integrated circuit]], and also plotting the exponentially increasing computational power of the brains of animals in evolutionary history. Extrapolating these trends, he speculates about a coming "mind fire"  of rapidly expanding [[superintelligence]] similar to the [[intelligence explosion|explosion of intelligence]] predicted by Vinge.

== James Burke's ''Connections'' ==
{{Main|Connections (TV series)}}

In his TV series ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'' (1978)&amp;mdash;and sequels ''Connections²'' (1994) and ''Connections³'' (1997)&amp;mdash;[[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] explores an "Alternative View of Change" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and teleological view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire gestalt of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religious) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.

Burke also explores three corollaries to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events we weren't even aware of at the time.

The second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly change itself, becomes too much for the average person to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.

== Gerald Hawkins' ''Mindsteps'' ==

In his book "Mindsteps to the Cosmos" (HarperCollins, August 1983), [[Gerald Hawkins|Gerald S. Hawkins]] elucidated his notion of 'mindsteps', dramatic and irreversible changes to [[paradigms]] or world views. He identified five distinct mindsteps in human history, and the technology that accompanied these "new world views": the invention of imagery, writing, mathematics, printing, the telescope, rocket, radio, TV, computer... "Each one takes the collective mind closer to reality, one stage further along in its understanding of the relation of humans to the cosmos." He noted: "The waiting period between the mindsteps is getting shorter. One can't help noticing the acceleration." Hawkins' empirical 'mindstep equation' quantified this, and gave dates for future mindsteps. The date of the next mindstep (5; the series begins at 0) is given as 2021, with two further, successively closer mindsteps in 2045 and 2051, until the limit of the series in 2053. His speculations ventured beyond the technological:

{{quote|The mindsteps... appear to have certain things in common - a new and unfolding human perspective, related inventions in the area of memes and communications, and a long formulative waiting period before the next mindstep comes along. None of the mindsteps can be said to have been truly anticipated, and most were resisted at the early stages. In looking to the future we may equally be caught unawares. We may have to grapple with the presently inconceivable, with mind-stretching discoveries and concepts.}}

==Vinge's exponentially accelerating change==
The mathematician [[Vernor Vinge]] popularized his ideas about exponentially accelerating technological change in the science fiction novel ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'' (1986), set in a world of rapidly accelerating progress leading to the emergence of more and more sophisticated technologies separated by shorter and shorter time intervals, until a point beyond human comprehension is reached. His subsequent [[Hugo award]]-winning novel ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' (1992) starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of a [[superintelligence]] passing through exponentially accelerating developmental stages ending in a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], almost [[omnipotent]] power unfathomable by mere humans. His already mentioned influential 1993 paper on the [[technological singularity]] compactly summarizes the basic ideas.

==Kurzweil's ''The Law of Accelerating Returns''{{anchor|The Law of Accelerating Returns|Law of Accelerating Returns}}==

In his 1999 book ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', [[Ray Kurzweil]] proposed "The Law of Accelerating Returns", according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including but not limited to the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Kurzweil, ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'', Viking, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA630#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 30] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA632#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave further focus to this issue in a 2001 essay entitled "The Law of Accelerating Returns".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns ''The Law of Accelerating Returns'']. [[Ray Kurzweil]], March 7, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Kurzweil, after Moravec, argued for extending Moore's Law to describe [[exponential growth]] of diverse forms of [[technology|technological]] progress.  Whenever a technology approaches some kind of a barrier, according to Kurzweil, a new technology will be invented to allow us to cross that barrier. He cites numerous past examples of this to substantiate his assertions. He predicts that such [[paradigm shift]]s have and will continue to become increasingly common, leading to "technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history." He believes the Law of Accelerating Returns implies that a [[technological singularity]] will occur before the end of the 21st century, around 2045. The essay begins:

{{quote|An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense 'intuitive linear' view. So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century—it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today's rate). The 'returns,' such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness, also increase exponentially. There's even exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth. Within a few decades, machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to the Singularity—technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history. The implications include the merger of biological and nonbiological intelligence, immortal software-based humans, and ultra-high levels of intelligence that expand outward in the universe at the speed of light.}}

[[Image:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Moore's Law expanded to other technologies]]
[[File:Moore's_Law_over_120_Years.png|thumb|right|200px|An updated version of Moore's Law over 120 Years (based on [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil's]] [[c:File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|graph]]). The 7 most recent data points are all [[Nvidia GPUs|NVIDIA GPUs]].]]
The Law of Accelerating Returns has in many ways altered public perception of [[Moore's law]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It is a common (but mistaken) belief that Moore's law makes predictions regarding all forms of technology,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} when really it only concerns semiconductor circuits. Many [[futurist]]s still use the term "Moore's law" to describe ideas like those put forth by Moravec, Kurzweil and others.

According to Kurzweil, since the beginning of [[evolution]], more complex life forms have been evolving exponentially faster, with shorter and shorter intervals between the emergence of radically new life forms, such as human beings, who have the capacity to engineer (i.e. intentionally design with efficiency) a new trait which replaces relatively blind evolutionary mechanisms of selection for efficiency. By extension, the rate of technical progress amongst humans has also been exponentially increasing, as we discover more effective ways to do things, we also discover more effective ways to learn, i.e. [[language]], numbers, written language, [[philosophy]], [[scientific method]], instruments of observation, tallying devices, mechanical calculators, computers, each of these major advances in our ability to account for information occur increasingly close together. Already within the past sixty years, life in the industrialized world has changed almost beyond recognition except for living memories from the first half of the 20th century. This pattern will culminate in unimaginable technological progress in the 21st century, leading to a singularity. Kurzweil elaborates on his views in his books ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' and ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''.

==Criticisms==
Examples of large human "buy-ins" into technology include the [[computer revolution]], as well as massive government projects like the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[Human Genome Project]]. The foundation organizing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]] believes [[aging research]] could be the subject of such a massive project if substantial progress is made in slowing or reversing [[cellular aging]] in mice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Both [[Theodore Modis]] and Jonathan Huebner have argued—each from different perspectives—that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Korotayev A.

In fact, "[[technological singularity]]" is just one of a few singularities detected through the analysis of a number of characteristics of the [[World Systems Theory|World System]] development, for example, with respect to the [[world population]], world GDP, and some other economic indices.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Johansen, A., and D.

&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] pattern of the world demographic, economic, cultural, urbanistic, and technological growth (observed for many centuries, if not millennia prior to the 1970s) could be accounted for by a rather simple mechanism, the nonlinear second-order [[positive feedback]], that was shown long ago to generate precisely the [[hyperbolic growth]], known also as the "blow-up regime" (implying just [[finite-time singularities]]). In our case this nonlinear second order positive feedback looks as follows: more people – more potential inventors – faster technological growth – the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth grows faster – faster [[population growth]] – more people – more potential inventors  – faster technological growth, and so on. On the other hand, this research has shown that since the 1970s the World System  does not develop hyperbolically any more, its development diverges more and more from the blow-up regime, and at present it is moving "from singularity", rather than "toward singularity".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] calls the Singularity "[[Omega]]", referring to [[Teilhard de Chardin]]'s [[Omega Point]] (1916). For Omega = 2040, he says the series Omega - 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; human lifetimes (n &lt; 10; one lifetime = 80 years) roughly matches the most important events in [[human history]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12064">'''Adémar de Chabannes''' (sometimes ''Adhémar de Chabannes'') (c. 989{{ndash}}1034&lt;ref&gt;Landes ([[#Land95|1995, 77]]).&lt;/ref&gt;) was an eleventh-century French [[monk]], a historian, a musical [[composer]] and a successful [[forgery|literary forger]].

==Life==
Adémar was born at [[Chabannes]], a village in today's [[Haute-Vienne]] ''[[département in France|département]]'' of France. Educated at the [[Saint-Martial-de-Limoges|Abbey Saint-Martial de Limoges]], he passed his life as a monk, both there and at the monastery of [[Saint-Cybard]] at [[Angoulême]]. Adémar died around 1034, most probably at [[Jerusalem]], where he had gone on a [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Writings==
[[File:TonarAdemar.jpg|thumb|400px|The intonation formulas for the 8 tones according to the Aquitanian [[tonary]], which has been partly notated by Adémar ([[Bibliothèque Nationale|F-Pn]] lat. [[#Pbn909|909]], fol. 151r-154r)]]
When Adémar joined the Abbey [[Saint Martial of Limoges]], he was educated by his uncle Roger de Chabannes, [[Cantor (church)|cantor]] of the Abbey between 1010 until his death in 1025.&lt;ref&gt;James Grier ([[#Gri2006|2006]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Adémar learned calligraphy, to read, to compose and to notate liturgical chant, to compile and to revise liturgical books, and to compose and to write liturgical poetry, homilies, chronicles and hagiography.&lt;ref&gt;James Grier ([[#Gri1995|1995]]).&lt;/ref&gt; His life was mainly spent in writing and transcribing chant books and chronicles, and his principal work is a history entitled ''Chronicon Aquitanicum et Francicum'' or ''Historia Francorum''. This is in three books and deals with Frankish history from the reign of [[Pharamond]], king of the Franks, to 1028. The first two books are scarcely more than a copy of earlier histories of Frankish kings, such as the ''[[Liber Historiae Francorum]]'', the ''Continuation'' of [[Fredegar]] and the ''[[Annales regni Francorum]]''. The third book, which deals with the period from 814 to 1028, is of considerable historical importance.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Adhemar de Chabannes|volume=1|pages=191-192}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies partly on the ''[[Chronicon Aquitanicum]]'', to which Adémar himself added a final notice for the year 1028.

==Forgery==
He embraced the developing tale that [[Saint Martial]], the third century [[bishop]] who [[Christianized]] the [[Limoges]] district, had actually lived centuries earlier, and was in fact one of the original [[Twelve apostles|apostles]]. And he supplemented the less than scanty documentation for the alleged 'apostolicity' of Martial, first with a forged ''Life'' of Martial, as if composed by Martial's successor, [[Aurelian of Limoges|Bishop Aurelian]]. To effect this claim, he composed an "Apostolic Mass" that still exists in Adémar's own hand ([[Bibliothèque Nationale|F-Pn]] lat. [[#Pbn1121|1121]], ff. 28v-32v). The local [[bishop]] and [[abbot]] seem to have cooperated in the project and the [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] was first sung on Sunday, August 3, 1029.&lt;ref&gt;See James Grier's entry for "[[#GriNG|Adémar de Chabannes]]" in the New Grove Dictionary.&lt;!-- Here was a citation needed tag which I replaced. If the original author was more precisely about the secondary literature, it would be better (I inserted here Grier's book, he mentions it on pp. 55f and note 60 mainly quotes those publications by Saltet which he quoted in his Grove article). I am quite sure, that she or he has taken it from there, but it is not copied and pasted. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately for Adémar, the [[liturgy]] was disrupted by a travelling monk, [[Benedict of Chiusa]], who denounced the improved ''Vita'' of Martial as a provincial forgery and the new liturgy as offensive to God. The word spread, and the promising young monk was disgraced. Adémar's reaction was to build forgery upon forgery, inventing a Council of 1031 that confirmed the 'apostolic' status of Martial, even a forged papal letter. The reality of this pathological tissue of forgeries was only unravelled in the 1920s, by a historian, [[Louis Saltet]]. Mainstream Catholic historians ignored Saltet's revelations until the 1990s.&lt;!-- Does not sound like the famous "NPOV" and should anyway not be written in the main text. I recommend to quote here the opinion of a certain reviewer within a note "&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;" with a clear explanation who ignored Saltet or a quotation where a reviewer accused "mainstream catholic historians" to ignore Saltet's publications, or to omit otherwise the last phrase. --&gt; {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the long run, Adémar was successful. By the late 11th century, Martial was indeed venerated in Aquitaine as an apostle, though his legend was doubted elsewhere. In a very direct way, Adémar's Mass shows the power of liturgy to effect worship.

==Works and legacy==
[[File:Adémar de Chabannes.jpg|thumb|Drawing of [[Saint Cybard]] by Adémar]]
Adémar composed his musical Mass and office according to the [[Saint Martial school|local school]] of his uncle Roger who worked as a cantor between 1010 until his death in 1025 at [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|St. Martial Abbey]] using those modal patterns, as they have been documented in the [[Tonary|tonaries]] of the new troper-prosers ([[Bibliothèque Nationale|F-Pn]] lat. [[#Pbn1121|1121]], [[#Pbn909|909]]), chant books to which Adémar had partly contributed as a notator. Concerning the Apostolic feast of the patron he composed as well the hymns as the music which had become the metier of a cantor at Saint Martial. For this liturgical occasion which he had to create, he contributed like other cantors with own compositions, especially in the [[Trope (music)|tropes]] (extended musical items added to existing liturgical texts).

According to James Grier, Professor of Music History in the [[Don Wright Faculty of Music]] at the [[University of Western Ontario]], Adémar was the first person to write music using the musical notation still in use today. He placed the musical notes above the text, higher or lower according to the pitch. Professor Grier states that "Placement on the vertical axis remains the standard convention for indicating pitch in notation in Western culture and there is far greater weight on pitch than on many other elements such as dynamics and timbre". Therefore, in discovering this document written around 1000 years in the past, Professor Grier turns Adémar in one of the first—if not the first—to write music using "modern" notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Montgomery|first1=Marc|title=Canadian musicologist makes 900 year old discovery|url=http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2014/10/22/canadian-musicologist-make-900-year-old-discovery/|website=Radio Canada International|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1831 and 1872, over three thousand Africans were recruited from the [[Dutch Gold Coast]] for service as [[colonial troops]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. This recruitment was in fact an emergency measure, as the Dutch army lost thousands of European soldiers and a much larger number of "[[KNIL|native]]" soldiers in the [[Java War]] against [[Prince Diponegoro]].

== History ==
Following the [[Belgian Revolution|independence of Belgium]] in 1830, the Netherlands’ population was considerably diminished, making colonial combat losses more difficult to replace. Furthermore, the Dutch wanted the number of locally recruited soldiers in the East Indies Army to be limited to roughly half the total strength, to ensure the loyalty of native forces. It was also hoped that Akan soldiers would be more resistant to the tropical climate and tropical diseases of the [[Dutch East Indies]] than Dutch soldiers.

The soldiers from the Gold Coast were first recruited in [[Elmina]]. Of the 150 that were enlisted, 44 were descendants of Euro-African families in Elmina. They were deployed in 1832 in southern [[Sumatra]]. The West Africans proved less resistant to the climate than had been hoped, but their physique and general appearance as soldiers impressed the Sumatran population. In 1836 a further group of 88 Akan soldiers arrived in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch government then decided to recruit from the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] people.

In the autumn of 1836 Major General [[Jan Verveer]] undertook a mission to the King of Ashanti. On November 1, 1836, after he had arrived in Elmina, General Verveer departed with a retinue of about 900 people (the majority porters carrying provisions and gifts) to the capital of the Ashanti kingdom, [[Kumasi|Comassie (Kumasi)]]. After lengthy negotiations, an agreement was concluded with [[Kwaku Dua I Panyin|King Kwaku Dua]]. In Kumasi, a recruiting branch office was established by [[Jacob Huydecoper]], a Dutch government official from Elmina of mixed Dutch-African descent. Kwaku Dua also sent two princes, [[Kwasi Boakye|Kwasi Boachi]] and Kwame Poku Boachi, to Verveer in the Netherlands for training. Their subsequent careers are described by [[Arthur Japin]] in his novel ''[[The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi]]'' (1997).

Because the British had abolished [[slavery]], a somewhat cautious approach to recruitment was taken. The Ashanti king offered slaves and prisoners of war from the surrounding regions, for Dutch colonial service. However they nominally put themselves forward as voluntary recruits. As Dutch [[military service]] personnel they were entitled to receive pay. However British objections in 1842 led to discontinuation of this relatively successful recruitment. In 1855 enrollment resumed due to the positive experiences of West African soldiers in the Dutch East Indies.  This renewed recruitment was now on a strictly voluntary basis.

== End of African recruitment ==
A total of several thousand African soldiers "with a Dutch name", were shipped to the Dutch East Indies. The [[Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870-1871|Treaty of Sumatra in 1871]] gave the Netherlands possessions on the Gold Coast [[British West Africa|to the British]]. This terminated the recruitment of Africans for the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army. On April 20, 1872 the last ship with African recruits left for [[Java]]. There were however two further attempts to recruit black volunteers for the Colonial Army. Between 1876 and 1879 thirty [[African American|American black]] recruits were hired for the KNIL. In 1890 there was an attempt to obtain recruits from [[Liberia]]. A total of 189 Liberians went to Java, but this group became almost entirely dissatisfied with failed promises and returned to Liberia in 1892. Even without the recruitment of African soldiers, the KNIL still had soldiers of African origin in its army long after the 1890s. These African and [[Indo-African]] soldiers were the offspring of the Africans that the Dutch shipped from the [[Dutch Gold Coast]] between 1830 and 1872.&lt;ref name="Kessel"&gt;Kessel, Ineke van (Amsterdam 2005).

'''Bhagatrav''' ({{lang-sa|भगत्रव}}) is a minor archaeological site belonging to the [[Indus valley civilization]]. Excavated by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] led by Dr. [[S. R. Rao]], Bhagatrav is located in [[Hansot]] (51&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Surat]]) taluka of [[Bharuch district]] in south [[Gujarat]], near the coastline with the [[Arabian Sea]], and gives access to the [[agate]]-bearing mines and forested hills of the valleys of the rivers [[Narmada River|Narmada]] and [[Tapti River|Tapti]].&lt;ref name=asi&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Ghosh|editor-first=Amalanada|title=An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology|year=1990|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004092648|pages=73, 79, 90, 291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wba-EZhZcfgC&amp;dq=bhagatrav&amp;q=bhagatrav}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Port==
Bhagatrav seems to have been an important port, as [[Lothal]].&lt;ref name="ancient"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Director General|first=Archaeological Survey of India|date=|year=1962|title=Ancient India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=impDAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=bhagatrav&amp;dq=bhagatrav|journal=|volume=|issue=18–19|pages=190–197|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, backwaters of sea and floods from Kim river has washed out the site to a large extent and only peripheral area is left for exploration and for eight months in a year, the site is surrounded by water.&lt;ref name=ancient/&gt;

The number of lead pieces, many earth samples with rich iron contents, stone beads, evidences of production of glazed ware (pottery) are found. It may have been a trading port contemporary to Lothal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/city/ahmedabad/IIT-Gn-finds-rich-Harappan-remains-in-Bhagatrav/articleshow/48425306.cms|title=IIT-Gn finds rich Harappan remains in Bhagatrav - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
It is observed that flood was one of the reasons for decline/destruction of some Harappan settlements such as Bhagatrav, [[Lothal]], [[Rangpur, India|Rangpur]], [[Desalpur]], [[Chanhu-daro]] etc.&lt;ref name=ancient/&gt;

This is one of southernmost Harappan settlements and the distance between [[Manda, Jammu]] (one of northernmost Harappan settlement located in Jammu and Kashmir) and Bhagatrav is about 1350&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=asi/&gt;

[[File:1980 Summer Olympics bronze medal.JPG|thumb|A bronze medal from the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]]]
[[Image:National gallery in washington d.c., pisanello, medaglia di giovanni di bisanzio recto.JPG|thumb|The bronze commemorative [[Medal of the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos]] by [[Pisanello]] (1438), made in various metals, but usually in bronze]] 

A '''bronze medal''' in sports and other similar areas involving competition is a [[medal]] made of [[bronze]] awarded to the third-place finisher of contests or  competitions such as the [[Olympic Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]], etc. The outright winner receives a [[gold medal]] and the second place a [[silver medal]]. More generally, bronze is traditionally the most common metal used for all types of high-quality medals, including artistic ones.  The practice of awarding [[bronze]] third place [[medal]]s began at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympic Games]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], before which only first and second places were awarded.

==Olympic Games==
{{main|Olympic medal}}
[[Mint (coin)|Minting]] Olympic medals is the responsibility of the host city. From [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]]–[[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by [[Florence|Florentine]] artist [[Giuseppe Cassioli]] with text giving the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of an Olympic champion. From [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]–[[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], Cassioli's design (or a slight reworking) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli's design showed a Roman amphitheatre for what was originally a Greek game, a new obverse design was commissioned for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens 2004]] Games. [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] medals have been of more varied design.

In a few tournament sports, such as [[Boxing at the Summer Olympics|boxing]], [[Judo at the Summer Olympics|judo]], [[Taekwondo at the Summer Olympics|taekwondo]] and [[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|wrestling]], two bronze medals are awarded in each event – one for each eliminated semi-finalist or for the winners of the ''[[repechage]]'' brackets.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Psychological study==
In 1995, a study was carried out by [[social psychology|social psychologists]] Victoria Medvec, Scott Madey and [[Thomas Gilovich]] on the effects of [[counterfactual thinking]] on the Olympics. The study showed that athletes who won the bronze medal were significantly happier with their winning than those athletes who won the [[silver medal]]. The silver medalists were more frustrated because they had missed the [[gold medal]], while the bronze medalists were simply happy to have received any honors at all (instead of no medal for fourth place).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiskha.com/social_studies/psychology/almost_made_it.html Homework Help: Social Studies: Psychology: "I almost made it!"]&lt;/ref&gt;
This is more pronounced in [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout competitions]], where the bronze medals are achieved by [[third place playoff|winning a playoff]], whereas silver medals are awarded after a defeat in the final.
This psychological phenomenon was parodied in the [[Jerry Seinfeld]] special ''[[I'm Telling You for the Last Time]]''.

[[Image:Choctaw group.png|325px|thumb|Mississippi Choctaws in traditional clothing, ca. 1908]]
[[File:Choctaw Eagle Dance.jpg|thumb|325px|''Eagle Dance, Choctaw'', painted by [[George Catlin]] near [[Fort Gibson, Oklahoma]], 1835-7&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/luce/object.cfm?key=338&amp;artistmedia=0&amp;subkey=678 "Eagle Dance, Choctaw."] ''Luce Foundation for American Art.'' (retrieved 7 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Choctaw mythology''' is related to [[Choctaw]]s, a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe originally from the [[Southeastern United States]] ([[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Louisiana]]). In the 19th century, Choctaws were known as one of the "[[Five Civilized Tribes]]." Today the Choctaws have four tribes, the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]], [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]], [[Jena Band of Choctaw Indians]], and the [[MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians]].

The Choctaw and their ancestors have lived in the Mississippi region for about 4000 to 8000 years. Thousands of years of [[myth]] and story-making have contributed to a rich collection of history that spans the centuries. The Choctaw continue to tell and write about the legends that many have experienced in the American [[Deep South]].

==Choctaw creation==

===First version===

The Choctaw who remain in [[Mississippi]] tell this story as an explanation of how they came to the land where they live now and of how [[Nanih Waiya]] Mound came to be. These are real facts.

Two brothers, [[Choctaw|Chata]] and [[Chickasaw|Chicksah]] led the original people from a land in the far west that had ceased to prosper. The people traveled for a long time, guided by a [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Cosmology|magical pole]]. Each night, when the people stopped to camp, the pole was placed in the ground and in the morning the people would travel in the direction in which the pole leaned.

After traveling for an extremely long time, they finally came to a place where the pole remained upright. In this place, they laid to rest the bones of their ancestors, which they had carried in buffalo sacks from the original land in the west.

The [[Mound#North American archaeology|mound]] grew out of that great burial.

After the burial, the brothers discovered that the land could not support all the people. Chicksah took half the people and departed to the North and eventually became the [[Chickasaw]] tribe.

Chatah and the others remained near the mound and are now known as the [[Choctaw]].&lt;ref&gt;Taken from [http://www.indianlegend.com/choctaw/choctaw_001.htm Choctaw Creation Myth] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130126045548/http://www.indianlegend.com/choctaw/choctaw_001.htm |date=26 January 2013 }} where it is listed as being in the public domain&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second version===
At the beginning there was a great mound. It was called [[Nanih Waiya]]. It was from this mound that the creator fashioned the first of the people. These people crawled through a long, dark cave into daylight and became the first Choctaw.

==Supernatural Native America==
[[Image:MacoocheeMoundEffigyPipe.png|thumb|Effigy pipe from the Nacoochee Mound in Georgia, U.S.]]
Some early writers, and in later times Cushman and Bushnell, report that the Choctaws believed in a great good spirit and a great evil spirit. It seems that there were a number of supernatural beings mentioned in Choctaw historical accounts. In addition to the native language for what would today be termed God and Devil, the Choctaws believed they had many other "powerful beings" in their midst.

==={{anchor|Hushtahli}} Ancient religion===
The [[Great Spirit]] of the Choctaw went by various names. Rev. Alfred Wright also said The Great Spirit was referred to as "Nanapesa," "Ishtahullo-chito" or "Nanishta-hullo-chito," "Hushtahli," and "Uba P&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;ke" or "Aba."&lt;ref name=john_swanton&gt;{{Google books|hSy7fZR5bQgC|Source Material for the Social and Ceremonial Life of the Choctaw Indians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jobes, Gertrude. ''Dictionary of Mythology Folklore and Symbols''. New York:The Scarecrow Press, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shilup chitoh osh'' is a term anglicized to mean The Great Spirit. ''Chitokaka'' means The Great One. The terms ''lshtahullo'' or ''nanishtahullo'' is applied to anything thought to possess some occult or superior power - such as a witch.

{{quote|Anthropologist theorize that the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] ancestors of the Choctaw placed the sun at the center of their cosmological system. Mid-eighteenth-century Choctaws did view the sun as a being endowed with life. Choctaw diplomats, for example, spoke only on sunny days. If the day of a conference were cloudy or rainy, Choctaws delayed the meeting, usually on the pretext that they needed more time to discuss particulars, until the sun returned. The sun made sure that all talks were honest. The sun as a symbol of great power and reverence is a major component of southeastern Indian cultures.&lt;!--|20px|20px|--&gt;

''Hushtahli'' is from ''Hashi'' (sun) and ''Tahli'' (to complete an action). ''Hushtahli'' is believed to have originated as a Choctaw term without European influence; the Choctaw were believed to be sun worshipers. Fire was the "most striking representation of the sun", having intelligence, and was considered to be in constant communication with the sun.

===Little people and other human-like creatures===
They believed in a little man, about two feet high, who dwelled alone in the thick, dark woods. The little man was called ''Bohpoli'' or ''Kowi anukasha'', both names being used alone or together. The translation of ''Bohpoli'' is the "Thrower". The translation of ''Kowi anuskasha ''is "The one who stays in the woods", or to give a more concise translation, "Forest dweller". Little man can be compared to the European counterparts- [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]s, [[Elf|elves]], [[gnome]]s, and [[leprechaun]]s.

little grass known as (ole) to be rather mischievous, but not malicious. The Choctaws believed that they held sticks and stones in them. All unexplained sounds heard in the woods were attributed to (ole) or little grass, believing it took a special pleasure in hitting the pine trees to create noise.

Bohpoli was never seen by the common Choctaws, only the prophets and doctors. The Indian doctors would report that Bohpoli assisted them in the manufacture of their medicines. Some stories even give the account that bohpoli would "steal" little children and take them into the woods, to teach them about herbs and medicines. After returning the children to their homes, Bohpoli would leave them alone, letting them grow up to become doctors of the tribe.

An interesting being mentioned in some of the history writings is ''Kashehotapalo'', a combination of man and deer who delighted in frightening hunters. He was much admired for his speed and agility. If the Choctaws angered ''Kashehotapalo'', he would race ahead of them and warn the enemy or animals being hunted.

''Okwa Naholo'' or ''Oka Nahullo'' (white people of the water) dwelled in deep pools and had light skins like the skins of trout. They were believed to sometimes capture human beings whom they converted into beings like themselves.

''Hoklonote'' was a bad spirit who could assume any shape it desired; it was considered to read people's thoughts.

===Shadow-like beings===
The Choctaws have stories about [[Shadow people|shadow beings]]. ''Nalusa Chito'', also known as a ''Impa Shilup'', was the soul-eater, great black being.&lt;ref name=john_swanton /&gt; If people allow evil thoughts or depression to enter their minds, it would creep inside them and eat their soul.

''Nalusa Falaya'' (long black being) resembled a man, but with very small eyes and long, pointed ears. He sometimes frightened hunters or transferred his power of doing harm. Some believed that ''Nalusa Falaya'' preferred to approach men by sliding on his stomach like a snake.

''Hashok Okwa Hui'ga'' (Grass Water Drop) was believed to have a connection to what is termed [[will-o-the-wisp]]. Only its heart is visible, and that only at night. ''Hashok Okwa Hui'ga'' leads astray anyone who looks at it.

It was also believed that every man had a ''shilombish'' (the outside shadow) which always followed him, and ''shilup'' (the inside shadow, or ghost) which after death goes to the land of ghosts. The ''shilombish'' was supposed to remain upon the earth, and wander restlessly about its former home, often moaning, to frighten its surviving friends, as to make them forsake the spot, and seek another place to live. It was also supposed to assume the form of a fox, or owl; and by barking like the one, and screeching like the other at night, cause great consternation, for the cry was considered ominous of bad things. The Choctaws could tell between the ''shilombish'' and animals it imitates. When a fox barks, or an owl screeches, another fox or owl replies. But when the ''shilombish'' imitates the sound of either animal, no response is given.and the shadow like beings would often stalk children of younger adult age.

===Birds of the dark===
''Ishkitini'', or the horned owl, was believed to prowl about at night killing men and animals. Many believed that when ''ishkitini'' screeched, it meant sudden death, such as a murder. If the ''ofunlo'' (screech owl) was heard, it was a sign that a child under seven in the family was going to die, as the child would be about the size of a small owl. If ''opa'' (a common owl) perched in a barn or on trees near the house and hooted, it foreboded death among the near relatives.

''Biskinik'', the sapsucker, was known as the newsbird. If he landed on a tree in their yard early in the morning, some "hasty" news would come before noon. If he perched there late at night, the news would come before morning.

===Animal-explained occurrences===
Animals figure significantly in Choctaw mythology, as they do in most [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] myth cycles. For example, in Choctaw history, [[solar eclipse]]s were attributed to black squirrels, and [[maize]] was a gift from the birds [http://www.tc.umn.edu/~mboucher/mikebouchweb/choctaw/legends2.htm]

''Heloha'' (thunder) and ''Melatha'' (lightning) were responsible for the dramatic thunderstorms. In Choctaw mythology, they were two huge [[Thunderbird (mythology)|birds]]. ''Heloha'' would lay her giant eggs in the clouds and they would rumble as they rolled around atop the clouds. Despite his size, her mate, ''Melatha'', was extremely fast and left a trail of sparks as he streaked across the sky.

'''Church history''' or '''ecclesiastical history''' as an [[academic discipline]] studies the [[history of Christianity]] and the way the [[Christian Church]] has developed since its inception. 

[[Henry Melvill Gwatkin]] defined church history as "the spiritual side of the history of civilized people ever since our Master's coming".&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Melvill Gwatkin]], ''Early Church History to A.D. 313'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A. M. Renwick, however, defines it as an account of the Church's success and failure in carrying out Christ's [[Great Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Renwick and [[Allan Harman|A. M. Harman]], ''The Story of the Church'' (3rd ed.), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Renwick suggests a fourfold division of church history into [[Mission (Christianity)|missionary activity]], [[Ecclesiastical polity|church organization]], [[Christian theology|doctrine]] and "the effect on human life".

Church history is often, but not always, studied from a Christian perspective. Writers from different Christian traditions will often highlight people and events particularly relevant to their own [[denominational]] history. Catholic and Orthodox writers often highlight the achievements of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]], while [[evangelical]] historians may focus on the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Great Awakening]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6312">In [[sociolinguistics]], the '''curvilinear principle''' states that there is a tendency for linguistic [[change from below]] to originate from members of the central classes in a [[Speech community|speech community's]] socioeconomic hierarchy, rather than from the outermost or exterior classes.&lt;ref name=Labov2001&gt; Labov, William. Principles of Linguistic Change, vol iii: Social Factors. Malden and Oxford: Blackwell. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
[[File:The_Curvilinear_Principle,_Frequency_of_variable_use_according_to_social_class.jpg|thumb|right|Graph demonstrating the curvilinear principle, showing that the frequency of use is highest in the interior classes and lowest in the exterior classes.]]
Defined by [[William Labov]], the curvilinear principle departs from traditional nineteenth century notions that language change generally originates in the highest or lowest classes of society. Instead, it states that variant forms leading to language change are typically introduced and motivated by the intermediate groups—the upper-working class and lower-middle class.&lt;ref name=Labov2001 /&gt;

The principle can be seen as one response to an important question in sociolinguistics known as the ''embedding problem'', a problem "concerned with determining regular patterns in both the linguistic and the extra-linguistic context of change."&lt;ref name=Milroy1985&gt;Milroy, James and Lesley Milroy. "Linguistic Change, Social Network and Speaker Innovation". ''Journal of Linguistics''. 21.2: Sep., 1954. 339-384.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the embedding problem seeks to identify other changes or factors that have a non-coincidental relationship with the actual linguistic change.&lt;ref name=Weinreich1968&gt;Weinreich, U., W. Labov and M. Herzog. 1968. "Empirical foundations for a theory of language change". In W. Lehmann and Y. Malkiel (eds.) Directions for Historical Linguistics. Austin: University of Texas Press. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The curvilinear principle identifies such a non-trivial factor by proposing that a speaker’s class can indicate the degree to which he or she motivates linguistic change.

The principle's name refers to the [[Curve|curvilinear]] correlation that results from plotting the variation of a linguistic variable with respect to the class of the speakers. Because the lowest and highest classes generally tend to use newly emerging forms less frequently than central classes, data points representing variable usage resemble a [[Concave function|concave]] curve when connected on a graph.

==Studies==

===The Philadelphia Study===
In [[The Philadelphia study]], William Labov examined a series of linguistic variables in various stages of speech integration in order to evaluate whether the interior classes were, in fact, the innovators of linguistic change.&lt;ref name=Labov2001 /&gt; In order to determine each speaker’s social position within the community, Labov created a socioeconomic status index based on education and occupation, each ranked on levels from 0 to 6, where 6 was the highest level of education or occupation. He studied a series of “new and vigorous” vowel changes, including the fronting and raising of (aw) and (ey) and the centralization of (ay).&lt;ref name=Labov1984&gt; Labov, William. 1984
“Field methods of the Project on Linguistic Change and Variation.” Language in Use. 43-70. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall. 1984. &lt;/ref&gt; The research found that members of the upper working class and lower middle class used these variables more frequently than members of either the lower or upper class. This corroborated his curvilinear hypothesis because the middle classes were leading the use of these "new and vigorous" linguistic changes.&lt;ref name=Labov2001/&gt;

===Norwich===
In his study of [[Norwich, England]], Peter Trudgill examined different cases of linguistic variation and whether or not class could be related to realizations of certain linguistic variables. One of the observed variables was the [[Received Pronunciation|(RP)]] quality of vowels in words like ''top'', ''hot'', and ''dog''.&lt;ref name=Wardhaugh2006&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald. An Introduction to Sociolinguistics. Malden, Massachusetts:Blackwell Publishing, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; To determine a subject’s class, Trudgill calculated a score for each subject based on six parameters: subject’s occupation, father’s occupation, income, education, locality, and housing.&lt;ref name=Ash2002 &gt;Ash, Sharon. "Social Class."" ''The Handbook of Language Variation and Change,'' 402-422. Malden, Mass: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Trudgill found that middle-class women were introducing the RP vowels in Norwich; working-class men were also introducing variation by borrowing a similar vowel associated with working-class speech from a nearby area.&lt;ref name=Wardhaugh2006 /&gt; The distribution of linguistic variation in Trudgill’s study thus abides by the curvilinear principle because members of the central classes led the change.

===Lower East Side===
In 1966, Labov published a study on linguistic variation on the [[Lower East Side]] neighborhood of [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Labov1966 &gt;Labov, William. The Social Stratification of English in New York City. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the study, he approximated each subject’s class with score that factored in his or her occupation, income, and education.&lt;ref name=Ash2002 /&gt; Using these scores, Labov then grouped the subjects into 5 categories defined by sociologist Joseph Kahl: lower class, working class, lower middle class, upper middle class, and upper class (though Labov noted no subjects were considered upper class and that the presence of any upper-class people living on the Lower East Side would be unexpected).&lt;ref name=Labov1966 /&gt;

One variable considered was (oh), the mid-back rounded vowel present in ''caught'', ''talk'', and ''dog''. Labov found that members of the working class and lower middle class—the central socioeconomic classes of the Lower East Side—used higher vowels for (oh) than did either the lower class or the middle class subjects. Labov recognized this as a linguistic change in progress, driven by the central class in accordance with the curvilinear principle.&lt;ref name=Labov1966 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1446">'''Cú Chonnacht Ó Cianáin''', d. 1615, was a rymer or chronicler to Rory Maguire.

He was apparently the first man racked in Ireland, the instrument being used most severely upon him during an interrogation into a bungled insurrection in early summer 1615. On 31 July of that year, he and five others were condemned to death in [[Derry]], and he is believed to have been hanged shortly afterwards.

He is also described as a [[yeoman]] of Moygh, a place somewhere between [[Ballymoney]] and the [[River Bann|Bann]], [[County Antrim]]. He was a brother of [[Tadhg Og Ó Cianáin]].

The [[surname]] [[Ó Cianáin]] is now generally rendered as [[Keenan (disambiguation)|Keenan]].

'''Edvard Stanislavovich Radzinsky''' ({{lang-ru|Э́двард Станисла́вович Радзи́нский}}) (born September 23, 1936) is a [[Russia]]n playwright, television personality, [[screenwriter]], and the author of more than forty [[popular history]] books.

==Biography==
Edvard Stanislavovich Radzinsky was born in [[Moscow]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] on September 23, 1936 to playwrighter Stanislav Radzinsky and his wife Sofia. He studied in the Moscow Archive Institute and is a trained historian. Edvard married actress Alla Geraskina, herself the daughter of the popular Soviet playwright and writer Lia Geraskina, in 1955. Their son, Oleg was born in 1958. Edvard Radzinsky divorced Alla in 1964. He later married [[Tatiana Doronina]], one of the leading Soviet actresses of the 60s-70s. They divorced later. He is currently married to the actress Elena Denisova.

===Career===
Radzinsky is an author of more than forty popular non-fiction books on historical subjects. Since the 1990s, he has written the series ''Mysteries of History''. The books translated to English include his biographies of Tsars [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]], and [[Joseph Stalin]]. His book ''[[Stalin: The First In-depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives]]'' discusses a number of well known controversies about Joseph Stalin, including the existence of a fuller text of [[Lenin's Testament]], the alleged involvement of Stalin as an agent of the [[Okhrana|Tsarist secret police]], and the role of Stalin in the death of [[Nadezhda Alliluyeva|his wife]] and the murder of [[Sergey Kirov]].&lt;ref&gt;David Brandenberger. Reviewed work(s): ''Stalin: The First In-Depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives'' by Edvard Radzinsky; H. T. Willetts, ''Europe-Asia Studies'', Vol. 49, No. 1 (Jan., 1997), pp. 176-179&lt;/ref&gt; According to Radzinsky, Stalin was poisoned by order of [[Lavrentiy Beria]]. His book includes an interview with a former bodyguard of Stalin, who stated that on the night of Stalin's death, the bodyguards were relieved of duty by an NKVD officer named Khrustalev. This same officer was briefly mentioned in ''Memories'', the memoir of Stalin's daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva]]. Radzinsky also supported the hypothesis by [[Viktor Suvorov]] that Stalin had prepared a [[Soviet offensive plans controversy|preemptive strike]] against Nazi Germany for 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Radzinsky cited a document  preserved in the Military-Memorial Center of the Soviet General Staff, which was a draft of a plan for military strategy in case of war with Germany, drawn up by [[Georgy Zhukov]], dated May 15, 1941, and signed by [[Aleksandr Vasilevsky]] and [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Vatutin|Nikolai Vatutin]]. The document stated: "In view of the fact that Germany at present keeps its army fully mobilized with its rear services deployed, it has the capacity of deploying ahead of us and striking a sudden blow. To prevent this I consider it important not to leave the operational initiative to the German command in any circumstances, but to anticipate the enemy and attack the German army at the moment when it is in the process of deploying and before it has time to organize its front and the coordination of its various arms".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5432">'''Endogenosymbiosis''' is an [[evolution]]ary process, proposed by the evolutionary and environmental biologist Roberto Cazzolla Gatti, in which "gene carriers" ([[virus]]es, [[retrovirus]]es and [[bacteriophage]]s) and symbiotic [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cells ([[bacteria]] or [[archaea]]) could share parts or all of their [[genome]]s in an endogenous symbiotic relationship with their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-10-endogenosymbiosis-hypothesis.html|title=Two new studies confirm the 'endogenosymbiosis' hypothesis |date=October 2016 |work=[[phys.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite biorxiv|last=Gatti |first=Roberto Cazzolla |date=2015 |title=A new idea on the evolution of biodiversity |biorxiv=019828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cazzolla Gatti |first=Roberto|date=2016-03-01|title=A conceptual model of new hypothesis on the evolution of biodiversity |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/biolog.2016.71.issue-3/biolog-2016-0032/biolog-2016-0032.xml?format=INT |journal=Biologia |volume=71 |issue=3 |doi=10.1515/biolog-2016-0032 |issn=1336-9563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==

The related process of [[symbiogenesis]] or endosymbiosis was proposed by [[Lynn Margulis]] in 1967. She argued that the internal symbiosis of bacteria-like organisms had formed organelles like [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. She proposed that this had created the [[eukaryote]]s, and thus driven the expansion of life on Earth. She had argued that this process of symbiotic collaboration had run alongside the classical [[Darwinian]] cycle of [[mutation]], [[natural selection]] and [[adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sagan, Lynn |year=1967 |title=On the origin of mitosing cells |journal=[[J Theor Biol]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–274 |pmid=11541392 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(67)90079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic symbiosis from parasites ==
Roberto Cazzolla Gatti, Ph.D., associate professor at [[Tomsk State University]] (Russia), argued in his hypothesis that "the main likely cause of the evolution of sexual reproduction, the [[parasitism]], also represents the origin of biodiversity". 
In other terms, this theory suggests that sexual reproduction acts as a conservative system against the inclusion of new genetic variations into cells' DNA (supported by the DNA repair systems) and, instead, the evolution of species can take place only when this preservative system fails to contrast the inclusion, within the host genome, of hexogen parts of DNA (and RNA) coming from obliged "parasitic" elements (viruses and phages) that establish a symbiosis with their hosts. 
"As two parallel evolutionary lines – Cazzolla Gatti wrote in his original paper – sexual reproduction seems to preserve what the endogenosymbiosis moves to diversify. Following the former process, the species can adapt slowly and indefinitely to the external factors, adjusting themselves, but not 'creating' novelty. The latter process, instead, leads to the speciation due to sudden changes in genes sequences. Not only organelles can be symbiotic with other cells, as suggested Lynn Margulis, but entire pieces of genetic material coming from symbiotic parasites, can be included in the host DNA, changing the gene expression and addressing the speciation process".

This idea challenges the canonical natural selection models based on the gradualism of the mutation-adaptation pattern, providing more support to the [[punctuated equilibrium theory]] proposed by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]].

== Evidence ==
Two independent studies provide support for the hypothesis. Jamie E. Henzy and Welkin E. Johnson demonstrated that the complex evolutionary history of the IFIT (Interferon Induced proteins with Tetratricopeptide repeats) family of antiviral genes has been shaped by continuous interactions between [[mammal]]ian hosts and their many viruses.&lt;ref&gt;Henzy, J. E., &amp; Johnson, W. E. 2016. Phylogenetic sleuthing reveals pair of paralogous genes. eLife, 5, e17224&lt;/ref&gt;

David Enard and colleagues estimated that viruses have driven close to 30% of all adaptive [[amino acid]] changes in the part of the human proteome conserved within mammals. Their results suggest that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes.&lt;ref&gt;Enard, D., Cai, L., Gwennap, C., &amp; Petrov, D. A. 2016. Viruses are a dominant driver of protein adaptation in mammals. eLife, 5, e12469&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, it was estimated that about 7–8% percent of the entire human genome carry about 100,000 pieces of DNA that came from endogenous [[retrovirus]]es. This may be an underestimate.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 2016 the biologists Sarah R. Bordestein and Seth R. Bordestein reported that genes are frequently transferred between hosts and parasites. Eukaryotic genes are often co-opted by viruses and bacterial genes are commonly found in [[bacteriophage]]s. The presence of bacteriophages in symbiotic bacteria that obligately reside in eukaryotes may promote eukayotic DNA transfers to bacteriophages.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah R. Bordenstein &amp; Seth R. Bordenstein, Eukaryotic association module in phage WO genomes from Wolbachia, Nature Communications 7, Article number: 13155 (2016) doi:10.1038/ncomms13155&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''etymological fallacy''' is a [[genetic fallacy]] that holds that the present-day meaning of a word or phrase should necessarily be similar to [[Semantic change|its historical meaning]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}  This is a [[linguistics|linguistic]] misconception,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth G. Wilson (1993)  "The Columbia Guide to Standard American English", article "Etymological Fallacy"&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes used as a basis for [[linguistic prescription]]. An argument constitutes an etymological fallacy if it makes a claim about the present meaning of a word based exclusively on its etymology.&lt;ref name="Sihler" /&gt;

A variant of the etymological fallacy involves looking for the true meaning of words by delving into their etymologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =  Hutton| first =  Christopher| title = Linguistics and Third Reich| url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=zJ9YUflEreYC| accessdate = 2010-08-01| series = Routledge studies in the history of linguistics| volume = 1| year = 1998| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-203-02101-9| page = 1| quote = [...] allegedly absurd beliefs such as the etymological 'fallacy' (i.e. the assertion that the true meaning of a word is to be sought in its etymology).}}&lt;/ref&gt; or claiming that a word should be used in a particular way because it has a particular etymology. 

==Occurrence and examples==

An etymological fallacy becomes possible when a word has [[Semantic change|changed its meaning]] over time. Such changes can include a shift in scope (narrowing or widening of meanings) or of connotation (amelioration or pejoration). In some cases, meanings can also shift completely, so that the etymological meaning has no evident connection to the current meaning.&lt;ref name="Sihler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sihler|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Sihler|title=Language History|series=Amsterdam studies in the theory and history of linguistic science. Series IV, Current issues in linguistic theory|volume=191|year=2000|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia|isbn=90-272-3698-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greeks]] believed that there was a "true meaning" of a word, distinct from a common use. There is evidence that a similar belief existed among ancient [[Vedic]] scholars. In modern days this fallacy may be found in some arguments of [[language purist]]s.&lt;ref name="Sihler" /&gt;

Not every change in meaning leads to an etymological fallacy, but such changes are frequently the basis of inaccurate arguments.

An example of a word which has greatly changed its meaning is ''[[Decimation_(Roman_army)|decimation]]'', which originally referred to reduction by a tenth, but now usually means a drastic reduction or complete destruction.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' ''s.v.'' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/48201 decimation], [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/48200 decimate]&lt;/ref&gt; Insisting that only the original meaning is "true" constitutes an etymological fallacy.&lt;ref name="Sihler" /&gt;

[[File:Xavier-Hernandez-Cardona.jpg|right|248x248px|thumb|Francesc Xavier Hernández Cardona]]
'''Francesc Xavier Hernández Cardona''' ([[Barcelona]], 1954) is a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[historian]], Professor of Didactics of Social Sciences of the [[University of Barcelona]].

In 1979 he got a degree in [[Philosophy and literature|Philosophy and Literature]], Section of Modern and Contemporary History, at the [[University of Barcelona]], with the thesis entitled "The MLE (Spanish Libertarian Movement) and its development in Catalonia (1939-1945)", directed by Josep Termes.

In 1993 he earned a doctorate at the same university with the thesis (in Catalan) titled "The History of Catalonia in the Primary and Secondary School (1975-1990)", directed by Pelai Pagès.

He has developed his research and teaching career in specialties like Didactics of History and Social Sciences, Didactics of Heritage, Historical Iconography, Didactic Museography and Military History of Catalonia.

==Academic and management career==
Since 1979 he worked as a lecturer in the University School of Teacher Education for Educación General Básica (EGB) of the [[University of Barcelona]]. In 1984 he became tenured lecturer of University School, in 1995 tenured lecturer at the University of Barcelona where in 2003 obtained the Chair as Professor of Didactics of the Social Sciences.

From 1999 to 2002 he served as President of the Division of Education Sciences of the [[University of Barcelona]] and since 2008 to 2015 was Director of the Department of Didactics of Social Sciences at the same institution. On behalf of the party [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]] had the charge of General Director of Research of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] in the tripartite Government of Pasqual Maragall from 2003–2006, while Carles Solà to be Counselor of the Department of Universities, Research and Information Society. He renewed his charge as General Director of Research during the first months of the second tripartite Government, while Josep Huguet to be Counselor of the Department of Innovation, Universities and Enterprise. In March 2007 he resigned because in his opinion the Government of the Generalitat did not give strategic priority to research.

As General Director General of Research strengthened the system of research in Catalonia and promoted the creation of numerous recognized centers. During this time several institutions were launched to form the backbone of the Catalan research system:
* The Superocomputador Mare Nostrum (Centre de Supercomputació de Barcelona)
* The Parc de Recerca Biomèdica de Barcelona (PRBB)
* The Institut de Recerca Biomèdica de Barcelona (IRBB)
* The Institut de Bioenginyeria de Catalunya (IBEC)
* The Institut Català de Nanotecnologia (ICN)
* The Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont
* The Institut Català de Recerca de l'Aigua (ICRA)
* The Institut de Recerca en Energia de Catalunya (IREC)
* The Institut Català de Ciències del Clima (IC3)
* The Centre de Recerca en Epidemiologia Ambiental (CREAL)
* The Centre de Medecina Regenerativa de Barcelona (CMRB)
* The Centre de Recerca en Salut Internacional de Barcelona (CRESIB)
* The Institut de Medecina Predictiva i Personalitzada del Càncer (IMPPC)
* The Centre de Recerca en Agrigenòmica (CRA)
* The Institut Català de Recerca en Patrimoni Cultural (ICRPC)
* The Institut Català de Paleoecologia Humana i Evolució Social (ICPHES)
* The Centre Esther Koplowitz (CEK)

He also collaborated in strengthening and creating new headquarters of research centres such as:

* The Institut de Ciències Fotòniques (ICFO)
* The Institut Català d'Investigació Química (ICIQ)
* The Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS)
* The Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC)
* The Institut d'Estudis Espacials de Catalunya (IEEC)
* The Institut Català d'Arqueologia Clàssica (ICAC)

The [[ALBA (synchrotron)|ALBA Synchrotron]] works were undertaken during his tenure. In order to generate a powerful research network promoted the creation of a Catalan Agency for Research, inspired by the German model of the Max-Planck- and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, attempt which did not succeed because the seventh legislature came to a sudden end. For the same reason it was not possible to enact a Law of Science giving coverage to research strategies. He tried to link organically the Catalan research system with the French one, and important advances were aborted by the political situation.

Among the measures that he drove: the transformation of FI scholarship programme into contracts of employment of 3 years (plus 1 of previous grant); the creation of post-doctoral programme Beatriu de Pinós, oriented to the employment insertion of research personnel in companies; the creation of the Junior ICREA programme and the stabilization of the researchers belonging to the programme Ramon y Cajal. These initiatives were meant to lay the foundations of a research career in Catalonia. He also systematized and prompted calls and various research structures like the SGR (Support Grups de Recerca; a Support for research groups), ARIE (Ajunts per a la Recerca, Innovació i Educació); XIRE (Xarxes d'Innovació i Recerca Educativa); or Excava, to promote Catalan archaeological missions abroad (Althiburos, Oxirrinc, Bactriana, Syria, among others).

Aside from these initiatives he also made possible the work of prominent researchers in Catalonia, such as Joan Massagué, Manuel Perucho or Juan Carlos Izpisúa.

==History and Didactics of History==
He worked as a teacher in Primary and Secondary education. His career as University tenured lecturer and Professor of University has been linked to the teaching of the Social Sciences, Didactics of History and Didactics of the Heritage.

He took part in the most diverse initiatives of educational research and innovation. He was the editor of the experimental curricula projects of Social and Cultural Environment (Primary Education) and Social Sciences (12-16) for the Educational Reform promoted by the Generalitat de Catalunya at the end of the 20th century.

He is a member of the Editorial Board of the journal ''Guix'' and was founder and co-director of the journal ''Iber: Didactics of Social Sciences, Geography and History''. He did research on textbooks and has also generated models for Primary and Secondary School based on the interaction between image and text, which have been widely replicated since the end of the 20th century to the present day. Major collections include Barcanova and Teide.

Hernández has also collaborated in the development of new types of educational materials based on the design of books of activities which integrate documentation and learning resources. He advocates for the application of the scientific method in the classroom, has developed various proposals to promote, using the discovery strategy, the work with different types of historical sources. In this sense, he conducted his doctoral thesis on the image of Catalonia in textbooks during post-Franco age: "La Història de Catalunya a l'ensenyament primari i secundari (1975-1990)".

He is author of numerous articles and books of theoretical reflection on the teaching of history and Social Sciences: ''Didáctica de las Ciencias Sociales''; ''Ensenyar Història de Catalunya''; ''12 ideas clave: Enseñar y aprender historia''. He has also written several books to disseminate history, as well as monographs on unique topics. He has published many papers and books of history including several synthesis of the history of Catalonia.

He has been main investigator of many competitive projects, among other four R&amp;D of the Spanish "National Plan for Research". The bodies of the State (CNEAI) have recognized his work as researcher by granting him with four periods of six years ("Sexenios de investigación" in Spanish).

==Historical iconography==
He has developed several works of innovation and research focused on the importance of the didactic iconography in history, and has applied the results in the preparation of social dissemination and textbooks. It has also developed models of virtual reconstruction of archaeological sites that help formulate hypothesis about parts and uses of buildings and urban ensembles.

It has tackled the challenge of recreating the evolution of a city in a limited space. The work carried out on the Iberian Citadel of Calafell (Tarragona); the Iberian settlement of Puig Castellar (Santa Coloma de Gramenet, Barcelona); the site of Empúries (Girona) and the recreation of the Roman city of Althiburos (Tunisia) and the city of Barcelona in the 18th century, among others, are the most outstanding experiences.

On the basis of the contributions of the British illustrator David Macaulay has created generic models of city and has recreated iconically its evolution over time. This work was developed in collaboration with the extraordinary illustrator Jordi Ballonga. The results were published by the Milanese publishing Jaca Book between 1990 and 1993, translated into different languages, and published in different countries (Italy, France, United Kingdom, Hungary, Netherlands, Romania, Tunisia, Spain -Catalan and Spanish editions-, United States, Japan and Germany). Three city models were designed: BARMI, a Mediterranean city in southern Europe; LEBEK, a city in Northern Europe; and SAN RAFAEL, a city in Central America.
[[File:Francesc Xavier Hernandez Patrimoni.jpg|thumb|248x248px|Francesc Xavier Hernández Cardona, specialist in Didactics of History and Heritage, has developed models of iconography on the historical evolution of urban centres.]]
In the context of the Tricentenari (1714–2014), and in collaboration with Guillem Hernández Pongiluppi, he presented an ambitious iconographic proposal around the siege of Barcelona in 1713-1714 and the battle of 11 September.
He has also collaborated with various artists (John Chien, Francesc Riart, Guillem Hernández, Mar Hernández) on issues related to the military defense and fortification, military technology and weaponry. 
Noteworthy is the impulse of new iconographic, digital strategies and matte painting, with illustrators such as Guillem Hernández Pongiluppi and Mar Hernández Pongiluppi.

==Didactic museology==
He started his activities in museography in 1992, working in the project of partial restitution of the Iberian Citadel of Calafell (Tarragona), inspired by the educational experience of Lejre (Denmark). The relationship with Calafell finished with the musealisation of 1996. Almost in parallel, he coordinated the historical and museological executive project of the History Museum of Catalonia, which is implemented in a record time of 18 months and that was one of the first models in Europe in the field of didactic and interactive museology on history. The relationship of consultancy with the Museum ended in 1997 because of the regressive policy, in terms of interactive museography, imposed by the direction of the Museum. In the following years he criticized the policies driven by the direction teams of the Museum, the falsification and degradation of the original project and the lack of goals of the institution.
 
He has been Commissioner (along with [[Joaquim Torra]]) of the temporary exhibition "Donec Perficiam" installed in 2013 at the Born in Barcelona. It was one of the most visited temporary exhibitions of the city. The work explained the siege of Barcelona and stands as a model in museography by its modern conception, by the success of visitors, by the variety of museological strategies used, and also because of a quick design and implementation at low cost. Definitely it was the most successful exhibition in the context of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of 1714.

In his museography works he has promoted the concepts of didactic museology and educational heritage, assuming that the democratization of the access to knowledge requires museological and museographical proposals with a capacity to be understood by a broad target horizon.

In collaboration with Dr. Joan Santacana Mestre created in 2000 the research group "Didactics of Heritage, Comprehensive museology and new technologies" (DIDPATRI) and, within the framework of the Foundation Bosch i Gimpera and the Attica project, the quasi-firm "Projects Workshop: Heritage and museology".

He has coordinated and worked in numerous museological and museographic projects. Among others, he has participated in the design of projects for centers such as the Archaeological Museum of Catalonia, the monumental site of Empúries and the Maritime Museum of Barcelona. He has also worked in various executive projects as:

* Walls of Ceuta (Spain)
* Walls of Melilla (Spain)
* Castros and Verracos Trail (Salamanca, Spain)
* Interpretation Centre of Madina Yabisa (Ibiza, Spain)
* Walls of Dalt Vila (Ibiza, Spain)
* Interpretation Centre of Republican Aviation and Air War (Santa Margarida i els Monjos, Barcelona, Spain)
* Interpretation Centre of Talamanca Battle (Barcelona, Spain)
* Audiovisual Room at the San Fernando Castle (Figueres, Girona, Spain)

He collaborated in the founding of the UB-Projects project, an agreement between the University of Barcelona and the Euphon Group, and other collaboration agreements with different companies. He was co-director of the master's degree in Didactics of Museology (Les Heures-University of Barcelona).

He has directed several doctoral theses on aspects of history, heritage, museology and didactics (Dr. Josep Antoni Serra, Dr. Rafael Sospedra, Dr. Andreu Besolí, Dr. Ismael Almazán, Dr. Xavier Rubio, Dr. David Íñiguez and Dr. Pilar Molina).

He is author of numerous works and articles on museology and museology, such as ''Museologia crítica'' and ''Museos de historia. Entre la taxidermia y el nomadismo,'' both co-authored with Joan Santacana.

Hernández has participated in the didactic and cultural proposal for the revitalization of the excavations at Althiburos (Tunis).

He is coordinator of the consolidated research group of the Generalitat de Catalunya "DIDPATRI: Didactics of Cultural Heritage" (SGR 2009-245; SGR 2012-945), whose research focuses on the field of didactic museography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.didpatri.cat Website of the Research Group "DIDPATRI: Didactics of Cultural Heritage" (University of Barcelona)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lately, he works on projects related to emerging lines of research such as museology and iconography, digital iconographic resources and uses of internet for museographic purposes.
[[File:Francesc Xavier Hernandez Normandia.jpg|thumb|248x248px|Francesc Xavier Hernández Cardona has developed numerous works and researches in the field of military history.]]

==Military history==
He has a specialization in military history and currently is developing work and research in this field. One of his most emblematic works is the publication in 4 volumes of the military history of Catalonia (''Història Militar de Catalunya''), as well as the supplementary material elaborated together with Francesc Riart on uniforms of the armies during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the Coronela and uniform studies in the Catalan countries.

Among the most notable unique contributions is the interpretation of the battles of Empúries (195 BC) and [[Battle of Muret]] (1213); as well as the hypotheses about the Empúries geography during Ancient and Medieval History, proposals drawn up based on the use of primary sources, simulation, game theory, fieldwork and aerial photograph. He actively promoted the recovery of the historical landscapes of the [[Battle of the Ebro]], with works of research and dissemination: ''Ebro 1938'' and ''La Batalla de l'Ebre: Història, paisatge i patrimoni''. He has carried out field activities to identify specific areas of the battlefield and also participated in civic campaigns in defense of the integrity of the mountains of Pàndols and Cavalls (Tarragona).

Regarding his archaeological works, he took park as member of DIDPATRI in the excavation of La Fatarella battlefield in collaboration with CSIC and the Association Lo Riu, and have also been relevant his works in the fields of Republican Aviation in the Penedés area in collaboration with the Institut d'Estudis Penedesencs.

He was author to the first attempt to write an Management Plan of the Historical Landscapse of the battle of the Ebro promoted by the Ministry of Territorial Policy and Public Works of the Generalitat de Catalunya.

Hernández has studied together with Francesc Riart and Xavier Rubio, the problem of creation of the Catalan army and La Coronela in 1713-1714. In collaboration with Francesc Riart has written the first illustrated atlas of uniform studies of the Catalan Countries and has also worked on the innovative work undertaken by Xavier Rubio on historical analysis, simulation and supercomputing. He was founder and first co-Editor of the journal ''Ebre 38: Revista Internacional de la Guerra Civil Espanyola'' ''(1936-1939)''. He has participated in the musealisation of large military sites: Dalt Vila (Ibiza), Walls of Ceuta and Melilla. Also has coordinated or participated in the first archaeological excavations of battlefields in Catalonia: Talamanca (2008), Cardedeu (2008), Prats de Rei (2009), Vesper de la Gloriosa (2010), Ordal (2010) and La Fatarella (2011).

==History of Barcelona and of the Cerdà Plan==
His interest in the history of Barcelona has resulted in a co-authored work: "Passat i present de Barcelona", written between 1983 and 1991 in collaboration with Magda Fernández, Mercè Tatjer, Mercè Vidal and Alicia Suárez. Three edited volumes and a non-published fourth one show in a didactic fashion the evolution of the city of Barcelona from the origins up to the Olympic Games in 1992. Later, he wrote as a single author a synthesis of history of the city and several works on the history of the District of Sants. Of special interest was the recovery and publication of the inventory of the Vapor Vell de Sants in the year 1847, a crucial document to better understand the process of industrialization in Barcelona.

One of his most relevant contributions has been the cabalistic theory in the design of the Eixample quarter of Barcelona. Francesc Xavier Hernández has propugned the possibility of Ildefonso Cerdà as a designer of a new city as the capital of a new country, based on the [[Kabbalah]], in the context of the rise of the Catalan Freemasonry during the 19th century.
[[File:Francesc Xavier Hernandez Despatx.JPG|thumb|248x248px|Francesc Xavier Hernández Cardona is Professor of Didactics of Social Sciences of the University of Barcelona.]]

==Social and political activity==
Hernández has been involved in various civic movements in defence of the heritage. His contribution was relevant in the campaign in defense of the Vapor Vell de Sants, which was emblematic as it marked the beginning of the recovery of the industrial heritage in Catalonia. Also participated in the defense of the mountains of Pàndols and Cavalls against the installation of wind farms. His activism was important in the processes of defense and recovery of the historical landscapes of the [[Battle of the Ebro]] and other sites related to the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He participated very actively in the defense of the historical site of the Born market of Barcelona and its archaeological remains on the street of Sant Honorat.

As General Director of Research of the Generalitat de Catalunya, he decidedly opposed Ley de Fosas because in his understanding it was an instrument to prevent research on disappeared persons during the [[Spanish Civil War]] in Catalonia. At the same time he provided the funds to start the excavation of mass graves in Catalonia, which was neutralized by the Memorial Democràtic and the Vice President of the Catalan Government environment. Some of the archaeological campaigns in which he participated between 2003 and 2011, involving the recovery of bodies of soldiers (Albinyana, Gandesa, Castellbisbal, La Fatarella) were disabled or sabotaged by the Generalitat.

Finally, Hernández has taken part in neighbourhood movements and he has served on several occasions as a union representative. Since 1970 he held against the Franco regime and also participated actively in the promotion of militant democracy in different parties and labor unions.

'''Ginés de Mafra''' (1493–1546) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] or [[Spanish people|Spanish]] explorer who sailed to the [[Philippines]] in the 16th century. De Mafra was a member of the expeditions of [[Fernão de Magalhães]] of 1519–1521 and [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] of 1542–1545.

== History ==

=== Voyage to the Philippine Islands===
De Mafra was born in the town of [[Mafra, Portugal|Mafra]], north of Lisbon, [[Portugal]], or, according to other sources, in the town of [[Jérez de la Frontera]], in [[Cadiz]], [[Andalusia]]. In 1519, he became a crew member of the Magalhães expedition. De Mafra started as a seaman in the galleon ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'', the armada's [[flagship]], and was on board when the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] captured the Spanish vessel at Benaconora, today [[Jailolo (town)|Jailolo]], in the [[Moluccas]]. He was imprisoned for 5 months at Ternate (20&amp;nbsp;km south of Benaconora), transferred to a jail at [[Banda Islands]] where he remained for 4 months. Thereafter he was transferred to Malacca for 5 months after what he was brought to [[Cochin]], [[India]], where he languished for two years. De Mafra was finally brought by the Portuguese to Lisbon together with his crew members including Gonzalo Gómez de Espinosa and Hans Bergen. Upon their arrival in Portugal in 1526 de Mafra, and his crew members were thrown in prison. Bergen died in jail while Espinosa was later released that year. De Mafra himself was detained due to his possession of important documents which included the books and papers from the ''Trinidad''. The manuscripts included navigational notes of Andrés de San Martín, who was the fleet's chief pilot and astrologer. It was later taken and mined by Portuguese historians. These manuscripts were later transferred to Spain during the [[Iberian Union]] in 1580-1640. The letters were accessed by several Spanish chroniclers, including [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]. These papers have been lost and now exist only in quotes, references, and citations by these historians.

=== Finally freed only to find his wife had remarried ===
After numerous pleas by de Mafra to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Spain]] to have him released, he was freed in early 1527, and immediately proceeded to Spain. He was given an audience with the emperor after which he went straight to Palos only to discover his wife, Catalina Martínez del Mercado, believing he had died during the voyage, had remarried, and sold their personal fortunes, and land properties. De Mafra wrote to the emperor complaining of his marital trouble, and asking for his intercession for the return of his possessions. The emperor agreed, and ordered an investigation be made by officials, and to have the matter resolved.

=== The New World expedition ===
De Mafra goes back to the sea in 1531, and sails to [[Central America|Central]], and [[South America]]. The governor of [[Guatemala]], [[Pedro de Alvarado]], in a letter written on November 20, 1536, tells the emperor he had hired the services of de Mafra as pilot, who is considered as one of the best sailors due to his experiences with the Magellan voyage. It's not clear where the expedition went but most scholars believe the fleet went to [[Peru]].

=== The Villalobos expedition (1542-1546)===
De Mafra joined the expedition of [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] as pilot of the ''San Juan'', one of six ships. Thus it is a mystery that many scholars have been trying to solve, when we find him as one of the men of the galleon ''San Cristobal'' who made it to the port of [[Mazaua]] in 1543. The galleon was separated from the fleet during a severe storm as the ships sailed between [[Eniwetok]] and [[Ulithi]]. While stranded in one of those islands, he writes a document of the Magellan voyage, he talks about the meeting of Rajah Siaiu the chieftain of Mazaua. De Mafra wrote, "This same chief [Rajah Siaiu] we saw in the year fifteen forty-three by those of us in the fleet of general Ruy López de Villalobos, and he still remembered Magellan, and displayed to us some of the things he [Magellan] had given him." According to [[Italy|Italian]] historian [[Antonio Pigafetta]], "Magellan's gift consisted of a garment of red, and yellow cloth made in the Turkish fashion, a red cap, knives, and mirrors". De Mafra, and his crew members stayed in the island for about 5 to 6 months. This long stay suggested they had to repair the ''San Cristobal'' as it must have been damaged by the fierce storm. De Mafra was one of 117 survivors of the failed Villalobos expedition who made it to Malacca. There De Mafra, age 53, elected to stay together with 29 other crew members. The other survivors sailed for Lisbon in a Portuguese ship. De Mafra handed his manuscript to an unnamed sailor; this eventually reached Spain in transcribed form by an unknown editor where it remained hidden for many centuries in the ''Archive of the Indies'' in Madrid . It was eventually discovered and published in 1920.

=== Geographical mysteries ===
De Mafra's document has been examined by American geographer Donald D. Brand. Brand dismissed it as nothing more than what de Mafra recalled on Andrés de San Martín writings, which de Mafra had with him until these were confiscated in Lisbon. "It should be pointed out here that the previously unknown, ''Descripción de los reinos, Libro que trata del descubrimiento y principio del estrecho que se llama de Magallanes, por Ginés de Mafra'', published in Madrid, 1920 in ''Tres Relaciones'' could not be based on more than Mafra's memory of what he might have read in a Tratado begun by San Martín." This dismissive charge unargued, and unproved, was echoed by Martín Torodash, and Philippine religious historian John N. Schumacher, and influenced the thinking of many other scholars including the ethnographer historian William H. Scott. This explains why the unsolved information to the geographical mystery of [[Mazaua]] has remained buried in his record. Laurence Bergreen gave due recognition of de Mafra's document in Bergreen's 2003 work titled ''Over the Edge of the World, Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe''. It is this document that makes his information an incomparably important geographical testimony that unlocks the mystery of the island of Mazaua.

De Mafra wrote that Magellan's port was an isle with a circumference of 3-4 leagues or 9-12 nautical miles. ''"Y otro dia luego partió''  [Magallanes]  ''de esta isla, y navegando su viage llego a otra isla que tendra de circuito de tres hasta cuatro leguas"''. ("And after another day he [Magellan] left this island [Homonhon], and sailing on his way arrived at another [Mazaua] three or four leagues in circumference.") Because the shape of the isle is almost circular, 3-4 leagues translate to an area of from 2,214 up to 3,930 hectares. In contrast, Limasawa is only 698 hectares. He also stated, they anchored west of the isle: ''"Esta isla tiene un puerto bueno a la parte del poniente della, y es poblada."'' ("This island called Mazaua has a good harbor on its western side, and is inhabited"). Mazaua is officially, by Philippine law, declared as the island of Limasawa, an isle without anchorage, and the port is located east of the island. De Mafra's most clarifying testimony is that Mazaua was 15 leagues, roughly {{convert|45|nmi|km|0}}, below [[Butuan]] in 1521 which in Pigafetta's map, and text is a larger geographical conception than the present-day map. The land area starts from present day [[Surigao City|Surigao]], and extends all the way to [[Zamboanga del Norte]]. De Mafra writes in Spanish: ''"De este Señor de Maçagua"'' [Rajah Siaiu] ''"supo Magallanes que en una provincia que se llamaba Butuan que es en la isla de Mindanao que es de la parte del norte della quince leguas de Maçagua habia gran cantidad de oro." '' ("From the chief of Mazaua" Rajah Siaiu "Magellan learned that a province called Butuan, on the island of [[Mindanao]], which is somewhere fifteen leagues to the north of Mazaua, possessed a large quantity of gold.") This puts the port of Mazaua at 9° N, the exact latitude for it by the Genoese Pilot, one of those who wrote an eyewitness document. All these information revolutionize geographical conception of Mazaua. Limasawa, which has been affirmed thrice by the Philippines' National Historical Institute, to be Mazaua is rectangular in shape, 698 hectares in area, and is reached by a track that is not drawn by any of the document. What is most telling is that Limasawa has no anchorage, As stated by the coast pilot, "Limasawa is fringed by a narrow, steep-to reef, off which the depths are too great to afford anchorage for large vessels."

=== The mysterious isle===
Armed with the insight from De Mafra's information, a team of archaeologists led by a geomorphologist went to work to validate the theory Mazaua is in 9°N. In January 2001, an incredible discovery met the earth scientists: the geo-political entities composed of Pinamanculan and Bancasi inside Butuan in northern Mindanao was in fact an island. From that point on the archaeologists went to work to find artefacts that would identify the isle as the port of Magellan. Age of contact ceramics, disarticulated human bones have been found that show the isle was inhabited before the Spanish arrival. Corroded iron, metal bracelets, and a brass pestle have been dug up that however have yet to be dated. The excavation was done in places outside the suspected village where the indigenous tribes of Mazaua had lived.

However scientists have not yet examined the entire isle including its coastal regions. At the moment no authenticated physical evidence traceable to Magellan and De Mafra and other known European visitors who visited the island-port has been found. As of today, geologists and archaeologists are still digging and investigating the site.

'''Géraud de Cordemoy''' (6 October 1626 in [[Paris]] – 15 October 1684 in Paris) was a French [[philosopher]], [[historian]] and [[lawyer]]. He is mainly known for his works in [[metaphysics]] and for his theory of language.

[[File:Géraud de Cordemoy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Portrait of Géraud de Cordemoy in the 1704 edition of the complete works]]

==Biography==

Géraud de Cordemoy was born in a family of ancient nobility coming from Auvergne (from the town of Royat). He was the third of four children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/cordemoy/|title=Géraud de Cordemoy|last=Ablondi|first=Fred|date=2014-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a master in arts at the [[University of Paris]] named Géraud de Cordemoy who died when he was nine years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His mother was named Nicole de Cordemoy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As for Géraud, he was a private tutor and a [[linguist]] and practised as a lawyer.

Géraud de Cordemoy used to haunt the philosophical circles of the capital; he made acquaintance with [[Emmanuel Maignan]] and [[Jacques Rohault]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosmovisions.com/Rohault.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A friend and a [[protégé]] of [[Louis Bossuet|Bossuet]] who admired [[René Descartes|Descartes]] too, Géraud de Cordemoy was appointed ''lecteur'' (tutor) to the [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661–1711)|Dauphin]] (son of [[King Louis XIV]]), at the same time as [[Fléchier]]. He was elected a member of [[Académie française]] in 1675.

==Works==

Cordemoy is known primarily for having rethought the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] theory of [[causality]], introducing the notion of "occasional cause" within a system of thought which remains essentially Cartesian. He was, alongside [[Arnold Geulincx]] and [[Louis de La Forge]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Louis de La Forge]]&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of what is called "[[occasionalism]]". Body and soul are distinct by essence, their combination is occasional, and it is God who allows that the will to move my arm, for example, is translated into a movement. My will is an occasional cause of the movement of my arm, God is the real cause of it. What is true for the body-an individual constituted by the distinct combination of body and soul- is true for every body in the universe. God is the real and universal cause of every movement.

By body, Cordemoy means the ultimate components of matter. Using a judicial figure of speech, he shows that the body, in law a person, in physics an ultimate component of matter, is indivisible. Never mentioning atomism, with that theory he comes close to the followers of [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] and to the free thinkers, the so-called [[Libertine]]s. In his work "Le discernement du corps et de l’âme" (Discrimination between body and soul) he develops such thoughts which were criticized at that time by the followers of Descartes.

In his work ''Discours physique de la parole'' (Physical Discourse on Speech), he asks himself the following question: "How can I, as a thinking being, be certain that the human beings who surround me are also thinking beings, and not simple automatons? The problem is considered at the end of the sixth speech on discrimination between body and soul. It is the word as a vehicle of the thought which will enable me to know the existence of other individuals who are endowed with a soul like me." In a more original way, in his work "Traité physique de la parole"( physical treatise of the word)- a variation of the previous title -  he develops the notion that no motivated relation between the material sign and the expressed idea exists, as much as no real relation exists between body and soul. The word represents the opportunity for sign and meaning to meet, so far as if the soul hadn’t the use of the articulated body to produce sign, it would communicate in a much more immediate way from soul to soul, without having to go through the institution of the sign.

The language used by human beings is therefore too complex to be explained by purely mechanical causes; I can deduce from it that the bodies I can see are also endowed with a soul. Animals may utter sounds and parrots may reproduce words, only human beings are able to communicate ideas, and that shows the presence of a rational soul. This rational soul is able to communicate directly with angels without going through the physical articulation of the sign. ''Le Discours'', from which [[Molière]] drew the scene of the spelling lesson in ''[[Le Bourgeois gentilhomme]]'', remains the most successful work of Cordemoy. American linguists such as [[George Boas]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] rediscovered him during the sixties.

Cordemoy is also known for his ''Histoire de France'' on which he worked for 18 years without ever seeing the end, so major were the contradictions he came up against while consulting the works of his predecessors. The work was finally finished by his elder son, Louis-Géraud de Cordemoy, and published after his death. [[Voltaire]] said of the work of Cordemoy as a historian : "He was the first to be able to disentangle the chaos of the two first races of the kings of [[France]]; thanks to the [[Charles de Sainte-Maure, duc de Montausier|duke of Montausier]] who charged Cordemoy with the writing of the history of [[Charlemagne]] in view of the education of ''Monseigneur'' [the Dauphin], that useful work was achieved. He found in ancient authors nothing but absurdities and contradictions. That very difficulty encouraged him, and enabled him to disentangle the two first races".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3814">'''Inger Zachrisson''' (born 1936) is a Swedish archaeologist specializing in the history of the [[Sami people]]. As Associate Professor of Archaeology at [[Uppsala University]] and former curator of Stockholm's [[Swedish History Museum|History Museum]], she has researched Sami archaeology and history since the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name=littvet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littvet.uu.se/digitalAssets/554/554850_3vvpp-19-oktober-inger-zachrisson.pdf|title=South Saami prehistory in Mid-Scandinavia|publisher=Uppsala University|accessdate=19 October 2016 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roslund2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roslund|first=Mats|title=Guests in the House: Cultural Transmission between Slavs and Scandinavians 900 to 1300 AD|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1POvCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-474-2185-6|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zachrisson ran the South Sami project from 1984 to 1998, leading to her ''Möten i gränsland. Samer och germaner i Mellanskandinavien'' (Encounters in Border Country: Saami and Germanic peoples in central Scandinavia), published in 1997. She has revealed that from the Late Stone Age in [[Scandinavia]], there were two cultural traditions, the Sami in the north-east and the Scandinavians in the south-west. Her archaeological finds and linguistic analyses show that from the year dot until 1300 AD, there were increasing contacts between the two groups.&lt;ref name=littvet/&gt; Her work on the 11th and 12th-century burial site [[Vivallen]] in [[Härjedalen]] on the Swedish-Norwegian border showed that what had been considered to be Viking graves were in fact Viking merchants buried in the Sami tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=4416&amp;artikel=6372241|title=Historiska museet lyfter fram samernas roll under vikingatiden|publisher=Sveriges Radio|accessdate=19 October 2016 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings of wool and linen clothing, brooches and rings at the site also demonstrated the level of contact between the Scandinavians and the Sami who maintained their non-Christian traditions.&lt;ref name="DuBois1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=DuBois|first=Thomas|title=Nordic Religions in the Viking Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2-Lga0r62MC&amp;pg=PA23|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1714-4|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] he held the offices of [[Drungarios of the Vigla|head justice]] and private secretary (''[[Protasekretis|protasēkrētis]]'') to the emperor, but after Alexios' death, he retired to the monastery in the Island of [[Saint Glyceria | Hagia Glykeria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fresco|first1=Karen L.|last2=Wright|first2=Charles D. (ed.)|title=Translating the Middle Ages|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxford, New York|isbn=9781315549965|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMyXCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=Sep 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Incir Ada]], in the [[Aegean Sea]]), where he spent the rest of his life writing books.

== Written works ==
His most important work, ''Extracts of History'' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Ἐπιτομὴ Ἱστοριῶν}}}}, {{lang-la|Epitome Historiarum}}), in eighteen books, extends from the creation of the world to the death of Alexius (1118). The earlier part is largely drawn from [[Josephus]]; for Roman history he chiefly followed [[Cassius Dio]] up to the early third century. Contemporary scholars are particularly interested in his account of the third and fourth centuries, which depend upon sources, now lost, whose nature is fiercely debated. Central to this debate is the work of Bruno Bleckmann, whose arguments tend to be supported by continental scholars but rejected in part by English-speaking scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, ''Die Reichskrise des III. Jahrhunderts in der spätantiken und byzantinischen Geschichtsschreibung : Untersuchungen zu den nachdionischen Quellen der Chronik des Johannes Zonaras''. Munich, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation of these important sections has recently been published: Thomas Banchich and Eugene Lane, ''The History of Zonaras from Alexander Severus to the Death of Theodosius the Great'' (Routledge 2009). The chief original part of Zonaras' history is the section on the reign of [[Alexios I Komnenos]], whom he criticizes for the favour shown to members of his family, to whom Alexios entrusted vast estates and significant state offices. His history was continued by [[Niketas Choniates|Nicetas Acominatus]].

Various ecclesiastical works have been attributed to Zonaras — commentaries on the Church Fathers and the poems of [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]; lives of Saints; and a treatise on the [[Canons of the Apostles| Apostolic Canons]] — and there is no reason to doubt their genuineness. The lexicon, however, which has been handed down under his name (ed. [[J. A. H. Tittmann]] 1808) is probably the work of a certain [[Antonius Monachus]] (Stein's [[Herodotus]], ii. 479 f).

The first ecclesiastical denunciation of the game of [[chess]] on the part of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was voiced by Zonaras. It was during his retirement as a monk to the monastery of [[Mount Athos]] that he wrote his commentary on the canons of the Eastern Church. The [[Quinisext Council]] required both clergy and laity to give up the use of dice (Canon 50).  Zonaras wanted chess to also be included for clergy and laity to give up. Zonaras, commenting on Canon 50, wrote, "Because there are some of the Bishops and clergy who depart from virtue and play chess (''zatikron'') or dice or drink to excess, the Rule commands that such shall cease to do so or be excluded; and if a Bishop or elder or deacon or subdeacon or reader or singer do not cease so to do, he shall be cast out: and if laymen be given to chess-playing and drunkenness, they shall be excluded."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8900">The '''Kashubian diaspora''' resulted from the emigration of [[Kashubians]], in two waves occurring in the second half of the 19th century.  The majority of Kashubian emigrants settled in the United States; others emigrated to Canada and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Popowska-Taborska, ''Kaszubszczyzna: zarys dziejów'' (Warszawa, 1980), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; An online genealogical project, "The Great Kashubian Migration," is devoted to tracking their settlement patterns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/projects/The-Great-Kashubian-Migration/16450|title=The Great Kashubian Migration|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their reasons for emigration varied. Until the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Kashubians emigrated primarily for economic reasons. After the Franco-Prussian War and especially due to the [[Kulturkampf]], Kashubian emigration accelerated as socio-political factors came into play. In his 1899 book, ''Statystyka ludnosci kaszubskiej'' (''Statistics of the Kashubian Population''), the Kashubophile linguist and sociologist [[Stefan Ramułt|Stefan Ramult]] estimated that 130,700 Kashubians were living in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Statystyka ludnosci kaszubskiej|last=Ramult|first=Stefan|publisher=Polska Akademia Umiejętności|year=1899|isbn=|location=Krakow|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for emigration==
The primary reason for emigration was economic. Kashubian farmers were not targeted by Prussian laws immediately after 1850. As the eminent Kashubian scholar, Professor [[Józef Borzyszkowski]] of [[Gdańsk University]] has observed, Kashubians were more or less comfortable with Prussian governance at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jozef Borszyskowski, ''The Kashubs, Pomerania and Gdańsk'' (English translation), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, smallholders of all ethnicities were disadvantaged because the greater part of arable Pomeranian land already belonged to estate owners, and what remained was not particularly fertile. Another problem was the population boom among the Kashubians and Poles. Large families were typical of devout Roman Catholics, and in this particular case children were welcomed as additional workers. Once grown to maturity, however, the surfeit of young people were a further drain upon Pomerania's already strained fortunes. Recognizing this situation, the Prussian government tried to free up land by encouraging (but not forcing) Kashubians and Poles to emigrate. One very early incentive was inexpensive or even free travel to North America.&lt;ref&gt;Jan L. Perkowski, "The Kashubs: Origins and Emigration to the U.S.," ''Polish American Studies'', 23.1 (1966), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the Franco-Prussian War and the unification of Germany, Kashubians and Poles met with institutionalized hostility. The Kulturkampf brought further indignities. It became illegal to use the Polish (and by default, the Kashubian) languages in public, including (or especially) church. By this time, too, the first wave of Kashubian emigrants had formed viable communities in towns such as Wilno (Ontario), Winona (Minnesota), and Stevens Point and Pine Creek (Wisconsin). Letters and remittances flowed from the contented North American immigrants, encouraging more Kashubians to try their chances in the West. One particular selling point was the availability of [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]]s. Many emigrated; more, in fact, than the Kashubian immigrant communities could effectively absorb. As the Kashubian community within Germany became more self-aware (thanks to figures such as [[Florian Ceynowa]] and [[Aleksander Majkowski]]) it became more resilient in contending with the Germans; another result of the Kulturkampf was that Kashubians were more likely to make common cause with Poles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12204c.htm Cassubians]&lt;/ref&gt;. The primary sources of the twentieth-century Polish emigration boom were the Austrian and Russian zones of occupation.

==First wave (1855-1870)==
Beginning around 1855, the Kashubian diaspora predated by at least 10 years the onset of the [[Polish American|Polish American diaspora]], which is typically dated to between 1865&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Polish Diaspora|last=Pacyga|first=Dominic|work=Encyclopedia of Diasporas: Immigrant and Refugee Cultures Around the World|publisher=Springer US|year=2004|isbn=978-0-306-48321-9|editor-last=Ember|location=New York City|pages=257|editor-last2=Ember|editor-last3=Skoggard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1870. The first wave of Kashubian emigrants tended to sail from Hamburg to either New York City or Quebec. They emigrated in extended family groups that replicated themselves in North America. [[Portage County, Wisconsin]]'s first Kashubian settlers, the Koziczkowski family, arrived in the fall of 1857.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pchswi.org/archives/polish_heritage/1st_farmers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renfrew County, Ontario]]'s first Kashubian settlers are said to have arrived in 1858.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.kashub.com/canada.html&lt;/ref&gt; The families that settled in Portage County and in Renfrew County quickly established farming settlements: [[Polonia, Wisconsin]] and [[Wilno, Ontario]]. [[Winona, Minnesota]]'s first Kashubian settlers, the Józef Bronk family, are believed to have reached that community in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bambenek.org/winona-2/first-settlement-in-winona-1859/|title=First Settlement in Winona: 1859 – Bambenek.org|website=bambenek.org|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of emigrants that came to Winona had trouble finding farmland in the immediate vicinity; consequently in 1862 the satellite hamlet of Pine Creek was founded about 10 miles away, across the Mississippi River in [[Trempealeau County, Wisconsin]]. The two communities remain closely tied to this day, leading to Winona's status as the "Kashubian capital of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bambenek.org/winona-2/kashubian-capital-of-america/|title=Kashubian Capital of America – Bambenek.org|website=bambenek.org|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Second wave (1870-1900)==
The pace of Kashubian emigration picked up as the [[Kulturkampf]] gathered force. 1872 saw the founding of a small Kashubian community on [[Jones Island, Milwaukee|Jones Island]] in Milwaukee's harbor by Kashubian immigrant Jacob Muza. Unfortunately, the harbor land was too valuable and the Kashubians had never acquired title: the last Kashubian settler was forced out in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-7003-squatting-on-jones-island.html  Sarah Biondich, "Squatting on Jones Island," ExpressMilwaukee.com, 24 June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle 1880s, a Kashubian enclave formed in the Chicago neighborhood of [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]], and the parish of [[St. Josaphat's in Chicago|Saint Josaphat]] was established there in 1884. In 1902, a huge new Romanesque church was completed there. In Winona, the Kashubian community attained such a size that in 1894 the Roman Catholic parish of [[Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka (Winona, Minnesota)|Saint Stanislaus Kostka]] had to level its old sanctuary and build a new one seating 1800 worshipers. Since jobs in Winona's dwindling sawmill industry were in short supply, many of the newer immigrants proceeded west to newer Kashubian settlements in eastern South Dakota, western Minnesota and eastern North Dakota. Toward the turn of the century, minor Kashubian settlements were established in western North Dakota and eastern Montana.

==Location of Kashubians in the Americas, 1899==
Ramult's chapter on Kashubians in the United States was contributed by [[Hieronim Derdowski]], the Kashubian poet and editor of the Polish-American newspaper [[Wiarus]], who broke down America's population of 90,700 Kashubians state by state:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Statystyka ludnosci kaszubskiej|last=Ramult|first=Stefan|publisher=Polska Akademia Umiejętności|year=1899|isbn=|location=Krakow|pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* New York - 7,000 Kashubians, in Buffalo
* Michigan - 5,000 Kashubians, in Detroit
* Minnesota - 6,000 Kashubians, in Winona and some small settlements
* Illinois - 30.000 Kashubians, in Chicago
* South Dakota - 500 Kashubians, in some small settlements
* Massachusetts - 200 Kashubians, in Webster
* Missouri - 1,000 Kashubians, in Saint Louis
* Wisconsin - 30,000 Kashubians, in Milwaukee (20,000) and Portage County (10,000)
* Other states - 10,000 Kashubians living in Pittsburgh, PA and Baltimore, MD
The Kashubian community of Canada, which Ramult estimated at 25,000 people, is centered in Renfrew County, Ontario,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Brazil's Kashubian population, which Ramult estimated at 15,000, is mostly located in the state of [[Paraná (state)|Parana]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Kijik''' is a [[ghost town]] in [[Lake and Peninsula Borough, Alaska|Lake and Peninsula Borough]], [[Alaska]], United States.  An [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabascan]] village that was established on the shores of [[Lake Clark (Alaska)|Lake Clark]] in the [[Alaska Range]], its population was recorded at 91 in the [[1880 United States Census]] and declined thereafter, falling to approximately 25 individuals by 1904.  Today, the village has been abandoned.  The ghost town is located within the bounds of [[Lake Clark National Park and Preserve]].

The historic portion of the village was the subject of archaeological and ethnological research in the 1960s.  Interviews with [[Dena'ina]] elders in [[Nondalton, Alaska|Nondalton]] established that the people of Kijik relocated to Old Nondalton (not far from present-day Nondalton) in the early 19th century, probably to be closer to trading posts and the canneries of [[Bristol Bay]].  A survey expedition that visited the site in 1909 reported it to be abandoned.  A major archaeological excavation of the historic village took place in 1966, exposing twelve foundational remnants of log houses (many of the houses having apparently been moved to Old Nondalton at the time of the relocation), and two of what appeared to be larger communal structures.&lt;ref name=fieldiana&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kijik: An Historic Tanaina Settlement|journal=Fieldiana. Anthropology|issue=Volume 15|date=January 16, 1970|last1=Vanstone|first1=James|last2=Townsend|first2=Joan|pages=1–202|jstor=29782443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, twelve acres of the village site were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]].&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;  A much larger area, encompassing a significant number of archaeological sites related to the habitation and use of the area from at least the 12th century forward, was designated a [[National Historic Landmark District]] in 1994, for the unique concentration of sites related to the inland [[Dena'ina]] people.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/oclp/CLI%20PPG_January2009_small.pdf|title=National Park Service Cultural Landscapes Inventory Professional Procedures Guide|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community was known by many other names than "Kijik" during its history, including "Lake Clark Village", "Nijik", "Nikhkak", "Nikhak", and "Old Keegik".  Its current name has been spelled in a wide variety of ways, including "Keechik", "Keeghik", "Keejik", "Keggik", "Keygik", "Kichak", "Kichik", "Kilchik", and "Kilchikh".

The '''Kosovo [[Myth]]''', or the '''Kosovo [[Cult (religious practice)|Cult]]''' ({{lang-sr|Косовски Завет / Kosovski Zavet}}) is a [[tradition]]al belief of the [[Serbs|Serb people]] asserting that the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (June 1389) symbolizes a martyrdom of the Serbian nation in defense of their honor and [[Christendom]] against [[Turkish people|Turks]] ([[Infidel|non-believers]]). The essence of the myth is that during the battle, Serbs, headed by [[Prince Lazar]], lost because they consciously sacrificed the earthly kingdom ([[Serbian Empire]]) in order to gain the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]].

The legend evolved slowly through chronicles and particularly the oral tradition of Serbs. Since the 19th century period of national revivals in Europe, the Kosovo Myth became an important constitutive element of ethnic identity, as well as cultural and political homogenization of Serbs, and later of members of other South Slavic nations ([[Yugoslavs]]). The basic elements of the Kosovo Myth are vengeance, martyrdom, betrayal and glory. This myth dominated political discourse in Serbia until the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Duijzings2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gerlachlus |last=Duijzings|title=Religion and the Politics of Identity in Kosovo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HPvGOHR2RsC&amp;pg=PA206|date=January 2000|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|isbn=978-1-85065-392-9|page=206|quote=Until recently the Kosovo myth has dominated political discourse in Serbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kosovo myth is incorporated into the Serb national identity's multifaceted [[mythomoteur]].{{sfn|Stoianovich|1994|p=303}}

Since its establishment at the end of the 14th century, the Kosovo Myth and its poetic, literary, religious, and philosophical exposition was intertwined with political and ideological agendas.&lt;ref name="Živković2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Marko |last=Živković|title=Serbian Dreambook: National Imaginary in the Time of Milošević|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fn_F3uZ7DTEC&amp;pg=PA189|year=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-22306-7|page=189|quote=From its very inception the myth of Kosovo and its poetic, literary, religious, and philosophical exegesis was intertwined with political agendas and ideologies....}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mythologization of the battle occurred shortly after the event.&lt;ref name="Wakounig2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milica Cimeša|editor=Marija Wakounig|title=From Collective Memories to Intercultural Exchanges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5e5w8T1DNWwC&amp;pg=PA79|date=28 November 2012|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-90287-0|page=78|quote=... the great amount of mythologization that followed shortly after it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend of Kosovo was not created immediately after the battle but evolved from different originators into various versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenawalt|2001|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kosovo Myth existed in the Serbian oral tradition for centuries, until it was recorded by early collectors like [[Vuk Karadžić]] and evoked at times of later major historic events such as the [[Balkan Wars]], the [[First World War]]&lt;ref name="harvnb|Trgovčević|1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Trgovčević|1996|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Slobodan Milošević]] at the end of the 1980s.{{sfn|Kaufman|2001|p=205}}

== The essence and basic elements of the myth ==
{{See also|Serbian historiography}}

 [[File:Miloš Obilić, by Aleksandar Dobrić, 1861.jpg|thumbnail|180px|right|Miloš Obilić, a hero who sacrificed his life for "the kingdom of heaven" and eternal glory]]

The essence of this myth is the struggle for freedom through the defense of Christianity and the establishment of the free state. Its basic elements are:&lt;ref name="harvnb|Trgovčević|1996"/&gt;
* Vengeance – to restore the Serbian medieval state on the territories where it once existed
* Martyrdom – to sacrifice for freedom and faith
* Betrayal – justifies defeat and warns those who do not support the Serbian cause, such as [[Vuk Branković]]
* Glory – those who sacrifice themselves are promised "the kingdom of heaven" and eternal glory, such as [[Prince Lazar]] and [[Miloš Obilić]]

The Kosovo Myth presents the battle as "a titanic contest between Christian Europe and the Islamic East" in which [[Tsar Lazar]] renounced "the earthly kingdom for a heavenly one".{{sfn|Ramet|2005|p=149}} Although Serbia's strategic fall was the [[Battle of Maritsa]] in 1371, Kosovo was the spiritual fall of Serbia and a beginning of a new era for the [[Serbs]]. The real battle was not as decisive as presented by this myth because the final downfall of medieval Serbia happened 70 years after it, in 1459, when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] captured [[Smederevo]].&lt;ref name="VankovskaWiberg2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Biljana Vankovska|author2=Haken Wiberg|title=Between Past and Future: Civil-Military Relations in Post-Communist Balkan States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygb-6afEakIC&amp;pg=PA227|date=24 October 2003|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-624-9|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kosovo Myth pictures Serbia as ''[[Antemurale Christianitatis]]'' (Bulwark of Christianity), similarly to constructions of the other nations in the Balkans.&lt;ref name="VankovskaWiberg2003"/&gt; It is sometimes propagated to evoke a sense of pride and national grievance among Serbs.{{sfn|Kaufman|2001|p=16}}

== In Serbia ==
The scale of interpretations of the Kosovo Myth is undeniably one of the richest. It can be interpreted as "democratic, anti-feudal, with a love for justice and social equality".{{sfn|Segesten|2009|p=163}} The myth can be interpreted in different ways in connection with other myths like: myth of military valor, myth of victimhood, myth of salvation and myth of chosen people.{{sfn|Segesten|2009|p=101}}

=== Until 19th century ===
Oral epic poetry and folk songs cultivated the Kosovo Myth. Medieval church writers portrayed Prince Lazar as a servant of God whose death was martyrdom for the faith, while Serbs are portrayed as "heavenly people" who defended Christianity against Islam. Military defeat in the Kosovo Battle was portrayed as moral victory.&lt;ref name="SchnabelThakur2000"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Albrecht |last1=Schnabel|first2=Ramesh Chandra |last2=Thakur|title=Kosovo and the Challenge of Humanitarian Intervention: Selective Indignation, Collective Action, and International Citizenship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9VrHQ5ZVacC&amp;pg=PA22|date=1 January 2000|publisher=United Nations University Press|isbn=978-92-808-1050-9|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centrality of the Kosovo Myth was one of the main causes for merging ethnic and Orthodox Christian religious identity of Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Schwandner-Sievers|Fischer|2002|p=60}}: "Unlike, for instance, Serbian nationalism, where ethnic and religious identities have merged (especially through the centrality of the Kosovo myth),..."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Since the 19th century ===
The Kosovo Myth is the central myth of Serbian nationalism used since the 19th century to legitimize the intention of the Serbian nationalistic movement to create an independent national state.&lt;ref name="KaserKatschnig-Fasch2005"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Karl |last1=Kaser|first2=Elisabeth |last2=Katschnig-Fasch|title=Gender and Nation in South Eastern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=km132J3KYFQC&amp;pg=PA95|year=2005|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-8802-2|page=95|quote=The myth of Kosovo is the central national myth of Serbia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kosovo Myth was often used to create a Serbian victimization narrative.{{sfn|Segesten|2009|p=180}} This myth and its connection to the Serbian victim-centered position was used to legitimize reincorporation of Kosovo into Serbia. The Kosovo Myth was activated and linked to the metaphors of 'genocide'. [[Albanians of Kosovo|Albanians from Kosovo]] were accused of genocide (killing and forcible expulsion) of Kosovo Serbs since the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Islamized Albanians were presented as violent and treacherous people who were settled in Kosovo to collaborate with Ottoman occupiers and terrorize Christian Serbs. This centuries-long genocide of Serbs continued in the 19th century through the forcible expulsion of up to 150,000 Serbs, and also in [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s Yugoslavia, 'morally disqualified' Albanians to claim any control of Kosovo at the expense of Serbs.&lt;ref name="Macdonald2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=David Bruce |last=Macdonald|title=Balkan Holocausts?: Serbian and Croatian Victim Centered Propaganda and the War in Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBjrJyen4FEC&amp;pg=PA75|year=2002|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-6467-8|pages=75, 76, 78|quote= &lt;!-- The operationalisation of Kosovo Myth was first used against Kosovar Albanians, as a means of legitimizing the reincorporation of this province into expanded Serbia....anti-Albanian propaganda focused on a long history of Albanian genocide in Kosovo.

There was a deep belief among [[Montenegrins]] that they descended from Serb knights who fled after the battle and settled in the unreachable mountains. The Kosovo Myth was present among the people in [[Montenegro]] before the time of Njegoš, in the form of folk legends and especially folk songs.&lt;ref name="PopovGojković2000"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Olga |last1=Zirojević|first2=Nebojša |last2=Popov|first3=Drinka |last3=Gojković|title=The Road to War in Serbia: Trauma and Catharsis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkBmdCwHuDsC&amp;pg=PA196|date=January 2000|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9116-56-6|page=196|chapter=Kosovo myth (cult) in Montenegro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, with the Yugoslav idea spreading, it also became a trope in common culture of [[Croats]] and [[Slovenes]]. Croatian sculptor [[Ivan Meštrović]] contributed to the Kosovo Myth when in 1907–11, he was commissioned to design the Vidovdan Temple as "the eternal ideal of heroism, loyalty and sacrifice, from which our race draws its faith and moral strength" and "collective ideal of the Serbian people". The temple's actual construction on the [[Battle of Kosovo|Field of Kosovo]] was postponed because of the [[Balkan Wars]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and eventually shelved. [[Mirko Rački]], also adopted the mythos and painted numerous paintings within Kosovo cycle, including ''The Mother of the Jugović'', ''Nine Jugović brothers'', ''[[Kosovo Maiden]]'' and ''Miloš Obilić''.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Trgovčević|1996"/&gt;

Kosovo was particularly present in the public opinion of Great Britain during the First World War where 28 June was proclaimed "Kossovo Day". Manifestations were held across the country. The Kosovo cycle epic folk poems were several times published in France during the war while some French authors emphasized that Kosovo Myth is important to strengthen "the energy for revenge".&lt;ref name="harvnb|Trgovčević|1996"/&gt;

Leading up to the [[Kosovo War]], the contemporary [[Kosovo Albanian]] political mythology clashed with the Kosovo Myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A War of Myths: Creation of the Founding Myth of Kosovo Albanians|journal=Contemporary issues|year=2011|volume=4/1|page=41|author=Vedran Obućina|quote=Contemporary Albanian political mythology is very similar in power, focus and methods to Serbian political mythology about Kosovo. Combined, they make a powerful clash point, a war of the myths which ended in violence and armed conflict. The Albanian myth prevailed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Levi Sandy Alexander Gumby''' (February 1, 1885 – March 16, 1961) was an [[African-American]] archivist and historian. His collection of 300 scrapbooks documenting [[African-American history]] have been part of the collection of [[Columbia University]] since 1950 as the ''Alexander Gumby Collection of Negroiana''. Gumby was also the proprietor of a popular bookstore during the [[Harlem Renaissance]], where he was host of a [[Salon (gathering)|salon]].&lt;ref name='Col02'&gt;{{cite web|title=Black History Remains Alive in Alexander Gumby's Popular Scrapbooks|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/02/02/alexanderGumby.html|author=Jo Kadlecek|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gumby's passion for collecting earned him the nicknames "The Count" and "Mr. Scrapbook".&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt;

==Life==
Born in [[Maryland]], Gumby was the son of an [[Evangelicalism|evangelist]], Levi Thomas Gumby, and his wife, Louisa Morris. He and his sister were sent to live with their grandparents in 1901.&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt; Gumby studied law at Dover State College in Delaware at the behest of his grandmother, but feeling his inadequacy in law he moved to New York City, which would be his home until his death.&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt; Gumby embraced life in New York, saying in his 1952 essay ''The Adventures of My Scrapbook'' that "At once I became a New Yorker in spirit and principle for I found here more freedom of action than I had ever known before".&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt; Six of his scrapbooks are autobiographical, labelled "Gumby's Autobiography".&lt;ref name="Jr.Higginbotham2009"/&gt;

In his early days in New York, Gumby took a number of minor jobs to support his collecting, working as a butler to a banker, a bellhop, and a postal worker during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Jr.Higginbotham2009"/&gt; Gumby also founded the Southern Utopia Fraternity, an organization to support young men who came from the [[Southern United States|Southern States]] to New York in search of work and opportunities.&lt;ref name="Jr.Higginbotham2009"/&gt;

Gumby was forced to abandon his bookshop as a result of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], and was admitted to hospital as a result of the loss of his studio and fatigue, and spent four years in hospitals on [[North Brother Island, East River|North Brother Island]] and [[Randall's Island]] on New York City's [[East River]].&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt;

Working as a waiter at [[Columbia University]], Gumby began fraternizing with academia and students. He would eventually leave his collection to Columbia, and was hired by the university to organize the collection for eight months. He added to it until his death from tuberculosis.&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt;

===Gumby's Book Studio===
In the 1920s Gumby received financial assistance to help compile his collection from Charles W. Newman, a wealthy [[stockbroker]].&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt; With Newman's help Gumby moved his collection to a large studio at 2144 [[Fifth Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Harlem]] district, that became known as "Gumby's Bookstore".&lt;ref name="Jr.Higginbotham2009"/&gt; His book studio became an important gathering place for the figures of the [[Harlem Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Jr.Higginbotham2009"/&gt;

The book studio served as a workspace to compile the collection as well as an exhibition space, and an artistic and intellectual [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]. Due to the imperious nature with which he conducted his salon he was nicknamed "The Great God Gumby". Gumby also produced the ''Gumby Book Studio Quarterly'', a [[literary journal]] that was only published for a single issue, and was never distributed.&lt;ref name="Jr.Higginbotham2009"/&gt;

Through his studio, Gumby became acquainted with such notable Harlem Renaissance figures as [[Countee Cullen]], [[Claude McKay]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Rose McClendon]], Evelyn Ellis, [[Paul Robeson]], [[Alain LeRoy Locke]], Robert Schlick, [[Heywood Broun]], [[H. L. Mencken]], O. Richard Reid, [[Aaron Douglas]], [[Dorothy West]], [[Helene Johnson]], [[Augusta Savage]], [[Richard Bruce Nugent]] and [[Arthur Fauset]].&lt;ref name="Nugent2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Bruce Nugent|title=Gay Rebel of the Harlem Renaissance: Selections from the Work of Richard Bruce Nugent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsgiAryujYgC&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=2 May 2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-8361-1|pages=223–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, Gumby was the only person to keep these documents years after the events occurred. One example is a short series of letters on "Our National Capital," a speech given by Frederick Douglass. The letters were written between Grace Greenwood and Douglass himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Two Letters of Frederick Douglass|jstor = 2715780|journal = The Journal of Negro History|date = 1951-01-01|pages = 80–83|volume = 36|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/2715780|first = Frederick|last = Douglass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=25em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=He was the Great God Gumby - God of his studio, God of all he surveyed, God could do no wrong. He allowed himself the luxury of temperament ... He was a true person and in reality he was the God he called himself|source=—[[Richard Bruce Nugent]] on Gumby at the time of his book studio.&lt;ref name="Nugent2002"/&gt;}}

Charles W. Newman, Gumby's financial backer, was badly affected by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and Gumby's studio lost the support of its regular patrons. The Wall Street Crash forced Gumby to abandon his studio and sell many of his precious editions, and store his scrapbooks in the cellar of a friend's house.&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt;

Gumby was openly [[gay]], and his book studio became a gathering place for the LGBT community in Harlem.&lt;ref name="Jr.Higginbotham2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry Louis Gates, Jr.|author2=Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham|title=Harlem Renaissance Lives: From the African American National Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_vRLcgEdGoC&amp;pg=PA231|accessdate=20 June 2013|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-538795-7|pages=231–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described as a "[[dandy]]" and a "[[wikt:social butterfly|Social Butterfly]]", his style being described by Nugent as "Fancy clothes, a perennial walking stick, pale yellow kid gloves, and a diamond stick-pin made him the [[Beau Brummell]] of his particular little group".&lt;ref name="Nugent2002"/&gt;

==Collection==
In September 1901, aged 16, Gumby made his first scrapbook with clippings concerning the [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassination of President McKinley]].&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt;
Gumby had organized his clippings by 1910, and took his archival work seriously, visiting similar collections in libraries across the United States and Canada. Gumby also became acquainted with fellow African-American archivist, [[Arturo Alfonso Schomburg]].&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt;
Working as a waiter at [[Columbia University]] Gumby began fraternizing with academia and students, adding clippings to his collection about popular professors and Columbia's president, [[Nicholas Murray Butler]].&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt; In 1925 Gumby's collection so crowded his 2½ rooms that he was forced to lease the entire second-floor unpartitioned apartment of the house in which he lived. Gumby initially found it easy to acquire his collection as "Negro" items were considered of little interest to book dealers.

The scrapbooks contain autographed photos, stories and letters from such notable performers as [[Paul Robeson]], [[Josephine Baker]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Count Basie]] and [[Ethel Waters]], and letters and autographs from Black historical figures such as [[Frederick Douglass]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[Booker T. Washington]], [[George Washington Carver]], [[Father Divine]], [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], and [[Marcus Garvey]].

Gumby kept collecting while hospitalized, including articles about his hospitalization, get-well cards and photographs of friends who visited him.&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt; Upon his release from hospital Gumby retrieved and began restoring his collection, and continued to add to them.&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt; In 1950 Gumby donated his collection to [[Columbia University]] and in 1951, Columbia hired him for eight months to help organize the collections.&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt; Gumby continued to add to his scrapbooks until his death from complications from tuberculosis in 1961.&lt;ref name="Jr.Higginbotham2009"/&gt; The 300 scrapbooks are part of Columbia's Rare Book and Manuscript Library in [[Butler Library]] as the ''Alexander Gumby Collection of Negroiana''.&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt;

In the early 1920s he exhibited his collections in cities along the East Coast of America, and was subsequently included in the 1922 edition of the Private Book Collectors' Who's Who.&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt;

Gumby said of his collection that it  "... could well be called 'The Unwritten History ... There are so many surprising and startling historical events pertaining to, or relating to the American Negro that are not recorded in the Standard Histories, dictionaries and school text-books, or if so, they are shaded so that they sound like a Ripley's 'Believe It or Not.'"&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt; A variety of different formats make up the scrapbooks including newspaper stories and magazine articles, and autographs, letters, photos, theatre programmes and documents concerning slavery. The scrapbooks have subsequently been converted to microfilm.&lt;ref name='Col02'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1523">'''Leofric''' (''[[Floruit |fl.]]'' 1070) was an English cleric and writer who wrote an Old English history of [[Hereward the Wake]].

The author of the ''[[Gesta Herewardi]]'' claims that Leofric was Hereward's priest and wrote an account of Hereward's life in [[Old English]]. The ''Gesta''{{'}}s author then used the Old English work as a source for his Latin ''Gesta''. According to the ''Gesta'', Leofric was a priest at [[Bourne, Lincolnshire|Bourne]] while Hereward was active with his rebellion. No version of Leofric's work survives.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;Roffe "Leofric" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of details in the first part of the ''Gesta'', which is where the ''Gesta''{{'}}s author claimed to use Leofric's work, is an argument for the existence of such a work, whether or not it was actually authored by Leofric.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

This is a list of [[bog body|bog bodies]] in order of the country in which they were discovered. Bog bodies, or bog people, are the naturally [[Mummy|preserved corpses]] of humans and some animals recovered from [[peat]] [[bogs]]. The bodies have been most commonly found in the Northern European countries of Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Reports of bog bodies surfaced during the early 1700s.&lt;ref name=Gill-Robinson&gt;{{cite book |last=Gill-Robinson |first=Heather |date=2005 |title=The Iron Age Bog Bodies of the Archäologische Landesmuseum Schloss Gottorf, Schleswig, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the German scientist [[Alfred Dieck]] catalogued more than 1,850 bog bodies, but later scholarship revealed much of Dieck's work was erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van der Sanden |first1=Wijnand |authorlink1=Wijnand van der Sanden |last2=Eisenbess |first2=Sabine |date=2006 |title=Imaginary People |journal=Archäologisches Korrespondenzblatt |issn=0342-734X |volume=36 |number=1 |pages=111–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of bog bodies have been recovered and studied,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lange |first=Karen E. |date=September 2007 |title=Tales From the Bog |journal=National Geographic |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/09/bog-bodies/bog-bodies-text.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is believed that only around 45 bog bodies remain intact today.&lt;ref name=Gill-Robinson_p48&gt;{{cite book |last=Gill-Robinson |first=Heather |date=2005 |title=The Iron Age Bog Bodies of the Archäologische Landesmuseum Schloss Gottorf, Schleswig, Germany |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to use this list ==
* There may be more than one name in the "name" category, which may also be used to show alternate spellings for names of the bog body.
* The location category shows the city or state in which the bog body was discovered, although some bog bodies are discovered on borders between countries.
* The [[Carbon 14]] dating is used to determine an age range based on examination of the [[half lives]] of carbon isotopes.
* The "sex" category describes whether the find was male, female or undetermined.
* The "description" category depicts examination details as well as physical characteristics of the body. Some sections may state ''Little is published about this find'', meaning that there is little or no sufficient information published about the bog body.

| The Arden Woman was found in the Bredmose bog in the Parish of Store Arden, Hindsted, Denmark. Police said the corpse was found in a 'question mark' shape. After the remains were completely unearthed they were moved into a nearby barn. Her hair was dark blond and was drawn into two pigtails and coiled around the top of her head. Over the hair was a bonnet, which was made using a [[sprang]] technique. Unlike some bog bodies, she was found with other garments. She was around the age of 20–25 years old. No signs of violence were found on her body.&lt;ref name="Glob, Peter V 1969"&gt;Glob, Peter V. The Bog People: Iron-Age Man Preserved. Trans. [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]].

| The bog body was lying face down at a depth of two feet on a base of birch bark. Birch branches were also found in the immediate vicinity and, directly on top of the body, were three approximately 10-centimeter-long birch poles of the same thickness. The skull was fractured and the brain was visible. The right leg was broken ten inches below the knee, which was caused by the weight of peat on the body.&lt;ref name="Borremose Examination"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gill-Robinson |first=Heather |date=2005 |title=The Iron Age Bog Bodies of the Archäologische Landesmuseum Schloss Gottorf |pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper body was naked, but the lower body and legs were covered by a cloak made of a four-layered twill fabric and a fringed shawl. These two articles of clothing are now on display at the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in Copenhagen. In addition, there were other objects found with her: half a clay pot, placed on the knees of the corpse, along with half a humerus and half a radius of a human infant beside her. Around the neck of the bog body was a leather belt with an amber bead and a brass disk 22–23 millimeters in diameter.&lt;ref name=Lauber&gt;{{cite book |last=Lauber |first=Patricia G. |date=1985 |title=Tales Mummies Tell |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |isbn=978-0-690-04389-1 |pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Huldremose Woman is the name of the bog body of an Iron Age woman discovered in 1879 near Ramten, [[Jutland]]. The body, found clothed in a wool skirt and two skin capes, dated between 160 BCE and 340 CE.

| The Tollund Man has been noted for the excellent preservation of his facial features. The corpse was found in early May 1950 when a family had been harvesting peat from a bog, near the town of Silkeborg. With the body, a sheepskin cap and a belt were found, although no additional article of clothing was preserved, probably because they had decomposed. He also had a noose around his neck, indicating that he was [[hanged]]. Only his head remains original in his museum display due to lack of preservation knowledge at the time of discovery.

| Because there were very many raspberry seeds found around the stomach area, the body was dubbed "Hallonflickan" (meaning "Raspberry Girl" in English). She was 20–25 years old when she had died. The cause of her death remains a mystery; however, a flint arrowhead was found near to where the body was discovered three years before. She was probably buried in open water, due to the evidence of aquatic snails. The soft tissues of the body had not survived, resulting in skeletonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gejvall |first1=N. G. |last2=Hjortsjö |first2=C. H. |last3=Sahlström |first3=K.

{{nihongo|'''Man'en'''|万延}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号,|''nengō'',| lit. "year name"}} after ''[[Ansei]]'' and before ''[[Bunkyū]]''.  This period spanned the years from March 1860 through February 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Man'en''" {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia,'' p. 607|page=607}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reigning emperor was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Kōmei|Kōmei]]''-tennō''|孝明天皇}}.

==Change of era==
* '''March 18, 1860''' ({{nihongo|''Man'en 1''|万延元年}}): The new era name was created to mark the destruction caused by a fire at Edo Castle and the assassination of [[Ii Naosuke]] (also known as "the disturbance" or "the incident" at the Sakurada-mon).&lt;ref&gt;Satow, Ernest Mason ''et al.'' (1905).

The new era name is derived from an hortatory aphorism to be found in ''[[Book of the Later Han|The Book of the Later Han]]'':  "With 100,000,000,000 descendants, your name will forever be recorded" (豊千億之子孫、歴万載而永延).

'''Parametric determinism''' is a [[Marxist]] interpretation of the course of history. It was formulated by [[Ernest Mandel]] and can be viewed as one variant of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[historical materialism]] or as a [[philosophy of history]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "Die Dialektik von Produktivkraften, Produktionsverhaltenissen und Klassenkampf neben Kategorien der Latenz und des Parametrischen Determinismus in der Materialistischen Geschichtsauffassung". In: ''Die Versteinerten Verhaltenisse zum tanzen Bringen. Beitrage zur Marxistischen Theorie Heute''. Berlin: Dietz Verlag, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article critical of the [[analytical Marxism]] of [[Jon Elster]], Mandel explains the idea as follows:
{{Quotation|Dialectical determinism as opposed to mechanical, or formal-logical determinism, is also parametric determinism; it permits the adherent of [[historical materialism]] to understand the real place of human action in the way the historical process unfolds and the way the outcome of social crises is decided. Men and women indeed make their own history. The outcome of their actions is not mechanically predetermined. Most, if not all, historical crises have several possible outcomes, not innumerable fortuitous or arbitrary ones; that is why we use the expression 'parametric determinism' indicating several possibilities within a given set of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1989/xx/nosense.htm Ernest Mandel, "How To Make No Sense of Marx" (1989) in: ''Analyzing Marxism. New essays on Analytical Marxism'', edited by Robert Ware &amp; Kai Nielsen, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'', Supplementary Volume 15, 1989, The University of Calgary Press, pp. 105–132.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Formal rationality and dialectical reason==

In formal-logical determinism, human action is considered ''either'' rational, and hence logically explicable, ''or else'' arbitrary and random (in which case human actions can be comprehended at best only as patterns of statistical distributions, i.e. as degrees of variability relative to some constants). But in dialectical determinism, human action may be ''non-arbitrary'' and ''determinate'', hence reasonable, even although it is ''not'' explicable exclusively in terms of deductive inference. The action selected by people from a limited range of options may not be the "most logical" or "most optimal" one, but it can be shown to be ''non-arbitrary'' and ''reasonable'' under the circumstances, if the total context is considered.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe van Parijs, ''Evolutionary explanation in the social sciences: an emerging paradigm.'' Totown (New Jersey): Rowman and Littlefield, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

What this means is that, in human situations, typically ''several "logics" are operating at the same time'' which together determine the outcomes of those situations:

*the logic of the actors themselves, in their consciousness and actions.
*the logic of the given parameters constraining their behaviour.
*the logic of the interactive (reflexive) relationship between actors and their situation.

If one considered only one of these aspects, one might judge people's actions "irrational", but if all three aspects are taken into account, what people do may appear "very reasonable". [[Dialectical]] theory aims to demonstrate this, by linking different "logical levels" together as a total picture, in a non-arbitrary way. "Different logical levels" means that particular determinants regarded as irrelevant at one level of analysis are excluded, but are relevant and included at another level of analysis with a somewhat different (or enlarged) set of assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "Partially independent variables and internal logic in classical Marxist economic analysis’", in ''Social Science Information'', vol. 24 no. 3 (1985), pp. 487–88 (reprinted in Ulf Himmelstrand, ''Interfaces in Economic &amp; Social Analysis'', London 1992).[gesd.free.fr/mandel85.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;—depending on the kind of problem being investigated.

For example, faced with a situation, the language which people use to talk about it, reveals that they can jump very quickly from one context to another related context, knowing very well that at least some of the inferences that can be drawn in the one context are not operative in the other context. That's because they know that the assumptions in one context differ to some degree from the other. Nevertheless, the two contexts can  coexist, and can be contained in the same situation, which we can demonstrate by identifying the mediating links. This is difficult to formalize precisely, yet people do it all the time, and think it perfectly "reasonable". For another example, people will say "you can only understand this if you are in the situation yourself" or "on the ground." What they mean is that the meaning of the totality of interacting factors involved can only be understood by experiencing them. Standing outside the situation, things seem irrational, but being there, they appear very reasonable.

Dialectical theory does not mean that, in analyzing the complexity of human action, inconvenient facts are simply and arbitrarily set aside. It means, rather, that those facets of the subjectmatter which are not ''logically required'' at a given stage of the analysis are set aside. Yet, and this is the point, as the analysis progresses, the previously disregarded aspects are integrated step by step into the analysis, in a consistent way. The proof of the validity of the procedure is that, at the end, the theory has made the subjectmatter fully self-explanatory, since all salient aspects have been given their appropriate place in the theory, so that all of it becomes comprehensible, without resort to shallow tautologies.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, ''Late Capitalism''. London: NLB, 1975, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This result can obviously be achieved only after the research has already been done, and the findings can be arranged in a convincing way. A synthesis cannot be achieved without a preceding analysis. So dialectical analysis is not a "philosopher's stone" that provides a quick short-cut to the "fount of wisdom", but a mode of presenting findings of the analysis after knowledge has been obtained through inquiry and research, and dialectical relationships have been verified. Because only then does it become clear where the story should begin and end, so that all facets are truly explained. According to Ernest Mandel, "Marx's method is much richer than the procedures of ' successive concretization' or 'approximation' typical of academic science."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, ''Late Capitalism''. London: NLB, 1975, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mainstream social theory, the problem of "several logics" in human action is dealt with by [[game theory]], a kind of modelling which specifies the choices and options which actors have within a defined setting, and what the effects are of their decisions. The main limitation of that approach is, that the model is only as good as the assumptions on which it is based, while the choice of assumptions is often eclectic or fairly arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Shaun P. Hargreaves-Heap and Yanis Varoufakis, ''Game theory. A critical introduction.'' (2nd ed.). London: Routledge, 2004. Steve Keen, "My Friend Yanis, The Greek Minister Of Finance." ''Forbes'', 31 january 2015.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevekeen/2015/01/31/my-friend-yanis-the-greek-minister-of-finance/]&lt;/ref&gt; Dialectical theory attempts to overcome this problem, by paying attention to the sources of assumptions, and by integrating the assumptions in a consistent way.

==Making history==

One common problem in [[history|historical analysis]] is to understand to what extent the results of human actions can be attributed to free choices and decisions people made (or [[free will]]), and to what extent they are a product of social or natural forces beyond their control.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Sherman, "Marx and determinism". ''Journal of Economic Issues'', Vol. 15 No. 1, 1981, pp. 61–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

To solve this problem theoretically, Mandel suggests that in almost any human situation, some factors ("[[parameter]]s") are beyond the control of individuals, while some other conditions are under their control (arguably, one group of people could "impose parameters" on another, analogous to parents imposing constraints on children). Some things can under the circumstances be changed by human action, according to [[choice]], but others cannot or will not be, and can thus be regarded as constants. A variable can vary, yet it cannot vary in any direction whatever but only within the given parameters. In a general sense, a "parameter" is a given condition imposed on a situation, or a controlled variable, but more specifically it refers to a condition which, in some way, ''limits the amount and type of variability there can be''.

Those given, objective parameters which are beyond people's control (and thus cannot normally be changed by them) ''limit'' the realm of possibilities in the future; they ''rule out'' some conceivable future developments or alternatively make them ''more likely to happen''. In that sense human action is "determined" and "determinate". If that wasn't so, then it would be impossible to predict anything much about human behaviour.

Some of these parameters refer to limits imposed by the physical world, others to limits imposed by the social set-up or [[social structure]] that individuals and groups operate within. The dominant [[ideology]] or [[religion]] could also be a given parameter. If for example most people follow a certain faith, this shapes their whole cultural life, and is something to be reckoned with that isn't easily changed.

At the same time, however, the given parameters cannot usually determine ''in total'' what an individual or group will do, because they have at least some (and sometimes a great deal) of personal or behavioural autonomy. They can think about their situation, and make some free choices and decisions about what they will do, within the framework of what is objectively possible for them (the choices need not be ''rational'' or ''fully conscious'' ones, they could just be ''non-arbitrary'' choices influenced by emotions and desires). Sentient (self-aware) organisms, of which human beings are the most evolved sort, are able to vary their own response to given situations according to internally evaluated and decided options.

In this sense, [[Karl Marx]] had written:

{{Quotation|"People make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm Karl Marx, ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'', Part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"The past" (what really happened before, as distinct from its results in the present) is not something which can be changed at all in the present, only reinterpreted, and therefore the past is a given constant which delimits what can possibly happen in the present and in the future. If the future seems relatively "open-ended" that is just because in the time-interval between now and the future, new options and actions could significantly alter what exactly the future will be. Yet the variability of possible outcomes in the future is not infinite, but delimited by what happened before.

==Ten implications==
Ten implications of this view are as follows:
*At any point in time, the outcomes of an historical process are partly predetermined, and partly uncertain because they depend on what human choices and decisions will be made in the present. Those choices are not made in a vacuum, but in an environment which makes those choices possible, makes them meaningful and gives them effect. Otherwise they would not be real choices, only imaginary choices.
*While the past and the present rule out some courses of action, a human choice is always possible between a finite number of realistic options, which often enables the experienced analyst to specify the "most likely scenarios" of what could happen in the future. Some things cannot happen, and some things are more likely to happen than others.
*Once an important choice has been made and acted upon, this will have an effect on the realm of possibilities; in particular, it will shift to a greater or lesser extent the parameters delimiting what can happen in the future. Thus, once "a train of events has been set in motion", it will foreclose other possibilities, and also it might open up some new ones. If masses of people make important new choices, whether in response to circumstances or in response to a new idea, a ''qualitative change'' occurs; in that case, most people begin to behave differently.
*The process of history is both determined, in that the given parameters delimit the possible outcomes, but also open-ended, insofar as human action (or inaction) can change the historical outcomes within certain limits. Human history-making is therefore a reciprocal interaction between what people do, and the given circumstances.
*To some extent at least, it is possible to predict with useful accuracy what will happen in the future, if one has sufficient experience, knowledge, and insight into the relevant causal factors at work as well as how they are related. This may be a work of science or sustained practical experience. In turn, future perspectives can importantly influence human action in the present.
*In historical analysis and portrayals, the analytical challenge is to understand what part of a course of events is attributable to conscious human actions and decisions, what part is shaped by the combination of given circumstances in which the human actors had to act, and what exactly is the relationship between them (the link between the "part" and the "whole").
*Because the ability to prove historical assessments scientifically is limited, [[ideology]], a [[mind-set]] or a social [[mentality]] about the state of the world typically plays an important role in the perspectives people develop (Mandel refers here to an idea by [[Lucien Goldmann]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "The role of the individual in history: the case of world war two", in: ''New Left Review'' I-157, May–June 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; With hindsight, it may be possible to trace out accurately why events necessarily developed in the way that they did, and not otherwise. But at the time they are happening, this is usually not, or not completely possible, and the [[hope]] (or [[fear]]) for a particular future may play an important role (here Mandel refers to the philosophy of [[Ernst Bloch]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, " Anticipation and Hope as Categories of Historical Materialism", in: ''Historical materialism'', Volume 10, Number 4 / December, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ideology influences whether one looks upon past events as ''failures'' or ''successes'' (as many historians have noted, history is often rewritten by the victors in great historical battles to cast themselves in an especially positive light). There is no "non-partisan" history-writing in this sense, at best we can say the historian had full regard for the known facts pertaining to the given case and frankly acknowledges his biases.
*"History" in general cannot be simply defined as "the past", because it is also "the past living in the present" and "the future living in the present". Historical thinking is not just concerned with what past events led to the present, but also with those elements from the past which are contained in the present and elements that point to the future. It involves both antecedents and consequents, including future effects. Only on that basis can we define how people can "make history" as a conscious [[Praxis (process)|praxis]].
*The main reason for studying history is not because we{{Who|date=April 2017}} should assign praise or blame, or simply because it is interesting, but because we need to study past experience ''to understand the present and the future''. History can be seen as a "laboratory", the lab-record of which shows how, under given conditions, people tried to achieve their goals, and what the results of their experimentations were. This can provide insight into what is likely or unlikely to succeed in future. At the very least, each generation has to come to grips with the experience of the previous generation, as well as educating the future generation.
*The theory of [[historicism]] according to which the historical process as a whole has an overall purpose or [[teleology]] (or "grand design") is rejected. With [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], Mandel thought that "'History does nothing... It is people, real, living people who do all that... “history” is not, as it were, a person apart, using people as a means to achieve its own aims; history is nothing but the activity of people pursuing their aims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch06_2.htm#history|title=The Holy Family by Marx and Engels|first=Karl|last=Marx|date=|work=Marxists.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of course, with the proviso that people did so within given parameters not of their own making, allowing us to identify broad historical movements as determinate processes. The historical process is also not a matter of linear progress according to inevitable stages—both progress and regress can occur, and different historical outcomes are possible depending on what people do.

==Perceptions and illusions==
According to the theory of parametric determinism, the "human problem" in this context is usually not that human beings lack free choice or free will, or that they cannot in principle change their situation (at least to some extent), but rather is their ''awareness'' of the options open to them, and their ''belief'' in their own ability to act on them—influenced as they may be, by their ideology, experience and emotions.

Perceptions of what people can change or act upon may vary a great deal, they might overestimate it, or underestimate it. Thus it may take [[science|scientific inquiry]] to find out what perceptions are realistic. By discovering what the determinism is, we can learn better how we can be free. Simply put, we could "bang our head against a wall", but we could also go over the wall, through a door in the wall, or around the wall. At crucial points, humans can "make history" actively with a high awareness of what they are doing, changing the course of history, but they can also "be made by history" to the extent that they passively conform to (or are forced to conform to) a situation which is mostly not of their own making and which they may not understand.

As regards the latter, Mandel referred to the condition of [[Social alienation|alienation]] in the sense of a diminished belief in the ability to have control over one's own life, or feeling estranged from one's real nature and purpose in life.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "The Marxist theory of alienation", in: ''International Socialist Review'', Vol. 3, No. 31, 1970, pp.19-23, 49-50.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/19xx/xx/alien.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; People might [[reification (Marxism)|reify]] aspects of their situation. They might regard something as inevitable ("God's will") or judge "nothing could be done to prevent it" when the real point is that, for specific reasons, nobody was prepared to do anything about it—something could have been done, but it wasn't. Thus "historical inevitability" can also be twisted into a convenient apology to justify a course of events.

In this process of making choices within a given objective framework of realistic options, plenty of illusions are also possible, insofar as humans may have all kinds of gradations of (maybe false) awareness about their true situation. They may, as Mandel argues, not even be fully aware of what motivates their own actions, quite aside from not knowing fully what the consequences of their actions will be. A revolutionary seeking to overthrow the old order to make way for a new one obviously faces many "unknowns".

Therefore, human action can have ''[[unintended consequence]]s'', including effects which are completely opposite to what was intended.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz D. Kurz, "Das Problem der nichtintendierten Konsequenzen; Zur Politischen Ökonomie von Karl Marx". ''Marx-Engels Jahrbuch'' 2012-13, Internationale Marx-Engels-Stiftung, Berlin: Akademie Verlag GmbH, 2013, pp. 75–122.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that popular illusions can also shape the outcomes of historical events. If most people believe something to be the case, even although it is not true, this fact can also become a parameter limiting what can happen or influencing what will happen.

==Skeptical reply==

Because terrible illusions can occur, some historians are [[skepticism|skeptical]] about the ability of people to change the world for the better in any real and lasting way. [[Postmodernism]] casts doubt on the existence of progress in history as such—if e.g. Egyptians built the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in 2500&amp;nbsp;BC, and [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[Neil Armstrong]] landed on the [[moon]] in 1969, this represents no progress for humanity.

However, Mandel argued that this skepticism is itself based on perceptions of what people are able to know about their situation and their history. Ultimately, the skeptic believes that it is impossible for people to have sufficient knowledge of a kind that they can really change the human condition for the better, except perhaps in very small ways. It just is what it is. This skeptical view does not necessarily imply a very "deterministic" view of history however; history could also be viewed as an unpredictable [[wikt:Chaos|chaos]] or too complex to fathom.

However, most [[politician]]s and [[political activism|political activists]] (including Mandel himself) at least do not believe that history generally is an unpredictable chaos, because in that case their own standpoints would be purely arbitrary and be ''perceived'' as purely arbitrary. Usually, they would argue, the chaos is limited in space and time, because in perpetual chaos, human life can hardly continue anyway; in that case, people become reactive beasts. Since people mostly do want to [[wiktionary:survival|survive]], they need some order and predictability. One can understand what really happened in history reasonably well, if one tries. Human beings can understand human experience because they are human, and the more relevant experience they obtain, the better they can understand it.

Conscious human action, Mandel argues, is mainly non-arbitrary and practical, it has a certain "logic" to it even if people are not (yet) fully aware of this. The reality they face is ''ordered'' in basic ways, and therefore can be meaningfully understood. Masses of people might go into a "mad frenzy" sometimes that might be difficult to explain in rational terms, but this is the exception, not the rule. What is true is that a situation of chaos and disorder (when nothing in society seems to work properly anymore) can powerfully accentuate the irrational and non-rational aspects of human behaviour. In such situations, people with very unreasonable ideas can rise to power. This is, according to Mandel, part of the explanation of [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, Introduction to Leon Trotsky, ''The Struggle Against Fascism in Germany'', Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, 1971, pp. 9–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical latency and the possibilities for change==

The concept of parametric determinism has as its corollary the concept of ''historical latency''. It is not just that different historical outcomes are possible, but that each epoch of human history contains quite a few different developmental ''potentials''. The indications of these potentials can be empirically identified, and are not simply a speculation about "what could conceivably happen".

But they are ''latent'' factors in the situation, insofar as they will not necessarily be realised or actualised. Their realisation depends on human action, on the recognition of the potential that is there, and the decision to do something about it. Thus, Mandel argues that both [[socialism]] and [[barbarian|barbarism]] exist as broad "latent" developmental possibilities within modern capitalist society, even if they are not realised, and whether and which of these will be realised, depends on human choices and human actions.

Effective action to change society, he argues, has to set out from the real possibilities there are for an alternative way of doing things, not from abstract speculations about a better world. Some things are realistically possible, but not just "anything" is possible. The analytical challenge—often very difficult—is therefore to understand correctly what the real possibilities are, and which course of action would have the most fruitful effect. One can do only what one is able to do and no more, but much depends on choices about how to spend one's energies.

Typically in [[war]]s and [[revolution]]s, when people exert themselves to the maximum and have to improvise, it is discovered that people can accomplish far more than they previously thought they could do (also captured in the saying "necessity is the mother of invention"). The whole way people think is suddenly changed. But in times of [[cultural pessimism]], general exhaustion prevails and people are generally skeptical or cynical about their ability to achieve or change very much at all. If the bourgeoisie beats down the workers and constrains their freedom, so that workers have to work more and harder for less and less pay, pessimistic moods can prevail for quite some time. If, on the other hand, the bourgeois economy is expanding, the mood of society can become euphoric, and people believe that just about anything is possible. A famous leftwing slogan in [[May 1968]] was "tout est possible" ("anything is possible"). Similarly, in the boom of the later 1990s, many people in rich countries believed that all human problems could finally be resolved.

That is just to say that what is possible to achieve can be both pessimistically underestimated and optimistically exaggerated at any time. Truly conservative people will emphasize how little potential there is for change, while rebels, visionaries, progressives and revolutionaries will emphasize how much could be changed. An important role for [[social science|social scientific inquiry]] and [[historiography]] is therefore to relativise all this, and place it in a more objective perspective by looking at the relevant facts.

==Criticisms==

While Mandel himself made some successful predictions about the future of world society (for instance, he is famous for predicting at the beginning of the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "The economics of neocapitalism". ''The Socialist Register 1964''. London: Merlin Press, 1964, pp. 56-67.[http://www.socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/download/5928/2824]&lt;/ref&gt; like [[Milton Friedman]] did, that the [[postwar economic boom]] would end at the close of the decade), his [[Trotskyist]] critics (including his biographer Jan Willem Stutje) argue, with the benefit of hindsight, that he was far too optimistic and hopeful about the possibility of a workers' revolution in [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] era and after—and more generally, that his historical optimism distorted his political perspectives, so that he became too "certain" about a future that he could not be so certain about, or else crucially [[ambivalence|ambivalent]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Willem Stutje, ''Ernest Mandel: a rebel's dream deferred''. London: Verso, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is arguably a rather shallow criticism insofar as the situation could well have developed in different directions, which is precisely what Mandel himself argued;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, introduction to ''Beyond Perestroika: The Future of Gorbachev's USSR''. London: Verso, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; in politics, one could only try to make the most of the situation at the time, and here pessimism was not conducive to action. But the more substantive criticism is that many of Mandel's future scenarios were simply not realistic, and that in reality things turned out rather differently from what he thought. This raises several questions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert K. |last=Merton |title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |volume=1 |issue=6 |year=1936 |pages=894–904 [pp. 895–896] |jstor=2084615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*whether the theory of parametric determinism in history is faulty
*whether Mandel's ''application'' of the theory in his analyses was faulty
*how much we can really foresee anyway, and what distinguishes forecast from prophecy.
*whether and how much people learn from history anyway.

In answering these criticisms, Mandel himself would probably have referred to what he often called the "laboratory of history". That is, we can check the historical record, to see who predicted what, the grounds given for the prediction, and the results. On that basis, we can verify empirically what kind of thinking (and what kind of people) will produce the most accurate predictions, and what we can really predict with "usable accuracy". One reason why he favoured [[Marxism]] was because he believed it provided the best intellectual tools for predicting the future of society. He often cited [[Leon Trotsky]] as an example of a good Marxist able to predict the future. Trotsky wrote in 1925 that:

{{Quotation|"The essence of Marxism consists in this, that it approaches society concretely, as a subject for objective research, and analyzes human history as one would a colossal laboratory record. Marxism appraises ideology as a subordinate integral element of the material social structure. Marxism examines the class structure of society as a historically conditioned form of the development of the productive forces; Marxism deduces from the productive forces of society the inter-relations between human society and surrounding nature, and these, in turn are determined at each historical stage by man’s technology, his instruments and weapons, his capacities and methods for struggle with nature. Precisely this objective approach '''arms Marxism with the insuperable power of historical foresight'''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Trotsky]], “Dialectical Materialism and Science” (1925). ''New International'' (New York), Vol.6 No.1, February 1940, pp.24-31.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1925/09/science.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This may all seem a trivial "academic" or "scholastic" debate, similar to retrospective speculations about "what could have been different", but it has very important implications for the [[socialist]] idea of a [[planned economy]]. Obviously, if it is not possible to predict much about human behaviour with usable accuracy, then not much economic planning is feasible either—since a plan requires at least some expectation that its result ''can and will be realised in the future'', even if the plan is regularly adjusted for new (and unanticipated) circumstances. In general, Mandel believed that the degree of predictability in human life was very much dependent on the way society itself was organised. If e.g. many producers competed with each other for profits and markets, based on privatized knowledge and business secrets, there was much unpredictability in what would happen. If the producers coordinated their efforts co-operatively, much would be predictable.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "In Defence of Socialist Planning", ''New Left Review'' I/159, September–October 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

A deeper problem, to which Mandel alludes with his book ''Trotsky: A study in the dynamic of his thought'', is that ''if'' we regard certain conditions as possible to change for the better, we ''might'' be able to change them, even if currently people believe it is impossible—whereas if we regard them as unchangeable, we are unlikely to change them at all, even although they could possibly be changed ( a similar insight occurs in [[pragmatism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, ''Trotsky: A study in the dynamic of his thought''. London: NLB, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, we make things possible, by doing something about them rather than do nothing. This, however, implies that even when we try our best to be objective and realistic about history or anything else, we remain subjects influenced by ''subjective perceptions'' or elements of [[fear]], [[hope]], [[Will (philosophy)|will]] or [[faith]] that defy reason or practicality.

It is, simply put, very ''difficult'' to bring scientific truths and political action together, as Marxists aim to do, in such a way that we really change the things we can change for the better to the maximum, and do not try to change things we really cannot change anyway (Marxists call this "the unity of theory and practice"). In other words, the will to change things can involve subjective perceptions of a kind for which even the best historical knowledge may offer no assistance or guide. And all perceptions of "history-making" may inescapably involve [[ideology]], thus—according to skeptics—casting some doubt on the very ability of people to distinguish objectively between what can be changed, and what cannot. The boundary between the two might be rather blurry. This is the basis of [[Karl Popper]]'s famous philosophy of social change by "small steps" only.

Mandel's reply to this skepticism essentially was to agree that there were always "unknowns" or "fuzzy" areas in human experience; for people to accomplish anything at all or "make their own history", required taking a [[risk]], calculated or otherwise. One could indeed see one's life as a "wager" ultimately staked on a belief, scientifically grounded or otherwise. However, he argued it was one thing to realise all that, but another to say that the "unknowns" are "unknowable". Thus, for good or for ill, "you don't know, what you haven't tried" and more specifically "you don't know, what you haven't tried to obtain knowledge about". The limits of [[knowledge]] and human possibilities could not be fixed in advance by [[philosophy]]; they had to be ''discovered'' through the test of practice. This attitude recalls [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s famous comment that "All social life is essentially ''practical''. All mysteries which lead theory to [[mysticism]] find their rational solution in human practice, and in the comprehension of this practice.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm|title=Theses On Feuerbach by Karl Marx|first=Karl|last=Marx|date=|work=Marxists.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mandel believed, with Marx, that "[[ignorance]] never helped anybody" except those who profited from its existence ("never underestimate human [[gullibility]], including your own").

The general task of revolutionary science was to overcome ignorance about human life, and this could not very well be done by [[wiktionary:reconciliation|reconciling]] people with their allegedly "predetermined" [[destiny|fate]] at every opportunity. We all know we will die eventually, but that says little yet about what we can achieve before that point. Skepticism has its uses, but what those uses are, can only be verified from experience; a universal skepticism would be just as ''arbitrary'' as the belief that "anything is possible"—it did not lead to any new experience from which something could be learnt, including learning about the possibilities of human [[Freedom of will|freedom]]. And such [[learning]] could only occur through making conscious [[choices]] and [[Decision making|decisions]] within given parameters, i.e. in a ''non-arbitrary'' (non-chaotic) environment, permitting at least some [[predictability]] and allowing definite experiential conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/19xx/marx-hist/index.htm Ernest Mandel, ''The Place of Marxism in history'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandel often reiterated that most people do not learn all that much from texts or from history, they learn from their own experience. They might be affected by history without knowing it. But anybody concerned with large-scale [[social change]] was almost automatically confronted with the need to place matters in broader historical perspective. One had to understand deeply the limits, consequences and implications of human action. Likewise, politicians making decisions affecting large numbers of people could hardly do without a profound sense of history.

'''Pedra da Gávea''' is a [[monolith]]ic [[mountain]] in [[Tijuca Forest]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. Composed of [[granite]] and [[gneiss]], its elevation is {{convert|844|m}}, making it one of the highest mountains in the world that ends directly in the ocean.&lt;ref name="CPRM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cprm.gov.br/geoecoturismo/pedra_gavea/excursaovirtual.html|title=Pedra da Gávea|first1=Antonio Ivo|last1=de Menezes Medina|first2=Edgar|last2=Shinzato|publisher=Geological Survey of Brazil (Companhia de Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais)|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trails on the mountain were opened up by the local farming population in the early 1800s; today, the site is under the administration of the [[Tijuca National Park]].&lt;ref name=sumorg&gt;{{cite web|title=Pedra da Gávea|url=http://www.summitpost.org/pedra-da-g-vea/150534#_/term_|publisher=SummitPost.org|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain's name translates as ''Rock of the Topsail'', and was given to it during the expedition of Captain [[Gaspar de Lemos]], begun in 1501, and in which the Rio de Janeiro bay (today [[Guanabara Bay]], but after which the city was named) also received its name. The mountain, one of the first in Brazil to be named in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], was named by the expedition's sailors, who compared its silhouette to that of the shape of a [[topsail]] of a [[carrack]] upon sighting it on January 1, 1502. That name in turn came to be given to the [[Gávea]] area of the city of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montanhasdorio.com.br/principal_destaque.cfm?contador=11|title=Pedra da Gávea e a mística Cabeça do Imperador|language=Portuguese|year=2004|publisher=montanhasdorio.com.br|work=Montanhas do Rio|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differential weathering on one side of the rock has created what is described as a stylized human face. Markings on another face of the rock have been [[Archaeological interest of Pedra da Gávea|described as an inscription]]. Geologists and scientists are nearly in agreement that the "inscription" is the result of erosion and that the "face" is a product of [[pareidolia]]. Furthermore, the consensus of archaeologists and scholars in Brazil is that the mountain should not be viewed as an archaeological site.

The contact zone between the upper granite and the lower gneiss is both sub-horizontal and semi-gradual, and the gneissic [[xenolith]]s have a tabular form, which heavily suggests that they were captured from a [[magma chamber]]’s floor by thermal detachment. It has been suggested that Pedra da Gávea "correspond[s] to the bottom of a granitic magma chamber and the original thickness of the granitic body was much larger than the present exposure."&lt;ref name=motoki/&gt; The granitic body of the Pedra da Gávea could also correspond to the eastern extension of the nearby Pedra Branca Granite Massif, according to Akihisa Motoki et al.&lt;ref name=motoki&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Motoki|first1=Akihisa|title=Contato Intrusivo na Base do Corpo Granítico da Pedra da Gávea, Parque Nacional da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro|date=2005|page=1|url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/motoki5.tripod.com/Ign/19_Unesp_Gavea_12.doc|accessdate=July 31, 2014|publisher=[[Sociedade Brasileira de Geologia]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological interest ==
{{main|Archaeological interest of Pedra da Gávea}}
There is a purported inscription carved into the rockface, which some claim is in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], a [[Semitic language]] known to modern scholars only from inscriptions. According to Paul Herrmann in his book ''Conquests by Man'', the inscription on the mountain had been known for quite some time, but had merely been attributed to "some unknown prehistoric American people".&lt;ref name=her212 /&gt; Closer examination, however, led some researchers to believe it was of Phoenician origin.&lt;ref name=her212&gt;[[#Herrmann|Herrmann (1954)]], p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, however, most researchers suggest that the inscription and "face" are merely the results of erosion.&lt;ref name=thejournal /&gt;&lt;ref name="portugesebook"/&gt;&lt;ref name=travelguide&gt;[[#Waggoner|Waggoner (2008)]], pp. 1–650.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950s, the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Health denied that the site featured any writing, declaring "that examination by geologists had proved it to be nothing more than the effect of weather erosion which happened to look like an inscription."&lt;ref name=her214&gt;[[#Herrmann|Herrmann (1954)]], p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian archaeologists and scholars have adopted a negative attitude toward the treatment of the site, with Herrmann noting that "Brazilian archaeology denies altogether the existence of Phoenician inscription in any part of the country whatsoever."&lt;ref name=her214 /&gt;

'''Phum Snay''' ({{lang-km| ភូមិ ស្នាយ}}) is an [[Iron Age]] archaeological site discovered in May 2000 in Preah Neat Prey District, [[Banteay Meanchey Province]], Northwest [[Cambodia]], around {{convert|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the temple ruins of [[Angkor]]. The site was excavated between 2001 and 2003 by primary excavators Dougald O’Reilly of the [[Australian National University]], Pheng Sitha and Thuy Chanthourn. The excavation was intended to discover more about Iron Age life in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/phum-snay-ruined-other-sites-danger | title = Phum Snay ruined, other sites in danger | publisher =  The Phnom Penh Post | date=April 25, 2003 |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The site was discovered in 2000 during roadworks, that linked Phum Snay village with National Road 6. Investigations revealed the presence of a number of ancient burials associated with material including bronzes and semiprecious stones. Immediate widespread looting by the local inhabitants over an area of {{convert|24|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} made a full assessment of the extent of the archaeological remains difficult. Excavations started in February 2001 on a 15 x 5 m area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/460955/Excavations_at_Phum_Snay_Cambodia | title = A Preliminary Report on the Excavation of a Late Prehistoric Cemetery in NorthwestCambodia | publisher =  Academia | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
The site dates roughly between 500 BC and AD 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hl-128-171-57-22.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/17251/1/AP-v45n2-189-211.pdf | title = Archaeology and Archaeozoology of Phum Snay: A late Prehistoric cemetery in Northwestern Cambodia | publisher = ScholarSpace | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/ccaa/en/talk22.htm | title = Prehistoric Culture of Cambodia and Its Relationship towards South China - all the findings can be placed in frame of VII century BC - V century AD, though I think, that the majority of the finds belong to the beginning of AD era | publisher = The Chinese University of Hong Kong | date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These dates were not obtained from [[stratigraphy]] as many of the artifacts and burials were disturbed by [[looting]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxenham, M., &amp; Tayles, N. (Eds.). (2006). Bioarchaeology of Southeast Asia (Vol. 43). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronology was therefore determined by comparison to other nearby sites with similar grave goods and mortuary rituals.

== Human remains ==
A general analysis was done of the 134 individuals identified through the [[Minimum number of individuals|minimum number of individuals method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/269337416_fig7_Figure-7-Archaeological-evidence-of-warfare-and-weaponry-at-Phum-Snay-a-adult-male | title = Figure 7. Archaeological evidence of warfare and weaponry at Phum Snay - The minimum number of individuals (MNI) was 134: 124 adults and 10 sub-adults | publisher = research gate | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-one burials in total were exhumed that contained human remains. The researchers noted pathological lesions in photos and written descriptions. A few specimens were x-rayed but the images yielded limited results. The majority of the injuries listed were cranial lesions. These were categorized into two groups: those caused by sharp force trauma (henceforth referred to SFT) which left small focused circles or lines and those caused by [[blunt force trauma]] (BFT,) resulting in round depressions in the scalp. SFT lesions are generally caused by sharp edged weapons, such as knives, swords and axes. Projectiles, such as arrows or those used by a slingshot should also be considered as SFT objects or items. BFT lesions result from clubs, cudgels and hammers. Perimortem injuries were identified as separate from healed injuries because they often had bone flakes adhered to the edges of the fractures. Researchers were careful to distinguish between lesions caused by violence and those caused by infectious disease.

== Results ==

===Traumatic lesions===

Out of the sample discovered at Phum Snay, 23.4% of the individuals showed signs of traumatic lesions, a number that is much higher than any other site in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="domett"&gt;Domett, K. M., O'Reilly, D. J. W., &amp; Buckley, H. R. (2011). Bioarchaeological evidence for conflict in Iron Age north-west Cambodia. Antiquity, 85(328).&lt;/ref&gt;  Both BFT and SFT were present within the skeletal remains, but there was a much higher rate of healed lesions than perimortem lesions.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Some individuals had more than one lesion present upon the cranium.  Within a sample of fifteen individuals, seventeen BFT lesions could be seen.  These BFT lesions were rounded in shape, ranging in diameter from roughly 4 to 22&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Estimations suggest that injuries acquired by the individuals at the site were much higher than the remains can represent because a majority of assaults probably caused soft-tissue injuries, which would not be preserved in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;

===Burials===

Within the Phum Snay site, two types of burials were found.  These include bodies that were stretched out lying flat and pits where remains were simply in piles.&lt;ref name="lapteff"&gt;Lapteff, S. V. (2013). Early Iron Age Burial Practices of the Ancient Khmer People: The Phum Snay Necropolis, Northwestern Cambodia. Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia, 41(2), 137-145.&lt;/ref&gt;  The burials contained a variety of grave goods, including ceramic vessels, bronze ornaments (bangles, rings, and bells), and a large quantity of animal bones.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, D. J., von den Driesch, A., &amp; Voeun, V. (2006). Archaeology and archaeozoology of Phum Snay: a late prehistoric cemetery in northwestern Cambodia. Asian Perspectives, 45(2), 188-211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glover, I., &amp; Bellwood, P. S. (Eds.). (2004). Southeast Asia: from prehistory to history. New York: RoutledgeCurzon.&lt;/ref&gt;  The proportion of left forelimbs of hooved animals suggest a very particular sacrificial practice of animals within the burials.  Researchers found that the manner of the burials and the goods contained within were closest in relation to the [[Óc Eo]] culture of the [[Mekong Delta]].&lt;ref name="lapteff" /&gt;

===Weapons===

Another major find within Phum Snay was the high percentage of burials containing weapons.  The graves contained swords, daggers, spearheads, and projectile points.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Due to the context of burials with high rates of traumatic lesions, the presence of these weapons indicates possible military formation, and certainly an increased level of violence than is seen in other sites within Southeast Asia.  The weapons and tools found within the site were made of iron with bronze adornments.&lt;ref name="lapteff" /&gt;  This solidified the site's place within the Iron Age because iron weapons and tools had many advantages over bronze, such as the high abundance of iron within the Earth, which made the spread of iron very rapid.&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer, B. A. (2007). Dictionary of artifacts. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;  Also present in the burials of a number of young adult males were [[epaulette|ornamental shoulder decorations]], which further support the idea of a violence-oriented society.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  The lack of blunt objects within the burials is slightly puzzling due to the higher rate of BFT lesions than SFT lesions, but this could be explained if the individuals at Phum Snay wore helmets for protection.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;

===Health===

The health of the people living at Phum Snay was also determined from the burials.  Rates of [[attrition (dental)|attrition]], caries, and abscesses in the teeth of the human remains gave an idea of their dietary habits.  The main result from the dentition was the presence of a social structure regarding male and female roles within the community.  Rates of [[dental caries]] in females were higher than the males, which may be attributed to a sexual division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;Domett, K. M., &amp; O'Reilly, D. J. W. (2009). Health in Pre-Angkorian Cambodia: a bioarchaeological analysis of the skeletal remains from Phum Snay. Asian Perspectives, 48(1), 56-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the men are out hunting, they are receiving a higher level of protein in the food they are consuming, while the females may be eating more cariogenic foods if they are back tending the fields and surrounded by [[starches]] and [[carbohydrates]].

===Morphological comparisons===

Measurements were taken on the cranial and dental morphologies of the individuals found within Phum Snay to compare them with those of modern [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], and [[Laos]].&lt;ref name="mats"&gt;Matsumura, H., Domett, K. M., &amp; O'REILLY, D. J. (2011). [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/119/1/119_100511/_article On the origin of pre-Angkorian peoples: perspectives from cranial and dental affinity of the human remains from Iron Age Phum Snay, Cambodia]. Anthropological Science, 119(1), 67-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The morphological similarities were found from Q-mode correlation coefficients of cranial and dental metrics.&lt;ref name="mats" /&gt;  The findings indicated that the morphology of individuals at Phum Snay were significantly different than any of the other groups being compared.  Overall, the modern groups have less robusticity than is found in the Phum Snay morphologies.&lt;ref name="mats" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/pre-angkor-warrior-women-found-expert-says-61781/ | title = Pre-Angkor Warrior Women Found, Expert Says | publisher = The Cambodia Daily | date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological significance ==

The high rates of traumatic lesions and weapons within the burials at Phum Snay suggest a society that values warriors.  Fighting was an important part of life to the people, which could be indicative of increasing competition over access to exotic exchange items during the Iron Age.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Furthering this idea is the general location of Phum Snay, right outside the Angkorian capital.  Increasing competition over resources could have been the driving force behind the formation of a hierarchical society and organized state.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;
The differences in morphological features between the human remains at Phum Snay and other modern Southeast Asian areas lends itself to the two-layer hypothesis.  The people at Phum Snay were less affected by the substantial [[gene flow]] received by other areas of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="mats" /&gt;

==History of Popol Vuh==

===Father Ximénez's manuscript===
In 1701, Father Ximénez came to Santo Tomás [[Chichicastenango]] (also known as Santo Tomás Chuilá). This town was in the Quiché territory and therefore is probably where Fr. Ximénez first redacted the mythistory.&lt;ref&gt;See Tedlock's definition and usage of this term.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ximénez's title page reads in part, "cvra doctrinero por el real patronato del pveblo de Sto. Tomas Chvila" ('doctrinal priest of the district of Santo Tomás Chuilá').&lt;/ref&gt; Ximénez transcribed and translated the manuscript in parallel K'iche' and Spanish columns (the K'iche' having been represented phonetically with Latin and Parra characters). In or around 1714, Ximénez incorporated the Spanish content in book one, chapters 2–21 of his ''Historia de la provincia de San Vicente de Chiapa y Guatemala de la orden de predicadores''. Ximénez's manuscripts remained posthumously in the possession of the Dominican Order until General [[Francisco Morazán]] expelled the clerics from [[Guatemala]] in 1829–30 whereupon the Order's documents passed largely to the [[Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala|Universidad de San Carlos]].

From 1852 to 1855, [[Moritz Wagner]] and [[Carl Scherzer]] traveled to Central America, arriving in Guatemala City in early May 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Scherzer found Ximénez's writings in the university library, noting that there was one particular item "del mayor interes" ('of the greatest interest'). With assistance from the Guatemalan historian and archivist [[Juan Gavarrete]], Scherzer copied (or had a copy made) of the Spanish content from the last half of the manuscript, which he published upon his return to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Scherzer also published a detailed inventory of the contents in 1857 edition that coincides with the Ayer ms. Scherzer's copyscript and edition began at the third internal title: 1) ''Arte de las tres lengvas Kakchiqvel, Qvíche y Zvtvhil'', 2) ''Tratado segvndo de todo lo qve deve saber vn mínístro para la buena admínístraçíon de estos natvrales'', 3) ''Empiezan las historias del origen de los indíos de esta provinçia de Gvatemala'', 4) ''Escolíos a las hístorías de el orígen de los indios'' [note: spelling is that of Ximénez, but capitalization is modified here for stylistic reasons].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, French Abbot [[Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]] also found Ximénez's writings in the university library. However, whereas Scherzer copied the manuscript, Brasseur apparently stole the university's volume and took it back to France.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff 2009 pp. 46–47. Brasseur mentions Ximénez's Popol Vuh manuscript in three different works from 1857–1871, but never explicitly states the library document as the source of 1861 French edition. See ''Histoire des nations civilisées du Mexique et de l'Amérique-Centrale'' (1857), ''Popol vuh. Le livre sacré'' (1861), and ''Bibliothèque Mexico-Guatémalienne'' (1871). It was not until fifteen years after his return to Europe that Brasseur suggested a specific provenance of his source material and then asserted that it had come from Ignacio Coloche in Rabinal. The inconsistency among his statements led Munro Edmonson (1971) to postulate that there had been multiple manuscripts in Guatemala.&lt;/ref&gt; After Brasseur's death in 1874, the Mexico-Guatémalienne collection containing Popol Vuh passed to [[Alphonse Pinart]] through whom it was sold to [[Edward E. Ayer]]. In 1897, Ayer decided to donate his 17,000 pieces to [[Newberry Library|The Newberry Library]], a project that tarried until 1911. Father Ximénez's transcription-translation of "Popol Vuh" was among Ayer's donated items.

Father Ximénez's manuscript sank into obscurity until Adrián Recinos (re)discovered it at The Newberry in 1941. Generally speaking, Recinos receives credit for finding the manuscript and publishing the first direct edition since Scherzer. But Munro Edmonson and Carlos López attribute the first (re)discovery to Walter Lehmann in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson 1971 p. viii; Lopez 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Allen Christenson, Néstor Quiroa, Rosa Helena Chinchilla Mazariegos, John Woodruff, and Carlos López all consider the Newberry's volume to be Ximénez's one and only "original."

===Father Ximénez's source===

It is generally believed that Ximénez borrowed a phonetic manuscript from a parishioner for his source, although Néstor Quiroa points out that "such a manuscript has never been found, and thus Ximenez's work represents the only source for scholarly studies."&lt;ref&gt;Quiroa, "Ideology" 282)&lt;/ref&gt; This document would have been a phonetic rendering of an oral recitation performed in or around [[Santa Cruz del Quiché]] shortly following Pedro de Alvarado's 1524 conquest. By comparing the genealogy at the end of Popol Vuh with dated colonial records, Adrián Recinos and [[Dennis Tedlock]] suggest a date between 1554 and 1558.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 30–31 (1947); Goetz 22–23 (1950); Tedlock 56 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; But to the extent that the text speaks of a "written" document, Woodruff cautions that "critics appear to have taken the text of the first folio recto too much at face value in drawing conclusions about Popol Vuh's survival."&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff, "Ma(r)king Popol Vuh" 104&lt;/ref&gt; If there was an early post-conquest document, one theory (first proposed by Rudolf Schuller) ascribes the phonetic authorship to Diego Reynoso, one of the signatories of the ''[[Título de Totonicapán]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 34; Goetz 27; see also Akkeren 2003 and Tedlock 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible author could have been Don Cristóbal Velasco, who, also in ''Titulo de Totonicapán'', is listed as "Nim Chokoh Cavec" ('Great Steward of the Kaweq').&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;After the list of rulers, the narrative recounts that the three Great Stewards of the principal ruling K'iche' lineages were "the mothers of the word, and the fathers of the word"; and the "word" has been interpreted by some to mean the Popol Vuh itself.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Since a prominent place is given to the Kaweq lineage at the end of Popol Vuh, the author / scribe / narrator / storyteller may have belonged to this lineage as opposed to another K'iche' lineage.&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, the colonial presence is clear in Popol Vuh's preamble: "This we shall write now under the Law of God and Christianity; we shall bring it to light because now the Popol Vuh, as it is called, cannot be seen any more, in which was clearly seen the coming from the other side of the sea and the narration of our obscurity, and our life was clearly seen."&lt;ref&gt;Goetz 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the need to "preserve" the content presupposes an imminent disappearance of the content, and therefore, Edmonson theorized a pre-conquest glyphic codex. No evidence of such a codex has yet been found.

A minority, however, disputes the existence of pre-Ximénez texts on the same basis that is used to argue their existence. Both positions are based on two statements by Ximénez. The first of these comes from ''Historia de la provincia'' where Ximénez writes that he found various texts during his curacy of Santo Tomás Chichicastenango that were guarded with such secrecy "that not even a trace of it was revealed among the elder ministers" although "almost all of them have it memorized."&lt;ref&gt;"y así determiné el trasuntar de verbo ad verbum todas sus historias como las traduje en nuestra lengua castellana de la lengua quiché, en que las hallé escritas desde el tiempo de la conquista, que entonces (como allí dicen), las redujeron de su modo de escribir al nuestro; pero fue con todo sigilo que conservó entre ellos con tanto secreto, que ni memoria se hacía entre los ministros antiguos de tal cosa, e indagando yo aqueste punto, estando en el curato de Santo Tomás Chichicastenango, hallé que era la doctrina que primero mamaban con la leche y que todos ellos casi lo tienen de memoria y descubrí que de aquestos libros tenían muchos entre sí [...]" (Ximenez 1999 p. 73; English translation by WP contributor)&lt;/ref&gt; The second passage used to argue pre-Ximénez texts comes from Ximénez's addendum to "Popol Vuh." There he states that many of the natives' practices can be "seen in a book that they have, something like a prophecy, from the beginning of their [pre-Christian] days, where they have all the months and signs corresponding to each day, one of which I have in my possession."&lt;ref&gt;"Y esto lo ven en un libro que tienen como pronostico desde el tiempo de su gentilidad, donde tienen todos los meses y signos correspondientes á cada dia, que uno de ellos tengo en mi poder" (Scherzer 1857; English translation by WP contributor). This passage is found in ''Escolios a las historias'' as appearing on p. 160 of Scherzer's edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Scherzer explains in a footnote that what Ximénez is referencing "is only a secret calendar" and that he himself had "found this rustic calendar previously in various indigenous towns in the Guatemalan highlands" during his travels with Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;"El libro que el padre Ximenez menciona, no es mas que una formula cabalistica, segun la cual los adivinos engañadores pretendían pronosticar y explicar ciertos eventos. Yo encontré este calendario gentilico ya en diversos pueblos de indios en los altos de Guatemala."&lt;/ref&gt; This presents a contradiction because the item which Ximénez has in his possession is not Popol Vuh, and a carefully guarded item is not likely to have been easily available to Ximénez. Apart from this, Woodruff surmises that because "Ximenez never discloses his source, instead inviting readers to infer what they wish [...], it is plausible that there was no such alphabetic redaction among the Indians. The implied alternative is that he or another missionary made the first written text from an oral recitation."&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué in Popul Vuh==
[[File:Hero Twins.JPG|225px|thumb|Tonsured Maize God and Spotted Hero Twin]]
Many versions of the [[legend]] of the [[Maya Hero Twins|Hero Twins]] Hunahpú and Xbalanqué circulated through the Mayan peoples{{cn|date=November 2017}}, but the story that survives was preserved by the Dominican priest [[Francisco Ximénez]]&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; who translated the document between 1700 and 1715.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Popol Vuh Newberry|url=http://www.newberry.org/popol-vuh|website=www.newberry.org|publisher=The Newberry|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maya deities in the [[Post-classical_history|Post-Classic]] codices differ from the earlier versions described in the [[Mesoamerican_chronology|Early Classic]] period. In Mayan mythology Hunahpú and Xbalanqué are the second pair of twins out of three, preceded by [[Hun_Hunahpu|Hun-Hunahpú]] and his brother Vucub-Hunahpú, and precursors to the third pair of twins, [[Howler_monkey_gods|Hun Batz and Hun Chuen]]. In the Popol Vuh, the first set of twins, Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hanahpú were invited to the Mayan Underworld, [[Xibalba]], to play a ballgame with the Xibalban lords. In the Underworld the twins faced many trials filled with trickery; eventually they fail and are put to death. The Hero Twins, Hunahpú and Xblanaqué, are magically conceived after the death of their father, Hun-Hunahpú, and in time they return to Xibalba to avenge the deaths of their father and uncle by defeating the Lords of the Underworld.

==Structure==
Popol Vuh encompasses a range of subjects that includes creation, ancestry, history, and cosmology. There are no content divisions in the Newberry Library's holograph, but popular editions have adopted the organization imposed by [[Brasseur de Bourbourg]] in 1861 in order to facilitate comparative studies.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos explains: "The original manuscript is not divided into parts or chapters; the text runs without interruption from the beginning until the end. In this translation I have followed the Brasseur de Bourbourg division into four parts, and each part into chapters, because the arrangement seems logical and conforms to the meaning and subject matter of the work. Since the version of the French Abbe is the best known, this will facilitate the work of those readers who may wish to make a comparative study of the various translations of the Popol Vuh" (Goetz xiv; Recinos 11–12; Brasseur, Popol Vuh, xv)&lt;/ref&gt; Though some variation has been tested by Tedlock and Christenson, editions typically take the following form:
[[File:Popol Wuj's deity.png|450px|thumb|A family tree of gods and demigods.&lt;br/&gt;Vertical lines indicate descent&lt;br/&gt;Horizontal lines indicate siblings&lt;br/&gt;Double lines indicate marriage]]

==Popol Vuh today==

===Modern editions===
Since Brasseur's and Scherzer's first editions, the Popol Vuh has been translated into many other languages besides its original K'iche'.&lt;ref&gt;Schultze Jena 1944&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish edition by [[Adrián Recinos]] is still a major reference, as is Recino's English translation by Delia Goetz. Other English translations&lt;ref&gt;Low 1992&lt;/ref&gt; include those of Victor Montejo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=97|edition=|pages=|year=2000|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=GP Subscription Publications|volume=|quote=|location=|title=MultiCultural Review, Volume 9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p23aAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mayan+girls+chinese&amp;dq=mayan+girls+chinese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hOehVZnBOIeNNty5gfgM&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCDge|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munro Edmonson (1985), and Dennis Tedlock (1985, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=|edition=|pages=|year=2013|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=eBookIt.com|author=Dennis Tedlock|volume=|quote=|location=|title=Popol Vuh: The Mayan Book of the Dawn of Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoI24A65-m4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mayan+girls+chinese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hOehVZnBOIeNNty5gfgM&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBDge#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=1456613030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tedlock's version is notable because it builds on commentary and interpretation by a modern K'iche' [[daykeeper]], [[Andrés Xiloj]]. Augustín Estrada Monroy published a facsimile edition in the 1970s and Ohio State University has a digital version and transcription online. Modern translations and transcriptions of the K'iche' text have been published by, among others, [[Luis Enrique Sam Colop|Sam Colop]] (1999) and [[Allen J. Christenson]] (2004). The tale of Hunahpu and Xbalanque has also been rendered as an hour-long animated film by [[Patricia Amlin]]&lt;ref name="OCLC number 56772917"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amlin|first1=Patricia|title=Popol vuh|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/popol-vuh/oclc/56772917|website=WorldCat|accessdate=27 November 2017|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Popol Vuh|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIAzWOqo1fY|website=YouTube|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary culture===
The Popol Vuh continues to be an important part in the belief system of many K'iche'.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Although Catholicism is generally seen as the dominant religion, some believe that many natives practice a syncretic blend of Christian and indigenous beliefs.  Some stories from the ''Popol Vuh'' continued to be told by modern Maya as folk [[Maya legends|legends]]; some stories recorded by [[anthropologist]]s in the 20th century may preserve portions of the ancient tales in greater detail than the Ximénez manuscript.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} On August 22, 2012, the Popol Vuh was declared ''intangible cultural heritage'' of [[Guatemala]] by the Guatemalan Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publinews.gt/index.php/popol-vuh-es-declarado-patrimonio-cultural-intangible/|title=Popol Vuh es declarado Patrimonio Cultural Intangible|first=|last=Publinews|date=25 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflections in Western culture===
Since its rediscovery by Europeans in the 19th century, the Popol Vuh has attracted the attention of many authors. For example, the myths and legends included in [[Louis L'Amour]]'s novel ''[[The Haunted Mesa]]'' are largely based on the Popol Vuh.  The planet of Camazotz in Madeleine L'Engle's ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]'' is named for the bat-god of the hero-twins story. The text was also used by [[german people|German]] film director [[Werner Herzog]] as extensive narration for the first chapter of his movie ''[[Fata Morgana (1971 film)|Fata Morgana]]'' (released 1971). Mexican painter [[Diego Rivera]] did a series of watercolors in 1931 as illustrations for the book.

In 1934, the Franco-American early avant-garde composer [[Edgard Varèse]] wrote his ''Ecuatorial'', a setting of words from the Popol Vuh for bass soloist and various instruments. The Argentinian composer [[Alberto Ginastera]] began writing his opus 44 symphonic work ''[[Popol Vuh (Ginastera)|Popol Vuh]]'' in 1975 but left the work incomplete at his death in 1983.

In Munich, Germany in 1969, keyboardist [[Florian Fricke]]—at the time ensconced in Mayan myth—formed a band named [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]] with synth player Frank Fiedler and percussionist Holger Trulzsch. Their 1970 debut album, ''[[Affenstunde]]'', reflected this spiritual connection. The band is notable especially for its extremely early experimentation with forms that became popularized through the modern electronic, new age/ambient music that was to follow years later. They also collaborated with [[Werner Herzog]] on five of his movies. Another band by the same name, this one of Norwegian descent, formed around the same time, its name also inspired by the K'iche' writings.

==Antecedents in Maya iconography==

Contemporary archaeologists (first of all [[Michael D. Coe]]) have found depictions of characters and episodes from Popol Vuh on [[Maya_ceramics|Mayan ceramics]] and other art objects (e.g., the [[Hero Twins]], [[Howler Monkey Gods]], the shooting of [[Vucub-Caquix]] and, as many believe, the restoration of the Twins' dead father, [[Hun Hunahpu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying sections of hieroglyphical text could thus, theoretically, relate to passages from the ''Popol Vuh''. [[Richard D. Hansen]] found a stucco frieze depicting two floating figures that appear to be the [[Hero Twins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.authenticmaya.com/authentic_maya.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213215620/http://www.authenticmaya.com/authentic_maya.htm |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/international/2009/10/14/wus.mirador.bk.c.cnn|title=Video News|date=October 14, 2009|publisher=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2009/11/01/baldwin.mirador.forgotten.may.cnn|title=Video News|date=November 11, 2009|publisher=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/empty|title=Breaking News, Latest News and Videos|publisher=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the site of [[El Mirador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/El-Mirador-the-Lost-City-of-the-Maya.html?c=y&amp;page=7|title=El Mirador, the Lost City of the Maya|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Twin Hero narrative, mankind is fashioned from white and yellow corn, demonstrating the crop's transcendent importance in Maya culture. To the Maya of the Classic period, [[Hun Hunahpu]] may have represented the maize god; his severed head became a calabash, or, as some believe, a cacao pod or an ear of corn. In this line, decapitation and sacrifice correspond to harvesting corn and the sacrifices accompanying planting and harvesting.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Irene McKillop, The Ancient Maya: New Perspectives (London: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2006), 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Planting and harvesting also relate to Maya astronomy and calendar, since the cycles of the moon and sun determined the crop seasons.&lt;ref&gt;McKillop, 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''post–Cold War era''' is the period in [[world history]] from the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] on  9:00 am, December 26, 1991 to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cddrl.stanford.edu/publications/a_tale_of_two_worlds_core_and_periphery_in_the_postcold_war_era |title=A Tale of Two Worlds: Core and Periphery in the Post-Cold War Era - CDDRL |publisher=Cddrl.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was criticized for its ambiguity: "Even though it has been ten years since the [[Berlin Wall]] came down," wrote [[Paul Wolfowitz]] in 2000, "we still have no better name for the period in which we live than the ''post-Cold War era''." The name means that this new era “does not yet have a name.”&lt;ref&gt;"Remembering the Future," ''National Interest'', 59, (2000): p 35.&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that ''[[Pax Americana]]'' or "[[clash of civilisations]]" would more reflect the reality of the era but the former term would be "offending for many."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[William Wohlforth]], "The Stability of a Unipolar World," ''International Security'', 24/1, (1999): p 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The same dilemma expressed [[Condoleezza Rice]]: “That we do not know how to think about what follows the US-Soviet confrontation is clear from the continued references to the "post-Cold War period.'"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Condoleezza Rice, “Promoting the National Interest,” ''Foreign Affairs'', 79/1, (January/February 2000): p 45.&lt;/ref&gt; "We knew better where we had been than where we were going.”&lt;ref&gt;)Condoleezza Rice, “Rethinking the National Interest,” ''Foreign Affairs'', 87/4, (July/August 2008), http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080701faessay87401/condoleezza-rice&lt;/ref&gt;

It has mostly been dominated by the rise of [[globalization]] (as well as [[nationalism]] and [[populism]] in reaction) enabled by the commercialization of the [[Internet]] and the growth of the [[mobile phone]] system. The ideology of [[postmodernism]] and [[cultural relativism]] has according to some scholars replaced [[modernism]] and notions of absolute progress and ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1077292/postmodernism |title=postmodernism (philosophy) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period has seen the [[United States]] become by far the most powerful country in the world and the rise of [[China]] from a relatively weak [[developing country]] to a fledgling [[potential superpower]]. Reacting on the rise of China, the United States has strategically sought to "rebalance" the Asia-Pacific region. It has also seen the [[European Union|merging of most of Europe into one economy]] and a shift of power from the [[G7]] to the larger [[G20]]. Accompanying the [[NATO]] expansion, Ballistic Missile Defenses ([[Ballistic Missile Defense|BMD]]) were installed in East Europe. These marked important steps in the [[military globalization]].

[[Environmentalism]] has also become a mainstream concern in the post-Cold War era following the circulation of widely accepted evidence for human activity's effects on Earth's climate. The same heightened consciousness is true of [[terrorism]], owing largely to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States and their global fallout.

==Background==
During most of the latter half of the 20th century, the two most powerful states in the world were the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and the [[United States]] (US). These two federations were called the world's [[superpower]]s.&lt;ref name="redruth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johndclare.net/cold_war1_redruth.htm |title=Cold War Revision |publisher=Johndclare.net |date=2008-11-21 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with the threat of growing Japanese, German and Italian [[fascism]] and a world war, the western Allies and the Soviet Union made an [[Allies of World War II|alliance]] of necessity during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="redruth" /&gt;

The alliance between the US and USSR was simply against a greater common enemy and the two countries never really trusted each other. After the Axis was defeated, these two powers became highly suspicious of each other because of their vastly different ideologies.

This struggle, known as the [[Cold War]], lasted from about 1947 to 1991, beginning with the second [[Red Scare]] and ending with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. Prominent Historian of the Cold War, [[John Lewis Gaddis]], wrote at the dawn of the post-Cold War era that the characteristics of the new era are not yet certain but it is certain that it will be very different from the Cold War era and it means that a turning point of world historical significance took place:
{{quote|
The new world of the post-Cold War era is likely to have few, if any, of these [Cold War] characteristics: that is an indication of how much things have already changed since the Cold War ended. We are at one of those rare points of 'punctuation' in history at which old patterns of stability have broken up and new ones have not yet emerged to take their place. Historians will certainly regard the years 1989–1991 as a turning point comparable in importance to the years 1789–1794, or 1917–1918, or 1945–1947; precisely what has 'turned,' however, is much less certain. We know that a series of geopolitical earthquakes has taken place, but it is not yet clear how these upheavals have rearranged the landscape that lies before us.&lt;ref&gt;"The Cold War, the Long Peace, and the Future," ''Diplomatic History'', 16/2, (1992): p 235.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Consequences of the Fall of Communism==
The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] caused profound changes in nearly every society in the world. Much of the policy and infrastructure of the [[Western world|West]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]] had revolved around the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Communism|communist]] ideologies respectively and the possibility of a [[nuclear warfare]].

===Government, economic and military institutions===
The fall of Communism formed an existential threat for many institutions. The [[United States Armed Forces|US military]] was forced to cut much of its expenditure, though the level rose again to comparable heights after the [[September 11 attacks]] and the initiation of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shah |first=Anup |url=http://www.globalissues.org/article/75/world-military-spending |title=World Military Spending — Global Issues |publisher=Globalissues.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Cold War also coincided with the end of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]. Declining Cold War tensions in the later years of the 1980s meant that the apartheid regime was no longer supported by the West as a [[Anti-communism|bulwark against Communism]] and they were condemned with an [[embargo]]. In 1990, [[Nelson Mandela]] was freed from prison and the regime made steps to end apartheid, which were on an official basis completed by 1994 with the [[South African general election, 1994|new election]].

[[Socialism|Socialist]] parties around the world saw drops in membership after the [[Berlin Wall]] fell and the public felt that [[free market]] ideology had won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/keyword/Left_and_radical/SWP/15967/14-01-2013/collapse-of-stalinism-and-the-1990s |title=Left and radical :: SWP |publisher=Socialist Party |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]], [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]],&lt;ref name="frontline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cuny/laptop/coldwar.html|title=The Lost American - Post-Cold War &amp;#124; FRONTLINE|date=|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nationalism|nationalist]] &lt;ref name="frontline" /&gt; and [[Islamism|Islamist]] &lt;ref name="frontline" /&gt; parties on the other hand benefited from the fall of the Soviet Union. As capitalism had "won", as people saw it, socialism in general declined in popularity. Social-Democratic [[Scandinavia]]n countries [[Privatization|privatized]] many of their commons in the 1990s and a political debate on modern institutions re-opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_rlI_S59dMC&amp;pg=PA356|title=The Age of Social Democracy: Norway and Sweden in the Twentieth Century|author=Francis Sejersted|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011|isbn=0-691-14774-4|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scandinavian nations are now more seen as [[Social democracy|social democrat]] (see [[Nordic model]]).

The United States, having become the only global superpower, was also able to use this ideological victory to reinforce its leadership position in the new world order. It was claimed that, “the United States and its allies are on the right side of history”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The US also became the most dominant influence over the newly connecting global economy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GADDIS|first=JOHN LEWIS|date=April 1992|title=The Cold War, the Long Peace, and the Future|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7709.1992.tb00499.x|journal=Diplomatic History|volume=16|issue=2|pages=234–246|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.1992.tb00499.x|issn=0145-2096}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this unipolar international system was in tension with the emerging potential for a multipolar world as India, China, and Japan developed to a point where they might challenge US hegemony.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This created new potential for worldwide conflict, ending the balance, from mutually assured destruction in the case of nuclear war, which had held the world in a state of “long peace” throughout the Cold War.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The [[China|People's Republic of China]], already having [[Chinese economic reform|moved towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s]] and facing public anger after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] in Beijing, moved even more quickly towards free market economics in the 1990s. [[McDonald's]] and [[Pizza Hut]] both entered the country in the second half of 1990, the first American chains in China aside from [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]] which had entered 3 years earlier in 1987. Stock markets were established in [[Shenzhen]] and [[Shanghai]] late in 1990 as well. The restrictions on car ownership were loosened in the early 1990s, causing the bicycle to decline as a form of transport by 2000.

The move to capitalism has increased the economic prosperity of China, but many people still live in poor conditions, working for companies for very small pay and in dangerous and poor conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57571591/apples-chinese-suppliers-still-exploiting-workers-says-report/ |title=Apple's Chinese suppliers still exploiting workers, says report |publisher=CBS News |date=2013-02-27 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the Cold War, Communism would also end in [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], [[People's Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[Yugoslavia]],
[[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], and [[People's Republic of Angola|Angola]], today there are only five remaining Communist countries in the world.

Many other third world countries who had seen involvement from the United States and/or the Soviet Union were also able to resolve political conflicts with the removal of the ideological interests of these superpowers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruland|first=Jurgen|date=2016-07-22|title=U.S. Foreign Policy Toward the Third World: A Post-cold War Assessment|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315497495|doi=10.4324/9781315497495}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the apparent victory of democracy and capitalism in the Cold War, many more countries adapted these systems, which also allowed them access to the benefits of global trade, as economic power became more prominent than military power in the international arena.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, as the United States maintained global power, its role in many [[United States involvement in regime change#1973%3A%20Chile|Regime Changes]] during the Cold War went mostly officially unacknowledged, even when some, such as El Salvador and Argentina, resulted in extensive human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/time-for-a-us-apology-to-el-salvador/|title=Time for a US Apology to El Salvador {{!}} The Nation|last=Bonner|first=Raymond|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Technology===
The end of the [[Cold War]] allowed many technologies that were formerly off limits to the public to be [[Declassification|declassified]]. The most important of these was the [[Internet]], which was created as [[ARPANET]] by the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] as a system to keep in touch following an impending nuclear war. The last restrictions on commercial enterprise online were lifted in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cameron Chapman |url=http://sixrevisions.com/resources/the-history-of-the-internet-in-a-nutshell/ |title=The History of the Internet in a Nutshell |publisher=Sixrevisions.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the approximately two decades since, the Internet's population and usefulness grew immensely. Only about 20 million people (less than 0.5 percent of the world's population at the time) were online in 1995, mostly in the US and several other Western countries. By the mid-2010s, more than one third of the world's population was online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2011.pdf |title=One third of the world's population is online : 45% of Internet users below the age of 25 |publisher=Itu.int |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1674">[[Friar|Fray]] '''Prudencio de Sandoval''' (1553&amp;ndash;1620) was a Spanish historian and [[Benedictine]] monk, the [[Bishop of Tuy]] from 1608 to 1612 and [[Bishop of Pamplona]] thereafter until his death.

De Sandoval was born in [[Valladolid]].  He continued the chronicle begun by [[Florián de Ocampo]] and [[Ambrosio de Morales]], and rather uncritically compiled a large collection of documents, making much use of Guevara y Mejía. His ''Historia de la vida y hechos del emperador Carlos V'' is a source of fundamental importance for the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. His ''Historia de los reyes de Castilla y León'' or ''Historia de los cinco reyes'' (Pamplona: 1615) includes some documentary and epigraphic material now lost. He died in [[Pamplona]], and his last work, ''Crónica del ínclito emperador de España don Alonso VII'' (1660), was published posthumously.

'''Shock and awe''' (technically known as '''rapid dominance''')  is a tactic based on the use of [[overwhelming power]] and spectacular [[show of force|displays of force]] to paralyze the enemy's perception of the battlefield and destroy its will to fight.&lt;ref name="oxfordref"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100502693 |title=Shock and awe – Overview|accessdate=May 18, 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite book |last=Knowles |first=Elizabeth |year=2006 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable |isbn=978-0-19-860981-0 |location=Oxford, United Kingdom |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the concept has a variety of historical precedent, the doctrine was explained by [[Harlan K. Ullman]] and [[James P. Wade]] in 1996 and was developed specifically for application by the US military by the [[National Defense University]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordref" /&gt;

==Doctrine of rapid dominance==
Rapid dominance is defined by its authors, Harlan K. Ullman and James P. Wade, as attempting

{{quote|to affect the will, perception, and understanding of the adversary to fight or respond to our strategic policy ends through imposing a regime of Shock and Awe.&lt;ref name="rddef"&gt;Harlan K. Ullman and James P. Wade, &lt;cite&gt;[http://www.dodccrp.org/files/Ullman_Shock.pdf Shock And Awe: Achieving Rapid Dominance]&lt;cite&gt; (National Defense University, 1996), XXIV.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Further, rapid dominance will, according to Ullman and Wade,

{{quote|impose this overwhelming level of Shock and Awe against an adversary on an immediate or sufficiently timely basis to paralyze its will to carry on ... [to] seize control of the environment and paralyze or so overload an adversary's perceptions and understanding of events that the enemy would be incapable of resistance at the tactical and strategic levels.&lt;ref name="rddef2"&gt;Ullman and Wade, &lt;cite&gt;Shock and Awe&lt;/cite&gt;, XXV.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Introducing the doctrine in a report to the United States' National Defense University in 1996, Ullman and Wade describe it as an attempt to develop a post-[[Cold War]] military doctrine for the United States. Rapid dominance and shock and awe, they write, may become a "revolutionary change" as the [[United States military]] is reduced in size and information technology is increasingly integrated into warfare.&lt;ref name="rdprologue"&gt;Ullman and Wade, &lt;cite&gt;Shock and Awe&lt;/cite&gt;, Prologue.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent U.S. military authors have written that rapid dominance exploits the "superior technology, precision engagement, and information dominance" of the United States.&lt;ref name="rd3factors"&gt;David J. Gibson, &lt;cite&gt;[http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/fulcrum_main.pl?database=ft_u2&amp;searchid=111016521012191&amp;keyfieldvalue=ADA389508&amp;filename=%2Ffulcrum%2Fdata%2FTR_fulltext%2Fdoc%2FADA389508.pdf Shock and Awe: A Sufficient Condition for Victory?]&lt;/cite&gt; (Newport: United States Naval War College, 2001), 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ullman and Wade identify four vital characteristics of rapid dominance:&lt;ref name="rd4char"&gt;Ullman and Wade, &lt;cite&gt;Shock and Awe&lt;/cite&gt;, XII.&lt;/ref&gt;
# near total or absolute knowledge and understanding of self, adversary, and environment;
# rapidity and timeliness in application;
# operational brilliance in execution; and
# (near) total control and signature management of the entire operational environment.

The term "shock and awe" is most consistently used by Ullman and Wade as the effect that rapid dominance seeks to impose upon an adversary. It is the desired state of helplessness and lack of will. It can be induced, they write, by direct force applied to command and control centers, selective denial of information and dissemination of [[disinformation]], overwhelming combat force, and rapidity of action.

The doctrine of rapid dominance has evolved from the concept of "decisive force". Ulman and Wade contrast the two concepts in terms of objective, use of force, force size, scope, speed, casualties, and technique.

===Civilian casualties and destruction of infrastructure===
Although Ullman and Wade claim that the need to "[m]inimize [[civilian casualties]], loss of life, and [[collateral damage]]" is a "political sensitivity [which needs] to be understood up front", their doctrine of rapid dominance requires the capability to disrupt "means of communication, transportation, food production, water supply, and other aspects of infrastructure",&lt;ref&gt;Ullman and Wade, ''Shock and Awe,'' [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1996/shock-n-awe_intro.html Introduction].&lt;/ref&gt; and, in practice, "the appropriate balance of Shock and Awe must cause ... the threat and fear of action that may shut down all or part of the adversary's society or render his ability to fight useless short of complete physical destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Ullman and Wade, ''Shock and Awe,'' [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1996/shock-n-awe_ch5.html Chapter 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

Using as an example a theoretical invasion of Iraq 20 years after [[Operation Desert Storm]], the authors claimed, "Shutting the country down would entail both the physical destruction of appropriate infrastructure and the shutdown and control of the flow of all vital information and associated commerce so rapidly as to achieve a level of national shock akin to the effect that dropping [[nuclear weapons]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] had on the Japanese."&lt;ref&gt;Ullman and Wade, ''Shock and Awe,'' [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1996/shock-n-awe_ch1.html Chapter 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiterating the example in an interview with [[CBS News]] several months before [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], Ullman stated, "You're sitting in Baghdad and all of a sudden you're the general and 30 of your division headquarters have been wiped out. You also take the city down. By that I mean you get rid of their power, water. In 2, 3, 4, 5 days they are physically, emotionally and psychologically exhausted."&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;CBS Evening News (Jan. 24, 2003)  [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/24/eveningnews/main537928.shtml Interview with Harlan Ullman] accessed August 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|150px|According to its original theorists, shock and awe renders an adversary unwilling to resist through overwhelming displays of power. Ullman cites the atomic bombings of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] (Nagasaki is pictured) as an example of shock and awe.]]
Ullman and Wade argue that there have been military applications that fall within some of the concepts of shock and awe. They enumerate nine examples:
* '''[[Force concentration|Overwhelming force]]''': The "application of massive or overwhelming force" to "disarm, incapacitate, or render the enemy militarily impotent with as few casualties to ourselves and to [[Non-combatant|noncombatants]] as possible."
* '''[[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]''': The establishment of shock and awe through "instant, nearly incomprehensible levels of massive destruction directed at influencing society writ large, meaning its leadership and public, rather than targeting directly against military or strategic objectives even with relatively few numbers or systems."
* '''Massive bombardment''': Described as "precise destructive power largely against military targets and related sectors over time."
* '''[[Blitzkrieg]]''': The "intent was to apply precise, surgical amounts of tightly focused force to achieve maximum leverage but with total economies of scale."
* '''[[Sun Tzu]]''': The "selective, instant beheading of military or societal targets to achieve shock and awe."
* '''Haitian example''': "Imposing shock and awe through a show of force and indeed through deception, misinformation, and disinformation."
* '''The [[Roman legion]]s''': "Achieving shock and awe rests in the ability to deter and overpower an adversary through the adversary's perception and fear of his vulnerability and our own invincibility."
* '''Decay and default''': "The imposition of societal breakdown over a lengthy period, but without the application of massive destruction."

=== First Chechen War ===
Russia's military strategy in the [[First Chechen War]], and particularly the [[Battle of Grozny (1994–95)|Battle of Grozny,]] was described as "shock and awe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2MIFNEcPKcC&amp;pg=PA125|title=Warfare in Woods and Forests|last=Clayton|first=Anthony|date=2011-12-07|publisher=Indiana University Press |year=|isbn=0253005531|location=|pages=125|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq War===
{{main|2003 invasion of Iraq}}

====Buildup====
Before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], United States armed forces officials described their plan as employing shock and awe.&lt;ref name="appterm"&gt;"[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/24/eveningnews/main537928.shtml Iraq Faces Massive U.S. Missile Barrage]" ([[CBS News]], January 24, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conflicting pre-war assessments====
Before its implementation, there was dissent within the Bush Administration as to whether the shock and awe plan would work. According to a CBS News report, "One senior official called it a bunch of bull, but confirmed it is the concept on which the war plan is based." CBS Correspondent David Martin noted that during Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan in the prior year, the U.S. forces were "badly surprised by the willingness of al Qaeda to fight to the death. If the Iraqis fight, the U.S. would have to throw in reinforcements and win the old fashioned way by crushing the Republican Guards, and that would mean more casualties on both sides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Campaign====
Continuous bombing began on March 19, 2003 as United States forces unsuccessfully attempted to kill [[Saddam Hussein]]. Attacks continued against a small number of targets until March 21, 2003, when, at 1700 [[UTC]], the main bombing campaign of the US and their allies began. Its forces launched approximately 1,700 air sorties (504 using [[cruise missile]]s).&lt;ref name="sorties"&gt;"[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2003/uscentaf_oif_report_30apr2003.pdf Operation Iraqi Freedom - By the Numbers]", [[USCENTAF]], April 30, 2003, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Coalition ground forces had begun a "running start" offensive towards [[Baghdad]] on the previous day. Coalition ground forces seized Baghdad on April 5, and the United States declared victory on April 14. The term "shock and awe" is typically used to describe only the very beginning of the invasion of Iraq, not the larger war, nor the ensuing insurgency.

====Conflicting post-war assessments====
To what extent the United States fought a campaign of shock and awe is unclear as post-war assessments are contradictory. Within two weeks of the United States' victory declaration, on April 27, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published an interview with Iraqi military personnel detailing demoralization and lack of command.&lt;ref name="wpinterview"&gt;William Branigin, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A42721-2003Apr26&amp;notFound=true A Brief, Bitter War for Iraq's Military Officers]", [[Washington Post]], October 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the soldiers, Coalition bombing was surprisingly widespread and had a severely demoralizing effect. When United States tanks passed through the Iraqi military's [[Iraqi Republican Guard|Republican Guard]] and [[Iraqi Special Republican Guard|Special Republican Guard]] units outside Baghdad to Saddam's presidential palaces, it caused a shock to troops inside Baghdad. Iraqi soldiers said there was no organization intact by the time the United States entered Baghdad and that resistance crumbled under the presumption that "it wasn't a war, it was suicide."

In contrast, in an October 2003 presentation to the [[United States House of Representatives|United States House]] Committee on Armed Services, staff of the United States Army War College did not attribute their performance to rapid dominance. Rather, they cited technological superiority and "Iraqi ineptitude". The speed of the coalition's actions ("rapidity"), they said, did not affect Iraqi morale. Further, they said that Iraqi armed forces ceased resistance only after direct force-on-force combat within cities.&lt;ref name="usawc"&gt;"[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/congress/2003_hr/03-10-21warcollege.pdf Iraq and the Future of Warfare: Implications for Army and Defense Policy]", presentation by the United States Army War College to United States House Committee on Armed Services, October 21, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''National Geographic'' researcher Bijal Trivedi, "Even after several days of bombing the Iraqis showed remarkable resilience. Many continued with their daily lives, working and shopping, as bombs continued to fall around them. According to some analysts, the military's attack was perhaps too precise. It did not trigger shock and awe in the Iraqis and, in the end, the city was only captured after close combat on the outskirts of Baghdad."&lt;ref name="NatlGeo"&gt;{{cite web

====Criticism of execution====
According to ''[[The Guardian]]'' correspondent [[Brian Whitaker]] in 2003, "To some in the Arab and Muslim countries, Shock and Awe is terrorism by another name; to others, a crime that compares unfavourably with September 11."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Whitaker, B. (March 24, 2003) "Flags in the dust" ''Guardian Unlimited [http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,920806,00.html Iraq special report at guardian.co.uk] accessed July 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-war protesters in 2003 also claimed that "the shock and awe pummeling of Baghdad [was] a kind of terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=March 22, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Casualties====
A dossier released by [[Iraq Body Count]], a project of the U.K. non-governmental non-violent and disarmament organization [[Oxford Research Group]], attributed approximately 6,616 civilian deaths to the actions of U.S.-led forces during the "invasion phase", including the shock-and-awe bombing campaign on Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=July 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings were disputed by both the U.S. military and the Iraqi government. Lieutenant Colonel Steve Boylan, the spokesman for the U.S. military in Baghdad, stated, "I don't know how they are doing their methodology and can't talk to how they calculate their numbers," as well as "we do everything we can to avoid civilian casualties in all of our operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==In popular culture==
Following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by the US, the term "shock and awe" has been used for commercial purposes. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] received at least 29 trademark applications in 2003 for exclusive use of the term.&lt;ref name="29patents"&gt;Robert Longley, "[http://usgovinfo.about.com/cs/censusstatistic/a/shockandawe.htm Patent Office Suffers 'Shock and Awe' Attack]", [[About.com]], October 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The first came from a fireworks company on the day the US started bombing [[Baghdad]]. [[Sony]] registered the trademark the day after the beginning of the operation for use in a video game title but later withdrew the application and described it as "an exercise of regrettable bad judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title=Tech Briefs: Sony says it's sorry for 'shock and awe' idea
|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/118102_tbrf18.html
|publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer
|date=April 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of a level in the video game ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'', in which the player character experiences a nuclear detonation. The preceding section of the game is an example of Shock and Awe tactics, as the [[United States Marine Corps]] executes the strategy in an unnamed Middle Eastern country. The term is also used as an achievement in the popularly acclaimed game ''[[Starcraft 2]]'', where it is obtained when a certain number of units die to the tactical strike craft whilst invisible. It is also the name of an achievement in ''[[Gears of War 2]]'' and Miss Fortune's weapons in ''[[League of Legends]]''. Miscellaneous other uses of the term include golf equipment, an insecticide, a set of bowling balls, a racehorse, a shampoo, condoms, and heroin.

In an interview, Harlan Ullman stated that he believed that using the term to try to sell products was "probably a mistake," and "the marketing value will be somewhere between slim and none."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;!--Trivial pop culture inside these comments
In the 2011 scifi film ''[[Battle: Los Angeles]]'', the hostile aliens that are invading Earth are stated during a press conference to be carrying out a "textbook campaign of rapid dominance".

In episode 7 ("Broken Rules") of the USA television series ''[[Burn Notice]]'', Michael Weston applies a series of tactics he describes as rapid dominance.

The title of [[country music]] artist [[Toby Keith]]'s 2003 album ''[[Shock'n Y'all]]'' is a play on the phrase.

In [[Avatar (2009 film)]] the Earth mercenary military use the "Shock and Awe" operation against the indigenous Navi population of [[planet Pandora]].

In March 2003 the musical group Shock And Awe formed in Edinburgh, Scotland. Their song about the war "Take Me Back to Iraq" has been played on radio stations and Internet podcasts around the world.

[[Neil Young]]'s 2006 album "[[Living With War]]" features a song titled "Shock and Awe." The album largely represented Young's response to the invasion of Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom).

In the game [[Command &amp; Conquer: Generals]] and its expansion pack Zero Hour the phrase "Shock and Awe" is used by The American Army. In the game [[Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars]], Killian states that the GDI are striking back using "Shock and Awe".

In the video game [[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]], a level set during a conflict in the Middle East is entitled "Shock and Awe" where US Marines invade a Middle Eastern city in overwhelming force to capture the terrorist leader Khaled Al-Asad. The force used include large numbers of US Marines, [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|Cobra Helicopters]] and [[M1 Abrams|M1A1 Abrams Tanks]]. The mission ends in failure when a [[nuclear warhead]] goes off.

In the television series "Burn Notice" Rapid Dominance was featured in a Season 1 episode.

In December 2008, an online game entitled [http://www.sockandawe.com "Sock and Awe"] was released as a satire on the [http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iraqi_journalist_throws_shoes_at_US_president_George_Bush shoes thrown at President Bush].--&gt;

In the letters to the [[Seven churches of Asia|early Christian churches]] of [[Smyrna]] and [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]] in {{bibleverse||Revelation|2:9|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|3:9|NKJV}}, reference is made to a '''synagogue of Satan''' ({{lang-gr|συναγωγή τοῦ Σατανᾶ}}, ''synagoge tou satana''), in each case referring to a group [[Persecution of Christians in the New Testament|persecuting]] the church "who say they are [[Jews]] and are not". In [[Revelation 2]], the Smyrna church is advised not to fear the events they are about to suffer; in [[Revelation 3]], the Philadelphia church is promised that the persecutors will "come and worship before [their] feet, and ... know that I have loved you".

The phrase is also used in a fragment of a [[lost work]] on [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria|Dioscorus I of Alexandria]] found at the [[Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great]] in 1923 and identified by American theologian [[William Hatch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, W., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1507736.pdf A Fragment of a Lost Work on Dioscorus], ''Harvard Theological Review'', Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1926), pp. 377-381&lt;/ref&gt; Hatch believes the term refers to the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which Dioscorus attended in 451 and from which he was deposed and exiled for his [[monophysite]] [[Christology]].

December 1947}}''' is a professor in the Graduate School of Law at [[Hitotsubashi University]], and professor emeritus of [[Tokyo Metropolitan University]].&lt;ref name=read&gt;"[http://read.jst.go.jp/public/cs_ksh_007EventAction.do?action4=event&amp;lang_act4=E&amp;judge_act4=2&amp;knkysh_name_code=6000009243 Mizubayashi Takeshi]." Directory Database of Research and Development Activities (ReaD). 9 January 2009. Accessed 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His field of specialty is the history of law in Japan,&lt;ref name=read/&gt; though he is perhaps most well known for his arguments regarding the political organization of [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]].

Mizubayashi earned his [[bachelor's degree]] from the Faculty of Law at [[Tokyo University]] in 1970, and a [[master's degree]] from the Graduate School, Division of Law and Politics at the same university, in 1972.&lt;ref name=read/&gt;

He served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Japan Legal History Association from 2005-2008.&lt;ref name=read/&gt;

==Research==
Mizubayashi coined the term {{nihongo|"compound state"|複合国家|fukugō kokka}},&lt;ref name=ravina&gt;Ravina, Mark. ''Land and Lordship in Early Modern Japan'. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999. p27.&lt;/ref&gt; a term now widely used by Western scholars as well, including [[Mark Ravina]]&lt;ref name=ravina/&gt; and [[Ronald Toby]].&lt;ref name=toby&gt;Toby, Ronald. "Rescuing the Nation from History: The State of the State in Early Modern Japan." ''Monumenta Nipponica'', Vol. 56, No. 2. (Summer, 2001), pp. 197-237.&lt;/ref&gt; Using this term, Mizubayashi and others reenvision the Tokugawa state not as a single, unified, bureaucratic entity, but as a feudal conglomeration of {{nihongo|domains|藩|[[han (country subdivision)|han]]}} loosely tied together by their fealty to the shogunate, and by other obligations and systems imposed by the shogunate. In other words, he refocuses attention away from the shogunate, to the individual domains; building upon Mizubayashi's work, a considerable number of scholars have since published articles and books analyzing the history of individual ''han'' and reconsidering the extent to which they might be regarded as separate small countries, more loosely connected to the shogunate than was previously thought.&lt;ref name=toby/&gt;

Mizubayashi also argued that the decentralized nature of the Tokugawa state was due not primarily to a weak shogunate, but to the strength of the domains (''han''). In particular, he pointed to the strength of the ''ie'' system, under which daimyo (feudal lords) were dedicated to protecting the honor, integrity, and wealth or power of their clan. Not strictly a matter of family or household honor and integrity, ''ie'' or clans were often continued by an adopted heir without diminishing its legitimacy. In Mizubayashi's vision, the political system of Tokugawa Japan was founded upon the ''ie''. Tokugawa Japan consisted of a number of daimyo clans [[fief|enfeoffed]] by the Tokugawa clan, and in turn regarding other smaller samurai clans, merchant households, and peasant households as their vassals or subjects; Ravina also points out that religious institutions were frequently operated like ''ie'' in the Tokugawa period, with continuation of the order under an heir (adopted or otherwise) of the current head.&lt;ref&gt;Ravina. pp37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1795">An '''utraquist school''' or '''utraquist gymnasium''' is a term for [[bilingual]] [[school]]s in some countries, in which the subjects were taught both in a [[state language]] and in the language of some [[ethnic minority]]. The term "utraquist" here is in an [[analogy]] with the [[Catholic]] concept of [[utraquism]] (from [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''uterque'', ''utraque'', "both"/"each (of the two)").

Such schools existed, e.g., in [[Poland]], in areas dominated by [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]] ("[[Kresy Wschodnie]]"), and in [[Austria-Hungary]]/[[Austria]] of 19th and early 20th centuries, in the areas of numerous ethnic minorities.

{{Lead too short|date=September 2016}}

'''Value criticism''' (in German ''Wertkritik'') is a branch of [[post-Marxism]] which criticizes [[Capitalism|capitalistic society]]. Value criticism follows in the traditions of the [[Frankfurt School]] and [[critical theory]] developed under [[Max Horkheimer]]. Prominent adherents of value criticism include [[Robert Kurz (philosopher)|Robert Kurz]], Roswitha Scholz, [[Moishe Postone]] and Jean-Marie Vincent.
==Aspects of value criticism==
Value criticism takes crucial aspects of Marx's critiques of [[commodity fetishism]], commodities and value, while criticizing Marx's theory of [[Class conflict|class struggle]] and [[historical materialism]]. As a result, proponents of Value Criticism feel that the working class is not necessarily a revolutionary subject. Instead, it is pointed out that labor has to be understood as a historic specific entity and that criticizing capitalism implies not only criticizing the distribution process in capitalism, but also the capitalistic production process and the productive powers. From this, they conclude that [[all actually existing socialisms thus far]] have been in essence forms of [[state-led capitalism]], where production still followed capitalistic principles. This interpretation, which rejects the traditional Marxist point of view, is defended in the [[Refusal of work#Manifesto Against Labour|''Manifesto Against Labour'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krisis.org/1999/manifesto-against-labour |title=Manifesto against Labour |publisher=Krisis |date=1999-12-31 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of value-direction==
In addition to value criticism, a new branch appeared within a circle of theorists led by Roswitha Scholz. The so-called critique of value direction (in German called "Wertabspaltungskritik") includes not only precise descriptions of the "abstract and fetishized character of modern domination",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://platypus1917.org/2013/05/01/marx-and-wertkritik/ |title=Marx and "Wertkritik" : Platypus |publisher=Platypus1917.org |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also seeks to explain why irrational attitudes are delegated to women, while men are counted as relatively rational actors in the capitalistic society.

Many leftists{{Who|date=February 2014}} claim that books such as [[Schwarzbuch Kapitalismus|''The Black Book of Capitalism'']] neither offers a realistic alternative to capitalistic society nor provide any options for actions to overcome capitalism. Additionally, Gerhard Hanloser and Karl Reitter claim that value criticism is a critique from the standpoint of the circulation sphere which can not be explained from within itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grundrisse.net/grundrisse17/17karl_reitter.htm |title=Das Kapital wieder lesen |publisher=Grundrisse.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Publishers of value criticism in Germany are the ''[[Krisis (German journal)|Krisis]]'' group and [[Exit!]], to both of which Robert Kurz made crucial contributions. Much value critical literature has still to be translated into English. Elmar Flatschart from the University of Vienna is also publishing in English for the Exit! group. Moishe Postone and his work "Time, Labor and Social Domination" is often cited by value critics.

'''''WALL-E''''' (stylized with an [[interpunct]] as '''''WALL·E''''') is a 2008 American [[Computer-animated film|computer-animated]] [[science fiction film]]&lt;!-- Any genre sources other than comedy will need reliable sourcing for inclusion. --&gt; produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] for [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It was directed and co-written by [[Andrew Stanton]], produced by [[Jim Morris (film producer)|Jim Morris]], and co-written by [[Jim Reardon]]. It stars the voices of [[Ben Burtt]], [[Elissa Knight]], [[Jeff Garlin]], [[Fred Willard]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Kathy Najimy]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]], and was [[List of Pixar films|the overall ninth feature film produced by the company]]. It follows a solitary [[trash compactor]] robot on a future deserted Earth, left to clean up garbage. However, he is visited by a probe sent by the starship ''Axiom'', whom he falls in love with and pursues across the galaxy.

After directing ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space. ''WALL-E'' has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with [[body language]] and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes [[consumerism]], [[corporatism]], [[nostalgia]], [[waste management]], [[human impact on the environment|human environmental impact and concerns]], [[obesity]], and [[global catastrophic risk]].&lt;ref name="Murray and Heumann, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Robin L.|author2=Heumann, Joseph K. |title=WALL-E: From Environmental Adaptation to Sentimental Nostalgia|journal=Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media|date=Spring 2009|series=No. 51|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc51.2009/WallE/text.html|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, ''WALL-E'' was paired with a short film titled ''[[Presto (film)|Presto]]'' for its theatrical release.

''WALL-E'' was released in the United States on June 27, 2008. The film was an instant [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], grossing $533.3 million worldwide over a $180 million budget, and winning the 2008 [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]], the 2009 [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation#Long Form|Hugo Award for Best Long Form Dramatic Presentation]],&lt;ref name="Hugo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2009-hugo-awards/ |title=2009 Hugo Awards |publisher=The Hugo Awards |accessdate=April 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yVVJU4bH?url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2009-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=May 7, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the final [[Nebula Award for Best Script]],&lt;ref name="Nebula"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Nebula2009.html |title=Nebula Award winners for 2008 announced |publisher=LOCUS |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231125/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Nebula2009.html |archivedate=June 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Saturn Award for Best Animated Film]] and the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] with five nominations.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words! --&gt;
In the 29th century, [[Earth]] has been abandoned and covered in garbage, its population having been evacuated by the [[megacorporation]] Buy-N-Large (BnL) on giant [[Generation ship|starliners]] seven centures earlier after decades of mass [[consumerism]] facilitated by BnL. BnL has left behind WALL-E robot [[trash compactor]]s to clean up; however, all have since stopped functioning, except one unit who has gained [[sentience]] and is scavenging parts from other units to remain active. One day, WALL-E discovers a healthy [[seedling]], which he returns to his trailer home. Later, an unmanned spaceship lands and deploys an EVE probe to scan the planet for plant life. WALL-E is infatuated with EVE, who is initially hostile but gradually befriends him. When WALL-E brings EVE to his trailer and shows her the plant, however, she suddenly takes the plant inside her and goes into [[standby mode]]. WALL-E, confused, unsuccessfully tries to reactivate her. The ship then returns to collect EVE, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner ''Axiom''.

The ''Axiom''{{'}}s passengers have become [[obese]] and feeble due to [[microgravity]] and reliance on an automated lifestyle, including the ship's current captain, McCrea, who leaves the ship under the control of the robotic [[autopilot]], AUTO. EVE is taken to the bridge, with WALL-E tagging along. McCrea is unprepared for a positive probe response, but learns that placing EVE's plant in the ship's Holo-Detector for verification will trigger a [[jump drive|hyperjump]] back to Earth so humanity can recolonize it. The plant proves to be missing from EVE's storage compartment, though, and she blames WALL-E for its disappearance.

With the plant missing, EVE is deemed [[fault (technology)|faulty]] and taken to Diagnostics. WALL-E misinterprets the procedure as torture, and in intervening accidentally frees a group of malfunctioning robots and causes both EVE and himself to be designated as rogue robots. Frustrated, EVE takes WALL-E to an [[escape pod]] to send him home to retrieve the plant, but they are interrupted when first mate robot GO-4 arrives with the plant, having stolen it from EVE on AUTO's orders. GO-4 places the plant in an escape pod and sets it to self-destruct, but WALL-E enters just before it is [[Jettison (aviation)|jettisoned]]. WALL-E escapes, saving the plant, and he and EVE reconcile and celebrate with a dance in space around the ''Axiom''.

EVE brings the plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's recordings of Earth and concludes that they have to return to clean up. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive [[A113]], issued to BnL autopilots after the corporation concluded in 2110 that the planet could not be saved. AUTO [[mutiny|mutinies]], electrocuting WALL-E and shutting EVE down, and throwing them both down the garbage chute before confining the captain to his quarters. EVE automatically reboots herself and helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector chamber; AUTO tries to close the chamber, crushing WALL-E as he struggles to keep it open. Seeing WALL-E's sacrifice, McCrea successfully deactivates AUTO while EVE inserts the plant to activate the hyperjump.

Arriving back on Earth, EVE repairs WALL-E, but finds that his memory has been reset and his personality is gone. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a farewell kiss, which sparks his memory and restores his original personality. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the ''Axiom'' begin to restore Earth and its environment. During the credits, scenes of the humans and robots learning to farm, fish, and build are shown in various art styles, with the implication being that Earth is turned into a paradise over several generations.

==Cast==
*[[Ben Burtt]] as WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-Class),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1813964,00.html|title=WALL-E: Pixar's Biggest Gamble|last=Corliss|first=Richard|date=June 12, 2008|work=Time|access-date=September 23, 2017|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[title character]]. WALL-E, a robot who has achieved sentience, and is the only robot of his kind shown to be still functioning on Earth. He is a small mobile compactor box with all-terrain treads, three-fingered shovel hands, binocular eyes, and retractable solar cells for power. Although working diligently to fulfill his directive to clean up the garbage (all the while accompanied by his cockroach friend Hal and music playing from his on-board recorder) he is distracted by his curiosity, collecting trinkets of interest. He stores and displays these "treasures" such as a [[birdcage]] full of [[rubber duck]]s, a [[Rubik's Cube]], [[Zippo]]s, disposable cups filled with plastic cutlery and a golden [[trophy]] at his home where he examines and categorizes his finds while throwing away things like a [[diamond]] ring, and watching a [[video cassette]] of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' via an [[iPod]] viewed through a large [[Fresnel lens]].
** Burtt is also credited for the voice of M-O (Microbe-Obliterator), a tiny, obsessively clean maintenance cleanerbot with rollers for arms who keeps the ''Axiom'' clean.
* [[Elissa Knight]] as EVE (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a sleek robot probe whose directive is to locate vegetation on Earth and verify habitability. She has a glossy white egg-shaped body and blue [[LED]] eyes. She moves using [[antigravity]] technology and is equipped with scanners, specimen storage and a "[[Plasma weapon (fiction)|quasar ion cannon]]" in her arm, which she is quick to use.
* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Captain B. McCrea, the commanding officer of the ''Axiom''. He is merely a [[figurehead]], with the ship's autopilot handling all true command functions. He is credited simply as "Captain" and his name is only seen on a wall depicting portraits of all the ship's captains.
* [[Fred Willard]] as Shelby Forthright, the CEO of the Buy n Large Corporation and the only major live-action character, shown only in videos recorded around the time of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s initial launch in the early 22nd century. Constantly optimistic, Forthright proposed the plan to evacuate Earth's population to space, then clean up the planet so they could return within five years. However, the corporation soon abandoned the cleanup and recolonization, believing that Earth had become too toxic to support life. Forthright is the first live-action character with a speaking role in any Pixar film.
* [[John Ratzenberger]] and [[Kathy Najimy]] as John and Mary, respectively. John and Mary both live on the ''Axiom'' and are so dependent on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings, for instance not noticing that the ship features a giant swimming pool. However, they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, eventually meeting face-to-face for the first time.
* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as the voice of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s computer. Stanton joked about the role with Weaver, saying, "You realize you get to be 'Mother' now?"&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;&lt;ref name="dvd-mother"&gt;DVD. Scene 16. "Captain on Deck". Audio commentary by Director Andrew Stanton. 52:01–52:09.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the name of the ship's computer in the film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', which also starred Weaver.&lt;ref name="dvd-mother" /&gt;
*[[PlainTalk|MacInTalk]], the text-to-speech program for the Apple [[Macintosh]] computers, was used for the voice of AUTO, the rogue [[artificial intelligence]] [[autopilot]] built into the ship. Unlike other robots in the film, AUTO is not influenced by WALL-E, but instead follows directive [[A113]], which is to prevent the ''Axiom'' and the humans from returning to Earth because of the toxicity, and it works to prevent anyone from deviating from it.

Andrew Stanton conceived ''WALL-E'' during a lunch with fellow writers [[John Lasseter]], [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]] in 1994. ''[[Toy Story]]'' was near completion and the writers brainstormed ideas for their next projects—''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', and ''[[Finding Nemo]]''—at this lunch. Stanton asked, "What if mankind had to leave Earth and somebody forgot to turn off the last robot?"&lt;ref name=notes&gt;{{cite web|title=Production notes|url=http://adisney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/wall-e/media/downloads/WALLEProductionNotes.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711103245/http://adisney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/wall-e/media/downloads/WALLEProductionNotes.pdf|publisher=[[Walt Disney Pictures]]|accessdate=July 19, 2008|archivedate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having struggled for many years with making the characters in ''[[Toy Story]]'' appealing, Stanton found his simple ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''-esque idea of a lonely robot on a deserted planet strong.&lt;ref name=awn&gt;{{cite news|author=Bill Desowitz |title=Stanton Powers Up WALL•E |work=[[Animation World Network]] |date=April 7, 2008 |url=http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&amp;article_no=3601&amp;page=1 |accessdate=November 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301043642/http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&amp;article_no=3601&amp;page=1 |archivedate=March 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/interview/andrew_stanton |title=Andrew Stanton |work=[[The A.V.

Stanton and Pete Docter developed the film under the title of ''Trash Planet'' for two months in 1995, but they did not know how to develop the story and Docter chose to direct ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' instead.&lt;ref name=total&gt;{{cite news | author = James White | title = How We Made WALL-E | work = [[Total Film]] | date = April 2008 | pages=113–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hauser11&gt;Hauser, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton came up with the idea of WALL-E finding a plant, because his life as the sole inhabitant on a deserted world reminded Stanton of a plant growing among pavements.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite news|author=Sarah Ball |title=Mr. Oscar, Tear Down This Wall!

O'Bannon wrote his script in a manner Stanton found reminded him of ''[[haiku]]'', where visual descriptions were done in continuous lines of a few words. Stanton wrote his robot dialogue conventionally, but placed them in brackets.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; In late 2003, Stanton and a few others created a [[story reel]] of the first twenty minutes of the film. Lasseter and [[Steve Jobs]] were impressed and officially began development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alex Billington|publisher=FirstShowing.net|date=June 23, 2008|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/06/23/interview-wall-es-writer-and-director-andrew-stanton/|title=Interview: Wall-E's Writer and Director Andrew Stanton|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Jobs stated he did not like the title, originally spelled "''W.A.L.-E.''"&lt;ref&gt;''Title Animation Test'', 2008 DVD, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the first act of ''WALL-E'' "fell out of the sky" for Stanton,&lt;ref name=screenwriting/&gt; he had originally wanted aliens to plant EVE to explore Earth and the rest of the film was different. When WALL-E comes to the ''Axiom'', he incites a ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''-style rebellion by the robots against the remnants of the human race, which were cruel alien Gels (completely devolved, gelatinous, boneless, legless, see-through, green creatures that resemble [[Jell-O]]). James Hicks, a physiologist, mentioned to Stanton the concept of [[atrophy]] and the effects prolonged [[weightlessness]] would have on humans living in space for an inordinately extended time period.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cinechew.com/the-science-of-wall-e/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208013846/http://cinechew.com/the-science-of-wall-e/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 8, 2015|title=The Science of 'Wall-E'|date=December 9, 2008|accessdate=February 7, 2015|author=James Hicks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.today.uci.edu/Features/profile_detail.asp?key=369 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726230400/http://today.uci.edu/Features/profile_detail.asp?key=369 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 26, 2008 |title=James Hicks, Ecology &amp; evolutionary biology professor |publisher=Today@UCI |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=January 14, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this was the inspiration of the humans degenerating into the alien Gels,&lt;ref name=deleted&gt;Deleted scenes with introductions by Andrew Stanton, 2008 DVD, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt; and their ancestry would have been revealed in a ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''-style ending.&lt;ref name=newsarama2/&gt; The Gels also spoke a made-up gibberish language, but Stanton scrapped this idea because he thought it would be too complicated for the audience to understand and they could easily be driven off from the storyline.&lt;ref name=evolution&gt;''Captain's Log: The Evolution of Humans'', 2008 DVD featurette, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt; The Gels had a royal family, who host a dance in a castle on a lake in the back of the ship, and the ''Axiom'' curled up into a ball when returning to Earth in this incarnation of the story.&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt; Stanton decided this was too bizarre and unengaging, and conceived humanity as "big babies".&lt;ref name=newsarama2/&gt; Stanton developed the metaphorical theme of the humans learning to stand again and "grow[ing] up",&lt;ref name=newsarama2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsarama.com/film/080704-wall-e-stanton-2.html|author=Steve Fritz|title=How Andrew Stanton &amp; Pixar Created ''WALL*E''&amp;nbsp;– Part II|work=[[Newsarama]]|date=July 4, 2008|accessdate=November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DVD.

Stanton first decided to put a nose and ears on the Gels so the audience could recognize them. Eventually, fingers, legs, clothes, and other characteristics were added until they arrived at the concept of being fetus-like to allow the audience to see themselves in the characters.&lt;ref name="evolution"/&gt;

In a later version of the film, Auto comes to the docking bay to retrieve EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view. As an homage to ''[[Get Smart]]'',&lt;ref name=comingsoon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=45885|author=Joshua Starnes|title=WALL•E Writer/Director Andrew Stanton|publisher=ComingSoon.net|date=June 13, 2008|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auto takes the plant and goes into the bowels of the ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme to clean up the Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic.&lt;ref name=deleted/&gt; One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he really takes command of the ''Axiom''.&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt;

Originally, EVE would have been electrocuted by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection at the hands of the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship.&lt;ref name=deleted/&gt; Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end. Jim Capobianco, director of the ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'' short film ''[[Your Friend the Rat]]'', created an end credits animation that continued the story—and stylized in different artistic movements throughout history—to clarify an optimistic tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andrew Stanton and Ben Burtt talk WALL-E |author=Joanna Cohen |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=September 17, 2008 |url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/wall_e/news/1756410/rt_au_interview_andrew_stanton_and_ben_burtt_talk_wall_e |accessdate=November 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311134949/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/wall_e/news/1756410/rt_au_interview_andrew_stanton_and_ben_burtt_talk_wall_e |archivedate=March 11, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
''WALL-E'' was the most complex Pixar production since ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' because of the world and the history that had to be conveyed.&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75,000 [[storyboard]]s, ''WALL-E'' required 125,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Derek Thompson |title=The Storyboards of ''WALL-E'' |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=July 17, 2008 |url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/wall_e/news/1741889/2/exclusive_the_storyboards_of_wall_e |accessdate=November 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301120838/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/wall_e/news/1741889/2/exclusive_the_storyboards_of_wall_e |archivedate=March 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Production designer]] [[Ralph Eggleston]] wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic, and that of the second act on the ''Axiom'' to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the ''Axiom'' environment.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; Pixar studied [[Chernobyl]] and the city of [[Sofia]] to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from [[Bulgaria]] and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage.&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The overexposed light makes the location look more vast. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they would have lost shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a [[Christmas tree]]. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E—who was made yellow to emulate a tractor—would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.&lt;ref name=eggleston/&gt;
[[File:WALLElighting.jpg|thumb|left|alt=WALL-E holding a [[bra]]|WALL-E finds a bra. [[Roger Deakins]] and [[Dennis Muren]] were consulted on realistic lighting including backgrounds that are less focused than foregrounds.]]
Stanton also wanted the lighting to look realistic and evoke the science fiction films of his youth. He thought that Pixar captured the physics of being underwater with ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and so for ''WALL-E'', he wanted to push that for air. While rewatching some of his favorite science fiction films, he realized that Pixar's other movies had lacked the look of [[70 mm film]] and its barrel [[distortion (optics)|distortion]], [[lens flare]], and [[racking focus]].&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; Producer Jim Morris invited [[Roger Deakins]] and [[Dennis Muren]] to advise on lighting and atmosphere. Muren spent several months with Pixar, while Deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks. Stanton said Muren's experience came from integrating computer animation into live-action settings, while Deakins helped them understand not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting.&lt;ref name=aicn/&gt; 1970s [[Panavision cameras]] were used to help the animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; The first lighting test included building a three-dimensional replica of WALL-E, filming it with a 70&amp;nbsp;mm camera, and then trying to replicate that in the computer.&lt;ref name=ign&gt;{{cite news | author1 = Steven Horn | author2 = Eric Moro | lastauthoramp = yes | title = Wall•E Preview | work = [[IGN]] | date = April 7, 2008 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/865/865021p1.html | accessdate = November 23, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080412104219/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/865/865021p1.html | archivedate = April 12, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton cited the shallow lens work of [[Gus Van Sant]]'s films as an influence, as it created intimacy in each close-up. Stanton chose angles for the virtual cameras that a live-action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set.&lt;ref name=screenwriting/&gt;

Stanton wanted the ''Axiom''{{'}}s interior to resemble Shanghai and [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; Eggleston studied 1960s NASA paintings and the original concept art for [[Tomorrowland]] for the ''Axiom'', to reflect that era's sense of optimism.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; Stanton remarked "We are all probably very similar in our backgrounds here [at Pixar] in that we all miss the Tomorrowland that was promised us from the heyday of [[Disneyland]]," and wanted a "[[jet pack]]" feel.&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; Pixar also studied the [[Disney Cruise Line]] and visited [[Las Vegas]], which was helpful in understanding artificial lighting.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; Eggleston based his ''Axiom'' designs on the futuristic architecture of [[Santiago Calatrava]]. Eggleston divided the inside of the ship into three sections; the rear's economy class has a basic gray concrete texture with graphics keeping to the red, blue, and white of the BnL logo. The coach class with living/shopping spaces has "S" shapes as people are always looking for "what's around the corner". Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs. The premier class is a large [[Zen]]-like spa with colors limited to turquoise, cream, and tan, and leads on to the captain's warm carpeted and wooded quarters and the sleek dark bridge.&lt;ref name=eggleston&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationartconservation.com/?c=art&amp;p=wall_e_design_with_a_purpose|title=Design With a Purpose: An interview with Ralph Eggleston|work=Animation Art Conservation|author=Ron Barbagallo|date=January 2009|accessdate=February 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the artificial ''Axiom'', camera movements were modeled after those of the [[steadicam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mag.awn.com/article_view.php?id=3682&amp;page=all|format=Printable version|date=June 27, 2008|title=Hello, WALL•E!: Pixar Reaches for the Stars|work=[[Animation World Network]]|author=Bill Desowitz|accessdate=February 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720073659/http://mag.awn.com/article_view.php?id=3682&amp;page=all|archivedate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of live action was a stepping stone for Pixar, as Stanton was planning to make ''[[John Carter (film)|John Carter of Mars]]'' his next project.&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; Storyboarder Derek Thompson noted introducing live action meant that they would make the rest of the film look even more realistic.&lt;ref name=ripple/&gt; Eggleston added that if the historical humans had been animated and slightly caricaturized, the audience then would not have been able to recognize how serious their devolution was.&lt;ref name=eggleston/&gt; Stanton cast [[Fred Willard]] as the historical Buy n Large CEO because "[h]e's the most friendly and insincere car salesman I could think of."&lt;ref name=newsarama2/&gt; The CEO says "[[stay the course]]", which Stanton used because he thought it was funny.&lt;ref name=moviesonline/&gt; [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] did the visual effects for these shots.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

===Animation===
''WALL-E'' went undeveloped during the 1990s partly because Stanton and Pixar were not confident enough yet to have a feature length film with a main character that behaved like [[Luxo Jr.]] or [[R2-D2]].&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; Stanton explained there are two types of robots in cinema: "human[s] with metal skin", like the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]], or "machine[s] with function" like Luxo and R2. He found the latter idea "powerful" because it allowed the audience to project personalities onto the characters, as they do with babies and pets: "You're compelled ... you almost can't stop yourself from finishing the sentence 'Oh, I think it likes me! I think it's hungry! I think it wants to go for a walk!'"&lt;ref name=newsarama1&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Fritz|title=How Andrew Stanton &amp; Pixar Created ''WALL*E''&amp;nbsp;– Part I|work=[[Newsarama]]|date=July 1, 2008|url=http://www.newsarama.com/film/080701-wall-e-lasseter.html|accessdate=November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, "We wanted the audience to believe they were witnessing a machine that has come to life."&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; The animators visited recycling stations to study machinery, and also met robot designers, visited [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] to study robots, watched a recording of a [[Mars rover]],&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; and borrowed a [[Remote control vehicle#Military and law enforcement|bomb detecting robot]] from the [[San Francisco Police Department]]. Simplicity was preferred in their performances as giving them too many movements would make them feel human.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

Stanton wanted WALL-E to be a box and EVE to be like an egg.&lt;ref name=duo&gt;''WALL-E and EVE'', 2008 DVD, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]&lt;/ref&gt; WALL-E's eyes were inspired by a pair of [[binoculars]] Stanton was given when watching the [[Oakland Athletics]] play against the [[Boston Red Sox]].

This arm design contributed to creating the character's posture, so if they wanted him to be nervous, they would lower them.&lt;ref name=better&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Debruge|title=How to build a better robot|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 18, 2008|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987668.html|accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanton wanted EVE to be at the higher end of technology, and asked [[iPod]] designer [[Jonathan Ive]] to inspect her design. He was very impressed.&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; Her eyes are modelled on [[Lite-Brite]] toys,&lt;ref name=nydn/&gt; but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar.&lt;ref name=duo/&gt; Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing, relying on posing her body to express emotion.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; They also found her similar to a [[manatee]] or a [[narwhal]] because her floating body resembled an underwater creature.&lt;ref name=duo/&gt; Auto was a conscious homage to [[HAL 9000]] from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and the usage of [[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|''Also sprach Zarathustra'']] for the showdown between Captain McCrea and Auto furthers that.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2010}} The manner in which he hangs from a wall or ceiling gives him a threatening feel, like a spider.&lt;ref name=robot&gt;''Robo-everything'', 2008 DVD featurette, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Auto was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots.&lt;ref name=deleted/&gt; The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their [[blubber]]y bodies,&lt;ref name=eggleston/&gt; as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

To animate their robots, the film's story crew and animation crew watched a Keaton and a [[Charlie Chaplin]] film every day for almost a year, and occasionally a [[Harold Lloyd]] picture.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; Afterwards, the filmmakers knew all emotions could be conveyed silently. Stanton cited Keaton's "great stone face" as giving them perseverance in animating a character with an unchanging expression.&lt;ref name=nydn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2008/06/22/2008-06-22_walle_is_a_real_character.html|author=Joe Strike|title='WALL-E' is a real character|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=June 22, 2008|accessdate=July 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he rewatched these, Stanton felt that filmmakers—since the advent of sound—relied on dialogue too much to convey exposition.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; The filmmakers dubbed the cockroach WALL-E keeps as a pet "Hal", in reference to silent film producer [[Hal Roach]] (as well as being an additional reference to HAL 9000).&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; They also watched ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' and ''[[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Never Cry Wolf]]'', films that had sound but were not reliant on dialogue.&lt;ref name=ripple&gt;{{cite news|author=Joe Utichi |title=The World of WALL-E |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=July 16, 2008 |url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/wall_e/news/1741516/exclusive_the_world_of_wall_e |accessdate=November 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201043530/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/wall_e/news/1741516/exclusive_the_world_of_wall_e |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton acknowledged ''[[Silent Running]]'' as an influence because its silent robots were a forerunner to the likes of R2-D2,&lt;ref name=aicn/&gt; and that the "hopeless romantic" [[Woody Allen]] also inspired WALL-E.&lt;ref name=total/&gt;

===Sound===
Producer Jim Morris recommended [[Ben Burtt]] as [[sound design]]er for ''WALL-E'' because Stanton kept using [[R2-D2]] as the benchmark for the robots.&lt;ref name=comingsoon/&gt; Burtt had completed ''[[Star Wars: Episode III&amp;nbsp;– Revenge of the Sith]]'' and told his wife he would no longer work on films with robots, but found ''WALL-E'' and its substitution of voices with sound "fresh and exciting".&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; He recorded 2500 sounds for the film, which was twice the average number for a ''[[Star Wars]]'' film,&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; and a record in his career.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; Burtt began work in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/30/entertainment/et-burtt30|title=Ben Burtt: The man behind R2-D2 and Wall-E's beeps|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Tom Russo|date=June 30, 2008

During production Burtt had the opportunity to look at the items used by [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]], Disney's in-house sound designer for many of their classic films. Burtt used many of MacDonald's items on ''WALL-E''. Because Burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post-production, the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas, which Burtt found an unusual experience.&lt;ref name=sound&gt;''Animation Sound Design: Building Worlds From The Sound Up'' featurette, 2008 DVD featurette, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in sync with the animators, returning their animation after adding the sounds to give them more ideas.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; Burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character, but if he could not find one that worked, he would choose a dramatic and unrealistic noise.&lt;ref name=sound/&gt; Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters, before he and Stanton pared it down to a distinct few for each robot.&lt;ref name=awn/&gt;

Burtt saw a hand-cranked electrical generator while watching ''[[Island in the Sky (1953 film)|Island in the Sky]]'', and bought an identical, unpacked device from 1950 on [[eBay]] to use for WALL-E moving around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A With WALL•E's Ben Burtt|publisher=Pixar Planet|date=November 13, 2008|url=http://pixarplanet.com/blog/qa-with-walles-ben-burtt|accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burtt also used an [[automobile self starter]] for when WALL-E goes fast,&lt;ref name=sound/&gt; and the sound of cars being wrecked at a [[demolition derby]] provided for WALL-E's compressing trash in his body.&lt;ref name=shot/&gt; The [[Macintosh]] computer [[Chime (Macintosh)|chime]] was used to signify when WALL-E has fully recharged his battery. For EVE, Burtt wanted her humming to have a musical quality.&lt;ref name=sound/&gt; Burtt was only able to provide neutral or masculine voices, so Pixar employee Elissa Knight was asked to provide her voice for Burtt to electronically modify.

[[Thomas Newman]] recollaborated with Stanton on ''WALL-E'' since the two got along well on ''Nemo'', which gave Newman the Annie Award for Best Music in an Animated Feature. He began writing the score in 2005, in the hope that starting this task early would make him more involved with the finished film. But, Newman remarked that animation is so dependent on scheduling he should have begun work earlier on when Stanton and Reardon were writing the script. EVE's theme was arranged for the first time in October 2007. Her theme when played as she first flies around Earth originally used more orchestral elements, and Newman was encouraged to make it sound more feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ScoreKeeper Chats With Composer Thomas Newman!!|work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=September 16, 2008|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38356|accessdate=September 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman said Stanton had thought up many ideas for how he wanted the music to sound, and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult. Stanton wanted the whole score to be orchestral, but Newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard the ''Axiom'', and used electronics too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Daniel Schweiger|title=E-notes: Thomas Newman gives a chilling workout in 'Revolutionary Road' and some robotic impulses in 'WALL-E'|work=iF Magazine|date=January 19, 2009|url=http://ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=3193|accessdate=January 20, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102204821/http://ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=3193|archivedate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanton originally wanted to juxtapose the opening shots of space with 1930s French [[swing music]], but he saw ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (2003) and did not want to appear as if he were copying it.&lt;ref name=EW/&gt; Stanton then thought about the song "Put On Your Sunday Clothes" from ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', since he had portrayed the sidekick Barnaby Tucker in a 1980 high school production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oscar.com/oscarnight/winners/?pn=detail&amp;nominee=Wall-E%20-%20Best%20Animated%20Feature%20Film%20Nominee|title=Best Animated Feature Film Acceptance Speech|publisher=Oscar.com|accessdate=January 17, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226054230/http://oscar.com/oscarnight/winners/?pn=detail&amp;nominee=Wall-E%20-%20Best%20Animated%20Feature%20Film%20Nominee|archivedate=February 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton found that the song was about two naive young men looking for love, which was similar to WALL-E's own hope for companionship. [[Jim Reardon]] suggested WALL-E find the film on video, and Stanton included "It Only Takes a Moment" and the clip of the actors holding hands, because he wanted a visual way to show how WALL-E understands love and conveys it to EVE. ''Hello Dolly!'' composer [[Jerry Herman]] allowed the songs to be used without knowing what for; when he saw the film, he found its incorporation into the story "genius".&lt;ref name=EW&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2008/07/14/wall-e-how-he-found-hello-dolly/|title=WALL-E Meets Dolly!|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Chriss Willman|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, Newman's uncle [[Lionel Newman|Lionel]] worked on ''Hello, Dolly!''&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

Newman travelled to London to compose the end credits song "[[Down to Earth (Peter Gabriel song)|Down to Earth]]" with [[Peter Gabriel]], who was one of Stanton's favorite musicians. Afterwards, Newman rescored some of the film to include the song's composition, so it would not sound intrusive when played.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; [[Louis Armstrong]]'s rendition of "[[La Vie en rose]]" was used for a montage where WALL-E does not get EVE's attention on Earth. The script also specified using [[Bing Crosby]]'s "[[Stardust (song)|Stardust]]" for when the two robots dance around the ''Axiom'',&lt;ref name=screenplay&gt;{{cite news|url=http://disneystudiosawards.movies.go.com/wall-e_script.pdf|publisher=Disney|title=WALL-E screenplay|accessdate=June 1, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306103001/http://disneystudiosawards.movies.go.com/wall-e_script.pdf|archivedate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Newman asked if he could score the scene himself. A similar switch occurred for the sequence in which WALL-E attempts to wake EVE up through various means; originally, the montage would play with the instrumental version of "[[Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head]]", but Newman wanted to challenge himself and scored an original piece for the sequence.&lt;ref name=commentary&gt;[[Andrew Stanton]]'s Blu-ray and DVD audio commentary, 2008, Walt Disney Home Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
The film is recognized as [[social criticism]]. Katherine Ellison asserts that "Americans produce nearly 400 million tons of [[solid waste]] per year but recycle less than a third of it, according to a recent Columbia University study." [[Landfill]]s are filling up so quickly that the UK may run out of landfill space by the year 2017.&lt;ref name="Ellison, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Katherine|title=Talking Trash|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=October 2008|volume=6, No. 8|page=456|jstor=20440969|bibcode=1995SciAm.272c..24Y|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0395-24|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment and waste===
{{further information|Pollution}}
Because ''WALL-E'' overtly critiques [[consumerism]], it also critiques Disney's production values and aesthetic, without being too obvious.&lt;ref name="Murray and Heumann, 2009"/&gt; In the DVD commentary, Stanton said that he has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism. His answer was it was not; it was a way to answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself. Nevertheless, some critics have noted an incongruity between the pro-environmental and anti-consumerist messaging of the film, and the environmental impacts in the production and merchandising of the film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://governmentcheese.ca/~governme/writings/14-test Wall-E (2008) and the Ecological Footprint of Animation Production]&lt;/ref&gt;

In "WALL-E: from environmental adaption to sentimental [[nostalgia]]," Robin Murray and Joseph Heumann explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, for example [[Zippo lighter]]s, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items that we use out of necessity, are made sentimental through the lens of the bleak future of Earth. Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled Earth while playing "Put on Your Sunday Clothes", reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural world, as it is the sight and feeling of soil, and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE, that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.&lt;ref name="Murray and Heumann, 2009"/&gt;

Stanton describes the theme of the film as "irrational love defeats life's programming":&lt;ref name=newsarama2/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I realized the point I was trying to push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and figure out what the point of living was&amp;nbsp;... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built&amp;nbsp;... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of the whole point of the movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.&lt;ref name=newsarama2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Technology===
Stanton noted many commentators placed emphasis on the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because "that disconnection is going to be the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan L'Ecuyer |title=An Oscar shout-out |work=[[Gloucester Daily Times]] |url=http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120527035746/http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships.&lt;ref name=robot/&gt; Christian journalist [[Rod Dreher]] saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the ''Axiom'' has separated them from nature, making them "slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. "''WALL-E'' is not a [[Luddite]] film," he said. "It doesn't demonize technology. It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature—that it must be subordinate to human flourishing, and help move that along."&lt;ref name=dreher/&gt;

===Religion===

Dreher also noted this departure from classical Christian viewpoints, where Adam is ''cursed'' to labor, in that ''WALL-E'' argues hard work is what makes humans human. Dreher emphasized the false god parallels to BnL in a scene where a robot teaches infants "B is for Buy n Large, your very best friend", which he compared to modern corporations such as [[McDonald's]] creating [[brand loyalty]] in children.&lt;ref name="dreher"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2008/07/walle-aristotelian-crunchy-con.html | title="Wall-E": Aristotelian, crunchy con | work=[[Beliefnet]] | date=July 5, 2008 | accessdate=January 15, 2009 | author=Rod Dreher | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708131939/http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2008/07/walle-aristotelian-crunchy-con.html | archivedate=July 8, 2008 | deadurl=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megan Basham of ''[[World (magazine)|World]]'' magazine felt the film criticizes the pursuit of leisure, whereas WALL-E in his [[stewardship]] learns to truly appreciate God's creation.&lt;ref name=world/&gt;

During writing, a Pixar employee noted to [[Jim Reardon]] that EVE was reminiscent of the [[dove]] with the [[olive branch]] from the story of Noah's Ark, and the story was reworked with EVE finding a plant to return humanity from its voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; WALL-E himself has been compared to [[Prometheus]],&lt;ref name=comingsoon/&gt; [[Sisyphus]],&lt;ref name=dreher/&gt; and [[Butades]]: in an essay discussing WALL-E as representative of the artistic strive of Pixar itself, [[Hrag Vartanian]] compared WALL-E to Butades in a scene where the robot expresses his love for EVE by making a sculpture of her from spare parts. "The Ancient Greek tradition associates the birth of art with a Corinthian maiden who longing to preserve her lover's shadow traces it on the wall before he departed for war. The myth reminds us that art was born out of longing and often means more for the creator than the muse. In the same way Stanton and his Pixar team have told us a deeply personal story about their love of cinema and their vision for animation through the prism of all types of relationships."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hrag Vartanian|title="Wall-E" as a Return to the Promise of Animation|work=His blog|date=October 21, 2008|url=http://hragvartanian.com/2008/10/21/wall-e/|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Continuing a Pixar tradition, ''WALL-E'' was paired with a [[short subject|short film]] for its theatrical release, ''[[Presto (film)|Presto]]''.

===Critical response===
&lt;!-- Please note, when updating Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic ratings, you should also update the "accessdate" field within the citation tags to reflect the date on which you have updated them. --&gt;
The [[American Film Institute]] named ''WALL-E'' as one of the best films of 2008;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFI Awards 2008|url=http://www.afi.com/afiawards/AFIAwards08.aspx|publisher=American Film Institute|accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the jury rationale states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''WALL•E'' proves to this generation and beyond that the film medium's only true boundaries are the human imagination. Writer/director Andrew Stanton and his team have created a classic screen character from a metal trash compactor who rides to the rescue of a planet buried in the debris that embodies the broken promise of American life. Not since Chaplin's "Little Tramp" has so much story—so much emotion—been conveyed without words. When hope arrives in the form of a seedling, the film blossoms into one of the great screen romances as two robots remind audiences of the beating heart in all of us that yearns for humanity—and love—in the darkest of landscapes.

The review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 96% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 253 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10.

[[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named ''WALL-E'' his favorite film of 2008 (and later of the decade), noting the film succeeded in "connect[ing] with a huge audience" despite the main characters' lack of speech and "emotional signifiers like a mouth, eyebrows, shoulders, [and] elbows". It "evoke[d] the splendor of the movie past" and he also compared WALL-E and EVE's relationship to the chemistry of [[Spencer Tracy]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Corliss|title=Top 10 Movies|work=Time|date=December 9, 2008|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1855948_1863826_1863827,00.html|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics who named ''WALL-E'' their favorite film of 2008 included Tom Charity of [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Charity|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/12/31/best.2008/|title=The best (and worst) films of 2008|publisher=CNN|date=December 31, 2008|accessdate=January 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Phillips of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[A.

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film "Pixar's ninth consecutive wonder", saying it was imaginative yet straightforward. He said it pushed the boundaries of animation by balancing esoteric ideas with more immediately accessible ones, and that the main difference between the film and other science fiction projects rooted in an [[apocalypse]] was its optimism.&lt;ref name="var"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/VE1117937536.html |author=Todd McCarthy |title=WALL-E Review |work=Variety |date=June 26, 2008 |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805073200/http://www.variety.com/VE1117937536.html |archivedate=August 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' declared that ''WALL-E'' surpassed the achievements of Pixar's previous eight features and probably their most original film to date. He said it had the "heart, soul, spirit and romance" of the best [[silent film]]s. Honeycutt said the film's definitive stroke of brilliance was in using a mix of archive film footage and computer graphics to trigger WALL-E's romantic leanings. He praised Burtt's sound design, saying "If there is such a thing as an aural sleight of hand, this is it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/wall-e-review-2008-movie-1016979 |title=WALL-E |author=Kirk Honeycutt |date=June 25, 2008 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630095618/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?JSESSIONID=stXDLjWG25pv31dwl2yynPgffjhWyvSk96w52TwNp9jZphdLSkRG%21-209288430&amp;&amp;rid=11329 |archivedate=June 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' named ''WALL-E'' "an enthralling animated film, a visual wonderment, and a decent science-fiction story" and said the scarcity of dialogue would allow it to "cross language barriers" in a manner appropriate to the global theme, and noted it would appeal to adults and children. He praised the animation, describing the color palette as "bright and cheerful [...] and a little bit realistic", and that Pixar managed to generate a "curious" regard for the WALL-E, comparing his "rusty and hard-working and plucky" design favorably to more obvious attempts at creating "lovable" lead characters. He said ''WALL-E'' was concerned with ideas rather than spectacle, saying it would trigger stimulating "little thoughts for the younger viewers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080626/REVIEWS/963071290 | title=WALL-E review | author=Roger Ebert | work=Chicago Sun-Times | date=June 26, 2008 | accessdate=June 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He named it as one of his twenty favorite films of 2008 and argued it was "the best science-fiction movie in years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Roger Ebert|title=The best films of 2008... and there were a lot of them|date=December 5, 2008|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/the-best-films-of-2008-and-there-were-a-lot-of-them|accessdate=December 9, 2008 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was interpreted as tackling a topical, [[ecology|ecologically]]-minded agenda,&lt;ref name="rt"/&gt; though McCarthy said it did so with a lightness of touch that granted the viewer the ability to accept or ignore the message.&lt;ref name="var"/&gt; [[Kyle Smith]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'', wrote that by depicting future humans as "a flabby mass of peabrained idiots who are literally too fat to walk", ''WALL-E'' was darker and more cynical than any major Disney feature film he could recall. He compared the humans to the patrons of [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney's Parks and Resorts]], adding, "I'm also not sure I've ever seen a major corporation spend so much money to issue an insult to its customers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kylesmithonline.com/?p=1319 | title=Disney's "Wall-E": A $170 Million Art Film | author=Kyle Smith | publisher=kylesmithonline.com | date=June 26, 2008 | accessdate=July 1, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511055731/http://kylesmithonline.com/?p=1319 | archive-date=May 11, 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maura Judkis of ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' questioned whether this depiction of "frighteningly obese humans" would resonate with children and make them prefer to "play outside rather than in front of the computer, to avoid a similar fate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/fresh-greens/2008/6/30/will-wall-e-make-us-greener.html | title=Will 'WALL-E' Make Us Greener? | author=Maura Judkis | work=U.S. News &amp; World Report | date=June 30, 2008 | accessdate=July 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation led to criticism of the film by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] commentators such as [[Glenn Beck]], and contributors to ''[[National Review|National Review Online]]'' including [[Shannen W.

Patrick J. Ford of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' said ''WALL-E''{{'}}s conservative critics missed lessons in the film that he felt appealed to traditional conservatism. He argued that the mass [[consumerism]] in the film was not shown to be a product of [[big business]], but of too close a tie between big business and [[big government]]: "The government unilaterally provided its citizens with everything they needed, and this lack of variety led to Earth's downfall." Responding to Coffin's claim that the film points out the evils of mankind, Ford argued the only evils depicted were those that resulted from losing touch with our own humanity and that fundamental conservative representations such as the farm, the family unit, and wholesome entertainment were in the end held aloft by the human characters. He concluded, "By steering conservative families away from ''WALL-E'', these commentators are doing their readers a great disservice."&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Patrick J.

Director [[Terry Gilliam]] praised the film as "A stunning bit of work. The scenes on what was left of planet Earth are just so beautiful: one of the great silent movies. And the most stunning artwork! It says more about ecology and society than any live action film—all the people on their loungers floating around, brilliant stuff. Their social comment was so smart and right on the button."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/film/features/show-feature/8837/ Time Out's 50 greatest animated films: part 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011205928/http://www.timeout.com/film/features/show-feature/8837/ |date=October 11, 2009 }}.

Archaeologists have commented on the themes of human evolution that the film explores.&lt;ref name="marwick"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ben Marwick | title = Self-image, the long view and archaeological engagement with film: an animated case study | journal=World Archaeology | publisher=[[Routledge]] |year = 2010 | url=http://faculty.washington.edu/bmarwick/PDFs/Marwick_2010_WA_Wall-E.pdf | doi= 10.1080/00438243.2010.497386/  |volume= 42 |issue= 3|pages= 394–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Marwick has written how the character of WALL-E resembles an archaeologist with his methodical collection and classification of quotidian human artefacts. He is shown facing a typological dilemma of classifying a [[spork]] as either a fork or spoon, and his nostalgic interest in the human past further demonstrated by his attachment to repeated viewings of the 1969 film [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|''Hello, Dolly!'']]. Marwick notes that the film features major human evolutionary transitions such as obligate bipedalism (captain of the spaceship struggles with the autopilot to gain control of the vessel) and the invention of agriculture, as part of watershed moments in the story of the film. According to Marwick, one prominent message of the film "appears to be that the envelopment by technology that the humans in ''Wall-E'' experience paradoxically results in physical and cultural devolution." Scholars such as [[Ian Tattersall]] and [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] have similarly discussed scenarios where elements of modern technology (such as medicine) may have caused human evolution to slow or stop.

==Robotic recreations==
In 2012, Mike McMaster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/i-cant-believe-how-human-this-wall-e-robot-seems-1034289678|title=I Can't Believe How Human This Wall-E Robot Seems|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American robotics hobbyist, began working on his own model of WALL-E. The final product was built with more moving parts than the WALL-E which roams around [[Disneyland]]. McMaster's four-foot robot made an appearance at the [[Walt Disney Family Museum]] and was featured during the opening week of Tested.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomsguide.com/us/technology-robot-walle-mcmaster,news-17477.html Pixar's Wall-E Brought to Life], tomsguide.com&lt;/ref&gt; a project headed up by [[Jamie Hyneman]] and [[Adam Savage]] of  ''[[MythBusters]]''. Since WALL-E's creation, Mike and the popular robot have made dozens of appearances at various events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actuatorzone.com/Blog/post/2013/09/17/Mike-Sennas-Wall-E-Project-Using-Linear-Actuators-from-Progressive-Automations|title=Mike Senna's Wall-E Project|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012022114/http://www.actuatorzone.com/Blog/post/2013/09/17/Mike-Sennas-Wall-E-Project-Using-Linear-Actuators-from-Progressive-Automations|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
