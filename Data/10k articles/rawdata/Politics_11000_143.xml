The '''9-12 Project''' (alternatively '''9/12 Project''', '''912 Project''') was a group created by American television and radio personality [[Glenn Beck]]. It was launched on the March 13, 2009, episode of ''[[Glenn Beck (TV program)|Glenn Beck]]'', the eponymous talk show on [[Fox News Channel]]. A website was launched to promote the group, and several local 9-12 groups formed soon after in cities throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="Politico Vogul"&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenneth P. |last=Vogul |title=Beck to announce ‘big plan’ for 2010 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/20091120/pl_politico/29776_1|newspaper=Politico |publisher=news.yahoo.com |date=November 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Beck, the purpose of the project was "to bring us all back to the place we were on September 12, 2001 ... we were not obsessed with red states, blue states or political parties. We were united as Americans, standing together to protect the values and principles of the greatest nation ever created."&lt;ref&gt;[citation 3, Standard Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; 9-12 represents the date following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, and "9 Principles" and "12 Values" that Beck believes represent the principles and values shared by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the912project.com/the-912-2/mission-statement/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the [[Tea Party movement]] was part of the 9-12 Project serving as a sponsor for the [[Taxpayer March on Washington]] on September 12, 2009.&lt;ref name="Politico Vogul"/&gt; The 9-12 Project activists claim not to identify with any major political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705331029/Pignanelli--Webb-Anti-government-protests-common-in-US-history.html|title=Frank Pignanelli &amp; LaVarr Webb: Anti-government protests common in U.S. history|first=Frank Pignanelli &amp; LaVarr|last=Webb|date=September 20, 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 9 Principles and 12 Values ==
The name "9-12" symbolized both the day after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]] (written as September 12, or 9-12), and the project's "nine principles and twelve values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the912project.com/the-912-2/|work=the912project.com|title=Nine Principles, Twelve Values|accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the website, the 9 Principles and 12 Values were derived from the principles of the Founding Fathers:

::At the origin of America, our Founding Fathers built this country on 28 powerful principles. These principles were culled from all over the world and from centuries of great thinkers. We have distilled the original 28 down to the 9 basic principles.&lt;ref name="912 Mission Statement"&gt;[http://www.the912project.com/the-912-2/mission-statement/], The 9-12 Project: Mission Statement&lt;/ref&gt;

The website listed the 9 Principles, accompanied by quotations from [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The 9 Principles were:

#America is good.
#I believe in God and He is the center of my life.
#I must always try to be a more honest person than I was yesterday.
#The family is sacred. My spouse and I are the ultimate authority, not the government.
#If you break the law you pay the penalty. Justice is blind and no one is above it.
#I have a right to [[life, liberty and pursuit of happiness]], but there is no guarantee of equal results.
#I work hard for what I have and I will share it with who I want to. Government cannot force me to be charitable.
#It is not un-American for me to disagree with authority or to share my personal opinion.
#The government works for me. I do not answer to them, they answer to me.

The 12 Values were:

#[[Honesty]]
#[[Reverence (attitude)|Reverence]]
#[[Hope]]
#[[Frugality|Thrift]]
#[[Humility]]
#[[charity (virtue)|Charity]]
#[[Sincerity]]
#[[Moderation]]
#[[Hard work]]
#[[Courage]]
#[[Personal responsibility|Personal Responsibility]]
#[[Gratitude]] (originally [[Friendship]]){{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==History==
[[File:Pennsylvania Avenue - Tea Party.jpg|thumb|Protesters walking towards the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] during the [[Taxpayer March on Washington]].]]
[[File:Glenn Beck fans - Tea Party protest.jpg|thumb|A group of protesters hold signs praising Beck at the [[Taxpayer March on Washington]].]]
The 9-12 Project was created as the result of Beck's "We Surround Them" campaign, a series of segments and specials on Beck's [[Glenn Beck (TV program)|television program]] in early 2009 which purported to bring back government [[accountability]].&lt;ref name="hatties"&gt;{{cite news |first=Earlesha |last=Butner |title=Demanding accountability |url=http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/article/20090913/NEWS01/909130346/Demanding-accountability |newspaper=Hattiesburg American |publisher=hattiesburgamerican.com |date=September 13, 2009 |accessdate=September 22, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers were asked to incorporate these values first in their personal lives, then expect them of those they elected to office and holding the elected accountable. At one point during the campaign, viewers were asked to submit pictures if they believed at least seven of the nine founding principles and felt they were alone in believing these principles. Many of the pictures were used to form a [[collage]] that once lined one of the walls in Glenn Beck's [[Fox News Channel]] studio.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The 9-12 Project grew out of that campaign, as a result of the original call Beck took on his nationally syndicated talk radio show, from "Ed" of [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. During that phone call in late January, 2009, "Ed" said that he felt "outnumbered" (as a true conservative in today's political battles). Beck told him that he would figure out a way to prove to him that he isn't alone, and that "they," the powers that be, don't surround "us", the American people, but rather, "We Surround Them!"

Following the Taxpayer March on Washington on September 12, 2009, Beck introduced a campaign for the 9-12 project called "Re-found America". The campaign aims to find 56 Re-Founders, who are [[U.S. Congress|Congressional]] politicians who agree to stand against [[political corruption|corruption]] and abuses of power, and become [[whistle blowers]], exposing the evidence of corruption.&lt;ref name="refound"&gt;{{cite web |title=Refound America |url=http://www.the912project.com/take-action-get-involved/re-found-america/ |date= |work=9/12 Project |publisher=the912project.com |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, the News section on the 9-12 Project website had not been updated since February 2014, and by June 2017 the 9-12 Project Website itself was no longer extant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the912-project.com/news-events/|website=9-12 Project Website News Page|title=News &amp; Events|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview before the 2016 US presidential election, Beck stated that while the 9-12 Project had often been conflated with the [[Tea Party movement]], it had actually been set up in opposition to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glenn Beck: A Changed Man?

==Local organizations==
Individuals in a number of locations in the [[United States]] formed organizations and chapters based with the 9-12 Project.&lt;ref name="norwinstar"&gt;{{cite news|first=Brad |last=Pederson |title=Local 9.12 project picks up steam |url=http://www.yournorwin.com/norwinstar/article/local-912-project-picks-steam |newspaper=Norwin Star |publisher=YourNorwin.com |date=October 1, 2009 |accessdate=October 9, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="standardjournal"&gt;{{cite news |first=Nate |last=Sunderland |title=Marchers say no to big government |url=http://www.rexburgstandardjournal.com/articles/2009/09/15/news/26.txt |newspaper=Standard Journal |publisher=Standard Journal Online |date=September 15, 2009 |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftworth"&gt;{{cite news |first=Aman |last=Batheja |title=912 Project Fort Worth protests the federal government |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/topstories/story/1608912.html |newspaper=Star-Telegram |publisher=star-telegram.com |date=September 12, 2009 |accessdate=September 22, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cherokeeco" /&gt; The aim of such groups was to get the public active in keeping elected officials accountable to voters and taxpayers.&lt;ref name="norwinstar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="standardjournal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite news |title=Clark to address 9.12 Project's mayoral candidate forum |url=http://www.greeleytribune.com/article/20090919/NEWS/909199983/-1/rss06 |newspaper=Greeley Tribune |publisher=GreeleyTribune.com |date=September 19, 2009 |accessdate=October 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718180311/http://www.greeleytribune.com/article/20090919/NEWS/909199983/-1/rss06 |archivedate=July 18, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[Murphy, North Carolina]], a meeting of self-proclaimed 9-12 Project members was held on August 29, 2009 "to plan how to elect their own representatives to the [[U.S. House]] and decrease the size and control of the federal government over the lives of American people".&lt;ref name="cherokeeco"&gt;{{cite news|first=Dwight |last=Otwell |title=9/12 event draws big attendance |url=http://www.cherokeescout.com/articles/2009/09/01/news/doc4a9d879be7708517445245.txt |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119114620/http://www.cherokeescout.com/articles/2009/09/01/news/doc4a9d879be7708517445245.txt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 19, 2013 |date=September 1, 2009 |newspaper=Cherokee Scout |publisher=cherokeescout.com |accessdate=September 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was attended by "more than 325 people".&lt;ref name="cherokeeco" /&gt; Another event, in Salt Lake City, [[Utah]], on September 12, 2009 (9-12-09), featured several speakers, from activists to conservative  public officials. Over 2,000 activists were reportedly in attendance&lt;ref name="2,000 rally in Utah against federal policies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/user/comments/705329688/2000-rally-in-Utah-against-federal-policies.html|title=Comments about '2,000 rally in Utah against federal policies' - Deseret News|first=Lana|last=Groves|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National events==

"9/12ers", as members of the 9/12 movement were sometimes called, also attended various [[Tea Party protests]]; among those are the [[Tax Day]] protests on April 15, 2009, the July 4, 2009 [[American Independence Day|Independence Day]] Tea Party protests, and the September 12, 2009 [[Taxpayer March on Washington]].&lt;ref name="saltlake"&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Burger |title=Glenn Beck's '912 Project' draws a crowd to Capitol |url=http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_13323855|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |publisher=sltrib.org |date=September 13, 2009 |accessdate=October 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also had a presence at other September 12, 2009 Tea Party protests in cities all across America, from [[Tampa]] to [[Salt Lake City]] to [[Fort Worth]].&lt;ref name="ftworth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="saltlake" /&gt;

Members of certain 9-12 Project chapters held a nationwide protest in front of various [[news media]] buildings on October 17, 2009. Dubbed "Operation: Can You Hear Us Now", the project was started with the aim of protesting against a [[American liberal|liberal]] bias in the [[mainstream media]], and called for more honest reporting in [[journalism]].&lt;ref name="wyff4"&gt;{{Cite news  | title = Group Holds Nationwide Protest Of TV Stations  | work = WYFF 4  | date = October 18, 2009  | url = http://www.wyff4.com/news/21331154/detail.html  | accessdate = October 23, 2009  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091022102830/http://www.wyff4.com/news/21331154/detail.html  | archivedate = October 22, 2009  | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WFMZ"&gt;{{Cite news  | title = Protesters Accuse Newspaper, Other Media Outlets Of Bias | work = 69 News WFMZ-TV  | date = October 18, 2009  | url = http://wfmz.com/view/?id=1284837&amp;title=Protesters%20Accuse%20Newspaper,%20Other%20Media%20Outlets%20Of%20Bias  | accessdate = October 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allentown"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Daniel |last=Sheehan |title=Protesters assail media for perceived leftward lean |work=The Morning Call |date=October 18, 2009 |url=http://www.mcall.com/news/all-a20_5protest.7057960oct18,0,3460654.story |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022153327/http://www.mcall.com/news/all-a20_5protest.7057960oct18%2C0%2C3460654.story |archivedate=October 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One 9-12 member from [[Long Island]] said of the reasons behind this event that, "...news media are not the fourth branch of government.  We the people are.  News media are the people's established institutions designed to facilitate the flow of information not just from government to the people, but from the people – a self-governing people – to the government we employ." {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

An '''Ahdname''', '''achtiname''' or '''ahidnâme''' (meaning the "Bill of Oath") is a type of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[charter]] commonly referred to as a [[Capitulation (treaty)|capitulation]]. During the [[early modern period]], the Ottoman Empire called it an Ahidname-i-Humayun or an imperial pledge and the Ahdname functioned as an [[official]] [[Treaty|agreement]] between the Empire and various European states.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Daniel. “Negotiating with the Renaissance State: the Ottoman Empire and the New Diplomacy.” in The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire. Eds. Virginia Aksan and Daniel Goffman. Cambridge: Cambridge (Page 63). 
.(Page 64).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
{{Taxation in the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}
The Ahdname still requires much detailed study regarding its historical background and about what type of [[document]] it was. What is known however is that the Ahdname was an important part of Ottoman [[diplomacy]] in that it set forth a [[contractual agreement]] between two states, usually between the Ottoman Empire and European nations, like [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Daniel. The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002 (Page 187).&lt;/ref&gt; It was influential in the way it helped to structure society and maintained the agreements made between nation states.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Daniel. The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002.(Page 187).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Venice, Adhnames were also used to maintain [[political]] and [[Commerce|commercial]] links with the Ottoman Empire. This agreement between Venice and the Ottoman Empire ensured that Italian [[merchants]] were protected during their commerce trips into the Empire. These Ahdnames also provided a certain level of physical protection as they helped provide Italian merchants with [[hospice]].&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Daniel. The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002.(Page 193).&lt;/ref&gt; After all, Venice was very aware that in order to protect the strength of their commerce, it was imperative to remain to in good standing with the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Daniel. “Negotiating with the Renaissance State: the Ottoman Empire and the New Diplomacy.” in The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire. Eds. Virginia Aksan and Daniel Goffman. Cambridge: Cambridge (Page 63).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th Century, Venice aimed its policy towards the preservation of peaceful relations with the Ottomans. After the 1453 Conquest of [[Constantinople]], the Ottoman Empire had become [[Europe]]'s most powerful force. As a result, Venice had to tread carefully in order not to instigate any conflicts. Ahdnames became a useful tool in communication between the two competing forces.&lt;ref&gt;Theunissen, Hans. Ottoman-Venetian Diplomatics: The Ahd-names. 1998. (Page 1-3).&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the Ahdnames that the Ottoman Empire and Venice drafted always occurred after a [[war]] between the two, such as the two wars they were embroiled in during 1503 and 1540. The remaining treaties were simply edited for better quality and protection willingly by both the Empire and Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Theunissen, Hans. Ottoman-Venetian Diplomatics: The Ahd-names. 1998. (Page 249).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of the Ahdname==
The Ottoman Ahdname was typically broken down into several sections. Every Ahdname usually had several parts called the erkan (sing. rukn), which were deemed to be the [[wikt:internal|internal]] structuring of the document.&lt;ref name="Theunissen, Hans 1998. Page 188"&gt;Theunissen, Hans. Ottoman-Venetian Diplomatics: The Ahd-names. 1998. (Page 188).&lt;/ref&gt;  Not every Ahdname had similar erkan however. Instead the text was found between two [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocols]] calls the introductory protocol and the final protocol or [[eschatocol]].&lt;ref name="Theunissen, Hans 1998. Page 188"/&gt;

The introductory protocol, main text, and eschatocol consisted of the several erkan:
*The [[invocation]], where the name of [[Allah|God]] appeared
*The ''intitulatio'', where the name and rank of the person to whom the document was meant for appeared. His official [[title]] and [[Ranks of nobility and peerage|rank]] also appeared.
*The ''inscriptio'', where addresses of the person to whom the document was issued for appeared.
*The ''salutatio'', where the formal greeting appeared.&lt;ref name="Theunissen, Hans 1998. Page 188"/&gt;

Then, the Ahdname would continue on with the main text of the document and would include the following erkan:
*The ''expositio-narratio'', where an explanation for the document is issued and any other events are described in detail. 
*The ''dispositio'', where a decision that has been made is detailed. 
*The ''sanctio'', which is both a confirming of the dispositio as well as a warning. At times it also functioned as an oath.
*The ''corroboratio'', which was an authentication of the document in question. It was an examination of the validity of the Ahdname.
*The ''datatio'', which was the date of which the document was issued to its receiver.
*The ''locatio'', which was the place in which the document was issued.
*The ''legitimatio'',  which was again another form of [[authentication]] of the document. 
 	
Often, the authenticator was the [[Sultan]] or the [[Grand Vizier]] or simply a seal. This is the final part of the Ahdname to be written, so it is part of the eschatocol.&lt;ref&gt;Theunissen, Hans. Ottoman-Venetian Diplomatics: The Ahd-names. 1998. (Page 188-189).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note, that while this was the general makeup of the Ahdnames, it was not always stringently followed as such.

Historian, Daniel Goffman, writes that those that composed Ahdnames seemed to have, ''"drawn upon Islamic, sultanic, and even local legal codes as the situations warranted."&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Daniel. “Negotiating with the Renaissance State: the Ottoman Empire and the New Diplomacy.” in The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire.

'''Andeel''' is an [[Egypt]]ian cartoonist. His work has come into the forefront since the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]].

==Biography==
Andeel was born in [[Kafr al-Sheikh]] in 1986. Andeel would often visit [[Cairo]] with his parents despite not living there. He says he loved Cairo from a young age and decided to move there when he was seventeen years old after he finished high school. His first job was with ''[[Al Gael]]'' newspaper. A year later, he moved to ''Al Dostour'' newspaper where he worked under veteran cartoonist Amr Selim. From there, Andeel moved to another privately owned paper, ''Al Masry Al Youm'', and cofounded its quarterly comics magazine, ''Tok-Tok''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of Andeel: Cartoonist, autodidact, funny man|date=24 March 2014|first=Jahd|last=Khalil|website=Mada Masr|url=http://madamasr.com/content/profile-andeel-cartoonist-autodidact-funny-man}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andeel liked cartoons as a kid. His father showed him the work of Egyptian cartoonist Salah Jaheen, which he says has had a huge impact on his work. Many of the work Andeel was exposed to prior to Jaheen was foreign, so seeing Jaheen’s work about Egypt was a motivating factor to his getting involved in cartooning. Before becoming a prominent cartoonist, however, Andeel tried his luck at script writing and standup comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andeel - أنديل|author=Medrar.TV|date=24 March 2014|website=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM8rsuGjOYw#t=678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Andeel's work is based on political satire.
His uncle told him that his paternal grandfather was a filmmaker who made a feature film called “Horses,” which he took to the Berlin Film Festival. Due to racism it was overlooked for the big prize though it clearly deserved it, and on the boat back to Egypt he threw the only copy of the film overboard and retired from cinema. Knowledge of this outrage compelled Andeel to move to Cairo and become a professional cartoonist at a very early age, as well as making short films (such as “Who Knows?”, a psychedelic film noir set in the wild west), writing TV scripts, designing newspapers, co-founding “Tok Tok” comics magazine, launching “Radhio Kafril Sheikh el Habeeba,” and using Facebook a lot. He is studying for a certificate in social work. In 2012 he got married to a really great woman.

[[File:18990910 Edouard Drumont and Libre Parole.jpg|thumb|Drumont and his newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]'' (Free Speech), in 1899]]
The '''Antisemitic League of France''' ({{lang-fr|Ligue antisémitique de France}}) was founded in 1889 by the journalist [[Edouard Drumont]]. First known under the name of {{lang|fr|Ligue nationale antisémitique de France}} (National Antisemitic League of France) or {{lang|fr|Ligue antisémite française}} (French Antisemitic League), this [[nationalist]] league was particularly active during the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. Beside spreading [[anti-Semitic]] propaganda, the League was also [[anti-Masonry]] and [[anti-communism|anti-Communist]]. It had as general delegates [[Jacques de Biez]]. [[Jules Guérin]] was an active member of it. The League was located on rue Lepic in [[Paris]].

Its 1889 foundation was inspired by the success of Drumont's antisemitic pamphlet ''[[La France juive]]'' (1886), and also by the [[Boulangist crisis]]. It was supported by newspapers such as Drumont's ''[[La Libre Parole]]''; Jules Guérin's French weekly ''[[L'Antijuif]] ([[:fr:L'Antijuif|fr]])'' (Paris, 1896-1902); the daily ''[[La Cocarde]] ([[:fr:La Cocarde|fr]])'' (1888-1907) founded by [[Georges de Labruyère]] ([[:fr:Georges de Labruyère|fr]]) and edited September 1894 - March 1895 by [[Maurice Barrès]]; [[Henri Rochefort]]'s ''[[L'Intransigeant]]''; and the Catholic newspaper ''[[La Croix]]''.

Beside propaganda, the League also organized antisemitic demonstrations and provoked some riots, a method later generalized by the [[far-right leagues in France]]. It denounced the [[Panama scandals]], took side against [[Alfred Dreyfus]] and spread [[conspiracy theories]] concerning the Masonry's alleged activities in the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].

After a disagreement between Drumont and Guérin in 1899, the League became, under the direction of Guérin, the [[Grand Occident de France]], still antisemitic but even more anti-Masonic, the name itself being a reaction against the Masonic [[Grand Orient de France]]. It was thereafter essentially linked to Guérin's newspaper, ''L'Antijuif''. The League progressively disappeared after the "[[Fort Chabrol]]" affair and the arrest of Guérin. After an initial surge during the Dreyfus Affair, far right leagues appeared again during the [[interwar period]].

The '''Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus''' ({{lang-el|Αὐτόνομος Δημοκρατία τῆς Βορείου Ἠπείρου|translit=Aftónomos Dimokratía tis Voreíou Ipeírou}}) was a short-lived, self-governing entity founded in the aftermath of the [[Balkan Wars]] on February 28, 1914 by Greeks living in southern [[Albania]] ([[Northern Epirotes]]).

The area, known as [[Northern Epirus]] (Βόρειος Ήπειρος) to Greeks and with a substantial Greek population, was taken by the [[Greek Army]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[First Balkan War]] (1912–1913). The [[Treaty of London (1913)#Terms|Protocol of Florence]], however, had assigned it to the newly established Albanian state. This decision was rejected by the local Greeks, and as the Greek army withdrew to the new border, an autonomous government was set up at [[Gjirokastër|Argyrokastron]] ({{lang-el|Αργυρόκαστρον}}, today Gjirokastër), under the leadership of [[Georgios Christakis-Zografos]], a distinguished local Greek politician and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and with tacit support from [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=Boeckh114/&gt;

In May, the autonomy was confirmed by the [[Great Powers]] with the [[Protocol of Corfu]]. The agreement ensured that the region would have its own administration, recognized the rights of the local population and provided for self-government under nominal Albanian sovereignty. However, it was never implemented because in August the Albanian government collapsed. The Greek Army reoccupied the area in October 1914 following the outbreak of [[World War I]]. It was planned that Northern Epirus would  be ceded to Greece following the war, but withdrawal of Italian support and Greece's defeat in the [[Asia Minor Campaign]] resulted in its final cession to Albania in November 1921.&lt;ref name=Miller543&gt;Miller 1966: 543–44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:EpireDuNOrd1913.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ethnographic map of Northern Epirus in 1913, presented by Greece at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]]]]

===Northern Epirus and the Balkan Wars===
{{See also|First Balkan War #Epirus front|l1=Epirus front (First Balkan War)}}

In March 1913, during the First Balkan War, the Greek Army entered [[Ioannina]] after breaching the Ottoman fortifications at [[Battle of Bizani|Bizani]], and soon afterwards advanced further north.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory C. Ference, ed. Chronology of 20th Century Eastern European History. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Himarë]] had already been under Greek control since 5 November 1912, after a local [[Himariote]], Gendarmerie Major [[Spyros Spyromilios]], led a successful [[Himara revolt of 1912|uprising]] that met no initial resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Kondis 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?ei=gKMkTd6yD4zEswb86KjLAg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=tEloAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=chimara%2Bspyromelios&amp;q=%22Venizelos+that+Valona+should+be+captured%22#search_anchor p. 93]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, Greek armed forces controlled most of the historical region of [[Epirus]], from the [[Ceraunian mountains]] along the Ionian coast to [[Lake Prespa]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Schurman 1916: "During the first war the Greeks had occupied Epirus or southern Albania as far north as a line drawn from a point a little above Khimara on the coast due
east toward Lake Presba, so that the cities of Tepeleni and Koritza were included in the Greek area."&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the Albanian [[National Renaissance of Albania|independence movement]] gathered momentum. On 28 November 1912 in [[Vlorë]], [[Ismail Qemali]] [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|declared Albania's independence]], and a [[Provisional Government of Albania|provisional government]] was soon formed that exercised its authority only in the immediate area of Vlorë. Elsewhere, the Ottoman general [[Essad Pasha Toptani|Essad Pasha]] formed the [[Republic of Central Albania]] at [[Durrës]],&lt;ref&gt;Stickney 1924: 51&lt;/ref&gt; while conservative Albanian tribesmen still hoped for an Ottoman ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Winnifrith 2002: 130&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the area that would form the Albanian state was occupied at this time, by the Greeks in the south and the Serbs in the north.&lt;ref name="Miller518"&gt;Miller 1966: 518&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ottoman census, conducted in 1908, counted 128,000 [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]] and 95,000 [[Muslims]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Nußberger Angelika |author2=Wolfgang Stoppel |title=Minderheitenschutz im östlichen Europa (Albanien)|year=2001|journal=|volume=|publisher=Universität Köln |language=German|page=11|place=|url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/jur-fak/ostrecht/minderheitenschutz/Vortraege/Albanien/Albanien_Stoppel.pdf|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Orthodox population, an estimated 30,000 to 47,000 spoke Greek exclusively. The rest of the Orthodox community spoke an Albanian [[patois]] at home, but was literate only in Greek, which was used in cultural, trading and economic activities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Moreover, they expressed a strong pro-Greek feeling, and were the first to support the following breakaway autonomist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman|first=Bernard |title=Balkan Background |publisher=READ BOOKS |language=|year=2007 |pages=262–263 |ref=|isbn=978-1-4067-5374-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ntUESPqqnDgC&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering these conditions, loyalty in Northern Epirus to an Albanian government competing in an anarchy, whose leaders were mostly Muslim, could not be guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;Winnifrith 2002: 130 "...in Northern Epirus loyalty to an Albania with a variety of Muslim leaders competing in anarchy cannot have been strong".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delineation of the Greek–Albanian border===
[[File:Albanian caricature 1913.gif|thumb|right|Albanian caricature shows Albania defending itself from neighboring countries—Montenegro (monkey), Greece (leopard) and Serbia (snake)—as a woman defending herself from animals, saying: "Get away from me! Bloodsucking beasts!" |alt=A caricature showing a woman defending herself from a monkey, leopard and snake. The woman's right forearm reads [[Shkodër]] and the left reads [[Janina]].]]
The concept of an independent Albanian state was supported by the Great European Powers, particularly [[Austro-Hungary]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Schurman 1916: 'This new kingdom was called into being by the voice of the European concert at the demand of Austria-Hungary supported by Italy.'&lt;/ref&gt; Both powers were seeking to control Albania, which, in the words of Italian Foreign Minister [[Tommaso Tittoni]], would give whichever managed this "incontestable supremacy in the Adriatic". The Serbian possession of [[Shkodër]] and the possibility of the Greek border running a few miles south of Vlore was therefore strongly resisted by these states.&lt;ref name="Miller518" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chase 2007: 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1913, an International Commission of the European Powers convened to determine the boundary between Greece and Albania. The delegates of the commission aligned themselves into two camps: those of [[Italy]] and [[Austro-Hungary]] insisted that the Northern Epirus districts were Albanian, while those of the [[Triple Entente]] (the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]) took the view that although the older generations in some villages spoke [[Albanian language|Albanian]], the younger generation was [[Greeks|Greek]] in intellectual outlook, sentiment, and aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Stickney 1924: 38&lt;/ref&gt; Under Italian and Austro-Hungarian pressure, the commission determined that the region of Northern Epirus would be ceded to Albania.&lt;ref&gt;Stickney 1924: 32–33 "In view of the opposition of the part of the Dual monarchy...showed his irrecontiliation."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protocol of Florence===
With the delineation of the exact boundaries of the new state, the region of Northern Epirus was awarded to Albania under the terms of the Protocol of Florence, signed on 17 December 1913. On 21 February 1914, the ambassadors of the Great Powers delivered a note to the Greek government asking for the Greek army's evacuation of the area. Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] acceded to this in hopes of a favorable solution to Greece's other outstanding problem: the recognition of Greek sovereignty over the islands of the [[North Aegean|North Eastern Aegean]].&lt;ref&gt;Kitromilides 2008: 150–151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/8C729CB1-E98E-4475-B71B-22B9A8B54572/0/1914_greece_note.doc Greek ministry of Foreign Affairs. Note of the Great Powers to Greece.] It concerned the decision of the Powers to cede irrevocably to Greece all the Aegean islands already occupied by the latter (with the exception of Imbros, Tenedos and Castellorizo) on the date on which Greek troops would evacuate the parts of Northern Epirus awarded to Albania by the Florence Protocol.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declaration of Independence===

This turn of events was highly unpopular among the pro-Greek party in the area. The pro-Greek Epirotes felt betrayed by the Greek government, which had done nothing to support them with firearms. Additionally, the gradual withdrawal of the Greek army would enable Albanian forces to take control of the region. To avert this possibility, the Epirotes decided to declare their own separate political identity and self-governance.&lt;ref name="Kondis 1976: 124"&gt;Kondis 1976: 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schurman 1916: "It is little wonder that the Greeks of Epirus feel outraged by the destiny which the European Powers have imposed upon them... Nor is it surprising that since Hellenic armies have evacuated northern Epirus in conformity with the decree of the Great Powers, the inhabitants of the district, all the way from Santi Quaranta to Koritza, are declaring their independence and fighting the Albanians who attempt to bring them under the yoke."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgios Christakis-Zografos]], a distinguished Epirote statesman from [[Lunxhëri]] (gr. ''Lioúntzi'') and former Greek foreign minister, took the initiative and discussed the situation with local representatives in a "Panepirotic Council". Consequently, on 28 February 1914, the Autonomous&lt;ref name="autonomos"&gt;The Greek term ''[[:wiktionary:αὐτονομία|autonomos]]'' can mean either "independent" or "autonomous".&lt;/ref&gt; Republic of Northern Epirus was declared in [[Gjirokastër]] (gr. ''Argyrókastron'') and a provisional government, with Christakis-Zografos as president, formed to support the state's objectives.&lt;ref name="Kondis 1976: 124"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Stickney 1924: 42&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech on 2 March,&lt;ref name=Boeckh114&gt;Boeckh 1996: 114&lt;/ref&gt; Christakis-Zografos stated that the aspirations of the Northern Epirotes had been totally ignored, and that the Great Powers had not only rejected their becoming autonomous within the Albanian state but also refused to give guarantees regarding their fundamental human rights.&lt;ref name="Kondis 1976: 124" /&gt; Zografos concluded his speech by stating that the Northern Epirotes would not accept the destiny the Powers had imposed upon them:&lt;ref&gt;Pyrrhus Ruches.

{{cquote|Because of this inalienable right of each people, the Great Powers' desire to create for Albania a valid and respected title of dominion over our land and to subjugate us is powerless before the fundamentals of divine and human justice. Neither does Greece have the right to continue in occupation of our territory merely to betray it against our will to a foreign tyrant.&lt;br /&gt; Free of all ties, unable to live united under these conditions with Albania, Northern Epirus proclaims its independence and calls upon its citizens to undergo every sacrifice to defend the integrity of the territory and its liberties from any attack whatsoever.}}

The flag of the new state was a variant of the Greek [[Flag of Greece|national flag]], consisting of a white cross centered upon the blue background surmounted by the imperial [[double-headed eagle|Byzantine eagle]] in black.&lt;ref&gt;Ruches 1965: 83&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following days, [[Alexandros Karapanos]], Zografos' nephew and a MP for [[Arta, Greece|Arta]],&lt;ref name="Miller519"&gt;Miller 1966: 519&lt;/ref&gt; was installed as foreign minister. Colonel [[Dimitrios Doulis]], a local from Nivice, resigned from his post in the Greek army and joined the provisional government as minister of military affairs. Within a few days, he managed to mobilize an army consisting of more than 5,000 volunteer troops.&lt;ref&gt;Boeckh 1996: 115&lt;/ref&gt; The local bishop, [[Vasileios of Dryinoupolis]], took office as minister of Religion and Justice. A number of officers of Epirote origin (not exceeding 30), as well as ordinary soldiers, deserted their positions in the Greek Army and joined the revolutionaries. Soon, armed groups, such as the "[[Epirote Sacred Band (1914)|Sacred Band]]" or Spyromilios' men around [[Himarë]] (gr. ''Himárra''), were formed&lt;ref name="Miller519" /&gt; in order to repel any incursion into the territory claimed by the autonomous government. The first districts to join the autonomist movement outside of [[Gjirokastër]] were Himarë, [[Sarandë]] and [[Përmet]].&lt;ref name="Brennpunkt Osteuropa"&gt;Heuberger, Suppan, Vyslonzil 1996: 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece’s reaction and evacuation===
The Greek government was reluctant to overtly support the uprising. Military and political officials continued to carry out a slow evacuation process, which had begun in March and ended on 28 April.&lt;ref name="Miller519" /&gt; Resistance was officially discouraged, and assurances were given that the Great Powers and the International Control Commission (an organization founded by the Great Powers in order to secure peace and stability in the area) would guarantee their rights. Following the declaration in Gjirokastër, Zografos sent messages to local representatives in [[Korçë]] (gr. ''Korytsá'') asking them to join the movement; however, the Greek military commander of the city, Colonel [[Alexandros Kontoulis]], followed his official orders strictly and declared martial law, threatening to shoot any citizen raising the Northern Epirote flag. When the local bishop of [[Kolonjë]] (gr. Kolónia), [[Archbishop Spyridon of Athens|Spyridon]], proclaimed the Autonomy, Kontoulis had him immediately arrested and expelled.&lt;ref name="Ruches 89-89"&gt;Kondis 1976: 127&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Epirote women Aug1914.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Armed group of Epirote women. August 1914, Gjirokastër region.]]

On March 1, Kontoulis ceded the region to the newly formed Albanian gendarmerie, consisting mainly of former deserters of the Ottoman army and under the command of Dutch and Austrian officers.&lt;ref name="Brennpunkt Osteuropa" /&gt; On March 9, the Greek navy blockaded the port of [[Sarandë]] (gr. ''Ágioi Saránda'', known also as ''Santi Quaranta''), one of the first cities that had joined the autonomist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Stickney 1924: 43&lt;/ref&gt; There were also sporadic conflicts between Greek army and Epirote units, with a few casualties on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Ruches 1965: 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiations and armed conflicts===
[[File:Βόρεια Ηπειρος-1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Award of Greece for the Northern Epirote struggle.]]
As the Greek army withdrew, armed conflicts broke out between Albanian and Northern Epirote forces. In the regions of Himarë, Sarandë, Gjirokastër and [[Delvinë]] (gr. ''Delvínion''), the revolt had been in full force since the first days of the declaration, and the autonomist forces were able to successfully engage the Albanian gendarmerie, as well as Albanian irregular units.&lt;ref name="Ruches 89-89" /&gt; However, Zografos, seeing that the Great Powers would not approve the annexation of Northern Epirus to Greece, suggested three possible diplomatic solutions:&lt;ref name="Brennpunkt Osteuropa" /&gt;
* full autonomy under the nominal sovereignty of the Albanian prince;
* an administrative and [[Canton (administrative division)|cantonal system]] autonomy; and
* direct control and administration by the European Powers.

On March 7, Prince [[William of Wied]] arrived in Albania, and intense fighting occurred north of Gjirokastër, in the region of [[Cepo]], in an attempt to take control over Northern Epirus; Albanian gendarmerie units tried unsuccessfully to infiltrate southwardly, facing resistance from the Epirotes.&lt;ref name="Miller519" /&gt; On March 11, a provisional settlement was brokered in [[Corfu]] by Dutch Colonel Thomson. Albania was prepared to accept a limited Northern Epirote government, but Karapanos insisted on complete autonomy, a condition rejected by the Albanian delegates, and negotiations reached a deadlock.&lt;ref name="Miller519" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruches 89-89" /&gt; Meanwhile, Epirote bands entered [[Erseka]] and continued on to [[Frashër]] and Korçë.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Sakellariou|first= M. V. |title=Epirus, 4000 years of Greek history and civilization|publisher=Ekdotike Athenon |year=1997 | pages = 480 |isbn=978-960-213-371-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UV1oAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=epirus+4000&amp;q=Erseka |location=p. 380 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, the entire region that had been claimed by the provisional government, with the exception of Korçë, was under its control. On March 22, a Sacred Band unit from [[Bilisht]] reached the outskirts of Korçë and joined the local guerillas, and fierce street fighting took place. For several days, Northern Epirote units controlled the city, but on March 27 this control was lost to the Albanian gendarmerie upon the arrival of Albanian reinforcements.&lt;ref name="Ruches 89-89" /&gt;

The International Control Commission, in order to avoid a major escalation of the armed conflicts with disastrous results, decided to intervene. On May 6, Zografos received a communication to initiate negotiations on a new basis. Zografos accepted the proposal and an armistice was ordered the next day. By the time the cease-fire order was received, the Epirote forces had secured the Morava heights near Korçë, making the city's Albanian garrison's surrender imminent.&lt;ref name="Ruches 91"&gt;Ruches 1965: 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of autonomy and outbreak of World War I==

===Protocol of Corfu===
{{Main|Protocol of Corfu}}
[[File:GZografos.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Georgios Christakis Zografos, through effective political maneuvers, gained Northern Epirus internationally recognized autonomous status.]]
Negotiations were carried out on the island of [[Corfu]], where on 17 May 1914 Albanian and Epirote representatives signed an agreement known as the Protocol of Corfu. According to its terms, the two provinces of [[Korçë]] and [[Gjirokastër]] that constituted Northern Epirus would acquire complete autonomous existence (as a ''[[corpus separatum (disambiguation)|corpus separatum]]'') under the nominal Albanian sovereignty of Prince Wied.&lt;ref name="Miller519" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruches 91" /&gt; The Albanian government had the right to appoint and dismiss governors and upper-rank officials, taking into account as much as possible the opinion of the local population. Other terms included the proportional recruitment of natives into the local gendarmerie and the prohibition of military levies from people not indigenous to the region.&lt;ref name="Miller519" /&gt; In Orthodox schools, the Greek language would be the sole medium of instruction, with the exception of the first three classes. The use of the Greek language was made equal to Albanian in all public affairs. The Ottoman-era privileges of Himarë were renewed, and a foreigner was to be appointed as its "captain" for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1966: 520&lt;/ref&gt;

The execution of and adherence to the Protocol was entrusted to the International Control Commission, as was the organization of public administration and the departments of justice and finance in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Stickney 1924: 49&lt;/ref&gt; The creation and training of the local gendarmerie was to be conducted by Dutch officers.&lt;ref&gt;Boeckh 1996: 116&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|'''Territory:''' All the provisions in question shall apply to the populations of the territories previously occupied by Greece and annexed to Albania.&lt;br /&gt;'''Armed Forces:''' Except in case of war or revolution, non-native military units shall not be transferred to or employed in these provinces.&lt;br /&gt;'''Occupation:''' The International Control Commission (I.C.C.) will take possession in the territory in question, in the name of the Albanian Government, by proceeding to the place. The officers of the Dutch mission will at once begin the organization of the local gendarmerie...Before the arrival of the Dutch officers, the necessary steps will be taken by the Provisional Government of Argyrokastro for the removal of the country of all armed foreign elements. These provisions will not only be applied in that part of the provinces of Korytsa now occupied militarily by Albania, but in any other southern regions.&lt;br /&gt;'''Liberty of language:''' The permission to use both Albanian and Greek shall be assured, before all authorities, including the Courts, as well as the elective councils.&lt;br /&gt;'''Guarantee:''' The Powers who, by the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Conference of London]], have guaranteed the institution of Albania and established the I.C.C. guarantee the execution and maintenance of the foregoing provisions. | From the Protocol of Corfu, May 17, 1914&lt;ref&gt;Ruches 1965: 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The agreement of the Protocol was ratified by the representatives of the Great Powers at Athens on 18 June and by the Albanian government on 23 June.&lt;ref&gt;Stickney 1924: 50&lt;/ref&gt; The Epirote representatives, in an [[Assembly of Delvino|assembly in Delvinë]], gave the final approval to the terms of the Protocol, although the delegates from Himara protested, claiming that union with Greece was the only viable solution.&lt;ref&gt;Kondis: 132–133&lt;/ref&gt; On July 8, control of the cities of [[Tepelenë]] and [[Korçë]] passed to the provisional government of Northern Epirus.&lt;ref name="Miller519" /&gt;

===Instability and disestablishment===
After the outbreak of [[World War I]], the situation in Albania became unstable, and political chaos emerged as the country was split into a number of regional governments. As a consequence of the anarchy in central and northern Albania, sporadic armed conflicts continued to occur in spite of the Protocol of Corfu's ratification,&lt;ref&gt;Ruches 1965: 94&lt;/ref&gt; and on September 3 Prince Wilhelm departed the country. In the following days, an Epirote unit launched an attack on the Albanian garrison in [[Berat]] without approval from the provisional government, managing to capture its citadel for several days, while Albanian troops loyal to [[Essad Pasha Toptani|Essad Pasha]] initiated small-scale armed operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Leon |first=George B. | title=Greece and the Albanian Question at the Outbreak of the First World War| format=| url=https://books.google.com/?id=yFppAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=berat%2Bepirotes%2B1914&amp;q=Berat#search_anchor |work=Institute for Balkan Studies |pages=61–80 [74] | year=1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These events worried Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, as well as the possibility that the unstable situation could spill over outside Albania, triggering a wider conflict. On 27 October, after receiving the approval of the Great Powers,&lt;ref&gt;Guy 2007: Greek troops crossed the southern Albanian border at the end of October 1914, officially reoccupying all of southern Albania, exclusive of Vlorë, and establishing a military administration by 27 October 1914, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; the Greek Army's [[V Army Corps (Greece)|V Army Corps]] entered the area for a second time. The provisional government formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives.

==Aftermath==

===Greek administration (October 1914 – September 1916)===
During the Greek administration at the time of the First World War, it had been agreed to by Greece, Italy and the Great Powers that the final settlement of the Northern Epirote issue would be left for the post-war future. In August 1915, Eleftherios Venizelos stated in the Greek parliament that "only colossal faults" could separate the region from Greece. Upon Venizelos' resignation in December, however, the succeeding royalist governments were determined to exploit the situation and predetermine the region's future by formally incorporating it into the Greek state. In the first months of 1916, Northern Epirus participated in the [[Greek legislative election, December 1915|Greek elections]] and elected 16 representatives to the Greek Parliament. In March, the region's union with Greece was officially declared, and the area was divided into the [[prefectures of Greece|prefectures]] of Argyrokastro and Korytsa.&lt;ref&gt;Stickney 1924: 57- 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian–French occupation and Interwar period===
[[File:Stamp Epirus 1914 5l flag.jpg|thumb|right|Postage stamp issued by the Northern Epirote postal authorities with the state's flag.]]
The politically unstable situation that followed in Greece during the next months, with the [[National Schism]] between royalists and Venizelos’ supporters, divided Greece into two states. This situation, according also to the development of the [[Balkan Front]], led [[Italian Army|Italian]] forces in [[Gjirokastër]] to enter the area in September 1916, after gaining the approval of the Triple Entente, and to [[Italian protectorate over Albania|take over most of Northern Epirus]]. An exception was [[Korçë]] which was retaken by [[French Army|French]] forces from Bulgarian occupation, and turned into the Autonomous Albanian [[Republic of Korçë]] under the military protection of the French army. After the war's end in 1918, the tendency to reestablish the autonomy of the region continued.&lt;ref&gt;Winnifrith 2002: 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919 (the Venizelos-Tittoni agreement), Northern Epirus was to be awarded to Greece, but political developments such as the Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]] and strong Italian opposition in favor of Albania caused the area to be finally ceded to Albania in 1921.&lt;ref name=Miller543/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitromilides 2008: 162–163&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1922, the Albanian Parliament approved the Declaration of Minority Rights. However, the Declaration, contrary to the Protocol of Corfu, recognized minority rights only in a limited area (parts of [[Gjirokastër]], [[Sarandë]] district and 3 villages in [[Himarë]]), without implementing any form of local autonomy. All Greek schools in the excluded area were forced to close until 1935, in violation of obligations accepted by the Albanian government at the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Basil Kondis &amp; Eleftheria Manda.

Institute of Balkan Studies. 1994, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, [[Protocol of Florence|Albania's present borders]] were set, leading Greece to abandon its claims to Northern Epirus.&lt;ref&gt;Brad K.

==The Northern Epirote issue and the autonomy question==
{{See also|Northern Epirus #The Northern Epirote issue at present|l1=The Northern Epirote issue at present}}

From the Albanian perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian sources of that time, the Northern Epirote movement was directly supported by the Greek state, with the help of a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania.&lt;ref&gt;Ruches 1965: 87&lt;/ref&gt; In Albanian historiography, the Protocol of Corfu is either scarcely mentioned&lt;ref&gt;Nataša Gregorič [http://repozitorij.ung.si/IzpisGradiva.php?id=1777&amp;lang=eng ''Contested Spaces and Negotiated Identities in Dhermi/Drimades of Himare/Himara area, Southern Albania, University of Nova Gorica 2008, p. 144.]&lt;/ref&gt; or seen as an attempt to divide the Albanian state and proof of the Great Powers' disregard for Albania's national integrity.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Vickers and James Pettifer.

Publishers, 1997, {{ISBN|1-85065-290-2}}, p 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the ratification of the Protocol of Corfu, the term "Northern Epirus", the state’s common name—and consequently that of its citizens, "Northern Epirotes"—acquired official status. However, after the region's cession to Albania, these terms were considered associated with Greek [[irredentism|irredentist]] action and not granted legal status by the Albanian authorities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Russell King |editor2=Nicola Mai |editor3=Stephanie Schwandner-Sievers |first= |title=The New Albanian Migration |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |year=2005 | pages = 66| ref=Migration |isbn=978-1-903900-78-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=05Mw4-b9oN0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; anyone making use of them was persecuted as an enemy of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Two friendly peoples: excerpts from the political diary and other documents on Albanian-Greek relations, 1941–1984 | publisher = Enver Hoxha, Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin Institute | year = 1985 | location = | pages = |ref= | isbn = | url= https://books.google.com/?id=MJW4AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autonomy question remains on the diplomatic agenda in [[Albanian-Greek relations]] as part of the Northern Epirote issue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Heuberger, Suppan, Vyslonzil 1996: 73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, Albania's borders were fixed by the Protocol of Florence, and the [[Kingdom of Greece]] abandoned all claims to Northern Epirus.&lt;ref&gt;''It was not until 1925 that Albania's present borders were fixed through the Florence Protocol, the Kingdom of Greece finally abandoning its claims to northern Epirus''. ... in, Brad K.

[[Image:baldknobbersrr.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Depiction of Bald Knobbers in the 1919 film ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills]]'']]
The '''Bald Knobbers''' were a group of [[vigilante]]s in the [[Ozarks|Ozark]] region of southwest [[Missouri]] from 1883 to 1889. They are commonly depicted wearing black horned hoods with white outlines of faces painted on them, a distinction that evolved during the rapid proliferation of the group into neighboring counties from its [[Taney County, Missouri|Taney County]] origins. The group got its name from the grassy [[Appalachian balds|bald knob summits]] of the nearby Ozark Mountains. The hill where they first met, Snapp's Bald, is located just north of [[Kirbyville, Missouri]]. An article in the October 5, 1898 issue of [[Springfield, Missouri]]'s ''The Leader-Democrat'' states:

{{quote|Henry Westmoreland is in from [[Beaver County, Oklahoma]], which was formerly a part of the strip known as No-Man's-Land. He says grass is in abundance and cattle plenty, but no efforts are made at raising crops there, except roughness and alfalfa. The venerable gentleman owned a ranch in Taney County at the time of the Bald Knob uprising, and was the man who gave that organization its name.}}

The Bald Knobbers, who for the most part had sided with the North in the [[American Civil War]], were opposed by the Anti-Bald Knobbers, who for the most part had sided with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]]. Hernando summarizes their political role:

{{quote|They began as a group dedicated to protecting life and property, aiding law enforcement officials in the apprehension of criminals, opposing corruption in local government, and punishing those who violated the social and religious mores of their community. In some places, the vigilantes gained much political influence, occupied key offices, and became effectively the ruling faction in local politics. They made many enemies, however, with whom they had several violent, sometimes fatal, confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew J. Hernando, ''The Bald Knobbers of Southwest Missouri, 1885-1889: A Study of Vigilante Justice in the Ozarks'' (PhD dissertation Louisiana Tech University, 2011), p viii&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Background==
During the Civil War, Missouri as a border state was hard hit by neighbor against neighbor [[bushwhacker]] fighting. After the war the neighbor versus neighbor fighting continued throughout the state with perhaps the most famous being the actions of the [[James-Younger Gang]]. Authorities had a difficult time bringing the criminal fighting under control because both sides still held strong partisan supporters. Between 1865 and 1885, Taney County reported there were 40 murders and not a single suspect was ever convicted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendsofamerica.com/MO-Baldknobber.html Missouri Legends – The Fierce Missouri Bald Knobbers – Legendsofamerica.com – Retrieved November 7, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bald Knobbers initially set out to put an end to the marauding gangs.  But the Bald Knobbers were to end up having their own excesses and criminal activities.

==The Taney County chapter==
In 1883, thirteen men led by Nat N. Kinney formed the group, in retaliation against the hordes of invading marauders that had plagued the area since the start of the [[Reconstruction Era]].  The original thirteen were Nat Kinney, James A. DeLong, Alonzo S. Prather, Yell Everett, James B. Rice, T.W. Phillips, James R VanZandt, Pat F. Fickle, Galba E. Branson, J.&amp;nbsp;J. Brown, Charles H. Groom, James K. Polk McHaffie, and possibly Ben Price. During the period of 1865-1882, over thirty murders were committed, none leading to a conviction. The group was called both the "Citizen's Committee" and "The Law and Order League" by its members.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Hartman, and Elmo Ingenthron, ''Bald Knobbers: Vigilantes on the Ozarks Frontier'', p 30&lt;/ref&gt; However, because their secret meetings were held atop a "bald" mountaintop (in order to keep a lookout for spies), the public began to refer to them as the Bald Knobbers. As their numbers grew into the hundreds, out of a county of only 7,000 people, the original intent began to lose focus. Though initially praised for driving out the notorious outlaws (such as the [[Taylor brothers]]), public sentiment soon turned against them.

Although the men initially wore nothing more than a simple [[kerchief]] over their lower faces, if any disguise at all, many soon adopted a simple white [[muslin]] hood with corners tied off like ears, and cut out eye and mouth holes. This fearsome appearance only inflamed the anti-sentiment, peaking with the formation of the anti-Bald Knobbers. While the Bald Knobbers were mostly [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s that had fought for the [[Union Army]], most of the anti-Bald Knobbers were [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]s who had supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. When the county courthouse burned down, both rival sides pointed fingers at each other, intensifying the bitterness between the groups.

This loosely knit anti-Bald Knobber faction was best represented by the 19-year-old orphan Andy Coggburn. Coggburn hated Kinney, a very persuasive individual with a mysterious past, who had moved into the area with his family two years before the Bald Knobbers came into being. Coggburn took great pleasure in deriding Kinney, pulling pranks and speaking out against the vigilante gang. Kinney and his fellow Bald Knobbers held considerable pull in the county, and in no time Coggburn was shot and killed by Kinney in "[[self defense]]" outside the local church of [[Forsyth, Missouri|Forsyth]], where Kinney had gone to preach that night.

In 1886, after gaining national notoriety from their exploits, and embarrassing state leaders, Missouri Governor John S. Marmaduke sent Adjutant General J.C. Jamison to Forsyth to investigate the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Darnell, Gerry. [https://thelibrary.org/lochist/periodicals/bittersweet/su79e.htm "Bald Knobbers: The Ozark Vigilantes"], ''[[Bittersweet (journal)|Bittersweet]]'', Vol. 6 Num. 4 Summer 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival, although the representative was pleased to see the atmosphere of order that prevailed, he recommended to Kinney that an official dissolution of the Bald Knobbers would be in the best interest of the county. That next day a formal dissolution ceremony was held in the town square where the Bald Knobbers were publicly disbanded, having served their original purpose.

==The Christian County chapter==
Neighboring counties such as [[Christian County, Missouri|Christian]], [[Douglas County, Missouri|Douglas]], [[Greene County, Missouri|Greene]], and [[Stone County, Missouri|Stone]] had already adopted the idea of masked night riders, and disregarded the strict rules that had governed the original Taney county chapter. The Christian County group became the most notorious by far. At the time [[Chadwick, Missouri|Chadwick]]  was the most bustling town of Christian County due to the nearby railroad, and a prime market for timber made into railroad ties. However, Chadwick's design as a "railroad town" meant that saloons and brothels dominated the area, and led many men to gamble, drink, and whore away their week's earnings.

In a move towards moral straightening, the Christian County chapter was led by Dave Walker.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Walker&amp;GSfn=David&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSst=26&amp;GScnty=1418&amp;GScntry=4&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=23284590&amp;df=all&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; However, his seventeen-year-old son Billy Walker was a wild force within their group. Though it is rumored the Walkers had invited Nat Kinney from neighboring Taney County to help institute the Christian County chapter, it is doubtful this occurred since Kinney had recently disbanded the original group himself. There were also several differences between the groups. The Christian County group held meetings at a large cave on the edge of the Walker's land, and the members wore black hoods with cork or wooden horns protruding out of the top, decoratively designed with white or red stripes around the eyes, mouth, and horns, and sometimes with tassels dangling off the horn points. The members also routinely burned down saloons, and were generally more threatening than the Taney County group had been.

William Edens was a young opponent of the group, and would publicly criticize them. After he received several warnings (including a late-night beating), tragedy struck. The night of March 11, 1887, the Christian County group met at the cave to discuss disbanding. However, that night new members were inducted, and several members were incensed by new remarks William Edens had made about the band. As the meeting finished, many of the younger men headed home the long way, towards the Edens' cabin. Captain David Walker pleaded with them not to go, but his son Billy and several others, including Wiley Mathews, were headstrong.

When the men discovered that Edens was not home, they continued up the road to the cabin of James and Elizabeth Edens, William's parents. William Edens and his sick wife, Emma, were staying the night. So were James and Elizabeth's daughter Melvina who was sick with the measles, Melvina's husband, Charles Green and the Green children ages three years and three months. The Bald-Knobbers busted in the windows and splintered in the doors of the tiny cabin, spraying shotgun blasts as they intruded. In the gunshot exchange, William Edens and Charles Green were killed, James Edens seriously wounded from an axe blow to the head and Bald Knobbers William Walker and John Mathews shot. The wails of the women and children led neighbors to the scene of the massacre. First to arrive was Charles Green's father, George Green, who lived near enough to hear the shots.

Though Dave Walker had attempted to prevent the men in his group from letting their actions escalate, his very presence in the nearby road at the time of the attack ultimately doomed him. After 80 men were indicted and tried in a series of worldwide-media covered trials {{Citation needed| reason ="Worldwide" media coverage is indicated rather than national coverage.|date=March 2018}} over the course of the next 18 months, it was ultimately decided that four would hang for the crimes: Dave Walker, his young son Billy, Deacon John Mathews and his nephew Wiley Mathews. Wiley would later escape the county's new jail, leaving the three others to be punished for the reign of the vigilantes.

As the Christian County men awaited their fate in jail, old rivalries ran rampant. A group of Anti-Bald Knobbers, still unsatisfied with the outsider Kinney's intrusion into their community, met together and selected an assassin for their cause. In August 1888, farmer Billy Miles entered a store where Kinney was inventorying for the courts, and killed the ex-Bald Knobber leader with three shots from his pistol. He then stepped outside and surrendered to the law, claiming self-defense. The event made worldwide news, and Billy Miles was given full [[exoneration]] in very little time.

Back in Christian County, the execution date came to bear on May 10, 1889. After a late night of prayer services and repentance, the next morning the three men were led out into an enclosed area and onto a scaffolding the sheriff built himself, despite not having any prior hanging experience in executing prisoners. After last-minute prayers and final goodbyes between a father and son, the trap was sprung. Onlookers watched the three men twist and writhe on ropes that were too long. The condemned men's feet dragged along the ground, and at one point young Billy's rope broke, leaving him writhing on the ground and calling out for help. He was re-hanged, and after thirty-four minutes, the last of them finally died. Public criticism of the botched executions ran rampant.

Taney County's loose Bald Knobber threads were being tied together at long last as well, as the law officially sought vengeance for Nat Kinney's untimely assassination. Sheriff Galba Branson enlisted the aide of an out-of-state [[bounty hunter]] named Ed Funk. Together they sought Billy Miles on the Fourth of July, 1889. After visiting several [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations, they finally found him at a spring with a group of men on the edge of the [[Kirbyville, Missouri|Kirbyville]] Picnic. They approached him with warning shots, and a gunfight broke out between the ex-Bald Knobber supporters, the Anti-Bald Knobber supporters, and the lawmen. Both Funk and Branson were killed, and Billy Miles and his brothers fled the area.

==Cultural impact==
Though the Kirbyville Shootout is seen as the general end to the story of the Bald Knobbers, there was at least one more quiet incident in 1890 involving an adulterer being lynched by a band of masked men, and here and there lie undocumented stories about unofficial retributions involving masked hoodlums in neighboring counties all the way up into the 1920s.{{clarify|date=February 2017}} Bald knobber stories made headlines across the country at the time, and again as the original Bald Knobbers passed away.

As early as 1887 the Bald Knobber story was already being translated into popular culture as a play titled ''The Bald Knob Tragedy of Taney and Christian Counties''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew J. Hernando, ''The Bald Knobbers of Southwest Missouri, 1885-1889: A Study of Vigilante Justice in the Ozarks'' (PhD dissertation Louisiana Tech University, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The start of Branson-area and Taney County tourism began with the 1907 publication of [[Harold Bell Wright]]'s ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills]]'', which features generic Bald Knobbers as the story's villains.  Later, the Mabe family began a local country and western [[comedy revue]] called ''Baldknobbers'' (one word, and named solely for the humorous quality of the name rather than for any historical purpose); the Mabe family attraction started the music-show presence for which Branson has become famous.

More recent Bald Knobber-related fare includes the indoor roller-coaster ride, [[Fire In The Hole (Silver Dollar City)|Fire in the Hole]], at the [[Silver Dollar City]] theme park; it is a ride through a Bald Knobber theme, but not specifically grounded in any historical events. Starting in 2000, the [[White River Valley Historical Society]] in Forsyth began producing a "Law Day" festival, featuring a Bald Knobber pageant focusing on the Taney County Bald Knobber history. And finally, a documentary produced about the vigilantes, featuring several reenactments, original locations, and descendants of either side, entitled ''Fire in the Mountain'', premiered at several film festivals beginning in the spring of 2007 (winning the Gold Remi Award at Worldfest in Houston, TX), and had its television premiere on Jan. 13th, 2011, on the OPT Missouri PBS station as part of their Ozarks Reflections series.  A feature film version is also in the works. There are few books and merchandise relating to Bald Knobber history, but documentary producer/director [[Damon Blalack]] has heavily researched and collected many items relating to the group in his creation of ''Fire in the Mountain'', and plans to help establish a stronger museum representation of the history in conjunction with the White River Valley Historical Society.

A '''black bloc''' is a name given to groups of protesters who wear black clothing, scarves, sunglasses, ski masks, motorcycle helmets with padding, or other face-concealing and face-protecting items.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;[http://www.ainfos.ca/01/jun/ainfos00170.html Autonomia and the Origin of the Black Bloc].

It is also used to protect their faces and eyes from [[pepper spray]], which is used by law enforcement during protests or civil unrest.

On 1 May 1987, demonstrators in [[Berlin-Kreuzberg]] were confronted by [[West Germany|West German]] [[Landespolizei|police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kreuzberger-chronik.de/chroniken/2004/mai/geschichte.html | work =Kreuzberger Chronik | title = Der Mythos von Bolle – Sie lesen das Original! aus Berlin-Kreuzberg | place = [[Germany|DE]] |language=German |accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, thousands of people attacked the police with rocks, bottles and Molotov cocktails. The riots at the [[May Day in Kreuzberg]] became famous after the police had to completely pull out of the "SO 36" neighborhood in Kreuzberg for several hours, and rioters looted shops together with residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/berlin/article198052/Die_Nacht_als_Bolle_in_Kreuzberg_abbrannte.html |title=Die Nacht, als Bolle in Kreuzberg abbrannte | place = Berlin | work = Berliner Morgenpost |date=30 April 2007 |language=German |accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Ronald Reagan]] came to Berlin in June 1987, he was met by around 50,000 demonstrators protesting against his [[Cold War]] policies. This included a black bloc of 3,000 people. In November 1987, the residents were joined by thousands of other protesters and fortified their squat, built barricades in the streets and defended themselves against the police for nearly 24 hours. After this the city authorities legalised the squatters residence.

On 1 May 1988, radical left groups organised a [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] demonstration through Berlin-Kreuzberg, ending in riots even heavier than the year before. The police were attacked with steel balls fired by slingshots, stones, fireworks and Molotov cocktails. On 2 May, headline of the Berlin newspaper [[B.Z. (newspaper)|BZ]] was "Beirut?? Nein, das ist Berlin!" (Beirut?? No, it's Berlin!). The riots finally became a tradition in Berlin-Kreuzberg and have recurred every 1 May since, but never as fatally as in the first two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first1 =Peter | last1 = Neumann | first2 = Jan | last2 = Thomsen |url=http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2007/0216/berlin/0032/ |title= Kreuzberger übernehmen Vorbereitung für den 1.

Numbering around 80,000, the protesters greatly outnumbered the police. Officials tried to maintain control by banning all demonstrations and attacking public assemblies. Nevertheless, there were riots and [[upmarket]] shopping areas were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=AG |last=Grauwacke |contribution=We Will Disrupt this Conference: Resistance to the 1988 IMF and World Bank Conference in West Berlin |publisher=Dissent Network! |title=Days of Dissent: Reflections on Summit Mobilisations |url=http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk./berlin.htm |place=UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK25pjXS?url=http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk./berlin.htm |archivedate=18 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = German | first = AG | last = Grauwacke | title = Autonome in Bewegung: aus der ersten 23 Jahren | publisher = Association A | ISBN = 3-935936-13-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
[[File:MobG20Hamburg.jpg|thumb|Part of a black bloc in Hamburg during the G20 summit]]

In the period after the [[Berlin Wall]], the German black bloc movement continued traditional riots such as May Day in [[Berlin-Kreuzberg]], but with decreasing intensity. Their main focus became the struggle against the recurring popularity of [[Neo-Nazism]] in Germany. The "turn" came in June 2007, during the [[33rd G8 summit]]. A black bloc of 2,000 people built barricades, set cars alight and attacked the police during a mass demonstration in [[Rostock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,486280,00.html |title=G-8-Protest: Randale in Rostock – 430 verletzte Polizisten |work=Der Spiegel |date=2 June 2007 |language=German |accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 400 police officers were injured, and also about 500 demonstrators and activists. According to the German [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution|Verfassungsschutz]], the weeks of organisation before the demonstration and the riots themselves were amounted to a revival for the militant left in Germany.

On the day of President [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]], black bloc groups were present among other protests in Washington, D.C. and other places.

The first recorded use of the tactic in United States of America occurred at the Pentagon, in Washington, D.C. on 17 October 1988. Over one thousand demonstrators—a small number consisting of a black bloc—called for the end to U.S. support for the right wing death squads in El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;See The Black Bloc Papers, page 35, Breaking Glass Press, Shawnee Mission, KS, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A black bloc caused damage to property of [[Gap (clothing retailer)|GAP]], [[Starbucks]], [[Old Navy]], and other retail locations in downtown Seattle during the 1999 [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|anti-WTO demonstrations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rick Anderson |url=http://archive.seattleweekly.com/1999-12-22/news/delta-s-down-with-it/ |title=Delta's down with it – Page 1  |work=Seattle Weekly |date=22 December 1999 |accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were a common feature of subsequent [[anti-globalization]] protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In the years after the end of the Vietnam War, protest in the US came to assume more legalistic, orderly forms, and was increasingly dominated by the middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;Doug McAdam, et al. [http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/sampson/files/2005_mobilization.pdf “There Will Be Fighting in the Streets: The Distorting Lens of Social Movement Theory”], ''Mobilization: An International Journal'' 10(1): 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponded with the rise of a highly effective police strategy of [[crowd control]] called "negotiated management."&lt;ref&gt;McPhail, Clark, David Schweingruber and John McCarthy. 1998. [http://www.public.iastate.edu/~dschwein/policing.pdf “Policing Protest in the United States: 1960-1995"], pp. 49-69, in della Porta, Donatella and Herbert Reiter (eds), ''Policing Protest: The Control of Mass Demonstrations in Western Democracies''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many social scientists have noted the "institutionalization of movements" in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Doug McAdam, et al. "There Will Be Fighting in the Streets: The Distorting Lens of Social Movement Theory", ''Mobilization: An International Journal'' 10(1): 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; These currents largely constrained disruptive protest until 1999. In an unprecedented success for post-Vietnam era civil disobedience, the WTO Ministerial Conference opening ceremonies were shut down completely, host city Seattle declared a state of emergency for nearly a week, multilateral trade negotiations between the wealthy and developing nations collapsed, and all of this was done without fatalities. This occurred in the midst of mass rioting which had been set off by militant anarchists, some of them in a black bloc formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/wtohist/day2.htm "Day 2- November 30, 1999"], WTO History Project, University of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/544135.stm “Seattle Declares Civil Emergency”], BBC News, December 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Vidal, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/05/wto.globalisation "The real battle of Seattle"], ''The Guardian'', December 5, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead up to the shutdown, local group Seattle Anarchist Response (SAR) had circulated Ward Churchill's text ''[[Pacifism as Pathology]]'' freely among protesters. SAR actively promoted among the rank-and-file of the [[Direct Action Network]] (DAN) and criticized [[NGO]] hegemony of the protests. They often found an enthusiastic response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bikesexual.org/cm/wto/prepare.htm Seattle Anarchist Response Bulletin], November 15, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The call for the Seattle protest had originally come from [[Peoples Global Action]] (a network co-founded by the [[EZLN|Zapatistas]]) which supported [[diversity of tactics]] and a highly flexible definition of nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;Geov Parrish, [http://www.seattleweekly.com/1999-11-17/news/beyond-gandhi "Beyond Gandhi"], ''The Seattle Weekly'', November 17, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the shutdown, however, various NGO spokespeople associated with Seattle DAN claimed that the riotous aspect of the WTO protests was counterproductive and undemocratic. They also asserted that it was only an insignificantly small group from Eugene, Oregon that engaged in property destruction. [[Medea Benjamin]] told ''The New York Times'' that "These anarchists should have been arrested," &lt;ref&gt;Alexander Cockburn and our readers, [http://www.thenation.com/article/wto-workers-world-united# “WTO: Workers of the World United?”] ''The Nation'', February 14, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Egan, [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/02/world/talks-and-turmoil-the-violence-black-masks-lead-to-pointed-fingers-in-seattle.html “Black masks lead to pointed fingers in Seattle”], ''The New York Times'', December 2, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; while Lori Wallach of Public Citizen stated that she had instructed Teamsters to assault black bloc participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/documents/Lori's%20War.pdf "Lori’s War"], ''Foreign Policy'', Spring 2000, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, numerous scholar-activists including [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] decried the NGO leaders as "hypocrites," and wrote that nonviolent activists ought to be "treating the young rock-throwers like sisters and brothers in the struggle." The author-activist also criticized the dominant nonviolent paradigm as "absurdly ritualized,." &lt;ref&gt;Barbara Ehrenreich, [http://www.alternet.org/story/9309/flip_side%3A_anarkids_and_hypocrites "Anarkids and Hyprocrites"], ''The Progressive'', June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The solution to Ehrenreich's impasse was the growing acceptance of black bloc tactics in the anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQSaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;ots=Qr9EuYx1rc&amp;sig=mteDqHdDBsq1PR2e2LGIFVtkcQc&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE7eW1_7fYAhWJPN8KHUX8AFgQ6AEIajAO&amp;q=ehrenreich.%20black%20bloc|title=Understanding Occupy from Wall Street to Portland: Applied Studies in Communication Theory|last=Heath|first=Renee Guarriello|last2=Fletcher|first2=Courtney Vail|last3=Munoz|first3=Ricardo|date=2013-08-29|publisher=Lexington Books|year=|isbn=9780739183229|location=|pages=108–109|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/free/pga/hallm.htm “Hallmarks of People’s Global Action (amended at the 3rd PGA conference at Cochamamba, 2001)”.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cindy Milstein, [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/27d/055.html "Something Did Start in Quebec City: North America’s Revolutionary Anti-Capitalist Movement"], Institute for Social Ecology, June 13, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
During the [[2013 protests in Brazil|June–July 2013 mass public demonstrations]], groups of people using Black Bloc tactics started attending demonstrations, especially those held across the street from governor of Rio de Janeiro State [[Sérgio Cabral]]'s residence and the state government palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/rio/black-blocs-a-baderna-premeditada-na-zona-sul-9094666|title=Black Blocs e a baderna premeditada na Zona Sul|publisher=[[Globo.com]]|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/rio/pm-culpa-black-blocs-por-confusao-em-laranjeiras-9135174|title=PM culpa Black Blocs por confusão em Laranjeiras|publisher=[[Globo.com]]|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police face accusations of infiltrating the movement and, at times, acting as agents provocateurs by starting confrontations. Many leftists claim that video footage shows an infiltrated police officer throwing a molotov cocktail that wounded a riot policeman, although this has been denied by the police and hasn't been proven until today (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/video-of-clashes-in-brazil-appears-to-show-police-infiltrators-among-the-protesters|title=Video of Clashes in Brazil Appears to Show Police Infiltration of Protesters|work=The New York Times|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protester violence occurred regularly during the Brazilian protests (particularly the week of 17 to 21 June) even when not linked with the black bloc, or with police infiltration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://igarape.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Black-Bloc-Rising-Social-Networks-in-Brazil.pdf "Black Bloc Rising: Social Networks in Brazil"].

''The Guardian'', 21 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the denunciations by media, police, and even some activists, the black bloc tactic persisted in the movement. By October 2013, "The mask-wearers were welcomed by the protesters who wanted to wreak havoc during manifestations...Indeed, this sense of solidarity amidst the demonstrations, this shared manning of barricades, inspires a common determination to fight against the fear of repression." According to a report by two Brazilian leftists published in Al Jazeera, this coincided with a revival in the breadth of the street protests that had not been seen since its early days in June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/10/black-bloc-teachers-education-crisis-explodes-onto-rios-streets-2013102211262755153.html Bruno Cava and Marcelo Castaneda "Black Bloc and Teachers: Education crisis explodes on Rio's streets"].  Al Jazeera, 23 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October, the Rio teacher's union (Sepe) officially declared support for the recent black bloc actions, stating that the bloc were "welcome" at their demonstrations. Postings on teacher Facebook groups praised bloc participants as "fearless."&lt;ref&gt;[http://odia.ig.com.br/noticia/educacao/2013-10-09/sindicato-dos-professores-declara-oficialmente-apoio-aos-black-blocs.html "Sindicato do professores declara oficialmente apoio aos black blocs"].

====Europe====

During May 1, 2018, over 1,200 black bloc took part of strikes in Paris, France. High damages on public infrastructures and stores were committed.

A group of about 400 black bloc demonstrators took part in the [[2011 London anti-cuts protest]] where they attacked various high end retail outlets; according to journalist [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]] this may have been the largest ever black bloc assembly in the UK. Mason says some of the participants were anarchists from Europe, others were British students radicalised after participation in the [[2010 UK student protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mason|first=Paul|chapter = Ch. 3|title=Why It's Kicking Off Everywhere: The New Global Revolutions|location=London,Verso|year=2012|isbn=978-1-84467-851-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A black bloc protested the opening of the [[universal exposition]] [[Expo 2015]] in Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Bacchi |first1=Umberto |last2=Iaccino |first2=Ludovica |last3=Mezzofiore |first3=Gianluca |title=Milan Expo 2015: Violent May Day protests at No Expo anti-capitalist demonstration |work=International Business Times UK |date=2015-05-01 |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/milan-expo-2015-violent-may-day-protests-no-expo-anti-capitalist-demonstration-1499334 |accessdate=2017-06-28 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police infiltration===
On occasion, police and security services have infiltrated black blocs, apparently for purposes of investigation, provocation. Allegations first surfaced after several demonstrations. At the 2001 [[27th G8 summit|G8 summit in Genoa]], among the many complaints about the police&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Advisory: Media Missing New Evidence About Genoa Violence|url=http://www.fair.org/activism/genoa-update.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314122126/http://www.fair.org/activism/genoa-update.html|archivedate=14 March 2012|publisher=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR]]|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was mention of video footage which "suggests that men in black were seen getting out of police vans near protest marches."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Carroll|first=Rory|title=Men in black behind chaos: Hardliners plan 'actions' away from main protesters|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/23/globalisation.davidpallister|accessdate=28 June 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 July 2001|author2=John Vidal|author3=David Pallister|author4=Owen Bowcott}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, [[Quebec police]] admitted that "their officers disguised themselves as demonstrators" in Montebello. However, the officers purportedly did not engage in violence, and claimed that they were carrying rocks because other protesters were doing so. They were identified by genuine protesters because of their police-issue footwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Quebec police admit they went undercover at Montebello protest |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/quebec-police-admit-they-went-undercover-at-montebello-protest-1.656171|accessdate=29 January 2014|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Topping|first=David|title=Bon Cop, Bad Cop|url=http://torontoist.com/2007/08/bon_cop_bad_cop.php| publisher=Torontoist.com|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to veteran activist [[Harsha Walia]], it was other participants in the black bloc who identified and exposed the undercover police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/rabbletv/program-guide/2010/03/features/diversity-tactics-diversity-opinions |title=Rabble TV "A Diversity of Tactics – A Diversity of Opinions" '&amp;#39;Rabble.ca'&amp;#39;, March 5, 2010 |publisher=Rabble.ca |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence that the black bloc tactic is particularly vulnerable to infiltration, however, as investigatory – and even agent provocateur – activity has taken place regularly among completely nonviolent, non-"black bloc" campaigns. In 2003, the [[Oakland Police Department|Oakland, California Police Department]] infiltrated a group of demonstrators protesting police brutality and the war in Iraq at the port; subpoenaed private comments by Captain [[Howard Jordan (police officer)|Howard Jordan]] indicate that his plan was to steer the march away from the police station in order to avoid confrontation. In internal documents, Jordan mentioned this strategy was common in other police departments, including San Francisco and Seattle."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclunc.org/sites/default/files/asset_upload_file714_3255.pdf “State of Surveillance: Government Monitoring of Political Activity in Northern &amp; Central California A Report by the ACLU of Northern California”  Written by Mark Schlosberg, Police Practices Policy Director, July 2006]; {{cite news|last=Gonzalez |first=Richard| title=Oakland Police Spy on Anti-War Group|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5626076|accessdate=13 April 2012|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tactics==

{{Quote
 |quote  = When we smash a window, we aim to destroy the thin veneer of legitimacy that surrounds private property rights … After N30 [30 November], many people will never see a shop window or a hammer the same way again. The potential uses of an entire cityscape have increased a thousand-fold. The number of broken windows pales in comparison to the number of spells—spells cast by a corporate hegemony to lull us into forgetfulness of all the violence committed in the name of private property rights and of all the potential of a society without them. Broken windows can be boarded and eventually replaced, but the shattering of assumptions will hopefully persist for some time to come.

Tactics of a black bloc primarily include [[vandalism]] of private property, [[rioting]], and demonstrating without a permit. Tactics can also include use of defensive measures such as misleading the authorities, assisting in the escape of people arrested by the police ("un-arrests" or "de-arrests"), administering [[first aid]] to persons affected by [[tear gas]], [[rubber bullets]] and other [[riot control]] measures in areas where protesters are barred from entering, building [[barricade]]s, resisting the police, and practicing [[jail solidarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressaction.com/news/weblog/full_article/zakkflash02072012/ |title=Hedging Our Bets on the Black Bloc: The Impotence of Mere Liberalism |publisher=Press Action |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514175233/http://www.pressaction.com/news/weblog/full_article/zakkflash02072012/ |archivedate=14 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southerncrossreview.org/13/genoa.htm|title=Battle of Genoa|publisher=Southern Cross Review|accessdate=16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juris|first=Jeffrey S.|title=Violence Performed and Imagined: Militant Action, the Black Bloc and the Mass Media in Genoa|journal=Critique of Anthropology|year=2005|volume=25|issue=4|pages=413–432|doi=10.1177/0308275X05058657|url=http://coa.sagepub.com/content/25/4/413|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property destruction carried out by black blocs tends to have symbolic significance: common targets include banks, institutional buildings, outlets for [[multinational corporation]]s, gasoline stations, and video-surveillance cameras.&lt;ref name="pressaction.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressaction.com/news/weblog/full_article/zakkflash02152012/ |title=A Principled Stand on Diversity of Tactic: Avoiding Uniformity of Failure |publisher=Press Action |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513100050/http://www.pressaction.com/news/weblog/full_article/zakkflash02152012/ |archivedate=13 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be several blocs within a particular protest, with different aims and tactics.&lt;ref name="K, 2001"&gt;K, 2001, "being black block" in ''On Fire: the battle of Genoa and the anti-capitalist movement'', p. 31, One Off Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[adhocracy|ad hoc]] group, blocs often share no universally common set of principles or beliefs&lt;ref name="K, 2001" /&gt; apart from an adherence to—usually—[[Far-left politics|radical left]] or [[autonomist]] values, although some anarchist groups have called for the [[Saint Paul Principles]] to be adapted as a framework in which diverse tactics can be deployed.&lt;ref name="pressaction.com"/&gt; A few radical right-wing groups, like some of the "[[autonomous nationalists]]" of Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Nicola|first=Stefan|title=Germany's new neo-Nazis |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2008/05/20/Germanys-new-neo-Nazis/UPI-87471211285700/ |accessdate=28 June 2010|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Australian so-called "[[National-anarchism|National-Anarchists]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sunshine|first=Spencer|title=Rebranding Fascism: Nationalists|journal=Public Eye Magazine|date=April 2008|volume=23 |url=http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v23n4/rebranding_fascism.html |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have adopted "black bloc" tactics and dress.

In 2000, some months after the [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|Battle of Seattle]] and the A16 protests against the IMF in Washington DC, the [[Green Mountain Anarchist Collective]] (based out of rural Vermont), called for Black Bloc activities to be coordinated on the tactical level, through the temporary election of street officers democratically empowered to make fast tactical decisions, especially concerning movement, while in confrontation with state police forces. This collective also called for Black Bloc actions to entail reserve groups, who could be called into a clash by these elected officers. These proposals were mapped out in the first edition of the pamphlet ''Communique on Tactics''. The pamphlet was controversial within the anarchist community. Some anarchists attacked this approach be being too formal and bordering on Leninist in structure. The Green Mountain Anarchist Collective countered that the direct election of tactical officers was historically in line with the CNT and FAI anarchist militias during the Spanish Civil War. Of those early segments of the anarchist scene that agreed, in principle, with these assertions were the [[Barricada Collective]] (Boston, MA) and [[Columbus Anti-Racist Action]] (Ohio). The Barricada Collective, in their publication of the same name, published the pamphlet, and also wrote their own essays calling for a more nuanced and more militant use of the Black Bloc in the North American anarchist movement.

In July 2001 the Green Mountain Anarchist Collective would go on to produce a second edition of the ''Communique on Tactics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anti-racist-action-the-green-mountain-anarchist-collective-black-bloc-tactics-communique|title=Communique on Tactics|publisher=The Anarchist Library|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; pamphlet in cooperation with Columbus ARA. This second edition further refined the proposal to suggest, among other things, that large Black Blocs, composed of numerous affinity groups, could reach a further level of tactical sophistication by each affinity group further specializing their capabilities (i.e. offense, defense, recon, etc.) and by investing coordinating ability to the elected officer core. This pamphlet, like the first, was debated among anarchists. Aspects of these tactical reforms were field tested with some success at the Festival De La Pueblo 5 May March in Boston in 2002, and the siege of the Lewiston Armory (in opposition to a failed neo-Nazi organizing meeting), Maine, 2003. Both these actions were organized largely by the Northeast Federation of Anarcho-Communist (whom the Green Mountain Anarchist Collective and Barricada were then affiliated).

'''Béchir Sfar''' ({{lang|ar|البشير صفر}}), (27 February 1856, [[Tunis]] - 1 March 1917, Tunis), was a Tunisian nationalist campaigner and politician.

== Youth and early career==
Sfar’s father was originally from [[Mahdia]], where he served as [[caïd]].  He was also a high-ranking officer in the army of the [[List of Beys of Tunis|Bey of Tunis]], and later worked in the Tunisian War Ministry. Béchir Sfar himself was born in Tunis. He was in the first graduating class of the [[Collège Sadiki]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Julien |first=Charles-André|date=1967 |title=Colons français et Jeunes-Tunisiens (1882-1912) |trans-title=French colonists and Young Tunisians (1882-1912) |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_0300-9513_1967_num_54_194_1445 |language=fr |journal=Revue Française d’Histoire d’Outre-Mer|volume=LIV |issue=194-197 |pages=108 |doi= |access-date=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then went to [[Paris]] to continue his studies at the [[lycée Saint-Louis]]. In 1881, when France established a protectorate over Tunis, he interrupted his studies and returned home, and took up a government post in June of that year. In 1882 he became head of the accounting division in the office of the [[Grand vizier]], a post he held until 1891. During these years he became involved in a number of cultural institutions, and founded the [[Khaldounia]] association.&lt;ref name="KarpSchubring2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alexander Karp|author2=Gert Schubring|title=Handbook on the History of Mathematics Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MYy9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA418|date=25 January 2014|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-9155-2|pages=417-418}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For a number of years he headed the [[Waqf|Habous]] Council which was responsible for land donated by benefactors and held in trust for public benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexalgeria.free.fr/Le%20habous.htm |title=Le Habous, Le Domaine Public et Le Trust |last=Khalfoune |first=Tahar |date= |website=Lexalgeria |publisher=Lexalgeria |access-date=28 April 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold H. Green, The Tunisian Ulama 1873-1915: Social Structure and Response to Ideological Currents, Brill Archive, 1978 p.111&lt;/ref&gt; However a series of colonial laws began allowing the French to acquire growing amounts of habous land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elloumi |first1=Mohamed |date=2013 |title=Les terres domaniales en Tunisie.

In 1898 Sfar resigned from his position on the Habous Council in protest at these enforced sales to French colonists.&lt;ref name="Perkins2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth Perkins|title=A History of Modern Tunisia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N05kAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|date=20 January 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02407-6|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reform activities ==
Sfar’s career in politics as an active nationalist reformer began on 2 August 1888 when he founded the newspaper ''El Hadhira'' (The Capital),&lt;ref name="BerkesLittle1976"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Niyazi Berkes|author2=Donald Presgrave Little|title=Essays on Islamic Civilization: Presented to Niyazi Berkes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8UUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA74|year=1976|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=90-04-04464-7|pages=74–}}&lt;/ref&gt; managed by another member of the Khaldounia association, [[Ali Bouchoucha]]. In his articles, he called on his fellow Tunisians, some of whom were fascinated by [[France]], to “prevent themselves from falling into a condition of excess, where they would deny their Muslim Arab culture and lose their identity.” He believed that Tunisian national renewal could only be achieved through education, exposing young people to Islamic culture alongside the sciences, economics, history, geography and modern languages.&lt;ref name="FageRoberts1986"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. D. Fage|author2=A. D. Roberts|author3=Roland Anthony Oliver|title=The Cambridge History of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zywkdNMeltkC&amp;pg=PA278|date=24 July 1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-22505-2|pages=278–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Sfar co-founded the [[Young Tunisians|Young Tunisian movement]] with [[Ali Bach Hamba]] and his brother Mohamed.&lt;ref name="FageRoberts1986"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. D. Fage|author2=A. D. Roberts|author3=Roland Anthony Oliver|title=The Cambridge History of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zywkdNMeltkC&amp;pg=PA278|date=24 July 1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-22505-2|pages=278–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mugoti2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Godfrey Mugoti|title=Africa (a-z).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Plvuddy_4NYC&amp;pg=PA522|year=2009|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-4357-2890-5|pages=522–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1907 he visited Egypt, where his experiences left a strong impression on him. Like Tunisia, Egypt was a protectorate at the time (of Britain), but the differences with Tunisia were marked: the effects of modern education were everywhere to be seen in public life, while industry, agriculture and infrastructure were in the hands of Egyptians, as were most official posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alterinfo.net/Voyage-de-Bechir-Sfar-en-Egypte-en-1908-un-pretexte-pour-exacerber-les-rivalites-coloniales-franco-anglaises-en-Afrique_a42847.html |title=Voyage de Béchir Sfar en Egypte en 1908, un prétexte pour exacerber les rivalités coloniales franco-anglaises en Afrique du Nord |last=Karoui |first=Hatem |date=19 February 2010 |website=www.alterinfo.net |publisher=alteringo.net |access-date=28 April 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908 in the [[Ottoman Empire]] left Sfar and his colleagues in this group increasingly isolated from the more traditional religious authorities in Tunisia who had previously welcomed his reform ideas; the orientation of the Young Tunisians was towards the [[Young Turks]], while the [[ulama]] supported [[Abdul Hamid II]].&lt;ref name="Green1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arnold H. Green|title=The Tunisian Ulama 1873-1915: Social Structure and Response to Ideological Currents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rLY3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|year=1978|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=90-04-05687-4|pages=208–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Confrontation with the colonists ==
In his speech before the Resident General in 1906, Sfar declared: 

"The Muslim population appreciates, to the proper extent, the useful improvements and reforms accomplished by the Protectorate government.  It is aware, too, of the measures the government is taking to advance charitable works and public assistance. But it’s recognition if these things would be all the stronger if, in relieving poverty, our government would seriously study the means of preventing it. Professional, commercial and agricultural education, made widely available to the native population; effective training and protection for Tunisian labour; revival of local industries by customs controls and other measures; and finally the preservation of native land rights; these, Mr. Resident General, in our humble opinion, are the many proper measures which will reduce or end the economic crisis which is bearing down on Muslim society today.”&lt;ref&gt;Taoufik Ayadi, ''Mouvement réformiste et mouvements populaires à Tunis (1906-1912)'', Ed. Publications de l’Université de Tunis, Tunis, 1986, {{p.|41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Julien |first=Charles-André|date=1967 |title=Colons français et Jeunes-Tunisiens (1882-1912) |trans-title=French colonists and Young Tunisians (1882-1912) |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_0300-9513_1967_num_54_194_1445 |language=fr |journal=Revue Française d’Histoire d’Outre-Mer|volume=LIV |issue=194-197 |pages=123 |doi= |access-date=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
In [[France]], the '''''cabinet noir''''' ([[French language|French]] for "[[black room]]") was the office where the letters of suspected persons were opened and read by public officials before being forwarded to their destination. However, this had to be done with some sophistication, as it was considered undesirable that the subjects of the practice know about it, and "that the black chamber not interrupt the smooth running of the postal service."&lt;ref name=everything2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Black%20Chamber |title=Black Chamber |publisher=Everything2 |date=2001-01-14 |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice had been in vogue since the establishment of posts, and was frequently used by the ministers of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]; but it was not until the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] that a separate office for this purpose was created. This was called the ''cabinet du secret des postes'', or more popularly the ''cabinet noir''. Although declaimed against at the time of the [[French Revolution]], it was used both by the revolutionary leaders and by [[Napoleon]].

== Outside France ==
By the 1700s, cryptanalysis was becoming industrialized, with teams of government cryptanalysts working together to crack the most complex monoalphabetic ciphers. Each European power had its own so called black chamber, a nerve centre for deciphering messages and gathering intelligence. The most celebrated, disciplined and efficient was the Geheime Kabinettskanzlei in Vienna. It operated according to a strict timetable, because it was vital that its activities should not interrupt the smooth running of the postal service. Letters which were supposed to be delivered to embassies in Vienna were first routed via the black chamber, arriving at 7 am. Secretaries melted seals, and a team of stenographers worked in parallel to make copies of the letters. Within three hours the letters had been resealed and returned to the central post office to be delivered to their intended destination. As well as supplying the emperors of Austria with vital intelligence, the Viennese black chamber sold the information it harvested to other European powers. In 1774, for example, an arrangement was made with Abbot Georgel, the secretary in the French embassy, who had access to a biweekly package on information for 1,000 [[ducat]]s.

Black chambers were also employed by the [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Leeuw|first=Karl|date=1999|title=The Black Chamber in the Dutch Republic during the War of the Spanish Succession and Its Aftermath, 1707-1715|jstor=3020898|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=42|issue=1|pages=133–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' took the view that the ''cabinet noir'' had disappeared{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}, but that the right to open letters in cases of emergency still appeared to be retained by the French government; and a similar right was occasionally exercised in [[England]] under the direction of a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]]. In England, this power was frequently employed during the eighteenth century{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and was confirmed by the [[Post Office Act 1837]]; its most notorious use was, perhaps, the opening of [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzini]]'s letters in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cabinet Noir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such [[postal censorship]] became common during [[World War I]]. Governments claimed that the [[total war]] which was waged required such censorship to preserve the civilian population's [[morale]] from heart-breaking news up from the front. Whatever the justification, this meant that not a single letter sent from a soldier to his family escaped previous reading by a government official, destroying any notion of [[privacy]] or of [[secrecy of correspondence]]. Post censorship was retained during the [[interwar period]] and afterwards, but without being done on such a massive scale.

A '''camarilla''' is a group of [[courtier]]s or favourites who surround a [[king]] or ruler. Usually, they do not hold any office or have any official authority at the [[Court (royal)|royal court]] but influence their ruler behind the scenes. Consequently, they also escape having to bear responsibility for the effects of their advice.  The term derives from the Spanish word ''camarilla'' (diminutive of ''cámara''), meaning "little chamber" or private cabinet of the king. It was first used of the circle of cronies around Spanish King [[Ferdinand VII]] (reigned 1814-1833). The term involves what is known as [[cronyism]]. The term also entered other languages like the [[German language|German]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and is used in the sense given above.

A similar concept in modern politics is that of a [[Kitchen Cabinet]], which is often composed of unelected advisers bypassing traditional governance practices.

==Examples==
===Germany===
In particular, two groups are called camarillas: those who surrounded the Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]]{{cn|date=February 2014}} and the President [[Paul von Hindenburg]].&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n55/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe |location=New York| publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John |authorlink=John Gunther| year=1940 | pages=33-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In the 19th century, Russia's government was frequently described as a "camarilla", starting as early as 1860.&lt;ref&gt;"Prince Dolgoroukov on Russia and Self-Emancipation." ''Edinburgh Review'', July, 1860. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jq7PAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA90 p. 90]&lt;/ref&gt; This usage remained common into the 20th century; for instance, in 1917, commentator Robert Machray wrote of
:... certain forces in the background of the political life of Russia known as the 'Camarilla', which exercised and still exercise an extraordinary influence...&lt;ref&gt;Machray, Robert. "The Political Situation in Russia." ''The Nineteenth Century and After'', volume 81, March 1917. [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1dDAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA601 pp. 601-602]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{campaignbox French Wars of Religion}}
'''Camisards''' were [[Huguenot]]s (French [[Protestantism|Protestant]]s) of the rugged and isolated [[Cévennes]] region, and the [[Vaunage]] in [[southern France]]. They raised an insurrection against the persecutions which followed the [[Edict of Fontainebleau|Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, which had made Protestantism illegal. The Camisards operated throughout the mainly Protestant Cévennes region which in the eighteenth century also included the [[Vaunage]] and the parts of the [[Camargue]] around [[Aigues Mortes]]. The revolt by the Camisards broke out in 1702, with the worst of the fighting continuing until 1704, then scattered fighting until 1710 and a final peace by 1715. The [[Edict of Versailles|Edict of Tolerance]] was not finally signed until 1787.

==Etymology==
The name ''camisard'' in the [[Occitan language]] may derive from a type of linen smock or shirt known as a ''camisa'' (chemise) that peasants wear in lieu of any sort of uniform. Alternatively, it might come from the Occitan word ''camus'', meaning paths (chemins). ''Camisada'', in the sense of "night attack", is derived from a feature of their tactics.{{sfn|Bersier|2016}}

==History==
[[File:Protestant France.svg|thumb|16th-century religious geopolitics on a map of modern France.
{{legend|Purple|Controlled by Huguenot nobility}}
{{legend|#D8BFD8|Contested between Huguenot and Roman Catholic nobility}}
{{legend|Blue|Lutheran-majority territory}}]]
In April 1598, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] had signed the [[Edict of Nantes]] and the religious wars that had ravaged France ended. Protestants had been given limited civic rights and the liberty to worship according to their convictions. This "fundamental and irrevocable law" was maintained by Henry's son, [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. In October 1685, Henry's grandson, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV (The Sun king)]], revoked the Edict of Nantes, issuing his own [[Edict of Fontainebleau]]. Louis was determined to impose a single religion on France: that of Rome. As early as 1681 he instituted the [[dragonnade]]s which were conversions enforced by [[dragoon]]s, labelled "missionaries in boots". They were [[billet]]ed in the homes of Protestants to help them decide to convert back to the official church or alternatively to emigrate. The Cévennes was a centre of resistance, and the policy did not work.{{sfn|Schlegel|2008}}

The Edict of Fontainebleau removed all rights and protections from the Huguenots. There followed about twenty years of persecutions. Reformed worship and private Bible readings were outlawed. Within weeks of the new edict over 2000 Protestant churches were burned, under the direction of [[Nicolas de Lamoignon|Nicholas Lamoignon de Basville]], the royal administrator of Languedoc, and entire villages were massacred and burnt to the ground in a series of stunning atrocities. The pastors and worshippers were captured and later exiled, sent to the galleys, tortured or killed. Seventy-five missionary priests under the command of [[François Langlade|Abbot François Langlade]] were sent to the Cévennes. 
Soldiers carrying crosses on their muskets forced the peasants to sign papers to say they were converting, and forced them to attend mass. The peasants continued to attend illicit meeting. Huguenots with a trade, fled to neighbouring countries. The King responded by closing the borders.{{sfn|Schlegel|2008}}

The Protestant peasants of the Vaunage and the Cévennes, led by a number of teachers known as "prophets", notably François Vivent and [[:fr:Claude Brousson|Claude Brousson]], resisted. Vivent encouraged his followers to arm themselves in case they were set upon by Royalist soldiers. Several leading prophets were tortured and executed, François Vivent in 1692 and Claude Brousson in 1698. Many more were exiled, leaving the abandoned congregations to the leadership of less educated and more mystically-oriented preachers, such as the [[combing|wool-comber]] [[:fr:Abraham Mazel#Le début de la guerre des Camisards|Abraham Mazel]]. The Catholic church was likened to the [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast of the Apocalypse]] and the clandestine prophets claimed to have seen it in the prophetic dreams. Mazel, in a dream, saw black oxen in his garden and heard a voice telling him  to chase them away. From 1700 the clandestine prophets and their armed followers were hidden in houses and caves in the mountains. {{sfn|Schlegel|2008}}

===Abraham Mazel===
Open hostilities began on 24 July 1702, with the assassination at [[le Pont-de-Montvert]] of a local embodiment of royal oppression, [[François Langlade]], the Abbé of Chaila. Langlade had recently arrested and tortured a group of seven Protestants accused of attempting to flee France.&lt;ref name=".net"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rolland|first1=Pierre|title=La Guerre des Camisards|url=http://www.camisards.net/guerrecami-fr.htm|website=Camisards.net|publisher=Association d'étude et de recherche sur les camisards|accessdate=30 August 2016|ref=harv|location=48160 St-Martin-de-Boubaux|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110141730/http://www.camisards.net/guerrecami-fr.htm#|archive-date=2016-11-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band of Camisards were led by Abraham Mazel, who peacefully asked for the release of the prisoners, but when this was refused, they commenced the killing.&lt;ref name=Ruff&gt;Pierre-Jean Ruff, 2008. Le Temple du Rouve: lieu de mémoire des Camisards. Editions Lacour-Ollé, Nîmes.[http://templedurouve-english.asso-web.com Website Le Temple du Rouve, the first Camisards and freedom of conscience]&lt;/ref&gt; The abbé was quickly lionized in print by the Catholic State as a martyr of his faith.

The Camisards worked independently of each other and during the day most merged back into their village communities. They were predominantly agricultural workers or artisans and had no aristocratic leaders. They knew the paths and the sheep tracks intimately. They called themselves the Children of God - they were inspired by religion, not by patronage or politics.

===Jean Cavalier===
Led by the young [[Jean Cavalier]] and [[Roland Laporte|Pierre Laporte (Rolland)]], the Camisards met the ravages of the royal army with [[irregular warfare]] methods and withstood superior forces in several pitched battles.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Eliza Bray (1870), ''The Revolt of the Protestants of the Cevennes, with some account of the Huguenots in the seventeenth century''. John Murray, London.[https://books.google.com/books?id=VR5MDn0i69AC&amp;oe=UTF-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence increased as atrocities were committed on both sides: massacres in Catholic villages such as [[Fraissinet-de-Fourques]], [[Saint-André-d'Olérargues|Valsauve]] and [[Potelières]] by camisards. Basville, a government administrator with a reputation founded on torture, deported the entire populations of [[Mialet, Gard|Mialet]] and [[Saumane, Gard|Saumane]]. Then in the autumn of 1703, with the king's consent, the systematic "Burning of the Cévennes" destroyed 466 hamlets and exiled their populations.{{sfn|Bersier|2016}}

Other Protestants, like those of [[Fraissinet-de-Lozère]], under the influence of village elites, chose a loyalist attitude and fought the Camisards. They were nevertheless equally victims, losing their homes, during the "Burning of the Cévennes".&lt;ref&gt;Ghislain Baury, ''La dynastie Rouvière de Fraissinet-de-Lozère. Les élites villageoises dans les Cévennes protestantes d'après un fonds d'archives inédit (1403-1908)'', t. 1: ''La chronique'', t. 2: ''L'inventaire'', Sète, Les Nouvelles Presses du Languedoc, 2011, http://sites.google.com/site/dynastierouviere/&lt;/ref&gt;

White Camisards, also known as "Cadets of the Cross" ("Cadets de la Croix", from a small white cross which they wore on their coats), were Catholics from neighbouring communities such as [[Saint-Florent-sur-Auzonnet|St. Florent]], [[Senechas]] and [[Rousson, Gard|Rousson]] who, on seeing their old enemies on the run, organized into companies to loot and to hunt the rebels down.{{sfn|Bersier|2016}} They committed atrocities, such as killing 52 people at the village of [[Brenoux]], including pregnant women and children.

Other opponents of the Protestants included six hundred [[Miquelet (militia)|miquelet]] marksmen from [[Roussillon]] hired as [[mercenary|mercenaries]] by the King.

In 1704, [[Claude Louis Hector de Villars]], the royal commander, offered vague concessions to the Protestants and the promise to Cavalier of a command in the royal army. Cavalier's acceptance of the offer broke the revolt, although others, including Laporte, refused to submit unless the [[Edict of Nantes]] was restored. Scattered fighting went on until 1710, but the true end of the uprising was the arrival in the Cévennes of the Protestant minister [[Antoine Court (Huguenot)|Antoine Court]] and the reestablishment of a small Protestant community that was largely left in peace, especially after the death of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1715.

==The people==
42% of the Camisards were Cévennes peasants, and 58% were rural craftsmen, of whom 75% worked as wool-combers, wool-carders and weavers. All spoke Occitan. There were no noblemen involved, none had been trained in the art of war. There was no concept of a single army, there was no single leader but every region had its permanent organisers and occasional soldiers.{{sfn|Bersier|2016}}

Religiously, ordained pastors were rounded up, and a series of prophets ministered secretly.{{explain|date=August 2017}} Notable among them{{according to whom|date=August 2017}} were:
*Esprit Séguier
*Abraham Mazel
*Elie Marion
*Jean Cavalier
The visions of the prophets inspired the operations of the war, and encouraged the peasants to feel invincible. The peasants marched singing [[Psalm 68|Psalms]] — which unnerved the opposition.{{sfn|Bersier|2016}}

== Heritage ==
Jean Cavalier later went over to the British, who made him Governor of the island of [[Jersey]].

A [[millenarianism|millenarian]] group of ex-Camisards under the guidance of Elie Marion emigrated to [[London]] in 1706, and were said to have links with the [[Alumbrados]]. They were generally treated with scorn and some official repression as the "French Prophets". Their example and their writings had some influence later, both on the spiritual outlook of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and on [[Ann Lee]], founder of the [[Shakers|Shaker]] movement.

[[File:Pillory-french-prophets1.jpg|thumb|250px|Title and illustration of an anonymous handbill printed in London in 1707.  The picture shows Élie Marion, Jean Daudé, and [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]], leaders of the so-called French prophets, standing on the scaffold at Charing Cross after being sentenced to the pillory for sedition.]]

=== Role in the survival of Protestantism in France ===
After the main active Camisard groups had been subdued in various ways, the French authorities were keen not to re-ignite the revolt and took a more moderate approach to anti-Protestant repression. Many former Camisards came back to a more peaceful approach and from 1715 onwards helped re-establish a still illegal but now much better organised Protestantism. They were under the leadership of [[Antoine Court]] and of the numerous travelling pastors who were permitted to re-enter the country.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Joutard, Les Camisards, Gallimard 1976, rédité en coll. Folio Histoire en 1994, pp.217-219&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "The Camisards' legend" ===
In his book with the title ''La légende des Camisards'', Philippe Joutard, a Professor of History, registered the very lively oral tradition about the Camisards which has prevailed to this day in the Cévennes region. He also observed the "attractive power" of this striking period of history where many unrelated episodes have been integrated through the oral tradition. As this oral transmission is mainly done through the families, it often highlights more of their own ancestors who were faithful to their convictions than the heroic leaders of the revolt. In so doing it develops beyond the original religious question to a general attitude of resistance and non-conformity which determines a whole philosophical, political and human culture and way of life.&lt;ref name=Joutard&gt;Philippe Joutard, La légende des Camisards, NRF Gallimard, 1977, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe Joutard also noted that even the minority of [[Catholics]] living in this Protestant part of the country tend to reconstruct their history in the same way as their former religious opponents.&lt;ref name=Joutard/&gt; The footprint of the Camisards in Cévennes is thus particularly deep and lasting.

The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the [[Middle Ages]], and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries. The last cardinal-nephew was named in 1689 and the practice was extinguished in 1692.&lt;ref name="bunson"&gt;Bunson, Matthew. 1995.

''The Catholic Church Through The Ages: A History''. Paulist Press. {{ISBN|0-8091-4234-1}}. p. 170. Vidmar gives the exception of [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], who elevated his half-brother Filippo Calandrini on December 20, 1448 (see: Salvator, 1998, "[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/consistories-xv.htm 15th Century (1404–1503)]").&lt;/ref&gt; although one of [[Alexander VI]]'s creations was his own son.

The institution of the cardinal-nephew evolved over seven centuries, tracking developments in the [[history of the papacy]] and the styles of individual Popes.  From 1566 until 1692, a cardinal-nephew held the [[Roman Curia|curial office]] of the '''Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State''', known as the '''Cardinal Nephew''', and thus the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. The curial office of the Cardinal Nephew as well as the institution of the cardinal-nephew declined as the power of the [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] increased and the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] of popes decreased in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The [[list of cardinal-nephews]] includes at least fifteen, and possibly as many as nineteen popes&lt;ref&gt;S. Miranda: [http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1127.htm#Suburra Consistory of 1127], citing some older authors such as [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]], says that [[Pope Anastasius IV]] (Corrado della Suburra) was probably a nephew of his elevator [[Honorius II]]; however, modern scholars (Brixius, p. 36 and 78; Klewitz, p. 128; Hüls, p. 128 and 201; Zenker, pp. 46–48) are in agreement that Corrado was created cardinal by Paschalis II, and deny or do not mention his relationship with Honorius II.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Gregory IX]], [[Pope Alexander IV|Alexander IV]], [[Adrian V]], [[Gregory XI]], [[Boniface IX]], [[Innocent VII]], [[Eugene IV]], [[Pope Paul II|Paul II]], [[Alexander VI]], [[Pius III]], [[Julius II]], [[Leo X]], [[Clement VII]], [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], and [[Pius VII]]; perhaps also [[John XIX]] and [[Benedict IX]], if they were really promoted cardinals; as well as [[Innocent III]] and [[Benedict XII]], if in fact they were related to their elevators); one antipope ([[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]]); and two or three saints ([[Charles Borromeo]], [[Guarinus of Palestrina]], and perhaps [[Anselm of Lucca]], if he was really a cardinal).

== History ==

=== Before 1566 ===
[[File:Façade du Palais des Papes.jpg|thumb|The [[Avignon Papacy]] (1309–1377) produced an [[List of cardinal-nephews#14th century|unprecedented number of cardinal-nephews]].]]

The creation of cardinal-nephews predates the hierarchical preeminence of cardinals within the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which grew out of the 1059 decree of [[Pope Nicholas II]], ''[[In nomine Domini]]'', which established [[cardinal bishop]]s as the sole electors of the Pope, with the consent of [[cardinal deacon]]s and [[cardinal priest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, Salvator. 1998. "[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/essay.htm Essay of a General List of Cardinals (112-2006)]".&lt;/ref&gt; The first known cardinal-nephew is Lottario ({{lang-la|Loctarius}}), seniore, cousin of [[Pope Benedict VIII]] (1012–1024), elected circa 1015.&lt;ref name="mxi" /&gt; Benedict VIII also elevated his brother [[Pope John XIX|Giovanni]] (the future Pope John XIX) and his cousin [[Pope Benedict IX|Teofilatto]] (the future Pope Benedict IX) as cardinal-deacons.&lt;ref name="mxi"&gt;Miranda, Salvator. 1998. "[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/consistories-xi.htm General list of Cardinals: 11th Century (999–1099)]".&lt;/ref&gt; The first known cardinal-nephew after 1059 is [[Anselm of Lucca]], the nephew or brother of [[Pope Alexander II]] (1061–1073),&lt;ref name="mxi" /&gt; although until the end of 12th the majority of the alleged cases of such appointments are dubious, either because the relationship between the Pope and cardinal is not proven, or because the cardinalate of the papal kinsman is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;For the discussion concerning dubious cases see [[List of cardinal-nephews]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is beyond doubt that the promotions of papal relatives to the College of Cardinals were [[List of cardinal-nephews#13th century|common in 13th century]].

According to historian John Bargrave, "by the [[Council of Florence|Council of Bazill]], Session 21, the number of cardinals was not to be above 24, and not any nephew of the Pope or of any cardinal was to be of that number. (''Session'' 23.)"&lt;ref&gt;[[John Bargrave|Bargrave, John]], edited by [[James Craigie Robertson]], 1867. ''Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals''. Camden Society. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Titian - Ranuccio Farnese - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Ranuccio Farnese (cardinal)|Ranuccio Farnese]] was made cardinal by Paul III at the age of 15.]]
[[Pope Clement VI]] (1342–1352) created more cardinal-nephews than any other pontiff, including six on September 20, 1342, the greatest number of cardinal-nephews elevated at one time. The [[conclave capitulation|capitulation]] of the [[Papal conclave, 1464|1464 papal conclave]] limited the Pope it elected ([[Pope Paul II]]) to appointing one cardinal-nephew, along with other conditions designed to increase the power of the [[College of Cardinals]] and reduce the Pope's ability to dilute that power.&lt;ref&gt;Burke-Young, Francis A. 1998. "[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/election-paulii.htm The election of Pope Paul II (1464)]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] declared in 1514 that the care of relatives was to be commended, and the creation of cardinal-nephews was often recommended or justified based on the need to care for indigent family members.&lt;ref name="nepotism" /&gt; A cardinal-nephew could usually expect profitable appointments; for example, [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Alessandro Farnese]], cardinal-nephew of [[Pope Paul III]] (1534–1549) held 64 [[benefice]]s simultaneously in addition to the vice-chancellorship.&lt;ref&gt;Ekelund et al., 2004, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Paul IV]] (1555–1559), in his old age, was said to have "fallen almost completely under the cardinal-nephew's influence";&lt;ref&gt;Setton, 1984, p. 639.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul IV's cardinal-nephew, [[Carlo Carafa]], was accused in August 1558 by a [[Theatines|Theatine]] of seducing a Roman noble woman, Plautila de' Massimi, who had come into possession of an inordinate amount of money and jewelry, but the accusations were dismissed by the pontiff.&lt;ref&gt;Setton, 1984, p. 711.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint [[Charles Borromeo]], cardinal-nephew of [[Pope Pius IV]] (1559–1565), had ensured the subordination of the ''[[secretarius intimus]]'' to the Cardinal Nephew, which came to be sometimes known as the ''secretarius maior''.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1981, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Pius IV was notorious for nepotism: between 1561 and 1565 he transferred more than 350,000 ''[[scudi]]'' to his relatives.&lt;ref name="ekelund"&gt;Ekelund et al., 2004, p. 702.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Council of Trent]] (1563), [[Pope Pius V]] (1566–1572) drew up the terms for the office of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State, who was to handle the temporal affairs of the [[Papal States]] and the foreign relations of the [[Holy See]]. After abortively attempting to divide the duties of the Superintendent between four non-familial cardinals, Pius V acceded to the urgings of the College of Cardinals and his Spanish ambassador, and appointed his grandnephew, [[Michele Bonelli]], as Superintendent, demarcating his duties with a [[papal bull]] of March 14, 1566.&lt;ref name="portemer" /&gt; However, Pius V relentlessly avoided delegating any real autonomous power to Bonelli.&lt;ref&gt;Signorotto and Visceglia, 2002, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cardinal Nephew (also called ''cardinale padrone''&lt;ref name="portemer"&gt;[[Madeleine Laurain-Portemer|Laurain-Portemer, Madeleine]], Levillain, ed., 2002. "Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State", p. 1467–1469.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Secretarius Papae et superintendens status ecclesiasticæ'':&lt;ref name="curia" /&gt; "Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State",&lt;ref name="portemer" /&gt; {{lang-it|Sopraintendente dello Stato Ecclesiastico}}&lt;ref name="nepotism"&gt;Reinhard, Wolfgang, Levillain, ed., 2002. "Nepotism", p. 1031–1033.&lt;/ref&gt;) was an official [[Papal legate|legate]] of the [[Roman Curia]], approximately equivalent to the [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], which absorbed its functions after the office of Cardinal Nephew was abolished in 1692.&lt;ref name="curia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avignon" /&gt; The office has been likened by historians to a "[[prime minister]]", "''[[alter ego]]''",&lt;ref name="portemer" /&gt; or "vice-pope".&lt;ref name="h102"&gt;Hsia, 2005, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinal Nephew was generally among a Pope's first cardinal creations, and his ''creature'' was traditionally accompanied by a [[salute]] from the guns of [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].&lt;ref name="vintro"&gt;Pirie, Valérie. 1965. "[http://www.pickle-publishing.com/papers/triple-crown-preliminary-chapter.htm The Triple Crown: An Account of the Papal Conclaves: Preliminary Chapter]". Spring Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Avignon Papacy]], the Cardinal Nephew was responsible for the spiritual and temporal governance of the [[Comtat Venaissin]], where the Avignon Popes had resided; in 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] raised the [[Diocese of Avignon]] to the rank of an archbishopric, to the benefit of his nephew [[Giuliano della Rovere]].&lt;ref name="avignon"&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Avignon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Donna olimpia maidalchini.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pope Innocent X]] named the son, nephew, and cousin of his sister-in-law [[Olimpia Maidalchini]] to the curial office of the Cardinal Nephew]]
The terms of the office of Cardinal Nephew were established by a [[papal brief]] developed and refined by Pius V's successors to [[Pope Paul V|Paul V]] (1605–1621).&lt;ref name="portemer" /&gt; The Cardinal Nephew was also the correspondence liaison for all [[papal nuncio]]s and [[Papal legate|gubernatorial legates]], and the prefect for two congregations: the [[Consulta]] and the [[Congregazione del Buon Governo]].&lt;ref name="nepotism" /&gt; The Cardinal Nephew was also the captain-general of the papal army and a "channel through which flowed benefices one way and gold the other".&lt;ref name="vintro" /&gt;

However, these formal functions only came into force during the pontificates of unusually weak Popes; most Cardinal Nephews were the ''de facto'' [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] of the pontiff himself.&lt;ref name="nepotism" /&gt;

Although [[Pope Leo XI]] (1605) died before he was able to elevate his nephew, [[Roberto Ubaldini]], Ubaldini was elevated by Leo XI's successor, [[Pope Paul V]] in 1615.&lt;ref name="s144"&gt;Signorotto and Visceglia, 2002, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians consider [[Scipione Borghese]], cardinal-nephew to [[Pope Paul V]], to be the "prototypical representative" of a cardinal-nephew, unlike those before him, created to "provide for and oversee the permanent social and economic ascent of the reigning papal family into the ranks of the high Roman aristocracy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Bireley|Bireley, Robert]]. 2004. Book Review of ''Bürokratie und Nepotismus unter Paul V. (1605–1621): Studien zur frühneuzeitlichen Mikropolitik in Rom'' by Birgit Emich. ''The Catholic Historical Review''. '''90''', 1: 127–129.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1616, 24 of the 30 abbeys belonging to Borghese were rented out, a practice the [[Council of Trent]] had attempted to eliminate.&lt;ref name="ekelund" /&gt; A thorough financial analysis of Borghese's cardinalate by Reinhard Volcker (based on a series of extant account books) examines the strategies Borghese used to build up wealth during his uncle's pontificate and non-ecclesiastical assets before his uncle's death, which Volcker considers to be exemplary of [[Baroque]] papal families.&lt;ref&gt;Osheim, Duane J.

'''90''', 4: 971–972.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that Paul V Borghese had transferred to his family approximately 4% of the total income of the Holy See during his pontificate.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munck. ''Europa XVII wieku''. Warszawa 1999, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; Borghese's personal revenues in 1610 were 153,000 ''scudi'' compared to the mere 4,900 ''scudi'' that constituted his entire family's income in 1592.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Gregory XIV]] (1590–1591) began the practice of creating cardinal-nephews whose formal appointment coincided ''de facto'' with their nomination, and was thus separate from the ordinal process for creating cardinals,&lt;ref name="s144" /&gt; and, when he fell ill, he authorized his cardinal-nephew, [[Paolo Emilio Sfondrato]], to use the ''[[Fiat ut petitur]]'', a power which was later diminished at the urging of the College.&lt;ref&gt;Tizon-Germe, Anne-Cécile, Levillain, ed., 2002, "Gregory XIV", p. 666.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul V issued a ''[[motu proprio]]'' on April 30, 1618, formally bestowing on his cardinal-nephew the same authority [[Pope Clement VIII]] had given to [[Pietro Aldobrandini]], beginning what historian Laurain-Portemer calls "l'age classique'" of [[nepotism]].&lt;ref&gt;Signorotto and Visceglia, 2002, p. 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ludovico Ludovisi with Gregory XV.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pope Gregory XV]] with his Cardinal Nephew of unprecedented income and authority, [[Ludovico Ludovisi]], known as ''il cardinale padrone''.]]
[[Pope Gregory XV]]'s (1621–1623) cardinal-nephew, [[Ludovico Ludovisi]], the first cardinal-nephew known as ''il cardinale padrone'' ("the Cardinal boss")&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 2004, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; accumulated a vast array of benefices: the bishopric of [[Bologna]], 23 [[abbey]]s, the directorship of the [[Apostolic Signatura]], as well as the offices of the vice-chancellor and high-chamberlain, and was able to have most of them redistributed among 17 of his kinsmen upon his death.&lt;ref name="h102" /&gt; These benefices and offices netted Ludovisi more than 200,000 [[scudi]] annually, and he is considered to have exercised "more unlimited authority" than any previous cardinal-nephew.&lt;ref&gt;von Rankle, Leopold. 1848. ''The History of the Popes''. p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, cardinal-nephews were allowed to create ''[[facultas testandi]]'' to will the rewards of their benefices to secular family members.&lt;ref name="h102" /&gt; Gregory XV's successor, [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (1623–1644) convened two special committees of theologians, both of whom endorsed this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Pope Urban VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Cardinal Nephews were cardinal-nephews in the strictest sense. In fact, papal historian Valérie Pirie considers not having a nephew a "tremendous asset for a would-be Pope" as it left the position open for an ally cardinal.&lt;ref name="vintro" /&gt; For example, [[Pope Clement X]] gave the office to Cardinal Paoluzzi-Altieri, whose nephew had recently married Laura Caterina Altieri, the sole heiress of Clement X's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Pope Clement X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians consider [[Olimpia Maidalchini]], the sister-in-law of [[Pope Innocent X]] (1644–1655), to have been a ''de facto'' Cardinal Nephew; the position was formally held by her son, [[Camillo Francesco Maria Pamphili|Camillo Pamphili]], then her nephew, [[Francesco Maidalchini]] (after Pamphili renounced his cardinalate in order to wed), and (after Francesco proved incompetent) [[Camillo Astalli]], her cousin.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1981, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boutry801" /&gt;

Popes often had only a few choices for the creation of a Cardinal Nephew. According to papal historian Frederic Baumgartner, [[Pope Sixtus V]]'s (1585–1590) reign "started badly" because [[Alessandro Peretti di Montalto]] was "his only nephew eligible for the office, but he could hardly serve the Pope as a trustworthy confidant", causing several cardinals to refuse to attend his investiture.&lt;ref name="Baumgartner, 2003, p. 130"&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Another papal historian [[Ludwig von Pastor]] notes that "the misfortune of Pope Pamphilj was that the only person in his family who would have had the qualities necessary to fill such a position was a woman".&lt;ref name="boutry801"&gt;Boutry, Philippe, Levillain, ed., 2002, "Innocent X", p. 801–802.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Innocent XI]] (1676–1689) despised the practice and only accepted his election as Pope after the [[College of Cardinals]] consented to his plans for reform, which included a ban on nepotism.&lt;ref name="bunson" /&gt; However, Innocent XI backed down after thrice failing to achieve the support of the majority of his cardinals for a bull banning nepotism,&lt;ref name="c304"&gt;Chadwick, 1981, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; which had been tediously composed between 1677 and 1686.&lt;ref name="l468"&gt;Rosa, Mario, Levillain, ed., 2002, "Curia", p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; Innocent XI refused entreaties from within the papal court to bring his only nephew, [[Livio Odescalchi]], the prince of [[Sirmio]], to Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Jeffrey Keyes. "[http://stedwardcatholic.org/stgasparhouse/docs/PAPA_08.pdf A YOUNG MAN IN THE ROME OF PIUS VII] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930100146/http://stedwardcatholic.org/stgasparhouse/docs/PAPA_08.pdf |date=September 30, 2007 }}". p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; although he did elevate Carlo Stefano Anastasio Ciceri, a distant relative, cardinal on September 2, 1686.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, Salvador. 1998. "[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1686.htm#Ciceri Consistory of September 2, 1686]."&lt;/ref&gt; Innocent XI's successor, [[Pope Alexander VIII]] (1689–1691), was the last Pope to create a Cardinal Nephew.&lt;ref name="bunson" /&gt; Alexander VIII also undid another reform of Innocent XI by restoring the revenues of the former [[Chancery of Apostolic Briefs|Chancery]] to the [[Vice-Chancellor]], who was, at the time, his cardinal-nephew, [[Pietro Ottoboni (cardinal)|Pietro Ottoboni]].&lt;ref name="curia"&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Roman Curia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edith Standen, a consultant to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], calls Ottoboni the "last and certainly not least magnificent example" of the "splendor of an extinct species, the Cardinal-Nephew".&lt;ref name="standen"&gt;Standen, Edith A. 1981. "Tapestries for a Cardinal-Nephew: A Roman Set Illustrating Tasso's "Gerusalemme Liberata". ''Metropolitan Museum Journal''. '''16''': 147–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1692 (and sometimes thereafter), the cardinal-nephew (or a lay nephew) would be the chief [[archive|archivist]] of the Pope, usually removing the archives to a family archive upon the death of the pontiff.&lt;ref&gt;Hansman, Silvia. 1999, Spring. "[http://www.auburn.edu/academic/classes/hist/0647/silbook.html The Vatican Secret Archives]". ''Seminar on Records and Archives in Society''.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the archival collections of the [[Barberini]], [[House of Farnese|Farnese]], [[Chigi-Albani|Chigi]], and [[House of Borghese|Borghese]] families contain important papal documents.&lt;ref name="c299" /&gt;

=== Since 1692 ===
[[File:Pope Innocent XII.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pope Innocent XII]] abolished the curial office of the Cardinal Nephew on June 22, 1692 and strengthened the office of [[Cardinal Secretary of State]]]]
[[Pope Innocent XII]] (1691–1700) issued a [[papal bull]] on June 22, 1692, ''[[Romanum decet pontificem]]'', banning the office of Cardinal Nephew, limiting his successors to elevating only one cardinal relative, eliminating various ''[[sinecure]]s'' traditionally reserved for cardinal-nephews, and capping the [[stipend]] or [[Financial endowment|endowment]] the nephew of a Pope could receive to 12,000 [[scudi]].&lt;ref name="nepotism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="c305" /&gt;&lt;ref name="standen" /&gt; ''Romanum decet pontificem'' was later incorporated into the [[Code of Canon Law of 1917]] in canons 240, 2; 1414, 4; and 1432, 1.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, Salvator. 1998. "[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/guide-xvii.htm Guide to documents and events (76–2005)]".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1694, Innocent XII's series of reforms was concluded with an expensive campaign to eliminate the "[[venality]]" of offices while reimbursing their current holders.&lt;ref name="l468" /&gt; These reforms are viewed by some scholars as a delayed reaction to the financial crisis created by the nepotism of [[Pope Urban VIII]] (1623–1644).&lt;ref name="nepotism" /&gt;
[[File:branschi-onesti.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Romualdo Braschi-Onesti, the penultimate cardinal-nephew]]
However, even following ''Romanum decet pontificem'', only three of the eight Popes of the 18th century failed to make a nephew or brother cardinal.&lt;ref name="c304" /&gt; The [[College of Cardinals]] apparently preferred rule by nephews than by favorites, which they perceived as the alternative; for example, the College urged [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (1724–1730) to appoint a cardinal-nephew, who they hoped would replace Benedict XIII's notorious lieutenant [[Niccolò Coscia]].&lt;ref name="c305"&gt;Chadwick, 1981, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Gregory XIII]] (1572–1585) also had to be urged by key figures in the College to appoint his cardinal-nephew: Filippo Boncompagni.&lt;ref name="s142"&gt;Signorotto and Visceglia, 2002, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cardinal-nephews of the 18th century declined in influence as the power of the [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] increased.&lt;ref name="c305" /&gt; The church of [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (1724–1730) is described by historian Eamon Duffy as "all the evils of nepotism without the nephew".&lt;ref name="wilcock1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duffy1"&gt;Duffy, Eamon. 2006.
"[https://books.google.com/books?id=yG7nWt2XIyEC&amp;pg=PA241 Saints &amp; sinners: a history of the Popes]".&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Neri Maria Corsini]], cardinal-nephew of [[Pope Clement XII]] (1730–1740) was by far the most powerful cardinal-nephew of the 18th century, on account of his uncle's advanced age and [[blindness]].&lt;ref name="c305" /&gt; However, Clement XII's successor, [[Pope Benedict XIV]] (1740–1758) was described by [[Hugh Walpole]] as "a priest without indolence or interest, a prince without favorites, a Pope without nephews".&lt;ref name="wilcock1"&gt;Wilcock, John. 2005.

[[File:Giuseppe Cardinal Pecci, SJ.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giuseppe Pecci]], the last papal relative elevated to cardinal]]
[[Romualdo Braschi-Onesti]], cardinal-nephew of [[Pope Pius VI|Pius VI]] (1775–1799), was the penultimate cardinal-nephew. Despite Pius VI's lineage to a noble [[Cesena]] family, his only sister had married a man from the poor Onesti family. Therefore, he commissioned a [[genealogy|genealogist]] to discover (and inflate) some trace of nobility in the Onesti lineage, an endeavor which yielded only a circuitous connection to Saint Romualdo.&lt;ref&gt;Pirie, Valérie. 1965.

After the turbulent [[papal conclave, 1800|1800 papal conclave]], [[Pope Pius VII]] (1800–1823) shunned the institution of the cardinal-nephew and instead relied on his [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], [[Ercole Consalvi]].&lt;ref&gt;Pirie, Valérie. 1965. "[http://www.pickle-publishing.com/papers/triple-crown-leo-xii.htm The Triple Crown: An Account of the Papal Conclaves: XIXth Century]". Spring Books. p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the only nephew of a Pope created cardinal was [[Gabriele della Genga Sermattei]], nephew of [[Pope Leo XII]], created cardinal by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] on February 1, 1836.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, Salvador. 1998. "[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1836.htm Consistory of February 1, 1836 (VIII)]".&lt;/ref&gt; Although the institutionalization of nepotism disappeared in the 18th century, "[[pietas]]" (duty to family) remained a theme of papal administration into the 20th century, although rarely with the overt intervention of a papal uncle.&lt;ref name="nepotism" /&gt; Following the example of Pius VI, Popes [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]] (who elevated his brother, [[Giuseppe Pecci]], cardinal on May 12, 1879) and [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]] (1939–1958) weakened the formal curial bureaucracy in favor of a parallel government, in which family members often figured prominently.&lt;ref name="nepotism" /&gt; The loss of [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] over the [[Papal States]] (''de facto'' in 1870 with the "[[Roman Question]]" and ''de jure'' in 1929 with the [[Lateran Treaty]]) also eliminated the structural conditions which had figured prominently in the family politics of earlier Popes.&lt;ref name="nepotism" /&gt;

== Role in conclaves ==
{{rquote|right|A Pope's nephew dies twice; the second time like all men, the first time when his uncle dies.|Cardinal Albani|&lt;ref name="c305" /&gt;}}

Even into the 18th century, the cardinal-nephew was a natural [[Power broker (term)|power broker]] at the [[papal conclave|conclave]] following his uncle's death, as a figure whom cardinals desirous of continuing the ''[[status quo]]'' could rally around.&lt;ref name="c305" /&gt; In particular, the cardinal-nephew often commanded the loyalty of his uncle's ''creatures'', whom he generally had a role in naming.&lt;ref name="b151"&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Alessandro Peretti di Montalto]] led his uncle's creatures in the papal conclave of 1590 despite being only 21.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; According to conclave historian Frederic Baumgartner, "the purpose of such appointments was ensuring that the Pope's family would have power and influence for a much longer time than the brief period that a Pope could expect to reign".&lt;ref name="Baumgartner, 2003, p. 130" /&gt; A notable exception is [[Pope Gregory XV]] (1621–1623) who declined on his death bed the request of [[Ludovico Ludovisi]] to name more relatives to the College, saying he had "enough to account to God for the unworthy ones he had appointed".&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Raffaello Sanzio - Ritratto di Leone X coi cardinali Giulio de' Medici e Luigi de' Rossi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pope Leo X]] with his cousins [[Pope Clement VII|Giulio de' Medici]] ''(left, the future Pope Clement VII)'' and Luigi de' Rossi ''(right)'', whom he appointed as cardinals]]
However, cardinal-nephews were not guaranteed the leadership of their uncle's ''creatures''; for example, in the [[papal conclave, 1621]], [[Scipione Borghese]] could count only twenty-nine votes (a fraction of his uncle's fifty-six cardinals), [[Pietro Aldobrandini]] controlled only nine (of his uncle's thirteen remaining cardinals), and Montalto only five of his uncle's remaining cardinals.&lt;ref name="b143"&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, international rivalries sometimes overwhelmed family loyalties when cardinal-nephews were relatively "poorly organized".&lt;ref name="b143" /&gt; As [[Pope Innocent X]] (1644–1655) died with the office of Cardinal Nephew vacant his faction proved divided and leaderless in the conclave, although his sister-in-law [[Olimpia Maidalchini]] was invited to address the cardinals from within the enclosure, the only woman ever so honored.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Instruzione al cardinal Padrone circa il modo come si deve procurare una fazione di cardinali con tutti i requisiti che deve avere per lo stabilimento della sua grandezza'' ("Instructions to the chief cardinal on how to create a faction of cardinals with all the requisites for the establishment of his grandeur"), discovered in the archive of the [[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli|Santa Maria de Monserrato]] offers advice to cardinal-nephews for consolidating power within the College of Cardinals.&lt;ref name="s114" /&gt; Another text, the ''Ricordi dati da Gregorio XV al cardinale Lodovisio suo nipote'' ("Memoir addressed by [[Pope Gregory XV|Gregory XV]] to his Nephew Cardinal Lodovisio") offers advice for how to rise within the Curia.&lt;ref name="s93"&gt;Signorotto and Visceglia, 2002, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the five papal conclaves between 1605 and 1644 shows that cardinal-nephews were generally unsuccessful in electing their chosen candidates, although the victor was usually a cardinal created by the deceased Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Signorotto and Visceglia, 2002, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crown-cardinal]]s in particular, when they deigned to travel to Rome for the conclave, tended to oppose the election of cardinal-nephews, although they equally opposed  the election of crown-cardinals of other monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a cardinal-nephew had to outlive one or more successors of his uncle to become regarded as ''[[papabile]]'', both because of their youth and their tendency to be blamed for any unpopular papal policies of their uncles.&lt;ref name="b151" /&gt;

A papal election could bring a dramatic change of fortune for a cardinal-nephew, often bringing the former favorites into conflict with the new Pope. For example, [[Prospero Colonna (cardinal)|Prospero Colonna]] and [[Francisco de Borja]] were [[excommunication|excommunicated]],&lt;ref name="Trollope, 1876, p. 138"&gt;Trollope, 1876, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, S. 1998. "[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1500-ii.htm#Borja Consistory of September 28, 1500 (IX)]". Florida International University.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carlo Carafa]] was [[List of people executed by the Holy See|executed]].&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, S. 1998. "[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1555.htm#Carafa Consistory of June 7, 1555 (I)]". Florida International University.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[papal conclave, May 1605]], is one example of a conclave where a candidate ([[Antonmaria Sauli]]) was defeated because enough other cardinals were convinced of the need for "a Pope willing to punish the cardinal-nephews for robbing the papacy".&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; A cardinal-nephew was also a potential threat to any future pontiff; for example, Ludovisi came to lead the opposition against [[Pope Urban VIII]] (1623–1644), even talking about calling a council against the Pope (which never occurred as Ludovisi died in 1632) because "no one else had the standing to confront Urban's titanic temper".&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tizian 065.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Ippolito de' Medici]], cardinal-nephew of [[Pope Clement VII]] and illegitimate son of [[Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici]]]]
[[Nepotism]] is a common feature in the history of governance, particularly in cultures where identity and loyalty are determined more at the level of the family than that of the [[nation-state]].&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1981, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of nephews, rather than direct descendants, is a product of the tradition of [[clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy within the Catholic Church]], although [[heredity|hereditary descent]] from uncles to nephews is also seen in the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|patriarchate]] of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1981, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of relatives and known-allies as cardinals was only one way in which medieval and Renaissance Popes attempted to dilute the power of the [[College of Cardinals]] as an "ecclesiastical rival" and perpetuate their influence within the church after their death.&lt;ref&gt;Hsia, 2005, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The institution of the cardinal-nephew had the effect both of enriching the Pope's family with desirable [[benefice]]s and of modernizing the administration of the papacy, by allowing the pontiff to rule through a proxy which was more easily deemed [[Papal infallibility|fallible]] when necessary and provided a formal distance between the person of the pontiff and the everydayness of pontifical affairs.&lt;ref name="nepotism" /&gt;

[[Gregorio Leti]]'s ''Papal Nepotism, or the True Relation of the Reasons Which Impel the Popes to make their Nephews Powerful'' (1667) is one example of contemporary criticism of the institution of the cardinal-nephew; Leti holds the rare distinction of having ''all'' of his publications on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' ("List of Prohibited Books").&lt;ref&gt;Ambrosini, Maria Luisa, and Willis, Mary. 1996. ''The Secret Archives of the Vatican''. Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7607-0125-3}}. p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' of 1913 defended the institution of the cardinal-nephew as a necessary countermeasure to the intrigue of the old Church.&lt;ref name="curia" /&gt; According to Francis A. Burkle-Young, 15th century Popes in particular found it necessary to elevate their relatives to the College of Cardinals due to their distrust of the [[crown-cardinal]]s, Roman baronial families, and Italian princely families who also populated the college.&lt;ref&gt;Burkle-Young, Francis. 1998. "[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/election-eugeniusiv.htm The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church: Papal elections in the Fifteenth Century: The election of Pope Eugenius IV (1431)]."&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Thomas Adolphus Trollope]], a famed papal historian, "the evil wrought by them in and to the church has been well nigh fatal to it; and it continued to increase until increasing danger warned the Pontiffs to abstain. The worst cardinals, providing, of course, the material for the worst Popes, have been for the most part cardinal nephews, the temptation to the creation of such having been rendered too great to be resisted by the exorbitant greatness of the power, dignity, and wealth attributed to the members of the Sacred College. The value of these great "prizes" was so enormous, that the "hat" became an object of ambition to princes, and it was the primary object with a long series of Popes to bestow it on their kinsmen."&lt;ref name="Trollope, 1876, p. 138" /&gt;

=== Cardinal Secretary of State ===
{{Main article|Cardinal Secretary of State}}
The curial office of [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] in many ways evolved from the roles formerly filled by cardinal-nephews. From 1644 to 1692, the power of the Cardinal Secretary of State was essentially inversely proportional to that of the Cardinal Nephew, to whom the Secretariat was subordinate.&lt;ref name="c299"&gt;Chadwick, 1981, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; During some pontificates, for example that of [[Pope Pius V]] (1566–1572) and his nephew [[Michele Bonelli]], the cardinal-nephew and secretary of state were one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;Setton, 1984, p. 912.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Baumgartner, "the rise of a centralized administration with professional bureaucrats with careers in the papal service" proved more effective than nepotism for future Popes and thus "greatly reduced the need for papal nephews".&lt;ref name="b166"&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the Cardinal Secretary of State was the "most obvious element of this new approach".&lt;ref name="b166" /&gt;

A '''''chargé d'affaires''''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁʒe dafɛʁ}}), often shortened to '''''chargé''''' (French) and sometimes to '''''charge-D''''' (abbreviated in colloquial English), is a [[diplomat]] who heads an embassy in the absence of the [[ambassador]]. The term is [[French language|French]] for "charged with (in charge of) matters". A female diplomat may be designated a '''''chargée d'affaires''''', following French [[declension]].

A ''chargé'' enjoys the same privileges and immunities as a regular ambassador.  However, ''chargés d'affaires'' are [[diplomatic rank|outranked]] by ambassadors and have lower precedence at formal diplomatic events.&lt;ref name="state_precedence"&gt;{{cite web|title=2 FAM 320 Precedence|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/84407.pdf|website=U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual|accessdate=20 March 2016|date=October 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010080534/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/84407.pdf#|archive-date=2015-10-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, a diplomat would only serve as a ''chargé d'affaires'' on a temporary basis in the absence of the ambassador.  In unusual situations, a ''chargé d'affaires'' may be appointed for an indefinite period, in cases where disputes between the two countries make it impossible or undesirable to send agents of a higher [[diplomatic rank]].

==Types of ''chargés''==

[[File:Chargé d’affaires ad interim (edited).JPG|thumb|An invitation from the Japanese chargé d'affaires in [[Iceland]].]]

''Chargés d'affaires'' ''[[ad interim]]'' ("a.i.") are those who temporarily head a diplomatic mission in the absence of the accredited head of that mission.  It is usual to appoint a counsellor or secretary of delegation to be ''chargé d'affaires'' ''ad interim'', and he is presented to the foreign minister of the receiving state by the former head of mission before he leaves his post.  ''Chargés d'affaires'' ''ad interim'' are not themselves deemed to be formally accredited, as they do not possess [[Letter of credence|diplomatic credentials]].&lt;ref name="boczek2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boczek|first=Boleslaw Adam|title=International Law: A Dictionary|year=2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810850781|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chargés d'affaires'' ''en pied'' ("e.p.") are appointed to be permanent heads of mission, in cases where the two countries lack ambassadorial-level relations.&lt;ref name="us_venezuela"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Relations With Venezuela|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35766.htm|website=Burean of Western Hemisphere Affairs, U.S. Department of State|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315125545/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35766.htm|archivedate=March 15, 2016|date=July 20, 2015|quote=There currently is no U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela; the U.S. Charge d'Affaires en pied is Lee McClenny.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denza|first1=Eileen|title=Diplomatic Law: Commentary on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198703969|page=99|quote=Chargés d'affaires ''ad interim'' are distinct from the 'chargés d'affaires accredited to Ministers for Foreign Affairs' who are listed under Article 14 of the Convention as forming the third class of heads of mission. The latter are often described as 'chargés d'affairs ''en pied'' ', and can be traced back to the eighteenth century 'agents'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are appointed by [[letter of credence|letters of credence]] from the foreign minister of the sending state to the foreign minister of the receiving state.  Chargés d'affaires ''en pied'' have [[Diplomatic rank|precedence]] over chargés d'affaires ''ad interim'', but are outranked by ambassadors.  They are sometimes referred to as chargés d'affaires ''ad hoc'' or ''en titre''.&lt;ref name="state_precedence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="freeman1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freeman, Jr.|first1=Charles W.|title=Diplomat's dictionary|date=1993|publisher=National Defense University Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780788125669|page=56|quote=Chargé d'Affaires: An officer in charge of an embassy who is not an ambassador, e.g., when the level of relations between two states has been lowered to below the ambassadorial level, and accredited to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, rather than to the chief of state. In such circumstances, termed ''Chargé d'Affaires ad hoc.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boczek2005"/&gt;

==Long-term ''chargé''-level relations==

In certain cases, a ''chargé d'affaires'' may be appointed for long periods, such as when a mission is headed by a non-resident ambassador who is accredited to multiple countries.  In addition, a mission may be downgraded from an ambassadorial to a ''chargé d'affaires'' level to show displeasure, yet avoid taking the extremely serious step of breaking diplomatic relations.  For example, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Thailand]] have not exchanged ambassadors since 1989, due to the still-unresolved [[Blue Diamond Affair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/09/19/national/Embassy-issues-another-angry-statement-30138286.html|title=Embassy issues another angry statement|work=nationmultimedia.com|quote=Mr. Nabil Ashri said that "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's goal on this issue stems directly from its firm and clear foreign policy of non-interference, and seeking closer cooperation and developing friendly international relations, as its relations with the Kingdom of Thailand suffered because of the appalling unsolved crimes currently pending and which have resulted in the downgrading of bilateral relations affecting both the people of Saudi Arabia and Thailand for more than 20 years", adding "it is my duty to try to negotiate this issue with the Thai Government, in order to avoid any further tension or undesirable complications in bilateral relations".|access-date=2013-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922105214/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/09/19/national/Embassy-issues-another-angry-statement-30138286.html|archive-date=2010-09-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When diplomatic recognition is extended to a new government, a ''chargé'' will be sent to immediately establish diplomatic representation.  However, if a timely exchange of ambassadors does not take place, this may result in a prolonged period of ''chargé''-level relations.  For example, the United Kingdom recognized the People's Republic of China in 1950 and posted a ''chargé d'affaires'' in the new capital of Beijing.  However, China was unwilling to exchange ambassadors until the United Kingdom withdrew its consulate from Taipei.  [[China–United Kingdom relations|Sino-British relations]] were not upgraded to the ambassadorial level until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=China (Exchange of Ambassadors) ||column_start=31 |column_end=35 |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1972/mar/13/china-exchange-of-ambassadors |date = 13 March 1972 |quote=When early last year we decided to resume discussions with the Chinese Government on this subject we told them that if an agreement on an exchange of ambassadors was reached we would be prepared to withdraw our consulate from Taiwan. This we shall now do.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a ''chargé d'affaires'' presents his or her [[letter of credence|credentials]] to the foreign minister rather than the head of state, the appointment of a ''chargé'' may avoid a politically sensitive meeting that would imply approval or recognition of that head of state or government.  Similarly, the receiving country may decline to receive an ambassador, but still maintain diplomatic relations by accepting a ''chargé''.  For example, the [[Republic of Cyprus]] appoints a number of ''chargés d'affaires'' ''en pied'' to its embassies abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyprus Diplomatic Missions Abroad|url=http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2006.nsf/protocol04_en/protocol04_en?OpenDocument|accessdate=19 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425230019/http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2006.nsf/protocol04_en/protocol04_en?OpenDocument|archive-date=25 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In modern use, ''chargés d'affaires'' do not essentially differ from [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]]s, [[Envoy (title)|envoy]]s or ministers resident. They represent their nation, and apart from [[diplomatic rank|rank and precedence]], enjoy the same privileges and immunities as other diplomatic agents.

However, there have been rare historical circumstances in which a diplomatic post, formally ranking as ''chargé d'affaires'', was in fact employed in a more significant colonial role, as commonly held by a [[resident (title)|resident]]. Thus, in Annam-Tonkin (most of present [[Vietnam]]), the first French ''chargé d'affaires'' at [[Huế]], the local ruler's capital, since 1875; one of them (three terms) was appointed the first [[resident-general]] on 11 June 1884, as they stopped being tributary to the Chinese Empire, less than a year after the 25 August 1883 French protectorates over Annam and Tonkin (central and northern regions).

In French usage, ''chargé d'affaires'' may be used outside diplomacy either as a specific position, or in general terms to indicate an individual with some more or less temporary responsibility for a specific area of activity.

==Spelling and grammar==
''Chargé d'affaires'' generally follows French usage: ''chargé d'affaires'' is singular, ''chargés d'affaires'' for plural. The ''"d'affaires"'' is always in the plural form, and should be lowercase even if ''Chargé'' is capitalized.  Following the French declension, ''chargée d'affaires'' (with the feminine ending) may be seen where the ''chargé'' is female.

For temporary ''chargés'', ''[[ad interim]]'' may or may not be added depending on the context, but is always lower case; it may be italicized or shortened to simply a.i.

The '''Crow Rate''', or '''Crowsnest Freight Rate''', was a rail transportation [[subsidy]] benefiting [[farmer]]s on the [[Canadian Prairies]] and manufacturers in Central Canada by rate requirements imposed on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) by the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[government of Canada|government]] in exchange for financing and other benefits.

==Origin==
In the late 19th century, mineral strikes in southeastern BC near Nelson, Ainsworth, Rossland, Kaslo, Kimberley and Moyie inspired [[United States|American]] rail interests to push lines northward, to rail out ore and to provide machinery and supplies needed for the development of local smelters.  Both the Canadian government and the CPR wanted an all-Canadian rail line to forestall this American access and to reassert Canadian sovereignty in the area.  A rail line was planned from [[Lethbridge, Alberta]] to Kootenay Landing near [[Nelson, British Columbia]] through the [[Crowsnest Pass]], which would also enable the development of [[coal]] deposits in the Pass and the Elk River valley, important both for mineral smelting operations and for the CPR's conversion of locomotives from wood to coal.&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Harvey ''Carving the Western Path, Routes to Remember'' Heritage House Publishing, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPR needed government funding and concessions for the construction of this rail line, and the negotiated agreement between the CPR and the Canadian government was contained in the "Crowsnest Pass Agreement" dated September 6, 1897.  Amongst other things, the CPR agreed to provide reduced rail rates for farmers' grain shipped east to the Great Lakes and for farm machinery shipped west from central Canada "forever".

The Crow Rate was suspended by the CPR during World War One and reinstated in 1922.

==End of "Forever"==
Although popular with farmers exporting grains, these reduced rates were not cost-effective for the railway and provided central Canadian manufacturers and grain ports with an unfair advantage.  By the early 1980s, the government attempted to resolve the problems between the competing interests by altering the agreement. The [[Western Grain Transportation Act]] of 1983 allowed shipping rates to increase, but never more than 10% of the world price for grain. In addition, further cash payments were made by the government to the CPR.

With the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|election]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[Jean Chrétien]] in 1993, the new government took steps to eliminate the subsidies altogether. This was implemented in 1995 through the Western Grain Transition Payment Program, which provided one-time payments to farmers to assist them in making the transition away from subsidized shipping.

'''Department for Protection and Security''' ('''DPS''') or '''''Département Protection et Sécurité''''' is the "security" branch of the [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]] (RN) [[political party]] of [[France]], which depends directly from the RN's president and is now led by Eric Staelens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontnational.com/organigrammes_autres.php Historique - Front National - Jean-Marie Le Pen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127015653/http://www.frontnational.com/organigrammes_autres.php |date=2007-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently headed by Eric Staelens and contains 1,500 men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontnational.com/organigrammes_autres.php Organigramme: Les autres services du FN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127015653/http://www.frontnational.com/organigrammes_autres.php |date=2007-11-27 }}, National Front website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The mission of the DPS is providing physical protection of the leaders of National Rally and the monitoring of events or meetings of the party. One feature of DPS compared to other political parties' security services is its quasi-military character, both in the origin of many of its members (former [[Military of France|military]], [[Police of France|police]] or [[security guard]]s) and in its equipment consisting of helmets and uniforms similar to those worn by the [[riot police|mobile brigades]] of law enforcement. There is a fairly strong tradition of red berets ([[Paratroops#France|Paratroops]]) and Green Berets ([[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]]).

== 1998 Parliamentary Commission on the acts of the DPS ==

In 1998, a Parliamentary Commission, led by [[French Socialist Party|Socialist MP]] [[Bernard Grasset (politician)|Bernard Grasset]] ([[Greens (France)|Green MP]] [[Noël Mamère]] and conservative MP [[Patrick Devedjian]] were also part of it)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembleenationale.fr/tribun/fiches_id/1124.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;, was created to investigate its acts, after several violent incidents during demonstrations and other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-reso/r0902.asp National Assembly report]&lt;/ref&gt; The report was published on 3 June 1999, and pinpointed several cases of DPS member checking [[French national identity card|identity card]] of demonstrators instead of the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Un 1er Mai sous haute surveillance | publisher=France Info | date=2002-04-29 | url=http://www.radiofrance.fr/chaines/france-info/chroniques/dossier/index.php?m=3&amp;chro_diff_id=3439&amp;imp=1 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040914154657/http://www.radiofrance.fr/chaines/france-info/chroniques/dossier/index.php?m=3&amp;chro_diff_id=3439&amp;imp=1 | archivedate=2004-09-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also pinpointed links with the ''[[Groupe Union Défense]]'' (GUD), former [[Organisation armée secrète|OAS]] members, [[mercenaries]] and [[private military contractors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confidentiel.net/mot.php3?id_mot=668 Confidentiel.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/dossiers/dps/r1622p02.asp National Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliamentary commission declared that the DPS should have been dissolved end of 1996, after the [[Montceau-les-Mines]] affair on 25 October 1996, when a DPS unit acted like an ordinary police order force, alike to the ''[[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité|C.R.S.]]'' anti-riot units. After the creation of the ''[[Mouvement National Républicain]]'' (MNR) by [[Bruno Mégret]], an offshoot from the RN, the DPS itself also split into two organizations, the DPS on one side and the DPA (''Département Protection Assistance'') on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=DPS : trop tard pour dissoudre selon les députés | publisher=L'Humanité |date=1999-06-04 | url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/1999-06-04/1999-06-04-290722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former member of the DPS has given a long interview to daily ''[[Libération]]''. Using the pseudonym "Dominique", he explained that the DPS has special "unofficial" intervention squads made up of former [[paratrooper]]s and [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legionnaires]], veterans of French interventions in [[Chad]], [[Lebanon]], and the [[Central African Republic]]. Some members of the DPS were present in covert operations in [[Zaire]] (1997 and 2001), [[Madagascar]] (in 2002, [[Didier Ratsiraka]] called for some mercenaries to resolve the political crisis [http://www.meinung.vaovao.net/forum_show.php?id=343]), [[Ivory Coast]] (2001–2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=En Afrique, une nouvelle génération de " chiens de guerre " | publisher=Le Monde Diplomatique |date=November 2004|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/11/LEYMARIE/11673}} (translations available in English and [[Persian language|Persian]])&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Voltaire Network|Voltaire network]], the DPS had been created with the help of [[Jacques Foccart]] and [[François de Grossouvre]] (leader of the French branch of [[Gladio]], NATO's secret armies) after the dissolving of the ''[[Service d'Action Civique]]'' (SAC).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071211214536/http://membres.lycos.fr/kominform/autres/consensus.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voltairenet.org/article7597.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bernard Courcelle's leadership until Bruno Mégret's scission ==

DPS is equipped with [[helmet]]s and [[shield]]s, [[gas mask]]s, [[tear gas]] launchers, guns that fire [[rubber bullet]]s, [[bulletproof vest]]s, [[Club (weapon)|club]]s, and gloves with lead weights. DPS is alleged to have compiled computerized lists of [[journalist]]s and [[anti-fascist]] activists with their names, addresses, and photos. They engage in punitive actions against their opponents but have, Dominique said, excellent relations with the [[police]], including the [[police commissioner]]s. They are organized in terms of [[military rank]]s such as [[colonel]] and [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]]. According to Liberation, the DPS now has 3,000 members. Since 1993, the group has been commanded  by [[Bernard Courcelle]], who claims, "We only defend ourselves. We never attack the meetings of other groups." According to ''[[Reporters Sans Frontières]]'', the DPS has records on [[journalist]]s who follow the National Rally's activities and, on several occasions, was responsible for the beating up of reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Les violences de l’extrême droite contre la presse, un danger à prendre au sérieux | publisher=Reporters Sans Frontières | date=2002-06-21 | url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=2649 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025041904/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=2649 | archivedate=2005-10-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Bruno Mégret]]'s split, Bernard Courcelle followed him with 1,700 men from the DPS, and Jean-Marie Le Pen named Marc Bellier to fill his place, and then Jean-Pierre Chabrut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Le chef du DPS ira à Marignane | publisher=L'Humanité |date=1999-01-22 | url=http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1999-01-22/1999-01-22-441929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Bernard Courcelle was a member, along with [[Bruno Gollnisch]], of the ''[[Direction de la Protection de la Sécurité et de la Défense]]'' ([[DPSD]]), an official [[French Ministry of Defence|Ministry of Defence]] organization in charge of recruiting [[mercenaries]] and informing on weapons traffic. The DPSD allegedly has or had ties, between the two wars, with the terrorist group ''[[La Cagoule]]''. In 1983, Bernard Courcelle allegedly created a [[mercenary]] firm with his brother. The next year, he became the former security director of the French armaments manufacturer, [[Luchaire]]. In 1989, he was in charge of security for the [[Musée d'Orsay]], which responsibility was assumed by none other than [[Anne Pingeot]], president [[François Mitterrand]]'s secret [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. In 1993, Courcelle became the leader of the DPS, before becoming in 1999 the leader of [[Republic of the Congo]]'s president [[Denis Sassou-Nguesso]]'s personal guard. He then takes charge of the security of the oil company [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf]]'s infrastructures in [[Pointe-Noire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Le Crime continue | publisher=Survie NGO | year=2000 | url=http://www.survie-france.org/article.php3?id_article=165 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106155812/http://www.survie-france.org/article.php3?id_article=165 | archivedate=2006-01-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''E numbers''' are codes for substances that are permitted to be used as [[food additive]]s for use within the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food labels|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/food-labelling.aspx |work=Live Well|publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1995L0002:20060815:EN:PDF European Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]]. The "E" stands for "Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-are-e-numbers-and-should-you-avoid-them-in-your-diet-43908|title=Explainer: what are E numbers and should you avoid them in your diet?|last=Snelson|first=Matthew|work=The Conversation|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly found on [[food label]]s, their safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the [[European Food Safety Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faia.org.uk/faq2_4.php Food Additives and Ingredients Association], no date, ''Frequently Asked Questions'', accessed 6 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Having a single unified list for food additives was first agreed upon in 1962 with [[food colouring]]. In 1964, the directives for preservatives were added, 1970 for antioxidants and 1974 for the emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodlaw.rdg.ac.uk/additive.htm Food Additives in the European Union]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbering schemes==
The numbering scheme follows that of the [[International Numbering System for Food Additives|International Numbering System]] (INS) as determined by the ''[[Codex Alimentarius]]'' committee&lt;ref name=ncsi&gt;{{cite web | last = [[Codex Alimentarius]] | title = Class Names and the International Numbering System for Food Additives (Ref: CAC/GL #36 publ. 1989, revised 2009, amended 2011)| url = http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/7/CXG_036e.pdf | accessdate = 15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though only a subset of the INS additives are approved for use in the European Union as food additives. Outside the European continent plus Russia, E numbers are also encountered on food labelling in other jurisdictions, including the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]], South Africa, Australia, New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/Additives%20alpha.pdf Food Standards Australia New Zealand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406040011/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/Additives%20alpha.pdf |date=6 April 2011 }}, website&lt;/ref&gt;, Malaysia, and [[Israel]]. They are increasingly, though still rarely, found on North American packaging&lt;ref&gt;See also "[http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/default.htm Food Additives]", Food and Drug Administration website&lt;/ref&gt;, especially on imported European products.

==Colloquial use==
In some European countries, "E number" is sometimes used informally as a pejorative term for artificial food additives, and products may promote themselves as "free of E numbers". This is incorrect, because many components of natural foods have assigned E numbers (and the number is a synonym for the chemical component), e.g. [[vitamin C]] ([[Ascorbic acid|E300]]) and [[lycopene]] ([[E160d]]), found in [[carrot]]s.

Among the later notable individuals involved in FSFO was [[Phil Gawne]], who later become Minister of Agriculture.

In 1991, FSFO issued a press release through the Manx nationalist paper ''[[Yn Pabyr Seyr]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The 31st of March saw the first anniversary of the F.S.F.O. campaigners' release from prison custody and although the destruction of the Manks way of life has apparently slowed down this past year, it is still continuing at an unacceptable and unnecessary rate. Since the boom began over three years ago, the Government has done nothing to protect the unique Manks lifestyle from the effects of the massive influx of new residents, and it seems that the direct message of F.S.F.O. is, unfortunately, far from being history. ... Complacency and "traa dy liooar" continue to offer the Government guarantees that it is safe for it to sell off whatever it likes and that the Manks people may be indefinitely walked over. ... In short, the aim of the campaign is to put economic power back in the hands of the Manks people, where it belongs. The time has now come to say "Enough is Enough" to the men of greed and close the door on finance sector led development.''&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mecvannin.im/pabyr/pb1.html#3 '' FSFO - NAIVE OR FAR SIGHTED?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7305">'''Fascist mysticism''' (Italian: ''Mistica fascista'') was a current of political and religious thought in Fascist Italy, based on [[Fideism]],&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Emilio Longo, I vincitori della guerra perduta (sezione su Niccolò Giani), Edizioni Settimo sigillo, Roma, 2003, pag.81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930-1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930-1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.123&lt;/ref&gt; a belief that faith existed without reason, and that Fascism should be based on a mythology and spiritual [[mysticism]]. A [[School of Fascist Mysticism]] was founded in [[Milan]] on April 10, 1930 and active until 1943, and its main objective was the training of future Fascist leaders, indoctrinated in the study of various Fascist intellectuals who tried to abandon the purely political to create a spiritual understanding of Fascism. Fascist mysticism in Italy developed through the work of [[Niccolò Giani]] with the decisive support of [[Arnaldo Mussolini]].

==Definition==
Niccolò Giani took the definition of mysticism from the writing of French philosopher [[Louis Rougier]]: {{blockquote|Mysticism is a set of propositions which adheres to tradition or sentiment, even if these propositions cannot be justified rationally and very often forgetting the primary reasons that led to state them. |[[Louis Rougier]] in Niccolò Giani in ''La marcia sul mondo'', October 9-October 15, 1932&lt;ref&gt;Niccolò Giani, La marcia sul mondo, Novantico Editore, Pinerolo, 2010, pag.43&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In line with Rougier, Giani stressed in his manifesto for the [[School of Fascist Mysticism]],'' "that fascism has its 'mystical' aspect, as it postulates a complex of moral, social and political, categorical and dogmatic beliefs, accepted and not questioned by the masses and minorities ... [A Fascist] puts his belief in the infallible Duce Benito Mussolini, the fascist and creator of civilization; [a Fascist] denies that anything outside of the Duce has spiritual or putative antecedents.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Grandi, ''Gli eroi di Mussolini. Niccolò Giani e la Scuola di mistica fascista'', Milano, Rizzoli (Edizioni BUR), 2004, pag.32&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the School was made to allow his followers to devote themselves fully to the worship of Mussolini, meditating on the writings and speeches of Mussolini,&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. a tale proposito Emilio Gentile, ''Il culto del littorio, la sacralizzazione della politica nell'Italia fascista, Bari-Roma, Laterza, 1993, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; and living according to his words, in a spirit of absolute loyalty and unquestioningly, as specified in the article "Fascist mysticism" in the Political Dictionary edited by the [[National Fascist Party]] in 1940: {{blockquote|In this sense "mystical fascism" means belief in the absolute truth of the doctrine established by the Duce and the same belief in the necessity of this doctrine, as a way of greatness and power of the nation (...). With this fascist mysticism is called the preparation for more energetic action and more on which the ideals of Fascist statements tend to translate into reality ... The mystical fascism ... can best be described as the Fascist action determined by a stronger faith in the absolute truth of Fascist propositions. In this sense we can understand how one can speak of a mystical part of the Fascist doctrine or the best of the doctrine of Fascism, and how to prepare a school that is appropriate and addresses the best part of the Italian youth towards this mysticism, that is, towards this "more fascist" action. | From the Dictionary of Politics, edited by the National Fascist Party, Vol III, p. 185 to 186, Rome 1940}}

The use of the term "mysticism" provoked hostility from the Roman Catholic Church, which used the term in the sense of being strictly limited to the spiritual sphere, without any political influence.&lt;ref&gt;Giacomo De Antonellis, Come doveva essere il perfetto giovane fascista, su storia illustrata n° 243 del febbraio 1978, pag 50&lt;/ref&gt; But in Giani's conception of mysticism, he claimed it was in the political sphere without fear of overlap between the two worlds. Giani stated: "Neither the Church should make policy, nor the State must make religion. Fascist Catholics, therefore, Catholics, or fascists, whichever is more like it, but Fascists: ''let us remember''."&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930-1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.129&lt;/ref&gt; The Bishop [[Onofrio Buonocore]] stated that he viewed Fascist mysticism as "the testimony of an Italy no longer divided, but renewed and reconciled under the papal insignia and littoriali".&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930-1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.145&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1937, the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] of Milan, [[Ildefonso Schuster]], gave a speech at the [[School of Fascist Mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930-1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.144&lt;/ref&gt; Many years of friction took place between the Catholic Church and the Fascist Regime, erupting into open conflict in 1931, after Mussolini's withdrawal of several concessions his regime made to the Catholic Church in a 1929 Concordat.

==The protagonists==
While considering the Fascist mysticism a "trend of thought" there are only contributions made by Italian thinkers, although they quoted  Rougier,  [[Albert Sorel]] and [[Henri Bergson]], cited by [[Nino Tripodi]] even if they were important in predetermining a state of mind in young mystics rather than provide guidance. According to the philosopher [[Enzo Paci]], Fascist mysticism was influenced by [[Nietzsche]] and Sorel, as was much of the culture of the period:
{{blockquote|Nietzsche and Sorel have been and remain the true masters of our culture, that of our political doctrine | [[Enzo Paci]]&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930-1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.131&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The principles of mystical fascism were largely formulated by [[Niccolo Giani]] and a small group of young Fascists bound to the teachers at the School of Fascist Mysticism (including [[Guido Pallotta]] and [[Berto Ricci]]), some high-ranking (including [[Ferdinand Mezzasoma]], [[Giuseppe Bottai]]), by writers and journalists of proven Fascist faith ([[Telesio Interlandi]], [[Virginio Gayda]]) and [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Benito Mussolini in ''Giornale della gioventù fascista'', 10 luglio 1932&lt;/ref&gt; It ultimately traced the cultural lines that were followed in the development of "Fascist"  disciplines and guidelines pertaining to the policies of the [[School of Fascist Mysticism]]. Around this core of "hard" high-profile intellectuals revolved others, including [[Paolo Orano]], [[Luigi Stefanini]] (who was an official consultant to the [[School of Fascist Mysticism]]) and [[Julius Evola]], and [[Giovanni Gentile]] and his student and friend [[Armando Carlini]], but Carlini seems to have had a rather marginal role in Fascist "mysticism".

'''Yoshihiro Francis Fukuyama''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|uː|k|uː|ˈ|j|ɑː|m|ə}}; born October 27, 1952) is an American [[Political science|political scientist]], [[Political economy|political economist]], and [[author]]. Fukuyama is known for his book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992), which argued that the worldwide spread of [[liberal democracies]] and free market [[capitalism]] of the West and its lifestyle may signal the end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and become the final form of human government. However, his subsequent book ''Trust: Social Virtues and Creation of Prosperity'' (1995) modified his earlier position to acknowledge that culture cannot be cleanly separated from economics. Fukuyama is also associated with the rise of the [[neoconservative]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;Thies, Clifford (2011-06-24) [https://mises.org/daily/5377/The-End-of-Hystery-Francis-Fukuyamas-Review-of-The-Constitution-of-Liberty The End of Hystery?

Fukuyama has been a [[senior fellow]] at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies since July 2010 and a Mosbacher Director of the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="fsi.stanford"&gt;{{cite web|title=Francis Fukuyama|url=http://fsi.stanford.edu/people/fukuyama/|work=Francis Fukuyama|publisher=Stanford Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, he served as a professor and director of the International Development program at [[Paul H.

Previously, he was Omer L. and Nancy Hirst Professor of Public Policy at the School of Public Policy at [[George Mason University]].&lt;ref name="fsi.stanford" /&gt;

He is a council member of the [[International Forum for Democratic Studies]] founded by the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] and was a member of the Political Science Department of the [[RAND Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ned.org/research/research-council/francis-fukuyama |title=Francis Fukuyama – International Forum for Democratic Studies Research Council Member |publisher=National Endowment for Democracy |accessdate=23 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708015045/http://www.ned.org/research/research-council/francis-fukuyama |archivedate=July 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He earned his Ph.D. in political science at Harvard for his [[thesis]] on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threats to intervene in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=wroe/&gt;&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt; In 1979, he joined the global policy think tank [[RAND Corporation]].&lt;ref name=wroe/&gt;

Fukuyama lived at the [[Telluride House]] and has been affiliated with the [[Telluride Association]] since his undergraduate years at Cornell, an education enterprise that was home to other significant leaders and intellectuals, including [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Paul Wolfowitz]] and [[Kathleen Sullivan]].

Fukuyama was the Omer L. and Nancy Hirst Professor of Public Policy in the School of Public Policy at [[George Mason University]] from 1996 to 2000. Until July 10, 2010, he was the [[Bernard L. Schwartz]] Professor of International Political Economy and Director of the International Development Program at the [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]] in Washington, D.C. He is now Olivier Nomellini Senior Fellow and resident in the [[Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law]] at the [[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies]] at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

==Writings==
Fukuyama is best known as the author of ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', in which he argued that the progression of human history as a struggle between ideologies is largely at an end, with the world settling on [[liberal democracy]] after the end of the [[Cold War]] and the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989. Fukuyama predicted the eventual global triumph of political and economic liberalism:

{{quote|What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such.... That is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.}}

Authors like [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] argued in 1990 that the essay gave Fukuyama his [[15 minutes of fame]], which will be followed by a slide into obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;Dahrendorf (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=obx2BX91FQUC&amp;pg=PA37 ''Reflections on the revolution in Europe''] p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Luciano Canfora]] [http://temi.repubblica.it/micromega-online/la-grande-illusione-del-capitalismo-eterno/ ''La grande illusione del capitalismo eterno''] preface to Ercolani, Paolo ''La storia infinita. Marx, il liberalismo e la maledizione di Nietzsche'' quotation: {{quote|Quanto detto sin qui può forse bastare a non prendere sul serio saggi troppo fortunati (ma già quasi avviati al dimenticatoio) come La fine della storia del nippo-statunitense Fukuyama. Libro che, comunque, è stato ampiamente stroncato per le sciocchezze che contiene: e non già da tardi epigoni del marxismo-leninismo, ma da filosofi 'liberal' come Dahrendorf, il quale ha anche avuto il buon senso di elencare gli errori di fatto (tali da mettere in forse il conseguimento della "maturità classica"!) che il troppo fortunato libretto contiene.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to remain a relevant and cited [[public intellectual]] leading American [[communitarianism|communitarian]] [[Amitai Etzioni]] to declare him "one of the few enduring public intellectuals. They are often media stars who are eaten up and spat out after their 15 minutes. But he has lasted."&lt;ref name="guardianprofile"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/11/academicexperts.artsandhumanities |title=History's Pallbearer |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=May 10, 2002 |last=Wroe |first=Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fukuyama, one of the main reasons for the massive criticism against ''The End of History'' was the aggressive stance that it took towards [[postmodernism]]. Postmodern philosophy had, in Fukuyama's opinion, undermined the ideology behind liberal democracy, leaving the western world in a potentially weaker position.&lt;ref&gt;'Francis Fukuyama, "Reflections on the End of History, Five Years Later", ''History and Theory'' 34, 2: "World Historians and Their Critics" (May 1995): 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Marxism and fascism had been proven untenable for practical use while liberal democracy still thrived was reason enough to embrace the hopeful attitude of the Progressive era, as this hope for the future was what made a society worth struggling to maintain. Postmodernism, which, by this time, had become embedded in the cultural consciousness, offered no hope and nothing to sustain a necessary sense of community, instead relying only on lofty intellectual premises.&lt;ref&gt;'Francis Fukuyama, "Reflections on the End of History, Five Years Later", ''History and Theory'' 34, 2: World Historians and Their Critics (May 1995): 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Being a work that both praised the ideals of a group that had fallen out of favor and challenged the premises of the group that had replaced them, it was bound to create some controversy.

Fukuyama has written a number of other books, among them ''Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity'' and ''[[Our Posthuman Future|Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution]]''. In the latter, he qualified his original "end of history" thesis, arguing that since biotechnology increasingly allows humans to control their own [[evolution]], it may allow humans to alter [[human nature]], thereby putting liberal democracy at risk.&lt;ref&gt;For a critical analysis of Fukuyama's bioethical argument, see: {{Cite journal | last1 = Jordaan | first1 = D. W. | title = Antipromethean Fallacies: A Critique of Fukuyama's Bioethics | doi = 10.1089/blr.2009.9915 | journal = Biotechnology Law Report | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 577–590 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible outcome could be that an altered human nature could end in radical inequality. He is a fierce enemy of [[transhumanism]], an intellectual movement asserting that [[posthuman]]ity is a desirable goal.

In another work, ''The Great Disruption: Human Nature and the Reconstruction of Social Order'', Fukuyama explores the origins of social norms, and analyses the current disruptions in the fabric of our moral traditions, which he considers as arising from a shift from the manufacturing to the information age. This shift is, he thinks, normal and will prove self-correcting, given the intrinsic human need for social norms and rules.

In 2006, in ''[[America at the Crossroads]]'', Fukuyama discusses the history of neoconservatism, with particular focus on its major tenets and political implications. He outlines his rationale for supporting the Bush administration, as well as where he believes it has gone wrong.

In 2008, Fukuyama published the book ''Falling Behind: Explaining the Development Gap Between Latin America and the United States'', which resulted from research and a conference funded by Grupo Mayan to gain understanding on why Latin America, once far wealthier than North America, fell behind in terms of development in only a matter of centuries. Discussing this book at a 2009 conference, Fukuyama outlined his belief that inequality within Latin American nations is a key impediment to growth. An unequal distribution of wealth, he stated, leads to social upheaval, which then results in stunted growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devex.com/blogs/17/blogs_entries/59071|title=Fukuyama: "Social Agenda" Needed to Combat Poverty in Latin America|author=Ryan Weddle|work=[[Devex]]|date=2009-02-18|accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoconservatism===
As a key [[Reagan Administration]] contributor to the formulation of the [[Reagan Doctrine]], Fukuyama is an important figure in the rise of [[neoconservatism]], although his works came out years after [[Irving Kristol]]'s 1972 book crystallized neoconservatism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Kristol]] (1972), ''On the Democratic Idea in America'', New York: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama was active in the [[Project for the New American Century]] think tank starting in 1997, and as a member co-signed the organization's 1998 [[Project for the New American Century#Open letter to President Clinton on Iraq|letter]] recommending that [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] support Iraqi insurgencies in the overthrow of then-President of [[Iraq]] [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref name=PNACClinton&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909200819/http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm| archivedate=September 9, 2008| title=Letter to President Clinton on Iraq| accessdate=2008-08-16| author=[[Elliott Abrams|Abrams, Elliott]]| date=1998-01-26| format=PDF| display-authors=etal| deadurl=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also among forty co-signers of [[Bill Kristol|William Kristol's]] September 20, 2001 letter to President [[George W. Bush]] after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] that suggested the U.S. not only "capture or kill [[Osama bin Laden]]", but also embark upon "a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Letter to President Bush on the War on Terrorism | url = http://www.newamericancentury.org/Bushletter.htm | website = [[Project for the New American Century]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041230063728/http://www.newamericancentury.org/Bushletter.htm | archivedate = 2004-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article from February 2006, Fukuyama, in considering the ongoing [[Iraq War]], stated: "What American foreign policy needs is not a return to a narrow and cynical realism, but rather the formulation of a 'realistic Wilsonianism' that better matches means to ends."&lt;ref name="nyt2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/magazine/neo.html?pagewanted=6&amp;sq=Francis%20Fukuyama&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=2|title=After Neoconservatism |date=2006-02-19|work=The New York Times | first=Francis | last=Fukuyama | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to neoconservatism he went on to say: "What is needed now are new ideas, neither neoconservative nor realist, for how America is to relate to the rest of the world – ideas that retain the neoconservative belief in the universality of human rights, but without its illusions about the efficacy of American power and hegemony to bring these ends about."&lt;ref name="nyt2006"/&gt;

===Current views===
Fukuyama began to distance himself from the neoconservative agenda of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], citing its excessive militarism and embrace of unilateral armed intervention, particularly in the Middle East. By late 2003, Fukuyama had voiced his growing opposition to the [[Iraq War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.anu.edu.au/sss/pols3017/Recent%20Articles/The%20Neoconservative%20Moment%20Fukuyama.pdf|title=The Neoconservative Moment|author=Francis Fukuyama|work=[[The National Interest]]|date=2004-06-01|accessdate=2007-05-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610221956/http://arts.anu.edu.au/sss/pols3017/Recent%20Articles/The%20Neoconservative%20Moment%20Fukuyama.pdf|archivedate=June 10, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s resignation as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zaman.com/?bl=international&amp;alt=&amp;trh=20040714&amp;hn=10372|date=2004-07-14|accessdate=2007-05-13|title=Fukuyama Withdraws Bush Support|work=[[Today's Zaman (newspaper)|Today's Zaman]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613212459/http://www.zaman.com/?bl=international&amp;alt=&amp;trh=20040714&amp;hn=10372|archivedate=June 13, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an annual dinner of the American Enterprise Institute in February 2004, [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Charles Krauthammer]] declared the beginning of a [[Polarity in international relations#Unipolarity|unipolar]] era under American [[hegemony]]. "All of these people around me were cheering wildly,"&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;{{cite news |last=Bast |first=Andrew |title=The Beginning of History |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/04/10/the-beginning-of-history.html |accessdate=May 5, 2011 |newspaper=[[Newsweek]] |date=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama remembers. He believes that the Iraq War was being blundered. "All of my friends had taken leave of reality."&lt;ref name=Newsweek /&gt; He has not spoken to [[Paul Wolfowitz]] (previously a good friend) since.&lt;ref name=Newsweek /&gt;

Fukuyama declared he would not be voting for Bush,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article456505.ece |author=Andrew Billen |date=2004-07-14 |accessdate=2007-05-13 |title=Why I won't vote for George Bush |location=London |work=The Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Bush administration had made three mistakes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Francis Fukuyama on Neo-Cons, Foreign Policy|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5239049|publisher=NPR|date=March 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overstating the threat of [[Islamic extremism]] to the US
* Failing to foresee the fierce negative reaction to its "benevolent hegemony". From the very beginning showing a negative attitude toward the United Nations and other [[intergovernmental organization]]s and not seeing that it would increase [[anti-Americanism]] in other countries
* Misjudging what was needed to bring peace in [[Iraq]] and being overly optimistic about the success with which [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] of western values could be applied to Iraq and the Middle East in general.

Fukuyama believes the US has a right to promote its own values in the world, but more along the lines of what he calls "realistic [[Wilsonianism]]", with military intervention only as a last resort and only in addition to other measures. A latent military force is more likely to have an effect than actual deployment. The US spends 43% of [[List of countries by military expenditures|global military spending]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/15majorspenders |title=The 15 countries with the highest military expenditure in 2009 |accessdate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Iraq shows there are limits to its effectiveness.

The US should instead stimulate political and economic development and gain a better understanding of what happens in other countries. The best instruments are setting a good example and providing education and, in many cases, money. The secret of development, be it political or economic, is that it never comes from outsiders, but always from people in the country itself. One thing the US proved to have excelled in during the aftermath of [[World War II]] was the formation of international institutions. A return to support for these structures would combine American power with international legitimacy. But such measures require a lot of patience. This is the central thesis of his 2006 work ''[[America at the Crossroads]]''.

In a 2006 essay in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' strongly critical of the invasion, he identified neoconservatism with [[Leninism]]. He wrote that neoconservatives:&lt;ref name="After Neoconservatism"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/magazine/neo.html?ex=1298005200&amp;en=4126fa38fefd80de&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|title=After Neoconservatism|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=2006-02-19|accessdate=2007-05-13|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|believed that history can be pushed along with the right application of power and will. Leninism was a tragedy in its Bolshevik version, and it has returned as farce when practiced by the United States. Neoconservatism, as both a political symbol and a body of thought, has evolved into something I can no longer support.}}

Fukuyama announced the end of the neoconservative moment and argued for the demilitarization of the [[War on Terrorism]]:&lt;ref name="After Neoconservatism" /&gt;

{{quote|[W]ar is the wrong metaphor for the broader struggle, since wars are fought at full intensity and have clear beginnings and endings. Meeting the jihadist challenge is more of a "long, twilight struggle" [quoting [[Inauguration of John F. Kennedy#The inaugural address|John F. Kennedy's inaugural address]]] whose core is not a military campaign but a political contest for the hearts and minds of ordinary Muslims around the world.}}

Fukuyama endorsed [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US presidential election]]. He states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2008/nov/03/00020//|title=Francis Fukuyama|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=2008-11-03|accessdate=2008-10-30|work=[[The American Conservative]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I'm voting for Barack Obama this November for a very simple reason. It is hard to imagine a more disastrous presidency than that of George W. Bush. It was bad enough that he launched an unnecessary war and undermined the standing of the United States throughout the world in his first term. But in the waning days of his administration, he is presiding over a collapse of the American financial system and broader economy that will have consequences for years to come. As a general rule, democracies don't work well if voters do not hold political parties accountable for failure. While [[John McCain]] is trying desperately to pretend that he never had anything to do with the Republican Party, I think it would be a travesty to reward the Republicans for failure on such a grand scale.}}

In a 2018 interview with ''[[New Statesman]]'', when asked about his views on the resurgence of [[socialist]] politics in the United States and Great Britain, he responded:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2018/10/francis-fukuyama-interview-socialism-ought-come-back|title=Francis Fukuyama interview: “Socialism ought to come back”|author= George Eaton|date=2018-10-17|accessdate=2018-10-17|work=New Statesman America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It all depends on what you mean by socialism. Ownership of the means of production – except in areas where it’s clearly called for, like public utilities – I don’t think that’s going to work. If you mean redistributive programmes that try to redress this big imbalance in both incomes and wealth that has emerged then, yes, I think not only can it come back, it ought to come back. This extended period, which started with Reagan and Thatcher, in which a certain set of ideas about the benefits of unregulated markets took hold, in many ways it’s had a disastrous effect. At this juncture, it seems to me that certain things Karl Marx said are turning out to be true. He talked about the crisis of overproduction… that workers would be impoverished and there would be insufficient demand.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2309">The '''French Parliamentary Commission on [[Rwanda]]''' was invested in the beginning of 1998, following a press-led campaign and articles by [[journalist]] Patrick de Saint-Exupéry in the Figaro newspaper, which called for an examination into the role of the French government in the events surrounding the 1994 [[genocide in Rwanda]]. The Belgian Senate undertook a similar initiative in 1997.

The French deputies decided to examine French policy in Rwanda between 1990 and 1994. For the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic, the Assembly examined events related to the "reserved domains" of the President of the Republic, in other words, functions of government historically seen as the exclusive realm of presidential authority. Composed of members of the Foreign Relations Parliamentary Committee and the National Defence and Armed Forces Parliamentary Committee, this mission was thus an expression of a renewed intent of parliamentarians to extend the democratic field of the Parliament.

The commission was presided over by Paul Quilès, and the hearings took place between March 24 and July 9, 1998. In connection with the inquiry, the committee members spent two days in Rwanda, visiting the [[Murambi]] memorial and meeting with Rwandan officials and private organizations. Entitled "Report of the Information Mission of the National Defense and Armed Forces Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee on the military operations led by France, other countries and the United Nations in Rwanda between 1990 and 1994", the final report was published on December 15, 1998 [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dossiers/rwanda/rapport.asp].

With [[Ehud Olmert]] as party chairman following Sharon's stroke, it became the largest party in the [[Knesset]] after the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]], winning 29 of the 120 seats, and led a coalition government. Although Kadima also won the most seats in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 elections]] under [[Tzipi Livni]]'s leadership, it became an opposition party for the first time after a Likud-led government was formed. Livni was defeated in the [[Kadima leadership election, 2012|2012 leadership election]], losing out to the more conservative [[Shaul Mofaz]]. Following Livni's defeat, the party's progressive wing broke away at the end of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jonathan Lis |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/kadima-s-left-flank-delays-schism-due-to-problems-in-recruiting-enough-mks-1.453405 |title=Kadima's left flank delays schism due to problems in recruiting enough MKs |newspaper=Haaretz |date=25 July 2012 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jonathan Lis |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/haim-ramon-seeking-to-form-kadima-breakaway-faction-under-livni-s-leadership-sources-say-1.453151 |title=Haim Ramon seeking to form Kadima breakaway faction under Livni's leadership, sources say |newspaper=Haaretz |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gil Hoffman |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Kadima-not-splitting-for-now |title=Kadima not splitting – for now |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=19 July 2012 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form a new centre-left party, [[Hatnuah]], which Livni led from the outset. In the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 elections]], Kadima became the smallest party in the Knesset, winning only 2 seats and barely passing the electoral threshold. It did not enter the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 elections]].

To date, it is the only party other than [[Mapai]]/[[Israeli Labour Party|Labour]] or [[Likud]] to have led a government in Israel.

==History==

===Background===
Prior to Kadima's formation, the political tug-of-war between [[Ariel Sharon]] and his right-wing supporters, both within the Likud and outside of it, was an ongoing subject of speculation in Israeli politics and in the Israeli media. The expectation that Sharon would leave his own party to form a new party composed of his Likud allies and open the door to politicians from other parties to switch to the new party was dubbed the "big bang" (''HaMapatz HaGadol'') because it would result in a radical realignment of Israel's political landscape.

A number of complex factors contributed to Sharon's decision to split from the Likud. After the official split from the party, Sharon claimed it was a decision made on a single night's thought, but at the press conference announcing the formation of the new party, Sharon adviser and Kadima's new Director General, Avigdor Yitzhaki, accidentally revealed that work on the project had been going on for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ronny Sofer |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/1,7340,L-3174538,00.html |title=Adviser reveals PM planned split months ago |publisher=Ynetnews |date=24 November 2005 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past Sharon had switched between left- and right-wing politics: having been a [[Mapai]] member, he joined Likud in the early 1970s, before leaving the party. After acting as a special advisor to [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] PM [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in the mid-1970s, he established an economically left-wing [[Shlomtzion (political party)|Shlomtzion]] party, which later merged with Likud. On becoming Prime Minister in the 2000s, Sharon twice formed unity governments with the Labor Party.

In 2005 the implementation of the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Gaza disengagement plan]] exposed enormous rifts inside the Likud and wider society in Israel. [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] capitalised on the split within the Likud by aligning himself with the rejectionist faction. While Sharon's popularity grew among the Israeli populace at large, it declined inside the Likud party structure. Netanyahu resigned as [[Finance Minister of Israel|Finance Minister]] on 7 August 2005, saying the government's implementation of the disengagement plan endangered the safety of Israeli citizens. Sharon was then unable to get approval from the Likud Central Committee for his key ally [[Ehud Olmert]] to that position.

The final straw was the unexpected ousting of Sharon's ally [[Shimon Peres]] as leader of the Labor Party by the election of left-wing [[Histadrut]] union leader [[Amir Peretz]] in an internal ballot on 8 November 2005. Peretz demanded that all Labor Party ministers resign from the unity government and called for dissolution of the Knesset and for early elections, which were to be [[Israeli legislative elections, 2006|held in March 2006]]. When all the Labor ministers had resigned, Sharon lost his safety net of supporters from the party for the implementation of his political agenda, which included continuing negotiations with the [[Palestinian Authority]] for "permanent borders" and a hoped-for final resolution of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and the settlement of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Foundation===
[[File:Kadima Israel logo (2005).gif|thumb|"Kadima Israel", original logo from 2005]]
The party was founded by Sharon after he formally left [[Likud]] on 21 November 2005 to establish a new party that would grant him the freedom to carry out the disengagement plan—removing [[Israeli settlement]]s from Palestinian territory and fixing Israel's borders with a prospective Palestinian state.

The name ''Kadima'' (literally: "Forward") emerged within the first days of the split and was favored by Sharon. However, it was not immediately adopted, and the party was initially named "National Responsibility" (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|אחריות לאומית}}, ''Ahrayaut Leumit''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/National-Responsibility-name-of-PMs-new-party-NRP-to-protest |title='National Responsibility' name of PM's new party; NRP to protest |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=21 November 2005 |first=Gil |last=Hoffman |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was proposed by [[Justice Minister of Israel|Justice Minister]] [[Tzipi Livni]] and enthusiastically endorsed by [[Reuven Adler]], Sharon's close confidante and strategy adviser. Although "National Responsibility" was regarded as provisional, subsequent tests conducted with focus groups proved it much more popular than ''Kadima''. "National Responsibility" seemed certain to become permanent. Surprisingly, however, it was announced on 24 November 2005 that the party had finally registered under the name ''Kadima''. The title ''Kadima'' has symbolic meaning for many Israelis who associate it with the battle-charge of army officers; Sharon may have attempted to highlight his military accomplishments ahead of the March 2006 elections. As a common Hebrew word, however, the term ''Kadima'' has been ubiquitous in Israeli political rhetoric and is likely not indicative of any specific ideological bias; indeed, it had been used as a name before by early Zionist leader [[Nathan Birnbaum]], and was the motto of the [[Jewish Legion]] of [[World War I]] formed by [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] and [[Joseph Trumpeldor]]. The decision to name the party "Kadima" was criticised by [[Shinui]] leader [[Yosef Lapid]], who remarked that it was too similar to [[Benito Mussolini]]'s newspaper ''Avanti'' (Italian for "Forward").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gil Hoffman |author2=Tovah Lazaroff |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Shinui-headed-for-oblivion |title=Shinui headed for oblivion |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=25 November 2005 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shimon Peres by David Shankbone.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Shimon Peres]], former leader of the Labor Party, formally joined Kadima and before being elected [[President of Israel]] was in the second place in the Kadima Knesset list after the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and before the Foreign and Justice Minister, Tzipi Livni.]]
According to Sharon supporters, on the first day after its founding, Kadima already had nearly 150 members, most of whom were defectors from Likud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Krusch |date=November 22, 2005 |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Politics/sharonnewparty.html |title=Ariel Sharon Forms New Political Party |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202050100/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Politics/sharonnewparty.html |archivedate=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Knesset members from Labor, Likud, and other parties immediately joined the new party, including [[Cabinet of Israel|cabinet ministers]] [[Ehud Olmert]], [[Tzipi Livni]], [[Meir Sheetrit]], [[Gideon Ezra]] and [[Avraham Hirschson]]. Deputy ministers [[Ruhama Avraham]], [[Majalli Wahabi]], [[Eli Aflalo]], [[Marina Solodkin]], [[Ze'ev Boim]] and [[Yaakov Edri]] also joined the party, along with Likud MKs [[Roni Bar-On]] and [[Omri Sharon]]. Former [[Histadrut]] chairman [[Haim Ramon]] of Labor decided to join the party shortly thereafter. On 30 November 2005, former Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]] left the Labor Party after more than 60 years with the party, and announced he would join Kadima to help Sharon pursue peace with the Palestinians. In the immediate aftermath of [[illnesses of Ariel Sharon|Sharon's illnesses]], there was speculation that Peres might be chosen to take over as leader of Kadima. One poll suggested the party would win 42 seats in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|March 2006 elections]] with Peres as leader compared to 40 if it were led by Ehud Olmert. Most senior Kadima leaders, however, were former members of Likud and indicated their support for (former Likud) Olmert as Sharon's successor.

===Doubts following Sharon's medical problems===
The ramifications of Sharon's close identification with Kadima moved the party in an unexpected direction due to his mounting medical problems, which began only a few weeks after Kadima was formed. First, Sharon was hospitalized on 18 December 2005 after reportedly suffering a minor stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4540550.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Israel's Sharon suffers a stroke | date=18 December 2005 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This introduced a serious element of uncertainty for Sharon's and Kadima's supporters.

During his hospital stay, Sharon was also diagnosed with a minor hole in his [[heart]] and was scheduled to undergo a [[cardiac catheterization]] to fill the hole in his [[atrial septum]] on 5 January 2006. However, on 4 January 2006, 22:50 Israel Time (GMT +0200) Sharon suffered a massive [[hemorrhagic stroke]], and was evacuated to [[Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital]] in Jerusalem to undergo brain surgery.

Acting Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] succeeded him as Prime Ministerial candidate. Without Sharon, there was uncertainty about the future of the party. Nevertheless, three polls taken shortly after Sharon's illness showed that Kadima continued to lead its rivals by large margins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/10481 |title=Israel's Kadima could win under Olmert |publisher=Angus Reid |date=9 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218093920/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/10481 |archivedate=18 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later polls showed Kadima strengthening its power base further, particularly amongst left wing voters who had opposed Sharon in the past.

===In government===
On 16 January 2006, party members chose Ehud Olmert as acting chairman for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|March elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4616644.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Comatose Sharon 'moves eyelids' | date=16 January 2006 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadima won 29 seats, and was asked to form a government by [[President of Israel|president]] [[Moshe Katsav]]. Olmert formed a coalition with Labor, Shas and [[Gil (political party)|Gil]], the government being sworn in on 4 May. 

[[Yisrael Beiteinu]] joined the coalition in October 2006, but left again in January 2008 in protest at negotiations with the Palestinian Authority.

===In opposition===
Olmert resigned as party leader in 2008, resulting in a [[Kadima leadership election, 2008|leadership election]], held on 17 September. The vote was won by [[Tzipi Livni]], who beat [[Shaul Mofaz]], [[Meir Sheetrit]] and [[Avi Dichter]]. Following her victory, Livni failed to form a coalition government, as she refused to agree to Shas' demands, resulting in [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|early elections]] in February 2009. In the elections Kadima remained the largest party in the Knesset, winning 28 seats, one more than Likud. However, Likud's Netanyahu was asked to form a government by President Peres following talks with delegations from all parties represented in the Knesset.

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 legislative election]], Kadima lost almost 90% of its vote share from 2009. The party narrowly avoided being ejected from the Knesset, crossing the 2% threshold by just a few hundred votes. The party was reduced to just two MKs, Mofaz and [[Yisrael Hasson]], making it the smallest of the 12 factions in the chamber. Prior to the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 elections]] Mofaz announced that he was retiring from politics after Kadima decided against joining the [[Zionist Union]] alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-election-2015/1.639266 |title=Israel election updates / Likud: Livni wrong on Congress' Iran sanctions |newspaper=Haaretz, 27 January 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasson had already left the Knesset in 2013 to become chairman of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]].

Following Mofaz's retirement, [[Akram Hasson]] was elected party leader, becoming the first Druze leader of a predominantly Jewish party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Elad Benari |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/190589 |title=Mofaz Resigns from Politics |publisher=Arutz Sheva  |date=28 January 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his leadership was short-lived, with Hasson soon quitting the party to join the [[Kulanu]] list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Elad Benari |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/190743 |title=Mofaz: My Biggest Mistake Was Joining Netanyahu's Coalition |publisher=Arutz Sheva |date=1 February 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving the 12th slot. Following this announcement, Kadima opted to sit out the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bechirot20.gov.il/election/Candidates/Pages/default.aspx |script-title=he:רשימות המועמדים לכנסת |language=he |trans-title=Lists of candidates for the Knesset |work=Knesset Central Elections Committee |date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platform==
*The Israeli nation has a national and historic right to the whole of Israel. However, in order to maintain a Jewish majority, part of the [[Land of Israel]] must be given up to maintain a Jewish and democratic state.
*Israel shall remain a Jewish state and homeland. Jewish majority in Israel will be preserved by territorial concessions to [[Palestinians]].
*[[Jerusalem]] and large settlement blocs in the [[West Bank]] will be kept under Israeli control.
*The Israeli national agenda to end the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and achieve two states for two nations will be the [[road map for peace|road map]]. It will be carried out in stages: dismantling terror organizations, collecting firearms, implementing security reforms in the [[Palestinian Authority]], and preventing incitement. At the end of the process, a demilitarized Palestinian state devoid of [[terrorism|terror]] will be established.
*Israel's political system will be modified to ensure stability. One possibility to achieve this goal would be to hold primary, regional and personal elections to the [[Knesset]] and the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]]'s office.
*Kadima would not rule out a future coalition partnership with any Israeli political party or person.
*promoting equality for minorities
*[[negative income tax]] and national pension
*increasing social security benefits and national health insurance
*civil marriage for same-sex couples
*reform of police

===Political objectives and policies===
In the early stages, the policies of Kadima directly reflected the views of [[Ariel Sharon]] and his stated policies.

Early statements from the Sharon camp reported by the Israeli media claimed that they were setting up a truly "centrist" and "liberal" party. It would appear that Sharon hoped to attract members of the [[Knesset]] from other parties and well-known politicians regardless of their prior beliefs provided they accepted Sharon's leadership and were willing to implement a "moderate" political agenda.

On the domestic front, Sharon had shown a tendency to agree with his past political partner, the pro-secular and outspokenly anti-religious [[Shinui]] party (his allies in the 2003 government), which sought to promote a secular civil agenda as opposed to the strong influence of Israel's [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] parties. One of the Haredi parties, [[United Torah Judaism]], joined Sharon's last coalition at the same time as the Labor Party, after Shinui had left Sharon's original governing coalition. In the past, Shinui had also called itself a "centrist" party because it rejected both Labor's socialism (its economic policies were [[free market|free-market]]) and the Likud's opposition to a Palestinian state (however, from an international standpoint, Shinui may have actually been on the centre-right).

Justice Minister [[Tzipi Livni]] reportedly told [[Israel Army Radio]] that Kadima intended to help foster the desire for a separate [[Palestinian state]], a move applauded by [[leftist]] [[Yossi Beilin]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Sharon was one of the prime architects pushing for the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] that has been criticized by left-wing and right-wing Israeli politicians, but was a cornerstone of Sharon's determination to establish Israel's final borders, which he saw himself as uniquely suited to do in the so-called "Final Status" negotiations.

In a 22 November 2005 press conference, Sharon also mentioned that he favored withdrawing from untenable Israeli settlements in the [[West Bank]], although he declined to give an actual timeline or specifics for the proposed action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nissan Ratzlav-Katz |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/93456 |title=PM Sharon: We Are Committed to the Road Map |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]] |date=22 November 2005 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadima favors continuing a [[market economy|market-based economy]] with adequate [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelvotes.com/downloads/Short_Platforms_Download_Reg.pdf |title=Political Party Platforms |publisher=Israelvotes.com |format=PDF |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4813056.stm |title=Israeli political parties |publisher=BBC News |date=5 April 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Place in the political spectrum===
There has been some debate over where Kadima lies on the political spectrum. Many in the Western media use the term [[centrism|centrist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4585686.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Can Kadima survive without Sharon? | date=5 January 2006 | first=Jonathan | last=Marcus |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/03/28/israel.election/index.html | publisher=CNN | title=Israeli media: Kadima wins at polls |date=28 March 2006 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Joshua Mitnick |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0328/p01s04-wome.html |title=New worldview shapes vote in Israel |newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor |date=28 March 2006 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/05/AR2006010502368.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Scott | last=Wilson | title=Centrist Cause in Israel Seeks New Leader | date=6 January 2006 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in that it is positioned between the Labor Party and Likud). Over the last thirty years, Israel has seen a movement by both the right and the left towards the center. Founder Ariel Sharon spent a career switching between the right of Israeli politics and the left—notably in the 1970s when he served as an aide to then Prime Minister Rabin. Most of its elected membership are former Likud party members, but it also has a number of notable ex-Labor MK's. The previous government of Ehud Olmert was considered left of center, collaborating with the Labor and two sector-socialist parties, Gil and Shas. Following the 2009 elections, with its subsequent political negotiations for a centerist coalition with the Likud and the Labor, it is suggested that the ideological differences of the center-left and center-right in Israel are fairly minor, but the fact that this only lasted 60 days belies this.

When Kadima was trying to form a coalition in 2006, the [[BBC]] reported that the new party leaned center-right in economic terms while its main coalition partner, Labor, leaned center-left. Labor wanted the Finance Ministry to push through some costly social reforms. It failed to get it, but still insists that the minimum wage, and pension and health benefits, be raised in Israel. At the time, Labor favored a negotiated land agreement with [[Palestinian Authority]] President [[Mahmoud Abbas]], and Kadima had so far refused to speak to any Palestinian leader since the Hamas election and has spoken openly of taking unilateral steps in the West Bank, which the Palestinians oppose. Since then, however, Kadima has directly negotiated with the Palestinian Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4966602.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Analysis: Israel's new coalition | date=3 May 2006 | first=Katya | last=Adler |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 elections]], Kadima led the opposition in the Knesset. During the elections, Kadima successfully attracted left-of-center voters, to the dismay of Labor and [[Meretz]] leaders, who discouraged their supporters from doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/2.222/elections-2009-kadima-center-left-voters-will-pick-us-to-ensure-likud-defeat-1.269699 |title=Elections 2009 / Kadima: Center-left voters will pick us to ensure Likud defeat |author=Mazal Mualem |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/2.222/new-movement-meretz-poll-shows-it-losing-undecided-women-s-votes-to-livni-1.269347 |title= New Movement-Meretz polls shows it losing undicided women's vote to Livni |author=Roni Singer-Heruti|work=Haaretz|date=2009-02-04 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Labor nor Meretz, who were initially expected to be Kadima's natural allies, recommended Livni as prime minister to Peres, reportedly due to Livni's courting of [[Avigdor Lieberman]]'s [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/lieberman-not-expected-to-recommend-either-pm-candidate-1.270411 |date=18 February 2009 |title=Lieberman not expected to recommend either PM candidate |author=Mazal Mualem |author2=Yuval Azoulay |author3=Yair Ettinger |author4=Jack Khoury |work=Haaretz |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Yair Ettinger |author2=Lily Galili |author3=Yossi Verter |author4=Mazal Mualem |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/likud-may-offer-top-spots-to-kadima-lieberman-in-bid-to-form-quick-coalition-1.269995 |title=Likud may offer top spots to Kadima, Lieberman in bid to form quick coalition |newspaper=Haaretz |date=12 February 2009 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shimon Peres]] told [[Ynet]] in 2006 that "there is no difference" between Kadima and Labor, and suggested that the two groups unite. He added that neither he nor Kadima founder Ariel Sharon liked the economic policy of Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Attila Somfalvi |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3247300,00.html |title=Peres: Kadima, Labor should unite |publisher=Ynetnews |date=5 April 2006 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Haaretz'' diplomatic correspondent [[Aluf Benn]] suggested in November 2009, that Kadima does not have any ideological differences with the Labor Party that would prevent a merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/opinion-for-the-sake-of-peace-labor-and-kadima-must-merge-1.269893 |title=For the sake of peace, Labor and Kadima must merge |author=Aluf Benn |work=Haaretz |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Shaul Mofaz]] (2012–2015)

In addition, [[Shimon Peres]], a former head of [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor]], served as Deputy Leader, and was elected [[President of Israel|President]] as the Kadima candidate.

The '''Kennan Institute''' of the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] was founded in 1974 to carry out studies of the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Sovietology]]), and subsequently of post-Soviet [[Russia]] and other [[post-Soviet states]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/kennan Kennan Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is widely regarded as the foremost institute for advanced Russia studies in the United States.

The Kennan Institute is the oldest program at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] and a national resource for putting "knowledge in the public service." For over 40 years, the Kennan Institute's mission has been to improve American understanding of Russia in order to improve our nation's ability to engage with and make policy concerning Russia and the wider region.

The Institute is named after [[George Kennan (explorer)|George Kennan]] an American explorer of Russia and twice removed older cousin of Ambassador [[George F. Kennan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clintonpresidentialcenter.org/legacy/101995-remarks-by-the-vp-to-the-kennan-institute-us-russia-council.htm "Remarks by the VP to the Kennan Institute US Russia Council"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George F. Kennan]] is best known as the author of [[The Long Telegram]] and the [[X Article]], and by extension the author of America’s [[containment]] policy toward the Soviet Union. Ambassador Kennan, together with Wilson Center Director [[James H. Billington|James Billington]] and historian [[S. Frederick Starr]], initiated the establishment of the Kennan Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

In addition to its office in Washington, the Kennan Institute operates an office in [[Kiev|Kyiv, Ukraine]]. Kennan’s Kyiv office provides on-the-ground assistance to the Washington staff and a communication link with various Ukrainian organizations. The office also organizes publications, seminars, and conferences on major events of the day featuring Kennan Institute alumni.

==Activities==
The Institute offers residential scholarships in the humanities and social sciences to academic scholars and specialists from government, the media, and the private sectors. Thanks to its location in Washington, D.C., scholars at the Kennan Institute have access to libraries, archives, research facilities, and human resources that are among the finest in the world.

The Institute also administers an active program of public lectures and conferences featuring scholars and public figures from the United States, Ukraine, Russia, and other states from the region. The Institute makes the results of its activities known through a variety of publications including Meeting Reports, Occasional Papers, Special Reports, and commercially published books.

===Research areas===

Most recent research topics include

* Religion in Post-Soviet Societies
* Migration in the Post-Soviet space

==Cooperation==
The Kennan Institute is a partner of the [[Russian and Eurasian Security Specialized Network]] (RES) of the international [[Center for Security Studies (CSS)]], [[ETH Zurich]], [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/net/prin/kennan_institute.cfm International Relations and Security Network ISN - Kennan Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kennan Institute has recently concluded its cooperation with the ISE Center (Information. Scholarship. Education.), [[Moscow]], in administering the Centers for Advanced Study and Education (CASE) program. The CASE program, launched with support from Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, established nine thematic research centers at regional Russian universities in order to foster scholarship in the social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1424&amp;fuseaction=topics.intro About the Kennan Institute], Wilson Center webpage&lt;/ref&gt; These Centers are now administered directly by their home universities and the Russian Ministry of Education.

The '''Khmer People's National Liberation Front''' (KPNLF) was a political front organized in 1979 in opposition to the [[Vietnam]]ese-installed [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (PRK) regime in [[Cambodia]]. The 200,000 Vietnamese troops supporting the PRK, as well as [[Khmer Rouge]] defectors, had ousted the brutal [[Democratic Kampuchea]] regime of [[Pol Pot]], and were initially welcomed by the majority of Cambodians as liberators. Some Khmer, though, recalled the two countries' historical rivalry and feared that the Vietnamese would attempt to subjugate the country, and began to oppose their military presence. Members of the KPNLF supported this view.

==Origins==
On 5 January 1979 a "Committee for a Neutral and Peaceful Cambodia" (''Comité pour un Cambodge Neutre et Indépendant, CCNI'') was established in Paris composed of [[Son Sann]] (a leading Cambodian neutralist, ex-President of the [[National Bank of Cambodia]], and Prime Minister from 1967 to 1968), Sim Var, Yem Sambaur, Hhiek Tioulong, Nong Kimmy, Thonn Ouk and Chai Thoul. It issued a six-point declaration condemning the Khmer Rouge and the "North Vietnamese Aggression", urged adherence to the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva Accords]] and 1973 [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris Peace Conference]] proposals, demanded an immediate ceasefire in Cambodia, and the establishment of a democratically elected government to be established following a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Corfield J. J., "A History of the Cambodian Non-Communist Resistance, 1975-1983." Clayton, Vic., Australia: Centre of Southeast Asian Studies, Monash University, 1991, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Bultmann (2015) 'Inside Cambodian Insurgency. A Sociological Perspective on Civil Wars and Conflict', Ashgate: Burlington, VT/Farnham, UK, {{ISBN|9781472443076}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnam had invaded Democratic Kampuchea in December 1978 and entered [[Phnom Penh]] on January 6, 1979. Immediately the [[Royal Thai Government]] approached Son Sann with offers of support for a non-communist resistance force. Son Sann, in turn, flew to [[New York City]] to ask Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] (who was preparing to address the [[UN General Assembly]]) to lead the KPNLF, but Sihanouk declined and even refused his support.&lt;ref name="Corfield_10"&gt;Corfield J. J., "A History of the Cambodian Non-Communist Resistance, 1975-1983." Clayton, Vic., Australia: Centre of Southeast Asian Studies, Monash University, 1991, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1979, General [[Dien Del]] and Nguon Pythoureth flew to Thailand to form the [[Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces]] (KPNLAF). The two went from camp to camp persuading local leaders to join. Those who agreed to fight under Son Sann were Chea Chhut (at [[Nong Chan Refugee Camp|Nong Chan]]), ex-[[Khmer National Armed Forces]] Colonel Prum Vith, Ta Maing and Om Luot (at [[Nong Samet Refugee Camp|Nong Samet]]). By mid-1979 there were 1600 armed soldiers in the KPNLAF.&lt;ref name="Corfield_10"/&gt;

In August 1979 Son Sann went to [[Thailand]] with his sons (Son Soubert and Son Monir), Neang Chin Han (former Director of the Executive Cabinet under President [[Lon Nol]]), Madame Suon Kaset Sokhomaly, Colonel Thou Thip, Colonel Ea Chuor Kim Meng, Suon Sophat and Buon Say, all from [[France]]. The KPNLF was proclaimed on October 9 at [http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/camps/Site-K-Sok-San.html Sok Sann], a camp in the jungles of the [[Cardamom Mountains]] that contained "barely 2000 men&lt;ref&gt;Bekaert, J., "Kampuchea: The Year of the Nationalists?" Southeast Asian Affairs, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore (1983), pp. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;" and was a merger of 13 quite disparate groups such as the Khleang Moeung (500 men), Cobra (led by Colonel Prum Vith) and Khmer Islam Movement, the Prey Veng, the Nationalist Movement, Oknha Son Kuy, Kauv Tjlok, the Khmer Neutralist Movement, the Black Indra, United Free Khmer, ASW, Tonle Bassak, and the [[Kampong Thom City|Kompong Thom]] Movement.&lt;ref name="Corfield_10"/&gt;  The following month the first shipment of 3000 rifles arrived from [[Beijing]]. Son Sann assumed the leadership of the KPNLF together with an executive committee and a military council.&lt;ref&gt;Corfield J. J., "A History of the Cambodian Non-Communist Resistance, 1975-1983." Clayton, Vic., Australia: Centre of Southeast Asian Studies, Monash University, 1991, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The KPNLF was thus established as a right-wing, pro-Western, anti-Communist political faction in opposition to the Vietnamese-installed and backed People's Republic of Kampuchea.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"The Khmer People's National Liberation Front," Country Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] authorized the provision of aid to KPNLF in an effort to force an end to the Vietnamese occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldandi.com/specialreport/1988/february/Sa13957.htm "Cambodia at a Crossroads", by Michael Johns, ''The World and I'' magazine, February 1988.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the U.S. government initiated a covert aid program to the non-communist resistance (NCR) amounting to $5 million per year, ostensibly for non-lethal aid only. This amount was increased to $8 million in 1984 and $12 million in 1987 and 1988. In late 1988, the United States pared back [[CIA]] funding to $8 million, following reports that $3.5 million had been diverted by the Thai military. At the same time, the Reagan Administration gave new flexibility to the funds, permitting the NCR to purchase US-made weapons in [[Singapore]] and other regional markets. In 1985, the United States established a separate, overt aid program to the non-communist resistance which came to be known as the Solarz Fund after one of its chief sponsors, Rep. [[Stephen Solarz]]. The overt aid program channeled about $5 million per year of [[humanitarian aid]] to the non-communist resistance through [[USAID]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/documents/Refugee-Warriors-on-the-Thai-Cambodian-Border.pdf REFUGEE WARRIORS AT THE THAI-CAMBODIAN BORDER by Cortland Robinson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135121/http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/documents/Refugee-Warriors-on-the-Thai-Cambodian-Border.pdf |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political force prior to the Paris Peace Accords==
Since its beginning, the KPNLF had depended on international financial aid to help maintain their civilian camps and carry out military operations. Sann was critical for gathering this financial aid, as well as increasing international awareness of KPNLF's cause. In fact, in 1982 he went on a fundraising trip to the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. Sann was very popular with his quiet, humble demeanor and engaging personality.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Becker, "The Quiet Cambodian," The New Republic 186, no. 2 (2000): 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Sann's trips, the KPNLF trumpeted their status as the first non-communist anti-PRK faction inside of Cambodia. This increased financial aid because it appealed to the "Western" forces that were interested in ousting the Vietnamese yet not supporting the Khmer Rouge. 
	
In order to increase their political clout and legitimacy, the KPNLF joined with the Khmer Rouge (at this point in time officially called the Party of Democratic Kampuchea) and Prince Sihanouk's United National Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Co-operative Cambodia ([[FUNCINPEC]]) to form the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]] (CGDK). Even though both the KPNLF and FUNCINPEC did not agree with the Khmer Rouge's philosophy and methodology, they still joined the CGDK for the increased international legitimacy and recognition. This increase came because it appeared as if native Cambodians were putting aside their differences and banding together to remove a foreign occupier. In fact, some believe that this coalition was formed in part due to external pressures because the CGDK was allowed to occupy the Cambodian seat in the [[UN]], even though the coalition lacked the normal prerequisites for such recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Findlay, Cambodia The Legacy and Lessons of UNTAC, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military force==
{{main|Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces}}
The military branch of the KPNLF was the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF). Established originally in March 1979 by General [[Dien Del]], it was commanded by [[Sak Sutsakhan]] from 1981-1992 (with the exception of some power struggles).&lt;ref name="Tasker_22_23"&gt;Rodney Tasker,, "Up Against the Odds" Far Eastern Economic Review 131, no.3 (1986):22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in an individual unit the commander was relatively autonomous, therefore General Sak had the difficult job of coordinating the actions of each unit. This understandably led to a lot of confusion and relative ineffectiveness for large-scale battles. On the other hand, this organization reaped benefits in the form of greater flexibility and mobility of the armed forces.

Despite this military tendency to act in the form of individual unit attacks,  occasionally the KPNLAF would join with other separatist forces to launch a large-scale assault on a specific target or area. For example, on March 28, 1986 the CGDK launched a successful raid on [[Battambang]], Cambodia's second largest city.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Tasker, "The Reality of Coalition," Far Eastern Economic Review 133, no.28 (1986): 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the KPNLAF large-scale military actions were stopped after the [[Vietnamese border raids in Thailand|Vietnamese dry season offensive]] in 1984-1985. These attacks were devastating, yet not completely debilitating. Even after the huge loss of approximately 30% of its men and material, the KPNLAF was still able to carry out [[guerrilla]] operations for the rest of its existence.

==Infighting before the Paris Peace Accords==
As with many political groups, the KPNLF had its fair share of party infighting. During its history, two major divides have occurred: one before the Paris Peace Accords in 1991 and one after the UN-backed elections of 1993.

Public knowledge of the first divide began in late December 1985. On one side was Son Sann, president of the faction. On the other side were the usurpers led by military commander Sak Sutsakhan, his chief of staff Dien Del, and party members Abdul Gaffar Peang Meth and Hing Kunthorn. The dissenters' charges against Sann included an unwillingness to attack the Vietnamese in coordination with Sihanouk's forces and supposed meddling in military affairs, both of which led to greater military impotence. They also accused Sann of being undemocratic and "ruling with an iron fist."&lt;ref name="Tasker_22_23"/&gt;

On Jan. 2 the dissidents released a statement saying that they had control of the faction. Dien Del and Sutsakhan had formed the Provisional Central Committee of Salvation whose function was to command the party. Sann then released a counter-statement saying the actions of Dien and Sutsakhan were both illegal and against the spirit of the party, but that they would still be welcomed back to the party if they stopped this divisive action. On the other hand, for Abdul Gaffar Peang Meth and Hing Kunthorn, Sann believed that disciplinary action was necessary in order to rejoin the party. Sann continued on and said he had the support of the [[United States]], [[ASEAN]], and [[China]] (the three major financial backers of the KPNLF).

However, the infighting continued because neither side had the power to defeat the other. As the months wore on, Thai authorities became concerned with the KPNLF and in particular, the KPNLAF's abilities to wage war against the PRK because of divided leadership. Therefore, the Thais helped establish (in March 1986) a 10-member provisional military committee without the knowledge of Sutsakhan or Sann. The committee's purpose was to command the military operations of the KPNLAF until the conflict was over. Members of the committee included Dien Del from the Sutsakhan camp and the new head of Sann's Command committee, Prum Vith.&lt;ref name="Tasker_22_23"/&gt;

The dissidence was finally resolved with the help of a third party. While Sann was allowed to keep the title of the presidency and many of the civilian powers that go with it, Sutsakhan retained his military command of both the faction and joint operations between the KPNLAF and [[FUNCINPEC]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  However, the peace did not last forever, and after the Paris Peace Accords were implemented Sutsakhan formed the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Cambodia)|Liberal Democratic Party]], an offshoot political branch of the KPNLF.&lt;ref&gt;Findlay, Cambodia The Legacy and Lessons of UNTAC, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after the Paris Peace Accords==
In 1991, France and [[Indonesia]] called for a peace conference about the civil war in Cambodia. All four factions inside of Cambodia attended, as well as the UN and many prominent foreign nations (e.g., United States, the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]], and the [[United Kingdom]]). The goal of the conference was to establish a united, peaceful, and neutral democracy in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;From Paris Peace Agreement, October 23, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 1991, all attending parties signed the Paris Peace Agreement. 	

The agreement called for UN sanctioned elections in 1993 to determine the future government of Cambodia. During the time span in between the signing of the peace agreement and the election, Cambodia would be watched over by the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC). The peace agreement stipulated that all four factions must cooperate with UNTAC to slowly disarm their fighting forces. All of the factions did so except for the Khmer Rouge, who then protested and did not partake in the election.

The necessity to change from a military faction to a political party facilitated a name change. The Khmer People's National Liberation Front became the [[Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party]]. The name change did not result from a deviation in the platform or structure of the KPNLF, with the exception of the loss of the KPNLAF and the previously mentioned Sutsakhan breakaway party. The BLDP was still led by Son Sann, and in the UN sanctioned elections of 1993 the BLDP won 10 out of 120 seats in the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Findlay, Cambodia The Legacy and Lessons of UNTAC, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the inability of any one party to win an absolute majority, the BLDP became a junior member of a coalition government with the [[Cambodian People's Party]] (formerly the PRK) and FUNCINPEC. Being a part of the coalition entitled the party to a position in the power-sharing cabinet and an important chair on a commission for the National Assembly (e.g., [[Ieng Mouly]] was the Minister of Information, and Kem Sokha was chairman on the National Assembly's Human Rights Commission.)&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Matthew Lee, "Divided we Fall," Far Eastern Economic Review 158, no.30 (1995): 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infighting after the Paris Peace Accords and the dismantling of the BLDP==
As in early 1986, there was a dissension among the party ranks in 1995. However, this time it was not a disagreement between military and political control, but a conflict between two politicians: Son Sann and Ieng Mouly.

According to sources, Sann and Mouly had been arguing about different topics for many years. Some of their more vocal disagreements were: Sann being fiercely anti-Vietnamese, Sann's hasty rescinded order to boycott the 1993 UN elections, and Mouly's questioning of the appropriateness of the Cambodian monarchy being involved in the new democracy.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

Despite these differences and so many more not mentioned, Mouly and Sann reached a type of power-sharing agreement after the 1993 elections. In exchange for Sann remaining the head of the party, Mouly would get the party's only cabinet position (minister of information). The two decided on this arrangement because it was better to keep the BLDP together, rather than split and lose the party's legislative power, as well as its position in the power sharing coalition.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

However this arrangement did not last very long, for in 1995 the two sides quarreled. To begin with, Sann constantly supported anti-Vietnamese legislation. This irritated Mouly and his supporters, essentially keeping tension between the two groups from subsiding. The boiling point was finally reached when Sann supporters announced that Mouly had been kicked out of the party. This set off a firestorm and Mouly's side immediately responded in kind, stating the opposite: Sann, instead of Mouly, had been removed from the party.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

As time passed, the latter turned out to be true. On July 9, 1995 Ieng Mouly summoned a special congress of the BLDP in order to select new leadership. Due to the non-attendance of Son Sann and his supporters, Mouly was elected unanimously by the congress.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; However, shortly after the congress, the BLDP dissolved. Mouly went on to become leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and Sann's supporters created the [[Son Sann party]].&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; Neither side has won a seat in the National Assembly since the split.

==Jōmon period==

Magatama first appeared in Japan in the [[Jōmon period|Final Jōmon period]], c. 1000 to 300 BCE, and in this period magatama were made from relatively simple, naturally occurring materials, including [[clay]], [[talc]], [[slate]], [[quartz]], [[gneiss]], [[jadeite]], [[nephrite]], and [[serpentinite]].&lt;ref name="nipponika"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika) (日本大百科全書 (ニッポニカ)) | title = Magatama | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/| accessdate = 2012-03-26 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lack the uniformity of design found in magatama produced in later periods.&lt;ref name="kawade"/&gt; Magatama from the Jōmon period were irregularly shaped, lacked continuity in form from region to region, and have been called "[[Stone Age]] magatama" for this reason.&lt;ref name="kokushi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; Magatama are thought to be an imitation of the teeth of large animals, pierced with a hole, which are found in earlier Jōmon remains.&lt;ref name="dijitaru-magatama"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Dijitaru daijisen| title = Magatama | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/| accessdate = 2012-04-01 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; These resemble magatama, but more recent scholarship indicates that these early Jōmon may have simply had a decorative function, and have no relationship to magatama.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt;  Magatama in the Jōmon period appear to have moved from the purely decorative to having a status and ceremonial function by the end of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Naumann | first = Nelly |authorlink=Nelly Naumann | year = 2000 | title = Japanese prehistory : the material and spiritual culture of the Jōmon period | chapter = From early to middle Jōmon | series = Asien- und Afrika-Studien der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin | volume = 6 | publisher = Harrassowitz | place = Wiesbaden | page = 18 | isbn = 9783447043298 | oclc = 45797690}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "middle Jōmon exchange network" may have existed, whereby magatama were produced in regions where materials for their manufacture were readily plentiful. Jade and talc examples produced in bead-making villages located in present-day [[Itoigawa, Niigata]] have been found at a large number of sites in along the northern coast, central mountains, and [[Kantō region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Barnes | first = Gina Lee | year = 1999 | title = The rise of civilization in East Asia: the archaeology of China, Korea and Japan | edition = 1st paperback | publisher = Thames and Hudson | place = New York, N.Y. | page = 30 | isbn = 9780500279748 | oclc = 43664418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological sites (Jōmon)===

*Examples of magatama from the Jōmon period have been discovered in large numbers at the Kamegaoka site in [[Tsugaru, Aomori|Tsugaru]], [[Aomori Prefecture]]. The Kamegaoka remains are among the largest known Jōmon settlement in Japan, and the magatama, among other decorative objects found, may be an indicator of the high social status of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aikens | first = C.

*Other sites associated with the Kamegaoka settlement have yielded magatama, including the Ōboriya [[midden|shell mound]], in the northwest corner of [[Ōfunato Bay]], which yielded a huge number of beads, as well as the Karekawa site, near [[Hachinohe, Aomori|Hachinohe]], [[Aomori Prefecture]].

*Stone and clay magatama and magatama-like [[bead]]s have also been discovered at the Amataki site, [[Ninohe, Iwate|Ninohe]], [[Iwate Prefecture]], Osagata site, [[Ibaraki Prefecture]], and the Kou site, [[Fujiidera, Osaka|Fujiidera]], [[Osaka Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aikens | first = C.

==Yayoi period==
[[File:Magatama40.JPG|left|thumb|Agate magatama, {{Nihongo|[[Kobe Archaeology Center]]|神戸市埋蔵文化財センター|Kōbeshi Maizō Bunkazai Sentā}}]]

Magatama in the [[Yayoi period]], c.  300 BCE to 300 CE, are notably different from Jōmon-period magatama. The jewels moved from a primitive, non-standard form towards more polished and uniform form in this period.&lt;ref name="kawade"/&gt; The technology to cut large gemstones and polish jewels notably advanced in the Yayoi period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Saitō | first = Tadashi | year = 1958 | title = Genshi (原始) | chapter = Seikatsu yōshiki no hatten (生活様式の発展) | series = Nihon zenshi (日本全史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Tōkyō Daigaku Shuppankai | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 82 | oclc = 35922174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refined materials such as jadeite, serpentinite, and [[glass]] replaced the less sophisticated materials of the Jōmon period.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; Yayoi period magatama are noted for their reverse C-shaped form, which by the end of the period became an almost squared shape.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; From the Yayoi period on magatama uniformly feature a bored hole that allowed the jewels to be held on a string.

The Yayoi period is marked by specific centers specializing in magatama and the widespread trade of magatama. The period is marked by the formation of power centers that came to be individual states. The development of weapons increased in this period to protect increasingly developed rice fields and fishing rights. Trade greatly increased in this period, as did the specialization of production of certain items, including magatama. Magatama producing areas exchanged their product with other products, specifically [[rice]], leading to the widespread distribution of magatama across Japan.&lt;ref name="yomiuri-kuni"&gt;{{Citation | editor = Okada, Akio| year = 1959 | title = Nihon no hajimari (日本のはじまり) | chapter = Kuniguni no matomari (国々のまとまり) | series = Nihon no rekishi (日本の歴史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Yomiuri Shinbunsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 110 | oclc = 33688869|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magatama were commonly used to create necklaces and bracelets worn on the wrists or ankles. The necklace was typically constructed of jadeite magatama separated by cylindrical bored-holed pieces of jasper. Small beads of dark-blue glass are also not uncommon on the necklace. The bracelet was typically also used shells from the coastal areas of Shikoku and the Inland Sea, wood, and bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor = Okada, Akio| year = 1959 | title = Nihon no hajimari (日本のはじまり) | chapter = Kawatte kita shakai seikatsu (変わってきた社会生活) | series = Nihon no rekishi (日本の歴史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Yomiuri Shinbunsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 99 | oclc = 33688869|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period the use of the [[mirror]], [[sword]], and jewels as status symbols for village, and later regional leaders of all kinds, emerged in the Yayoi period, and point to the origin of the mirror, sword, and magatama as the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]].&lt;ref name="yomiuri-1"&gt;{{Citation | editor = Okada, Akio| year = 1959 | title = Nihon no hajimari (日本のはじまり) | series = Nihon no rekishi (日本の歴史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Yomiuri Shinbunsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 122 | oclc = 33688869|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', the earliest historical document with a reference to Japan, describes the [[Wa (Japan)|Wa people]], an ancient country of [[Yamatai]], and its queen, [[Himiko]]. The ''Record'' indicates that when Himiko died her relative Iyo, a girl of thirteen, was made queen and sent a delegation of twenty officials under Yazuku, an imperial general, to offer tribute to the [[Northern Wei]] court. "The delegation visited the capital and [] offered to the court five thousand white gems and two pieces of carved jade, as well as twenty pieces of brocade with variegated designs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tsunoda | first = Ryunosuke| title = Sources of Japanese tradition | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York  | series = Records and civilization, sources and studies | chapter = The earliest records of Japan | pages = 8–16 | year = 1958 | isbn = 0231022549|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carved jade in the ''Record'' likely describes a tribute of two jade magatama.

*The large-scale Yayoi period remains at the [[Yoshinogari site]], [[Yoshinogari, Saga|Yoshinogari]] and [[Kanzaki, Saga|Kanzaki]] in [[Saga Prefecture]] revealed examples of [[lead glass]] magatama typical of the Yayoi period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kidder | first = J.

*In 2003 the excavation of a large Yayoi period settlement in [[Tawaramoto, Nara]], revealed two large jade magatama, one {{Convert|4.64|cm|in}}, the second {{Convert|3.63|cm|in}} in length. The larger Tawaramoto magatama is the 10th largest found to date in Japan. Both jade magatama from the site are of unusually high-quality brilliant green jade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.47news.jp/CN/200309/CN2003091801000474.html 弥生で最大級のひすい製品　唐古・鍵遺跡出土の勾玉]{{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*One known center of Yayoi magatama production was in the area of the [[Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine]] in [[Osaka]]. Tamatsukuri literally means "jewel making" and a [[guild]], the Tamatsukuri-be, was active from the Yayoi period. An existing jewel at the shrine is said to have great spiritual power. Magatama appear on all sorts of implements of the present-day temple, including [[amulet]]s, roof [[tile]]s, and lanterns. The [[Inari Ōkami|inari]] female [[fox]] at the gate of a subshrine of Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine wears a necklace of magatama. The shrine has an exhibit on the history and production of magatama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Smyers | first = Karen Ann | year = 1999 | title = The fox and the jewel: shared and private meanings in contemporary Japanese inari worship | chapter = Introducing Inari | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | place = Honolulu | pages = 23–24 | isbn = 9780824820589 | oclc = 39523475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kofun period==
[[Image:Magatamarm.jpg|thumb|Necklace of jade magatama from a Japanese burial]]
[[Image:Magatamas.JPG|thumb|Magatamas in Kofun period]]

Magatama became very common in the [[Kofun period]], c. CE 250 to CE 538, and by the end of the period almost all [[kofun]] [[tumulus|tumuli]] contained magatama.&lt;ref name="kawade"/&gt; In the early Kofun period magatama were made from jadeite as in earlier periods, but by the middle of the period were made from [[jasper]], and by the end of the period, almost exclusively of [[agate]] and [[jade]].&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; Magatama capped by silver or gold also appear towards the end of the period. Large magatama made of [[talc]], imitations of smaller ones made of more precious materials, were used as [[grave goods]].&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; Magatama are found in [[kofun]] tumuli across Japan from the period. Their use went from merely decorative to sacred and ceremonial grave goods.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yomiuri"&gt;{{Citation | editor = Okada, Akio| year = 1959 | title = Nihon no hajimari (日本のはじまり) | series = Nihon no rekishi (日本の歴史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Yomiuri Shinbunsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 29 | oclc = 33688869|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Nihongo|Chōjigashira magatama|丁字頭勾玉}} are magatama with inscriptions that look like flowers of the [[clove]] tree and have a hole suitable to attach to a string.&lt;ref name="kawade"/&gt; These first appear in the Kofun period.&lt;ref name="kokushi"/&gt; In the Kofun period magatama appear on necklaces, with several magatama set between bored [[cylinder]]s. Archeological remains show evidence of similar ankle bracelets, but they are less common. Clay [[haniwa]] funerary objects of the Kofun period commonly depict people wearing the necklaces and ankle bracelets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Holtom | first = Daniel Clarence | year = 1928 | title = The Japanese enthronement ceremonies; with an account of the imperial regalia | chapter = The jewels | publisher = Kyo Bun Kwan | publication-place = Tokyo | page = 33 | oclc = 1983823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological sites (Kofun)===

Examples of stone magatama from the Kofun period are especially numerous.

*An excavation of the Kamegaoka Kofun, [[Kishiwada, Osaka]], revealed a local who had been buried with a jade, jasper, and alabaster magatama necklace, as well as magatama placed near the feet. A bronze mirror imported from China accompanying the burial is dated to 239 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aikens | first = C.

*Ceremonial offerings from a burial from the Kisami-Araida area of [[Shimoda, Shizuoka]], reveal clay reproductions of magatama used as effigies. The excavation of the Ubusuna Kofun&lt;ref name="kyotango"&gt;[http://www.city.kyotango.kyoto.jp/service/digitalmuseum/siteibunkazai/ubusunayamakofun.html 史跡　産土山古墳]{{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kyōtango]], Kyoto yielded two fully intact magatama necklaces of jade and agate with segments between 1.7 and 5.1&amp;nbsp;cm in length.&lt;ref name="kyotango"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aikens | first = C.

*The large Muro Miyayama Kofun of [[Katsuragi, Nara]], on the Yamato Plain, 238&amp;nbsp;mm in length, was plundered long before its excavation, but revealed 600 talc ceremonial magatama among other funerary objects, which also included 10 bronze Han Chinese mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aikens | first = C.

*The [[Hiraide remains]] of [[Shiojiri, Nagano]], is one of the three largest prehistoric sites in Japan, and was far from any regional power center. The Hiraide site not only includes typical Kofun period remains, but also objects associated with modern Shinto ceremonial practice. Nevertheless, kofun in Hiraide reveal both plain and elaborate magatama among other funerary objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aikens | first = C.

*The Sakurai Kofun in [[Sakurai, Nara]], excavated in 1949, represents a kofun from the final phase of the Kofun period, and is possibly from a ruler associated with the imperial family. The kofun is {{Convert|25|m|ft}} high and shows evidence of being surrounded by a [[moat]]. Among the very large number of funerary objects were high-quality weapons, including swords, 10 mirrors, and a necklace of jadeite magatama, agate cylinders, and glass beads used to make a magatama-style necklace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Inoue | first = Mitsusada | year = 1965 | title = Shinwa kara rekishi he (神話から歴史へ) | chapter = Nazo no seiki (なぞの世紀)　| edition = Shohan | series = 日本の歴史 (Nihon no rekishi) | volume = 1 | publisher = Chūō Kōronsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | pages = 309–310 | oclc = 21390677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of magatama forms ==

Archaeologists and historians are unable yet to explain what the origins of magatama forms are, or whether these forms can be traced back to one convergent source. However, these alternative explanations have been provided:&lt;ref&gt;Nishimura, Y. (2018). The Evolution of Curved Beads (Magatama 勾玉/曲玉) in Jōmon Period Japan and the Development of Individual Ownership. Asian Perspectives 57(1), 105-158. University of Hawai'i Press. Retrieved October 18, 2018, from Project MUSE database.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Magatama may be fashioned after animal fangs/teeth
* Magatama may be modeled after the shape of fetuses
* Magatama could symbolize the shape of the soul
* Magatama may be modeled after the shape of the moon
* That there is meaning and connotation attached to the shape of the magatama itself (i.e. meaning comes from the form itself, and not that magatama has been patterned after anything else)

==In Japanese mythology==

The [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]], completed in the 8th century, have numerous references to magatama.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; They appear in the first chapter of the Nihon Shoki, which largely describes the mythology of Japan. [[Susanoo]], god of the sea and storms, received five hundred magatama from [[Tamanoya no mikoto]], or Ame-no-Futodama-no-mikoto, the jewel-making deity.&lt;ref name="gods"&gt;{{Citation | last = Czaja | first = Michael | year = 1974 | title = Gods of myth and stone: phallicism in Japanese folk religion | chapter = The celestial matsuri | edition = 1st | publisher = Weatherhill | place = New York | page = 228 | isbn = 9780834800953 | oclc = 1085538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susanoo went to heaven and presented them to his sister, the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]], who bit off successive parts of the magatama, and blew them away to create other deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Aston | editor-first = W.

In the legend Amaterasu later shuts herself in a cave. [[Ama-no-Koyane-no-mikoto]] hung magatama, among other objects, on a five hundred-branch [[sakaki]] tree, to successfully lure Amaterasu from the cave.&lt;ref name="gods"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Aston | editor-first = W.

This magatama was presented to Suinin, who enshrined it at Isonokami Shrine, where it is said to presently reside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Aston | editor-first = W.

===Yasakani no Magatama===

A noted magatama is the {{Nihongo|Yasakani no Magatama|八尺瓊勾玉|extra=also {{lang|ja|八尺瓊曲玉}} and {{lang|ja|八坂瓊曲玉}}}}, one of the three [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia-regalia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Japan | title = Imperial regalia | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-04-01 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swords, mirrors, and jewels were common objects of status for regional rulers in Japan as early as the Yayoi period,&lt;ref name="yomiuri-1"/&gt; and were further widespread in the Kofun period, as shown by their ubiquitous presence in kofun tumuli.&lt;ref name="yomiuri"/&gt; The Yasakani no Magatama is stored at the {{Nihongo|Kashiko-dokoro|賢所|}}, the central shrine of the [[Three Palace Sanctuaries]] at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]], and is used in the [[Enthronement of the Japanese Emperor|enthronement ceremony of the Emperor of Japan]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia-regalia"/&gt;

[[D. C. Holtom|Daniel Clarence Holtom]] stated in 1928 in ''Japanese enthronement ceremonies; with an account of the imperial regalia'' that the Yasakani no Magatama is the only one of the three regalia that exists in its original form;&lt;ref name="holtom-1928"&gt;{{Citation | last = Holtom | first = Daniel Clarence | year = 1928 | title = The Japanese enthronement ceremonies; with an account of the imperial regalia | chapter = The jewels | publisher = Kyo Bun Kwan | publication-place = Tokyo | page = 55 | oclc = 1983823}}&lt;/ref&gt; post-[[World War II]] scholarship supports the claim. Replicas of the sword and mirror were made as early as the 9th century, and the originals were entrusted to other shrines.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia-imp"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Japan | title = Kurayoshi Plain | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-04-12 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Ryūkyūan religion==

[[D. C. Holtom]] stated that [[noro (priestess)|noro priestesses]] of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] wore magatama necklaces early in the twentieth century for ceremonial purposes, but provides no other details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Holtom | first = Daniel Clarence | year = 1928 | title = The Japanese enthronement ceremonies; with an account of the imperial regalia | chapter = The jewels | publisher = Kyo Bun Kwan | publication-place = Tokyo | page = 37 | oclc = 1983823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Market value''' or '''OMV''' (Open Market Valuation) is the price at which an asset would trade in a competitive auction setting. Market value is often used interchangeably with ''open market value'', ''[[fair value]]'' or ''[[fair market value]]'', although these terms have distinct definitions in different standards, and may or may not differ in some circumstances.

==Definition==
[[International Valuation Standards]] defines market value as "the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an [[Arm's length principle|arm’s-length]] transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently, and without compulsion".&lt;ref&gt;IVS 1 - Market Value Basis of Valuation, Seventh Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Market value is a concept distinct from [[market price]], which is “the price at which one can transact”, while market value is “the true underlying value” according to theoretical standards. The concept is most commonly invoked in [[Efficient-market hypothesis|inefficient markets]] or [[Economic equilibrium#Disequilibrium|disequilibrium]] situations where prevailing market prices are not reflective of true underlying market value.  For market price to equal market value, the market must be informationally efficient and [[rational expectations]] must prevail.

Recently, Mocciaro Li Destri, Picone &amp; Minà (2012)&lt;ref name ="test"&gt;Mocciaro Li Destri A., Picone P. M. &amp; Minà A. (2012), Bringing Strategy Back into Financial Systems of Performance Measurement: Integrating EVA and PBC, Business System Review, Vol 1., Issue 1. pp.85-102 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2154117.&lt;/ref&gt; have underscored the subtle but important difference between the firms’ capacity to create value through correct operational choices and valid strategies, on the one hand, and the epiphenomenal manifestation of variations in stockholder value on the financial markets (notably on stock markets). In this perspective, they suggest to implement new methodologies able to bring strategy back into financial performance measures.

Market value is also distinct from [[fair value]] in that fair value depends on the parties involved, while market value does not. For example, IVS currently notes fair value "requires the assessment of the price that is fair between two specific parties taking into account the respective advantages or disadvantages that each will gain from the transaction. Although market value may meet these criteria, this is not necessarily always the case. Fair value is frequently used when undertaking due diligence in corporate transactions, where particular synergies between the two parties may mean that the price that is fair between them is higher than the price that might be obtainable in the wider market. In other words "special value" may be generated. Market value requires this element of "special value" to be disregarded, but it forms part of the assessment of fair value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivsc.org/pubs/exp_drafts/ivs2.pdf|title=Exposure Draft of Proposed Revised International Valuation Standard 2 - Bases Other than Market Value, June, 2006|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621040820/http://www.ivsc.org/pubs/exp_drafts/ivs2.pdf|archivedate=21 June 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real estate==
The term is commonly used in [[real estate appraisal]], since real estate markets are generally considered both informationally and transactionally inefficient.  Also, real estate markets are subject to prolonged periods of disequilibrium, such as in contamination situations or other market disruptions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Appraisals are usually performed under some set of assumptions about transactional markets, and those assumptions are captured in the definition of value used for the appraisal. Commonly, the definition set forth for U.S. federally regulated lending institutions is used, although other definitions may also be used under some circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Register'' Vol. 55, No. 163, August 22, 1990.  This definition has also been adopted by the International Association of Assessing Officials for tax assessment purposes.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The most probable price (in terms of money) which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: the buyer and seller are typically motivated; both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their best interests; a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; payment is made in terms of cash in United States dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or [[creative financing]] or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale."

In the USA, Licensed or Certified Apppraisers may be required under state, federal, or local laws to develop appraisals subject to USPAP [[Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice]]. The [[Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice]] requires that when market value is the applicable definition, the appraisal must also contain an analysis of the highest and best use as well as an estimation of exposure time. All states require mandatory licensure of appraisers.

It is important to note that USPAP does not require that all real estate appraisals be performed based on a single definition of market value.  Indeed, there are frequent situations when appraisers are called upon to appraise properties using other value definitions.  If a value other than market value is appropriate, USPAP only requires that the appraiser provide both the definition of value being used and the citation for that definition.

=== Other definitions===
Market value is the most commonly used type of value in real estate appraisal in the United States because it is required for all federally regulated mortgage transactions, and because it has been accepted by US courts as valid.  However, real estate appraisers use many other definitions of value in other situations.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 4th ed. (Chicago:  [[Appraisal Institute]], 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liquidation value====
Liquidation value is the most probable price that a specified interest in real property is likely to bring under all of the following conditions:

# Consummation of a sale will occur within a severely limited future marketing period specified by the client.
# The actual market conditions currently prevailing are those to which the appraise property interest is subject.
# The buyer is acting prudently and knowledgeably.
# The seller is under extreme compulsion to sell.
# The buyer is typically motivated.
# The buyer is acting in what he or she considered his or her best interest.
# A limited marketing effort and time will be allowed for the completion of the sale.
# Payment will be made in cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto.
# The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold, unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.

====Orderly liquidation value====

This value definition differs from the previous one in that it assumes an orderly transition, and not "extreme compulsion".&lt;ref&gt;''Valuing Machinery and Equipment:  The Fundamentals of Appraising Machinery and Technical Assets'', 2nd ed., (American Society of Appraisers, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal land acquisition====

For land acquisitions by or funded by U.S. federal agencies, a slightly different definition applies:&lt;ref&gt;''Uniform Standards for Federal Land Acquisition''&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Fair market value is defined as the amount in cash or terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which in all probability the property would be sold by a knowledgeable owner willing but not obligated to sell to a knowledgeable purchaser who desired but is not obligated to buy.  In ascertaining that figure, consideration should be given to all matters that might be brought forward and reasonably be given substantial weight in bargaining by persons of ordinary prudence, but no consideration whatever should be given to matters not affecting market value."

====Going concern value====
When a real estate appraiser works with a [[business valuation]] appraiser (and perhaps an equipment and machinery appraiser)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appraisers.org/MTSHome/WhatIsMTS.aspx|title=Error404|website=www.appraisers.org|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a value of the combination of a business and the real estate used for that business, the specific market value is called "going concern value". It recognizes that the combined market value may be different from the sum of the separate values: "The market value of all the tangible and intangible assets of an established operating business with an indefinite life, as if sold in aggregate."&lt;ref&gt;''The Appraisal of Real Estate'', 12th ed., (Chicago:  The Appraisal Institute, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use value====
[[Value-in-use|Use value]] takes into account a specific use for the subject property and does not attempt to ascertain the highest and best use of the real estate. For example, the appraisal may focus on the contributory value of the real estate to a business enterprise.

Some property tax jurisdictions allow agricultural use appraisals for farmland. Also, current IRS estate tax regulations allow land under an interim agricultural use to be valued according to its current use regardless of development potential.&lt;ref&gt;Timberland Appraisal [http://www.timbertax.org/getstarted/appraisal/value.asp Timberland Appraisal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic value and Investor confidence==
Stability and [[economic growth]] are two factors that international investors are seeking when considering investment options. A country offering [[economic value]] amongst its other incentives attracts [[Investment|investment funds]].  A political unrest situation can be the cause of not only loss of confidence, but a reduced value in currency, creating transfer of capital to other and more stable sources.

In the event of a government printing currency to discharge a portion of a significant amount of debt, the supply of money is increased, with an ultimate reduction in its value, aggravated by [[inflation]]. Furthermore, should a government be unable to service its deficit by way of selling domestic bonds, thereby increasing the supply of money, it must increase the volume of saleable securities to foreigners, which in turn creates a decrease in their value.

A significant debt can prove a concern for foreign investors, should they believe there is a risk of the country defaulting on its obligations. They will be reluctant to purchase securities subject to that particular currency, if there is a perceived, significant risk of default. It is for this reason that the debt rating of a country; for example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credit Ratings|url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/definitions-and-faqs/en/us|website=Standardandpoors|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as determined by Moody's or [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] is a crucial indicator of its exchange rate.

Currency values and exchange rates play a crucial part in the rate of [[return on investment]]s. Value for an investor, is the exchange rate of the currency which, contains the bulk of a portfolio, determining its real return. A declining value in the exchange rate has the effect of decreasing the purchasing power of income and capital gains, derived from any returns. In addition, other income factors such as interest rates, inflation and even capital gains from domestic securities, are influenced by the influential and complex factors, of the exchange rate.

==Legal Interpretation==
The case of Luxmoore-May and Another v. Messenger May Baverstock [1990] 1 W.L.R. 1009 shows us the legal interpretation of market value: "The measure of damage in this case is, I conclude, the difference between what the foxhounds in fact realised consequent on the defendants' breach of contract and what was their true open market value at that time. What better guide could there be to that value than the price at which these paintings happened to be knocked down at Sotheby's so shortly afterwards? The price which the international art market was willing to pay was surely prima facie the best evidence of the foxhounds' value." Also the equilibrium of the qualibrium is hard to distinguish between.

{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar}}
In [[political science]], '''Marxism–Leninism''' is the ideology combining [[Marxism|Marxist]] socio-economic theory and [[Leninism|Leninist]] political [[Praxis (process)|praxis]], which was the official ideology of the [[Soviet Union]], of the political parties of the [[Communist International]], and of [[Stalinist]] political parties.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Historical Term'' (1998) Second Edition, Chris Cook, Ed., pp. 221–222, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of Marxism–Leninism is the [[Two-stage theory|revolutionary development]] of a [[capitalist state]] into a [[socialist state]], effected by the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of professional revolutionaries from the [[working class]] (the [[proletariat]]). The socialist state is realised by way of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], which determines policy with [[democratic centralism]] (diversity in discussion and unity in action).&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Historical Terms'' (1998) Second Edition, Chris Cook, Ed., pp. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert, Michael; Hahnel, Robin. ''Socialism Today and Tomorrow''. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: South End Press, 1981. pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, Marxism–Leninism establishes the [[communist party]] as the primary social force to organise society as a socialist state, which is the intermediate stage of socio-economic development towards a [[communist society]]—a [[Stateless society|stateless]] and [[classless society]] that features [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]]; accelerated [[industrialisation]] and concentrated development of [[science]] and [[technology]] in support of the [[productive forces]] of society;&lt;ref&gt;Andrain, Charles F. ''Comparative Political Systems: Policy Performance and Social Change''. Armonk, New York, USA: M. E. Sharpe, Inc., 1994. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nationalisation]] of the land and natural resources of the country and public control of societal institutions.&lt;ref name="sioc33"&gt; Todd, Allan. ''History for the IB Diploma: Communism in Crisis: 1976–89'', p. 16. "The term Marxism–Leninism, invented by Stalin, was not used until after Lenin's death in 1924. It soon came to be used in Stalin's Soviet Union to refer to what he described as 'orthodox Marxism'. This increasingly came to mean what Stalin, himself, had to say about political and economic issues. . . . However, many Marxists (even members of the Communist Party, itself) believed that Stalin's ideas and practices (such as socialism in one country and the purges) were almost total distortions of what Marx and Lenin had said".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s, [[Joseph Stalin]] established ideologic orthodoxy in the [[Soviet Union]] and among the Communist International with his definition of the term "Marxism–Leninism", which redefined the theories of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] and political praxis for the exclusive benefit of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, Allan, Trombley, Stephan. Eds. ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (1999) Third Edition, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="made_by_stalin22"&gt;Lisischkin, G. (Г. Лисичкин), ''Novy Mir'' (Мифы и реальность, Новый мир), 1989, № 3, p. 59 {{ru icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, after publication of ''[[The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)]]'' (1938), Stalin's official textbook on the subject, the term Marxism–Leninism became common, political usage among communists and non-communists.&lt;ref&gt;"Marxism" entry in the ''[[Soviet Encyclopedic Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical of the Stalinist model of communism in the Soviet Union, the American Marxist [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] and the Italian Marxist [[Amadeo Bordiga]] dismissed Marxism–Leninism as a type of [[state capitalism]],&lt;ref name="statecap3"&gt;Howard, M.C., King, J.E. [http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf/34-A-08.pdf "State capitalism" in the Soviet Union"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102125929/http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf/34-A-08.pdf |date=2 November 2018 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; stating that (i) Marx had identified [[state ownership]] of the means of production as a form of state capitalism—except under certain socio-economic conditions, which usually do not exist in [[Communist state|Marxist–Leninist state]]s;&lt;ref name="statecap3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenstein, Nelson. "American Capitalism: Social Thought and Political Economy in the Twentieth Century" (2011) University of Pennsylvania Press, pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) that the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat is a form of [[democracy]], therefore the [[single-party rule]] of a vanguard party is undemocratic;&lt;ref&gt;Ishay, Micheline. ''The Human Rights Reader: Major Political Essays, Speeches, and Documents from Ancient Times to the Present'' (2007) Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) that Marxism–Leninism is neither [[Marxism]] nor [[Leninism]], nor a philosophic synthesis, but an artificial term that Stalin used to personally determine what is communism and what is not communism.&lt;ref name="sioc32"&gt;Todd, Allan.

== Background ==
{{Leninism sidebar|expanded=Schools}}
{{further information|State ideology of the Soviet Union}}
Within five years of the death of Lenin, in 1924, [[Joseph Stalin]] was the [[government of the Soviet Union]], and pragmatically abided and flouted the socialist principles of Lenin and Marx as political expediencies to realise his plans plans for Russia and for [[world socialism]].&lt;ref name="stalin_follow_marx_lenin"&gt;Александр Бутенко (Aleksandr Butenko), Социализм сегодня: опыт и новая теория// Журнал Альтернативы, №1, 1996, pp. 2–22 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; To justify his régime, Stalin used the book ''Concerning Questions of Leninism'' (1926), his compilation of Marx and Lenin, which presented Marxism–Leninism as a separate ideology that featured an omniscient leader,&lt;ref name="made_by_stalin22"/&gt; later in his régime, Stalinism (Marxism–Leninism) was the official state [[ideology of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Александр Бутенко (Aleksandr Butenko), Социализм сегодня: опыт и новая теория// Журнал Альтернативы, №1, 1996, pp. 3–4 {{ru icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Stalin's opposition within the communist party and the soviet government, the Trotskyists argued that the Marxist–Leninist ideology of [[Stalinism]] contradicted [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]], and thus was illegitimate socialist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Лев Троцкий ([[Lev Trotsky]]), Сталинская школа фальсификаций, М. 1990, pp. 7–8 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; To differentiate themselves from Stalin, the Trotskyists used the term [[Trotskyism|Bolshevik–Leninism]], Trotsky's ideology of communism. Moreover, in Marxist political discourse the term "Marxism–Leninism" has two usages: (i) praise of Stalin, by Stalinists who believe Stalin successfully developed Lenin's legacy; and (ii) criticism of Stalin, by Stalinists who repudiate Stalin's repressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00045/73200.htm?text=%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC-%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC|script-title=ru:Марксизм-ленинизм|accessdate=18 October 2010|author=М.

Consequent to the [[Sino-Soviet split]] in 1956, the communist party of each country, of the People's Republic of China and of the Soviet Union, claimed to be the sole, ideological heir-and-successor to Marxism–Leninism—and thus ideological leader of [[world communism]].&lt;ref name="World History 2000. p. 769"&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', B.P. Lenman, T. Anderson editors, Chambers: Edinburgh: 2000. p. 769.&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the official [[History of the People's Republic of China]] represents [[Mao Zedong]]'s practical application and adaptation of Marxism–Leninism to Chinese conditions as a fundamental up-dating of Leninism which is applicable worldwide—consequently, [[Maoism]] (the Thought of Mao Zedong) was the official state ideology of the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name="fontana 501"&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition (1999), Allan Bullock and Stephen Trombley, Eds., p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Chinese sphere of geopolitical influence, the [[Sino-Albanian split|Sino–Albanian split]] (1972–1978)—caused by Albanian Communist rejection of the Chinese Communists' ''[[Realpolitik]]'' of Sino–American rapprochement (Mao and [[Richard Nixon]] meeting) as an ideological betrayal of Mao's own [[Three Worlds Theory]]—appeared as a lessening of Mao's commitment to [[proletarian internationalism]]. Among Communists, those contradictions between the orthodoxy of Maoism and Mao's pragmatism usually compelled the Marxist–Leninists to either minimise or repudiate the role of Maoism in China's actions in the [[International Communist Movement]], wherein Mao had favoured the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] and advocated Stalinism, the stricter ideological adherence to the example of Stalin.

As revolutionary praxis, [[Maoism]] is the basic ideology of communist parties politically sympathetic to the [[Communist Party of China]]. Since the death of Mao in 1976, the Maoist [[Shining Path|Communist Party of Peru (Sendero Luminoso)]] coined the term [[Marxism–Leninism–Maoism]] because Maoism is the more modern Marxism, adaptable to local conditions in [[Three-world model|Third-world]] South America.&lt;ref name="fontana 501"/&gt; In 1977, the native Korean ideology of ''[[Juche]]'' (self-reliance) replaced Marxism–Leninism as the official state ideology of the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]]. In contemporary [[List of socialist states|socialist states]], Marxism–Leninism is the official state ideology of the [[Republic of Cuba]], the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]. Marxism–Leninism in the official state ideology of the [[People's Republic of China]] as Maoism.

== Marxist–Leninist state ==
{{Marxism|Variants}}
The [[Marxist–Leninist state]] is a [[one-party state]] wherein the [[communist party]] is the [[Vanguardism|political vanguard]] who guides the [[proletariat]] and the [[working class]]es in establishing the social, economic and cultural foundations of a [[socialist state]], a stage of historical development en route to a [[communist society]].&lt;ref name="Alexander Shtromas 2003. p. 18"&gt;Shtromas, Alexander, Faulkner, Robert K, Mahoney, Daniel J. ''Totalitarianism and the Prospects for World Order: Closing the Door on the Twentieth Century'' (2003). Lexington Books. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the socialist state, government is exercised with the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], which defines, implements and realises policy by way of [[democratic centralism]].&lt;ref name="Albert pp. 24-25"&gt;Albert, Michael and Hahnel, Robin. ''Socialism Today and Tomorrow'' (1981) Boston, Massachusetts, USA: South End Press, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative offices and posts of government are filled with people elected at the local, regional and national levels, usually by direct election;&lt;ref name="Pons p. 306"&gt;Pons, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; however, indirect election also features in the Marxist–Leninist praxis of the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Cuba and the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (1943–1992).&lt;ref name="Pons p. 306"/&gt;

=== Economic ===
The goal of Marxist–Leninist [[political economy]] is the emancipation of men and women from the [[dehumanisation]] caused by mechanistic work that is [[Theory of alienation|psychologically alienating]] (without work–life balance) in exchange for [[wage]]s, namely the limited financial-access to the material necessities of life (i.e. food and shelter). That emancipation from poverty (material necessity) would maximise individual liberty by enabling men and women to pursue their interests and innate talents ([[Art|artistic]], [[Intellectualism|intellectual]], industrial, etc.) whilst working by choice without the economic coercion of [[poverty]]. In the [[communist society]] of upper-stage economic development, the elimination of alienating labour (mechanistic work) depends upon [[High technology|technological advances]] that improve the means of production and distribution.

To meet the material needs of society, the Marxist–Leninist state uses a [[planned economy]] to co-ordinate the [[means of production]] and of distribution to supply the goods and services required throughout society and the national economy;&lt;ref&gt;Pons, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; and the worker's wages are determined according to the type of skills and the type of work he or she can perform within the national economy.&lt;ref&gt;Pons, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the economic value of the goods and services produced is based upon their [[use value]] (as material objects) and not upon the [[Labor theory of value|cost of production]] or the [[Marginal Utility|exchange value]].&lt;ref name="Pons p. 139"&gt;Pons, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the Bolshevik government's economic development realised the [[Industrialization in the USSR#Industrialization in practice|rapid industrialisation]] of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] with [[Realpolitik|pragmatic]] programs of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] that transplanted peasant populations to the cities, where they became [[industrial workers]], who then became the workforce of the new factories and industries. Likewise, the farmer populations worked the [[Collectivisation in the Soviet Union|system of collective farms]] to grow food to feed the industrial workers in the industrialised cities. Hence, the Marxist–Leninist society of Russia in the 1930s featured austere equality based upon [[asceticism]], [[egalitarianism]] and [[self-sacrifice]]—yet the Bolshevik Party recognised human nature and semi-officially allowed some [[consumerism]] (limited, small-scale capitalism) to stimulate the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economy of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pons, p. 732.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the socialist society was conceptually equal to the communist society. In defining the differences of political economy between [[socialism]] and [[communism]], Lenin instead explained their conceptual similarity to Marx's descriptions of the lower-stage and the upper-stage of economic development; that immediately after a proletarian revolution in the lower-stage (socialist) society, the economy must be based upon the individual labour contributed by men and women; and later in the upper-stage (communist) society, the economy would be based upon requiring labour and paying wages [[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Comparative Politics'' (2012), Joel Krieger and Craig N. Murphy, Eds. Oxford University Press, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social ===

To develop a communist society, the state provides for the national [[welfare]] with [[universal healthcare]], free [[public education]] and the social benefits necessary to increase the productivity of the workers.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of 20th-Century Communism'' (2010), Silvio Pons, p. 721–723.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the planned economy, the [[welfare state]] is meant to develop the [[proletariat]]'s education (academic and technical) and their [[class consciousness]] (political education) to facilitate their contextual understanding of the historical development of communism as presented in [[Marx's theory of history]].&lt;ref&gt;Pons, p. 580.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reformation of [[family law]] eliminates [[patriarchy]] from the legal system, which facilitates the [[Women's liberation|emancipation of women]] from [[tradition]]al social inferiority and [[Exploitation of labour|economic exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pons, pp. 854–856.&lt;/ref&gt; The reformation of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] eliminates the disproportionate political and economic powers of the [[bourgeoisie]] and voids the [[private property]]-status of the [[means of production]]. The educational system imparts the social norms for a self-disciplined and self-fulfilling way of life, by which the citizens establish the social order necessary for realizing a communist society.&lt;ref&gt;Pons, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural policy [[modernisation|modernises]] social relations among the citizenry by eliminating the capitalist [[value system]] that divided people into the closed [[social class]]es of bourgeois society.&lt;ref&gt;Pons, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural changes required for establishing a communist society are effected through education and [[agitprop]] (agitation and propaganda), which reinforce communal values.&lt;ref&gt;Pons, pp. 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the educational and cultural policies of the Marxist–Leninist state is the elimination of the societal atomisation—[[anomie]] and [[social alienation]]—caused by [[cultural backwardness]], which facilitates the development of the [[New Soviet man]], an educated and cultured citizen possessed of a proletarian [[class consciousness]] who is oriented towards the [[collectivism|social cohesion]] necessary for developing a communist society.&lt;ref&gt;Pons, p. 581.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theological ===
[[File:Christ saviour explosion.jpg|thumb|300px|In establishing the USSR's policy of official atheism, Stalin ordered the razing of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], in Moscow, in 1931.]]

The Marxist–Leninist world view is [[Atheism|atheist]], wherein all human activity results from human [[Volition (psychology)|volition]], and not the will of [[Supernaturalism|supernatural beings]] (gods, goddesses, and demons) who have direct [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] in the public and private affairs of human society.&lt;ref&gt;Thrower, James. ''Marxism–Leninism as the Civil Religion of Soviet Society'' E. Mellen Press, 1992. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kundan, Kumar. ''Ideology and Political System'' (2003) Discovery Publishing House, 2003. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The tenets of the Soviet Union's national policy of [[Marxist–Leninist atheism]] originated from the philosophies of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] (1804–1872), and of [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and [[Lenin]] (1870–1924).&lt;ref&gt;''Slovak Studies'', Volume 21. The Slovak Institute in North America. p. 231. "The origin of Marxist–Leninist atheism, as understood in the USSR, is linked with the development of the German philosophy of Hegel and Feuerbach."&lt;/ref&gt;

As a basis of Marxism–Leninism, the philosophy of [[materialism]] (the [[Universe|physical universe]] exists independently of [[Consciousness|human consciousness]]) is applied as [[dialectical materialism]] (a philosophy of science and [[Nature]]) to examine the socio-economic relations among people and things, as parts of a dynamic, material world that is unlike the immaterial world of [[Metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wadenstrom.net/texter/madi.htm "Materialistisk dialektik"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923172817/http://www.wadenstrom.net/texter/madi.htm |date=23 September 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Z. A.''The Evolution of Dialectical Materialism'' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Thomas, ''Marxism and Scientific Socialism: From Engels to Althusser'' (London: Routledge, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet astrophysicist [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] said that, ideologically, the "Bolshevik communists were not merely atheists, but, according to Lenin's terminology, ''militant atheists''" in excluding religion from the social mainstream, from education, and from government.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg, Vitalij Lazarevič, ''On Superconductivity and Superfluidity: A Scientific Autobiography'' (2009) p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International relations ===
The Marxist–Leninist approach to [[international relations]] derives from the analyses (political and economic, sociological and geopolitical) that Lenin presented in the essay ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] '' (1917). Parting from and developing the philosophical bases of Marxism—(i) that human history is the history of [[class struggle]], between a ruling class and an exploited class; (ii) that [[capitalism]] creates antagonistic [[social class]]es: the exploiters, the [[bourgeoisie]]; and the exploited, the [[proletariat]]; (iii) that capitalism employs [[Nationalism|nationalist war]] to further private economic expansion; (iv) that [[socialism]] is an economic system that voids social classes through [[public ownership]], and so will eliminate the economic causes of war; and (v) that once the state ([[Socialist state|socialist]] or [[Communist state|communist]]) withers away, so shall international relations wither away because they are projections of national economic forces—Lenin said that the capitalists' exhaustion of domestic sources of investment profit, by way of price-fixing [[Trust (business)|trust]]s and [[cartel]]s, then prompts the same capitalists to export [[investment capital]] to undeveloped countries to finance the [[exploitation of natural resources]] and the native populations, to create new markets. That the capitalists' control of national politics ensures the government's safeguarding of [[Colonialism|colonial]] investments and the consequent imperial competition for economic supremacy provokes international wars to protect their national interests.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Penguin Dictionary of International Relations'' (1998), Graham Evans and Jeffrey Newnham, Eds. pp. 316–317.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the vertical perspective (social-class relations) of Marxism–Leninism, the internal and international affairs of a country are a political continuum, not separate realms of human activity, which is the philosophic opposite of the horizontal perspectives (country-to-country) of the [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberal]] and the [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] approaches to international relations. Therefore, colonial imperialism is the inevitable consequence  in the course of economic relations among countries when the domestic price-fixing of [[Monopoly|monopoly capitalism]] has voided profitable competition in the capitalist homeland. As such, the ideology of [[New Imperialism]]—rationalised as a [[civilising mission]]—allowed the exportation of high-profit investment capital to undeveloped countries with uneducated, native populations (sources of cheap labour), plentiful raw materials for exploitation (factors for manufacture), and a colonial market to consume the [[surplus production]], which the capitalist homeland cannot consume; the example is the European [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881–1914), which was safeguarded by the national military.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

To secure the colonies—foreign sources of new capital-investment-profit—the imperialist state seeks either political or military control of the limited resources (natural and human); the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914–1918) resulted from such geopolitical conflicts among the empires of Europe over colonial [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Historical terms'' (1998), Chris Cook, Ed., p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; For the colonised working classes who create the wealth (goods and services), the elimination of war for natural resources (access, control and exploitation) is resolved by overthrowing the [[Militarism|militaristic]] capitalist state and establishing a socialist state as a peaceful world economy is feasible only by [[proletarian revolution]]s that overthrow systems of [[political economy]] based upon the [[exploitation of labour]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== History ==
=== Bolshevism ===
The philosophy of Marxism–Leninism originated as the pro-active, political praxis of the Bolshevik (Majority) faction, the left-wing of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP).&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin's leadership made the Bolshevik faction the RSDLP's vanguard, i.e. committed, professional revolutionaries who elected leaders and determined policy by way of [[democratic centralism]].&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1991"/&gt; The Bolsheviks' [[Vanguardism|pragmatic commitment]] to achieving revolution was their practical advantage in out-manoeuvring political parties that advocate [[social democracy]] without a plan of action, thus the Bolshevik Party successfully assumed command of the [[October Revolution]] in 1917.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1991"&gt;Bottomore, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== February Revolution ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H28740, St. Petersburg, Eröffnung der Parlamente.jpg|thumb|300px|In 1906, after the failed February Revolution of 1905,  Tsar Nicholas II addressed the two chambers of the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]], at the Winter Palace]].
[[File:LeninEnSuizaMarzo1916--barbaroussovietr00mcbr.png|thumb|300px|The failed February Revolution (1905–1907) against Tsar Nicholas II exiled Lenin from Imperial Russia to Switzerland. (March 1905)]]
Twelve years before the October Revolution, Lenin and the Bolsheviks had failed to assume control of the [[1905 Russian Revolution|February Revolution of 1905]], because the centres of revolutionary action were too far apart for proper political co-ordination.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts2"&gt;Bottomore, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; To generate revolutionary momentum—from Tsarist violence such as the killings on [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]] (22 January 1905)—the Bolsheviks advocated militant action, that the workers use political violence to compel the bourgeois middle classes (the nobility, the gentry, the bourgeoisie) to join the [[proletarian revolution]] to overthrow the [[absolute monarchy]] of the [[Tsar of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulam, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite secret police persecution by the ''[[Okhrana]]'' (Department for Protecting the Public Security and Order), émigré Bolsheviks returned to Russia to agitate, organise and lead; and when revolutionary fervour failed in 1907, returned to exile (Lenin to Switzerland).&lt;ref name="intellectual1965"&gt;Ulam, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the February Revolution (1905–1907) exiled the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] (Majority) and the [[Mensheviks]] (Minority), the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]] and the [[Black Guards|anarchists]] from [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]—a political defeat aggravated by [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]]'s agreement to reforming government. In practice, the formalities of the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]], the political plurality of a [[multi-party system]] of elections; and the [[Russian Constitution of 1906]], were piecemeal social concessions that favoured only the [[aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]], the [[gentry]] and the [[bourgeoisie]]—but they did not resolve the [[malnutrition]], [[illiteracy]] and [[Poverty|poverty]] of the proletarian majority of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Ulam, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; In Swiss exile, Lenin developed Marx's philosophy and extrapolated [[Decolonisation|colonial revolt]] as a reinforcement of proletarian revolution in Europe.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts3"&gt;Bottomore, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later in 1912, Lenin resolved a factional challenge to his ideological leadership of the RSDLP by the Forward Group in the party by usurping the all-party congress and then transformed the RSDLP into the [[Bolshevik Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulam, pp. 282–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Great War ===
As promised to the Russian peoples in October 1917, the Bolsheviks quit Russia's participation in the [[Great War]], on 3 March 1918, unlike the European socialists who chose bellicose nationalism rather than anti-war internationalism, consequent to the [[Internationalist–defencist schism]] among themselves.&lt;ref name="university1995"&gt;Anderson, Kevin. ''Lenin, Hegel, and Western Marxism: A Critical Study'' (1995) Chicago, Illinois, USA: University of Illinois Press, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; To that effect, a small group of anti-war socialist leaders, including [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Karl Liebknecht]], and Lenin, denounced the European socialists' forsaking the solidarity of working-class internationalism for patriotic war.&lt;ref name="university1995"/&gt; In the essay ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (1917), Lenin explained that capitalist expansion leads to colonial imperialism, which is regulated with wars—such as the Great War among the empires of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Penguin Dictionary of International Relations'' (1998), Graham Evans and Jeffrey Newnham, Eds., p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cavanagh Hodge, Carl.

=== October Revolution and civil war ===

[[File:Bela.Kun.Revolution.1919.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Béla Kun]], leader of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], speaks to supporters during the Hungarian Revolution of 1919]]
In March 1917, the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II led to the [[Russian Provisional Government]] (March–July 1917), who then proclaimed the [[Russian Republic]] (September–November 1917). Later, in the [[October Revolution]], the Bolshevik's ''[[coup d'état]]'' against the Provisional Government resulted in their establishment of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (1917–1991); yet parts of Russia remained occupied by the counter-revolutionary [[White Movement]] of Tsarist and anti-communist military commanders who had united to form the [[White Army]] to fight the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–1922) against the Bolshevik régime. Despite the White–Red civil war, Russia remained a combatant in the Great War (1914–1918), which the Bolshevik's had quit with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (3 March 1918), which then provoked the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied Intervention to the Russian Civil War]] (1918–1925) by the armies of seventeen countries, featuring Great Britain, France, and Italy, the United States and Imperial Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, the Bolsheviks consolidated government power by expelling the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries from the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]].&lt;ref name="dictatorships1918"&gt;Lee, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolshevik government then established the ''[[Cheka]]'' secret police to eliminate anti–Bolshevik opposition in Russia. Initial opposition to the Bolshevik régime was strong, for not having resolved the food shortages and material poverty of the Russian peoples, as they had promised in October 1917; from that social discontent, the Cheka reported 118 uprisings, including the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] (7–17 March 1921).&lt;ref name="dictatorships1918"/&gt;

; Nationalisation and War Communism
The Bolshevik government introduced limited [[nationalisation]] of the [[means of production]], which had been private property of the Russian aristocracy during the Tsarist monarchy.&lt;ref name="dictatorships2"&gt;Lee, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfil the promised redistribution of Russia's arable land, Lenin encouraged the peasantry to reclaim their farmlands from the aristocrats and so ensured the peasantry's political loyalty to the Bolshevik Party.&lt;ref name="dictatorships2"/&gt; In mid-1918, to overcome the civil war's economic interruption, the [[War Communism]] policy featured a [[regulated market]], state-control of the means of distribution and the [[Soviet Decree|Decree on Nationalisation]] of large-scale farms, which requisitioned grain to feed industrial workers in the cities and the Red Army in the field, all while fighting the White Army, who was seeking to re-establish the [[Romanov]] dynasty as [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchs]] of Russia.&lt;ref name="dictatorships2"/&gt; Politically, the forced grain-requisitions discouraged peasants from farming, which resulted in reduced-harvests and food-shortages, which in turn provoked labour strikes and food riots. With the economic chaos—caused by the Bolshevik government's voiding the monetary economy—the Russian people replaced with [[barter]] and the [[black market]].&lt;ref name="dictatorships2"/&gt; 

; New Economic Policy
In 1921, the [[New Economic Policy]] restored some private enterprise to animate the Russian economy. As part of Lenin's pragmatic compromise with external financial interests in 1918, Bolshevik [[state capitalism]] temporarily returned 91 per cent of industry to private ownership—until the Soviet Russians learned to operate and administrate said industries.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Historical Terms'' Second Edition (1998), Chris Cook, Ed., p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictatorships2"/&gt; In that vein, Lenin explained that developing socialism in Russia would proceed according to the material and socio-economic conditions of Russia and not as described by Marx in the 19th century. Lenin's pragmatic explanation was the following: "Our poverty is so great that we cannot, at one stroke, restore full-scale factory, state, socialist production".&lt;ref name="dictatorships2"/&gt; To overcome the lack of educated Russians who could operate and administrate industry, Lenin advocated the development of a [[Intelligentsia|technical intelligentsia]] who would propel the industrial development of Russia to self-sufficiency.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts2"/&gt;

The principal obstacles to Russian economic development and modernisation were great [[Poverty|material poverty]] and the lack of modern technology, which conditions [[orthodox Marxism]] considered unfavourable to communist revolution; and that agricultural Russia was right for developing capitalism, but wrong for the development of socialism.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts2"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ulam, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1921–1924 period was tumultuous in Russia, with the simultaneous occurrence of economic recovery, famine (1921–1922) and a financial crisis (1924).&lt;ref name="dictatorships3"&gt;Lee, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1924, the Bolshevik government had achieved much economic progress and by 1926 the production levels of the Soviet Union's economy had risen to the production levels registered in 1913.&lt;ref name="dictatorships3"/&gt;

; Revolutionary consequences
Elsewhere, the successful [[October Revolution]] in Russia facilitated communist revolution in Imperial Germany and in Hungary during the 1918–1920 period. In Berlin, the German government and their ''[[Freikorps]]'' mercenaries fought and defeated the [[Spartacist uprising]] (4–5 January 1919), which began as a [[general strike]]; and in Munich, likewise fought and defeated the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] (April 1919). In Hungary, the workers proclaimed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] (March–August 1919), which was defeated by the royal armies of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the army of [[Czechoslovakia]]. In Asia, successful Mongolian communist revolution established the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] (1924–1992).

; Lenin's warning
In his political testament (December 1922) to the Communist Party, Lenin ordered Stalin removed from being the party's [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] and replaced with "some other person who is superior to Stalin only in one respect, namely, in being more tolerant, more loyal, more polite, and more attentive to comrades".&lt;ref name="dictatorships4"&gt;Lee, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; At his death on 21 January 1924, [[Lenin's testament]] was read aloud to the Central Committee of the party, but enough committeemen believed in Stalin's political rehabilitation in 1923 and ignored Lenin's order to remove Stalin.&lt;ref name="dictatorships4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dictatorships5"&gt;Lee, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Power struggle
Consequent to personally spiteful disputes about the praxis of [[Leninism]], to the October Revolution veterans, [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]], the true, ideological threat to the integrity of the Communist Party was Trotsky—a personally charismatic political-leader; the commanding officer of the [[Red Army]] in the civil war; and revolutionary partner of the dead Lenin.&lt;ref name="dictatorships5"/&gt; To thwart Trotsky's likely election to head the Communist Party, Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev formed a ''[[triumvirate|Troika]]'' (Triumvirate), wherein Stalin was General Secretary of the Communist Party—the ''de facto'' [[Power (social and political)|centre of power]] in the party and the country.&lt;ref name="dictatorships6"&gt;Lee, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The direction of the Communist Party was decided in the confrontation of politics and personality—between Stalin's ''Troika'' and Trotsky—over which Marxist policy to pursue, namely Trotsky's policy of [[permanent revolution]] or Stalin's policy of [[socialism in one country]].&amp;nbsp;Permanent revolution featured rapid industrialisation of the economy, the [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivisation]] of private farmlands and the Soviet Union's promotion of worldwide communist revolution.&lt;ref name="dictatorships7"&gt;Lee, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Socialism in one country featured moderate-pace national development and the establishment of economic and diplomatic relations with other countries in order to increase international trade with and foreign investment in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="dictatorships6"/&gt;

To politically isolate and oust Trotsky from the party, Stalin expediently advocated the politics of socialism in one country—to which he was indifferent.&lt;ref name="dictatorships7"/&gt; In 1925, the [[14th Communist Party Congress]] approved Stalin's policy and Trotsky was politically defeated as a possible rival leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="dictatorships7"/&gt;

In the 1925–1927 period, Stalin dissolved the ''Troika'' and disowned the moderate Kamenev and Zinoviev for an expedient alliance with the equally opportunistic [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Alexei Rykov]] (Premier of Russia, 1924–1929; Premier of the Soviet Union, 1924–1930)&lt;ref name=Rykov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/rus/rus_govt1/rykov.php|title=''Aleksey Ivanovich Rykov'' biography —Archontology|access-date=1 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142905/http://www.archontology.org/nations/rus/rus_govt1/rykov.php|archive-date=12 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mikhail Tomsky]] (leader of the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions)—the most right-wing Revolution-era Bolsheviks in the party.&lt;ref name="dictatorships7"/&gt; The 1927 Communist Party Conference endorsed Stalin's socialism in one country as the national policy for the Soviet Union and expelled Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev from the party's [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]].&lt;ref name="dictatorships7"/&gt;

; Power consolidated
In 1929, Stalin had assumed control (personal and political) of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union proper by way of deception and administrative acumen.&lt;ref name="dictatorships7"/&gt; By then, the Stalinist régime of socialism in one country had associated revolutionary [[Bolshevism]] with the harsh socio-economic policies that a centralised state required to realise the rapid industrialisation of the cities and the collectivisation of agriculture in Russia as well as to subordinate the national interests of the world's communist parties to the [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] interests of the Soviet Communist Party.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1991"/&gt;

In the 1929–1932 period of the [[first five-year plan]], Stalin effected the [[dekulakization]] of Russian farmlands, a politically radical and harsh dispossession of the [[kulak]] class of peasant-landlords, about which Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky had moderate-action recommendations to ameliorate the policy. Stalin&amp;nbsp;took umbrage and accused them of un-communist betrayals of Marxism and Leninism.&lt;ref name="dictatorships7"/&gt; From that implicit accusation of [[Deviationism|ideological deviation]], Stalin then accused the three October Revolution veterans of plotting against the party and compelled their resignations from public office and from their posts in the Politburo.&lt;ref name="dictatorships7"/&gt;

To complete his purge of the Communist Party, Stalin then exiled Trotsky from the Soviet Union in 1929.&lt;ref name="dictatorships7"/&gt; From 1929 onwards, internal opposition to Stalin's régime created [[Trotskyism]] (Bolshevik–Leninism), which was outlawed as ideological deviance from Marxism–Leninism, the state ideology of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1991"/&gt;

; Power legalised
In the 1929–1941 period, Stalin's elimination of Bolshevik rivals ended democracy in the Communist Party and replaced them with his personal control of the party's institutions.&lt;ref name="dictatorships9"/&gt; The ranks and files of the Communist Party increased with members from the trade unions and from the factories, whom he controlled because there were no other Bolsheviks to contradict Stalin's version of Marxism–Leninism.&lt;ref name="dictatorships9"/&gt; In 1936, the Soviet Union adopted a new, [[1936 Soviet Constitution|political constitution]] which ended weighted-voting preferences for workers and promulgated [[universal suffrage]] for every man and woman older than 18 years of age; and organised the soviets (councils of workers) into two legislatures ([[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]]): (i) the [[Soviet of the Union]] (representing electoral districts); and (ii) the [[Soviet of Nationalities]] (representing the ethnic groups of the country); and by 1939 he had either killed or expelled from the Communist Party all of the Bolsheviks from the October Revolution era.&lt;ref name="dictatorships9"/&gt;

; Dictator of the Soviet Union
Under guise of governing by the principles of Marxism–Leninism, Stalin's [[Dictator|dictatorial régime]] made the Soviet Union a [[police state]] unlike Lenin's [[socialist state]] of the Bolshevik period.&lt;ref name="dictatorships8"&gt;Lee, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive personal control over the men who were the Communist Party licensed Stalin to use [[political violence]] to eliminate anyone who might be a threat—real, potential, or imagined.&lt;ref name="dictatorships8"/&gt;

As an administrator, Stalin governed the Soviet Union by controlling the formulation of national policy and delegated implementation to subordinate Communist Party functionaries. Such freedom of action allowed local communist functionaries much discretion to interpret the intent of orders from Moscow, which allowed their corruption.&lt;ref name="dictatorships8"/&gt; To Stalin, the correction of such abuses of authority and economic corruption were responsibility of the secret police, the [[NKVD]] (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs).&lt;ref name="dictatorships8"/&gt; With the [[Great Purge]] (1936–1938), Stalin rid himself of internal enemies in the party and rid Russia of every counter-revolutionary, reactionary and socially dangerous man and woman who might offer legitimate political opposition to Marxism–Leninism. In the 1937–1938 period, the NKVD arrested 1.5 million people from every stratum of the Communist Party and of soviet society and killed 681,692 people for political reasons.&lt;ref name="Pons p. 447"&gt;Pons, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; To provide manpower (intellectual and manual) to realise the construction projects for Stalin's rapid industrialisation of Russia, the NKVD established the ''[[Gulag]]'' system of [[Forced labour|forced-labour]] camps for criminal convicts and political dissidents, for artists and intellectuals, for homosexual people and religious anti-communists.&lt;ref name="dictatorships9"&gt;Lee, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialism in one country (1929–1941) ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R85625, Sowjetunion, Hüttenkombinat in Magnitogorsk.jpg|thumb|300px|The metallurgical combine in [[Magnitogorsk]] in 1929 demonstrates the [[Soviet Union]]'s rapid [[industrialisation]] in the 1920s and 1930s]]
; Rapid industrialisation
[[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union]] achieved the rapid industrialisation (coal, iron and steel, electricity, petroleum and so on) and the collectivisation of agriculture&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm, Eric. ''The Age of Extremes: A History of the World, 1914–1991'' (1996), pp. 380–81&lt;/ref&gt;—achieving 23.6% collectivisation within one year (1930) and 98% collectivisation within twelve years (1941).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s—the time of the Russian Civil War (1917–1922) and the seventeen foreign armies of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War (1918–1925)—as the revolutionary vanguard of the nation the Communist Party had organised Russian society to realise the rapid industrialisation programs as defence against Western interference with Bolshevik Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapid industrialisation accelerated the Russians' sociological transition from the poverty of Tsarist [[serfdom]] to the relative plenty of Communist self-determination as peasants became urban citizens.&lt;ref name="dictatorships11"&gt;Lee, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, the Marxist–Leninist economic régime modernised Russia from an illiterate, peasant society under Tsarist monarchy to a [[Literacy|literate]] society of farmers and industrial workers under socialism. Unemployment was almost nil.&lt;ref name="dictatorships11"/&gt;

; Social engineering
In 1934, Stalin's development of Soviet society contradicted and then replaced, the social, cultural and intellectual freedoms of Lenin's Bolshevik period. In education, traditional Russian [[authoritarianism]] (harsh discipline, school uniforms and so on) replaced [[Pedagogy|pedagogic]] experimentation and relaxed social conduct; mental conformity, rather than intellectual liberty.&lt;ref name="dictatorships10"&gt;Lee, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally, the Russian arts were subordinated to the ideological limitations of [[socialist realism]], a form of Russian [[patriarchy]] admired by the traditionalist Stalin.&lt;ref name="dictatorships10"/&gt; Organised religion was excluded from the political mainstream of Soviet society and was repressed whenever a religious organisation openly opposed the official atheism of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="dictatorships10"/&gt;

; International relations
In 1933, the Marxist–Leninist geopolitical perspective was that the Soviet Union was surrounded by capitalist and anti-communist enemies, for which reason the election of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the concomitant [[Nazi Party]] government in Germany initially resulted in the Soviet Union severing political and diplomatic relations established in the 1920s. In 1938, Stalin turned to accommodate [[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Western world|West]] in defence against Hitler's threat of pre-emptive warfare to "recover" the [[Sudetenland]], the German peoples and lands within Czecho.&lt;ref name="dictatorships12"&gt;Lee, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

To challenge [[Nazi Germany]]'s bid for European supremacy and hegemony, Stalin promoted [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] fronts throughout Europe with socialists, democrats and so on and entered political agreements with France to counter Nazi Germany in the west of Europe.&lt;ref name="dictatorships12"/&gt; After the Nazis bluffed the British into the [[Munich Agreement]] (29 September 1938) that allowed the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] (1938–1945), Stalin reversed his anti-German foreign policy and adopted pro-German policies.&lt;ref name="dictatorships12"/&gt; In 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany agreed to both a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Treaty of Non-aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, 23 August 1939) and agreed to jointly [[Invasion of Poland|invade and partition Poland]] by which Nazi Germany started [[World War II]] on 1 September 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Great Patriotic War (1941–1945) ===
In the 1941–1942 period of the [[Great Patriotic War]], the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] (Operation Barbarossa, 22 June 1941) was ineffectively opposed by the [[Red Army]], who were poorly led, ill-trained and under-equipped and so fought poorly and suffered great losses of dead and wounded and prisoners of war. Such Soviet military weakness was one consequence of the [[Great Purge]] of senior officers and career soldiers.&lt;ref name="dictatorships13"&gt;Lee, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive and greatly effective Nazi attack threatened the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union and the political integrity of Stalin's Marxist–Leninist state because the Nazis were initially welcomed as liberators by nationalist, anti-communist and anti-Soviet populations in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

The nationalists' [[Collaborationism|collaboration]] with the anti-communist Nazi occupier lasted until the ''[[SS]]'' and the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' began their ''[[Lebensraum]]'' killings, i.e. the [[Holocaust|genocide]] of the Jewish communities and the systematic extermination of communists and civil leaders to realise the [[ethnic cleansing]] of Soviet lands for German colonisation. In response, Stalin ordered the Red Army to fight campaigns of [[total war]] against the exterminating invaders of Russia. Hitler's attack against his erstwhile Communist ally, realigned Stalin's policies and priorities from the repression of internal enemies to the existential defence of Russia against an external enemy, namely the aggressively anti-Communist [[Third Reich]]. The Nazi attack compelled Stalin to a pragmatic [[Allies of World War II|alliance]] with the [[Allies of World War II|Western Powers]] in common front against the [[Axis Powers]]—[[Nazi Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922-1943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Imperial Japan]].

Elsewhere in the countries invaded by the [[Axis powers]], the native communist party usually led armed resistance ([[guerrilla warfare]] and [[urban guerrilla warfare]]) against military occupation. In Asia, Stalin ordered the [[Communist Party of China]], led by [[Mao Zedong]], to abandon the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1937–1941) and collaborate with the anti-communist [[Kuomintang]] as the [[Second United Front]] in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), the occupation of China. In Mediterranean Europe, the Communist [[Yugoslav Partisans]], led by [[Josip Broz Tito]], effectively resisted the Nazi and Fascist occupation. In the 1943–1944 period, Tito's Partisans liberated territories with Red Army assistance and established the Communist political authority that became the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

; Communist victory
In 1943, the Red Army began to repel the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, especially at the five-month [[Battle of Stalingrad]] (23 August 1942–2 February 1943) and at the eleven-day [[Battle of Kursk]] (5–16 April 1943); and afterwards repelled the Nazi and Fascist occupation armies from Russia and the countries of Eastern Europe until decisive defeat in Germany proper, with the [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Strategic Offensive Operation]] (16 April–2 May 1945).&lt;ref name="dictatorships14"&gt;Lee, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; On concluding the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945), the Soviet Union was a military superpower who had a say in the [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] order of the world.&lt;ref name="dictatorships14"/&gt; In that vein and in accordance with the three-power [[Yalta Agreement]] (4–11 February 1945), the Soviet Union purged [[Collaborationism|native Fascist collaborators]] from the Eastern European countries occupied by the Axis Powers and afterwards installed native Communist governments to establish a geographic buffer-zone of [[satellite state]]s to protect the borders of Russia.

=== Cold War&amp;nbsp;(1945–1991) ===
[[File:Mao proclaiming the establishment of the PRC in 1949.jpg|thumb|300px|On 1 October 1949, [[Mao Zedong]], [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]], declared the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]]]]
[[File:John Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev 1961.jpg|thumb|300px|In June 1961, the Soviet General Secretary, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], met with the U.S. President, [[John F. Kennedy]], whilst effecting the [[de-Stalinisation]] of the Soviet Union. His official denunciation of [[Stalin's cult of personality]] purged [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; and allowed increased freedom of expression.]]

Upon Allied victory concluding the Second World War (1939–1945), the expediently suppressed, pre-war [[geopolitics|geopolitical rivalries]] and ideological tensions that existed among the Allies resumed, and broke their anti-[[Fascism|fascist]] war-time alliance into the Anti-communist [[Western Bloc]] and the Communist [[Eastern Bloc]]. The renewed geopolitical competition for regional [[hegemony]] resulted in the [[Cold War]] (1945–1991) — a protracted state of military and diplomatic tension between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., which often threatened war.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Historical Terms'', Second Edition, Chris Cook, Ed. pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the events that precipitated the Cold War were the Soviet and Yugoslav, Bulgarian and Albanian military interventions to the [[Greek Civil War]] (1944–1949), in behalf of the Greek Communists;&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Wars'' Third Edition (2007) George Childs Kohn, Ed., p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948–1949) by the Soviet Union. In continental Asia, the event that precipitated the Cold War was the resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1930–34; 1945–1950) fought between the anti-communist [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]]; after the military defeat of the Kuomintang, and expelling General [[Chiang Kai-shek]] to the island of [[Taiwan]], Mao Zedong proclaimed and established the [[People's Republic of China]] (1 October 1949).&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Wars'' Third Edition (2007) George Childs Kohn, Ed., pp. 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eastern Asia, the Cold War produced the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953), the first land-war in continental Asia fought between the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, which resulted from dual origins: (i) the nationalist Koreans' post-war resumption of the [[Korean Civil War]]; and (ii) an imperial [[proxy war]] for regional hegemony, sponsored by the Soviet Union and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Wars'' Third Edition (2007) George Childs Kohn, Ed., pp. 291–92.&lt;/ref&gt; The international response to the North Korean invasion of South Korea was realised by the [[United Nations Security Council]] who voted for war—despite the absent Soviet Union—and authorised the intervention of an international military expedition to expel the northern invaders from the south of Korea, and thus restore the geopolitical ''status quo ante'' of the post–WWII [[division of Korea]] at the 38th Parallel of global latitude, by the Soviets and the Americans. Consequent to Chinese military intervention in behalf of Communist North Korea, the magnitude of the infantry warfare reached operational and geographic [[stalemate]]; afterwards, the shooting war was ended with the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] (27 July 1953); and the superpower Cold War in Asia then resumed as the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]].

== De-Stalinization ==
===Eastern Bloc===
[[File:Josip Broz Tito uniform portrait.jpg|thumb|300px|In 1948, [[Josip Broz Tito]], leader of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], rejected the hegemony of Stalin's Soviet Union, who then expelled leader and nation from the [[Cominform]].]]

====Socialist Yugoslavia====
The geopolitics of the [[Eastern bloc]] countries under the [[hegemony]] of Stalinist Russia featured an official-and-personal style of socialist diplomacy that failed Stalin and Tito, and led to the [[Tito–Stalin Split]], when Tito said "No." to subordinating Yugoslavia to Russia. Circumstance and cultural personality aggravated the matter into an official diplomatic break, the [[Yugoslav–Soviet Split]] in 1948. The break between the Marxist-Leninist communists, Tito and Stalin, resulted from Tito's rejection of Stalin's political demand that he subordinate [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Socialist Yugoslavia]] to the geopolitical agenda (economic and military) of the Soviet Union, i.e. Tito at Stalin's disposal.

Stalin punished the refusal by denouncing Tito as a bad communist, an [[Revisionism (Marxism)|ideological revisionist]] of Marxism–Leninism; by denouncing Socialist Yugoslavia's practice of Titoism as [[deviationism|socialism deviated]] from the cause of [[world communism]]; and by expelling the Yugoslav communists from the [[Cominform|Communist Information Bureau]] (Cominform). The break from Eastern-bloc Stalinism allowed the development of [[Titoism]], the Yugoslav variety of Marxism–Leninism that allowed doing business with the capitalist West to develop the [[socialist economy]], and the establishment of Socialist Yugoslavia's diplomatic and commercial relations with countries of the Eastern and Western blocs; international relations that matured into the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (1961) of countries without political allegiance to any [[power bloc]].

====USSR====
At the death of Stalin in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became leader of the Soviet Union and of the CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union), and then consolidated an anti-Stalinist government. Three years later, in a secret meeting at the 20th congress of the CPSU, Khruschev denounced [[Stalin]] and [[Stalinism]] in the speech ''[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|On the Cult of Personality and its Consequences]]'' (25 February 1956) in which he specified and condemned Stalin's dictatorial excesses and abuses of power, such as the [[Great purge]] (1936–38) and the [[cult of personality]]. Khrushchev thus introduced the [[de-Stalinisation]] of the Party and of the Soviet Union, which he realised with the dismantling of the [[Gulag|Gulag archipelago]] of forced-labour camps and freeing the prisoners; allowing Soviet civil society greater political freedom of expression, especially for public intellectuals of the [[Intelligentsia]], such as the novelist [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], whose literature obliquely criticised Stalin and the Stalinist [[police state]]. De-Stalinization also ended Stalin's national-purpose policy of [[socialism in one country]], which was replaced with [[proletarian internationalism]], by way of which Khrushchev re-committed the Soviet Union to [[permanent revolution]] to realise [[world communism]]. In that geopolitical vein, Khrushchev presented de-Stalinization as the restoration of [[Leninism]] as the official state ideology of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cold War: The United States and the Soviet Union, 1917–1991'', by Ronald E. Powaski. Oxford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maoism ==
In the 1960s, the People's Republic of China developed Maoism (the Mao Zedong Thought) as a Chinese variant of Marxism–Leninism which later provoked ideological, political and nationalist tensions between the Soviet Union and China about the correct orthodox-interpretation of Marxist–Leninist ideology. Given the different stages of Russian and Chinese development, the Communists' intractable ideological arguments  provoked the [[Sino-Soviet split]] (1956–1966).&lt;ref name="World History 2000. p. 769"/&gt;

Afterwards, China pursued ''[[détente]]'' with the United States as a challenge to the Soviet Union for the leadership of the international communist movement. China's pragmatic overture permitted geopolitical rapprochement and facilitated [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|President Nixon's 1972 visit to China]], which subsequently ended the American policy of "two Chinas" when the United States sponsored the People's Republic of China to replace the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) to representing the Chinese people at the [[United Nations]]. The People's Republic of China then took a seat in the Security Council.

In the post-Mao period, [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1982–1987) effected policies of [[Economic liberalism|economic liberalisation]] which resulted in continual economic growth for the country. The ideological justification is [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], the adaption of Russian Marxism–Leninism to China.

== Marxist–Leninist revolution ==
[[File:CheyFidel.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Che Guevara]] and [[Fidel Castro]], leader of the [[Republic of Cuba]] (1959–2008)]]
[[File:Nlfmainforce.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Viet Cong]] guerillas during the [[Vietnam War]]]]
In Latin America, Communist revolutions based upon Marxism–Leninism occurred in Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador, Grenada, Nicaragua, Peru and Uruguay. In 1959, the [[Cuban Revolution]], led by [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara|Ché Guevara]], overthrew the régime (1925–1959) of [[Fulgencio Batista]] to establish the [[Republic of Cuba]], a Communist state recognised by the Soviet Union. In response, the United States attempted a coup d'état against the Castro government, such as the unsuccessful [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] (April 1961), by anti-communist Cuban exiles, sponsored by the CIA. The next year, there occurred the [[Cuban missile crisis]] (October 1962), a diplomatic dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union over the presence of medium-range, Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. The Soviet Union resolved the nuclear-missile crisis by removing their missiles from Cuba in exchange for the United States removing their nuclear missiles from the Turkey–Soviet Union border. In Bolivia, the Communist revolution included Guevara until his execution by the Bolivian Army. In Uruguay, the [[Tupamaros]] movement was active from the 1960s to the 1970s.

In 1970, there occurred the [[October Crisis]] in Canada, a brief revolution in the province of [[Quebec]], where the separatist ''[[Front de libération du Québec]]'' (FLQ) kidnapped James Cross, the British Trade Commissioner in Canada; and [[Pierre Laporte]], the Quebec government minister, who was killed. The FLQ's manifesto condemned English-Canadian imperialism in French Québec and called for a ''Québecois'' socialist state. The harsh Canadian government response included suspension of civil liberties in Quebec, which compelled the FLQ leaders' flight to Cuba.

In 1979, [[Daniel Ortega]], leader of the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]], became head of state of Nicaragua upon winning the Nicaraguan civil war. Within months, the United States government of [[Ronald Reagan]] then sponsored the [[Contras]] in a secret war (1979–1990) against Nicaragua. In 1983, the [[United States invasion of Grenada]] impeded the assumption of power by the [[New Jewel Movement]] (1973–1983), a vanguard party led by [[Maurice Bishop]]. The [[Salvadoran Civil War]] (1979–1992) featured the popularly supported [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]], an organisation of left-wing parties fighting against the right-wing military government of El Salvador.

The [[Vietnam War]] (1945–1975) was the second East–West war that occurred in Asia during the Cold War. After the Vietnamese Communists led by [[Ho Chi Minh]] defeated the French re-establishment of European colonialism in Viet Nam, the United States replaced France as the Western support of the client-state [[Republic of Vietnam]] (1955–1975). Despite military superiority, the United States failed to safeguard South Vietnam from the [[Viet Cong]], the guerrilla army sponsored by North Vietnam. In 1968, North Vietnam launched the [[Tet Offensive]]. Although a military failure, the attack was successful [[psychological warfare]] that decisively turned international public opinion against the United States intervention to the Vietnamese civil war and five years later eventual United States withdrawal from the war in 1973 and the subsequent [[Fall of Saigon]] to the Vietnamese Communists forces in 1975.

Consequent to the [[Cambodian Civil War]] and in coalition with Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]], the native Cambodian Communists, the Maoist [[Khmer Rouge]] (1951–1999) led by [[Pol Pot]], established [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975–1982), a Marxist–Leninist state that featured [[Class conflict|class warfare]] to restructure the society of old Cambodia; to be effected and realised with the abolishment of [[money]] and private property, the outlawing of religion, the killing of the [[intelligentsia]] and compulsory manual labour for the [[middle class]]es by way of death-squad [[state terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern THought'' Third Edition (1999), Allan Bullock and Stephen Trombley, Eds., p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt;

To eliminate Western cultural influence, Kampuchea expelled all foreigners and effected the destruction of the urban [[bourgeoisie]] of old Cambodia, first by displacing the population of the capital city (Phnom Penh); and then by displacing the entire national populace to work the farmlands to increase food supplies. Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge purged Kampuchea of internal enemies (social class and political, cultural and ethnic) at [[Khmer Rouge Killing Fields|the killing fields]], the scope of which became [[crimes against humanity]] that destroyed 2, 700, 000 people by mass murder and genocide.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition (1999), Allan Bullock and Stephen Trombley, Eds., p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dict 192193"&gt;''Dictionary of Historical Terms'', Second Edition (1998) Chris Cook, Ed., pp. 192–193&lt;/ref&gt; That social restructuring of Cambodia included attacks against the Vietnamese ethnic minority in Kampuchea, which aggravated the historical, ethnic rivalries between the Viet and the Khmer peoples. Beginning in September 1977, Kampuchea and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] continually engaged in border clashes. In 1978, Vietnam invaded Kampuchea and captured Phnom Penh in January 1979, deposed the Maoist Khmer Rouge from government and established the [[Cambodian Liberation Front for National Renewal]] as the government of Cambodia.&lt;ref name="dict 192193"/&gt;

In the 1968–1980 period in Africa, Angola, Benin, the Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia and Zimbabwe became Marxist–Leninist states governed by their respective native peoples; Marxist–Leninist guerrillas fought the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] in three countries, [[Angola]], [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Mozambique]]; overthrew of the monarchy of [[Haile Selassie]] and established the [[Derg]] government (1974–1987) of the Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police and Territorial Army in Ethiopia; [[Robert Mugabe]] led the successful civil war to overthrow white-minority rule in [[Rhodesia]] (1965–1979) in order to establish [[Zimbabwe]]. In South Africa, the anti-communist, white-minority government—based upon the official racism of [[apartheid]]—caused much geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States. In 1976, anti-communism became morally untenable for the West when the South African government killed 176 people (students and adults) in the suppression of the [[Soweto uprising]] (June 1976), which protested Afrikaner [[cultural imperialism]], the racist imposition of [[Afrikaans]] (a European Germanic language) as the language for teaching school and as the language that black South Africans must speak to white people; and the police assassination in September 1977 of [[Steven Biko]], a leader of the [[internal resistance to apartheid]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Historical Terms'', Second Edition (1998) Chris Cook, Ed., pp. 13–13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mbuyisa Makhubu''' (born 1957 or 1958) is the 18-year-old [[South Africa]]n school boy seen carrying [[Hector Pieterson]] in a famous photograph taken by [[Sam Nzima]] after the latter was shot during the [[Soweto Uprising]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=khan&gt;{{cite news|last=Khangale|first=Ndivhuwo|title=Mystery around June 16 icon lingers on|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/mystery-around-june-16-icon-lingers-on-1.243940#.UcIy0tidHMw|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=IOL news|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the photograph was released, he was harassed by the security services, and was forced to flee [[South Africa]]. His mother, Nombulelo Makhubu, told the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] that she received a letter from him from [[Nigeria]] in 1978, but that she had not heard from him since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sosibo|first1=Kwanele|title=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-06-12-red-herrings-plague-search-for-mbuyisa-makhubu|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-06-12-red-herrings-plague-search-for-mbuyisa-makhubu|accessdate=16 June 2014|work=Mail and Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 2004, seemingly without knowledge of what had happened to her son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africasacountry.com/the-curious-tale-of-victor-vinnetou/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141111030650/http://africasacountry.com/the-curious-tale-of-victor-vinnetou/ |archivedate=2014-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mbuyisa was one of a number of South African activists given refuge in Nigeria immediately following the Soweto incident. He was one of three who were settled in a boarding high school in South-Western Nigeria - Federal Government College, Warri during the 1976/77 academic year. But all failed to settle, and had  moved on within the year.&lt;ref&gt;Direct evidence of students in the college at the time&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morris Hillquit''' (August 1, 1869 – October 8, 1933) was a founder and leader of the [[Socialist Party of America]] and prominent [[United States labor law|labor lawyer]] in [[New York City]]'s [[Lower East Side]]. Together with [[Eugene V. Debs]] and Congressman [[Victor L. Berger]], Hillquit was one of the leading public faces of American [[socialism]] during the first two decades of the 20th Century.

In November 1917, running on an anti-war platform, Hillquit garnered more than 100,000 votes as the Socialist candidate for [[Mayor of New York City]]. Hillquit would again run for Mayor of New York in 1932. He also stood as a candidate for [[United States Congress]] a total of five times over the course of his life.

==Early years==
Hillquit was born Moishe Hillkowitz on August 1, 1869, in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], the second son of German-speaking ethnic [[Jew]]ish factory owners.&lt;ref&gt;Norma Fain Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit: A Political History of an American Jewish Socialist.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1979; page 3. {{ISBN|0-313-20526-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the time he was 13, young Moishe attended a non-Jewish secular school, the [[Russian language]] Alexander Gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 15, in 1884, Moishe's father, Benjamin Hillkowitz, lost his factory in Riga and decided to leave for America to improve the family's financial situation.&lt;ref name=Pratt5&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his oldest son he set out for [[New York City]], where he procured a two-room apartment in a [[tenement house]].&lt;ref name=Loose31&gt;Morris Hillquit, ''Loose Leaves from a Busy Life.'' New York: Macmillan, 1934; pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Benjamin sent for the rest of the family and they joined him in New York.&lt;ref name=Pratt5 /&gt; The family remained poor in the new world, living in a tenement in a predominately Jewish area of the [[Lower East Side]].&lt;ref name=Pratt6&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, he worked on various short-term jobs in the New York city textile industry and as a picture frame maker in a factory.&lt;ref name=Pratt6 /&gt; Morris later remembered his family as "frightfully poor," with his older brother and sisters working to help support the family.&lt;ref name=Loose31 /&gt;

Hillquit felt himself compelled to get a job to help alleviate the family's difficult financial situation.&lt;ref name=Loose31 /&gt; Since his English was poor and his body frail, employment options were limited.&lt;ref name=Loose32&gt;Hillquit, ''Loose Leaves from a Busy Life,'' pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined other young intellectual émigrés from Tsarist Russia a shirt-maker, repetitiously stitching cuffs of garments.&lt;ref name=Loose32 /&gt; In his posthumously-published memoirs, Hillquit recalled that cuff-making was "the simplest part and required least skill and training," involving the simple stitching of square pieces of cut cloth.&lt;ref name=Loose32 /&gt; The young Hillquit never progressed past that entry-level task as a shirtmaker.&lt;ref name=Loose32 /&gt;

==First political activity==
Hillquit's biographer Norma Fain Pratt remarks that Moishe was quickly drawn to the socialist movement in America:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Almost as soon as he settled in New York, Hillquit was drawn into East Side Jewish radical circles. He was then a small (5'4"), slightly built, frail adolescent with dark hair, dark oval-shaped eyes, and a gentle charming manner. He was immediately attracted to other young Jewish immigrants, mostly former students, now shop workers, who considered themselves intellectuals — a new radical ''intelligentsia''&amp;nbsp;... For the most part their radicalism was rooted in their experiences in the European socialist and [[anarchism|anarchist]] movements. But emigration and economic hardships in the United States also contributed to their further radicalization. As foreigners in America they were situated far enough outside the society to observe its failings. As frustrated but literate people, they were ambitious enough to participate in it. The young intellectuals were interested in finding alternatives to their present circumstances; their solution was to transform them.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On his 18th birthday in August 1887, the future Hillquit joined the [[Socialist Labor Party|Socialist Labor Party of America]], brought into the ranks by a fellow garment worker and Russian language socialist newspaper editor, Louis Miller. Moishe became a member of Section New York's Branch 17, a Russian-speaking unit established by Jewish émigrés from [[tsar]]ist [[Russia]] not long before his joining.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a year or so of joining the SLP, biographer Pratt notes, he became one of the party's leading crusaders against anarchism, publishing a lengthy article "Sotzializm un anarchizm" in the'' Arbeter Zeitung'' [Workers' News], a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] newspaper that he helped to establish. Hillkowitz contrasted the [[individualism]] of anarchism with the communalism of socialism in the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Hillkowitz, "Sotzializm un anarchizm," ''Arbeter zeitung,'' April 8, 1890. Cited in Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; During that time the 19-year-old Hillkowitz worked as the business manager of the ''Arbeter zeitung,'' a paper that was jointly founded with [[Abraham Cahan]], Louis Miller, and [[Morris Winchevsky]] in an effort to speak to the city's Yiddish-speaking immigrant working class about socialism in their own idiom.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Hillkowitz, ironically, was not fluent in Yiddish, having been raised with the German and Russian languages.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

He helped to found the United Hebrew Trades, a garment workers' union formed in 1888, while writing for the ''Arbeiter Zeitung''. He graduated from [[New York University Law School]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=WWNY&gt;Lewis Randolph Hamersly (ed.), ''Who's Who in New York: A Biographical Dictionary of Prominent Citizens of New York City and State.'' Seventh Edition, 1917–1918. New York: Who's Who Publications, 1918; pg. 520.&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to the [[New York State Bar Association]] in November of that same year.&lt;ref name=WWNY /&gt;

==Early socialist movement==
[[Image:Hillquit-morris-2.jpg|right|thumb|Along with orator Eugene Debs and Congressman Victor L. Berger, Hillquit was one of the most recognized public faces of the Socialist Party.]]
Hillquit led the departure of a dissident faction from [[Daniel De Leon]]'s Socialist Labor Party in 1899 and was a delegate to the group's convention at [[Rochester, New York]] in 1900.&lt;ref name=WWNY /&gt; He was a strong supporter of unity with the Chicago-based [[Social Democratic Party (United States)|Social Democratic Party]] of [[Victor Berger]] and [[Eugene V. Debs]]. In August 1901 the two groups managed to bury their differences and come together to form the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA) at a convention in [[Indianapolis]], which Hillquit also attended.&lt;ref name=WWNY /&gt;

Morris Hillquit remained one of the paramount political leaders of the Socialist Party for the rest of his life.

Hillquit was a pioneer historian of the American radical movement, publishing a broad scholarly survey in 1903 entitled ''History of Socialism in the United States.'' The book would be issued in five English-language editions during Hillquit's lifetime and would be translated into a number of the primary languages of the American socialist movement, including German, Russian, [[Yiddish]], Finnish, and Polish.&lt;ref&gt;For specifics of the editions, see WorldCat: German: OCLC 657001222; Russian: OCLC 11042488; Yiddish: OCLC 145440240; Finnish: 8527848; Polish: OCLC 33412186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Hillquit attended the [[International Socialist Congress, Amsterdam 1904|International Socialist Congress]] at Amsterdam and was involved with the proposed Anti-Immigration Resolution, which opposed any legislation that forbade or hindered the immigration of foreign workingmen, some forced by misery to migrate. The resolution read: {{Quote|In further consideration of the fact that WORKINGMEN OF BACKWARD RACES (CHINESE, NEGROES, ETC.) are often imported by capitalists in order to keep down the native workingmen by means of cheap labor, and that his cheap labor, which constitutes a willing object for exploitation, live in an ill-concealed state of slavery, — the Congress declares that the Social Democracy is bound to combat with all its energy the application of this means, which serves to destroy the organizations of Labor, and thereby to hamper the progress and the eventual realization of Socialism. |author=Daniel De Leon |&lt;ref&gt;((cite web|last1=De Leon|first1=Daniel|title=Flashlights of the Amsterdam Congress|url=https://archive.org/details/FlashlightsOfTheAmsterdamCongress|website=Internet Archive|publisher=New York Labor News Company|accessdate=13 May 2017))&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hillquit ran for [[US Congress]] on the Socialist ticket in the New York 9th Congressional District in 1906 and 1908.&lt;ref&gt;F. Gerald Ham with Carole Sue Warmbrodt (eds.), ''The Morris Hillquit Papers: Guide to a Microfilm Edition.'' Madison, WI: State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1969; pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter campaign, Hillquit garnered 21.23% of the vote in a losing effort against a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle with syndicalist left wing==

After the campaign, Hillquit turned his attention to inner-party affairs, which brought him into conflict with the SPA's [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] Left Wing. His biographer notes at least four serious points of departure between Hillquit and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] wing of the party: a disbelief in the stability and the efficacy of industrial unions, a distaste for the strike-oriented tactics of the IWW as opposed to collective bargaining, a belief in the separation of functions between the political and labor wings of the workers' movement, as opposed to the IWW's desire to make industrial organization primary, and the [[political radicalism|radical]] tone of IWW propaganda, which Hillquit believed alienated much of society from the socialist movement and marginalized the left.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; His biographer declares:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"His leadership fanned the fires of Party disagreement and although [Hillquit] was not alone in causing the break in 1913 with an important segment of its left wing, he certainly made a major contribution towards this unfortunate rupture."&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1911, IWW leader [[Bill Haywood|William "Big Bill" Haywood]] was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, on which Hillquit also served. The syndicalist and the electoral socialist squared off in a lively public debate in New York City's Cooper Union on Jan. 11, 1912. Haywood declared that Hillquit and the socialists ought to try "a little sabotage in the right place at the proper time" and attacked Hillquit for having abandoned the class struggle by helping the New York garment workers negotiate an industrial agreement with their employers. Hillquit replied that he had no new message rather than to reiterate a belief in a two-sided workers movement, with separate and equal political and trade union arms. "A mere change of structural forms would not revolutionize the American labor movement as claimed by our extreme industrialists," he declared.&lt;ref&gt;Hillquit, "What shall the Attitude of the SP Be Toward the Economic Organization of the Workers?" (Haywood Debate) in Hillquit Papers; quoted in Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hillquit's battle against the syndicalist left of the party continued at the 1912 National Convention, held in May in Indianapolis. Hillquit's biographer notes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As chairman of the Committee on Constitution he more than likely authored the amendment to the Party's Article II, Section 6, which provided for the expulsion from the Party of 'any member of the party who opposes political action or advocates crime, sabotage, or other methods of violence as a weapon of the working class to aid in its emancipation&amp;nbsp;...'" He voiced his justification for the anti-sabotage amendment by reassuring the convention that 'if there is one thing in this country that can now check or disrupt the Socialist movement, it is not the capitalist class; it is not the Catholic Church; it is our own injudicious friends from within.'"&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The issue of "syndicalism vs. socialism" was bitterly fought over the next two years, consummated by "Big Bill" Haywood's recall from the SP's NEC and the departure of a broad section of the left wing from the organization. The radical wing never forgave Hillquit for his anti-IWW orientation and made him a major whipping boy in the big split that was to come.

==War years==
As a staunch [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] and [[antimilitarism|antimilitarist]], Hillquit represented the ideological center of the Socialist Party during the years of [[World War I]], which controlled the organization in coalition with the more pragmatist right wing exemplified by such locally oriented leaders, politicians, and journalists as [[Victor Berger]], [[Daniel Hoan]], [[John Spargo]], and [[Charles Edward Russell]]. He was elected to the SP's governing National Executive Committee on multiple occasions and was a frequent speaker at national conventions of the party. Due to his foreign birth, however, Hillquit was not constitutionally eligible to serve as [[President]] or [[Vice President]] of the United States and was thus never a candidate of the party for national office.

Hillquit was a principal co-author of the resolution against the [[World War I#Entry of the United States|US' entry into World War I]], which was passed overwhelmingly both by an emergency Socialist Party convention held just after the April 6th, 1917 declaration of war and by a subsequent membership vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workers.org/marcy/cd/sambol/bolwar/bolwar15.htm War proclamation and program adopted at the National Convention of the Socialist Party of the United States, St. Louis, Mo., April 1917] accessed June 18, 2008. Available in print as "St. Louis Manifesto of the Socialist Party 1917" in ''Socialism in America from the Shakers to the Third International: a documentary history'', edited by Albert Fried, New York: [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] Anchor edition, 1970; page 521. See also chapters IV and V of David Shannon's ''Socialist Party of America'', especially pages 93–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite official repression, popular patriotic pressure and vigilante action against the SP of A's organization, members and press, Hillquit never wavered on the issue of intervention, staunchly backing Debs, Berger, [[Kate Richards O'Hare]] and other socialists charged under the [[Espionage Act]] for opposing the war effort.

[[Image:Maurer-hillquit-london-1916.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Jim Maurer, Morris Hillquit, and Meyer London after their Jan. 1916 meeting with Woodrow Wilson]]
On January 26, 1916, Hillquit was part of a three-person delegation to [[Woodrow Wilson]] to advocate part of the Socialist Party's peace program, which proposed that "the President of the United States convoke a congress of neutral nations, which shall offer mediation to the belligerents and remain in permanent session until the termination of the war." A resolution had been offered in the House of Representatives by the party's lone representative, [[Meyer London]] of New York, and Wilson received Hillquit, London, and socialist trade unionist [[James H. Maurer]] at the [[White House]], along with various other delegations. Hillquit later recalled that Wilson was at first "inclined to give us a short and perfunctory hearing" but as the Socialists made their case to him, the session "developed into a serious and confidential conversation." Wilson told the group that he had already considered a similar plan but chose not to put it into effect because he was not sure of its reception by other neutral nations. "The fact is," Wilson claimed, "that the United States is the only important country that may be said to be neutral and disinterested. Practically all other neutral countries are in one way or another tied up with some belligerent power and dependent on it."&lt;ref&gt;Hillquit, ''Loose Leaves from a Busy Life,'' pg. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in June 1917, Hillquit served as chief defense lawyer in a series of high-profile cases on behalf of various socialist magazines and newspapers. The Wilson administration, headed in the matter by [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[Albert Burleson]], began to systematically ban specific issues or entire publications from the mail, or to force publications into financial peril by denying them access to low cost periodical rates. Hillquit argued cases on behalf of a number of important radical publications, including [[Max Eastman|Max Eastman's]] radical artistic and literary magazine, ''[[The Masses]];'' the two socialist dailies — the ''[[New York Call]]'' and the ''[[Milwaukee Leader]];'' the SP's official weekly, ''The American Socialist;'' the popular monthly ''[[Pearson's Magazine]];'' and the Yiddish language ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]].'' In each case, Hillquit argued that the socialist press was truly "American" and that a socialist definition of "patriotism" included the freedoms of press and speech and the right to criticize in a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Hillquit was unsuccessful in winning access to the mails for the papers he represented, but he did manage to keep the proprietors of ''The Masses'' out of prison.

==First mayoral campaign==
In the summer of 1917, with nationalism and pro-war sentiment sweeping the nation, Hillquit [[New York City mayoral election, 1917|ran for Mayor of New York City]]. Hillquit's campaign was based on an anti-war platform and commitment to economical public services and drew the diverse support both of committed socialists, pacifists and other anti-war activists, and pro-war liberals endorsing his campaign as a protest against the government's "sedition" policy, which effectively served to curb freedoms of speech and press.&lt;ref name="Pratt, p. 129"&gt;Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit,'' p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Hillquit seems to have been largely immune from attack by the Socialist Party's left wing or other radicals during the high-profile campaign,&lt;ref name="Pratt, p. 129"/&gt; which ended with Hillquit collecting an impressive 22% of the citywide vote. That campaign, combined with the ongoing electoral success of Congressman [[Meyer London]] (elected as a Socialist in 1914, 1916, and 1920) marked the high point for Socialist Party politics in New York City.

As a member of the SP's National Executive Committee Hillquit worked closely with National Secretary [[Adolph Germer]] and [[James Oneal]] to defend the party from what in modern parlance might be described as an "unfriendly takeover" by its [[revolutionary socialist]] left wing. However, due to ill health Hillquit did not participate in the pivotal [[1919 Emergency National Convention]] at Chicago, which formalized the split of the left wing from the Socialist Party to form the [[Communist Labor Party of America]] and the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of America]]. Instead, Hillquit was ensconced in a sanitorium in upstate New York, recovering from another bout of [[tuberculosis]], and was informed about the events of the convention after the fact.

==Later career==
[[File:Hillquit-Morris-240725.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Morris Hillquit in July 1924.]]
In 1920 Hillquit served as the lead attorney in the unsuccessful defense of the five democratically elected Socialist assemblymen expelled from the [[New York State Assembly]]. Hillquit's efforts to see Assemblymen [[Samuel Orr|Orr]], [[August Claessens|Claessens]], [[Louis Waldman|Waldman]], [[Sam Dewitt|DeWitt]], and [[Charles Solomon (politician)|Solomon]] restored to office was ultimately unsuccessful.

From 1922 through the election of 1924, Hillquit was a leading advocate of Socialist Party participation in the [[Conference for Progressive Political Action]] (CPPA).

As a celebrated leader of American Marxism and [[Jewish assimilation|acculturated]] Jew, Hillquit never became closely associated with the specifically Jewish [[Jewish left|left wing]], but he played a role in the Jewish trade union movement, being for a time the lawyer of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union|ILGWU]]. He also never became a Jewish nationalist of any kind; quite the contrary, he was ideologically disposed against it, but in 1926 he confessed, "[[Zionism]] makes a strong emotional appeal to me, chiefly as a manifestation of awakening national self respect of the Jewish people." He quickly added however that Zionism, like all other national movements, must guard itself against the dangers of degeneration into [[jingoism]]—"If it ever developed in that direction, it will forfeit all claims to Socialist sympathy."&lt;ref&gt;Ezra Mendelsohn, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=g72diKsztnQC&amp;pg=PA90 On Modern Jewish Politics]'', p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, shortly before his death from tuberculosis, Hillquit received over one-eighth of the vote in [[New York City mayoral elections#1932|his second campaign]] for Mayor of New York City. That proved to be Hillquit's final electoral run; during his life, he had been twice a candidate for [[Mayor of New York City]] and on five times a nominee for [[United States Congress|Congress]].

==Death==
He died of tuberculosis "a few minutes past midnight on October 8th" of 1933.&lt;ref&gt;"Millions Mourn Hillquit: World-Famous Socialist Leader Dies After Long Illness," ''The New Leader,'' vol. 16, no. 16 (Oct. 14, 1932), pg. 1. As ''The New Leader'' was the newspaper of record of the American Socialist movement in 1933, that should be regarded as precise. However, that some sources have Hillquit's date of death as "October 7, 1933."&lt;/ref&gt; He was 64 years old at the time of his death.

==Legacy==

Hillquit was first and foremost an orator, delivering a torrent of public talks on socialist themes to various audiences throughout his life. In his memoirs, Hillquit conservatively estimates the total number of such speeches to have been "at least 2,000."&lt;ref&gt;Hillquit, ''Loose Leaves from a Busy Life,'' p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; He often appeared in public debates taking up the socialist banner. He wrote frequently for popular magazines and the party press but fairly infrequently for publication in leaflet or pamphlet form.

Despite the fact that Hillquit was not a prolific pamphleteer, he did author of a number of substantial books, including a serious academic history of socialism, ''History of Socialism in the United States'' (1903, revised 1910 — translated into both Russian and German); works of popularization, such as ''Socialism in Theory and Practice'' (1909) and ''Socialism Summed Up'' (1912); a short theoretical piece, ''From Marx to Lenin'' (1921); as well as a posthumously published memoir, ''Loose Leaves from a Busy Life'' (1934).

Hillquit's papers are housed at the [[State Historical Society of Wisconsin]] at [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] and are available on microfilm.

One of the buildings of the [[East River Housing Corporation]], a [[housing cooperative]] started by the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] in [[Cooperative Village]] on the Lower East Side, was named in Hillquit's honor.

The '''National Union for Independence''' ({{lang-fr|Union nationale pour l'indépendance}}, UNI) is a [[militant]] [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Secession|pro-independence]] alliance of [[political parties]] in [[New Caledonia]]. It is a component of the [[Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front]] (FLNKS) along with the [[Caledonian Union]].

==Components==

The term UNI has now been changed to include a broad coalition of:

*[[Party of Kanak Liberation]] (Palika) 
*[[Melanesian Progressive Union]] (UPM)
*[[Oceanian Democratic Rally]] (RDO)
*[[Renewed Caledonian Union]] (UC-R) in the [[Loyalty Islands]]

The Palika is by far the largest of the four parties.

==History==

The term UNI was first applied in 1995 to refers to a dissident list from the FLNKS led by [[Paul Néaoutyine]] in the [[North Province, New Caledonia|North Province]]. Since then, the term UNI refers to the broad coalition led by the Palika in various provincial elections since then.

In the [[New Caledonian legislative election, 2009|2009 provincial elections]], the party won 10 seats (of which 8 went to the Palika, the other two to the UC-R and RDO respectively) in the [[Congress of New Caledonia]] and around 6.87% of the vote. However, in the [[South Province, New Caledonia|South Province]], the UNI ran on a common slate with the [[Caledonian Union]] and won three of the four seats won by that list (the Palika won one, the UPM won one, and the RDO won one).

'''Nauvoo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɔː|v|uː}}; etymology: {{Hebrew Name|נָאווּ|Navu|Nâwû|“they are beautiful”}}) is a small city in [[Hancock County, Illinois|Hancock County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]], on the [[Mississippi River]] near [[Fort Madison, Iowa]]. The population of Nauvoo was 1,149 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Nauvoo attracts visitors for its historic importance and its religious significance to members of several groups: [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church); the [[Community of Christ]], formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS); other groups stemming from the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]; and the [[Icarians]]. The city and its immediate surrounding area are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Nauvoo Historic District]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo Historic District}}
The area of Nauvoo was first called '''Quashquema''', named in honor of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] chief who headed a [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Fox people|Fox]] settlement numbering nearly 500 lodges. By 1827, white settlers had built cabins in the area. By 1829 this area of Hancock County had grown sufficiently so that a post office was needed and in 1832 the town, now called '''Venus''',  was one of the contenders for the new county seat. However, the honor was awarded to a nearby city, [[Carthage, Illinois|Carthage]]. In 1834 the name Venus was changed to '''Commerce''' because the settlers felt that the new name better suited their plans.

In late 1839, arriving [[Mormons]] bought the small town of Commerce and in April 1840 it was renamed '''Nauvoo'''&lt;ref&gt;Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois and History of Hancock County, Vol. II, Munsell Publishing Company, Chicago, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Joseph Smith]], who led the Latter Day Saints to Nauvoo to escape [[1838 Mormon War|conflict with the state government]] in Missouri. The name Nauvoo is derived from the traditional [[Hebrew language]] with an [[anglicization|anglicized]] spelling. The word comes from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 52:7, “How beautiful upon the mountains...” It is notable that “by 1844 Nauvoo's population had swollen to 12,000, rivaling the size of Chicago” at the time.&lt;ref&gt;"American Experience: The Mormon's". Act 3 - Persecution; Chapter 5. PBS Documentary. (2006) DVD, 240 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hoyt|first=Homer|title=One Hundred Years of Land Values in Chicago|year=1933|publisher=University of Chicago|isbn=1-58798-016-9|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nauvoo3b24766u.jpg|thumb|250px|Engraving of Nauvoo, ca. 1855]]
After [[Death of Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith's death]] in 1844, continued violence from surrounding non-Mormons forced most Latter-Day Saints to leave Nauvoo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mormons-begin-exodus-to-utah|title=Mormons begin exodus to Utah - Feb 10, 1846 - HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Most of these followers, led by [[Brigham Young]], emigrated to the [[Salt Lake Valley|Great Salt Lake Valley]]. In 1849, [[Icarians]] moved to the Nauvoo area to implement a [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] based on the ideals of [[France|French]] philosopher [[Étienne Cabet]]. The colony had over 500 members at its peak, but Cabet's death in 1856 led some members to leave this parent colony. In the early and mid 20th century Nauvoo was primarily a [[Roman Catholic]] town, and a plurality of the population today is [[Methodist]] or another Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bestplaces.net/religion/city/illinois/nauvoo|title=Nauvoo, Illinois Religion|website=www.bestplaces.net|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nauvoo today===
On the city’s higher ground are the temple, residential areas, and the business district along Mulholland Street (Illinois Route 96), much of it devoted to the needs of tourists and those interested in [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint]] history. The flatlands are occupied by a small number of 19th-century brick houses and other buildings that have survived the city’s vicissitudes, with large empty spaces between them where houses and whole neighborhoods have disappeared.

[[Community of Christ]] owns much of the southern end of the flatlands and maintains several key historic sites in and around Nauvoo, including the Joseph Smith Homestead, the [[Nauvoo House]], the [[Red Brick Store]], the [[Joseph Smith Mansion House|Mansion House]], and the [[Smith Family Cemetery]]. Guided tours are available at the church's Joseph Smith Historic Site, at the south end of the town and accessible from Highway 96.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints owns most of the other historic sites in Nauvoo, including the homes of [[Brigham Young]], [[Heber C. Kimball]], and other early members of the church, as well as other significant buildings. Most of these sites are open to the public, with demonstrations and displays, and there are self-guided driving tours as well as wagon tours. These tours are free, as are the stage and riverside theatrical productions. There is a large visitors' center complete with two theaters and a relief map of 1846 Nauvoo.

The creation of Nauvoo as a historical tourism destination was largely a result of the work of J. LeRoy Kimball (1901-1992).  Kimball was a descendent of early Mormon leader Heber C. Kimball, and bought his ancestor's home in 1954 with the intention of restoring it.&lt;ref&gt;Janath R. Cannon, ''Nauvoo Panorama: Views of Nauvoo before, during and after its rise, fall, and restoration'' (Nauvoo: Nauvoo Restoration, Inc, 1991), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the president of Nauvoo Restoration, Inc. from 1962 to 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/254347/DEATH--J-LEROY-KIMBALL-MD.html?pg=all|title=DEATH:  J. LEROY KIMBALL, M.D.|date=20 October 1992|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927003524/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/254347/DEATH--J-LEROY-KIMBALL-MD.html?pg=all|archivedate=27 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Q. Cannon, "Nauvoo", in ''Encyclopedia of LDS Church History'', p. 823&lt;/ref&gt;

A Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' congregation was established in Nauvoo in 1956, from its inception consisting largely of elderly LDS couples serving as missionaries and historical guides.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, ''Nauvoo Panorama'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''City of Joseph'' Pageant, an outdoor musical produced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, began to run each summer in 1976.  A [Stake (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) was organized with headquarters at Nauvoo in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, ''Nauvoo Panorama'', p. 86-97&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the many homes that had been restored, the Relief Society Memorial Garden was dedicated in 1978, featuring statues designed by [[Dennis Smith (sculptor)|Dennis Smith]] and Florence Hansen.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, ''Nauvoo Panorama'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2002, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints completed construction of a new [[Nauvoo Illinois Temple|temple]] on the site of the original temple. The exterior, and much of the interior, is a copy of the original. The exterior matches the original exactly except in three ways: The temple was positioned {{convert|12.5|ft|m}} south to allow for parking on the north side, there are two new exterior doors (with an entrance on the north for disabled persons and emergency exits in the basement on the east) and there is a standing [[Angel Moroni]] as is seen on most modern temples; the original was an unspecified flying angel, also with a horn in hand but in a horizontal position with the compass, square and flame above.&lt;ref&gt;Perrigrine Sessions Journal, 30 January 1846, Church Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebuilding of the Nauvoo Temple was an occasion of great joy and enthusiasm for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. During the public open house prior to its dedication, 331,849 visitors toured the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/nauvoo|title=Nauvoo Illinois Temple|accessdate=2013-05-28|publisher=Rick Satterfield|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615131121/http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/nauvoo/|archivedate=2013-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following 
Church custom, the temple is now used only by Church members.

In comparison to other towns in the area, Nauvoo has seen consistent population growth since the completion of the temple&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-27|title=Hancock County, Illinois|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hancock_County,_Illinois&amp;oldid=832699977|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.[[File:Nauvoo flooding 2008.jpg|200px|thumb|Nauvoo House during 2008 Flood]]

The work to renovate various sites of historical significance in the area is coordinated by ''Nauvoo Restoration, Incorporated''. NRI is a nonprofit organization supported by the LDS Church and Community of Christ, as well as others interested in Nauvoo’s history. Due to the work of NRI and its members, Nauvoo has been dubbed the “[[Colonial Williamsburg|Williamsburg]] of the Midwest.” In March 2007, Nauvoo was nominated to compete as one of the Seven Wonders of Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070208185101/http://www.enjoyillinois.com/sevenwonders/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints at Nauvoo sponsors numerous activities throughout the year including The Nauvoo Pageant (July/August), Grape Festival (Labor day weekend), and Pumpkin walk (October).

Because most of the city is well above flood level, Nauvoo has not historically had problems when the Mississippi river has risen. In both the floods of 1993 and 2008, very little damage was sustained within city limits.

Nauvoo has many places of worship, among them: United Methodist Church, Christ Lutheran Church, St Peter &amp; Paul Catholic Church, Nauvoo Baptist Church, a Community of Christ congregation, and various [[Ward (LDS Church)|Wards]] of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;ei=tTWeSsaIGIvWtgOL2qEX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=nauvoo%20illinois%20churches&amp;spell=1&amp;fp=9b1c6ebfff7f9103|title=Google|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050720082857/http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;ei=tTWeSsaIGIvWtgOL2qEX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=nauvoo%20illinois%20churches&amp;spell=1&amp;fp=9b1c6ebfff7f9103|archivedate=20 July 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Nauvoo is at {{Coord|40|33|N|91|22|W|type:city}} (40.5446, -91.3803).&lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6665BhgnH?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archivedate=2012-03-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated on a wide bend in the [[Mississippi River]], Nauvoo has most of the historic district in the lower flat lands (called the ''flats'') that are no more than a few feet above the water line. A prominent hill rises as one moves further east, at the apex of which stands the [[Nauvoo Illinois Temple|rebuilt Nauvoo Temple]]. Beginning with the temple, this elevated land (called the ''uptown'') continues flat for many miles eastward.

According to the 2010 census, Nauvoo has a total area of {{convert|4.831|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|3.39|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 70.17%) is land and {{convert|1.441|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 29.83%) is water.&lt;ref name="census-g001"&gt;{{cite web

==Economy==
The Nauvoo Blue Cheese company began to produce [[cheese]] in the 1930s. It was discovered that the cool, moist [[wine cellar]]s in the area were ideal for aging cheese. The wine cellars, and the [[wine]]-making business originally started by the [[Icarians]], saw a decline in use because of [[prohibition]]. In 2003 the Nauvoo Cheese company went out of business when [[Saputo Incorporated|Saputo]] food company purchased it and relocated to other facilities.

Nauvoo is also home to Baxter's Vineyards, a small family-owned [[winery]] begun in 1857 by Emile Baxter that is it Illinois' oldest established [[winery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070823230654/http://www.nauvoowinery.com/baxter_history.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030911170902/http://www.enjoyillinois.com/wine/wine_country.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beautifulnauvoo.com/ |title=Nauvoo Tourism office - Visitor information |website=Beautifulnauvoo.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927051513/http://www.beautifulnauvoo.com/ |archivedate=2016-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism is the major industry in Nauvoo, with Nauvoo Restoration Inc., employing approximately 30, while an estimated 200 LDS missionaries (unpaid) also provide a boost to local businesses during the tourist season.

Due to lack of sustainable industries, the city has lost several key businesses and services including the High School and multiple small businesses. In October 2018, a [[Dollar General]] opened in Nauvoo.

==Government and politics==
Nauvoo City government consists of the Mayor, six aldermen (two from each ward), and City Treasurer. Additionally, there are appointed positions for City Clerk, Marshall, and Public Works positions.
As of 2007, the mayor is John McCarty. The aldermen are Tom Adams, Clive Moon, Bev Reynolds, Jim Boyles, Dave Koechle, and Lee Ourth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080830020432/http://www.cityofnauvoo.org/city_hall/city_council_members/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate from the city are the Nauvoo Fire Protection District (FPD) and Nauvoo-Colusa School System. The Nauvoo FPD covers all of the city plus the surrounding five townships. The fire department currently provides both fire and EMS coverage for its district. In 1991 the Nauvoo FPD became a [[Basic life support|BLS]] non-transporting agency, relying on the county ambulance service to transport patients to local hospitals. Because of longer response times from county-run ambulances, the citizens of the Nauvoo FPD passed a referendum by 74% on April 17, 2007, for ambulance services that would transfer the ambulance tax money to the FPD that was being paid to the county. The Nauvoo FPD completed its fundraising efforts on November 30, 2007, to purchase its ambulance, which entered service in January 2008.

==Education==
The [[Nauvoo-Colusa Community Unit School District 325]] runs the local elementary and middle school.

Prior to 2008 residents attended [[Nauvoo-Colusa High School]]. Since 2008 residents have attended [[Warsaw Community Unit School District 316]]'s [[Warsaw High School (Illinois)|Warsaw High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalpilot.com/news/article_f41ca0cf-391a-5de8-b06a-b6370d6ec065.html|author=Vance, Diane (MVM News Network)|title=Voters approve Warsaw/Nauvoo-Colusa deactivation plans|publisher=''[[Hancock County Journal-Pilot]]''|date=2008-02-12|accessdate=2017-03-29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603020654/http://www.journalpilot.com/news/article_f41ca0cf-391a-5de8-b06a-b6370d6ec065.html|archivedate=2017-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
{{main article|Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist)}}
The uprising occurred in such a situation that a great turmoil was going on with in the communist organisations of the world and also the Indian nation following the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. The leader and ideologue of the uprising [[Charu Majumdar]] presumed that the time was ripe for launching an armed [[People's war|protracted people's war]] in India following the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)]], [[Vietnam War]] and [[Cuban Revolution]]. Charu majumdar wrote the [[Historic Eight Documents]] which became the foundation of the naxalite movement in 1967.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/naxalite-ideology-charu-s-eight-documents/story-hiCWDlzyc5yNRgYkBMX1qL.html|title=Naxalite Ideology: Charu's Eight Documents|author=Nadeem Ahmed|last=|first=|date=|work=The Hindustan Times|via=|accessdate=|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221162344/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/naxalite-ideology-charu-s-eight-documents/story-hiCWDlzyc5yNRgYkBMX1qL.html|archive-date=2016-12-21|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline ==
The communists in 1965-66 already had gained grounds in the Naxalbari region. The so-called "siliguri group" launched the uprising by giving the call for initiation of armed struggle. Many peasant cells were created throughout the region. On March 3, 1967, some peasants seized a plot of land in the region and started harvesting crops. By 18 March the peasants started seizing land from [[jotedars]] (landlords) landowners who owned large plots of land in the region were called jotedars).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Peasant committees were set up throughout the region within four months. The first clash occurred between the peasants and landlords when a share-cropper Bigul Kisan was beaten up by landlord gentries. Following this violent clashes occurred when the peasant committees seized land, foodgrains and arms from the landlord gentries. The government started mobilizing police officers.The inspector of Jharugaon village was killed by peasant committee members. In retaliation the police open fired killing nine women and one child on 25 May 1967.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; By June the peasant committees gained hold in the regions around Naxalbari, Kharibari and Phansidewa seizing lands, ammunition and food grains from the jotedars. The tea garden works around Darjeeling region participated in strikes supprting the peasant committees. The upheaval sustained till July 19 when the paramilitary forces were sent by the government. Leaders like [[Jangal Santhal]] were arrested. Some of them like [[Charu Majumdar]] went underground. And others like Tribheni Kanu, Sobham, Ali Gorkha Majhi, and Tilka Majhi were killed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Recognition and aftermath ==
The uprising got moral support from the communists of Nepal and China&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/peoples-daily/1967/07/05.htm|title=Spring Thunder Over India|accessdate=2016-12-21|author=|date=|last=|first=|publisher=[[marxists.org]]|language=en|website=[[People's Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; simultaneously deteriorating the relation of the later with the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]. The CPI(M) expelled many of its members who supported the uprising. [[Charu Majumdar]], [[Souren Bose]], [[Mahadeb Mukherjee]] and [[Dilip Bagchi]] were expelled on the same day. Expelled communists later on organised themselves into one organisation ('''AICCCR''') further developing into the CPI(ML). CPI(ML) remained the centre of the naxalite movement till 1975. A large number of enthusiastic youth joined the movement. Although the uprising was suppressed but it remained a landmark of the India polity which further lead to several other similar kind of movements in parts of Bihar (see [[Lal Sena]]) and the [[Naxalite–Maoist insurgency]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Chief Minister, 2004 - 2006==
The results of the parliamentary elections in May 2004 saw the Indian National Congress not winning a single seat in Kerala. The sitting Chief Minister, [[A.K. Antony]], was forced to resign and accept responsibility for the poor results. On 30 August 2004, Chandy was elected the Congress Legislature Party leader at the end of a meeting by AICC observers and clearance by the Congress president, [[Sonia Gandhi]]. In what may be seen as a reflection of his work as Chief Minister, the Congress-led alliance was defeated, but managed to retain 40 out of 140 seats in the assembly and boost its vote-share by nearly 10% after the general election rout. He resigned as Chief Minister on 12 May 2006 following the defeat of his party in [[Kerala state assembly election, 2006|2006 Assembly Elections]].

==Leader of Opposition==
Oommen Chandy was the leader of opposition in the twelfth Kerala Legislative Assembly. Under his leadership UDF marked victories in Lok Sabha Election 2009, gaining 16 out of 20 parliament constituencies in Kerala,  and Local Body Election 2010. In the history of Kerala politics it's the first time that the UDF got an upper hand in local body elections.

==Leader of Congress Parliamentary Party==
After winning the closely contested 2011 assembly election, Congress legislative party unanimously elected Oommen Chandy as its leader. At the Congress Legislature Party meeting, Chandy's name was proposed by, Ramesh Chennithala and seconded by Aryadan Mohammed. The election process was formally launched after Congress Working Committee (CWC) member Mohsina Kidwai and AICC general secretary [[Madhusudan Mistry]], who is in charge of Kerala, held a one-to-one meeting in their capacity as observers with the 38 elected MLAs.

==Second term as Chief Minister, 2011-2016==
[[File:Kerala CM Oomen Chandy calls meets PM Modi on 3 June 2014.jpg|thumb|Kerala CM Oommen Chandy with Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]]]]

UDF (United Democratic Front) led by Oommen Chandy secured a slender margin in assembly election which held on 13 April 2011. UDF candidates won in 72 seats against 68 seats of LDF (Left Democratic Front). He took the oath on 18 May 2011 with six other ministers of his cabinet. Later thirteen other ministers were also inducted into his cabinet.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

He gave up Vigilance Portfolio in early August 2011, after a fresh probe was ordered on the [[Palmolein Oil Import Scam|Palmolein oil case]], which happened when he was Finance Minister in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/chandy-gives-up-vigilance-portfolio/article2340389.ece "Chandy gives up Vigilance portfolio"], "The Hindu", August 09, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar scam===
In June 2013, Chandy's personal assistant was arrested for an alleged involvement in the [[2013 Kerala solar panel scam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/solar-panel-scam-tenny-joppan-remanded-to-judicial-custody/article4863120.ece "Solar panel scam: Tenny Joppan remanded to judicial custody"], "The Hindu", June 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. Opposition parties subsequently demanded Chandy's resignation until the United Democratic Front (UDF) government ordered a judicial inquiry into the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ldf-calls-off-secretariat-siege/article5018538.ece "LDF calls off Secretariat siege "], "The Hindu", August 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Awards and honours==
Oommen Chandy received the 2013 [[United Nations Public Service Awards|United Nations Public Service Award]]&lt;ref name="ChandyUNTheHindu"&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/chandy-to-get-un-award-tomorrow/article4850295.ece "Chandy wins UN Award"] The Hindu, Thiruvananthapuram, 26 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChandyUNPAN"&gt;[http://unpan.org/DPADM/UNPSDayAwards/UNPublicServiceAwards/tabid/1522/language/en-US/Default.aspx "UN Public Administration Programme"] UN Public Administration Programme.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChandyUNEcoTimes"&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-05-22/news/39445317_1_mass-contact-programme-chandy-3-lakh "Chandy Wins UN Award"] The Economic Times.&lt;/ref&gt; from the Asia-Pacific region, for the category "Preventing and Combating Corruption in the Public Service."

'''Oscar Oiwa''' (in {{lang-ja|大岩オスカール}}) is a [[Brazil]]ian-[[American people|American]] painter.

==Biography==

Oiwa was born in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, son of Japanese immigrants. He received his B.F.A. (1989) from the School of Architecture and Urbanism, [[São Paulo University]]. Oiwa was influenced by comic books, art, and magazines throughout his youth, as well as the urban environment of his birthplace. He experienced contemporary art during this time in nearby galleries and became an assistant at the [[São Paulo Art Biennial]].  Oiwa held his first solo exhibition while he was still in college and thereafter participated in the 21st [[São Paulo Art Biennial]] (1991).

He currently lives and works in [[New York City]], though his artwork has been exhibited worldwide.  He has had over 60 solo exhibitions since 1990, including Arizona State University Art Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo, Fukushima Prefectural Museum of Art, Takamatsu City Museum and Museu Nacional de Belas Artes in Rio de Janeiro.

Selected public collections: The National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo (Tokyo), Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo (Tokyo), Mori Art Museum (Tokyo), Yokohama Museum of Art (Kanagawa), Toyota Municipal Museum(Aichi), Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art(Hiroshima), Hyogo Prefectural Museum of Art(Hyogo), 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa(Ishikawa), Utsunomiya Museum of Art (Tochigi), Phoenix Museum of Art(Arizona), Arizona State University Art Museum (Arizona), Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, University of São Paulo Museum of Contemporary Art (USP).

Represented Gallery: Art Front Gallery (Tokyo), Tokyo Gallery+BTAP (Tokyo, Beijing), Gallery Caption (Gifu), Keumsan Gallery(Seoul), Connoisseur Contemporary (Hong Kong). He has received several awards including Pollock-Krasner Foundation grants, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2001) and Asian Cultural Council in 2002.

==Globalism==
Born in [[São Paulo]] in 1965, Oiwa relocated to Tokyo in 1991 after graduating from the university. After ten years in Japan, interrupted by a year spent in London, he moved to New York in 2002 and has since made that city his base of operations. His decision both times to relocate to another country was motivated by a desire to expand his activities as an artist, he says. At this suggests, Oiwa has always been a self-motivating artist, sure of his needs, when it comes to his movements. Among 20 years of art production starting from São Paulo days, Oiwa’s oeuvre includes everything from texts, paintings, and art objects to fictional narrative-based installations, conceptual works patterned after kits, public art, and book production.
&lt;ref&gt;Chinzei, Yoshimi (2008). ''Oscar Oiwa: The Dreams of a Sleeping World'' exhibition catalogue, p. 80, Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oiwa's works present us with a world closely familiar and yet completely unexpected. As is often said, it is a world constructed of dissimilar or opposing elements that, although starkly different, coexist. Behind the interest Oiwa's works give to people is the breadth of vision with which he connects these innumerable elements - their amplitude, in other words.
&lt;ref&gt;Chinzei, Yoshimi(2008). ''Oscar Oiwa: Painting in the Age of Globalization'', Gendaikikakushitsu Publishers, Tokyo. {{ISBN|978-4-7738-0801-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coexistence of naturalist representation and the fabled-fantastic datum is one of the typical aspects of Oiwa’s paintings – one that approximates his production to Brazilian and Latin American literary tradition, of so-called [[magic realism]]. The realm of authors such [[Jorge Amado]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], [[Isabel Allende]] or [[Gabriel García Marquez]], to mention only a few among the most celebrated, is characterized by a similar oscillation, that is to say, by the coexistence of meticulously naturalist descriptions, often deeply engaged from the social political standpoint, and passages of fantastic literature, replete with ghosts, miracles, and metamorphoses.  Here, the possible and the impossible seem to live in harmony; the absurd and the inexplicable become plausible, and the fabulous become natural and even expected, exactly like in Oiwa's pictures. The joyful and yet menacing giant flowers that hover over New York in ''Gardening (Manhattan)'' (2002), or the black snow that falls over São Paulo in ''Black Snow ''(1997) are majestic, biblical events comparable to the insomnia and amnesia that afflict the inhabitants of Macondo in García Marquez’s ''One Hundred Years of Solitude''; or, even more tangible, to thousands of notes scribbled with names of all things, that they post everywhere in their desperate attempt to halt memory loss.

The kinship of Oiwa’s painting with a typically Latin American literary genre should not suggest  a reductionist or regionalist reading of his oeuvre. On the contrary, among the Brazilian artists of his generation, Oscar Oiwa is certainly one who most rapidly and effectively became independent from the local context, having lived the better part of his life and built his artistic career between  Europe, Japan, and the United States. Way beyond the [[Latin American]] context, the simultaneity of distinctive records in combination with the richness of sources and references attest to the globalized and postmodern character of Oiwa’s painting – provided we view him as an artist undergoing constant, contradictory and ironical transformation, permeable to the most diverse stimuli.
&lt;ref&gt;Visconti, Jacopo Crivelli (2009). ''Oiwa in Wonderland'', Thomas Cohn gallery exhibition catalogue, p. 13, São Paulo.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many art writers have called his work criticism of globalization, something that has also been called the cause of 9/11. Oiwa, however, says globalization is not entirely bad. In fact, this globe-trotting artist may be the epitome of globalization; his artwork as a look at the world simultaneously from the inside and out.
&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Cristoph (May 30, 2008), Daily Yomiuri, p. 14, Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever the ecumenical, Oiwa directs his wit to the broader political community. In ''G-8 Meeting'', 2007, he places mascots for the most powerful countries of the world in a garden setting. They seem to have arrived by yacht. The telltale Oiwa remind us of the way the rest of the world lives with a heap of rubble huddled in the lower-right corner. An elegant mansion suitable for such a summit meeting is in the background. Over all, a lovely pattern of snow dapples the sky in much the way that pattern works on [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] decorative screens. The players are gathered on the lawn to have a picnic, or divide the spoils. It is a union of cartoon superheroes. Italy is represented by Valentine, an [[anime]] babe wielding a camera as if it were a machine gun, her bandolier of film and gadgets across her bare breasts. Her boots in a camouflage pattern nearly reach the bottoms of her bikini panties. [[Asterix le Galois]], representing France, is dressed like an escape from Walkyrie. He toasts the representative from the United Kingdom, Wallace, who is eating. They have a bottle of champagne on ice. In the foreground, a demur [[Misha]], the bear from the Olympics, is Russia. Then there are the bodybuilders in leotards. Japan is represented by the special-effects film star Ultraman. The United States is [[Captain America]], with big American feet, and Germany hanging on for dear life. Looking like a cousin of the American, [[Captain Canuck]], in red and white, represents Canada. In the background, as obedient as a Zen monk, [[Mafalda]] is sweeping. The Argentine comic strip began in the 1960s features Mafalda, a six-year-old working-class Argentine girl who has strong opinions about contemporary politics. This idealist with a left-of-center point of view dreams of working as an interpreter for the United Nations when she grows up. Here instead of playing the role, she is consigned to cleaning up after the G-8. The lone representative from Latin America, she is not a guest but a servant.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, Marilyn A. (2008). ''War and (Uneasy) Peace'', Thomas Cohn gallery exhibition catalogue, São Paulo.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is not the first artist to record the impact of globalization but is among the most experienced of them not only for his skill as painter but for the complexity of his view of the transformations that have occurred as a result of unbridled extreme of human ambition. He reflects on the passive acceptance of change and the gradual deformation of the environment, especially of cities, the tight-knit, human-built megalopolis that refers to no specific city but instead suggest many. He does not simply scold and accuse. He shows us a world in which cultures fuse with some, overpowering and contaminating others. He makes scenic paintings about cultural collision, environmental degradation, dehumanizing slums, and violence through attrition.

Oiwa works in modules, each panel {{convert|abbr=on|227|xx|111|cm|ft}}. While living and working in Japan, he uses the dimensions of the traditional [[tatami]]: {{convert|abbr=on|91|xx|182|cm|ft}}. But when he moved to London in 1996, he translated this idea into English by opting for the size of the British sheet of [[plywood]]. He lines up the panels edge-to-edge, to make a painting from one to six panels. The system is not only convenient for shipping and storing, it takes advantage of the benefits of a grid, giving a sense of order against which Oiwa’s panoramic and often apocalyptic vision unfurls.

The '''Plan of Campaign''' was a [[strategy|stratagem]] adopted in Ireland between 1886 and 1891, co-ordinated by Irish politicians for the benefit of [[tenant farmer]]s, against mainly [[absentee landlord|absentee]] and [[rack-rent]] [[landlord]]s. It was launched to counter agricultural distress caused by the continual depression in prices of dairy products and cattle from the mid-1870s, which left many tenants in arrears with rent. Bad weather in 1885 and 1886 also caused crop failure, making it harder to pay rents. The [[Land War]] of the early 1880s was about to be renewed after [[eviction]]s increased and outrages became widespread.

==Drastic measures==
The Plan, conceived by [[Tim Healy (politician)|Timothy Healy]] was devised and organised by [[Timothy Harrington]] secretary of the [[Irish National League]], [[William O'Brien]] and [[John Dillon]]. It was outlined in an article headed ''Plan of Campaign'' by Harrington which was published on 23 October 1886 in the League's newspaper, the ''United Irishman'' of which O'Brien was editor. The purpose of the Plan was to secure a reduction of rent where tenants considered themselves overburdened in consequence of a poor harvest: if a landlord refused to accept a reduced rent, the tenants were to pay no rent at all. The rents were then collected by campaigners who banked them in the name of a National League committee of trustees and were to be used to assist evicted tenants who had risked eviction in the hope of rapid fair-rent reinstatement. 

A [[Land Commission]] had been established under the [[Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881]] to review and reduce rents where they were clearly unpayable, securing an average reduction of 25%. The Campaign sought to further reduce the amounts by concerted action, and ideally by negotiation.

The measures were to be put into operation on 203 estates, mainly in the south and west of the country though including some scattered Ulster estates. Initially sixty landlords accepted the reduced rents, twenty-four holding out but then agreeing the tenant conditions. Tenants gave in on fifteen estates. The chief trouble occurred on the remaining large estates. The organisers of the Plan decided to test a number of these expecting the remainder would then give in. Widespread attention was focused on it being implemented by Dillon and O'Brien on the estate of the [[Hubert de Burgh-Canning, 2nd Marquess of Clanricarde|Marquess of Clanricarde]] at [[Portumna]], [[County Galway]] (19 November 1886), where the landlord was an absentee [[Protestant Ascendancy|ascendancy landlord]].&lt;ref&gt;Clanricarde's family had owned their estates since the Middle Ages; see [[Clan Burke]].&lt;/ref&gt; The estate comprising {{convert|52000|acre|km2}}, or 21,000 hectare, yielded 25,000 sterling yearly in rents paid by 1,900 tenants. The hard-pressed tenants looked for a reduction of twenty-five percent. The landlord refused to give any abatement. The tenant's reduced rents were then placed into an estate fund, and the landlord informed he would only receive the monies when he agreed to the reduction. Tenants on other estate then followed the example of the Clanricarde tenants, the Plan on each estate led by a member of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] Campaign activists including [[Pat O'Brien (Irish politician)|Pat O'Brien]], [[Alexander Blane]] or members of its constituency organisation, the National League. Some 20,000 tenants were involved.

==Parnell's dilemma==
[[Charles Stewart Parnell]], leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, had been concentrating on winning over the British electorate to [[Irish Home Rule]] prior to the 1885 elections. [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], leader of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] then in power, had come under Parnell's sway and committed himself like a ferocious evangelist to introducing Home Rule as "justice for Ireland". The election in November saw Parnell with 86 seats holding the balance of power in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Gladstone then introduced the [[First Irish Home Rule Bill]] in April 1886. Immediately, [[Irish Unionist|Unionists]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] mounted opposition throughout Britain. Gladstone's party split on the issue, with his wealthier supporters forming the [[Liberal Unionist Party]]. On its second reading in June, the Bill was defeated by 341 seats to 311, and Parliament was dissolved. The ensuing election brought a majority of 118 for the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies over the combined Irish and Liberal members, reflecting the threat felt by Home Rule.

Undaunted, and certain Home Rule's time would yet come, Parnell in the aftermath of the Home Rule Bill dissociated himself from the launching of the Plan of Campaign, after agrarian war flared up again, fearing to identify Home Rule and constitutional nationalism with militant agrarian violence. His more canny supporters wanted to secure the votes of the growing low-to-middle income electorate and felt that their own campaign would head off any support for the more radical [[Michael Davitt]]. Essentially they were copying Davitt's earlier methods without his more radical policy.

In December 1886, [[Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]'s Conservative government declared the Campaign to be "an unlawful and criminal conspiracy". Parnell, unable to prevent it, persuaded O'Brien to confine it at that stage to the estates upon which it was operating. However, the campaigners had moral support from the Catholic Archbishop of [[Dublin]], [[William Walsh (archbishop of Dublin)|William Walsh]], and from the [[Archbishop of Cashel]], [[Thomas William Croke]]. Many other bishops supported it, while opposition was led by the Bishop of [[Limerick]], Edward O'Dwyer. A complication for the church was that it had lent money to larger [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] landlords, such as the [[Earl of Granard]] in [[Longford]], who could not pay their mortgage payments to the Church when receiving no rents.

==Coercion Act==
The renewal of the Land War in the form of the Campaign, was a matter of grave concern to the government and, determined to crush it, Salisbury appointed his nephew, [[Arthur Balfour]], fresh from his attack on the [[Scottish Land League]], to the post of [[Chief Secretary of Ireland]]. Balfour secured a tough [[Irish Coercion Act]] or Perpetual Crimes Act (1887), aimed at the prevention of [[boycott]]ing, intimidation, unlawful assembly and the organisation of conspiracies against the payment of rents. The Act resulted in the imprisonment of hundreds of people including over twenty MPs, all of whom had done no more than help evicted tenants. The so-called 'Crimes Act' (or "Coercion" Act) was condemned by the Catholic hierarchy, for it was to become a permanent part of the law and did not have to be renewed annually by parliament. Trial by jury was abolished. Balfour also had the National League declared illegal and its many branches suppressed. He went further and sent armed police and soldiers to evict tenants, using [[battering ram]]s against small cottages after sieges of several days. These dramatic scenes were reported by the press around the world and aroused much sympathy in Britain for those evicted.
[[File:Mitchelstown Eviction (8029207132).jpg|right|thumb|250px|Evicted building in Michelstown 1887 during the Plan of Campaign]]
Dillon and O'Brien were arrested, and, when their supporters started a public defence fund, Archbishop Croke issued a ''No Tax Manifesto'' which prompted Balfour to consider imprisoning him also. Two priests, Fr. Matt Ryan and Fr. Daniel Keller, both within Croke's archdiocese, were imprisoned. Balfour defended Divisional Magistrate Plunkett's injunction to the police under threat: ''"Do not hesitate to shoot"'', in the House of Commons. Later in 1887, when O’Brien and a local Tipperary farmer John Mandeville were taken for trial to [[Mitchelstown]], Dillon was present and after he delivered a speech denouncing Balfour, the crowd of 8,000 threw stones at the police, who retreated and then opened fire, killing three people in what became known as the "Mitchelstown Massacre". Balfour defended his subordinates, for which O'Brien dubbed him "Bloody Balfour" in the House of Commons.

The [[Parnell Commission]] hearings in 1888–89 exonerated Parnell from involvement with murders in 1882, but also revealed a great amount of violence and intimidation. In hindsight the government felt justified in enacting special criminal laws for special circumstances.

==Papal encyclical==
The rising crime rate and general unrest forced Balfour to more subtle strategies by seeking [[Holy See|Vatican]] assistance to suppress clergymen involved in the Plan. In answer [[Pope Leo XIII]] despatched [[Ignatius Persico|Archbishop Persico]] to Ireland, who travelled throughout the country from July 1887 until January 1888, consulting prominent members of the hierarchy. A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Plan and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the Papal encyclical [http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm "Saepe Nos"] that was addressed to all the Irish bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from relevant article in "Ireland's Own" magazine (extracted 17 November 2006) on Monsignor Daniel Keller, The People's Priest by Maurice Aherne ………..In September 1896, he accompanied a party of Bishops and Priests to Ivrea, Turin, for the beatification of a former Bishop of Cloyne- Thadeus McCarthy. Whilst there he sought, and was granted, an audience with Pope Leo XIII, who had condemned the Plan of Campaign. He left an enlightened Pope with a Special Papal Blessing for 'The Plan of Campaign' stalwart, Maurice Doyle, who had spent seven months in jail for his beliefs. That was not all he brought back from Rome. He also obtained Papal permission to hold the Eucharist Procession in Youghal on Corpus Christi and the very first one ever held in Ireland was held in Youghal……….&lt;/ref&gt;

This was openly denounced as an impertinence by the Irish MPs and the clergy itself divided on the issue. A general resentment of the Vatican's intrusion into Irish affairs helped to win some support for the Plan, which was by now in financial difficulties. That ran counter to the [[Ultramontane]] policy adopted by [[Paul Cullen (cardinal)|Cardinal Cullen]] since the 1850s, which included total obedience to papal decrees. Suspicion arose that the encyclical was issued in hopes that Britain and the Papacy would appoint ambassadors to each other and establish diplomatic relations.

The covering letter with the encyclical was written by [[Raffaele Monaco La Valletta]], Cardinal Secretary of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]], and included:
:"The justice of the decision will be readily seen by anyone who applies his mind to consider that a rent agreed upon by mutual consent cannot, without violation of a contract, be diminished at the mere will of a tenant, especially when there are tribunals appointed for settling such controversies and reducing unjust rents within the bounds of equity after taking into account the causes which diminish the value of the land.... Finally, [regarding boycotting] it is contrary to justice and to charity to persecute by a social interdict those who are satisfied to pay rents agreed upon, or those who, in the exercise of their right, take vacant lands."

Persico later commented, "I had no idea that anything had been done about Irish affairs, much less thought that some questions had been referred to the Holy Office, and the first knowledge I had of the decree was on the morning of the 28th April, when I received the bare circular sent me by Propaganda. I must add that had I known of such a thing I would have felt it my duty to make proper representations to the Holy See".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.failteromhat.com/book/mcdonnell-homerule.htm McDonnell on Home Rule (1908) page 104-108]&lt;/ref&gt;

Persico was rewarded soon after his return by the Vicariate of the [[Roman Colleges#Seminario Vaticano|Vatican Seminary]] and in 1893 was appointed a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]].

==New Tipperary==
[[File:"Success to New Tipperary; 'tis the glory of our land!" (8557077664).jpg|right|thumb|250px|New Tipperary in construction 1890]]

Balfour encouraged the landlords in 1889 to form an anti-tenant syndicate under the chairmanship of Tipperary landlord and [[High Sheriff]] of [[County Cork|Cork]], [[Arthur Smith-Barry, 1st Baron Barrymore|Arthur Smith-Barry]]. As the landlord's agent, Smith-Barry, ennobled as Lord Barrymore, was authorised to buy up estates which were threatened by the Plan and then evict the tenants, which he carried out in the case of the Charles Ponsonby estate in [[Youghal]].  This brought him into conflict with his own tenants, largely the tenants of [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] town, who in anger refused to pay rents. When evicted they moved with their shops to pursue their livelihoods outside the town boundaries and built 'New' Tipperary under the direction of Fr. David Humphreys&lt;ref&gt;Denis G. Marnane, "Fr David Humphreys and New Tipperary", [https://books.google.com/books?id=y5kNAAAAIAAJ Tipperary: History and Society], {{ISBN|0906602033}}, 1985, 367–378&lt;/ref&gt; and O'Brien, just released from prison. The Tipperary project, comprising two streets with houses, proved too costly for the Plan's leaders and this led to its defeat. By this time Parnell had been induced to give some support which helped in the formation of a Tenants' Defence Association in Tipperary and this, along with Dillon's raised money, enabled the Plan to continue. The organisers had £84,000 in 1890 but this had shrunk to £48,000 within a year, by which time almost 1,500 tenants were receiving grants from the Plan funds.

==Parnell's change of policy==
The organisation looked unavailingly to Parnell for further help. In the course of a speech he delivered in May 1888 to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Eighty Club]], Parnell, concerned that it would otherwise harm his alliance with the Liberals, virtually renounced his association with the Plan, this disunity with his party a precursor of the more momentous split to come. The organisers were forced to seek financial assistance elsewhere and Dillon embarked on a fund-raising drive in Australia and New Zealand (May 1889 – April 1890) which raised some £33,000, but this was insufficient for their needs. In October Dillon and O'Brien jumped bail and escaped to France, and from there to America where they were empowered by Parnell to raise more money (£61,000, which he intended for the Irish party).

Parnell also had to distance himself from the Campaign during the [[Parnell Commission]] hearings in 1888–89. While the main outcome was very favourable to him, much of the surrounding evidence suggested that the organisers of the Campaign and the former Land War had incited, or were complicit in, the attendant violence.

==Victory in principle==
As Balfour had hoped, the organisers found it difficult to raise enough money to pay stipends to those evicted during the Campaign and now forced to live on party doles. By 1893 the Campaign was over. It had resulted in settlements on eighty-four estates; on fifteen estates the tenants had gone back on the landlords' terms and no settlement had been reached on the remaining. Although the organisers claimed they had been victorious, the price paid was high, the huge expenditure involved, the hardship suffered by those imprisoned under the Coercion Acts (also known as ''[[Treason Felony Act 1848|Crimes Acts]]''), the tragedy of those evicted whose farms fell into dire neglect, some not restored to their farms until 1907, and the subsequent embittered relationship between the parties on estates where the landlord had given in.

The Campaign attracted many British and foreign journalists to Ireland as well as Liberal MPs some of whom were imprisoned under the Coercion Acts, which increased sympathy for Home Rule. The Conservative Party as a result of its mishandling lost sympathy among the working classes in Britain. Balfour however in the following decade, surprisingly, became one of Ireland's better Chief Secretaries, when he amended and introduced new land acts, encouraged various economic schemes, local industries, extension of the railways and the introduction of local government.  His approach, much in keeping with his character, had been from the beginning two-pronged –  ''I shall be as relentless as [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] in enforcing obedience to the law, but, at the same time, I shall be as radical as any reformer in redressing grievances and especially in removing every cause of complaint in regard to the land''.

==Outcomes==
In December 1890, following the verdict in the '’O'Shea v [[Katharine O'Shea|O'Shea]] and Parnell'’ divorce case the IPP split. This diverted attention from the Campaign which slowly petered out. The IPP also wanted to disassociate itself from the more violent aspects on the approach to the [[Irish Home Rule Bill 1893|Second Home Rule Bill]] that narrowly succeeded with a majority of 30 in the House of Commons but was then defeated by the House of Lords in 1893.

The Irish land question was addressed after the 1902 [[Land Conference]] by the main reforming [[Irish Land Acts#Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act 1903|''Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act'']] of 1903, during Balfour's short tenure as Prime Minister in 1902–05, allowing Irish tenant farmers to buy the freehold title to their land with low annuities and affordable [[government-backed loan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/international/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/land-purchase-acts-1903-and-1909 Land Purchase Acts 1903+1909 encyclopedic definitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

With origins as early as the 14th century, pluricontinentalism gained official state sponsorship in the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime. 

It was the idea that Portugal was not a colonial empire ([[Portuguese Empire]]), but a singular nation state spread across continents (hence the name).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/default.aspx?pal=pluricontinental Dicionário Priberam da Língua Portuguesa: Pluricontinental]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/20081702 Portugal's First Domino: 'Pluricontinentalism' and Colonial War in Guiné-Bissau, 1963–1974, by Norrie Macqueen, 1999 Cambridge University Press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time that Portugal was a pluricontinental country was during the reign of [[Maria I of Portugal]], with the creation of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1560">'''"Pomperipossa in Monismania"''' (also called '''Pomperipossa in the World Of Money''') is a satirical story written by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] children's book author [[Astrid Lindgren]] in response to the 102% [[marginal tax rate]] that she incurred in 1976. It was published starting on 3 March 1976 in the Stockholm evening tabloid ''[[Expressen]]'' and created a major debate about the Swedish tax system.

The marginal tax rate above 100%, dubbed the 'Pomperipossa effect', was due to tax legislation that required self-employed individuals to pay both regular income tax and employer's fees.

The story, a satirical allegory about a writer of children's books in a distant country, led to a stormy tax debate and is often attributed as a decisive factor in the defeat of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], for the first time in 40 years, in [[Swedish_general_election,_1976|the elections later the same year]]. Lindgren, however, continued to support the party for all her life.

[[Image:Rappenkrieg wildenstein.jpg|thumb|[[Andreas Ryff]] and the peasants beside [[Wildenstein Castle (Bubendorf)|Wildenstein Castle]] in May 1594]]

The '''Rappenkrieg''' was a peasant uprising lasting from 1591–1594, involving a conflict between the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] city of [[Basel]] and the surrounding   [[Prince-Bishopric of Basel]].  

At issue was an increase in the rate of [[sales tax]] on [[wine]] and [[meat]].   After several years the conflict was ended through negotiations headed up by the Basel merchant turned politician [[:fr:Andreas Ryff|Andreas Ryff]].

The name "Rappenkrieg" comes from the local word, [[Rappen]], then as now the term for a low value coin:  "Rappenkrieg" can be loosely translated as the "Pence/Cents War".

The Basel '''Rappenkrieg''' is not to be confused with the ''[[Rappenkrieg (1612-1614)|Rappenkrieg]]'' in [[Further Austria|Western Austria]] from 1612 to 1614 in the adjacent [[Fricktal]] and the [[Rhine]], although both had similar causes.

==Origins==
The economic backdrop was furnished by agricultural prices which had risen to record high levels as a result of population increase, the splitting of small holdings on inheritance, and resulting shortage of land.   This was occurring in the context of a succession of poor harvests attributed by some historians to a "[[Little Ice Age]]".

The political context from the second half of the sixteenth century included a sustained increase in religious tensions as [[protestantism]] grew in popularity among the citizenry in this part of the [[Swiss confederation]], while the [[Roman Catholic]] Prince-Bishops of Basel, galvanized into an increasingly active fight-back by the [[Counter-reformation]], lost respect and influence.

In 1575 [[Jakob Christoph Blarer von Wartensee]], the newly appointed Prince-Bishop of Basel, committed himself to the [[:de:Rekatholisierung|recatholicisation]] of the entire region, and in 1579 he secured alliances with the principal catholic towns and territories locally.   
His relationship with the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] city of [[Basel]] was now polarised along religious lines.  The city found itself increasingly isolated among its more regiously conservative Swiss confederate neighbours, and was obliged to agree to the 1585 [[:de:Badener Vertrag 1585|Baden Agreement]], a principal feature of which was the requirement to make prince bishop an enormous payment of 200,000 [[Guilders]]. The Baden Agreement was seen at the time as a major victory for the counter-reformation.

==Fighting breaks out==
In order to raise the necessary money, the city decided to increase taxes on wine and meat with effect from January 1591. Already under growing economic pressure, the farmers protested against this major tax increase, but the city rejected their protest and marking out their representatives as potential troublemakers. Relations deteriorated and the protests degenerated into an insurrection. A notable spokesman for the farmers was a protestant from [[Liestal]] called Osimus Battmann, was singled out for blame by the city government. 
Battmann was arrested for a second time in September 1593 and subjected to intensive questioning which may have amounted to torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhs.ch/externe/protect/textes/f/F19175.html Battmann, Osimus&lt;!-- Titre généré automatiquement --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escalation and resolution==
The city fathers maintained a hard line against the insurgency.   Other measures were taken including a decree forbidding inn keepings from plying their trade.   The conflict became more militarised when the insurgents tried to prevent implentation of the decree by force.   Fifty soldiers were sent to Liestal on 13 May 1594 under the command of [[:fr:Andreas Ryff|Captain Andreas Ryff]] to put down the insurrection.   Two days later, an unsuccessful attempt was made to arrest Hans Siegrist from [[Niederdorf, Basel-Landschaft|Niederdorf]], one of the movement's leaders.   This escalated the affair and the angry farmers responded by taking up their arms and gathering on the beside to the [[Wildenstein Castle (Bubendorf)|castle at Wildenstein]].   For his part Ryff, now with a force of 170 men confronted the rebels.   It now turned out that Ryff was willing to use a diplomatic combination of sympathy and menace on behalf of the city in order to try and avert the threat of a wider civil war.   There followed several days of uncertainty and negotiation between Siegrist and Ryff until eventually Ryff managed to persuade his compatriots that a tax increase was necessary. 

The compromise agreed involved restricting the tax increase on wine to three times its pre-crisis level.   The insurgents were spared punishment and it was agreed that they would not be fined for the expenses which their protest had imposed on the city.

The '''Royal Society of St George''' is an [[England|English]] [[Patriotism|patriotic]] society established in 1894 to encourage interest in the English way of life, and English [[Convention (norm)|customs]] and [[traditions]].

==History==
In 1415 [[St. George]] became the [[Patron Saint]] of England after the English soldiers fighting under the command of King [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] had beaten the [[France|French]] at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Ever since then, St George has been the patriotic rallying point for the [[English people]].

Before the formation of The Royal Society of St. George and the [[American Revolution]], Societies of St. George had been founded in the then North American Colonies for the relief of British immigrants and to give them general assistance in the new country. The earliest Branches of which there are any records are those of New York (1770), Philadelphia (1772) and Charlestown (1773). Subsequently Branches were formed in all the great cities of the North American continent and celebrations were always held on St. George's Day. At the time of the War of Independence many Loyalists moved to Canada and founded similar Societies in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] (1786) and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalsocietyofstgeorge.com/intro.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507043225/http://www.royalsocietyofstgeorge.com/intro.htm |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Ruff was the founder in 1894 and the first Honorary Secretary of the Royal Society of St. George. In 1900 he gave up farming to devote his time exclusively to the Society.&lt;ref name="TIMES1928"&gt;Obituary: Mr Howard Ruff. ''[[The Times]]'', 2 November 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society's first Royal Patron was [[Queen Victoria]] - each monarch since has been the patron of the Society.

The Society is incorporated by a [[Royal Charter]] which was presented by [[Elizabeth II]] in 1963 and has its own [[Coat of arms|Armorial Bearings]] granted under [[Letters Patent]] in 1990 and also now has members and branches around the world.

==The Society's role today==
[[File:Royal Society Of St George.jpg|thumb|A Royal Society of St George banner at the [[Stone Cross, West Midlands|Stone Cross]] St George's parade in 2014.]]Today the Society considers itself as the standard bearer of traditional English values, both at home and abroad. Of itself, the Society says, our 
{{cquote|&amp;hellip;role is primarily educational, promoting the common [[cultural]] heritage of people throughout the [[English-speaking world]], including our former [[British Dominions|Dominions]] and [[Colonies]]. The Society now focuses its work on the younger generations of English and kindred people whose most valuable inheritance is our nation's history and [[English culture|culture]].}}

==The Society's objects==

*To foster the love of England and to strengthen England and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] by spreading the knowledge of [[English history]], traditions and ideals.
*To keep fresh the memory of those in all walks of life, who have served England or the Commonwealth in the past, to inspire leadership in the future.
*To combat all activities to undermine the strength of England or the Commonwealth.
*To further [[English interest]] everywhere to ensure that [[St. George's Day]] is properly celebrated and to provide focal points all the world over where English men and women may gather together.

[[File:Karte Haus Burgund 4 EN.png|thumb|Territories of the house of Valois-Burgundy during the reign of Charles the Bold.]]
Around the 13th and early 14th century, various Dutch cities became so important that they started playing a major role in the political and economical affairs of their respective [[fief]]s.&lt;ref name="MMA"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/euwl/ht07euwl.htm "Low Countries, 1000–1400 A.D."], in ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same time, the political system of relatively petty lords was ending, and stronger rulers (with actual power over larger territories) started to emerge.

In the case of the Dutch, these two developments resulted in the political unification of all Dutch fiefs within a supra-regional state. This process started in the 14th century, with the [[County of Flanders|Flemish cities]] gaining previously unseen powers over their county.
When [[Louis II, Count of Flanders]], died without a male heir, these cities ([[Bruges]], [[Ypres]], and [[Ghent]]) arranged a marriage between his daughter and the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Duke of Burgundy]]. By doing this, they set in motion a chain of events eventually leading to the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] and, in 1482, the [[Habsburg Netherlands]].

==Under Burgundy==
*In 1384, [[Philip the Bold]] acquired the [[county of Flanders]], [[County of Artois|Artois]], and the [[County of Burgundy|Franche-Comté]] by the death of his father-in-law, [[Louis II, Count of Flanders|Louis II of Flanders]], whose daughter and heiress [[Margaret III, Countess of Flanders|Margaret]] was Philip's wife.
*In 1421, [[Philip the Good]] (the grandson of Philip the Bold) buys the [[County of Namur]] from [[John III, Marquis of Namur]].
*In 1430, [[Philip I, Duke of Brabant|Philip of Brabant]] died childless, leaving his cousin [[Philip the Good]] as his heir in [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant, Lothier]], and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]].
*In 1432, the [[Hook and Cod wars]] ended in victory for the [[County of Holland|Hollandic cities]], Philip the Good was offered to become [[count of Holland]], [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]].
*In 1443, Philip conquers the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]]
*In 1456, Philip managed that his illegitimate son, [[David van Bourgondië|David]], was elected [[Episcopal principality of Utrecht|Bishop of Utrecht]], leading to the [[First Utrecht Civil War|First]] and [[Second Utrecht Civil War]]. 
*In 1456, he also had his nephew [[Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège|Louis of Bourbon]] become [[Prince-Bishop of Liège]], leading to the [[Liège Wars]].
*In 1473, Philip's son, [[Charles the Bold]] buys the [[Duchy of Guelders]] from [[Arnold, Duke of Guelders|Duke Arnold]]. However, the house of Burgundy lost this title at Charles's death in 1477.
*In 1477, Charles the Bold died fighting an alliance led by the King of France. France annexed the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], but the title ''Duke of Burgundy'' remained in titular use, as seen with his only child, his daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] (Mary the Rich).

==Under Habsburg==
*1478: Mary the Rich marries [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I of Habsburg]].
*1482: death of Mary the Rich. Maximilian assumes rule over what are now effectively the [[Habsburg Netherlands]]. Artois ceded to France by the [[Treaty of Arras (1482)|Treaty of Arras]].
*1493: [[Treaty of Senlis]]. Artois and St. Pol back in Habsburg hands. Flanders becomes a fief of the Holy Roman Empire.
*1506: Maximilian and Mary's grandson [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] inherits his family's Dutch lands. He is also the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[King of Spain]].
*1521: Charles V conquers [[Tournai and the Tournaisis]], until then under French influence. 
*1524: Charles conquers [[Friesland]], renamed [[Lordship of Frisia]], during the [[Guelders Wars]]. 
*1528: Charles liberates the [[Episcopal principality of Utrecht|Bishopric of Utrecht]] and its lands in [[Overijssel]], then annexes them as [[Lordship of Utrecht]] and [[Lordship of Overijssel]], during the [[Guelders Wars]]. 
*1536: Charles conquers the [[Lordship of Groningen]] and [[County of Drenthe]], during the [[Guelders Wars]]. 
*1543: Charles reclaims and conquers the [[Duchy of Guelders]] and the [[County of Zutphen]] (in personal union), during the [[Guelders Wars]].
*1549: [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549|Pragmatic Sanction]] creates the [[Seventeen Provinces]].

Politically, the Burgundian and Habsburg periods were of tremendous importance to the Dutch, as the various Dutch fiefs were now united politically into one single entity.&lt;ref name="GrNed"&gt;Chapter 3, Forming Political Unity, paragraph 3; ''The Age of Habsburg (1477–1588)''.&lt;/ref&gt; The period ended in great turmoil, as the rise of Protestantism, the centralist policies of the [[Habsburg Empire]], and other factors resulted in the [[Dutch Revolt]] and the [[Eighty Years' War]].

==History==
Just before WWII, refugees from Nazism came to Belgium, some clandestinely. Jews and communists were heavily represented among them, some of whom assembled in informal movements such as ''Main-d'oeuvre étrangère'' and ''[[Main-d'œuvre immigrée]]'' (as in neighbouring France). Aid associations were created, such as ''Le Secours rouge'' (Red Relief). When the war began, ''Solidarité juive'' was one of these associations and worked closely with the ''[[Comité de Défense des Juifs]]'', and with ''Secours mutuel'' (left-wing Zionists).

The objective of the UPJB is ''The promotion of a contemporary, secular, and progressive Judaism in the diaspora, in the filiation of the struggle of the workers movement and of the anti-Nazi resistance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-fr|la promotion d’un judaïsme contemporain laïc, progressiste et diasporiste, dans la filiation des combats du mouvement ouvrier et de la résistance anti-nazie}}, [http://www.upjb.be/fr/presentation.htm Union des Progressistes Juifs de Belgique] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210072300/http://www.upjb.be/fr/presentation.htm |date=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgian affiliations==
The UPJB is not a member of the ''Comité de coordination des organisations juives de Belgique'' (CCOJB, Coordination Committee of Belgium's Jewish Organizations), the Belgian chapter of the [[World Jewish Congress]], because it disagrees with one of its Zionist statutory clauses, ''the association has for purpose the fight (...) for the support by all appropriate means of the State of Israel, spiritual centre of Judaism and safe haven of threatened Jewish communities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-fr|L'association a pour objet de lutter (...) pour le soutien par tous les moyens appropriés à l'Etat d'Israël, centre spirituel du judaïsme et havre pour les communautés juives menacées.}}, article 3 of the CCOJB statutes, published in: [http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/vzw/vzwf.htm ''Annexe au Moniteur belge du 24 août 2000'', nr. 19275 - 19292, p.9961]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, UPJB, through an open letter signed by its then president Elie Gross, supported the main Belgian French-speaking daily ''[[Le Soir]]'' during a campaign from the Belgian [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations, including the CCOJB, which accused its journalists of a systemic anti-Israeli bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.lesoir.be/carte-blanche-la-paille-et-la-poutre_t-20011017-Z0L1YX.html|title=La paille et la poutre|last=Gross|first=Elie|date=October 17, 2001|publisher=[[Le Soir]]|language=French|accessdate=2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Župan''' is a noble and administrative title used in several states in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]] between the 7th century and the 21st century. It was (and in [[Croatia]] still is) the leader of the administrative unit [[župa]] (or zhupa, [[županija]]). The term in turn was adopted by the [[Hungarians]] as ''[[ispán]]'' and spread further.

==Origin of the title==
The exact origin of the title is not definitively known and there have been several hypotheses: Slavic (F. Miklošič), Turkic-Avarian (A. Bruckner), Iranian (F. Altheim), Proto Indo-European (V. Machek), Indo-European (D. Dragojević), Illyrian-Thracian (K. Oštir), Old-Balkan (M. Budimir), among others.{{sfn|Peter Štih|1995|p=127}} The title was preserved primarily among the Slavic peoples and their neighbours who were under their influence.&lt;ref name="Biliarsky"&gt;{{cite book |first=Ivan |last=Biliarsky |date=2011 |title=Word and Power in Mediaeval Bulgaria |url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=O-j66lYzINEC |publisher=Brill |pages=368 |isbn=9789004191457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its presence among [[Pannonian Avars]] and Avar language is completely undetermined.{{sfn|Peter Štih|1995|p=127}}{{sfn|Smiljanić|2007|p=34}} On the contrary of a specific theory, it should be noted that the title origin is not necessarily related to the origin of the titleholder.{{sfn|Peter Štih|1995|p=127}}

In 2009, A. Alemany considered that the title ''*ču(b)-pān'', often in a northeastern Iranian milleu, had an Eastern and Central Asian derivation, ''čupan'', and a Western and European derivation, ''župan''. The Eastern ''čupan'' first occurs, but allegedly as is usually connected with ''čupan'', in a [[Bactria]]n contract dated to 588 [[Anno Domini|AD]], where are mentioned two "headman" (''σωπανο'', "sopano");{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=3}} among the [[Western Turkic Khaganate|Western Turks]] (582-657), the leader of the fifth Shunishi [[Uysyn|Dulu]] tribe was a ''chuban chuo'' (''čupan čor''), while the leader of the fifth Geshu [[Nushibi]] tribe was ''chuban sijin'' (''čupan irkin''), with ''chuo'' and ''sijin'' being the standard title of the each tribe's leader,&lt;ref name="Golden"&gt;{{citation |author=Peter Benjamin Golden |author-link=Peter Benjamin Golden |title=Oq and Oğur~Oğuz* |publisher=Turkish and Middle Eastern Studies, Rutgers University |year=2012 |url=http://www.enu.kz/repository/repository2014/oq-and-ogur.pdf |pages=footnote 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; inferior to ''qayan'' ([[khagan]]), but superior to ''[[Bey#Etymology|bäg]]''.{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=3}} However, there is no mention of ''čupan'' in [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] runic incsriptions;{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=3-4}} a Chinese document (c. 8th century) near [[Kucha]] mentions severals persons (allegedly [[Tocharians]]) with patronymic Bai and title ''chuban'';{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=4}} in the same century, in the Chinese documents of province [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] are mentioned word ''chiban'' and alleged title of low rank ''chaupam'';{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=4}} the first (Old) Turkic document recording the title ''čupan'' is a [[Uyghur Khaganate|Uyghur]] decree from [[Turpan]] dated c. 9th-11th century.{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=4}} According to the work ''Dīwānu l-Luġat al-Turk'' by the 11th century scholar [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]], a ''čupan'' is an assistant to a village headman.{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=4}}

The first known mention of Western ''župan'' occurs in a charter of [[Kremsmünster]] abbey, by Bavarian duke [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria|Tassilo III]] in 777 AD, in which the monastery was granted by a group of Slavs, headed by the chieftains Taliup and Sparuna, whose abode lied beneath the boundaries reported under oath by the ''iopan'' Physso;{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=4-5}} the ''zo(ō)apan'' of [[Buyla inscription]] on a buckled bowl of a heterogeneous and chronologically uncertain (7th or 8th century) [[Treasure of Nagyszentmiklós]];{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=5}} the ''supan'' in [[Sorbian languages|Lusatian]] and Latin language (7th century):{{sfn|Gluhak|1993|p=713}} the ''ζουπανος'' (zoupanos) on a silver bowl found at [[Preslav|Veliki Preslav]], capital of [[First Bulgarian Empire]] (893-972), and ''zhupan'' in Greek stone inscriptions and Cyrillic alphabet ([[Codex Suprasliensis]]) ;{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=5}} the ''zuppanis'' in Latin charter of St. George's church at Putalj by Croatian duke [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir]] in 852 AD;{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=6}} the Slavic, generally considered of [[White Croats]], title of king's deputy mentioned by [[Ahmad ibn Rustah|Ibn Rusta]] in the 10th century, the ''sūt.ğ'' or ''sūb.ğ'', of which corrupted text some transcribe as ''sūbanğ'' (probably Turkic ''[[Subaşi|sū beḫ]]'');{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=6}} according to [[Constantine VII]] in his 10th century work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', Croats, Serbs and other Slavic nations of Dalmatia had the ''ζουπάνους'' (zoupanous), "Princes, as they say, these nations had none, but only ''župans'', elders, as is the rule in the other Slavonic regions";{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=6}} also the Croatian state was divided in 11 ''ζουπανίας'' (zoupanias) administrative regions,{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=6}} with additional three ruled by ''βοάνος'' (boanos) or ''μπάνος'' (b/mpanos) ([[Ban (title)|Ban]]);{{sfn|Živković|2012|p=143}} and is individually mentioned ''ζουπανου'' (zoupanou) [[Beloje of Trebinje|Beloje]] of [[Travunija|Travunia]];{{sfn|Živković|2012|p=188}} later among Serbs it also temporary became a title for supreme leader '' ζουπανος μεγας'' (zoupanos megas, [[Grand Župan]]);{{sfn|Gluhak|1993|p=713}} in Czech sources ''supani'' (1187).{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=227}}

==Etymology==
In Polish, Czech, Slovak and Ukrainian allegedly from ''župan'' was shortened to ''pan'', meaning "master, mister, sir".&lt;ref name=Kmietowicz&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Slavs |author=Frank A. Kmietowicz |publisher=Worzalla Pub.

*[[Franz Altheim]] derived the title from [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] etymon *''fsu-pāna''- that evolved to ''šuβān'' in [[Parthian language|Parthian]], ''šupān'' and ''šubān'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]; all these words meaning "shepherd".{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=7}}{{sfn|Erdal|1988|p=227}} [[Gerhard Doerfer]] suggested possible Iranian origin for [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]]'s ''čupan'' linking it with New Persian ''čōpan'', a variant form of ''šubān'', with usual change of ''š-'' to ''č-''.{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=7}} [[Omeljan Pritsak]] in Iranian *''fsu-pāna'' saw "shepherd of (human) cattle" in Avar service, using the Slavic masses as cannon fodder.{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=7}} Some scholars derived it from alleged Old Iranian ''ašurpan/aszurpan'', meaning "great lord, noblemen".&lt;ref name="Majorov"&gt;{{cite book |last=Majorov |first=Aleksandr Vjačeslavovič |year=2012 |title=Velika Hrvatska: etnogeneza i rana povijest Slavena prikarpatskoga područja |trans-title=Great Croatia: ethnogenesis and early history of Slavs in the Carpathian area |language=Croatian |location=Zagreb, Samobor |publisher=[[Brethren of the Croatian Dragon]], Meridijani |pages=95, 92–95 |isbn=978-953-6928-26-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jerzy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bechcicki |first=Jerzy |chapter=O Problematici Etnogeneze Bijele Hrvatske |trans-chapter=On the issue of ethno-genesis of the White Croatia |year=2006 |editor1-last=Nosić |editor1-first=Milan |title=Bijeli Hrvati I |trans-title=White Croats I |language=Croatian |location=Rijeka |publisher=Maveda |pages=8–9 |isbn=953-7029-04-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered that the title origin can be traced to the [[Proto-Slavic borrowings#Slavic and Iranian|Slavic and Iranian]] cultural interrelation in the Eastern and Southeastern Europe in the first centuries AD.&lt;ref name="Majorov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jerzy"/&gt;
*[[Karl Brugmann]] derived the [[Common Slavic]] *''županъ'' from ''župa'' "district, small administrative region",{{sfn|Brugmann|1900|p=111}} &lt; ''*geupā'', comparing this word with [[Sanskrit|Skt.]] ''gopā-'' (herdsman, guardian), derived from ''gopaya'' (to guard, protect), of ''gup-'', or even ''go-pā'' (cow-herd), Avestan ''gufra-'' (deep, hidden), among others.{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=7}} [[Oleg Trubachyov]] derived it from ''*gupana'' (from ''gopaya'', the guard of cattle).&lt;ref name="Oleg"/&gt; A Central Asian descent was claimed by [[Karl Heinrich Menges]], who considered ''župan'' a slavicized form of Altaic ''čupan'' (a loanword from Iranian), with modified meaning from "clan, community" to "district".{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=8}} According to research done by scholars Ambroży Bogucki, Bohumil Vykypĕl and [[Georg Holzer]], in 2007 Franjo Smiljanić concluded that is excluded any Avar influence on the origin, yet within the Avar authority were preserved the remnants of Slavic tribal organization.{{sfn|Smiljanić|2007|p=34}}
*According to Alemany, the (Old) Turkic ''ču(b)'' is most probably a Turkic loanword from Khotanese ''-cū'' and Chinese ''zhou'' (perfecture), which was a Chinese territorial administration applied to Central Asian regions inhabited by Iranians, but it has even older meaning of small island; a township unit; a region, up to ''zhoumu'' (regional governor) from [[Han dynasty|Han]] to [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] dynasty.{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=8-10}} Alemany pointed out that, as there were settlements of Central Asian Iranians at least in some of those ''zhou'', the title ''čupan'' as ''*ču(b)-pān'' (protecting a ''ču(b)'' or ''zhou''), was an Iranian rendering (see ''[[Marzban|marz-bān]]'', "protecting the marches"), of the Chinese ''zhoumu''.{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=11}} The suffix ''-pān'' (from [[Avestan language|Avestan]] and [[Old Persian]] ''pat'', "protector"; ''pā-'', "to protect, to care") is well documented in [[Manichaeism|Manichean]] [[Parthia]]n texts from [[Turpan]], and lesser extent in [[Sogdia]]n and [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotanese]].{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=11}} He concluded that the title designs both ''regio'' and ''rector'', and if čupan was a loanword introduced by the Avars as some assumed, but there was already a common Slavic word ''župa'', their association could explain the shift ''č-'' &gt; ''ž-'' in ''župan''.{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=12}}

However, as the title among Avars is undetermined, on the basis of preserved toponyms which are etymologically related to the title župan, like ''Županovo kolo'' in [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]], Russia, and ''Župany kolo'' in Ukraine, as well it was spread in Slavic languages which were not in contact with Avar language,{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=227}} the assumption it was of Avar origin is highly doubtful and dismissed by many scholars as it occurs in wider area than is the area where lived Slavs and Avars together.{{sfn|Smiljanić|2007|p=34}}{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=227}}

==Usage of the title and division==
The title had a widespread distribution, and did not always had a concrete institutional definition.&lt;ref name="Biliarsky"/&gt; Slavic tribes were divided into fraternities, each including a certain number of families.&lt;ref name=ZU-Zupan&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yugoslav village|author=Zagreb.

The ''župan'' title was also used in [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] (in modern Romania) but only with the meaning "mister" and bearing no administrative connotations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

As heads of the ''županija'', the most important role of the ''župans'' were their public authority function.{{sfn|Smiljanić|2007|p=35}} They were the ''primates populi'', nobile aristocracy from where the king (or duke) recruited the official servants.{{sfn|Smiljanić|2007|p=36}} Those ''župans'' by origin most probably belonged to the tribal or noble family structure, in historiography known as "twelve tribes", which are mentioned in the [[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta conventa]] and [[Supetar Cartulary]].{{sfn|Smiljanić|2007|p=36}} In the Supetar Cartulary, and in Croatian redaction of [[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]], they were called as ''nobile sapienciroes'' and ''starac'' (elderman), indicating that to the agreement with king [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman]] went twelve "elders župan".{{sfn|Smiljanić|2007|p=39}}

According to the charter by Croatian duke [[Muncimir of Croatia|Muncimir]] (892 AD) it can be identified various official functions; ''župans'' who work at the ducal palace (''Budimiro zuppani palatii'', ''Prisna maccererarii'', ''Pruade zuppano cauallario'', ''Zelestro zuppano camerario'', ''Zestededo zuppano pincernario'', ''Bolledrago zuppano carnicario'', ''Budimiro zuppano comitisse'', ''Augina zuppano armigeri''), who are part of territorial organization (''Zelllerico zuppano Cleoniae'', ''Sibidrago zuppano Clesae''), or are only noble by position (''Petro zuppano'', ''Pribritreco filius Petri zuppano'').{{sfn|Smiljanić|2007|p=35}} The ''župans'' were usually listed in historical documents only as witnesses, without mark of duty.{{sfn|Smiljanić|2007|p=35}}

The transition of 12th to the 13th century is characterized by  terminological change of the title ''župan'' and the spreading beyond the tribal main territory.&lt;ref name="Damir"&gt;{{citation |last=Karbić |first=Damir |date=2004 |title=Šubići Bribirski do gubitka nasljedne banske časti (1322.) |trans-title=The Šubići of Bribir until the Loss of the Hereditary Position of the Croatian Ban (1322) |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=11822&amp;lang=en |journal=Zbornik Odsjeka za povijesne znanosti Zavoda za povijesne i društvene znanosti Hrvatske akademije znanosti i umjetnosti |publisher=[[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] |language=Croatian |volume=22 |pages=5 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older social rank of the ''župan'' (''iupanus'') in Latin documents was changed with the title ''[[Comes#Feudalism|comes]]''.&lt;ref name="Damir"/&gt; The Latin term ''comes'' in the 14th and 15th century Croatia was translated in two different ways, as ''špan'' and ''knez''.&lt;ref name="Damir"/&gt; The first signified the royal official in the ''županija'', while the second the hereditary lord of the ''županija'' exempted from the direct royal rule.&lt;ref name="Damir"/&gt; Thus the term lost its old tribal and got a new administrative meaning, while the old Croatian tribes (genus) under the title of ''knez'' preserved the inheritance rights over the lands of ''županija''.&lt;ref name="Damir"/&gt;

===Hungary===
{{Main|Ispán}}

There were several "ispán"'s in the royal court of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian Kingdom]]: 'nádorispán' ([[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]]), 'udvarispán' (court ispán), 'kápolna ispán' (chapel ispán), and 'ispán's of the financial hierarchy ('harmincadispán', 'pénzverőispán', 'sókamaraispán', 'urburaispán'). Similarly the leaders of the ethnic groups were called 'ispán' like 'besenyők ispánja' ([[Besermian]] ispán) '[[Count of the Székelys|székelyispán]]' ([[Székelys|Szekler]] ispán).

According to Fine, the governorship was hereditary, and the ''župan'' reported to the Serbian prince, whom they were obliged to aid in war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier ''župan'' title was abolished and replaced with the Greek-derived ''kefalija'' (''[[kephale (Byzantine Empire)|kephale]]'', "head, master").&lt;ref name=Anderson290&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=sP_2-y9zKfgC&amp;pg=PA290 p. 290]&lt;/ref&gt;

The title ''župan'' is widely used as an informal name for presidents of self-governing regions (''župa'') in Slovakia.
