'''1918 Aiguillon''' provisional designation {{mp|1968 UA}}, is a dark [[asteroid]] from the outer region of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 20 kilometers in diameter.

It was discovered by French astronomer [[Guy Soulié]] at [[Bordeaux Observatory]], France, on 19 October 1968.&lt;ref name="MPC-Aiguillon" /&gt; The asteroid was named for the French town of [[Aiguillon, Lot-et-Garonne|Aiguillon]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''Aiguillon'' orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|outer]] main-belt at a distance of 2.8–3.6&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 5 years and 9 months (2,085 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.13 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 9[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The first observation was a [[precovery]] taken at [[Palomar Observatory]] in 1954, extending the body's [[observation arc]] by 14 years prior to its official discovery observation.&lt;ref name="MPC-Aiguillon" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

According to the survey carried out by NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] with its subsequent [[NEOWISE]] mission, ''Aiguillon'' measures 19.5 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.062.&lt;ref name="Masiero-2014" /&gt;

Based on a generic [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]-diameter conversion, the body measures between 12 and 28 kilometers, for an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25 and an [[absolute magnitude]] of 11.7.&lt;ref name="h" /&gt; As of 2017, ''Aiguillon''{{'}}s composition, [[rotation period]] and shape remain unknown.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named for the discoverer’s birthplace, [[Aiguillon, Lot-et-Garonne|Aiguillon]], a small town on the Garonne river in France.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The approved naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 1 December 1979 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 5038}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

On August 16th, 2017 Cal Jet announced that the Carlsbad [[McClellan-Palomar Airport]] would be their home/hub, announcing daily non-stop service to [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas's]] [[McCarran International Airport]] through a partnership with [[Elite Airways]] unveiling a new brand called [[Cal Jet]] by [[Elite Airways]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/tourism/sd-fi-vegas-flight-20170816-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.10news.com/news/new-flights-to-las-vegas-to-start-out-of-carlsbad&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ch-aviation.com/portal/news/58715-elite-airways-unveils-cal-jet-brand-for-las-vegas-flights&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Initial Service ===
On August 16, 2017, Cal Jet announced daily nonstop service from [[Carlsbad, California]] to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], with service starting September 28, 2017. Cal Jet by Elite Airways initially operated two flights daily, departing from  [[McClellan-Palomar Airport]] at 9:00AM and 12:45PM. With return flights from Las Vegas [[McCarran International Airport]] at 11:00AM and 2:45PM. This is the first commercial service from the [[McClellan-Palomar Airport]] in over two years. Cal Jet by Elite Airways operates these flights using a [[Bombardier CRJ700]], with 7-14 Business Class seats, and 56 Economy seats.  The inaugural flight was at 9AM local time, September 28, 2017 from the Carlsbad [[McClellan-Palomar Airport]] to Las Vegas [[McCarran International Airport]]. Tickets went on sale via [http://www.caljetelite.com Cal Jet's website] on August 16, 2017 with one-way fares starting at $69. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Airline-Offering-Commercial-Flights-Out-of-Carlsbad-to-Las-Vegas-440848423.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs8.com/story/36153525/commercial-flights-to-be-available-out-of-carlsbad&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://fox5sandiego.com/2017/08/16/airline-now-offers-flights-from-carlsbad-to-las-vegas/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancellations and Reduction in Service ===
On February 15, 2018, Cal Jet cancelled all flights, leaving many travelers stranded when they dedicated their plane to NCAA operations. Cal Jet stated that they would resume service on February 27&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/tourism/sd-fi-caljet-vegas-20180222-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;, but they did not resume until March 2, with substantial delays following.

In March 2018, Cal Jet reduced service from 14 round trips per week to 9. 

In mid-April 2018, Cal Jet cancelled all flights, leaving many travelers stranded in an event similar to the February cancellation period, and reducing the confidence of San Diego travelers in the reliability and viability of the airline. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.10news.com/news/carlsbad-based-airline-cal-jet-abruptly-cancels-more-flights&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if the airline will resume service or if travelers issued vouchers will be able to use them &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/tourism/sd-fi-caljet-cancels-vegas-20180420-story.html.&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 28, 2018, Cal Jet has not resumed service, and the Cal Jet website does not show any flights available.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.caljetelite.com/find-flights&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CA floristic province.png|thumb|right|California floristic province]]
The '''California Floristic Province''' ('''CFP''') is a [[floristic province]] with a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean-type climate]] located on the [[Pacific Coast]] of [[North America]] with a distinctive flora similar to other regions with a winter rainfall and summer drought climate like the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. This [[biodiversity hotspot]] is known for being the home of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierran]] [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia tree]] and its close relative the [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]].&lt;ref name="Conservation International"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conservation.org/where/priority_areas/hotspots/north_central_america/California-Floristic-Province/Pages/default.aspx |title=Conservation International|website=Conservation.org|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the Province was designated as a biodiversity hotspot allowing it to join ranks among 33 other areas in the world with a large number of [[endemic]] species. To be named a biodiversity hotspot, an area has to contain species and plant life that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The California Floristic Province is home to over 3,000 species of vascular plants, 60% of which are endemic to the province.&lt;ref&gt;Burge, D. O. et al. [http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3120/madr-63-02-3-206.1 Plant diversity and endemism in the California Floristic Province]. ''[[Madroño (journal)|Madroño]]'', 63:3-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

The California Floristic Province belongs to the [[Madrean Region]] of the [[Holarctic Kingdom|Holarctic]] (or Boreal) Floristic Kingdom. As part of the Madrean Region, it is bordered on its east by the [[Great Basin Floristic Province]], and to the south and southwest by the [[Sonoran Province]] (which includes the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]], [[Colorado Desert|Colorado]], [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]], and [[Baja California Desert]]s). To the north, the region is bordered by the [[Rocky Mountain Floristic Region|Vancouverian Province]] of the [[Rocky Mountain Region]], and much of coastal and mountain [[Northern California]] and southwestern [[Oregon]] are defined as falling into either province depending on a given author's delimitations.

With an area of {{convert|293,803|km2|abbr=on}}, as defined by [[Conservation International]], it includes 70% of [[California]] and extends into southwestern [[Oregon]], a small part of western [[Nevada]] and northern [[Baja California]]. The province is bordered by, and sometimes defined as partly coincident with, the [[Rocky Mountain Floristic Region]] in the north. This boundary is poorly defined as some leading geobotanists, including [[Robert F. Thorne]] ([[Flora of North America]]) and [[Armen Takhtajan]], include [[Oregon]] and [[Northern California]] within the Rocky Mountain Province.&lt;ref&gt;Thorne, Robert F. [http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/FNA/Volume/V01/Chapter06.shtml Phytogeography of North America North of Mexico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040317091646/http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/FNA/Volume/V01/Chapter06.shtml |date=2004-03-17 }}. ''[[Flora of North America]]'', Vol. 1, Ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The California Floristic Province is a world biodiversity hotspot as defined by [[Conservation International]], due to an unusually high concentration of [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plants: approximately 8,000 plant species in the geographic region, and over 3,400 taxa limited to the CFP proper, as well as having lost over 70% of its primary vegetation. A biodiversity hotspot contains irreplaceable areas to the plants and animals that live there. Among these unique regions, almost every one of them is subject to their exclusive species being at greater risk from the impact of humans. The greatest threat to this area is wilderness destruction caused by large commercial farming industries and the heavy expansion of urban areas. Conservation International proposed a strategy in 1998, to focus more specifically on areas of the California Floristic Province that contained the most human impact in order to lower the threat to the region. The issues that are causing the most threats to this province include but are not limited to population pressures, loss of habitat, unsustainable resource use, and introduced non-native species.&lt;ref name="HOTSPOT: California on the Edge" /&gt;

== Climate and topography ==
The California Floristic Province is one of the five biodiversity hotspots with [[Mediterranean climate]]s, and it is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Many parts of the coastal areas of this hotspot, being moderated by the ocean, experience cool summers due to the regular occurrence of ocean [[fog]], which sustains [[redwood]] forests amongst other communities.&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tree-care.com.au/|title=Tree Removal Melbourne - Tree Surgery Melbourne - Professional Tree Care Services|website=Tree-care.com.au|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, the province includes most of the state excluding the [[Modoc Plateau]], [[Great Basin]] and [[desert]]s in the southeastern part of the state. In Oregon, the province includes the coastal mountains south of [[Cape Blanco (Oregon)|Cape Blanco]] and most of the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tree Removal|url=http://www.72tree.com/tree-removal-atlanta.html|accessdate=2 April 2014|year=2014|publisher=Tree, Seed and Land Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Baja California, the province includes the [[forest]] and [[chaparral]] belts of the [[Sierra de Juárez|Sierra Juarez]] and the [[Sierra San Pedro Martir]] (but excluding their desert slopes to the east), [[coast]]al areas south to about [[El Rosario, Baja California|El Rosario]], and [[Guadalupe Island]].

In Nevada, the CFP includes the region of the Sierra in the vicinity of [[Lake Tahoe]], with the eastern border with the Great Basin corresponding roughly to the location of Reno-Carson City.

Parts of the following mountain ranges are included in the province:
* The [[Klamath Mountains]]
* The [[Cascade Range]]
* The [[Coast Ranges (California)|Coast Ranges]]
* The [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]
* The [[Transverse Ranges]]
* The [[Peninsular Ranges|Peninsular ranges]] south into Baja California

The [[Great Central Valley]] is also within the CFP.

== California plant communities ==
Numerous plant communities exist in California and botanists have attempted to structure them into identifiable vegetation types groupings. [[Robert Ornduff]] and colleagues [[Phyllis M. Faber]] and [[Todd Keeler-Wolf]] did much work on this problem, and in the 2003 [[Natural History Guide]] [[Introduction to California Plant Life]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} established a cohesive set of titles to identify California plant communities based on but somewhat different from those earlier established by California botanist [[Philip A. Munz]].

Broken into three large groupings based on geography, the Ornduff scheme includes {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}:
the Cismontane ("this side of the mountain") west of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] or [[San Jacinto Mountains]], or North of the [[Transverse Ranges]], Montane, and Transmontane ("the other side of the mountain"), in the [[rainshadow]] of these ranges, typically [[desert]].

=== Cismontane region ===
* [[Coastal Strand]] (same in Munz)
* [[California coastal prairie|Coastal Prairie]] (same in Munz)
* [[California coastal salt marsh|Coastal Salt Marsh]] (same in Munz)
* [[Chaparral]] (Hard Chaparral) (same in Munz)
* [[Closed-Cone Pine Forest]] (same in Munz)
* [[Coastal Sage Scrub]] (Soft Chaparral) (same in Munz)
* [[Freshwater marsh]] (same in Munz)
* [[Maritime Coast Range Ponderosa Pine forests]]
* [[Montane Chaparral]] (not in Munz)
* [[North Coastal Forest]] (includes North Coastal Coniferous Forest, Redwood Forest, Douglas-fir Forest and Mixed Evergreen Forest (from Munz) )
* [[Northern Coastal Scrub]] (same in Munz)
* [[Riparian Woodland]] (same in Munz)
* [[California oak woodland|Valley]] and [[Foothill Woodland]] (includes Northern, Southern Oak Woodland, Foothill Woodland)
* [[Valley Grassland]] (same in Munz)

=== Montane region ===
* [[Montane Coniferous Forest]] (Yellow Pine in Munz)
* [[Montane Chaparral]] (not in Munz)
* [[Sierra Nevada subalpine zone|Subalpine Forest]] (Red Fir Forest, Lodgepole Pine Forest, Bristlecone Pine and Subalpine Forest)
* [[Montane Meadow]] (not in Munz)
* [[Alpine Fell-field]] (same in Munz)

=== Transmontane region ===
* [[Pinyon-Juniper Woodland]] (Includes Northern Juniper Woodland, Pinyon-Juniper Woodland (both in Munz))
* [[Artemisia tridentata|Sagebrush]] Scrub (same in Munz)
* [[Shadscale Scrub]] (same in Munz)
* [[Alkali Sink Scrub]] (same in Munz)
* [[Joshua Tree Woodland]] (same in Munz)
* [[Creosote Bush Woodland]] (same in Munz)

== Endemic species and ecosystems ==
The hotspot presents a higher level of [[endemism]] in plants than in animals. Of the 7,031 [[vascular plant]]s (species, subspecies or varieties) found in the hotspot, 2,153 taxa (in 25 genera) are endemic, meaning they are found nowhere else.&lt;ref name="JM93"&gt;Hickman, J.C. (Ed.), 1993. The Jepson Manual, Higher Plants of California. University of California Press. Appendix I, Pg. 1315.&lt;/ref&gt; About 80,000&amp;nbsp;km², or 24.7% of the original vegetation remains in relatively pristine conditions today.

The six largest plant families in California by number of species (40% of all species of vascular plants) are:{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* [[Asteraceae]]
* [[Poaceae]]
* [[Fabaceae]]
* [[Scrophulariaceae]]
* [[Brassicaceae]]
* [[Cyperaceae]]

The province notably has [[giant sequoia]] forests, [[California oak woodland]]s (all native oaks in this ecosystem are endemic, with the exception of ''Quercus garryana'' which ranges into southwestern British Columbia) and [[Cupressaceae|redwood]] forests. Other ecosystems include [[Artemisia tridentata|sagebrush steppes]], [[opuntia|prickly pear shrublands]], [[coastal sage scrub]], [[chaparral]], [[Pinyon-juniper woodland|juniper-pine woodland]], [[montane forest|upper montane-subalpine forests]], [[alpine plant|alpine]] forests, [[riparian forests]], [[Cupressaceae|cypress forests]], [[California mixed evergreen forest|mixed evergreen forests]], and [[Douglas fir|Douglas fir forests]], [[coastal dune]]s, [[mudflat]]s and [[salt marsh]]es.

A few examples of plants that are endemic to the province and are also [[endangered species]] are:
* [[Baker's larkspur]]
* [[Gowen cypress]]
* [[Hickman's potentilla]]
* [[Point Reyes bird's beak]]
* [[Santa Cruz Tarplant]]
* [[Santa Rosa Island Manzanita]]

== Threatened and endangered ==
Agriculture and urban expansion are encroaching upon remaining [[habitat]]s in the California Floristic Province. Commercial farming in the region generates half of all agricultural products consumed by the [[United States]] population. The large farms that grow from this demand cause the greater loss of the biodiversity hotspot's natural un-renewable resources. California has one of the highest human populations rendering it one of the four most ecologically degraded expanses in the United States. Other threats include [[invasive species]] [[colonisation#Habitat - botany and zoology|colonisation]], [[strip mining]], [[oil extraction]],  [[air pollution]], [[soil contamination]], [[Grazing#In agriculture|livestock grazing]], [[wildfire]]s (excessive heat or frequency types), and construction of building developments and roads. [[Global warming]] presents future threats. Research done by United States Ecologist, Dr. Erik Beever, suggests that global warming may have had a hand in the local extinction of the [[pika]] populations in the [[Great Basin]] area east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. More research proposes that as the temperature keeps rising, alpine species will begin to migrate north looking for cooler climates that can support more of a sustainable habitat. Reducing emissions from the burning of [[fossil fuels]] such as coal, oil, and gas is the first step in the fight against global warming.&lt;ref name="HOTSPOT: California on the Edge" /&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Biodiversity hotspots face the highest threats due to the fact that their resources and animal or plant species cannot be replicated or found in any other regions on the planet. Conservation efforts receive little to no funding to put toward the protection of these extremely distinctive hotspots so establishing priorities on where to focus efforts is essential. In 1988, British Ecologist, [[Norman Meyers]] discovered the ten tropical hotspots that contained endemic species. Then, in 1990, Meyers added eight more hotspots to the list, one of which was the California Floristic Province. Due to Meyer's extensive research into the biodiversity of these hotspots, Conservation International began a major assessment of these regions in 1996. It is not until 1999, however, that [[Conservation International]] finally sets restrictions on what makes up the criteria for a biodiversity hotspot. The California Floristic Province contained more than 1,500 endemic species of vascular plants and had lost at least 70% of its original natural habitat, and so it became the eighth ranked hotspot in the world. As a result, 37% of the province is now under official protection. California had spent more money on the conservation of these precious lands than any other state in [[United States|America]]. The conservation efforts created to protect the California Floristic Province would not be possible without the major contributions from organizations such as the [[Sierra Club]], [[Nature Conservancy]], [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]] and the [[California Native Plant Society]].&lt;ref name="HOTSPOT: California on the Edge" /&gt;

The [[Departments of Benin|departments]] of [[Benin]] are subdivided into 77 [[commune (subnational entity)|communes]], which in turn are divided into arrondissements and finally into villages or city districts. Prior to 1999 provinces were broken down into 84 districts, titled either urban or rural.  Before independence, the six provinces were subdivided into [[Cercle (French colonial)|Cercle]]s, [[cantons]], préfectures and [[villages]] or [[town]]s.&lt;ref&gt;statoids&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|The Doldrums|the Ariel album|The Doldrums (album)}}
{{Otheruses}}
{{wiktionary|doldrums}}
The '''doldrums''' is a [[colloquial]] expression derived from historical [[maritime history|maritime]] usage, which refers to those parts of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] affected by a low-pressure area around the [[equator]] where the [[prevailing winds]] are calm.  The doldrums are also noted for calm periods when the winds disappear altogether, trapping [[sailing ship]]s for periods of days or weeks.  The term appears to have arisen in the eighteenth century, when trans-equator sailing voyages became more common.  Since this zone is where two [[trade winds]] meet, it is also called the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]].  They roughly lie between latitudes five degree north and south.

==Maritime usage==
In maritime usage, the low pressure characteristics of the doldrums are caused by the expanding atmosphere due to heating at the equator, which makes the air rise and travel north and south high in the atmosphere, until it subsides again in the [[horse latitudes]].  Some of that air returns to the doldrums through the [[trade winds]].  This process can lead to light or variable winds and more severe weather, in the form of [[squall]]s, thunderstorms, and hurricanes.  The doldrums are also noted for calm periods when the winds disappear altogether, trapping sail-powered boats for periods of days or weeks.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Colloquial usage==
Colloquially, the "doldrums" are a state of inactivity, mild depression, listlessness, or stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/doldrums |title=Doldrums|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word may be derived from ''dold,'' an archaic term meaning "stupid", and ''-rum(s)'', a noun suffix found in such words as "[[tantrum]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/doldrums|work=Random House Dictionary|publisher= Random House, Inc.|date= 2011|title=Doldrums}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature and writing==
The doldrums are notably described in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' (1798), in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s novel ''[[Desolation Island (novel)|Desolation Island]]'' (1978), and in [[Laura Hillenbrand]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption]]'' (2010). Additionally, the Doldrums are a fictional place in [[Norton Juster]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' (1961).

[[Noel Gallagher]] used the term to describe a woman stuck in the decade of the [[1960s]] in the song [[Holy Mountain (song)|Holy Mountain]] “get out of the doldrums, baby now!”

The National System of Conservation Units (SNUC) law recognises ecological corridors as portions of natural or semi-natural ecosystems linking protected areas that allow gene flow and movement of biota, recolonization of degraded areas and maintenance of viable populations larger than would be possible with individual units.{{sfn|Corredor ecológico – ISA}}
The federal Ecological Corridor Project has its roots at least as far back as 1993.
It has identified seven major corridors, with focus on implementing and learning from the Central Amazon Corridor and the Central Atlantic Forest Corridor.{{sfn|Corredor ecológico – ISA}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1517">'''Gorodomlya Island''' ({{lang|ru|остров Городомля}}) is located on [[Lake Seliger]] in [[Tver Oblast]], [[Russia]], {{convert|200|mi|km|order=flip|sigfig=1}} northwest of [[Moscow]]. The [[closed city|closed]] [[urban-type settlement]] of [[Solnechny, Tver Oblast|Solnechny]] is located on the island.

The Soviet government established a biological research center at Gorodomlya Island in 1928. During the 1930s the island was a test site for [[pathogen]]s that cause [[foot-and-mouth disease]].

In 1946, more than 170 German rocket scientists and engineers, including [[Helmut Gröttrup]] and [[Fritz Karl Preikschat]], were brought to the island to work on the [[Soviet space program]]. The German colony at Gorodomlya was designated as Branch 1 of research bureau [[NII-88]]. The bureau participated in the design of the [[R-14 (missile)|R-14]] and [[R-1 (missile)|R-1]] rocket, a version of the [[V-2]] manufactured with Russian parts.

The '''Great Arctic State Nature Reserve''' ({{lang-ru|Большой Арктический государственный природный заповедник}}) is a [[nature reserve]] in [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], [[Russia]].  With an area of {{convert|41692|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, it is the largest reserve of [[Russia]] and [[Eurasia]], as well as one of the largest in the world.
==History==
The Great Arctic State Nature Reserve was founded on May 11, 1993 by Resolution No.431 of the Government of the [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigarctic.ru/Eng/|title=General Information and history|publisher=Great Arctic Nature Reserve|accessdate=October 31, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008044746/http://www.bigarctic.ru/Eng/|archivedate=October 8, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nature Reserves in Russia are known as ''[[zapovednik]]s''.
==Sections==
The Great Arctic State Nature Reserve is divided into nine sections:
*[[Dikson Island|Dikson]] - [[Sibiryakov Island|Sibiryakov]] section.
*The [[Kara Sea]] Islands section, with a surface of {{convert|4000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. It includes the [[Kirov Islands|Sergei Kirov Islands]], the [[Voronina Island]], the [[Izvestiy TSIK Islands]], the [[Arkticheskiy Institut Islands]], the [[Sverdrup Island (Kara Sea)|Sverdrup Island]], the [[Uedineniya Island]] and a number of smaller islands. This section represents rather fully the natural and biological diversity of Arctic Sea islands of the eastern part of the Kara Sea.
*The Pyasino section. Includes the [[Pyasino Gulf]] and the [[Pyasina River]] basin.
*The [[Middendorff Bay]]
*The [[Nordenskiöld Archipelago]]
*The '''Lower Taimyr''' section. Includes the basin of the [[Taimyr River]] (upper and lower), as well as [[Lake Taimyr]].
*The Chelyuskin Peninsula. Includes the northern end of the [[Taimyr Peninsula]]
*The '''Northern Reserve''' (Североземельский).
*The [[Yenisei Gulf#Islands|Brekhovsky Islands]] Natural Reserve

==Ecology==
{{also|Russian Arctic National Park}}
Many animals and plants are meant to thrive within the Great Arctic State Nature Reserve without human disturbance. Among the animals that are protected by this reserve, some of the most important are the [[polar bear]], the [[Arctic fox]], the [[snowy owl]], the [[reindeer]] and the [[Beluga (whale)|beluga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wild-russia.org/ Wild Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greater Kuala Lumpur''' is the geographical term that determines the boundaries of Metropolitan [[Kuala Lumpur]] in [[Malaysia]]. Though similar to the term "[[Klang Valley]]", there remains a variation between the two. It is similar to [[Greater London]] and [[Greater Toronto]]. It covers an area of 2,793.27 square km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_566936.html|title=The Straits Times Singapore}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before 1974, when Kuala Lumpur was still part of Selangor, there was once a greater ''Kuala Lumpur district'' covering what is today the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, [[Ampang, Selangor|Ampang]], [[Batu Caves]], [[Gombak]], [[Ulu Klang]], [[Petaling Jaya]], [[Puchong]] and [[Sungai Buloh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peta Selangor|url=http://www.selangor.gov.my/imageupload/Peta_Mukim_Negeri_Selangor-23Jul2006-064727.jpg|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
It is defined as an area covered by 10 municipalities surrounding Kuala Lumpur, each governed by local authorities - [[Kuala Lumpur City Hall]] (DBKL), [[Putrajaya Corporation|Perbadanan Putrajaya]] (PPj), [[Shah Alam City Council]] (MBSA), [[Petaling Jaya City Council]] (MBPJ), Klang Municipal Council (MPK), Kajang Municipal Council (MPKj), Subang Jaya Municipal Council (MPSJ), [[Selayang Municipal Council]] (MPS), [[Ampang Jaya Municipal Council]] (MPAJ) and Sepang Municipal Council (MPSp) consisting of Cyberjaya/Salak Tinggi/KL International Airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiandigest.com/news/36-local/10630-greater-kl-to-drive-rapid-growth.html|title=The Malaysia Digest|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309011608/http://www.malaysiandigest.com/news/36-local/10630-greater-kl-to-drive-rapid-growth.html|archivedate=2011-03-09|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Greater KL is a relatively new term as compared to the more prevalent and established [[Klang Valley]] term. The term Greater KL was espoused by Malaysian Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] as an urban agglomeration to spur the country's economic growth by the billions in the [[Economic Transformation Programme]] announced in 2010.

==Statistics==
In 2010, the Greater KL population was estimated at close to seven million and it contributed about RM263 billion to the nation's Gross National Income (GNI). Kuala Lumpur ranks 79th out of 140 cities in the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s survey on liveability.

In his History of Tabriz, Mustawfi writes that the people of Tabriz had spoken [[Pahalavi]] Persian before the arrival of the Mongols but that during Illkhanate rule they had adopted Adhari Turkish. He mentions further that the people of [[Maragha]], [[Zanjan Province|Zanjan]] and [[Ardabil]] had had their own Persian dialects.

'''Hamilton Airport''' {{airport codes|HLZ|NZHN}} is an airport located 14 kilometres south of the city of [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] in the [[Waikato]] region, in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webjet.com.au/airport/hamilton-hlz/|title=Hamilton Domestic &amp; International Airport (HLZ)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sited at Rukuhia, which was the name of the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] base on that site during [[World War II]]. In the year to 30 June 2011 the airport had 316,000 domestic and 46,000 international passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamiltonairport.co.nz/page/13-news-media+latest-news-press-releases|title=New services for Hamilton with Barrier Air|work=Hamilton Airport}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hamilton is the [[List of busiest airports in New Zealand|tenth-busiest airport in New Zealand]] by passenger traffic.

==History==
The airport is on land owned by Samuel Steele (brother of William Steele, who brought [[Settler colonialism|militia-settlers]] from Sydney to Hamilton in 1864)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/life-style/5045995/William-Steele-1831-1898|title=William Steele 1831-1898|website=Stuff|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; from about 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250704.2.106|title=Obituary.|date=1925-07-04|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=2017-09-26|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1929 there was a landing ground on the farm,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19290325.2.41|title=Light Plane Damaged.|date=1929-03-25|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=2017-09-26|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a site close to the city was also considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19291002.2.83|title=Airport for Hamilton.|date=1929-10-02|work=Auckland Star|access-date=2017-09-26|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 Steele's aerodrome was sold for expansion into an airport&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19350220.2.113|title=Site for Airport|date=1935-02-20|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=2017-09-26|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened by the Mayor on 12 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19351012.2.27.5|title=The Waikato Airport at Rukuhia to Be Officially Opened to-Day the Hangar and a Section of the Clubhouse (on Left) at the up-to-Date Airport at Rukuhia. the Airport, Which Has Been Made Available Through the Enterprise of Mr. C.

Fow, and Sir Alexander Young, Minister of Health.|date=1935-10-12|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=2017-09-26|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the world prepared for war, it became clear that a landing strip needed to be constructed in the Hamilton area.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} By 1935, the air strip was already in service, as a stopover for military aircraft that would land after a long journey. Services provided refueling as well as food and rest for the incoming pilots.

Travel by air began to blossom soon after the war was over, and, in 1950, the airport received its first commercial flight. The main runway was sealed in 1965, and turboprop flights began to Hamilton that year, with NAC's Fokker Friendship aircraft operating. The runway was further lengthened to accommodate Vickers Viscount, 1970, and ultimately Boeing 737 aircraft types in 1975.

In 1989, the New Zealand government sold the airport to councils representing Hamilton city (50 per cent), Waikato district (15.625 per cent), Waipa district (15.625 per cent), Matamata-Piako district (15.625 per cent) and Otorohonga district (3.125 per cent). This development led to unprecedented growth for the airport.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[Ansett New Zealand]] built an independent passenger terminal to the south of the main building, equipping it with a 'Golden Wing Club' lounge and food vending machines. The airline's ''Ansett NZ'' division operated flights to Wellington from Hamilton from 1995 until 2000, when Ansett NZ was sold to a New Zealand business consortium and rebranded [[Qantas]] NZ, with their own New Zealand domestic flights division. ''Qantas NZ'' operated at the airport until 2001, when it went into receivership. The terminal was then occupied by [[Origin Pacific]] airlines. This airline operated domestic services until it too went bankrupt in 2004. The small terminal was then left unused.

In 1998, [[Hamilton Airport Motor Inn]] was developed to cater for travellers using the airport.

A NZ$15.3 million terminal expansion begun in 2005 featured a 60 per cent increase in floorspace with improved baggage handling areas, better international and domestic check-in space, and passenger security screening. It was completed in late 2007.

[[Hugh McCarroll]] was the airport's chief executive from the early 2000s until retirement in February 2006. The current chief executive is Chris Doak, formerly growth and development general manager for electricity utilities company [[WEL Networks]].

===Trans Tasman services===
In 1994, the airport became a terminal for Trans [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]] air routes, with [[Charter airline|charter]] flights provided on [[Boeing 727]]s by [[Kiwi Travel International Airlines|Kiwi International Airlines of New Zealand]] (not to be confused with the United States-based [[Kiwi International Air Lines]]) which served [[Brisbane]], [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]]. New Zealand's Kiwi went bankrupt in 1996, but by that time [[Freedom Air]] had begun flying the same routes with [[Boeing 737]] aircraft. They also, briefly, operated flights to Nadi, Fiji, in 2005. Freedom Air ultimately decided to make Hamilton International Airport their company hub until parent company Air New Zealand closed the airline down on 30 March 2008 operating its own full service instead. By then, the [[Airbus A320]] was being operated. When passenger numbers dropped to an unsustainable level in August 2010, Air New Zealand ceased services to Australia. Virgin Australia attempted to fill the need for a trans Tasman service later that year with twice-weekly Boeing 737-800 flights to Brisbane; however, passenger numbers remained low and Virgin Australia ended flights on 27 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2012/08/virgin-to-cut-hamilton-nz-flights-on-slack-demand/|title=Virgin to cut Hamilton NZ flights on slack demand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No further international flights have been made from the airport since that date.

===Flight training===
Hamilton Airport is home to the New Zealand Training Centre of CTC Aviation. CTC is a British flight training organisation that provides freshly trained airline pilots to numerous airlines throughout the world, mainly within the United Kingdom, most notably [[EasyJet]], and also including [[British Airways]], [[Qatar Airways|Qatar]], [[Flybe]], [[Thomson Airways|Thomson]], [[Thomas Cook Airlines|Thomas Cook]] and [[Monarch Airlines]] amongst others.
Most of the non-passenger traffic at this airport is generated by CTC training flights, in single-engined [[Diamond DA20]] and [[Cessna 172]], and twin-engined [[Diamond DA42]] Twin Star aircraft.

The [[Waikato Aero Club]] has been based at Hamilton Airport since 1933. The club provides a full range of flight training from recreational flying in [[Light Sport Aircraft]] through to commercial Multi-Engine IFR.

==Capabilities==
The airport currently accommodates many different types of aircraft, from piston-engined light aircraft to commercial turboprop aircraft such as the [[ATR 72]]. The airport can handle all light business jets as well as 40-to-80-seat regional jets such as the [[Embraer]] [[E195]] and [[Bombardier CRJ200]]. Several airliners can operate from the airport including the 100-200 seat [[Boeing 737]], [[Boeing 757]] and [[Airbus A320]]. The largest aircraft authorised to land at Hamilton is the 150-to-250-seat [[Boeing 767]]. Plans to increase runway length from 2,195m to 3,000m to attract larger aircraft and start Asian regional flights, have been considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4314804a34.html |title=Waikato plans flights to Asia |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airport operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

In August 2011, approval was received by Hamilton International Airport to extend its runway up to 3,000 metres—the same size as secondary airports in other parts of the world, such as the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]. It will finish before 15 years' approval ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hamiltonairport.co.nz/company-information/news-media/latest-news/hamilton-airport-runway-approved-to-3000m/ |title=Hamilton Airport runway approved to 3000M |date=12 August 2011 | work=Hamilton Airport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airport has a single terminal building and 6 tarmac gates.

The '''Hermes Road Measurement System''' is the result of the EU-funded project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermesroadmeasurement.eu/index.html|title=FP7 - Hermes|work=hermesroadmeasurement.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Innovative, Highly Efficient Road Surface Measurement and Control System'' that was undertaken between August 2012 and July 2014. The project was funded through the European Union's Seventh Framework Capacities Programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/capacities/research-sme_en.html|title=European Commission: CORDIS: FP7:Research for the benefit of SMEs|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aimed at supporting research for the benefit of small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). This is realised by cooperation between a group of SMEs from several European countries, working in collaboration with a number of research and technological development (RTD) institutes, collectively constituting the project's consortium.

The Hermes system enables both the longitudinal and transversal profiles of a road to be simultaneously measured from a specially equipped vehicle travelling at normal road speeds. The developed approach has the advantage of eliminating the need for an inertial reference level, whilst improving accuracy of measurements by addressing errors otherwise resulting from the dynamics of a moving vehicle. An additional feature of this system is integration of the road profile measurements with their precise geographical location.

== Objectives ==
The project's objectives include the following:
* Development of a highly accurate longitudinal and transversal road measurement methodology.
* Design and implementation of a low-cost embedded system to execute the longitudinal and transversal measurements.
* Implementation of an integrated solution for road profile measurements incorporating state-of-the-art [[Geographic information system|GIS techniques]] for accurate localisation.
* Development of a novel information system for data logging, data extraction and data exchange with existing related systems.
* Performance of numerous field-trials, in countries represented by the project partners, of the complete system in roads having a wide range of characteristics in order to optimise system performance.

== System characteristics ==

=== Measured parameters ===
These include transversal road profile, [[Texture (roads)|macro-texture measurements]], longitudinal profile, rut depth, rut width, cross fall, curve radius, cracks, [[International Roughness Index]] (IRI), {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} mean profile depth, vehicle speed, position relative to the start point, [[GNSS|GNSS position]], together with pavement imaging and time-stamping of measurements.

=== Accuracy ===
* GNSS position horizontal accuracy: ≤0.5m RMS at speed up to 100&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Relative position to start of measurements: ≤0.5% of travelled distance.
* Longitudinal profile vertical resolution: ≤1.5mm.
* Longitudinal profile sampling interval: ≤250mm.
* Reporting interval of longitudinal profiling: ≤500mm.
* Transversal profile vertical resolution: ≤1.5mm.
* Transversal profile sampling interval: ≤350mm.
* Transversal profile repetition interval: ≤10m.
* Reporting interval of transversal profiling: ≤20m.
* Timestamps: ≤5ms.

=== Standards compliance ===
The work has been set to meet a number of requirements that were formed based on the results of questionnaires collected from interested parties. Hence, the following standards are met:
* EN 13036-1 Macrotexture Depth.
* EN 13036-2 Friction.
* EN 13036-3 Horizontal Drainability.
* EN 13036-4 Pendulum Test.
* EN 13036-5 Longitudinal Uneveness.
* EN 13036-6 Transverse Profiles.
* EN 13036-7 Straightedge.
* EN 13036-8 Uneveness.
* EN ISO 11819-1 Statistical Pass-By.
* EN ISO 13473-1 Mean Profile Depth.

== System description ==
The Hermes system comprises a mobile unit, i.e., a special measurement vehicle having laser projection and camera imaging equipment.  Acquired data is logged by a computer using a relational database.  Data is subsequently post-processed using [[Structured Query Language|Structured Query Language-based]] queries, together with sophisticated custom-developed data analysis software.
[[File:Hermes van.jpeg|thumbnail|Hermes system road measurement vehicle]]

The measurement principle is based on projecting a laser line on the road surface and recording its image using a high resolution camera of high frame rate.
The deviation of the laser line is measured, which corresponds to undulations of the road surface.

[[File:Potholehermes.webm|thumbnail|Real-time pothole detection]]

A novel automated pothole detection algorithm has also been developed to automatically characterise the quality of the road surface and detect potentially hazardous defects.
A specially-developed GNSS controller provides high accuracy localisation of acquired measurement data.

== Dissemination and exploitation ==
The developed system addresses the needs of a broad spectrum of potential end-users, including road maintainers, road constructors, air-field maintainers and national technical control centres responsible for road maintenance. The novel Hermes technology has been disseminated through a range of different activities including the following:
* Publication of results in academic and scientific journals such as the [[IEEE]] Communications Society Journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comsoc.org/|title=IEEE Communications Society|work=comsoc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karagöl-Sahara National Park''' ({{lang-tr|Karagöl-Sahara Milli Parkı}}), established on August 31, 1994, is a [[national park]] in the [[Şavşat]] district of [[Artvin Province]], Turkey. It is located in the [[Black Sea Region]] and formed by two separate areas, namely Karagöl and Sahara plateau. Karagöl is located at {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Şavşat]], while Sahara plateau is {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the town.&lt;ref name="t"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tbt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tbt2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

The national park covers an area of {{convert|3251|ha|abbr=on}} at an average elevation of {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} above mean sea level.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

A [[Traffic Separation Scheme]] is an area in the sea where navigation of ships is highly regulated. It is meant to create ''lanes'' in the water and ships in a specific lane are all going in (roughly) the same direction.

A TSS is created in locations with dense shipping where ships can go in different directions and where there is a high risk of collisions. In the overview below the regulating authority is always the [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] unless stated differently)

If below TSS or Routing Scheme is ''not'' governed by the IMO the governing body will be mentioned between '
''('''brackets''')''.

Traffic Separation Schemes and similar routing-systems can be found at:&lt;ref name="ukho"&gt;UK Hydrographic Office: [http://www.ukho.gov.uk/productsandservices/martimesafety/annualnm/17.pdf TSS shown on Admiralty Charts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824035807/http://www.ukho.gov.uk/ProductsandServices/MartimeSafety/AnnualNm/17.pdf |date=2012-08-24 }}, retrieved: 28 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* approaches to [[Manila Bay]], ''(Government of Philippines)''
* approaches to [[Manila Harbour]], ''(Government of Philippines)''
* Cebu, [[Mactan Channel]], ''(Government of Philippines)''
* [[Malapascua Island]], ''(Government of Philippines)''
* [[Batangas]], ''(Government of Philippines)''
* approaches to [[Bintulu]] Port, ''(Government of Malaysia)''

===Australia and Papua New Guinea===
In this area there are 5 TSS in operation: two in the [[Bass Strait]], governed by the IMO and three leading to [[Australia]]n ports, governed by Australia.

* South of [[Wilsons Promontory]] in the [[Bass Strait]]
* In the Bass Strait
* [[Port Jackson]], ''(Australia)''
* [[Port Darwin]], ''(Australia)''
* [[Botany Bay]], ''(Australia)''

===Aleutian Islands, Alaska, US West Coast, Canada and Mexico===
On the East side of the Pacific Ocean the TSSes are divided in two groups: the North side with the West Coast of [[Mexico]] and everything North of that. And the other group are formed by the West coast of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]].

The TSS in the far North around the [[Aleutian Islands]] and [[Alaska]] are not put in place because of the high density of shipping but the nature of the ships and the vulnerability of the area.

The TSS schemes are:

* [[Prince William Sound]] and [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] Arm
* [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] and approaches
* [[Puget Sound]] and areas around it
* [[Vancouver]] Harbour, ''(Canada)''
* off [[San Francisco]]
* [[San Francisco Bay|San Francisco Harbour]] and inner approaches, ''(USA)''
* [[Santa Barbara Channel]] in the approaches to [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Los Angeles]]
* approaches to [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], ''(API Manzanillo)''
* approaches to [[Salina Cruz]]

===Pacific: Central and South America===
The IMO governs 16 TSS schemes on the Pacific side of Central and South America:

* landfall and approaches to '''Talara Bay''', [[Peru]]
* landfall and approaches to '''Bahia de Paita''', Peru
* landfall of Puerto [[Salaverry]], Peru
* landfall and approaches to [[Chimbote]] or Ferrol Bay, Peru
* approaches to [[Callao]], Peru
* landfall and approaches to [[San Martín Region|San Martín]]
* landfall and approaches to San Nicolas Bay 
* landfall and approaches to Puerto Ilo
* landfall and approaches to [[Arica]]
* landfall and approaches to [[Iquique]]
* landfall and approaches to [[Antofagasta]]
* in the approaches to [[Quintero]] Bay
* in the approaches to [[Valparaíso]]
* in the approaches to [[Bay of Concepción]]
* in the approaches to '''Bahía San Vicente''', [[Chile]]
* in the approaches to '''Puntas Arenas'''

The [[Lima Province|province of Lima]] is divided into forty-three '''districts of Lima''' ({{lang-es|distritos}}) which are administered by the [[Metropolitan Municipality of Lima]]&lt;ref&gt;Municipalidad Lima. ''[http://www.munlima.gob.pe/ Municipalidad Lima]''. Retrieved 24 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[urban area]] of [[Lima]] is generally considered to be formed by thirty of these districts. The remaining thirteen districts consist of mostly rural and sparsely populated desert and mountainous areas. Of these peripheral districts, many of the coastal ones serve as beach resorts and their population, which is considerably smaller than that of the urban districts, increases during the summer months.

The number of inhabited islands is variously cited as between 166&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.hostelbay.com/ferries|title=Greek Island Hopping|last=Poffley|first=Frewin|publisher=Thomas Cook|year=2002|isbn=|location=|page=15|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 227.&lt;ref name="eot"/&gt;

The largest Greek island by area is [[Crete]], located at the southern edge of the [[Aegean Sea]]. The second largest island is [[Euboea]], which is separated from the mainland by the 60m-wide [[Euripus Strait]], and is administered as part of the [[Central Greece (region)|Central Greece]] region. After the third and fourth largest Greek Islands, [[Lesbos]] and [[Rhodes]], the rest of the islands are two-thirds of the area of Rhodes, or smaller.

The Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters:  the [[Argo-Saronic Islands]] in the Saronic gulf near [[Athens]]; the [[Cyclades]], a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea; the [[North Aegean islands]], a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey; the [[Dodecanese]], another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey; the [[Sporades]], a small tight group off the coast of Euboea; and the [[Ionian Islands]], chiefly located to the west of the mainland in the [[Ionian Sea]]. Crete with its surrounding islets and Euboea are traditionally excluded from this grouping.

'''Montefeltro''' is a historical-geographic region in the [[Marche]], which was historically part of [[Romagna]]. It gave its name to the [[House of Montefeltro|Montefeltro]] family, which ruled in the area during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]].

==Overview==
Montefeltro covers mostly the mountain part of the [[Province of Pesaro and Urbino]] ([[Marche]]) and the south-western area of the [[Province of Rimini]] ([[Emilia-Romagna]]). It comprises also two [[comune|municipalities]] of the [[Province of Arezzo]], [[Tuscany]], and the [[San Marino|Republic of San Marino]]. The most important town of the region is [[Novafeltria]]. Today it is part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro]], formerly until 1978 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Montefeltro.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1349">'''Obwód''' (plural ''obwody'') is a term used in Polish to denote administrative districts in various countries, particularly as a translation of the Russian ''[[oblast]]''. As administrative subdivisions of [[Poland]] itself, obwody existed as subdivisions of [[voivodeship]]s (later [[gubernia]]s) in the early part of the [[Congress Poland]] period, from 1816 until 1842, when they were renamed [[powiat]]s (the former powiats being renamed [[okręg]]i).&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Podział administracyjny Królestwa Polskiego 1837-1914|Administrative division of the Congress Poland (in Polish)]]&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Administrative division of Congress Poland]].

Obwody were also created temporarily in 1945–46, in the areas annexed to Poland from Germany as a result of the Soviet military advance. An obwód was then a subdivision of an [[okręg]]. These obwody were later replaced by powiats, and the okręgi by voivodeships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baza.archiwa.gov.pl/sezam/iza.php?nrarchiwum=65&amp;nrzespolu=357&amp;cdnumeru=0&amp;mode=showzesp&amp;search1=get&amp;offset=100 Article in Polish re 1945-46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pointe aux Canons Battery''' was a fort on the island of [[Saint Pierre Island|Saint Pierre]] in [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] built by the [[France|French]] to defend the islands from British attacks in 1690-1713. The 6 cannon battery was [[Raid on Newfoundland|destroyed by the British]] in 1702.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OHM1QewI1CcC&amp;pg=PA566&amp;lpg=PA566&amp;dq=forts+in+St.+Pierre+and+miquelon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e1rWVrJ3kr&amp;sig=_nITT5E_olDV_-nj4XrmlaucMEc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6qrSSe7II4iSMp_FjdsC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA566,M1 ''A History of Newfoundland from the English, Colonial and Foreign Records''], D. W. Prowse, at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

The old cannon battery was replaced in the 19th century to defend the islands during the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-pierre-et-miquelon.com/english/lieux.php Landmarks &amp; Monuments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725233206/http://www.st-pierre-et-miquelon.com/english/lieux.php |date=2010-07-25 }} at Saint Pierre et Miquelon website&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pointe aux Canons Lighthouse]] is located near the old fort site.

Four cannons now sit in a park near the site of the old fort, but traces of fort have disappeared with the development of the town.

'''Rago National Park''' ({{lang-no|Rago nasjonalpark}}) is a [[national park]] in the municipality of [[Sørfold]] in [[Nordland]] county, [[Norway]].  The {{convert|171|km2|adj=on}} park lies east of [[European route E06]], about {{convert|10|km}} northeast of the village of [[Straumen, Nordland|Straumen]].  The park was established on 22 January 1971.&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Rago_nasjonalpark|title=Rago nasjonalpark|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rago national park.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Valley in Rago NP]]

Rago borders [[Sweden]]'s [[Padjelanta National Park]], which in turn borders two other parks, and the combined of all the protected land is a total of ca. {{convert|5400|km2}}&amp;mdash;creating one of the largest protected areas in [[Europe]].

The lakes [[Storskogvatnet]] and [[Litlverivatnet]] lie within the park. There are several [[glacier]]s in the southeastern part of the park.  Rago National Park does not have a rich variety of plants, due partly to its poor soils and harsh climate. The wooded areas consist mostly of pine.  Many alpine plants grow among the trees.&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.dirnat.no/content/500044119/Rago-national-park-brochure|title=Rago national park|publisher=[[Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management]]|accessdate=2012-04-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407235243/http://english.dirnat.no/content/500044119/Rago-national-park-brochure|archivedate=2012-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There isn't a wide variety of animal and bird life either.  [[Moose]] live in the park along with semi-domesticated [[reindeer]].  There are also [[wolverine]]s in the park.  [[Willow grouse]] and [[golden eagle]]s are frequently seen in the park.&lt;ref name="DN" /&gt;

==Name==
The name is a shortened form of the [[Sami languages|Sami]] name ''Rágojiegna''. The first element is the genitive case of ''ráhko'' which means "sledge for tent poles" and the last element is ''jiegna'' which means "[[glacier]]".

'''Rey''' or '''Ray''' ({{IPA-fa|ɾej}}; {{lang-fa|شهر ری}}, '''Šahr-e Rey''', “City of Ray”), also known as '''Rhages''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|eɪ|dʒ|ə|z}}; {{lang-el|Ῥάγαι}}, or Europos (Ευρωπός) ''Rhagai''; {{lang-la|Rhagae}} or ''Rhaganae'') and formerly as '''Arsacia''', is the capital of [[Rey County]] in [[Tehran Province]] of [[Iran]], and the oldest existing city in the province.

Ray today has been absorbed into the [[Greater Tehran]] metropolitan area. Ray is connected via the [[Tehran Metro]] to the rest of [[Tehran]] and has many industries and factories in operation. Limited excavations of what was not bulldozed began in 1997 in collaboration with the [[Iranian Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization]] (ICHTO), the Department of Archaeological Sciences of the [[University of Bradford]] and the Department of Archaeology of the [[University of Tehran]].

According to the Iranian Chamber Society, the correct spelling of the city in both English and Persian is ''Ray'', though variations in spelling also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/cities/ray/shahre_ray.php|title=Iran Chamber Society: Iranian Cities: Shahr-e Ray|publisher=|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city university also uses the spelling ''Ray'' ("Azad University, Shahr-e-Ray"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.university-directory.eu/Iran/Islamic-Azad-University--Shahr-e-Ray.html|title=Islamic Azad University, Shahr-e-Ray - TOP ranked University - University Directory|publisher=|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does the Encyclopædia Iranica published by Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fahlaviyat|title=FAHLAVĪYĀT – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|publisher=|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Military history of Ray, Iran}}
A settlement began here c 6,000 BCE as part of the [[Central Plateau Culture]].  The settlement was used as a capital by the [[Arsacids]] called Rhaga. In Classical [[Greco-Roman geography]] it was called Rhagae ({{lang-grc-gre|Ῥάγαι}}). It is mentioned several times in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Judith|Judith]] 1:5, 15; [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] 1:14, 5:5, 6:10&lt;/ref&gt; Its name dates back to the pre-[[Medes|Median]] period. Some historians attribute its building to ancient mythological monarchs, and some others believe that Ray was the seat of a dynasty of Zoroastrian leader.

During the [[Seleucid]] period, [[Alexander the Great]]'s general [[Seleucus I Nicator]] renamed the city as '''Europos''', honouring his home city in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]. Rey is also shown on the [[4th century]] [[Peutinger Map]].
 
Ray is richer than many other ancient cities in the number of its historical monuments, among which one might refer to the 3000-year-old Gebri castle, the 5000-year-old Cheshmeh Ali hill, the 1000-year-old Bibi Shahr Banoo tomb and Shah Abbasi caravanserai. It has been home to pillars of science like [[Rhazes]].

Rey was one of the capital cities of the [[Seljuq Empire]] in the [[11th century]]. In the 13th century after the [[Mongol conquest]] the town was severely damaged and it gradually lost its importance in the presence of nearby [[Tehran]].

There is also a shrine there, dedicated to commemorate Princess [[Shahr Banu]], eldest daughter of the last ruler of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. She gave birth to [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin]], the fourth holy Imam of the [[Shia]] faith. This was through her marriage to [[Husayn ibn Ali]], the grandson of [[Muhammad]], the prophet of [[Islam]]. A nearby mountain is also named after her. However, some sources attribute the shrine to the goddess of water and fertility, [[Anahita]], claiming it was renamed in Islamic times to protect it from any possible harm after the conversion of Iranians to Islam.

In the middle of the 19th century, Ray was described as a place of ruins, the only settlement being around the [[Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine|shrine of Abdol Azim]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinrich Karl Brugsch|Heinrich Brugsch]]: ''Reise der Königlich preussischen Gesandtschaft nach Persien 1860 und 1861'', Leipzig 1862 , Volume 1, pp  230ff&lt;/ref&gt; Being the only important pilgrimage site in vicinity to the royal court in the new capital Tehran brought more people to visit the shrine and a major restoration was sponsored by the court.&lt;ref&gt;in 1854, cf [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abd-al-azim-al-hasani art. ʿABD-AL-ʿAẒĪM AL-ḤASANĪ in iranicaonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Ray was the first place in Iran to be connected to the capital by a railroad in 1888.

==Main sights==
[[File:Rey map by Ker Porter.jpg|thumb|right|1818 map by [[Robert Ker Porter]]]]
[[File:Borj-toghrul.jpg|150px|thumb|right| [[Tughrul Tower]], a 12th-century monument commemorating the Seljuq monarch [[Tuğrul Beg]], is one of the historical structures still standing today.]]
*[[Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine]]. The shrine contains the tomb of  ‘Abdul ‘Adhīm ibn ‘Abdillāh al-Hasanī,&lt;ref name="kamil"&gt;{{cite book |last=al-Qummi |first=Ja'far ibn Qūlawayh |others=trans. Sayyid Mohsen al-Husaini al-Mīlāni |title=Kāmil al-Ziyārāt |year=2008 |publisher=Shiabooks.ca Press |page=658 |chapter=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fifth generation descendant of [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan ibn ‘Alī]]&lt;ref name="kamil"/&gt; and a companion of [[Muhammad al-Taqi|Muhammad al-Taqī]].&lt;ref name="kamil"/&gt; He was entombed here after his death in the 9th century. Adjacent to the shrine, within the complex, are the mausolea of [[Imamzadeh]] Imamzadeh Tahir, son of the fourth [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Shī‘ah Imam]] [[Ali ibn Hussayn|Imām Sajjad]] and [[Imamzadeh|Imamzadeh Hamzeh]], brother of the eighth [[Twelver]] Imām - [[Ali al-Rida|Imām Reza]]).
*[[Cheshmeh-Ali (Shahr-e-Ray)|Cheshmeh-Ali]],  hill with a spring. In 1933-6 Cheshmeh Ali hill was excavated by archaeologists from the [[Boston Fine Arts Museum]] and the University Museum at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] headed by Erich Schmidt, which resulted in the discovery of 7,000-year-old artifacts. Some of the discovered objects are displayed at museums in Iran, Chicago, and Philadelphia. The hill is now mostly leveled out due to real estate expansion in the 1980s and 1990s. Nevertheless, some recent research has been done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.uakron.edu/cheshmehali/overview.html Cheshmeh Ali - A late Neolithic and Chalcolithic Village in northern Iran] uakron.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Since Ray was used as a recreation center due to its beautiful attractions under the reign of the [[Qajar dynasty]], [[Fath Ali Shah]] often used to explore the city. In 1831 his portrait and that of some Qajar princes were engraved on a rock at Cheshmeh Ali hill and its surrounding was decorated with tablets covered by poetry.
*[[Tughrul Tower|Tuğrul Tower]], constructed under the  [[Great Seljuq|Seljuqs]] at the order of [[Tuğrul Beg]] in 1140, once he transferred the capital city from Nishapur to Ray. The tower is 20 meters high and the surface of its exterior is divided into 24 sections, which besides manifesting beauty and durability, symbolizes the figures of constellation as well as a 24-hour length of time (a day and a night).
*Shah Abbasi Caravanserai. One of the ancient residential and commercial complexes, which was used as a lodging by traders and located on the shrine street, close to the [[Bazaar]]. It comprises four verandas and is surrounded by stones all around, which used to serve as a market place where goods and commercial products were presented and sold by traders.
*Ray Bazaar. Located to the north of [[Shah-Abdol-Azim]]'s shrine, it comprises two sections and a crossroad is formed at their intersection. It has long been a center for the sale of spices, traditional herbs, and commercial goods which were imported by traders via the [[Silk Road]]. The structure of the [[bazaar]] is constructed from plaster, brick, raw mud brick and mud. It dates back to the [[Safavid]] era and is approximately 500 years old.
*Anyanaj Tower, an octagonal tower known as Naqareh Khaneh stands on the slopes of Tabarak mountain. A cellar is linked to the tower from underneath through a vestibule erected outside. The tower, which is constructed by stone and plaster and decorated by brickwork and zigzag vaults, dates back to the [[Seljuq dynasty|Saljuk]] era.
*Gebri Crypt. [[Zoroastrians]] lived in this area, who used to leave the corpses of the dead in the open air usually on a structure known as a Dakhma (Persian: دخمه) or [[Tower of Silence]]. According to their traditions, once the flesh had decayed, the remaining bones would be buried. The ancient Zoroastrians disapproved of contaminating the earth ([[Zam]]) with a corpse through regular burial, or contaminating fire ([[Atar]]) through cremation (An afront to Armaiti and Asha respectively) due to the belief that corpses are [[Nasu (Zoroastrianism)|nasu]] (unclean and impure). Gebri crypt was built as a high circular structure, six meters high, which was constructed by stone and mortar. It dates back to the 1st millennium BCE, around 3,000 years ago and was earlier called by different names, such as Khamoushan tower, Ostvaran, Ostkhan-ran, Marg (Death) tower and Sokout (Silence) tower.
*Paintings of Monarchs on Ashkan Mountain. At the order of [[Fath Ali Shah]] Qajar, a slide was erected on the Ashkan mountain as a sliding and recreation tool for the monarchic family. At the southern slopes of the mountain, a rough image of the [[Sassanid]] kings has been carved on a rock, which was leveled for this purpose. The image was left incomplete. Later at the order of [[Fath Ali Shah]] the image was erased to be replaced by his own portrait, while he had a crown on head and a spear in hand targeted at a lion.

[[File:R H Colebrooke.jpg|thumb|Copy of a miniature that was painted between 1790 and 1795 showing Colebrooke in a scarlet uniform with dark blue collar.&lt;ref name=survey2 /&gt;]]
'''Robert Hyde Colebrooke''' (1762? - 21 September 1808) was a British infantry officer in India who conducted early surveys in Bengal and Mysore before becoming Surveyor General of Bengal, a position he held from 1788 to 1794 succeeding [[Alexander Kyd]].

==Life and work==
It is thought that Colebrooke was born in Switzerland. His father Robert Colebrooke (1718 - 1784) was the British ambassador to the Swiss confederacy from 1762 to 1764 and his mother was Mary (née Williams). The father had to sell his property of Chilham Castle in 1774 to pay his creditors. Colebrooke joined the Bengal Infantry in 1778. [[Thomas Deane Pearse|T.D. Pearse]] trained and appointed him as Surveyor in 1783.  Colebrooke surveyed the distance from [[Hooghly Chinsurah Municipality|Hooghly]] to [[Chennai|Madras]] using a [[Surveyor's wheel|perambulator]]. Trained in topographical illustration and surveying he produced "''Twelve views of places in the kingdom of Mysore''" in 1794 based on his work in Mysore in 1790. He accompanied [[Archibald Blair]] to survey the Andaman Islands in 1789. Colebrooke Island and Passage were named after him. Colebrooke compiled a vocabulary of Andaman islanders in an article to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. He also described the volcanic Barren Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/29353149|title=On the Andaman Islands| author=Colebrooke, R.H.|pages=401–411| year=1799|journal =Asiatic Researches|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= On Barren Island and its volcano |pages=412–415 https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/29353160 |year=1799|journal=Asiatic Researches|volume=4|author=Colebrooke, R.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Alexander Kyd]] was moved to the Andamans as Superintendent of the settlement, the position of Surveyor General of Bengal became vacant and Colebrooke was appointed in 1794. He remained in this position he kept until his death from dysentery in 1808 on the way from Rohillakhand to Calcutta at [[Bhagalpur]]. Colebrooke was a cousin of the orientalist [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|H.T. Colebrooke]]. He was promoted to Lieutenant in November 1778, Lt-Colonel in November 1803.&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical records of the Survey of India.

One of Colebrooke's suggestions, made in 1795, was that by cutting a 20 foot wide and 15–20 foot deep canal between the Hurdum and Ichamati&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://archive.org/stream/inlandnavigation032298mbp#page/n55/mode/1up/|page=44  |title=Inland Navigation On The Gangetic Rivers| author=Johnston, J.|year=1933| publisher=Thacker, Spink and Co.|place=Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt; to connect the [[Churni River]] and the Ganges would make the river navigable for 155 miles and avoid the route through the Sunderbans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British and Foreign India, China, and Australasia.|volume=17|year=1824 |pages=237–241|author=Colebrooke, R.H. |url=https://archive.org/stream/asiaticjournala19unkngoog#page/n242/mode/1up|title=Internal navigation in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was opposed by [[James Rennell]] who said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=102 |title=Cartographies of Exile: A New Spatial Literacy| first=Karen Elizabeth |last=Bishop| publisher= Routledge|year= 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Nature seems to have adjusted matters very nicely, in respect of the capacity of river beds and their levels; ... any tampering with them in delicate cases (particularly where there is so great a periodical swelling [in volume] and velocity of current) may be productive of much mischief.}}

A keen astronomer, Colebrooke also corresponded with [[John Goldingham]] at the [[Madras Observatory]] to establish the latitude of Calcutta. He was succeeded as Surveyor General by [[John Garstin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Colebrooke, R.H. |year=1803|title= On the course of the Ganges through Bengal|journal=Transactions of the Asiatic Society|volume= 7|pages=1–32|url=https://archive.org/stream/asiaticresearche07asia#page/n16/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=survey2 /&gt;

== Personal life==
Colebrooke married Charlotte Bristowe (died at Bath 2 July 1833) in Calcutta on 31 July 1795 and they had three daughters and two sons (both named Richard, one of whom born 30 December 1800 became an ensign in the Bengal infantry and died on 23 February 1868).&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; As was common in the period, he also had illegitimate children from Indian mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prior|first=Katherine|last2=Brennan|first2=Lance|last3=Haines|first3=Robin|date=2001|title=Bad Language: The Role of English, Persian and other Esoteric Tongues in the Dismissal of Sir Edward Colebrooke as Resident of Delhi in 1829|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-asian-studies/article/bad-language-the-role-of-english-persian-and-other-esoteric-tongues-in-the-dismissal-of-sir-edward-colebrooke-as-resident-of-delhi-in-1829/00632D5122DBC775A1B8C453086F84E7|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=35|issue=1|pages=75–112|doi=10.1017/s0026749x01003614|issn=1469-8099|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colebrooke's brother James (1772-18 January 1816) worked in the Madras Infantry.&lt;ref name=survey2&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Records of the Survey of India.

{{about|the constituency in Kenya|people with the name|Shamata (name)|the plant|Butea monosperma}}
'''Shamata''' is a constituency [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] of the [[Ndaragwa Constituency]] of [[Kenya]]'s [[Nyandarua County]].  It is located {{Convert|222|km|mi}} from [[Nairobi]].

Shamata Town is located 33&amp;nbsp;km from Nyahururu and 28 kilometers from Mailo-inya which is only 2 miles from the famous Thomson falls. 
The area is endowed with a plethora of resources such as the Aberdare National Park,Lake Ol'boloosat which is the only lake in Central Kenya. The lake is well known for its huge number of hippopotamus.

In terms of agriculture, it is one of the richest and most productive areas in Kenya. It is well known for the huge production of potatoes, carrots,cabbages and milk.
There are various schools in the area that have produced some of the best students in Nyandarua county such as Shamata girls high school, Horizon hope academy, Mwihang'ia primary school among others.
The area has a great potential due to the huge agricultural production, but this potential has always been hindered by the dilapidated nature of roads and political negligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7767">'''Sight reduction''' is the process of deriving from a [[Sight (device)|sight]] the information needed for establishing a [[line of position]].

Sight is defined as the observation of the altitude, and sometimes also the azimuth, of a celestial body for a line of position; or the data obtained by such observation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The American Practical Navigator]]'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays sight reduction uses the equation of the [[circle of equal altitude]] to calculate the altitude of the celestial body,

'''&lt;math&gt;\sin(Hc) = \sin(B) \sin(Dec) + \cos(B) \cos(Dec) \cos(LHA)&lt;/math&gt;'''

and the azimuth ''Zn'' is obtained from ''Z'' by:

'''&lt;math&gt;\cos(Z) = (\sin(Dec) - \sin(Hc) \sin(B)) / (\cos(Hc) \cos(B))&lt;/math&gt;'''

With the observed altitude ''Ho'', ''Hc'' and ''Zn'' are the parameters of the [[Marcq St Hilaire]] intercept for the line of position:

[[File:MarcqSaintHilaire.en.jpg|thumb|Marcq St Hilaire intercept for the line of position]]

With ''B'' the latitude (+N/S), ''L'' the longitude (+E/−W), ''LHA'' = ''GHA'' + ''L'' is the local hour angle, ''Dec'' and ''GHA'' are the declination and Greenwich hour angle of the star observed, and ''Hc'' the calculated altitude. ''Z'' is the calculated azimuth of the body.

Basic procedures involved computer sight reduction or longhand tabular methods.

== Tabular sight reduction ==
The methods included are:
* The Nautical Almanac Sight Reduction (NASR, originally known as Concise Tables for Sight Reduction or Davies, 1984, 22pg)
* Pub. 249 (formerly H.O. 249, Sight Reduction Tables for Air Navigation, A.P. 3270 in the UK, 1947&amp;ndash;53, 1+2 volumes)
* Pub. 229 (formerly H.O. 229, Sight Reduction Tables for Marine Navigation, H.D. 605/NP 401 in the UK, 1945ish, 6 volumes.  And the variant of HO-229: Sight Reduction Tables for Small Boat Navigation, known as Schlereth, 1983, 1 volume) 
* H.O. 214 (Tables of Computed Altitude and Azimuth, H.D. 486 in the UK, 1936&amp;ndash;46, 9 vol.)

* H.O. 208 (Navigation Tables for Mariners and Aviators, known as Dreisonstok, 1928, 113pg.)

== Longhand haversine sight reduction ==
This method is a practical procedure to reduce celestial sights with the needed accuracy, without using electronic tools such as calculator or a computer. And it could serve as a backup in case of malfunction of the positioning system aboard.

=== Doniol ===
The first approach of a compact and concise method was published by R. Doniol in 1955&lt;ref&gt;. Table de point miniature (Hauteur et azimut), by R. Doniol, Navigation IFN Vol. III Nº 10, Avril 1955 [http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Table-De-Point-Miniature-R-Doniol-FrankReed-jul-2015-g32063 Paper]&lt;/ref&gt; The altitude is derived from sin(''Hc'') = ''n'' − ''a'' (''m'' + ''n''), in which ''n'' = cos(''B'' − ''Dec''), ''m'' = cos(''B'' + ''Dec''), ''a'' = hav(''LHA'').

The calculation is:
 ''n'' = cos(''B'' − ''Dec'')
 ''m'' = cos(''B'' + ''Dec'')
 ''a'' = hav(''LHA'')
 ''sin_Hc'' = ''n'' − ''a'' (''m'' + ''n'')
 ''Hc'' = arcsin(''sin_Hc'')

=== Ultra compact sight reduction ===
[[File:Haversine Sight Reduction.jpg|thumb|Haversine Sight Reduction algorithm]]

A practical and friendly method using only haversines was developed between 2014 and 2015,&lt;ref name="Rudzinski_2015"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ultra compact sight reduction |author-first1=Greg |author-last1=Rudzinski |others=Ix, Hanno |journal=Ocean Navigator |publisher=Navigator Publishing LLC | location=Portland, ME, USA |date=July&lt;!-- /August --&gt; 2015 |issue=227 | issn=0886-0149 |pages=42-43 |url=http://issuu.com/navigatorpublishing/docs/on227_download_edition |access-date=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in [http://fer3.com/arc/ NavList].

A compact expression for the altitude was derived&lt;ref&gt;Altitude haversine formula by Hanno Ix http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Longhand-Sight-Reduction-HannoIx-nov-2014-g29121&lt;/ref&gt; using [[haversine]]s, hav, for all the terms of the equation:

hav(''ZD'') = hav(''B'' − ''Dec'') + (1 − hav(''B'' − ''Dec'') − hav(''B'' + ''Dec'')) hav(''LHA'')

where ''ZD'' is the [[zenith distance]]

''Hc'' = (90 − ''ZD'') the calculated altitude

The algorithm if [[absolute value]]s are used is:
 if same name for latitude and declination
  ''n'' = hav(|''B''| − |''Dec''|)
  ''m'' = hav(|''B''| + |''Dec''|)
 if contrary name
  ''n'' = hav(|''B''| + |''Dec''|)
  ''m'' = hav(|''B''| − |''Dec''|)
 ''q'' = ''n'' + ''m''
 ''a'' = hav(''LHA'')
 hav(''ZD'') = ''n'' + (1 − ''q'') ''a''
 ''ZD'' = invhav -&gt; look at the haversine tables
 ''Hc'' = 90° − ''ZD''

For the azimuth a diagram&lt;ref&gt;Azimuth diagram by Hanno Ix. http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Gregs-article-havDoniol-Ocean-Navigator-HannoIx-jun-2015-g31689&lt;/ref&gt; was developed for a faster solution without calculation, and with an accuracy of 1°.
[[File:Azimuth diagram by Hanno Ix.jpg|thumb|Azimuth diagram by Hanno Ix]]
This diagram could be used also for star identification.&lt;ref&gt;Hc by Azimuth Diagram http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Hc-Azimuth-Diagram-finally-HannoIx-aug-2013-g24772&lt;/ref&gt;

An ambiguity in the value of azimuth may arise since in the diagram 0 ≤ ''Z'' ≤ 90°. ''Z'' is E/W as the name of the meridian angle, but the N/S name is not determined. In most situations azimuth ambiguities are resolved simply by observation.

When there are reasons for doubt or for the purpose of checking the following formula&lt;ref&gt;Azimuth haversine formula by Lars Bergman http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Longhand-Sight-Reduction-Bergman-nov-2014-g29441&lt;/ref&gt; should be used.
  
hav(''Z'') = [hav(90° − ''Dec'') − hav(''B'' − ''Hc'')] / (1 − hav(''B'' − ''Hc'') − hav(''B'' + ''Hc''))

The algorithm if [[absolute value]]s are used is:
 if same name
  ''a'' = hav(90° − |''Dec''|)
 if contrary name
  ''a'' = hav(90° + |''Dec''|)
 ''m'' = hav(''B'' + ''Hc'')
 ''n'' = hav(''B'' − ''Hc'')
 ''q'' = ''n'' + ''m''
 hav(''Z'') = (''a'' − ''n'') / (1 − ''q'')
 ''Z'' = invhav -&gt; look at the haversine tables
 if Latitude ''N'':
  if ''LHA'' &gt; 180°, ''Zn'' = ''Z''
  if ''LHA'' &lt; 180°, ''Zn'' = 360° − ''Z''
 if Latitude ''S'':
  if ''LHA'' &gt; 180°, ''Zn'' = 180° − ''Z''
  if ''LHA'' &lt; 180°, ''Zn'' = 180° + ''Z''

This computation of the altitude and the azimuth needs a haversine table. For a precision of 1 minute of arc, a four figure table is enough.&lt;ref&gt;http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Longhand-Sight-Reduction-HannoIx-nov-2014-g29172&lt;/ref&gt;

==== An example ====
 Data:
  ''B'' = 34° 10.0′ N (+)
  ''Dec'' = 21° 11.0′ S (−)
  ''LHA'' = 302° 43.0′
 Altitude ''Hc'':
  ''a'' = 0.2298
  ''m'' = 0.0128
  ''n'' = 0.2157
  hav(''ZD'') = 0.3930 -&gt; table -&gt;
  ''ZD'' = 77° 39′
  ''Hc''  = 12° 21′
 Azimuth ''Zn'':
  ''a'' = 0.6807
  ''m'' = 0.1560
  ''n'' = 0.0358
  hav(''Z'') = 0.7979
  ''Zn''  = 126.6°

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4144">'''South Indian Federation of Fishermen Societies (SIFFS)''' is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) working in the marine fisheries sector. SIFFS is the apex body of organizations of small-scale artisanal fish workers based out at [[Thiruvananthapuram]] in [[Kerala]]. It has a three-tier organisational structure.

With over 6,000 member fishermen, organised through 100 primary societies in eight districts of Southern peninsular [[India]], SIFFS over the last two decades has kept its focus on strengthening the artisanal fisheries.

Established essentially as a fish-marketing organisation, SIFFS now provides a range of services to member and non-member fish workers. At present, over 50,000 fish workers including non-members are availing these services, in their numerous endeavors to assume collective control over their own destinies.

The [[tsunami]] that was caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] off the Indonesian island of Sumatra struck the Indian coast on 26 December 2004. This unprecedented event killed thousands of people, destroyed their houses and property, and made several thousands stranded across the coast line. The death toll in India is mainly in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh. Naturally, the fisherpeople are the worst hit. Thousands have died, several fishing villages were just wiped away.

SIFFS actively participated in the relief and rehabilitation activities mainly in [[Nagapattinam]] and [[Kanyakumari district|Kanyakumari]] districts of Tamil Nadu. SIFFS focussed on these two districts for two reasons: first, these are the districts that have been affected the worst. Secondly, these are the districts where SIFFS has its presence through primary fishermen societies. At [[Nagapattinam]], SIFFS was instrumental in founding the [[NGO Co-ordination and Resource Centre]] (NCRC).

'''Policy Research and Documentation''' forms a thrust area of SIFFS operations. Educating the policy makers, fisherfolk and other people by entering into dialogues with them is undertaken as part of policy research and documentation. To this end, SIFFS has undertaken many research projects, singly and jointly with following objectives.

* Promotion of socio-economic, environmental and technical investigation of issues pertinent to fisheries in response to fisheries development and management needs.
* Enhance coordination and cooperation between relevant organisations working in fisheries' related activities
* Enhance awareness and capacity of stakeholders to ensure sustainable fishery
* Raise consensus among stakeholders on approaches to address the sustainable management resources.

'''Documentation Centre'''

SIFFS is in the process of standardising its documentation system. The documentation centre at present has 1,265 books that include 824 fishery related books coming under seven main categories and 20 sub-categories and 441 non-fishery books falling under 11 categories.

Year-wise/issue number wise compilation of fishery and general/non-fishery journals has been undertaken and the documentation centre now boasts of 43 volumes consisting of 3,950 articles. Significantly, the compilation includes 3,531 articles extending to 36 volumes spanning across 335 issues pertaining to the fisheries sector. The Documentation Centre also has put together 7 volumes of general journals incorporating 43 issues and 419 articles.

The Documentation Centre also maintains 17 files that contain articles, news, brochures and other miscellaneous information.

'''Chief Executives'''
V. Vivekanandan joined SIFFS in 1982 after passing out of [[Institute of Rural Management, Anand|IRMA]] as the first Chief Executive and held the position until 1994.  [[Satish Babu]], also an alumnus of IRMA was the next CE, holding the position from 1994 to 2000. S.Ephrem was the next Chief Executive of SIFFS, (2000-2011), followed by Julian Teelar from 2011.

The '''United States Geological Survey Library''' ('''USGS Library''') is a program within the [[United States Geological Survey]], a scientific bureau within the [[United States Department of Interior|Department of Interior]] of the [[United States government]]. The [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] operates as a fact-finding research organization with no regulatory responsibility.

The [http://library.usgs.gov/ USGS Library] has major branches in [[Lakewood, Colorado]] ([[Denver Federal Center]]), and [[Menlo Park, California]] and smaller, focused research libraries in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]] and [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].

==Description==
[[Image:Usgs-headquarters.jpeg|150px|thumb|The USGS headquarters in [[Reston, Virginia|Reston]], [[Virginia|VA]]]]
Today the United States Geological Survey Library's users have access to over 3 million items: over 1.7 million books and journals, 700,000 maps, 370,000 microforms, 270,000 pamphlets, 260,000 black-and-white photographs, 60,000 color transparencies, 15,000 field record notebooks, and 250 videocassettes. Materials include USGS publications as well as those produced by state and foreign geological surveys, scientific societies, museums, academic institutions, and government scientific agencies. The libraries in Reston and Menlo Park are designated as official depositories for selected U.S. Government publications.
The libraries in Reston and Menlo Park have been designated as official Federal Government Depositories providing public access to selected U.S. Government publications.

==U.S. Geological Survey Library Classification System==
The newly revised classification system presented in this report is designed for use in the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) Library and other earth science libraries. Prior to the administration of Fred Boughton Weeks, 1903-1908, the library lacked a classification scheme. The Dewey Decimal system for geologic material was not sufficiently developed to accommodate the range of specialized material collected at the USGS Library, and The [[Library of Congress Classification]] System had not yet been published. The library staff and patrons were concerned about continued development of the collection without an acceptable classification scheme.
Mr. Weeks and bibliographer John M. Nickles of the library staff, with the assistance of three
consultants from the New York Public Library, developed the USGS classification system designed specifically for an earth science library.
The U.S. Geological Survey Library classification system has been designed for earth science
libraries. It is a tool for assigning call numbers to earth science and allied pure science materials in order to collect these materials into related subject groups on the library shelves and arrange them alphabetically by author and title. The classification can be used as a retrieval system to access materials through the subject and geographic numbers.
The classification scheme has been developed over the years since 1904 to meet the ever-changing needs of increased specialization and the development of new areas of research in the earth sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Sasscer, R. Scott. 1992, 2000. "U.S. Geological Survey Library Classification System." U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 2010. Revised June 2000. Published in the Eastern Region, Reston, Va. Manuscript approved for publication on June 8, 2000. This revision is being released online only. It is  available on the World Wide Web at: http://pubs.usgs.gov/bulletin/b2010/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special Library Collections==

===Field Records Collection — Denver, Colorado===
The [http://www.cr.usgs.gov/fieldrecords/ Field Records Collection] is an archive of unpublished field notes, correspondence, manuscripts, maps, analysis reports and other data created or collected by USGS geologists during field studies and other project work. The majority of the collection dates from 1879 and relates to work done in the contiguous United States. Materials in the collection represent almost 130 years of scientific investigations by the USGS, from the earliest days of the agency to recently completed projects. Records contributed by approximately 1,200 USGS scientists are presently archived. Located in the Central Region Library in Denver, Colorado, the collection is available for on-premises examination during normal library hours.
Field records and project archives on [[Alaska]] are kept in the Alaska Technical Data Unit Field Records Archive.

===Rare Books and Maps===
The Rare Book Collection of the USGS Library comprises unusual publications, rare books, and maps collected since 1879. Included are historical maps and publications of the Survey, as well as early publications of many federal, state and other geological surveys. Records of select geological societies are also maintained in the collection, such as the [[Geological Society of Washington]], which was founded by [[John Wesley Powell]] and other noted scientists after the Civil War. Of special note are many 19th century maps with topics such as American political boundaries, transportation, geology, and mining.

===Desnoyers Collection===
At an auction in Paris, France, pieces of M. [[Jules Desnoyers]]'s (1800–1887) library were purchased in 1885 by the USGS Library to start the foreign country collection. M. Desnoyers was a founder and later Secretary of the [[Société Géologique de France]], and in 1834 he was appointed librarian of the [[Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]] in Paris.

===William R. Halliday Collection===
William R. Halliday, M.D. (b. 1926), joined the [[National Speleological Society]] in 1947. By the late 1950s he was director of the [[Western Speleological Survey]]. His works include Adventure Is Underground (1959), Caves of California (1962), Caves of Washington (1963), Depths of the Earth (1966), Caves and Cavers of the United States (1966), American Caves and Caving (1974), Discovery and Exploration of the Oregon Caves: [[Oregon Caves National Monument]] (with [[Frank K. Walsh]]; 1976) and, [[Floyd Collins]] of Sand Cave: A Photographic Memorial (1998). He donated his private collection of rare and out-of-print books and pamphlets on caves, caving and speleology to the USGS Library in 2000.

Dr. Halliday has also donated several collections of private papers, correspondence and research to the [[University of Washington]] Library and to the [[J. Willard Marriott Library]] of the [[University of Utah]].

===Kunz Collection===
In 1933, the Library acquired the [[George F. Kunz]] collection for $1.00 from the estate of the former USGS employee and Vice-President of [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]]  The George F. Kunz Collection is a significant special collection on gems and minerals including rare books on gemology, the folklore of gemstones through history, lapidary arts and archival gem trade records important to the provenance of named stones such as the "[[Hope Diamond]]." Kunz was a former USGS employee, a vice-president of Tiffany &amp; Co., and one of the world's preeminent gem experts. The collection was acquired through the genroisty of Dr. Kunz's heirs, Mrs. [[Opal Kunz]] and Mrs. [[Hans Zinsser]]. Mr. Walter E. Reid, mining consultant and strong friend of the library, was largely instrumental in securing the Kunz collection.&lt;ref&gt;Heers, William H. 1937. "The U.S. Geological Survey Library." The Mineralogist. Volume V (6), pages 3-4, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The George F. Kunz Collection is a significant special collection of many rare books, pamphlets, and other unique materials on the acquisition, collecting and lore of jewels and precious stones. Acquired by the US Geological Survey Library in 1933 after the death of George F. Kunz, a noted mineralogist and vice-president of the Tiffany &amp; Co. of New York, the Kunz Collection today is fairly unknown outside of a small circle of gemologists, historians, and art collectors. In this paper, a short biography of George F. Kunz is given, as well as a description of the contents and scope of his collection held in the USGS Library. Some examples of the unique materials held in the collection are shown. How the Kunz Collection is used by library patrons and museums is also discussed. Appended to the paper is a bibliography of the works by and about Dr. Kunz."&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. [http://rock.geosociety.org/absindex/annual/1999/50292.htm "George F. Kunz Collection."] Denver, Colorado: Geoscience Information Society, 34th annual meeting, 1999. Includes bibliographic references (p. 142-146). Paper presented to the Geological Society of America Annual Convention in Denver, CO.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Map Collection===
The library's map collections have provided invaluable aid to authorities and scientists in times of crisis (the California Northridge earthquake in 1994 and major fires in the nation's forests). Topographic maps have also been used for genealogy research to pinpoint where ancestors lived, locate forgotten cemeteries, provide information on boundary changes, and research natural and man-made changes to areas over time. Planners have used the foreign map collections to study foreign terrain, geologic conditions and natural resources. During WWII, The [[New York Times]] (June 11, 1944) reported "A 'Commando' raid by a group of civilian scientists, a search through obscure seventeenth century French manuscripts, months of study of geological reports, experiments with model beaches – all these were part of the Allied preparations for the invasion of Normandy … The dramatic story of the preparations, which began in … libraries, shifted to laboratories and ended on the shell-swept beaches …". The collections were consulted for the military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Library maps have provided aid in international disaster areas such as the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch and volcanoes worldwide. A brief mention of a diamond found in the 1906 annual report of the USGS began a trail of research and investigation that led one geologist to prospect for diamonds in Canada.

===Topographic Map Archive===
Responsibility for the Topographic Map Archive was formally transferred to the USGS Library in Reston, Virginia, in March 2003. The Archive includes each U.S. state and territory, in all scales, editions and various printings. With coverage dating from the 1880s when the USGS began publishing standard topographic quadrangles; the Archive is the most complete collection of USGS topographic maps.

===Heringen Collection===
The Heringen Collection, is a group of military texts and maps, looted by the Nazis from European libraries, universities, geological societies, private businesses, homes and offices. Hidden in a potash mine in [[Heringen]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], they were transported by the U.S. military at the end of WWII as captured war materials. Some 23,000 reports, books and maps were accepted by the USGS Library and integrated into the main collection. The materials are consulted for research ranging from European road development, water resources use or mining and construction. In 1946, the Heringen Collection was transferred from the U.S. Geological Survey's [[Military Geology Unit]] to the Library.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. "The Heringen Collection." Information Bulletin. Western Association of Map Libraries (WAML). Volume 40 (1), November 2008. {{ISSN|0049-7282}}. Page 15.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published in journal, Earth Sciences History, the author says that the results of the German theft of Russian maps influenced the way they made maps for the next two generations. "The Heringen Collection at the US Geological Survey is a special collection of maps, books and reports stolen by units of the German Wehrmacht (armed forces) as they invaded and occupied countries during World War II. The materials in the Collection came from private, society and public library collections, and were used by military geologists in each German army to help protect its soldiers, to advance their invasion, and to consolidate their occupation. They used the maps of the occupied countries against their peoples. For a generation after the invasion of the Soviet Union, this influenced the way Russian maps were drawn and printed."&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee.

===United States Antarctic Resource Center===
The U.S. Antarctic Resource Center (USARC) in Reston, Virginia, is our Nation's depository for [[Antarctic]] maps, charts, geodetic ground control, satellite images, aerial photographs, publications, slides, and video tapes. These resources are produced by [[Antarctic Treaty]] nations in support of their activities in Antarctica and provided to the USARC in compliance with a standing resolution of the treaty providing for exchange of information. The USGS maintains these materials through an interagency cooperative agreement with the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), which also supports the USGS Antarctic Mapping Program.

===USGS Photographic Collection===
The [http://libraryphoto.cr.usgs.gov Photographic Library] is an archive of still photographs and original sketches dating from the 1870s and taken by USGS scientists as part of their field studies. Topics include USGS personnel, earthquakes, volcanoes, geologic hazards and other phenomena, historical mining operations, and earth science photographs. The works of pioneer photographers such as [[William Henry Jackson]], [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]], [[Carleton Watkins]], [[John Karl Hillers]], [[Thomas Moran]], [[Andrew J. Russell]], [[E. O. Beaman]] and [[William Bell (photographer)]] are represented in the collection. Some photographs have been used to illustrate publications, but most have never been published.

==History==
Congress authorized a Library for the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) in 1879. The library was formally established in 1882, with the naming of the first librarian, Charles C. Darwin, and began with a staff of 3 and a collection of 1,400 books. The Act of Congress establishing the USGS authorized the creation of a program for exchanging copies of USGS reports for publications of state, national, and international organizations. The exchange program was modeled after a program used by Dr. [[Ferdinand V. Hayden]] when he was head of the Interior Department's U.S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories (1867–1879). The U.S. Geological Survey Library inherited 1,000 volumes of serials from Dr. Hayden's former exchange program, which he had based on the program begun by the Smithsonian Institution in 1846.
After Dr. Hayden died in 1887, his widow donated his personal collection to the U.S. Geological Survey Library. Other early gifts were made by Major [[John Wesley Powell]], second Director of the US Geological Survey, who donated his collection of State Geological Survey reports and the family of Dr. [[Isaac Lea]] (Philadelphia publisher and gem collector whose family donated nearly 600 items of his personal library). Dr. William Halliday, a world-renowned speleologist began donating his cave collection in 2003.

In a review of the USGS Library operations in 1937, William Heers, the Chief Librarian, noted that the library had more than 200,000 books and reports, about 60,000 pamphlets, and also about 60,000 maps, most of these obtained by gift and exchange. Fully half of those researchers who used the library were outside of the US Geological Survey. In service to those outside the government, between 8-10,000 books were loaned out each year through [[interlibrary loan]]s, both within the continental US and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Heers, William H. 1937. "The U.S. Geological Survey Library." The Mineralogist. Volume V (6), pages 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the USGS Library during its centennial, it was noted that in 1978 the library had acquired nearly 116,000 new items. About 75% of these were journals, of which 10,000 serial, magazine, and other periodical titles were received. In 1978, the library also circulated 105,000 items, made 17,700 [[interlibrary loan]]s and answered some 27,000 requests for information.&lt;ref&gt;"Books, Maps..." Geotimes. March 1979. Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the USGS Library joined the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/general_pages/2012BHLMembership.pdf Press Release: Biodiversity Heritage Library Adds Two Partners. Smithsonian Libraries. March 5, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of contributing important historical works related to taxonomy as well as relevant USGS publications.

The U.S. Geological Survey Library system has become the largest earth science library in the world. Materials within the library system include books and maps dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries. Other materials include a nearly complete set of the various State Geological Survey publications and a virtually complete set of USGS topographic maps.
The original collection was based on exchange partnerships with domestic and international scientific organizations.

The '''Ural''' ({{lang-ru|Ура́л}}) is a geographical region located around the [[Ural Mountains]], between the [[East European Plain|East European]] and [[West Siberian Plain|West Siberian]] plains. It is considered a part of [[Eurasian Steppe]], extending approximately from the North to the South; from the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the end of [[Ural River]] near [[Orsk]] city. The boundary between Europe and Asia runs along the eastern side of the Ural Mountains.&lt;ref name=bse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%A3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%20(%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B8%D1%87.)/|title=Ural (geographical)|publisher=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]|access-date=31 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918062450/http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%A3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%20(%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B8%D1%87.)/|archive-date=18 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ural mostly lies within [[Russia]] but also includes a part of northwestern [[Kazakhstan]]. This is a historical, not an official entity, with the boundaries overlapping its western [[Volga]] and eastern [[Siberia]] neighbor regions. At some point in the past, parts of the currently existing Ural region were considered a gateway to Siberia, if not Siberia itself, or were combined with the Volga administrative divisions. Today, there are two official namesake entities, the [[Ural Federal District]] and the [[Ural economic region]]. While the latter follows the historical boundaries, the former is a political product; the District omits Western Urals and includes Western Siberia instead.

The historical center of the Ural is [[Cherdyn, Perm Krai|Cherdyn]], nowadays it is the small town in [[Perm Krai]].
Perm was an administrative center of the [[gubernia]] with the same name by 1797. The most territory of historical and modern Ural was included in Perm gubernia. The administrative center of Urals was moved to Sverdlovsk (nowadays [[Yekaterinburg]]) after Revolution and Civil war. Nowadays Ural economic region does not have an administrative and informal capital, whereas Yekaterinburg is the administrative center of the Ural Federal District.&lt;ref name=ukaz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://base.garant.ru/12119586/|language=Russian|title=Указ Президента РФ от 13 мая 2000 г.

==Etymology==
{{See also|Ural-batyr}}
From the 11th century, the region of the Ural Mountains was called "stone" by Russians. In the mid-16th – early 17th century, the southern parts became known as Ural, which later spread to the entire area. The name probably originated from [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] "aral". This word literally means "island" and was used for any territory different from the surrounding terrain. In [[Bashkortostan]] there is a 13th-century legend about a hero named Ural. He sacrificed his life for the sake of his people, and they poured a stone pile over his grave, which later turned into the Ural Mountains.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

==Topography==
{{See also|Ural Mountains}}
[[File:Iset - view from Three Caves (left).jpg|thumb|Iset River near [[Kamensk-Uralsky]].]]
By topography and other natural features, Ural is divided, from north to south, into the Polar (or Arctic), Near-Polar (or Sub-Arctic), Northern, Central and Southern parts. The Polar Ural has an area of about 25,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a strongly dissected relief. The Near-Polar Ural is wider (up to 150&amp;nbsp;km) and higher than the Polar Ural. The Northern Ural consists of a series of parallel ridges with the height up to 1,000–1,300 m and longitudinal depressions, which are elongated from north to south. The Central Ural is the lowest part of Urals, with the highest mountain of 994 m (Basegi) and a smooth relief. The relief of Southern Ural is more complex, with numerous valleys and ridges directed south-west and meridionally.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

==Geology==
Urals contains 48 species of economically valuable ores and minerals. Eastern regions are rich in [[chalcopyrite]], [[nickel oxide]], [[chromite]] and [[magnetite]] ores, as well as in coal ([[Chelyabinsk Oblast]]), [[bauxite]], [[gold]] and [[platinum]]. Western Ural contains deposits of coal, oil, gas and [[potassium]] salts. The specialty of Urals is precious and semi-precious stones, such as [[emerald]], [[amethyst]], [[Aquamarine (gemstone)|aquamarine]], [[jasper]], [[rhodonite]], [[malachite]] and [[diamond]].&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

==Climate==
The climate of Ural is continental. The ridges of the Ural Mountains are elongated from north to south, they effectively absorb sunlight thereby increasing the temperature. The areas west to the Ural Mountains are 1–2 °C warmer in winter than the eastern regions because the former are warmed by the Atlantic winds whereas the eastern slopes are chilled by the Siberian air masses. The average January temperatures increase in the western areas from –20 °C in the Polar to –15 °C in the Southern Urals and the corresponding temperatures in July are 10 °C and 20 °C. The western areas also received more rainfall than the eastern ones by 150–300&amp;nbsp;mm per year. The highest precipitation (1000&amp;nbsp;mm) is in the Northern Ural that causes the average height of snow up to 90&amp;nbsp;cm. The eastern parts receive from 500–600&amp;nbsp;mm on the north to 300–400&amp;nbsp;mm on the south.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

==Rivers and lakes==
[[File:Maksimovsky rock Chusovaya river.jpg|thumb|Chusovaya River]]
Most Ural rivers belong to the basin of the [[Arctic Ocean]]. They include [[Tobol River|Tobol]], [[Iset River|Iset]], [[Tura River|Tura]], [[Pechora River|Pechora]], [[Lozva River|Lozva]] and [[Severnaya Sosva River]]s. The southern rivers – [[Ural River|Ural]], [[Kama River|Kama]], [[Belaya River (Kama)|Belaya]] and [[Chusovaya River]]s – belong to the [[Caspian Sea]] basin. Western rivers, especially north-western ones, are more affluent. They have high and long (2–3 months) floods in May–June (June–July in the Polar Ural). The south-eastern rivers are much narrower and may dry up in summer. Rivers are fed by melting snow and precipitations. The largest lakes are on the east of the Central and Southern Urals. They include Tawatui, [[Argazi Reservoir|Argazi]], Uvildy and [[Lake Turgoyak|Turgoyak]]. The deepest lake (136 m) is Bolshoe Schuchye. Rivers and lakes are used as a water supply, transport routes and for waterlogging. Some rivers have dams forming the [[Kama Reservoir|Kama]] and [[Votkinsk Reservoir]]s.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

==Flora==
The landscapes of Ural change both in the latitudinal and vertical directions and are dominated by steppes and forests. Steppes lie mostly in the southern and especially south-eastern Urals. Meadow steppes have developed in the lower parts of mountain slopes and are covered with various [[clover]]s, [[Serratula|daisies]], [[filipendula]], [[Poa pratensis|meadow-grass]] and [[foxtail millet]], reaching the height of 60–80&amp;nbsp;cm. Many lands are cultivated. Moving to the south, the meadow steppes become more sparse, dry and low. The steep gravelly slopes of mountains and hills of eastern slopes of the Southern Ural are mostly covered with rocky steppes. Valleys of the rivers contain [[willow]], [[Populus|poplar]] and [[caragana]] shrubs.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;
[[File:Aurora Near Novy Urengoy.jpg|thumb|Aurora in Northern Ural]]
Forest landscapes of Urals are diverse, especially the southern part. The western areas are dominated by dark coniferous taiga forests which change to mixed and deciduous forests on the south. The eastern mountain slopes have light coniferous taiga forests. Southern Ural is most diverse in the forest composition; here together with coniferous forests also abundant are other tree species such as [[larch]], [[oak]], [[birch]], [[maple]] and [[elm]]. The Northern Ural is dominated by Siberian species of [[fir]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[spruce]] and [[pine]]. Forests are much more sparse in [[Polar Ural]]. Whereas in other Ural Mountains areas they grow up to the heights of 1&amp;nbsp;km, the forests cease at 250–400 m in the Polar Urals. The polar forests are low and are mixed with [[swamp]]s, [[lichen]]s, [[bog]]s and shrubs. Abundant are [[Betula nana|dwarf birch]], [[moss]]es and berries ([[blueberry]], [[Rubus chamaemorus|cloudberry]], [[Empetrum nigrum|black crowberry]], etc.).&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

==Fauna==
Ural forests are inhabited by animals typical of [[Siberia]], such as [[elk]], brown [[bear]], [[fox]], [[wolf]], [[wolverine]], [[lynx]], [[squirrel]] and [[sable]] (north only). In the Central Ural, one can meet a rare mixture of [[sable]] and pine [[marten]] named [[kidus]]. In the Southern Ural frequent are [[European badger|badger]] and [[European polecat|black polecat]]. Reptiles and amphibians live mostly in the Southern and Central Ural and are represented by the [[common viper]], lizards and [[Natrix|grass snake]]s. Bird species are represented by [[Western capercaillie|capercaillie]], [[black grouse]], [[hazel grouse]], [[spotted nutcracker]] and cuckoos. In the summer, South and Central Urals are visited by songbirds, such as [[nightingale]] and [[redstart]].&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

Steppes of the Southern Urals are dominated by [[hare]]s and [[rodent]]s such as [[Gopher (animal)|gophers]], [[Spermophilus|susliks]] and [[jerboa]]. There are many birds of prey such as [[lesser kestrel]] and [[buzzard]]s. The animals of the Polar Ural are characteristic of the [[tundra]] and include fox, [[lemming]] and [[reindeer]]. The birds of those areas include [[rough-legged buzzard]], [[snowy owl]] and [[rock ptarmigan]].&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

==Astronomical events==

=== 2013 Russian meteor event ===
At around 9:20 a.m. on Friday, February 15, 2013, an astronomical incident occurred, known as the [[2013 Russian meteor event]]. A fiery meteor, roughly 55 feet wide, weighing at least 10,000 tons and traveling at a speed of 30,000 miles per hour, burst through earth's atmosphere over the Ural Mountains. The news media reported that the meteor's deafening shock wave packed the punch of a 500-kiloton explosion, and was so powerful that it shattered windows and collapsed walls, damaging 4,000 buildings and injuring 1,491 people, the majority of whom were caught in the shards of flying glass. Of the people injured, 311 were children who were at school at the time. Small rocky meteorite fragments were discovered near an eight-metre crater, believed to have been created by the impact, in an ice-covered reservoir near the town of Chebarkul. The overall resulting damage from the shock wave was estimated at $33,000,000.

==History==

The first people appeared on the Ural at the end of the Early Paleolithic period (about 75 thousand years ago). Several sites were discovered from the late Paleolithic (35–10 thousand years ago) including the [[Kapova Cave]]. In the Neolithic period, tribes have formed which became the basis of the Uralic language community, and mixed (Mongoloid, europoid) anthropological type. Around the same time, farming and [[animal husbandry]] develop in the Southern Ural. Manufacture of copper and bronze started in the early 2nd millennium BC and production of iron was developed around the 8th–7th centuries BC.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

[[File:Medezavodmiass.jpg|thumb|Dam of the copper smelter in [[Miass]].]]
At the beginning of the 2nd millennium, the primitive society of Ural started transforming to feudal relations. Around the 14th century, the feudal state [[Great Perm]] was created west to the Northern Ural. Russian started moving to Ural in the 11th century, mostly from the Novgorod areas. They became active around the 14th century when a number of settlements were established in the Northern Ural and attributed to [[Veliky Novgorod]]. Their ownership went to the Moscow state in 1471, together with lands around the [[Kama River]]. After the defeat of [[Khanate of Kazan]] in 1552, the Russian influence expanded to the most parts of [[Bashkortostan]] and [[Udmurtia]].&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

[[File:1910Верх-исетский завод.jpg|thumb|Iset ironworks factory near Yekaterinburg, established in 1726 (photo of 1910).]]
In the 17th century, Ural became inhabited by Slavs who brought advanced farming technique and craftsmanship. This changed the lifestyle of the area and quenches the past armed conflicts. Grain-based agriculture, small-scale industries (wood, leather, pottery, blacksmithing, etc.) and a network of markets spread over Ural. The salt industry was developed in [[Solikamsk]]. At the same time, the national and social oppression started of the indigenous people of the area, such as [[Mansi people|Mansi]], [[Khanty people|Khanty]] and [[Bashkirs]].&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

[[File:Orenburg cossacks with camels.jpg|thumb|Orenburg Cossacks with camels, 19th century.]]
In the 17th century rich and high-quality mineral deposits were discovered in the Ural region. First iron and copper smelters were founded by the mid-17th century. The area was recognized by the Russian government as a strategic source of raw materials. More than 60 factories were built in the first half of the 18th century and this number doubled in the 1750–60s. The industrial activity declined in the early 19th century due to the crisis of the feudal system in Russia, and the growth slowed down in all areas except for the gold mining. The largest industrial and commercial centers were [[Perm]], [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Orenburg]], [[Ufa]], [[Kungur]] and [[Irbit]]. Irbit hosted the biggest fair of the Urals. In the 1840s, regular commercial navigation started on the Kama River.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

[[File:Magnitogorsk steel production facility 1930s.jpg|thumb|[[Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works]] in the 1920s–30s.]]
As a result of the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]], most Ural farmers lost more than half of their personal lands. First joint-stock companies appeared on the Ural in the second half of the 19th century, including those with foreign capital. Many old ironworks were reconstructed and a number of new ones were built. The development accelerated not only in the traditional gold and platinum industries, but also in the coal mining and engineering. Mechanical factories were established in  Yekaterinburg, Perm, [[Izhevsk]] and others cities, and chemical industry was developed in Berezniki. Nevertheless, Ural lost its status of the main metallurgical area to the South of Russia. The end of 19th century saw a rapid growth of the Ural cities and of the anti-capitalist movements. The long-term exploitation of the factory workers resulted in establishment of Social Democratic committees demanding improvements of working conditions. Those activities peaked around the period of the political collapse of the 1910s in Russia. This brought a severe industrial crisis, fuel shortages, disruption of transport, reduction of agricultural production and the deterioration of the life conditions. The [[October Revolution]] brought numerous benefits to the workers, but was followed by the years of Civil Wars (1917–19). The situation improved only after 1920. In 1920–21, the industrial production was at the 12% level of that in 1913, but by 1925–26 it recovered to 93% and in 1937 reached 700%. New giant plants were raised in [[Magnitogorsk]] (1932, iron and steel production), Bereznikovskiy (1932, Chemistry), [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] (1933, Heavy Machinery), [[Chelyabinsk]] (1933, tractors), Solikamsk (1934, [[potassium]]), [[Krasnokamsk]] (1936, pulp and paper), [[Novotagilsk]] (metallurgy) and others. In 1929, oil was discovered in the Kama River basin and its production began in 1932 in Bashkortostan.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

During [[World War II]] (1941–45) Ural became the industrial backbone of Russia as most important industrial enterprises were evacuated there from the western Russia occupied by Germans. From the summer to winter of 1941, 667 factories were moved to Ural and by the end of 1941 Ural accounted for 62% of the Soviet iron production. The Ural's industrial production increased 3 times in 1943 relatively to 1941 and the military production increased 6 times. During the war, Ural accounted for 40% of the Soviet military production. Three Ural's plants gave 66% of Soviet tanks and mobile artillery units. The annual increase of production was about 50%. In 1946, most plants were converted into non-military directions.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

==Ethnic composition==
The Northern Urals is home to [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] speaking people like [[Udmurt people|Udmurts]], [[Mari people|Mari]], [[Komi peoples|Komi]], [[Mansi people|Mansi]] and [[Khanty people]]. The indigenous population of the Polar Urals consists of the [[Nenets people|Nenets]] and [[Samoyedic peoples]] who are widespread through the Siberia and have their own languages. [[Bashkirs]] form the largest indigenous group of the region. They live in the Southern Ural and speak a language of the Turkic group. Kazakhs are another significant national fraction of the Southern Ural. Many northern tribals still continue their traditional activities, including fishing, hunting and animal husbandry (reindeer). The nomadic people of the south used to breed horses, but are mostly settled now and are involved in agriculture, especially growth of wheat, potato, melons and watermelons. The majority of the Urals population (about 80%) is however Russians, who are mostly concentrated in the cities of the Central and Southern Urals and are involved in the industry.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

The table (see also maps above) reveals that the Ural Federal District and Ural economical region are rather different entities, which geographically differ from the Urals, even though the Urals is not well defined geographically. In particular, those entities include parts of Volga and Siberia, and do not include areas belonging to [[Kazakhstan]]. Meanwhile, the southern part of the Ural Mountains (including [[Mugodzhar Hills|Mugodzhar Mountains]]) does belong to Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/619028/Ural-Mountains Ural Mountains], Encyclopædia Britannica on-line&lt;/ref&gt;
