      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13546">[[File:Three point shoot.JPG|thumb|Basketball players in uniform during the [[FIBA]] Europe Cup Women Finals 2005]]
A '''basketball uniform''' is a type of [[uniform]] worn by [[basketball]] players. Basketball uniforms consist of a [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] that features the number and last name of the player on the back, as well as [[shorts]] and [[athletic shoes]]. Within teams, players wear uniforms representing the team colors; the home team typically wears a lighter-colored uniform, while the visiting team wears a darker-colored uniform.

Different basketball leagues have different specifications for the type of uniform that is allowed on the court. Early in the history of the sport, basketball was played in any type of athletic attire, but by the 1900s, special uniforms were developed and marketed to basketball players. The style, cut, and fit of basketball uniforms evolved throughout subsequent decades, often modeled after the general fashion trends of the day.

==History==
===Jerseys and shorts===
[[File:Kansas U team 1899.jpg|thumb|The 1899 University of Kansas basketball team, demonstrating uniforms of sleeveless jerseys and long pants]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Munich 1972.jpg|thumb|Yugoslavia playing Czechoslovakia in the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]; the players wear short, tight-fitting uniforms typical of the 1970s]] --&gt;
[[File:Carmelo Anthony Nuggets.jpg|thumb|[[Carmelo Anthony]] wearing a modern-day NBA uniform, headband and arm bands as accessories]]
Originally, basketball was played in any type of athletic attire, ranging from [[track suit]]s to [[American football|football]] uniforms. The first official basketball uniforms, as displayed in the [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] catalog of 1901, featured three types of pants: knee-length padded pants, similar to those worn for playing football, as well as shorter pants and knee-length tights. There were two types of suggested jersey, a quarter-length sleeve and a sleeveless version.&lt;ref name="Naismith1941"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Naismith|title=Basketball: Its Origin and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDKtaGdhZncC&amp;pg=PA89|year=1941|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-8370-9|pages=89-90}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The long pants later evolved into medium-length shorts in the 1920s, and by the 1930s, the material used for jerseys changed from heavy [[wool]] to the lighter [[polyester]] and [[nylon]]. In the 1970s and 80s, uniforms became tighter-fitting and shorts were shorter, consistent with the overall fashion trends of these two decades.&lt;ref name="Raatma2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucia Raatma|title=The Curious, Captivating, Unusual History of Sports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6om9avhJfoC&amp;pg=PA13|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Capstone Press|isbn=978-1-4296-7537-6|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, women's basketball uniforms transitioned from longer-sleeved uniforms to [[Sleeveless shirt|tank-top]] style jerseys similar to men's basketball uniforms, which more explicitly showed off players' muscle tone.&lt;ref name="McCullough2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah McCullough|title=Construction of the Female Athletic Body: A Study of Women's Sport Uniforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojp42Q-ihI4C&amp;pg=PA76|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-26375-3|pages=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, [[Michael Jordan]] asked for longer shorts and helped popularize the move away from tight, short shorts toward the longer, baggier shorts worn by basketball players today.&lt;ref name="LeBoutillier2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nate LeBoutillier|title=The Best of Everything Basketball Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9mlMwWQqJgC&amp;pg=PA59|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-5468-5|pages=58-59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slade2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Suzanne Slade|title=The Technology of Basketball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=otgFCniq8tsC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-9956-3|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1990s, basketball uniforms fell under the influence of [[hip hop]] culture, with shorts becoming longer and looser-fitting, team colors brighter, and designs more flashy and suggestive of rappers' [[bling]].&lt;ref name="Lane2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Lane|title=Under the Boards: The Cultural Revolution in Basketball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqEfWSh17IwC&amp;pg=PA74|date=1 December 2007|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-0755-7|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 21st century, basketball uniforms became even more oversized and loose-fitting; the arm holes in women's basketball jerseys remained smaller than men's, but were wide enough to reveal the players' [[sports bra]]s.&lt;ref name="McCullough2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah McCullough|title=Construction of the Female Athletic Body: A Study of Women's Sport Uniforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojp42Q-ihI4C&amp;pg=PA76|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-26375-3|pages=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John Wall (Celtics at Wizards 1-24-17).jpg|thumb|right|[[Jae Crowder]] and [[John Wall (basketball)|John Wall]] wearing the newly introduced sleeved basketball jerseys]]

====Sleeved jersey====
For the Christmas Day games of 2013, the NBA and its apparel partner [[Adidas]] introduced a newly designed sleeved jersey with large team and NBA logos on the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patt|first=Jason|title=NBA Christmas Day uniforms 2013: Teams to wear new sleeved jerseys|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/12/25/5243450/2013-nba-christmas-jerseys|work=SBNation|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketers for the new uniforms realized that fans were unwilling to wear sleeveless jerseys in their day-to-day life and hoped the new sleeved jerseys would be more popular for everyday wear.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web|last=Holmes|first=Elizabeth|title=NBA Christmas Jerseys—Now With Sleeves|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304243904579195860755097586|work=WSJ Online|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also a "not-so-well-kept secret that the NBA wanted to implement jersey ads in the years following the introduction of sleeved jerseys" as the "sleeves allow more space for potential partners to add their corporate logos to jerseys" like association football (soccer). After the league deal with Adidas expired and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] signed on as the new apparel partner, the sleeved jersey did not continue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/10/6/16203076/nba-sleeved-jerseys-nike-lebron-james]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sleeved jersey was controversial among players.  LeBron James famously ripped the sleeves off during a prime time game against the [[New York Knicks]] in 2015, but in the [[2016 NBA Finals]] James convinced his teammates to wear the sleeved jerseys in Game 5 and again in the title-clinching Game 7.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/10/6/16203076/nba-sleeved-jerseys-nike-lebron-james]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CavsAltUnis2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cavs Unveil Three New Alternate Uniforms for 2015-16 Season|url=http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/news/releases/jersey-announcement-151021|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com/Cavaliers|date=October 21, 2015|accessdate=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/nba/2016/06/19/nba-finals-game-7-cavs-black-sleeved-jerseys-warriors|title=Cavs wearing sleeved jerseys in Game 7|last=|first=|date=19 June 2016|work=SI.com|access-date=2017-06-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2017/06/cavaliers_wearing_black_jersey.html|title=Cavaliers wearing black jerseys for Game 2: 2017 NBA Finals|last=Vardon|first=Joe|date=4 June 2017|work=cleveland.com|access-date=2017-06-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CavaliersLogoSuite"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cavaliers Logo Suite Evolves to Modernize Look|url=http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/releases/updated-logo-170531|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com/Cavaliers|date=May 31, 2017|accessdate=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/look-cavs-unveil-new-logos-add-black-to-color-scheme-before-start-of-nba-finals/|title=LOOK: Cavs unveil new logos, add black to color scheme before start of NBA Finals|last=Boone|first=Kyle|date=1 June 2017|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=2017-06-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shoes===
In 1903, a special basketball shoe with suction cups to prevent slippage was added to the official basketball uniform demonstrated in the Spalding catalog.&lt;ref name="Naismith1941"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Naismith|title=Basketball: Its Origin and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDKtaGdhZncC&amp;pg=PA89|year=1941|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-8370-9|pages=89-90}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Over the decades, different shoe brands and styles were popular as basketball shoes: [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]] and [[Keds]] in the 1960s and 70s; [[Adidas]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] leather [[high-tops]] in the late 1970s and 80s; and [[Air Jordans]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="LeBoutillier2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nate LeBoutillier|title=The Best of Everything Basketball Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9mlMwWQqJgC&amp;pg=PA59|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-5468-5|pages=58-59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessories===
In the 1970s, [[Slick Watts]] and [[Bill Walton]] began to wear headbands, which soon became popular with other players. [[Rick Barry]] popularized wrist-bands, and other players soon created variations, such as bands that covered their forearms or biceps. These were used to wipe off sweat, or simply worn as fashion statements.&lt;ref name="LeBoutillier2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nate LeBoutillier|title=The Best of Everything Basketball Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9mlMwWQqJgC&amp;pg=PA59|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-5468-5|pages=58-59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern day==
===United States basketball===
====Rules and regulations====
In professional basketball leagues today, teams playing at home typically wear lighter-colored uniforms than the visiting team.&lt;ref name="HarariOminsky2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=P. J. Harari|author2=Dave Ominsky|title=Basketball Made Simple: A Spectator's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtNDH_pR990C&amp;pg=PA10|date=1 October 2002|publisher=First Base Sports, Inc.|isbn=978-1-884309-13-7|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the {{nbay|2017|app=season}}, the NBA has eliminated the distinction between designated "home" and "away" uniforms. The home team is now allowed to wear any uniform color it chooses, while its opponent may wear any color that sufficiently contrasts with the home team's choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Whitaker |first1=Lang |title=NBA, Nike unveil new uniforms for 2017-18 season |url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/07/18/nba-nike-new-uniforms |website=NBA.com |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |date=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[NBA]], basketball shorts must fall at least 1 inch above the knee, and [[T-shirts]] cannot be worn under the jersey &amp;ndash; however, they are permitted in American [[college basketball]]. Some NBA and [[WNBA]] teams have allowed sponsors' logos to appear on their uniforms.&lt;ref name=nytWNBA&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=In W.N.B.A., Jersey Sponsorship Could Set New Standard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/sports/basketball/01wnba.html?_r=0|accessdate=25 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Material====
Uniforms are made of [[wicking]] material designed to absorb sweat and ensure that it evaporates faster.&lt;ref name="Raatma2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucia Raatma|title=The Curious, Captivating, Unusual History of Sports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6om9avhJfoC&amp;pg=PA13|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Capstone Press|isbn=978-1-4296-7537-6|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the product of a four-year study researching professional basketball players, who identified the need for fewer seams, lighter weight, and faster drying and cooling in their jerseys.&lt;ref name="Slade2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Suzanne Slade|title=The Technology of Basketball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=otgFCniq8tsC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-9956-3|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International basketball leagues===
The main difference between U.S. basketball uniforms and those of other countries is the appearance of sponsorship iconography; European basketball uniforms are often covered in the logos of their sponsors (similar to association football), while the U.S. uniforms (like other major pro sports) feature the team wordmark/logo front and center.&lt;ref name=bleacherreport&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Dan|title=NBA Debate: Should the NBA Put Advertisements on Jerseys?|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1124800-nba-debate-should-the-nba-put-advertisements-on-jerseys|work=The Bleacher Report|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the 2017-18 season, some U.S. teams have started putting sponsorship logos on their jerseys on the upper left of the jersey which is a maximum of 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/26/16036162/nba-jersey-patch-sponsor-tracker-2017-season]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Background===
{{see also|Bids for the 1996 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Olympics bids|2002 Commonwealth Games}}
Plans to build a new stadium in Manchester were formulated before 1989 as part of the city's bid to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. Manchester City Council submitted a bid that included a design for an 80,000-capacity stadium on a [[greenfield land|greenfield]] site west of Manchester city centre. The bid failed and [[Atlanta]] hosted the Games. Four years later the city council bid to host the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], but this time focusing on a [[brownfield land|brownfield]] site {{convert|1.6|km}} east of the city centre on derelict land that was the site of [[Bradford Colliery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxfordarchaeology.com/professional-services/case-studies/28-archaeology-urban-development/101-archaeology-eastlands-manchester |title=Project: Eastlands' industrial past |work=oxford archaeology: exploring the human journey |publisher=Oxford Archaeology |year=2010 |accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; known colloquially as Eastlands. The council's shift in focus was driven by emerging government legislation on [[urban renewal]], promising vital support funding for such projects; the government became involved in funding the purchase and clearance of the Eastlands site in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.arup.com/_assets/_download/download71.pdf |title=Designing the City of Manchester Stadium |format=PDF |journal=The Arup Journal |publisher=Arup Associates |date=January 2003 |accessdate=14 June 2015 |quote=... emerging government legislation on urban renewal, which promised vital support funding and had implications for the final site of the proposed venue. Government became involved in funding the purchase and clearance of the Eastlands site in 1992. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327124708/http://www.arup.com/_assets/_download/download71.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the February 1993 bid the city council submitted another 80,000-capacity stadium design&lt;ref name="orig design"/&gt; produced by design consultants [[Arup Group|Arup Associates]], the firm that helped select the Eastlands site. On 23 September 1993, the games were awarded to Sydney, but the following year Manchester submitted the same scheme design to the [[Millennium Commission]] as a "Millennium Stadium", only to have this proposal rejected. Undeterred, Manchester City Council subsequently bid to host the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]], once again proposing the same site along with downsized stadium plans derived from the 2000 Olympics bid, and this time were successful. In 1996, this same planned stadium competed with [[Wembley Stadium]] to gain funding to become the new [[national stadium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/city-of-manchester-stadium-the-wembley-rescuers-1132001.html |title=City of Manchester Stadium: The Wembley rescuers |last=Hubbard |first=Alan |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |location=London |date=12 December 1999 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |quote=Manchester, who lost out to Wembley in the bitter battle to become England's national stadium because the Football Association did not want to look north ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the money was used to redevelop Wembley.

After successful athletics events at the Commonwealth Games, conversion into a football venue was criticised by athletics figures such as [[Jonathan Edwards (triple jumper)|Jonathan Edwards]] and [[Sebastian Coe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/commonwealthgames2002/hi/features/newsid_2164000/2164264.stm|title=Athletics' stadium claim is pipe dream|last=Bonnet|first=Rob|work=BBC Sport|date=31 July 2002|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as, at the time, the United Kingdom still lacked plans for a large athletics venue due to the capability of installing an athletics track having been dropped from the designs for a rebuilt Wembley Stadium. Had either of the two larger stadium proposals developed by Arup been agreed for funding, then Manchester would have had a venue capable of being adapted to hosting large-scale athletics events through the use of [[movable seating]].

Sport England wished to avoid creating a [[white elephant]], so they insisted that the City Council agree to undertake and fund extensive work to convert ''CoMS'' from a track and field arena to a football stadium, thereby ensuring its long-term financial viability. Sport England hoped either Manchester City Council or Manchester City F.C. would provide the extra £50 million required to convert the stadium to a 65,000 seater athletics and footballing venue with movable seating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/city-of-manchester-stadium-the-wembley-rescuers-1132001.html |title=City of Manchester Stadium: The Wembley rescuers |last=Hubbard |first=Alan |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |location=London |date=12 December 1999 |accessdate=7 January 2008 |quote=It is estimated that making the stadium permanently suitable for track and field events would add another pounds 50m to the cost}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Manchester City Council did not have the money to facilitate movable seating and Manchester City were lukewarm about the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/city-of-manchester-stadium-the-wembley-rescuers-1132001.html |title=City of Manchester Stadium: The Wembley rescuers |last=Hubbard |first=Alan |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |location=London |date=12 December 1999 |accessdate=7 January 2008 |quote=But council sources say they are confident that the football club could be persuaded to allow the track to remain as a permanent feature with a retractable seating scheme, such as that in Paris's Stade de France which would further increase the capacity to 65,000.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stadium architects Arup Sport believed history demonstrated that maintaining a rarely used athletics track often does not work with football – and cited examples such as the [[Stadio delle Alpi]] and the [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympic Stadium]] with both [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] moving to new stadiums less than 40 years after inheriting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/nov/07/stadiumisnowhiteelephantb |title=Stadium is no white elephant but future is just a guess |last=Patel |first=Dipesh |newspaper=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=London |date=7 November 2007 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stadium expansion===

Media|date=2 September 2008|accessdate=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester City signed an agreement with Manchester City Council in March 2010 to allow a £1 billion redevelopment led by architect [[Rafael Viñoly]].&lt;ref name="Viñoly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/news/manchester-city-fc-submits-plans-for-etihad-campus/ |title=Manchester City FC submits plans for Etihad Campus |work=placenorthwest.co.uk |publisher=Place North West |location=Manchester |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010 closed season the football pitch and hospitality areas were renovated, with a £1 million investment being made in the playing surface so that it is better able to tolerate concerts and other events without damage.&lt;ref name="upgrade"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10183705 |title=Manchester City in £1.5m corporate facilities upgrade |work=BBC News |location=Manchester |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, Manchester City renegotiated the stadium lease, obtaining the naming rights to the stadium in return for agreeing to now pay the City Council an annual fixed sum of  £3&amp;nbsp;million where previously it had only paid half of the ticket sales revenue from match attendances exceeding 35,000.&lt;ref name="new lease"/&gt; This new agreement occurred as part of a standard five-year review of the original lease and it amounts to an approximate £1&amp;nbsp;million annual increase in council revenues from the stadium.&lt;ref name="new lease"&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City give council an extra £1m |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1338690_manchester_city_give_council_an_extra_1m |last=Keegan |first=Mike |work=Manchester Evening News |publisher=M.E.N.

During 2011–14, the club sold all 36,000 of its allocated season tickets each season&lt;ref name="season tickets"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2011/08/15/Franchises/Arsenal-EPL-side.aspx |title=Key business issues facing EPL franchises |work=SportsBusiness Journal |publisher=Street and Smith's Sports Group |date=15–21 August 2011 |accessdate=21 November 2011 |quote=The club sells 36,000 season tickets annually.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and experienced an average match attendance that is very close to its maximum seating capacity (see table in previous section). Consequently, during the 2014–15 season, an expansion of the stadium was undertaken. The South Stand was extended with the addition of a third tier which, in conjunction with an additional three rows of pitch side seating, increased stadium capacity to approximately 55,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Man City's soaring new stand to boost Etihad atmosphere  |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/pictured-man-citys-soaring-new-8900745 |publisher=Manchester Evening News |last=Brennan |first=Stuart |date=23 March 2015 |accessdate=2 June 2015 |quote=... which will take the stadium capacity over 55,000, making it the third biggest club ground in the country after Old Trafford and Arsenal's Emirates Stadium.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction commenced on the South Stand in April 2014 and was completed for the start of the 2015–16 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man City's soaring new stand to boost Etihad atmosphere  |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/pictured-man-citys-soaring-new-8900745 |publisher=Manchester Evening News |last=Brennan |first=Stuart |date=23 March 2015 |accessdate=2 June 2015 |quote=Manchester City's new, expanded South Stand is nearing completion and is pencilled in for an autumn opening.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final phase of expansion, that received planning approval at the same time as the others but which remains unscheduled, will add a matching third tier of seats to the North Stand. Once this last phase is completed it will bring the stadium's total seating capacity up to approximately 61,000, making the Etihad Stadium the nation's third largest capacity club ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcfc.com/The-Club/Stadium-Expansion/Expansion-Process |title=The stadium expansion |work=MCFC OWS |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |accessdate=2 June 2015 |quote=If this phase is completed, there will be another 6,000 additional seats, taking the stadium’s capacity to approximately 61,000, making the Etihad the second largest stadium in the Premier League.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When planning the development, Manchester City Council required a sustainable landmark structure that would be an icon for the regeneration of the once heavily industrialised site surrounding Bradford Colliery, as well as providing spectators with good sightlines in an atmospheric arena.&lt;ref name="transform"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.arup.com/_assets/_download/download153.PDF |title=Transforming the City of Manchester Stadium |format=PDF |journal=The Arup Journal |publisher=Arup Associates |date=February 2003 |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330074151/http://www.arup.com/_assets/_download/download153.PDF |archivedate=30 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arup Associates designed the stadium to be "an intimate, even intimidating, gladiatorial arena embodying the atmosphere of a football club" with the pitch six metres below ground level, a feature of Roman gladiatorial arenas and [[amphitheatre]]s.&lt;ref name="transform"/&gt; The attention to detail, often absent in stadium design, has been remarked upon, including the cigar-shaped roof supports with blue lighting beacons, sculpted rainwater gutters, poly-carbonate perimeter roof edging and openable louvres to aid pitch grass growth with similarities also made to [[high-tech architecture]].&lt;ref name="questionofsport"/&gt;

===Iconic roof design===
The [[Toroid (geometry)|toroidal]]-shaped stadium roof is held together by a tensioned system, which has been described as "ground-breaking" by ''[[British Constructional Steelwork Association|New Steel Construction]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="tension"/&gt; The stadium's architectural focal point is the sweeping roof and support masts which are separate from the concrete bowl.&lt;ref name="tension"/&gt; A catenary cable is situated around the inner perimeter of the roof structure which is tied to the masts via forestay cables. Backstay cables and corner ties from the masts are connected to the ground to support the structure.&lt;ref name="tension"/&gt; With the expansion of the South Stand in 2015 to accommodate a third tier of seating, the original south end roof was dismantled; but with the southern masts and corner ties remaining, so as to continue to tie the catenary cable which now runs below the new roof.  The new higher South Stand roof is a separate structure, with its own set of braced masts and cables; and it is expected that a counterpart arrangement will be adopted for the proposed North Stand expansion.

Cables are attached to the twelve masts circling the stadium with rafters and [[purlins]] for additional rigid support.&lt;ref name="tension"/&gt; The cigar-shaped masts double as visual features, with the highest at {{convert|70|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msc.aisc.org/globalassets/modern-steel/archives/2003/12/2003v12_building_tension.pdf |title=Building Tension |format=PDF |first=Martin &amp; King, Mike |last=Simpson |work=msc.aisc.org |publisher=Modern Steel Construction |date=December 2003 |accessdate=11 June 2015 |quote=The most visible features of the stadium are the 12 perimeter masts that rise as high as 70 m (230’) into the air.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the upper tiers of seats is provided by eight circular ramps with conical roofs resembling turrets above which eight of the twelve masts rise up providing the support structure for the roof.&lt;ref name="ArupAwards"/&gt;

The roof of the south, east and west stands built for the athletics stadium configuration was supported by the cable net system. The temporary open stand at the north end was built around the masts and tie down cables that would ultimately support the roof of the North Stand.&lt;ref name="tension"/&gt; After the games the track and field were excavated. The temporary bleachers at the north end were removed and the North Stand and lower tier of seats constructed on the prepared excavation. The North Stand roof was completed by adding rafters, purlins and cladding.&lt;ref name="tension"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msc.aisc.org/globalassets/modern-steel/archives/2003/12/2003v12_building_tension.pdf |title=Building Tension |format=PDF |first=Martin &amp; King, Mike |last=Simpson |work=msc.aisc.org |publisher=Modern Steel Construction |date=December 2003 |accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilities and pitch===
The stadium has facilities for players and match officials in a basement area below the west stand, which also contains a kitchen providing meals for up to 6,000 people on match days, press rooms, ground staff storage, and a prison cell.&lt;ref name="transform"/&gt; The stadium also has conference facilities and is licensed for [[Civil marriage|marriage ceremonies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countybrides.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/16_Wedding-Booklet_Screen.pdf |title=Borrowed &amp; Blue – Weddings at the City of Manchester Stadium |format=PDF |work=countybrides.com |publisher=CoMS Conference &amp; Events / Manchester City Football Club |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitting out of the hospitality suites, kitchens, offices, and concourse concessions was accomplished by [[KSS Design Group|KSS Architects]], and included the installation of the communications cabling and automatic access control system.&lt;ref name="transform"/&gt;

The stadium's interior comprises a continuous oval bowl, with three tiers of seating at the sides, and two tiers at each end. Entry by patrons is gained by [[contactless smart card]] rather than traditional manned [[turnstile]]s. The system can admit up to 1,200 people per minute through all entrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://h71028.www7.hp.com/ERC/downloads/5982-4314EN.pdf |title=Manchester City kicks off innovative smartcard services and sponsorships with wireless, RF-enabled Intelligent Stadium |format=PDF |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |date=February 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209195715/http://h71028.www7.hp.com/ERC/downloads/5982-4314EN.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2006 |accessdate=27 August 2006 |quote=The contact-free solution admits up to 1,200 patrons per minute stadium-wide and also eliminates box-office queues.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A service tunnel under the stadium provides access for emergency vehicles and the visiting team's [[coach (vehicle)|coach]] to enter the stadium directly.

The stadium was named the City of Manchester Stadium by Manchester City Council before construction began in December 1999,&lt;ref name="foundation stone"/&gt; but has a number of commonly used alternatives. City of Manchester Stadium is abbreviated to CoMS when written and spoken. Eastlands refers to the site and the stadium before they were named SportCity and CoMS respectively, and remains in common usage&lt;ref name="renaming" /&gt; for both the stadium and the whole complex, as does SportCity but with less frequency.&lt;ref name="all 4 names"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/p/227642|title=Why Blues must cash in on name game|last=Bailey|first=Chris|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|publisher=M.E.N.

The football club, under its new ownership, renegotiated its 250-year lease with the city council in October 2010, gaining the naming rights&lt;ref name="naming rights"/&gt; in return for a substantial increase in rent.&lt;ref name="doubled rent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="new lease"/&gt; The stadium was renamed the Etihad Stadium by the club in July 2011 as part of a ten-year agreement with the team kit sponsors [[Etihad Airways]].&lt;ref name="renaming"/&gt; The agreement encompasses sponsorship of the stadium's name,&lt;ref name="Manchester City Football Club"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mancity.com/citytv/behind-the-scenes/2011/07/08/city-and-etihad-an-historic-day-for-the-club/1447543781380 |title=City and Etihad: An histotic day for the club|format=web video|publisher=Manchester City Football Club|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; extends the team kit sponsorship for ten years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jul/08/manchester-city-stadium-etihad-airways|title=Manchester City confirm stadium renaming in Etihad Airways agreement|last=Gardner|first=Alan|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes plans to relocate the club's youth academy and training facilities to the City Football Academy&lt;ref name="CFA"/&gt; on a new campus development adjacent to the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/8729541/Manchester-City-taken-to-a-whole-new-level-with-Sheikh-Mansours-1-billion-investment.html |title=Manchester City taken to a whole new level with Sheikh Mansour's £1&amp;nbsp;billion investment |last=Ogden |first=Mark |newspaper=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |location=London |date=29 August 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2011 |quote=The deal covers stadium-naming rights, shirt sponsorship and the area surrounding the ground which is now known as Etihad Campus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a continuous oval bowl, each side of the stadium is named in the manner of a traditional football ground. All sides were initially named by compass direction (North Stand and South Stand for the ends, East Stand and West Stand for the sides).&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City&amp;nbsp;– The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon Books Publishing |location=Derby |date=Jan 2006 |isbn=978-1-85983-512-8 |pages=103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2004, after a vote by fans, the West Stand was renamed the [[Colin Bell]] Stand in honour of the former player.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_city/s/72/72911_city_stand_by_bell.html |title=City stand by Bell |last=Spencer |first=Pete |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |publisher=M.E.N. Media |date=13 November 2003 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote was almost cancelled (and the stand instead named after [[Joe Mercer]]) due to suspicions it had been hijacked by rival fans who wished to dub the renamed stand The Bell End. However, core supporters of the club made it clear they still wished the stand named after their hero.&lt;ref name="Bell"/&gt; The East Stand is unofficially known by fans as [[the Kippax]] as a tribute to the very vocal east stand at the club's [[Maine Road]] ground.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THE LIST: 20–11 of the most atmospheric stadiums in football |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-1101379/THE-LIST-20-11-atmospheric-stadiums-football.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=24 December 2008 |accessdate=20 June 2015 |quote=Maine Road will always be one of English football's legendary grounds.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Stand is the only part of the stadium built after the Commonwealth Games, during the stadium's conversion. The temporary unroofed north stand it replaced had been dubbed the New Gene Kelly Stand by supporters, a reference to the unroofed corner between the Kippax and the North Stand at the club's former Maine Road home, because, being exposed to the elements, they frequently found themselves "singing in the rain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bluemoon-mcfc.co.uk/Club/TheEtihadStadium.aspx |title=The Etihad Stadium |work=Bluemoon (bluemoon-mcfc.co.uk) |publisher=Bluemoon-MCFC |location=Manchester |first=Gary &amp; Turner, Ric |last=James |accessdate=17 June 2015 |quote=At the northern end a large temporary uncovered structure – the new Gene Kelly Stand as City attendees at the Games dubbed it – filled the end where the running track curved beyond the boundaries of a regular football pitch.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commencing season 2010–11, seating in the North Stand has been restricted to only supporters accompanied by children, resulting in this end of the ground now being commonly referred to as the Family Stand.

Supporters initially dubbed the South Stand the Scoreboard End (the former name of the North Stand at Maine Road), and it houses the majority of City's more vocal fans. Supporters of visiting teams are also normally allocated seats in this stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bluemoon-mcfc.co.uk/Club/TheEtihadStadium.aspx |title=The Etihad Stadium |work=Bluemoon (bluemoon-mcfc.co.uk) |publisher=Bluemoon-MCFC |location=Manchester |first=Gary &amp; Turner, Ric |last=James |accessdate=17 June 2015 |quote=THE SOUTH STAND (originally referred to as the Scoreboard End): Converted into a tier two stand after the Games, this end houses the Legends Lounge, away supporters and City’s more vocal fans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2006, it was renamed the [[Key 103]] Stand for sponsorship reasons, though this was largely ignored by regular patrons.

The stadium is the centrepiece of [[Sportcity|SportCity]], which includes several other nationally important sporting venues. Adjacent to the stadium is the [[Manchester Regional Arena]], which served as a warm-up track during the Commonwealth Games and is now a 6,178-capacity venue that hosts national athletics trials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |title=Played in Manchester |publisher=English Heritage |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=1-873592-78-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has previously also hosted the home games of both the Manchester City [[Manchester City W.F.C.|women's team]] and the club's [[Manchester City F.C.

The Regional Arena has regularly hosted the [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA Championships]] and [[Paralympic World Cup]], and is currently the home ground of amateur rugby league side Manchester Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loverugbyleague.com/news_17164-manchester-rangers-hint-at-professional-future-after-eastlands-move.html |title=Manchester Rangers hint at professional future after Eastlands move |work=loverugbyleague.com |publisher=Love Rugby League |date=25 February 2015 |accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Squash Centre]] and the [[National Cycling Centre]], which includes both the [[Manchester Velodrome]] and the [[National Indoor BMX Arena]], are all a short distance from the stadium. The Squash Centre, which has hosted the [[British National Squash Championships]] since 2003 was added to the SportCity complex for the Commonwealth Games along with CoMS. The Velodrome, another showpiece venue used to stage all the [[track cycling]] events for the Games, was already in place and had been home to [[British Cycling]], the governing body for cycling in Britain, since it was built in 1994,&lt;ref name="cycling"/&gt; as part of Manchester’s unsuccessful 2000 Olympics bid.&lt;ref name="2000 bid"/&gt; Prior to the completion of the [[Lee Valley VeloPark]] for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Velodrome had been the only indoor Olympic-standard track in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="2000 bid"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/fast-track-to-glory-how-manchester-692611 |title=Fast track to glory: How Manchester Velodrome forged Britain’s Olympic gold rush |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |publisher=M.E.N.

Between 11 March (Commonwealth Day) and 10 August 2002, as part of the preparations for the upcoming Commonwealth Games and to celebrate Her Majesty the Queen's Golden Jubilee, a national Spirit of Friendship Festival was organised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/2002/festival/events.shtml |title=Spirit of Friendship Festival Events |work=BBC News |date=March 2002 |accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July, a few weeks before the Games began, a sculpture outside the new national headquarters of the English Institute of Sport at SportCity was unveiled by the middle-distance runner [[Steve Cram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/2002/news/072002/10/sculpture.shtml |title='The Runner' Unveiled |work=BBC News |date=10 July 2002 |accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sculpture, commissioned in late 2001, was created in a little over eight weeks by Altrincham-based artist, Colin Spofforth, who had submitted to Manchester City Council his idea for a heroic-sized sculpture of a sprinter as a means of celebrating the beauty, power and determination of the competing athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colinspofforth.com/the_runner.htm |title=Figurative Sculpture – The Runner |work=colinspofforth.com |publisher=Colin Spofforth Studio |date= |accessdate=24 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120646/http://www.colinspofforth.com/the_runner.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaching thirty feet high, weighing seven tonnes, and titled ''The Runner'', this unique larger-than-life bronze statue of a male sprinter surmounting a bronze globe was, at the time, the United Kingdom's largest sporting sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m2002.thecgf.com/Games_News/News/default.asp?id=213 |title=30ft bronze sculpture unveiled by Steve Cram |work=m2002.thecgf.com |publisher=Commonwealth Games Federation |date=9 July 2002 |accessdate=24 June 2015 |quote=The sculpture is 30 feet high and weighs seven tonnes making it the largest bronze sculpture dedicated to sport in the United Kingdom.

From 2005 to 2009 a [[Thomas Heatherwick]] sculpture, ''[[B of the Bang]]'', was situated to the southeast of the stadium at the junction of Ashton New Road and Alan Turing Way.

This order of magnitude mismatch between the numbers of traveling fans and those holding tickets ultimately led to a serious [[2008 UEFA Cup Final riots|public disorder incident]] in the centre of the city now inextricably associated with this final, despite the fact that the 44,000 or so crowd who watched the game inside the stadium were perfectly well-behaved.&lt;ref name="MCC riot report"/&gt;

In 2003, initial reception by Manchester City supporters was polarised, with some lukewarm about moving from [[Maine Road]] which had a reputation for being one of English football's most atmospheric grounds, whilst others were enthusiastic about the bigger stadium and move back to East Manchester where the club was formed.

In the early years of Manchester City's tenure, the stadium suffered from a poor atmosphere, a common problem with modern stadia when compared with traditional football grounds such as Maine Road.

In October 2004, the stadium played host to a [[rugby league]] international match between [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] in the [[2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations|Tri-Nations]] series in front of nearly 40,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/Tri-Nations_2004/Game_3/Great_Britain-vs-Australia.html|title=Rugby League Project – Great Britain vs. Australia|publisher=Rugby League Project|date=30 October 2004|accessdate=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a record attendance in 2012 – both for a single day (32,953) and the aggregate for the whole weekend (63,716) – the Etihad Stadium became the venue of choice for this annual rugby league event, setting another attendance record (36,339 / 64,552) for it in May 2014. However, the current construction work involved with the expansion of the South Stand caused this competition to be relocated to [[St. James' Park]] for the summer of 2015, but it is expected to return to the Etihad again once the expansion work is complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/2015-magic-weekend-not-coming-7365141 |title=Magic Weekend not coming to Etihad Stadium |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |publisher=M.E.N.

The '''Ciudad del Motor de Aragón''', also known as '''Motorland Aragón''', is a {{convert|5.344|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[motorsport]] [[race track]] located in [[Alcañiz]], [[Spain]].

The circuit has been designed by well-known [[Germany|German]] [[architect]] [[Hermann Tilke]] in conjunction with the [[United Kingdom|British]] architectural firm [[Foster and Partners|Foster + Partners]]. [[Formula One]] driver and [[Ferrari]] [[test driver]] [[Pedro de la Rosa]] was a technical and sporting consultant on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.motorlandaragon.com/pagEstatica.aspx?id=7 | title = Work team | publisher = motorlandaragon.com | date =  | accessdate = 2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility has been designed to incorporate three main zones – a technology park, a sports area and a [[leisure]] and culture area. The technology park will feature research and educational institutes related to the [[Automotive industry|motor industry]], the sports area will include the racing circuit (with multiple layouts), a [[karting]] track and various gravel circuits, whilst the leisure and culture section will feature a hotel, business centre and shopping facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.motorlandaragon.com/pagEstatica.aspx?id=2 | title = CIRCUITS &amp; AREAS | publisher = motorlandaragon.com | date =  | accessdate = 2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Formul'Academy Euroseries 2009. Motorland Aragón.jpg|thumb|left|230px|A race in the [[F4 Eurocup 1.6|Formul'Academy Euro Series]] at Ciudad del Motor de Aragón (2009)]]
It was announced on 26 May 2008 that the circuit will host a round of the [[World Series by Renault]] in [[2009 World Series by Renault season|2009]], the first international championship to race at the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/67790 | title = Motorland Aragon to host race in '09 | publisher = autosport.com | date = 2008-05-27 | accessdate = 2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.italiaracing.net/notizia.asp?id=19271&amp;cat=5 | title = Motorland Aragón to host WSR in 2009 and 2010 | publisher = italiaracing.net | date = 2008-05-26 | accessdate = 2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has returned to Aragón every year since, until the end of the championship in 2015. [[Renault Sport|Renault Sport Technologies]] had access to the circuit for thirty days per year for testing and promotional events. When the [[World Series by Renault]] championship was discontinued at the end of 2015 and was relaunched in [[2016 Formula V8 3.5 Series|2016]] as [[Formula V8 3.5]], the circuit continued to be part of the schedule. The race remained on the championship for the [[2017 World Series Formula V8 3.5|2017]] season, at the end of which the championship was discontinued.

On 18 March 2010, Motorland Aragón was announced as a replacement for the [[Balatonring]] on the 2010 [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]] calendar. Aragón was already in place as a reserve event and replaces the Hungarian race which was postponed because of overrunning construction work. This made the [[Aragon motorcycle Grand Prix]] the fourth Spanish race on the calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2010/Replacement+of+the+Hungarian+Grand+Prix+0 |title=Motorland Aragon replaces Hungary on MotoGP calendar |publisher=MotoGp.com |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011 [[Dorna Sports]] signed a contract with the circuit to make it a permanent entry on the main calendar until at least 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2011/motorland+until+2016+in+motogp|title=Dorna and MotorLand Aragón agree extension until 2016|accessdate=16 April 2011|publisher=motogp.com|date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May 2010, it was announced that the circuit will hold a round of the [[Superbike World Championship]] from 2011, with a three-year deal being agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.crash.net/world+superbikes/news/159881/1/motorland_aragn_to_join_wsbk_calendar_from_2011.html|title=MotorLand Aragón to join WSBK calendar from 2011|work=crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|date=2010-05-19|accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circuit was used as part of [[2012 Vuelta a España, Stage 1 to Stage 11|stage seven]] of the [[2012 Vuelta a España]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavuelta.com/12/es/recorrido/index.html?e=7|title=Huesca – Alcañiz.

The '''Estádio da Luz''' ({{IPA-pt|(ɨ)ˈʃtaðju ðɐ ˈluʃ}}), officially named '''Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica''', is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] located in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. It is used mostly for [[association football]] matches, hosting the home games of Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica]]. It is owned by the club's [[Sociedade Anónima Desportiva|SAD]].

Opened on 25 October 2003 with an exhibition match between Benfica and Uruguayan club [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]], it replaced the [[Estádio da Luz (1954)|original Estádio da Luz]], which had 120,000 seats. The seating capacity was decreased to 65,647&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/europe/countries/portugal.shtml|title=Stadiums in Portugal|website=World Stadiums|access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldstadiumdatabase.com/estadio-da-luz-stadium-lisbon-in-portugal.htm|title=Estadio da Luz|website=World Stadium Database|access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently set at 64,642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi/emitentes/docs/fsd150611.pdf#81|title=fsd150611.pdf|date=14 April 2016|website=CMVM|publisher=S.L. Benfica|pages=81–82|language=Portuguese|format=PDF|access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was designed by [[HOK Sport Venue Event]] and had a construction cost of €162&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="cost"&gt;{{cite news|date=29 April 2015|title=Vender jogadores para gerar receitas|trans-title=Selling players to generate revenue|url=https://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/benfica/detalhe/vender-jogadores-para-gerar-receitas|language=pt|work=Record|access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[UEFA stadium categories|UEFA category four stadium]] and one of the [[List of European stadiums by capacity|biggest stadiums by capacity in Europe]] (the biggest of Portugal), the Estádio da Luz hosted several matches of the [[UEFA Euro 2004]], including its [[UEFA Euro 2004 Final|final]], and the [[2014 UEFA Champions League Final]]. Moreover, it was the venue for the [[New7Wonders of the World]] announcement ceremony in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://viajando.expedia.com.br/das-sete-novas-maravilhas-do-mundo-o-cristo-redentor-924/|title=Das Sete Novas Maravilhas do Mundo, o Cristo Redentor|date=19 November 2015|website=Expedia.com.br|language=pt|trans-title=From the New Seven Wonders of the World, Christ the Redeemer|access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was elected as the most beautiful stadium of Europe in an online poll by ''[[L'Équipe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=22 October 2014|title=Estádio da Luz é o mais bonito da Europa|trans-title=Estádio da Luz is the most beautiful of Europe|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/Benfica/interior.aspx?content_id=910997|dead-url=yes|language=Portuguese|newspaper=Record|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024135156/http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/Benfica/interior.aspx?content_id=910997|archive-date=24 October 2014|access-date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=22 October 2014|title=Luz considerado o estádio mais bonito|trans-title=Luz considered the most beautiful stadium|url=https://desporto.sapo.pt/futebol/primeira_liga/artigo/2014/10/22/luz-considerado-o-est-dio-mais-bonito|language=Portuguese|website=SAPO Desporto|access-date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tavares da Silva|first=Hugo|date=22 October 2014|title=Estádio da Luz é o mais bonito da Europa|trans-title=Estádio da Luz is the most beautiful of Europe|url=https://observador.pt/2014/10/22/estadio-da-luz-e-o-mais-bonito-da-europa/|language=Portuguese|website=Observador|access-date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
The [[Estádio da Luz (1954)|previous stadium]], which was also officially named "Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica", was named in honour of [[Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Luz (Carnide)|Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Luz]] (Church of Our Lady of the Light), and the people of Lisbon used to call it ''a Luz'' ("the Light"). Therefore, the stadium's common name became "Estádio da Luz", which is usually anglicised to "Stadium of Light".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lutz|first=Tom|date=20 March 2012|title=Benfica's Stadium of Light to host 2014 Champions League final|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/20/champions-league-final-venue-2014|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translation, however, is inaccurate because ''Luz'' refers not to "light" but to the original address of the stadium: ''Estrada da Luz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slbenfica.pt/pt-pt/estadio/estadiosanteriores/estadiodoslb.aspx|title=Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica (Luz)|website=Sport Lisboa e Benfica - Site Oficial|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, like its predecessor, the current stadium is also referred to as {{lang|pt|a Catedral}} (the Cathedral) or as {{lang|pt|o Inferno da Luz}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/multimedia/videos/interior/benfica-junta-a-festa-de-carnaval-ao-inferno-da-luz-9115289.html|title=Benfica junta a festa de Carnaval ao inferno da Luz|trans-title=Benfica join Carnival celebrations to the ''inferno da Luz''|date=13 February 2018|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Architect Damon Lavelle, from HOK Sport Venue Event (now [[Populous (company)|Populous]]), designed the stadium to focus on light and transparency. Its [[polycarbonate]] roof allows the sunlight to penetrate the stadium in order to illuminate it. The roof, which is supported by [[Tie (engineering)#Rafter tie and Tie-beams|tie-beams]] of four steel arches, seems to float on the underlying tribunes. The arches are 43 metres high and help define the look of the stadium, after having been shaped to be similar to the wavy profile of its three tiers.

In the first quarter-final ever between [[England national football team|England]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], the English side opened the scoring after only two minutes through [[Michael Owen]]. Portugal's constant attacking pressure from then on resulted in [[Hélder Postiga]]'s 83rd-minute equaliser. A controversial incident came in the dying minutes when Michael Owen hit the Portuguese crossbar, resulting in a [[Sol Campbell]] header, which appeared to have given England the lead again, but the header was ruled out for what referee [[Urs Meier]] deemed a foul on the Portuguese goalkeeper [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]]. The sides exchanged goals in extra-time, sending the match to penalty kicks, which Portugal eventually won 6–5. Ricardo saved the penalty from [[Darius Vassell]] and then scored the winning goal.

[[Image:Bmx santa monica beach.jpg|thumb|[[Flatland]] [[BMX]] rider, 'scuffing' the back wheel while performing a "lard yard", at Santa Monica beach]]
'''Flatland''' is a [[freestyle BMX]] riding style performed on smooth flat surfaces that do not include any ramps, jumps, or grindrails. It is sometimes described as a form of [[artistic cycling]] with a blend of [[breakdancing]]. 

Flatland occupies a position somewhat removed from the rest of freestyle BMX. They are often very dedicated, and will spend several hours a day perfecting their techniques.
Flatland also differs from the others in that the terrain used is nothing but a smooth, flat surface. Tricks are performed by spinning and balancing on the bike in a variety of unexpected positions. Riders almost always use either knurled/grip taped aluminum or plastic pegs to stand on to manipulate the bike into even more imaginative positions.

Flatland bikes typically have a shorter wheelbase than other freestyle bikes. This shorter wheelbase requires less effort to make the bike spin or to position the bike on one wheel. One of the primary reasons flatlanders often ride only flatland is the decreased stability of using their shorter bikes on ramps, dirt and street.
A variety of options is commonly found on flatland bikes. The most unifying feature of flatland bikes is the use of four pegs, one on the end of each wheel axle. Flatlanders will choose to run a front brake (or a dual front brake; one front brake with two brake levers using one brake cable), front and rear brakes, or no brakes at all, depending on stylistic preference.

==Flatland bikes==
Although the flatland bicycle is similar to most other BMX bicycles, flatland is often performed with specially designed frames with geometry (head tube angle, top tube length, etc.) suited to the needs of flatlanders. Front and rear bolt-on pegs, a hollow compression bolt on the forks for the front brake cable, and a rear brake cable [[detangler]] or ''Gyro'' to allow the bars to rotate endlessly without tangling the brake cables. Also invented specifically for flatland riding is the [[cogset|rear hub]] mechanism known as a [[freecoaster]], which allows the rear wheel to roll backwards without engaging the hub and making the [[crankset|cranks]] rotate backwards as they would on a normal freewheel or cassette style hub. Other technical bicycle setup specifics can include zero offset forks, narrow handlebars, very high pressure tires (100psi and higher), and a very small front sprocket (18-28 teeth).

==Style==
In competition, talent and skill are judged by the ability to maintain coordination, and [[equilibrioception|balance]] while performing a variety of difficult and elegant moves. There are usually several categories for judging purposes which can include: 
*number of touches: the number of times a trick is not completed and/or the number of touches of the foot to the ground
*number of tricks completed in the allotted time
*difficulty of the tricks, which can be very subjective, as flatland techniques have in many ways become as refined as those in [[figure skating]] or [[breakdancing]]
*originality of the tricks performed, which again can be somewhat subjective
*style and flow, or how smoothly and/or stylishly moves are performed during the contest run 
* Showmanship; the ability to present your routine to the crowd. Hugo Gonzales and Dave Vanderspek, while not the top pros were known for their elaborate showmanship and antics.

Flatland is an involving, time-consuming discipline in which the rider learns different balance/counterbalance points and [[center of gravity|center-of-gravity]] in [[kinesiology|motion]] techniques through repetition and trial-and-error. Some tricks can be learned in hours, while others may take years to master.

Various riders emphasize different aspects of the discipline: the [[artistic]] nature of flatland and the originality of tricks, the number and difficulty of tricks, or the simple enjoyment of the activity. Only contest riders need to be concerned with the competitive side of the discipline, as there are many riders who prefer doing shows, taking parts in [[video]]s, or simply riding with their friends and enjoying themselves.

Riders usually pedal a few times for speed, and then perform various stunts often involving difficult and/or awkward stances on pegs, mounted to the axles of their front or back wheels. Pegs are aluminum or plastic tubes, which are bolted onto both sides of the front and back axles. When flatland riding first began, most riders would do one trick and then return to the pedals. However, by combining different body and bicycle positions into "combos" and "linking" them together, riders began to do several tricks in a row without stopping between each move. Flatland riding is now usually a combination of many different kinds of moves, often linked together non-stop as the rider goes through as many as 10-12 consecutive moves, and position/direction changes, before returning to the pedals.

==History==
Flatland originated from three pioneers; [[R. L. Osborn]], [[Bob Haro]], and [[Bob Morales]]. R. L. Osborn was a fan favorite in the mid 80s, being the highest paid BMX flatland professional ever after signing a contract with General Bicycles for around US$100,000. Bob Haro went on to become founder of Haro Bicycles. Bob Morales was the founder of the once elite [[American Freestyle Association]]. The AFA was the dominating league for both professional and amateur flatland and quarter pipe events. While there were several amateur AFA events the Masters series contest, held throughout the US was the biggest pro/am flatland/quarter pipe event of the time.
 
Flatland's roots can be dated back to the 1950s. Flatland has gone through many stylistic changes since its beginnings in the late 1970s. Riders once wore full protective gear and full face helmets, starred in feature-length films such as [[Rad (film)]], and performed in large-scale events such as NBA halftimes. Following the decline in popularity and subsequent recession in most action sports at the end of the 80s, flatland went "[[subculture|underground]]". It resurfaced in the late 90s with the return of media attention in the form of events such as the [[X Games]]. Flatland was dropped from the X Games and other large-scale events in the early 2000s, forcing the sport/artform to become more independently run and owned. Most flatland companies and events now exist outside of other BMX circles, although there is still, somewhat limited, coverage in mainstream BMX magazines and videos. &lt;br /&gt;
With the removal of flatland from events such as the XGames, many independent event organizers have stepped up and taken flatland to the masses through creative, independently organized events such as the Red Bull Circle Balance, Circle Cow, and BMX Masters events in Europe, the Elevation Flatland series and Voodoo Jams in the US, and smaller "jams" such as the Athens Jam and Hollywood Jams which take place in the US.  These independent events and jams are what has helped keep flatland "alive" and thriving over the years.

==Flatland tricks==
Flatland tricks are given names, usually by the first person to invent it. For example, the first flatland "bunnyhop tailwhip" was first landed in a Burger King parking lot by Bill Nitschke, and there named a "whopper". Terry Adams invented a trick following [[Hurricane Katrina]] (since Terry lives in Louisiana), and named his new trick "The Katrina".

The name may be modified (referencing whether it is rolled, scuffed, g-turned, stationary, etc.) or included in a list of other tricks, with "links" such as "bar-flip into" or "jump to", to indicate a combination, often shortened to "combo."

These names generally apply to popular positions, or combinations of tricks:

== Tricks and Spins ==
{{cleanup-list|date=September 2012}}
*Endo: The original flatland trick. Done by either sharply applying the front brakes at low speed or running the front wheel into a curb causing the rear wheel to lift off of the ground above the front. An Alternate way to do this is by jamming either of your feet into the fork. Also used to gain momentum to lead into other tricks like the Decade or the Backside walkaround.  
*Miami Hopper: The rider stands on the pedals and grasps the seat tip in right hand, and the front brake lever in left hand. The rider quickly applies the front brake and simultaneously rotates the handlebars 90 degrees counterclockwise towards the seat and pulls up sharply on the seat. This will cause the rear of the bike to rise up and seemingly flip over the front. If landed correctly, the front wheel will lay parallel to the ground and the right handlebar grip will be balancing on the ground leaving the rider perched above the rear wheel. From this position, the rider can make various poses, kick the bike out to the side and lay it down, or lean back sharply and reverse the trick and ride away. *note* the hands and handlebar directions would be reversed if the bike was set up with the front brake lever on the right hand side. (Uncommon set up) 
*Cherry Picker: The rider places a foot on the rear tire behind the bottom bracket and swings their other leg over the head tube and rests the other foot on the seat tube. Then either using the handlebars for stability or clamping the legs tightly, the rider bounces up and down causing the entire bike to hop on the rear wheel.
*Boomerang: The rider applies the front brakes and jumps from either the pedals or rear dropouts while tucking the legs into the chest and spins around with the handlebars 360 degrees. *note* Can be done without brakes, also known as a Rolling Boomerang. A variant of the Rolling Boomerang exists known as the Stick Man, with the rider leaving the legs straight out and to the side while locking the handlebars level with the hips.  
*Fork Glide: The rider stands on the front peg and spins 180 degrees. From here the rider can use their foot on the tire to move along. This trick is commonly used as a starting point to other tricks.
*Steamroller: Forward Fork Glide on the front wheel holding the seat, usually rode into with a Half Lash.
* Footjam Tailwhip: The rider uses the front brake to swing the frame 360 degrees around while keeping one foot on the front tire. 
*Fire Hydrant: :The rider performs a basic Fork Glide and then swings the frame back round towards them.
*G-Turn: Whipping the frame into a spinning Endo with feet on the pedals.
*Decade: Lifting the front wheel up and jumping over the head tube and landing with the left foot on the top tube to ride out.
*Rolaid: Rolling Decade. Brakeless. The Decade and Rolaid can be done in multiples.
*Backside Walkaround: The rider lifts the front wheel up while standing on the rear axle pegs. Using the outside leg, the rider brings that leg in a crossing pattern in between the bike and riders' body. The rider then swings the leg around and over the head tube and places that foot on the seat tube. In a very precarious position, the rider then brings around the other leg from behind and over the head tube ending on the other side of the bike in an almost backwards position. *note* Can be done one-handed, with only the right hand on the grip and the other hand thrown out similar to a bull rider. 
*Whiplash: Rolling Tailwhip. Can be done without brakes. Can be done in multiples.
*Cliffhanger: A rolling Endo with either foot on the front pegs and the torso behind the seat for a balance point.
*Hang Five: Placing one foot on one of the front pegs and pulling the frame up until seat meets contact and a balance point is established; a rolling Endo. The foot not on the peg is used as a counterbalance.
*Hang Ten: Similar to the Hang Five, but with both feet on the front pegs.
*Hang Nothing: Similar to the Hang Five, but without either foot on the peg. Both feet are used as a counterbalance.
*Elbow Glide: Placing one foot on one of the front pegs with one side of the body and the opposite elbow tucked with the seat to control the balance point.
*Hitchhiker: Tilting the bike completely forward on the front wheel while rolling, standing both feet on the front pegs; holding the bike in front of you, by the underside of the backwheel or holding an axle peg.
*Backpacker: Related to the Hitchhiker, but with the body positioned forward with the bike behind the body.
*Cow maneuver or Smith Decade: Placing the frame up and tucking a rotation on the pegs backwards into the pedals first performed by Gerry Smith; this trick has many variants and can be performed without brakes (Chase Gouin).  
*Surfer: Placing one foot on the seat and the other foot on the handlebars' crossbar while rolling; popular in some videos and commercials.
*Scurfer: Same as the Surfer, but with only one foot on the handlebars' crossbar.
*Death Truck: Rolling a back Peg Wheelie and pulling the body over the handlebars; one of the most feared tricks in flatland not because of its difficulty, but because of the potential tangled bail.
*Bar Ride: Standing up while both feet are on the grips of the bars or the crossbar and using only the torso and hands for a balance point while rolling.
*Backwards Rubber Ride: Similar to a bar ride in execution, but with the rider standing on the handlebars facing the rear of the bike and rolling backwards. 
*Bar Hop: While standing up on the pedals, the rider jumps up and over the handlebar crossbar while tucking their knees into the chest. Upon landing your buttocks on the crossbar, one can scuff the front wheel and continue to roll or climb back over the handlebars.
*Backyard: A scuffing trick performed by a foot push and control on the tires, while facing away from the frame on the back pegs.
*Gerator (also "lardyard"): Similar to the backyard, but holding on to one handlegrip while scuffing and more off the side and back while scuffing in a circle.
*Megaspin: Spinning on the back tire in a circular motion.
*Front Yard: Front yards are one of the basis tricks for front wheel scuffing.  They are pretty easy to learn, and then you can take them one handed and no-handed. Rolling very slowly, step over the bars with scuffing foot and rest it on the front tire.  Your other leg/foot on the pedal.  When ready, apply the brakes and put your foot firmly on the front tire getting ready to scuff.  Move your other foot off the pedal and onto the front corresponding peg.  The braking and moving your other foot need to happen at the same time while you push a little bit forward on the bars to get the backend to come a little off the ground.  Now start you scuffing pattern giving the tire a little kick forward, then hitting the brake and repeating, trying to keep your arms firm and hold the position locked out. When satisfied, give the tire a kick but and let the backend fall to the ground, step back to the pedal and pick your other leg back over the bars.  Congrats!
*Pogos: Stand on the back pegs and do and endo, then pick up the front wheel and hop.
*Lawn Mower/Can-Can Lawn Mower: Do an Endo, as the back wheel hit the ground, turn the handlebars towards you and kick the seat down with the right foot.  The Can-Can Lawn Mower is when you kick the leg out to the side instead of putting it on the seat.
*Flail: Do a Rolling Boomerang, halfway through, put the right foot on the front peg and the left foot on the back peg, then flip the bar and pivot your body around.
*Squeaker: Put the left foot on the front peg and the other foot on the pedal, grab the front brake, and put the foot on the tire. When your foot comes off the tire, grab the front brake.
*Pinky Squeak: A Tailwhip with a kick, can be done in multiples.
*Tomahawk/Framestand Tomahawk: Lift the leg over the bar, grab the brake, spin around, then grab the seat and start squeaking back. Do a Tomahawk, grab the brake and put the foot on the frame.
*Stick B (also "Dump Truck"): Do an endo, turn the handlebar put the left hand on the peg, take the other hand off the grip and put it on the peg and start scuffing. Good Job!
*Steamboat: Steamroller with the leg over the bar, can be linked with Steamroller

: *NOTE: These tricks mentioned are a few within the art/sport of flatland. These tricks and others have variants and depend upon the style of the rider performing them. Also, these tricks can be linked or combined into sequences or routines that could not otherwise be titled as a single trick.

The '''Harris Cup''' is an [[ice hockey]] championship [[trophy]], awarded annually to the [[NCAA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] [[Northern Collegiate Hockey Association]] (NCHA) league playoff champion.

The trophy originated with the [[Midwest Collegiate Hockey Association]].  The MCHA first awarded a championship trophy in 1998.  The trophy was renamed the Harris Cup in 2002 and first awarded under that name in 2003.  All previous winners of the MCHA trophy are inscribed on the trophy and recognized as Harris Cup awardees.  The trophy is named after Dan Harris, who served as MCHA league president through 2002 and is the long-serving athletics director for [[Milwaukee School of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mchahockey.com/New_Season/News_Notes/2002-2003.htm#1|title=MCHA Names Championship Trophy After Departing President|publisher=Midwest Collegiate Hockey Association|date=May 1, 2002|accessdate=March 26, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511210530/http://www.mchahockey.com/New_Season/News_Notes/2002-2003.htm#1|archivedate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the MCHA and NCHA's merger in 2013, the trophy will be awarded to the NCHA's playoff champion beginning in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carito|first=Katie|title=NCHA is reborn|url=http://www.uscho.com/2013/04/24/ncha-is-reborn/|work=USCHO.com|accessdate=June 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HEfZmL3X|archivedate=June 8, 2013|deadurl=no|date=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homer Stryker Field''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]]. The baseball field is located in Kalamazoo's Mayors Riverfront Park.  It is primarily used for [[baseball]], and is the home field for the [[Kalamazoo Growlers]] of the [[List of collegiate summer baseball leagues|collegiate summer baseball]] [[Northwoods League]].  It used to be the home field of the [[Kalamazoo Kings]] [[minor league]] baseball team in the [[Frontier League]].  It opened in 1963, and holds 4,000 people.

Homer Stryker Field became the home of the Kalamazoo Kings in 2001. It had hosted the Kodiaks, another [[Frontier League]] team; each team has made some renovations to a facility that has been in use in some form since 1925, although the oldest part of the current structure, a concrete grandstand now with aluminum benches, appears to date to 1963.

The 1995 renovation added new aluminum seating and a press box above the old grandstand, along with some additional bleacher sections flanking the central stand. Some new outbuildings have been constructed in the last few years.
The field is somewhat unorthodox in that home plate is at the northeast corner of the grounds;&lt;ref&gt;https://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1C1GGGE_enUS390US390&amp;q=homer+stryker+field&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wl. accessed 10/5/10&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally and commonly, baseball fields have home plate at the westernmost end of the grounds so batters do not have to face the sun while hitting.

[[Homer Stryker]] was the patriarch of the [[Stryker Corp.|Stryker Corporation]]. The Stryker family bought the naming rights in 2002 and placed Homer’s name on the field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11496">'''Inner tube water polo''' (ITWP) is a variation of the sport [[water polo]] with the important difference that players, excluding the [[goalkeeper]], are required to float in inflatable [[inner tube]]s.  By floating in an inner tube, players experience less contact and expend less energy than traditional water polo players, not having to [[tread water]].  This allows casual players to enjoy water polo without undertaking the intense conditioning required for conventional water polo.

This sport is predominantly played at universities by [[intramural]] [[coed]] teams,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imprintmagazine.org/life_and_style/not_your_ordinary_intramurals Cassavaugh, Dan. Not Your Ordinary Intramurals. Imprint Magazine.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123105748/http://imprintmagazine.org/life_and_style/not_your_ordinary_intramurals |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but can also be found in recreational adult leagues. The sport's rules resemble those of [[water polo]], however, with no governing body the rules vary across different leagues. For example, while the winner is determined by the team which scores the most goals, some leagues award one point for a male goal, and two points for a female goal, while others award one for either.

== History ==
The game was invented in 1969 by now retired [[UC Davis]] associate athletic director of intramural sports and sport clubs, Gary Colberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2006/05/31/Sports/After.40.Years.Im.Sports.Director.Retires-2014963.shtml?norewrite200606091046&amp;sourcedomain=www.californiaaggie.com Gary Colberg: Inner tube water polo]{{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noticing how much fun the water polo team was having, Mr. Colberg thought up the idea of using tubes so that people with no experience in water polo could still enjoy the game.

== Rules ==
There is no governing body or official rules, but the following details have been derived from a combination of innertubewaterpolo.com and the [[NYC Social Sports Club]]’s rules and instructions.

===Team Requirements===

* A team consists of 6 players (5 + a goalie, or 6 attackers if goalie is ‘pulled’), but may play with a minimum of 4 players. 
* Each team must have a minimum of two men and two women playing at all times. 
===Equipment===

* Inner tubes – these may be true inner tubes from tires or more pedestrian ones found at any store that sells pool and aquatic toys.
* Nets – These should be the same as water polo nets.
* Ball – These should be the same as water polo balls.

===Game Length===

* There are two halves, 20 minutes each.
* The clock runs continuously. 
* Teams will change sides at half-time.
* All ties at the end of playing time will be broken by a shootout.

===Play Area - Side lines===

* The court is the rectangle formed by the pool walls and (if smaller than full pool) lane lines. 
* A ball is considered in-bounds until it makes contact with the pool deck or pool surface outside the boundary area. 
* The ball changes possession when it goes out-of-bounds.
* A player may make a play on a ball outside the play court as long as
** The ball is in the air,
** The player's tube is in-bounds, and
** The player remains in their tube. 
* Any shot or pass that ricochets off a diving board, backstroke flags or other pool equipment within the court boundary and lands in-bounds is a live ball.

===Start of Play===

* To start each half, and after each goal, both teams line up at opposite ends of the pool. 
* All players must be in contact with the wall before play begins.
* The referee throws the ball into the center of the pool while simultaneously blowing the whistle to begin play. 
* On the official's whistle both teams may paddle their tubes toward the ball.
** Pushing off the wall is legal at start.

===Stoppage of Play===

* The referee blowing his/her whistle always signals an immediate stoppage of play and a dead ball.  This can be for free throws, fouls, injuries, time-outs, penalties, or any other reason the referee deems necessary.
* The play stops if the ball travels out-of-bounds for any reason.

===Substitutions===

*teams may substitute when:
** A goal is scored,
** The play ends because the ball went out-of-bounds, or
** A time-out is called.
* A goalie can only be substituted for by someone on the sidelines if the ball is live or by anyone if the ball is dead.

===Possession===

* All players, except the goalie, must sit in a horizontal position, facing up inside the inner tube.  A goalie must have at least one body part through the hole in the inner tube at all times.  They may also sit in the tube.
* If a player falls out of their tube, the player may not participate in the game in any way.
* Players move with the ball by: 
** Pushing it in the water, 
** Holding it between their knees, 
** Gripping it with 2 hands, 
** Gripping it with 1 hand, 
** Pressing it against their body,
** Or holding it in their lap. 
* A player may not hold the ball completely under the water.
* Players may not deliberately hold the ball to delay the game.
* Referees are often charged with determining who receives the ball as a result of a tied-up ball or other infraction.

===Contact Between Players===

* Inner tube to inner tube contact is legal.
* Incidental inner tube to body contact is legal.
* A defending player may touch the ball when it is in possession of an opposing player.  This includes swatting the ball out of player’s hand.
* It is legal for a defensive player to try to push the player with the ball out of his tube, thus forcing a turnover. 
* Any illegal contact between players will result in a free throw.

===Free Throws===

* Free throws are awarded for violations at the point nearest the spot of the infraction.
* During a free throw, the person who starts the ball into play has 3 seconds to pass the ball to a teammate.
* A goal may not be scored until a second offensive player touches the ball after the free throw.
* The defense must provide 2 feet of space from the point of the free throw.
* Free throws are awarded in the following scenarios:
** Any offensive player enters the goalie box.
** The ball goes out-of-bounds.
* Players may not interfere with another player, with or without the ball, in the following manners:
** Holding,
** Pushing,
** Hitting, 
** Splashing,
** Dunking, or,
** Tackling. 
* A ball that goes out in the goal box is given to the goalie for a free throw.

===Penalty Shots===

* Penalty shots shall be taken by the offended player at the backstroke flags (if no flags exist, it should be 5 meters or 15 feet from goal). 
* No defensive player may be within 2 feet of the shooter.
* If the result of the penalty shot is not a goal, the ball remains in play. 
** Exception: The ball is dead in a shoot-out if the ball does not go in the net.
* A penalty shot will be awarded in the following scenarios:
** A defensive player enters the goal box to make a play.
** A goalie abandons his/her tube to block a shot.

===Goalie===

* The goalie may not abandon his/her tube in an attempt to block a shot from entering the goal. Remember, they do not have to sit in the tube but rather just have a part of their body in/through it at all times.
** If the goalie leaves his/her tube while blocking a shot on goal, this will result in a penalty shot for the offensive team.
* The goalie may never pass the ball beyond the mid-pool line.
* The goalie may not leave the goal box area during play.
* Once the goalie gains possession of the ball, he/she will have 3 seconds to release the ball.
* A ball in play may be passed back to the goalie. The goalie will have 3 seconds to release the ball.
* A goalie can be pulled for another attacking player during normal substitution times (see Substitutions).

===Goals===

* A goal is scored when a legal shot (taken outside the goal box) completely crosses the goal line.
* A player scoring a goal must remain in his/her tube after the goal is scored or the score will be disallowed.
* A shot taken from inside the goal box will be disallowed and the ball will be given to the goalie for a free throw.
* After a goal is scored, the referee will start play in the center of the pool again (see Start of Play).

===Shootouts===

* Five players from each team will be selected by the team to shoot (goalkeepers may be one of the shooters).
* At least 2 men and 2 women must shoot.  They should alternate.
* Shooters do not have to have been in the pool at the end of play. 
* Goalies will be the same as the goalies from the end of play.
* A coin flip or another creative method of determining order will decide which team shoots first.
* Each team has a total of 5 penalty shots and will alternate each shot. No rebounds.
* The referee signals the start of each penalty shot with a whistle blow.
* If the score is tied at the end of the first shootout, a ‘sudden-death’ shootout will ensue.
** Once one team leads after an equal number of shots have taken, the game is over. 
* Only players who shot in the first round are eligible to shoot in the second round. 
* The gender order established in the first round will be maintained in the second round.
* Teams must have an equal ratio of male to females during penalty shots (i.e., both teams must have either 3 women and 2 men or 3 men and 2 women shooting).

===Misconduct===

Most leagues have their own rules governing misconduct, flagrant fouls, and other more egregious penalties.

[[File:Jet lev jet pack.jpg|thumb|A JetLev jetpack in use]]
The '''JetLev Flyer''' is a water-propelled [[jet pack]] powered through a floater derived from [[jetski]] technology attached through an umbilical to the backpack which contains two nozzles and two control arms, in a configuration like traditional rocket belts and gas turbine jet belts. The JetLev also functions underwater, allowing users to dive into the water and jet back out. The jetpack can allow users to fly up to {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the water. It was created by Canadian engineer Raymond Li. JetLev became the first practical amateur-usable jet pack, and first with practical usable duration. The JetLev technology jetpack became the first commercially released jetpack in 2009. It was initially offered for sale for $100,000 USD, however with much cheaper competitors coming on the market afterwards, inspired by the original JetLev, such as the [[Flyboard]], prices rapidly dropped, with cheaper models.&lt;ref name=AirSpaceMag-2009-09-28&gt; {{cite magazine |url= https://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/wasser-von-braun-117142258/ |title= Wasser von Braun |author= Mike Klesius |date= 28 September 2009 |magazine= Air &amp; Space Magazine |publisher= Smithsonian }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyPlanet-2009-04-19&gt; {{cite episode |airdate= 19 April 2009 |title= JetLev |series= Daily Planet |network= Discovery Channel Canada }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PopSci-2009-07-30&gt; {{cite magazine |url= http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2009-07/water-powered-jetpack |title= A Water-Powered Jetpack |author= Rena Marie Pacella |date= 30 July 2009 |magazine= Popular Science }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WorldsStrangest-Vehicles-20130411&gt; {{cite episode |series= World's Strangest |title= Vehicles |date= 11 April 2013 |network= Discovery Science }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ISBN-9781613744338-166-168&gt; {{cite book |title= The Great American Jet Pack: The Quest for the Ultimate Individual Lift Device |year= 2013 |publisher= Chicago Review Press |author= Steve Lehto |isbn= 9781613744338 |pages= 166-168 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYPost-2013-08-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=BaltimoreSun-2014-07-15/&gt;&lt;ref name=H2RO-2016-09-14/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYPost-2013-08-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=BaltimoreSun-2014-07-15/&gt;

==History==
Raymond Li started working on the concept in 2000. By 2003, he was seeking funding to keep developing the concept. He received a grant from the National Research Council of Canada. The prototype jetpack attached to a jetski, first flew manned in 2004. In 2005, Li moved part-time to Fort Lauderdale on a temporary work visa to continue development with assistance from jetski experts. [[Hydroflight]] patents were issued to Raymond Li in 2008, and passed to the holding company JetLev Intellectual Property. Investors started calling Li in 2008. JetLev the sued the makers of Flyboard, [[Jetovator]], and manufacturers of other hydrojetpacks for patent infringement, starting in 2012. The intellectual property was bought by [[Zapata Industries]], the maker of Flyboard, in 2016, consolidating the leading market hydroflight jetpacks in one company.&lt;ref name=Amex-2013-05-23&gt; {{cite web |url= https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/raymond-li-of-jetlev-how-james-bond-inspired-him-to-invent-a-jet-pack/ |title= Raymond Li of Jetlev: How James Bond Inspired Him to Invent a Jet Pack |author= Katie Morell |date= 23 May 2013 |publisher= American Express }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marketwired-2016-08-17&gt; {{cite news |url= http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/zapata-industries-announces-acquisition-consolidation-hydro-flight-intellectual-property-otcqb-imsc-2151509.htm |title= Zapata Industries Announces the Acquisition and Consolidation of Hydro-Flight Intellectual Property Rights in the US and Abroad |publisher= Marketwired |date= 17 August 2016 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H2RO-2016-09-14&gt; {{cite magazine |url= http://www.h2romagazine.com/h2ro-news/hydrofight |title= Hydrofight Sports – No this is not a typo |author= Blaine Jeffery |date= 14 September 2016 |publisher= H2RO Magazine }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''KF Besa Pejë''' (Klubi Futbollistik Besa Pejë) commonly known as Besa is a [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Peć]], [[Kosovo]].{{ref label|status|a|}} Their home ground is [[Shahin Haxhiislami (stadium)|Shahin Haxhiislami]] and they compete in the [[Football Superleague of Kosovo]].

==History==

===Early history (1923–1945)===
The current club is considered to be the successor of a number of different football and sports clubs that had been active in the city of [[Peć]] since 1923, with the first being Behari i Ri who were the original club that today's KF Besa Pejë is based on. In 1924 another club named Gajret Pejë was formed, but ended disbanded soon after. Other clubs that were also formed in Peć at the time were Zeleni Venac in 1925, Tarabosh in 1927, Dukagjini Pejë in 1928, Radnički Peć in 1930, Budućnost Peć in 1935 and Ardhmëria Pejë who were active between 1941 and 1945. Between 1923 and [[World War II]], the different clubs representing the city of Peć competed only in friendly tournaments as none of the clubs were members of the [[Belgrade Football Subassociation]]. A club representing the city competed in the [[1942 Albanian Superliga]], but the war period championships that were held in Albania are not recognised by the [[Albanian Football Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sktirana.com/public/kuvend/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=466 Copy of Besnik Dizdari Historia e Kampionatëve të Shqipërise. Vol. III: Vitet 1939–’42 Ombra GVG, Tiranë, 2004, p. 150] at sktirana.com {{sq icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of football (1945–1991)===
Following the end of World War II, football in Peć and the rest of the Kosovo region became more prominent and this was in no part due to the rise in tournaments and championships that were held regularly. The most dominant club of the post war era was Yugoslav backed FK Budućnost Peć, but other clubs were also active including Përparimi Pejë, who only functioned between 1949 and 1951. Other clubs active after World War II included Kombinati i Drurit, Klubi Kristal, who were active between 1973 and 1990. Another club that was formed in the 1970s was Klubi Kombinatit Bujqësor Industrial, a club heavily involved in the agricultural business at the time. In 1974 the first club to be called Besa was formed, which is where the current name of the club comes from, which is an Albanian cultural precept meaning "faith" and "to keep a promise". Other clubs were formed to represent the different professions in the city at the time, including Klubi Fabrikës së Autopjesëve of the automobile parts factory, Klubi Kombinatit të Lëkur-Këpucëve of the leather and footwear factory and Kosovatransi Klubi Ndërrmarjes Transportuese Të Udhëtarëve of the shipyard passenger transport profession.

===End of Yugoslavia (1991–1998)===
There was widespread ethnic tension in [[Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s.  The three main clubs that were left in Peć at the time, Besa, Budućnost and Kristal, held a joint assembly early in 1991 and decided to merge the clubs in order to create what is now known as KF Besa Pejë that was to compete in the independent League of Kosovo that was organised by the [[Football Federation of Kosovo]], which was out of the [[Yugoslav football league system]]. This parallel competitions were of poor standard and were limited to matches played in remote villages on fields rather since the stadiums were still property of the clubs which were competing in the Yugoslav leagues. Until 1996 the [[Football Superleague of Kosovo|Kosovo Superleague]] was held in four different groups, who's winners would then face each other in a playoff to determine the champions, but in 1996 the original league format was restored. The 1997–98 Kosovo Superleague was interrupted due to the start of the [[Kosovo War]] while KF Besa was top of the league.

===Post war rebuilding (1999–2003)===
The Kosovo War devastated the country, including Peć, and sports activities were put on hold in 1999. Football, much like most things in Kosovo, had to restart once again and the development of KF Besa Pejë was slow as the club began to rebuild from 1999. The club relied on donors from the city, and the main donor of the post war period was Birra Peja and the brewery, who became the club's main financier in July 2003.

The '''Old Stagers''' ('''OS''') is an amateur [[theatre]] group, founded in 1842 by Hon. [[Frederick Ponsonby, 6th Earl of Bessborough|Frederick Ponsonby]] (later [[Earl of Bessborough]]) to perform during Kent's annual [[Canterbury Cricket Week]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H.S. Altham]], ''A History of Cricket: Volume 1'', 1962 edition, George Allen and Unwin Ltd, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the '''Canterbury Old Stagers''', it took its current name in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CGQI-HeJV5IC&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Shakespeare and Amateur Performance: A Cultural History - Michael Dobson - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It claims to be the oldest surviving [[amateur dramatics|amateur dramatic]] company in the world, having staged its first shows in [[Canterbury]] in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6m9aaDzyQpQC&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Among the Fans: From Ashes to the Arrows, a Year of Watching the Watchers - Patrick Collins - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tel"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1453868/Sue-Tilling.html ''Daily Telegraph'' obituary of Sue Tilling, published 10 February 2004] Retrieved 5 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It has continued to give annual performances since (with intermissions for the two [[World War]]s).&lt;ref name="tel"/&gt; It now stages its plays at the [[Gulbenkian Theatre]] in Canterbury.

The Old Stagers has close links to [[Kent County Cricket Club]] and the [[I Zingari]] nomadic amateur [[cricket]] club. Ponsonby was also a founder of I Zingari, and later became president of [[Surrey County Cricket Club]]. One of the earliest Old Stagers was the Kent and England cricketer [[Alfred Mynn]] who first appeared in 1847 and then regularly until his death in 1861.

Old Stagers Amateur Dramatic Society records, including programmes, newspaper reviews and photographs of productions from 1842-2003, are archived at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] Library as item U449.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/assets/files/docs/pdf/History_and_heritage/archives_newsletters/Newsletter%2030.pdf Canterbury Cathedral Archives &amp; Library News, Newsletter 30, February 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324131717/http://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/assets/files/docs/pdf/History_and_heritage/archives_newsletters/Newsletter%2030.pdf |date=2012-03-24 }} Retrieved 5 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PalaLottomatica''', formerly known as '''Palazzo dello Sport''' or '''PalaEUR''', is a multi-purpose sports and entertainment [[arena]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. It is located in the heart of the well known modern [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] complex. The arena hosted the [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic basketball tournaments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1960/OR1960v1.pdf 1960 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. pp. 68, 70, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium features 8 meetings points, a restaurant for 300 people and a 2,700 square metre (3,229 sq. yard) outdoor terrace. It has a [[seating capacity]] of 11,200 spectators for basketball games.

==History==
Palazzo dello Sport was designed by architect [[Marcello Piacentini]] in 1957 and its reinforced concrete dome was engineered by [[Pier Luigi Nervi]] and it was constructed in two years from 1958–1960 in time for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]. The facility was designed and built along with a smaller facility, the [[Palazzetto dello Sport]], its dome also engineered by Nervi.

Formerly known as PalaSport and informally as PalaEUR, by the name of the neighbourhood that hosts it, the '[[EUR, Rome|EUR]]' precisely, it was renamed "PalaLottomatica" with the name of [[Lottomatica]], the main sponsor that financed the modernization work from 1999 to 2003.

===Modernization===
The stadium has been made more functional, especially in terms of acoustics, to also accommodate important musical events. Other changes were made to the original aesthetics of the stadium, particularly the night lighting of exterior glazing that now occurs at  "tabellone della tombola", with numbers dramatically illuminated behind the glass.

After the remodeling, it is able to accommodate up to 11,200 seated spectators. The structure is versatile and hosts sporting events (including internal competitions of, for example, [[Pallacanestro Virtus Roma]]), concerts, conferences, and theatrical events.

The PalaLottomatica Rome, together with [[Mediolanum Forum]] of Milan, is a member of the [[European Arenas Association]] (EAA).

==Events==
The arena hosted the [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic basketball tournaments]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1960/OR1960v1.pdf 1960 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. pp. 68, 70, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[EuroBasket 1991|1991]] [[EuroBasket|European basketball championships]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurobasket2005.fibaeurope.com/en/cid_sk8JreR-ILQY3WYBLQw7L0.html Basketball in Serbia And Montenegro (SCG)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625034058/http://eurobasket2005.fibaeurope.com/en/cid_sk8JreR-ILQY3WYBLQw7L0.html |date=2009-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Euroleague]] 1997 [[Final Four]].

In 1997, the PalaLottomatica hosted the Euroleague Final Four (at the final Olympiakos defeat Barcelona by 73-58)
and the final stage of the 2005 Men's European Volleyball Championship, oversubscribed in the final between Italy and Russia, Hosting one of its terraces an audience of over 14,000 spectators were disappointed that thanks to a 3–2 comeback victory in Italy, after a thrilling game that lasted over two hours.
The [[WWE]] ran a show on November 7, 2008 at the PalaLottomatica.

The PalaEUR was also a venue of the [[1978 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|1978]] and [[2010 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship]] as well as the [[2014 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship]]. The venue was also named the host of the [[2016–17 CEV Champions League]] Final 4 in volleyball on April 29 and 30, 2017 - which follows prior hosting rights to the 2011 event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Palalottomatica in Rome Will Host the CEV Champions League Final 4 |author= Mitch Bowmile |url= https://volleymob.com/palalottomatica-rome-will-host-cev-champions-league-final-four/  |publisher= VolleyMob |date=2017-01-17|accessdate= 2017-01-19 |language= English }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 a [[Lou Reed]] concert was cancelled because of turmoils between police and groups of people who protested against the high prices of concert tickets; because of those turmoils the Palazzo dello Sport was seriously damaged&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Semidistrutto il Palasport di Roma nella lotta tra teppisti e la polizia|first= Fabrizio|last=Carbone|url= http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,0007/articleid,1105_02_1975_0037_0007_23910679/| newspaper= [[La Stampa]]  |location=Turin|date= 1975-02-17|accessdate=2011-06-05 |language= Italian|trans-title=Half-destroyed the Rome PalaSport After the Riot Involving Police and Hooligans }}&lt;/ref&gt; and foreigner artists refused to perform in Italy for the following 5 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Quando l'Italia non era nei tour |first= Ernesto|last= Assante|url= http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1993/07/11/quando-italia-non-era-nei-tour.html|newspaper=la Repubblica |location=Roma |date=1993-07-11 |accessdate= 2011-06-05|language=Italian |trans-title=When Italy Was Kept Off Of Tours}}&lt;/ref&gt; until [[Bob Marley]] performed in Milan in 1980. The [[Spice Girls]] performed a show in March 1998 during their [[Spiceworld Tour]]. This arena also hosted the concert of [[Avril Lavigne]] with her [[The Black Star Tour]] on September 10, 2011.

The first artist to perform after the modernization and the renaming as PalaLottomatica was [[Carlos Santana]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Santana, sushi e basket: il menù Palalottomatica |first= Francesca|last=Giuliani |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2003/09/19/santana-sushi-basket-il-menu-palalottomatica.html  |newspaper=la Repubblica|location= Rome |date= 2003-09-19|accessdate= 2011-06-05|language=Italian |trans-title=Santana, Sushi and Basketball: This Is the PalaLottomatica Menu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Podmoskovie Stadium''', situated in the suburb of [[Shchelkovo]] some 15&amp;nbsp;km from the centre of [[Moscow]], is one of the oldest stadia in [[Russia]]. The Russian word ''[[Podmoskovye]]'' means "Moscow Region".

Built in 1928, it underwent a major refurbishment in 2003 to modernise its facilities. The ground was expanded to the capacity of 5,000 and features two playing pitches, one natural and one artificial, as well as indoor arenas dedicated to [[futsal]], [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]] and [[Physical fitness|fitness]]. As part of the preparations for the [[2006 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Championship]], the stadium received new seating areas, improved floodlighting and brought its VIP and press areas in line with international standards.

'''Rooms Katholieke Voetbal Vereniging Olympia''', known as '''Olympia''', was a [[Suriname]]se [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Centrum, Paramaribo]] that played in the [[Hoofdklasse (Suriname)|Hoofdklasse]], the highest level of football in Suriname. In 1923 the club became the first official national champion of Suriname.

==History==
Olympia was founded as a [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholic]] club on 27 January 1919, two days after the inauguration of their sporting grounds, the Katholieke Sport Centrale. Situated on the Patronaatterrein, the Katholieke Sport Centrale had been established as a replacement for the Gouvernementsplein as the primary playing field for organized football matches in [[Paramaribo]] at the time.

The club were able to secure the first two official National championships of the [[SVB Hoofdklasse]] in 1923 and 1924. Many of the competing clubs at the time were under the impression that there was a religious bias at the Katholieke Sport Centrale towards the club, and that religious dogma tainted the competition. Olympia played at the top flight of the competition for the most part of the first half of the 20th Century, having seen their best period in the formative years of the sport, relegating to the lower divisions in the sixties, before folding shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/stut004eers01_01/stut004eers01_01_0254.php |title=Voetbal; De eerste Surinaamse sportencyclopedie (1893–1988) |website=dbnl.org|publisher=Alberga, Paramaribo|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racquetball is very similar to 40×20 [[American handball]], which is played in many countries. It is also very similar to the British sport '''Squash 57''', which was called '''racketball''' before 2016 (see [[#Comparison to racketball|below]] for a comparison).

==History==
Joe Sobek is credited with inventing the sport of racquetball in the [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], [[YMCA]], though not with naming it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/31/sports/joseph-sobek-the-inventor-of-racquetball-dies-at-79.html|title=Joseph Sobek, the Inventor Of Racquetball, Dies at 79|first=Frank|last=Litsky|date=31 March 1998|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2018|via=NYTimes.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207142713/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/31/sports/joseph-sobek-the-inventor-of-racquetball-dies-at-79.html|archivedate=7 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A professional [[tennis]] and American handball player, Sobek sought a fast-paced sport that was easy to learn and play. He designed the first strung paddle, devised a set of rules, based on those of [[Squash (sport)|squash]], handball, and paddleball, and named his game ''paddle rackets''.

In February 1952 Sobek founded the National Paddle Rackets Association (NPRA), codified the rules, and had them printed as a booklet. The new sport was rapidly adopted and became popular through Sobek's continual promotion of it; he was aided by the existence of some 40,000 handball courts in the country's [[YMCA]]s and [[Jewish Community Center]]s, wherein racquetball could be played.

In 1969, aided by Robert W. Kendler, the president-founder of the U.S. Handball Association (USHA), the International Racquetball Association (IRA) was founded using the name coined by Bob McInerney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usaracquetball.info/racquetball/Racquetball_Fall_2011/index.html#/32/ |title=How Racquetball Got Its Name |author=Bud Muehleisen |date=Fall 2011 |work=Racquetball |publisher=USA Racquetball |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117073858/http://usaracquetball.info/racquetball/Racquetball_Fall_2011/index.html#/32/ |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a professional tennis player. That same year, the IRA assumed the national championship from the NPRA. In 1973, after a dispute with the IRA board of directors, Kendler formed two other racquetball organizations, yet the IRA remains the sport's dominant organization, recognized by the [[United States Olympic Committee]] as the American national racquetball governing body.

In 1974, the IRA organized the first professional tournament, and is a founding member of the International Racquetball Federation (IRF). Eventually, the IRA became the American Amateur Racquetball Association (AARA); in late 1995, it renamed itself as the United States Racquetball Association (USRA). In 2003, the USRA again renamed itself to USA Racquetball (USAR), to mirror other [[Olympic Games|Olympic sports]] associations, even if Racquetball is not an Olympic sport.

Kendler used his publication ''ACE'' to promote both handball and racquetball. Starting in the 1970s, and aided by the [[physical fitness|fitness]] boom of that decade, the sport's popularity increased to an estimated 3.1 million players by 1974.  Consequent to increased demand, racquetball clubs and courts were founded and built, and sporting goods manufacturers began producing racquetball-specific equipment. This growth continued until the early 1980s, and declining in the decade's latter part when racquet clubs converted to physical fitness clubs, in service to a wider clientele, adding aerobics exercise classes and physical fitness and bodybuilding machines. Since then, the number of has remained steady, an estimated 5.6 million players.

==United Kingdom==
In 1976, Ian D.W. Wright created the sport of racketball based on U.S. racquetball. British racketball is played in a {{convert|32|ft|m|adj=on}} long by {{convert|21|ft|m|adj=on}} wide [[squash (sport)|squash]] court ({{convert|8|ft|m}} shorter and {{convert|1|ft|m}} wider than the U.S. racquetball court), using a smaller, less dynamic ball than the American racquetball. In racketball, the ceiling is out-of-bounds. The racketball is served after a bounce on the floor then struck into play with the racket. Scoring is like [[Squash (sport)|squash]] with point-a-rally scoring of up to 11 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englandsquashandracketball.com/play-squash-and-racketball/rules-of-play/racketball]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210232150/http://www.englandsquashandracketball.com/play-squash-and-racketball/rules-of-play/racketball |date=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Racketball Association]] was formed on 13 February 1984, and confirmed by the [[English Sports Council]] as the sport's governing body on 30 October 1984. The first National Racketball Championship was held in [[London]] on 1 December 1984. The sport is now played in countries where squash is played, [[Australia]], [[Bermuda]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Argentina]], [[Ireland]] and [[Sweden]]. Currently, racketball also is played in parts of [[North America]].

In 1988, the British Racketball Association merged with the Squash Rackets Association. [[England Squash &amp; Racketball]] is now recognised by [[Sport England]] as the English national governing body for the sports of squash and racketball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportengland.org/about_us/recognised_sports.aspx]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520041023/http://www.sportengland.org/about_us/recognised_sports.aspx |date=May 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is now an established UK Racketball Tournament Series consisting of 8 events around the UK, which forms the basis of the national rankings along with the National Racketball championships held annually at The Edgbaston Priory Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englandsquashandracketball.com/competitions/racketball/discipline?page=2&amp;path=%2Fcompetitions%2Fracketball%2Fdiscipline|title=Competitions - England Squash &amp; Racketball|publisher=Englandsquashandracketball.com|accessdate=11 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118171227/http://www.englandsquashandracketball.com/competitions/racketball/discipline?page=2&amp;path=%2Fcompetitions%2Fracketball%2Fdiscipline|archivedate=18 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, World Squash Federation announced an international 're-branding' of racketball as '''Squash 57''', the 57 referring to the diameter of the ball, in order to emphasise both its membership of the 'squash rackets' family, and its distinctiveness from the U.S. racquetball&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsquash.org/ws/squash-57 Squash 57 Announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031085157/http://www.worldsquash.org/ws/squash-57 |date=2016-10-31 }} from WorldSquash.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing bodies==
The International Racquetball Federation (IRF) governs the [[Racquetball World Championships|World Racquetball Championships]], which were first held in 1981 in conjunction with the first [[World Games]]. The second World Championships were played in 1984, and since then have been held biennially in August. Players from the [[United States]] have won the most World Championship titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalracquetball.com/worlds/03worlds.htm|title=IRF World Championships|publisher=Internationalracquetball.com|accessdate=8 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907105317/http://www.internationalracquetball.com/worlds/03worlds.htm|archivedate=7 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRF also runs the World Junior Racquetball Championships that occur annually in either late October, or early to mid November, as well as the annual World Senior Racquetball Championships for players who are  35 years of age or older.

Racquetball has been included in the [[World Games]] on five occasions: 1981, 1989, 1993, 2009 and 2013. The sport has a high appeal in the Americas, and because of this racquetball has been included in the [[Pan American Games]] in [[Racquetball at the 1995 Pan American Games|1995]], [[Racquetball at the 1999 Pan American Games|1999]], [[Racquetball at the 2003 Pan American Games|2003]], [[Racquetball at the 2011 Pan American Games|2011]] and [[Racquetball at the 2015 Pan American Games|2015]]. And will be part of the games again in [[2019 Pan American Games|Lima 2019]].
There are three professional racquetball organizations. The [[International Racquetball Tour]] (IRT) is the men's professional organization that began in the 1980s, with the World Racquetball Tour (WRT) starting more recently.  The [[Ladies Professional Racquetball Tour]] (LPRT) is the women's professional organization.

==Equipment==
This court and equipment are required for playing racquetball:
[[Image:Racquetballcourtdimensions.gif|thumb|300px|right|The court dimensions]]

* A racquetball court &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racquetball Court: Dimensions|url=https://thepickleballpaddle.com/racquetball-court-dimensions/|publisher=The Pickleball Paddle USA Official}}&lt;/ref&gt;; fully enclosed indoor or outdoor with a front wall. The standard racquetball court is [[rectangular]]: 40 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 20 feet high with red lines defining the service and serve reception areas.

The "service box" is formed by the ''short line'' (a solid red line running the court's width parallel to the front and back walls at a distance of 20 feet) and the ''service line'' (which runs parallel to the short line and is 15 feet from the front wall).  Within the service box there are two sets of lines perpendicular to the short and service lines.

One set of lines is 18&amp;nbsp;inches from, and parallel to, the side walls. Along with the short line, service line, and side wall these lines define the doubles box, where the non-serving doubles partner stands during the serve; 36&amp;nbsp;inches from the side wall is another set of lines which, along with the short line and the service line, define an area that the server must not enter if he wishes to hit a drive serve between himself and the nearest side wall.  The ''receiving line'' is a parallel dashed line 5 feet behind the short line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalracquetball.com/00irf_courtspec.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130222620/http://www.internationalracquetball.com/00irf_courtspec.htm |date=January 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other equipment needed:

*A racquetball; a dynamic (bouncy) rubber ball of 2.25 in. (57&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter
*A racquetball racquet; no longer than 22&amp;nbsp;inches
*Racquetball eyeguards (mandatory during competitions; some recreational players play without eyeguards but this is not recommended, as being hit in the eye by the ball can cause permanent vision damage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easterbrook|first1=Michael|title=Prevention of Eye Injuries in Racquet Sports|journal=Ophthalmology Clinics|date=Sep 1, 1999|volume=12|issue=3|pages=367–380|url=http://www.ophthalmology.theclinics.com/article/S0896-1549(05)70114-0/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racquetball differs from other [[racquet sports]] as most competitive players wear a glove on their racquet hand for the purpose of getting a better grip on the racquet (similar to golfers using a glove when driving), but gloves are optional equipment. Also, players usually wear a comfortable short sleeved shirt and shorts, as well as racquetball court shoes designed for enabling quick lateral as well as forward and backward movement.

==Ball colours==
Racquetballs are manufactured in a variety of colors such as blue, green, purple, black, red, and pink, and some are for specific purposes (e.g., outdoor play and indoor play), but the differences are unlikely to matter for recreational play. Beginners are recommended to use a blue ball by Penn, Ektelon, or Wilson. The blue ball is the most commonly used and it is the most neutral ball for average speed and accuracy of contact. Green balls are similar to blue balls. In the United States the main choices of ball are blue and green for tournament play.  In some cases the International Pro Racquetball Tour (IRT) will use a purple Penn HD ball as the official ball. A black ball is often used in tournaments for senior players because the ball is designed to be slower moving and allows for longer rallies. The red ball is the fastest in production, and they are known as Red Ektelon Fireballs. This ball is heavier and allows for a quicker pace. 

Balls do break occasionally, and will lose their bounce over time even without breaking. To keep balls around for a long time it is best to keep them in a room temperature setting and keep them out of extreme cold or heat because this will cause the balls to become less effective and lose their bounce.

==Rules==
Play begins with the serve. The serving player must bounce the ball on the floor once and hit it directly to the front wall, making the ball hit the floor beyond the short line; otherwise the serve counts as a fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usra.org/Default.aspx?PageContentID=177&amp;tabid=839|title=USA Racquetball - Features, Events, Results - Team USA|work=Team USA|accessdate=11 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027095436/http://usra.org/Default.aspx?PageContentID=177&amp;tabid=839|archivedate=27 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball may touch one side wall, but not two, prior to hitting the floor; hitting both side walls after the front wall (but before the floor) is a "three wall serve," and a fault. Also, serving the ball into the front wall so that it rebounds to the back wall without hitting the floor first is a long serve, and a fault.

Other fault serves include a ceiling serve, in which the ball touches the ceiling after the front wall, and serving before the receiving player is ready. Also, the server must wait until the ball passes the short line before stepping out of the service box, otherwise it is a fault serve.

If the server hits the ball directly to any surface other than the front wall the server immediately loses serve regardless of whether it was first or second serve.

After the ball bounces behind the short line, or passes the receiving line, the ball is in play and the opposing player(s) may play it.

Usually, the server is allowed two opportunities (called first serve and second serve) to put the ball into play (two serve rule), although elite level competitions often allow the server only one opportunity (one serve rule).

After a successful serve, players alternate hitting the ball against the front wall. The player returning the hit may allow the ball to bounce once on the floor or hit the ball on the fly. However, once the player returning the shot has hit the ball, it must strike the front wall before striking the floor.  Unlike during the serve, a ball in play may touch as many walls, including the ceiling, as necessary so long as it reaches the front wall without striking the floor.

===Scoring===
If the server wins the rally, then the server scores one point and continues to serve. If the opposing player wins the rally, then no point is scored, but that player then takes over serving.

Under USA Racquetball rules, matches are best of three games with the first two games to 15 points and a third game to 11 points, if necessary. USA Racquetball rules do not require players to win by two, so a match score line could read 15–14, 14–15, 11–10.  Racquetball Canada matches are also the best of three format, but require a winning margin of at least two points.

International competitions run by the International Racquetball Federation are like the USA Racquetball scoring system: two games to 15 with a tie-breaker to 11, if necessary, and win by one. However, the men's and women's pro tours play matches that are the best-of-five games to 11 points, requiring a two-point margin for victory.

===Hinders===
Due to the nature of the game, players often occupy the space their opponent(s) want(s) to occupy. This may result in a player blocking his opponent's ability to play the ball. Such occurrences are termed either hinders or penalty hinders. A hinder is a replay of the current rally (the server resumes play at the first serve), while a penalty hinder results in the player who caused the avoidable obstruction to lose the rally.  A type of hinder is a screen in which the player is unable to see the ball prior to it passing the opponent.

The difference between a hinder and a penalty hinder (or formerly an avoidable hinder) is that in the latter case a player has missed out on a clear opportunity to make a rally-winning shot due to the obstruction by the player's opponent, while in the former case the opportunity missed would not clearly have led to a winning shot. This difference is almost always a judgment call by the referee (if available).

There is also a "court" hinder in which some part of the playing field caused the ball to bounce untrue.  Often this is the door frame or (recessed) handle or a flaw in the floor or walls.  In this case, the rally is a re-serve.

===Game variations===
Racquetball games can be played with two, three or four players, with doubles or singles matches being most common. Two player games are called singles or "one-up" (one vs. one for the entire game), while four player games are doubles with two pairs playing against each other (two vs. two for the entire game).  Tournament competitions have divisions for singles or doubles or both.

Three-player games are most commonly called "Cut-throat" and sometimes "Ironman" (two-on-one for the entire game) where each player takes turns serving to the other two, who play as a team against the serving player. Another three-player game is "California", "In-and-Out", or "King of the Court" where play is 1 vs. 1 with the third player remaining in the back court out of play while the other two play a rally; the rally winner then serves to the player who was sitting out, and the rally loser stays out of play. Another three-player variation is "Sevens" in which one player plays against two players as a team, with the game being played to seven points; if the two player team gets to seven first, the game is over, but if the solo player gets to seven first then the game continues to 14; if the solo player again reaches 14 first, then the game continues to 21, where the game ends regardless of whether the solo player or the two player team reach 21 first.

===Service===
Serve style varies drastically from player to player. Generally, they are divided into two types: offensive and defensive. Most players use an offensive serve for the first serve, and a defensive serve if they need to hit a second serve. Of the offensive serves, the most common is the drive. The intention with this serve is for the ball to travel low and fast towards either back corner, and to bounce twice before striking either side wall or the back wall. If the opponent is adjusting to the drive serve, the server will throw in any variety of jam serves.

A ''jam serve'' is an offensive serve which attempts to catch the opponent off balance by making use of difficult angles and unfrequented play space. The most common jam serve is the Z-serve, which strikes the front wall close to a side wall. The ball bounces quickly off the side wall, then strikes the floor and then the opposite side wall about 30–35 feet back. Depending upon the spin the server gives the Z-serve, the resulting carom may prove unpredictable and difficult to return. Side spin may cause the ball to bounce parallel to the back wall.

A ''pinch serve'' is similar to a drive serve; however, the ball strikes a side wall very low and close to the serving box. With the appropriate spin, the ball has little bounce, and is difficult to return. It is possible that a successful serve would strike the sidewall before the short line, and land on the floor after the short line.

If the player faults on the first serve, they will usually hit a defensive serve. Defensive serves do not usually garner aces, but they are designed to generate a weak return by the opponent, thereby setting up the server to win the point. Most defensive serves are any variety of lob serves. A plain lob serve is a ball hit with a long, high arch into either back corner. The goal is to hit the ball so that it lands as close as possible to the back wall, giving the opponent very little room to hit a solid return. A junk lob takes a shallower arch, and lands close to the side wall somewhere between the dotted line and the back wall. This lob is intended to deceive the opponent into thinking he has an easy kill. However, since the ball is in the deep zone, it will more likely set up the server for an offensive shot.

===Offensive shots===
Straight-in shots are usually meant to hit the front wall as low as possible.  If the ball contacts the front wall so low as to bounce twice before it reaches the service line it is called a "kill" shot.  Straight-in shots are normally attempted with the idea of hitting toward the area of the court the opponent cannot cover.  Straight-in shots hit where the opponent can't return them are called down-the-line and cross court passing shots.  Often kill shots are returned very close to the back wall as the ball is moving towards the front wall.

Pinches and splats are shots that strike the side wall before the front wall.  This often makes the ball bounce twice quickly to end the rally.  Pinches normally strike the side wall towards the front part of the court, often within a few inches from the front wall.

The "splat" shot is an elongated pinch that strikes the side wall towards the back part of the court.  It often makes a distinctive splatting sound. A very disorienting shot named the "rayjay splat" after Ray Johnson, a Wyoming state champion, who consistently used this shot by smashing the ball into the sidewall at such an angle that it would "Z" into the opposite front wall, arriving with such minimum momentum that it would "die" at the front wall and not rebound as expected.  The best defense is to listen for the splat and anticipate the ball action. The advantage to a splat shot, beyond an unpredictable angle, is that it creates a longer distance to travel forward for the opponent who is held between a tension of going forward and staying back because of velocity of passing shots.

Pinches are classified as frontside or reverse.  A [[right-handed]] player shooting a forehand shot to the right front corner is shooting a frontside pinch.  A right-handed player shooting to the left front corner is a reverse pinch.  A right-handed player shoots a backhand frontside pinch to the left corner and a reverse double pinch to the right corner.  Everything for a left-handed player would be the opposite.

The dink is another very effective offensive shot designed to end the point.  It is a shot very low to the front wall hit very softly so as to bounce twice before the opponent can get to it. Dinks are most effective when the opponent is positioned deep in the court.

Another important shot type is the "Z" shot.  This shot is effective at confusing and tiring out your opponent.  To hit a "Z" shot one hits the side wall hard and up high causing the ball to hit the front then the other side wall then back to the original side wall.  If done correctly, the path of the ball will be Z shaped.  This shot can have confusing bounces which can frustrate opponents.  If done correctly, a "Z" shot will apply spin to the ball as well on the final bounce, causing it to rebound perpendicular to the second wall and fall parallel to the back wall, the closer the better.  This makes the "Z" shot very difficult to return.

An interesting and surprise attack shot is the "CB Pinch", named after Charlie Beram, a Colorado state champion who is credited with this unique style.  The CB Pinch occurs where the player responds to a ceiling shot quickly, in front of the service line and right after the floor bounce.  The shot is basically a redirected floor bounce (knee to waist high), where the ball is directed very softly but quickly to either corner from a position in front of the service line.  The fact that the shot is taken right after a ceiling shot-floor bounce usually leaves the opponent in the rear of the court defenseless against the CB Pinch, when the player has suddenly rushed forward to take the shot.

===Defensive shots===
Defensive shots are defined as shots which are not returned low to the front wall.

The ceiling ball shot is the primary defensive shot.  This is a shot that strikes the ceiling at or near the front wall.  The ball will bounce once in the forecourt and should then travel in a high arc to arrive as close to, and as vertical to, the back wall as possible.  Often this is aimed at the corner which would require a backhand return by the opponent.  This makes it difficult for the opponent to return the ball as he cannot make a full arc of the racquet.  However, if the ball comes down too long or too short of the back wall, this can allow the opponent a kill shot.

Another defensive shot is the high Z.  Used when the defensive player is near the front wall, the high Z is hit ten feet high or higher into the front wall near a corner.  The ball then bounces from the side wall all the way to the opposite side wall, usually traveling over the top of the opponent, hitting the opposite side wall with spin.  The spin will cause the ball to leave the opposite wall almost perpendicular to it.  This may confuse inexperienced opponents but importantly, if very close to and parallel to the rear wall, makes for a difficult return shot.

The "around the world" or "3 wall" defensive shot is hit like a pinch shot but high on the wall toward the ceiling. It travels around the court in a high trajectory and is an alternative to hitting a ceiling ball.

Two other defensive shots are used but are less effective.  If the defensive player is in the backcourt but unable to position himself for a non-defensive shot, he may need to hit the ball off of the back wall.  The ball often returns without much force and is easily returned.  The round-the-world shot is hit high into the side wall first so the ball then hits the front wall and then the other side wall, effectively circling the court. It can be easily cut off and is rarely used anymore.

==Strategy==
The primary strategy of racquetball is to command the center of the court just at or behind the dashed receiving line.  This allows the player to move as quickly as possible to all areas of the court and limit open court areas which are difficult to defend.  After a shot, players should return quickly to center court.  The antithesis of this is to be against a wall which severely limits the player's movement and allows the opponent an open court.

Important tactics include keeping an eye on the opponent by glancing sideways to anticipate their return shot, learning the typical return shots of the opponent, and attempting to not be predictable with return shots.

Other more obvious strategies are to keep the returned ball as low on the front wall as possible, keeping the ball moving fast (limiting reaction time) and to keep your opponent moving away from center court by the use of lobs, cross court shots, and dinks.

== Major competitions and players ==
Organized competitive racquetball began in the 1970s. The best male players of that era were [[Charlie Brumfield]] and [[Marty Hogan (racquetball player)|Marty Hogan]], as well as [[Bud Muehleisen]], Jerry Hilecher, [[Steven 'Bo' Keeley|Steve Keeley]], Davey Bledsoe, Steve Serot,  and Steve Strandemo. Hogan continued to be a dominant player into the 1980s, and was rivaled on the scene by Brett Harnett, Dave Peck, and Mike Yellen.

In the 1990s, Ruben Gonzalez, [[Cliff Swain]] and [[Sudsy Monchik]] dominated pro tournaments, and other great players like Andy Roberts, John Ellis, and Drew Kachtik were often left out of the winner's circle. In the 2000s, [[Kane Waselenchuk]], [[Jack Huczek]], [[Jason Mannino]], [[Ben Croft]], and [[Rocky Carson]] have all excelled, but Waselenchuk has been dominant the last two seasons losing only once since September 2008.

The first great woman player was Peggy Steding in the 1970s. She was succeeded by Shannon Wright, who was then rivaled by [[Heather McKay]], a great Australian squash player who made the transition to racquetball when living in Canada. McKay then developed a great rivalry with [[Lynn Adams]], and after McKay moved back to Australia, Adams dominated women's racquetball for the better part of the 1980s.

The 1990s belonged to [[Michelle Gould (racquetball player)|Michelle Gould]] (née Gilman) whose drive serve was a huge weapon against her opponents. In the late 1990s and into the 2000s, [[Jackie Paraiso]] and then [[Cheryl Gudinas]] were the dominant players. Then in the mid-2000s, [[Christie Van Hees]] and [[Rhonda Rajsich]] were the dominant players, but [[Paola Longoria]] finished #1 at the end of the 2008–2009 and 2009–2010 seasons.

===US Open===
Held annually in October, the [[US Open Racquetball Championships|US Open]] is the most prestigious professional racquetball event. First held in 1996, the US Open was in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]] until 2010, when it moved to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]. In men's play, [[Kane Waselenchuk]] (Canada) has won the most US Open titles with thirteen ahead of [[Sudsy Monchik]] (US) with four,  while [[Jason Mannino]] (US) and [[Cliff Swain]] (US) have both won the title twice, and [[Rocky Carson]] (US) once.

In women's play, [[Paola Longoria]] (Mexico) has the most US Open titles with five, [[Rhonda Rajsich]] (US) has four, one more than  [[Christie Van Hees]] (Canada)  with three. [[Michelle Gould (racquetball player)|Michelle Gould]] (US), [[Cheryl Gudinas]] (US), and [[Jackie Paraiso]] (US) have each won two US Open titles. [[Kerri Wachtel]] (US) won the title once.

===Other championships===
Racquetball is included in the [[Pan American Games]], [[World Games]] and [[Central American and Caribbean Games]]. Also, the regional associations of the International Racquetball Federation organize their own continental championships: Asian Championships, [[European Racquetball Championships|European Championships]] and [[Pan American Racquetball Championships|Pan American Championships]].

==Comparison to racketball==
Racquetball is very similar to the British sport of 'racketball', which was patterned on racquetball in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobbystop.net/Racquetball/Differences_Between_Racquetball_And_Racketball.html|title=Racquetball: Differences Between Racquetball And Racketball - HobbyStop|publisher=Hobbystop.net|accessdate=11 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214202846/http://www.hobbystop.net/Racquetball/Differences_Between_Racquetball_And_Racketball.html|archivedate=14 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main differences are that the British ball is smaller, denser, and less bouncy; the British sport's court is a squash court, which is substantially shorter and somewhat wider; and the ceiling in the British game is out of bounds.

'''Stade Félix Houphouët-Boigny''', nicknamed '''Le Félicia''', is a multi-purpose stadium, which can host football, rugby union and [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], in [[Abidjan]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]]. It is the national stadium of the [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team]]. It is named after the first president of the country, [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], and is located in the commune of [[Plateau, Ivory Coast|Le Plateau]]. The stadium has a capacity of 45,000.&lt;ref name="stadiumzone.weebly.com"&gt;http://stadiumzone.weebly.com/&lt;/ref&gt; It also hosts matches of the [[ASEC Abidjan]]. It has been the site of several deadly stampedes.

==History==
Built in 1964 to organize the "Games of Abidjan", the stadium was formerly known as '''Stade Andre Geo''', and it took the name of the President Felix Houphouet-Boigny after undergoing restoration.

Gradually it emerged as the National Stadium, hosting the ASEC Mimosas and Ivorian Soccer Team.

Along the Stadium of Peace of Bouake, Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny hosted Africa Cup of Nations soccer. In 2009 after a complete renovation, which included lawn seating and the treatment room, the stadium hosted the [[2009 African Championship of Nations]].

The stadium was renovated for the [[2017 Jeux de la Francophonie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abidjan2017.ci/index.php/abidjan2017/competitions-sportives/105-cnjf-en-action/379-chantiers-des-jeux-de-la-francophonie|title=CHANTIERS DES JEUX DE LA FRANCOPHONIE (French)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium played host to [[Amnesty International]]'s [[Human Rights Now!]] Benefit Concert on October 9, 1988. The show was headlined by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Peter Gabriel]] and also featured [[Bruce Springsteen]] &amp; The [[E Street Band]], [[Tracy Chapman]] and [[Youssou N'Dour]].

The American singer [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]] finished his [[Carpe Diem Tour]] at this stadium on December 30, 2012.

The stadium is expected to host many matches of the [[2021 Africa Cup of Nations]]. It will also be renovated for this competition by [[Mota-Engil]].

===Incidents===
On March 29, 2009, during the match between Ivory Coast and Malawi, the gateway to an open corner of the stadium gave way before the kick-off of the match. [[2009 Houphouët-Boigny stampede|A stampede ensued]] when 19 people were killed by trampling. Over 130 were injured as well.

On January 1, 2013, following a New Year's Eve fireworks display, [[2013 Houphouët-Boigny stampede|another stampede]] took place, in which sixty-one lives were claimed, with upwards of 200 injuries sustained.&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;{{cite web | last = Bakayoko | first = Inza | url = http://world.time.com/2013/01/01/ivory-coast-new-years-stampede-kills-61/ | title = Stampede After Fireworks Kills 61 in Ivory Coast | date = 2013-01-01 | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate = 2013-01-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130104104107/http://world.time.com/2013/01/01/ivory-coast-new-years-stampede-kills-61/ | archivedate = 2013-01-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The bleachers painted in national colors consist of curves, the gallery lagoon side of the podium, a gallery and a presidential box, VIP, and BVIP .

The stage contains a media room, a room control used for anti-doping, a VIP room, a treatment room, offices of arbitrators, a massage room, and four dressing rooms.

The stadium has a video board 220 volts for 35 kwh, 16.50 meters by 5.70 meters.

The lawn is of international standard and is maintained daily green and glowing.

The '''Superior Dome''', which opened as the "world’s largest wooden [[dome]]" on September 14, 1991,&lt;ref name=hunts&gt;{{cite web |first1= Mary |last1= Hunt |first2= Don |last2= Hunt |title= Superior Dome |url= http://hunts-upguide.com/marquette_superior_dome.html |work= Hunt's Guide to the Upper Peninsula |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a domed [[stadium]] on the campus of [[Northern Michigan University]] in [[Marquette, Michigan]], in the United States. It is home to the [[Northern Michigan Wildcats|Northern Michigan Wildcat]] [[American football|football]] team as well as their Marching Band, and a variety of other campus and community events.

The dome is {{convert|143|ft|m|sp=us}} tall, has a diameter of {{convert|536|ft|m}}, covers an area of {{convert|5.1|acres|m2}}, and has a volume of 16,135,907 cubic feet. It is a [[geodesic dome]] constructed with 781&amp;nbsp;[[Douglas Fir]] beams and {{convert|108.5|mi|km}} of fir decking. The dome is designed to support snow up to {{convert|60|psf|kPa}} and withstand {{convert|80|mph|km/h|adj=on}} winds. It has a permanent [[seating capacity]] of 8,000, though the building can hold as many as 16,000 people. The 2010 edition of ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' listed it as the fifth-largest dome and largest wooden dome in the world.&lt;ref name=nmu&gt;{{cite web|title=Superior Dome|url=http://www.nmu.edu/SuperiorDome|publisher=Northern Michigan University|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The construction was finished in two phases. Phase I was finished in August 1991 and included the construction of the domed complex. Phase II, completed in May 1995, added locker rooms, department offices, meeting rooms, concession areas, a retail store and other building amenities. Phase I of the project cost $21.8 million and was funded entirely by the State of [[Michigan]]. Phase II was completed for $2.1 million, with $800,000 in private donations and $1.3 million in loans. Total cost for the Superior Dome stands at $23.9 million.

[[File:Nmu.JPG|thumb|left|Inside of Superior Dome with turf laid out]]
The Wildcat football team was the first to christen the Dome, hosting the first-ever event in the facility on September 14, 1991. Northern defeated [[University of Indianapolis|Indianapolis]], 31–20, in front of a crowd of 7,942. Later that season, a Superior Dome attendance record was set at 8,432, when Northern defeated [[Ferris State University|Ferris State]], 27–17, on October 5. On September 18, 2008, a new attendance record was set as 8,672 watched Northern Michigan University lose to the [[Michigan Tech Huskies]] in a televised game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nmuwildcats.com/sports/fball/2008-09/releases/20130220tntv8v&lt;/ref&gt;

The dome features a retractable artificial turf carpet, the largest of its kind in the world. When extended, the turf can accommodate [[American football|football]], [[football (soccer)|soccer]], and [[field hockey]]. Underneath the carpet is a synthetic playing surface that features three basketball/volleyball courts, two tennis courts and a {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} track. The carpet is winched in and out of place on a cushion of air. Retracting the turf carpet takes 30 minutes, with full setup taking approximately two hours.&lt;ref name=nmu/&gt;

The Superior Dome is also host to a number of campus and community events, including [[Michigan High School Athletic Association]] football regular season and playoff games, trade shows (approximately {{convert|100000|sqft|m2}} of space), conventions, conferences, banquets, high school track meets, the Upper Peninsula "[[Band Day]]" competition/exhibition, [[Special Olympics]], and NMU’s commencement exercises, to name a few.

President [[George W. Bush]] held a campaign rally in the stadium during the 2004 Presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bush|first=George W.|title=Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States, George W.

'''Surf Stadium''' is a 5,500-seat baseball stadium in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] that opened in 1998 and has been mostly closed since 2009, although some renovation was performed in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref name=youthtournament/&gt; The stadium was officially renamed as '''Surf Stadium''' in April 2012, and hosted a few events in 2012.&lt;ref name=officialsurf/&gt; The stadium was called '''The Sandcastle''' until 2006, and has continued to be referred to by that name in some sources.&lt;ref name=officialsurf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Concert2011/&gt; It was built as the home of the [[Atlantic City Surf]] baseball team, which discontinued operations prior to the 2009 season. College and youth&lt;ref name=youthtournament&gt;[http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/communities/atlantic-city_pleasantville_brigantine/baseball-is-back-at-atlantic-city-s-surf-stadium-with/article_826bd650-dce9-11e1-bd5a-0019bb2963f4.html Baseball is back at Atlantic City's Surf Stadium with start of Babe Ruth tournament], ''[[Press of Atlantic City]]'', Aug. 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; teams have also used the stadium, and a music concert was held there in 2011.

The stadium is located on Albany Avenue, near the eastern terminus of [[U.S. Route 40 in New Jersey|U.S. Routes 40]] and [[U.S. Route 322 in New Jersey|322]] and several blocks inland from the [[Boardwalk#Atlantic City, New Jersey|Boardwalk]] and [[casino]] strip. The casinos are visible from the seating areas.

Seating is in two primary sections, split by a "cross aisle". Luxury boxes are located above the main seating bowl. 

It is now the home stadium of the Atlantic Cape Community College Buccaneers baseball team.

==History==
The stadium, originally known as The Sandcastle, opened in 1998 on a parcel located on the sprawling [[Bader Field]], a closed municipal airport. When the park first opened, the seating sections were named for the various properties on the U.S. version of the [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] board, which took its names from the streets of Atlantic City and surrounding towns. However, saying "I'm sitting in Pacific Avenue" was not sufficiently descriptive, and so the seating sections were assigned numbers, as at most other stadiums. In 2006, the Bernie Robbins jewelry chain purchased the naming rights and the stadium was renamed as "Bernie Robbins Stadium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jeweler Buys Local Stadium Naming Rights | date=May 23, 2006 | work=6abc.com | publisher=[[WPVI-TV]] | url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/sports&amp;id=4196678 | accessdate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sand Stadium (then known as Bernie Robbins Stadium) played host to the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]] All-Star Game in 1998 and 2005 as well as to various amateur baseball events and concerts. In October 2006, it was the venue for [[2008 Rugby League World Cup qualifying|Atlantic regional qualifying]] for the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup]]. In May 2008, [[WCAU-TV]] sports director and former [[NFL]] player [[Vai Sikahema]] accepted an open challenge from former [[MLB]] player [[Jose Canseco]] to fight him in a celebrity boxing match for $5,000. Canseco claims to have earned black belts in [[Kung Fu]], [[Taekwondo]], and [[Muay Thai]], while Sikahema, who grew up wanting to be a professional boxer, had once fought in a National Golden Gloves Championship that was eventually won by [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]. The fight, dubbed the "War At The Shore", took place on July 12, 2008, and was hosted by Philadelphia-native adult film personality Steven Sheaffer. Sikahema won by knockout in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc10.com/news/16866470/detail.html "Vai Wins War At The Shore"], NBC10.com, July 13, 2008. Accessed July 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the stadium closed, its condition seriously deteriorated due to lack of maintenance and vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Battered up!

'''Verdun Auditorium''' is an [[arena]] located in the [[Montreal]] borough of [[Verdun, Quebec|Verdun]], [[Quebec]], Canada. The building was constructed in 1938 and holds 4,114. The largest arena in the west end of Montreal, the complex is also home to Arena Denis Savard, a small minor-hockey rink, attached to its side. The Auditorium has hosted various [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] teams, including the [[Verdun Juniors]], [[Verdun Éperviers]] and [[Verdun Collège Français]]. In 1993 it also hosted the [[Montreal Dragons]] for its lone season in the short lived [[National Basketball League (1993-94 Canadian league)|National Basketball League]]. It is slated to become the home arena of [[Les Canadiennes de Montreal]] in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/les-canadiennes-to-move-into-the-verdun-auditorium-in-2019&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2008, the QMJHL approved the sale of the [[St. John's Fog Devils]] to [[Montreal]] businessman [[Farrel Miller]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lhjmq.qc.ca/lang_en/index.php?page=232&amp;id_nouvelle=1667 QMJHL set to return to Montreal next season]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; who relocated the team to Montreal, where it was known as the [[Montreal Junior Hockey Club]]. In the summer of 2011, the team moved to [[Boisbriand, Quebec|Boisbriand]] to become the [[Blainville-Boisbriand Armada]].

The auditorium also received the American punk band Nirvana on November 2, 1993. This was the band's last show in Montreal before frontman Kurt Cobain died five months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livenirvana.com/dvd/1993/dvd_11-02-93.php Nirvana at Auditorium de Verdun 11/02/93]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veterans Memorial Stadium''' (also known as '''Veterans Stadium''', '''Vets Stadium''' or simply '''The Vet''') is an 11,600-seat stadium located south of the Liberal Arts Campus of [[Long Beach City College]] in [[Long Beach, California]]. It is the home stadium to a number of local area high school football teams, as well as [[Long Beach City College]]'s football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veterans Memorial Stadium|publisher=lbcc.edu|url=https://www.lbcc.edu/contact/veterans-memorial-stadium |accessdate=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also home to [[Long Beach State 49ers football|Long Beach State]]'s football team until the program disbanded in 1991.&lt;ref name="December 11, 1991"&gt;{{cite news| last =Woolard| first =John| title =Football gets sacked at CSULB| work =The Long Beach Press-Telegram| date =December 11, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is also popular as a movie set for a number of [[Hollywood]] [[motion picture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Popular Titles With Location Matching "Veterans Memorial Stadium|publisher=imdb.com|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Veterans%20Memorial%20Stadium%20-%20508%20E.%20Lew%20Davis%20Street,%20Long%20Beach,%20California,%20USA|accessdate=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also hosted the 1985 and 1988 Motorcycle [[Speedway World Team Cup]] Finals.

==History==
Veterans Stadium opened in 1948, and was owned by the City of Long Beach for a number of decades. The City of Long Beach used the stadium as a temporary location for Fire Station 19 (now located on Clark Avenue, a few blocks away). The fire station was housed at the south end of the stadium under the bleacher area; the large door that was installed for the fire engine to exit can still be seen. The actual "station", or living quarters area, is now used as an office for stadium personnel.

Soon after the stadium opened, the [[Los Angeles Bulldogs]] of the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]] became the Long Beach Bulldogs for the 1948 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://profootballresearchers.com/archives/Website_Files/Coffin_Corner/05-04-135.pdf  The End of the PCPFL] – Bob Gill, Pro Football Research Association (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; But the minor-league PCPFL was on its last legs by this time, and so were the Bulldogs—a legendary West Coast team that had fallen on hard times since the NFL [[Los Angeles Rams]] and the [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]]'s [[Los Angeles Dons]] moved to town. After drawing just 850 fans for a Bulldogs game in Long Beach, the team promptly cancelled the rest of their schedule, and the PCPFL folded soon after.

Two decades later, in 1967, the Vet hosted professional football again. The [[Long Beach Admirals]] were admitted to the [[Continental Football League]] as part of the league's expansion to the west coast. But the Admirals wouldn't last long: they drew only 2,475 fans for an exhibition game, then just 950 customers for their regular season opener, a 37-13 loss to the [[Seattle Rangers]]. After the disastrous gates, the Admirals applied for an immediate transfer to [[Portland, Oregon]]; this was denied, and the Admirals sank beneath the waves.

In 1987, Long Beach City College acquired Veterans Stadium from the City of Long Beach, and in the 1990s, the college upgraded the stadium for use by local high school football teams. One of the most memorable football contests held at the stadium involved [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School]] and Lakewood High School, drawing over 11,500 spectators and regional television coverage. Veterans Stadium is currently the home stadium to the Long Beach Poly Jackrabbits and the [[Los Alamitos High School]] Griffins.

===Speedway===
During the 1980s the stadium also doubled as a [[Motorcycle speedway]] venue. The speedway track was laid out over the stadiums existing {{convert|400|m|yd}} athletics track with additional banking in the corners to allow for faster racing. As well as hosting the World Team Cup Final in [[1985 Speedway World Team Cup|1985]] and [[1988 Speedway World Team Cup|1988]] (both won by [[Denmark national speedway team|Denmark]] with the [[United States national speedway team|USA]] finishing second), the stadium played host to numerous American Finals which were then qualifying rounds for the [[Speedway World Championship]] during the decade. Some of the riders to have raced at the stadium include Individual World Champions [[Bruce Penhall]] and [[Sam Ermolenko]] (USA), [[Erik Gundersen]] and [[Hans Nielsen (speedway rider)|Hans Nielsen]] ([[Denmark]]), [[Per Jonsson]] ([[Sweden]]) and [[Gary Havelock]] ([[England]]), as well as a host of top class riders such as Americans [[Shawn Moran|Shawn]] and [[Kelly Moran (speedway rider)|Kelly Moran]], [[Bobby Schwartz]] and [[Scott Autrey]]. Veterans is also the site where [[Dennis Sigalos]] ended his career with a badly broken leg following a crash in the 1984 American Final.

===Rugby League===
Probably the most historically notable football contest at this stadium involved a completely different code—[[rugby league]]. In [[1987 Rugby League State of Origin series|1987]], after the three regular matches in the [[Australia]]n [[State of Origin series]] between the states of [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] and [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]], the two teams went to Long Beach for a fourth match, drawing an announced crowd of 12,439 to see New South Wales win 30–18. The canonicity of the match [[Rugby League State of Origin#1987: American controversy|has been in dispute]] ever since. While all Australian authorities count the match for purposes of individual player statistics, not all of them include it in official team records. Sources in [[New South Wales]], including the [[Australian Rugby League]] and its successor, the [[Australian Rugby League Commission]], officially count the match result; those within the [[Queensland Rugby League]] do not.

In 2004, Veterans Stadium received another upgrade. A new [[SprinTurf]] playing surface replaced the old playing surface in time for the 2004 football season.

===Soccer===
Veterans Memorial Stadium hosted a match in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification]].

==About Veterans Stadium==
===The basics===
Veterans Stadium seats 11,600, and are on one side of the stadium, a grandstand facing east. 7,000 of the seats are aluminum bench bleachers, with the other 4,600 seats having fixed chairbacks. The field is surrounded by a nine-lane, 400-meter track.

===Location===
The stadium is located on Lew Davis Street between Clark Avenue and Faculty Avenue. It is three miles west of Interstate 605 (use the Carson Street exit) and two miles north of Interstate 405 (use the Lakewood Boulevard exit or the Bellflower Boulevard exit).

===Technical information===
The field is open at both ends and there is a practice field on the north side and a large parking lot on the south side. There are large locker rooms for both home and visiting teams in the stadium and a smaller room for game officials. There are lights for night play using [[metal-halide lamp]]s on eight towers. Veterans Stadium also features a two-level press box (capacity 100) atop the west grandstand.

Spectator amenities include 4,000 surface parking spaces, two ticket booths with two windows each, three permanent concessions, and a combined message board and scoreboard.

The '''Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium''' ({{lang-mr|विदर्भ क्रिकेट असोसिएशन स्टेडियम}}) also known as '''New VCA''' stadium is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Nagpur]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. It is the largest cricket stadium in [[India]] in terms of field area.

The ground, located at Jamtha on the southern outskirts of Nagpur, was inaugurated in 2008, replacing the old [[Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground]] as the city's main stadium. The qualities of the stadium have been praised by the [[International Cricket Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-02/top-stories/28322831_1_host-third-vca-stadium-wankhede-stadium Nagpur likely to host third India-New Zealand Test – Times Of India]. Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com (2010-07-02). Retrieved on 2013-12-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

VCA Stadium is the home ground for the [[Vidarbha cricket team|Vidarbha]] and [[Central Zone cricket team|Central Zone]] teams for the domestic [[Ranji Trophy]] and [[Duleep Trophy]] tournaments, respectively. As of 19 August 2017 it has hosted five [[Test cricket|Tests]], seven ODIs and 11 T20Is.

==Overview==
[[File:VCA.svg|thumb|Layout of the VCA Stadium]]

[[Sachin Tendulkar]] said "the facilities exceeded all expectations" and [[Ricky Ponting]] commented on the comfort in the changing rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indvaus2008/content/story/377218.html|title=Spectator-friendly minus the spectators|work=Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Rajasthan Royals]] skipper [[Shane Warne]] was extremely pleased with the "largeness of the ground" after his team’s two-run win over [[Deccan Chargers]]. "[[Michael Lumb (cricketer)|Michael Lumb]]'s slog to deep mid-wicket found a fielder. Now, if this was [[M. A. Chidambaram Stadium]] or [[M. Chinnaswamy Stadium]], then that ball would have landed in a taxi going to the team hotel. We need big grounds like these," Warne said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report-bowlers-in-with-a-chance-at-the-vca-stadium-in-nagpur-1370289 Bowlers in with a chance at the VCA stadium in Nagpur – Sport – DNA]. Dnaindia.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-23.&lt;/ref&gt; It has 80-yard straight boundaries and 85-yard square boundaries, which makes it one of the largest grounds (in terms of playing area) in the world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.bcci.tv/bcci/bccitv/community/venues/venue/4d1dd0ab8f09d ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102005833/http://www.bcci.tv/bcci/bccitv/community/venues/venue/4d1dd0ab8f09d |date=2 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lalit Modi]] said the VCA was "by far the best stadium in India". The stadium has been praised not only by the players but also by commentators and journalists because of the facilities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Alan Wilkins (cricketer)|Alan Wilkins]] said, "It is a fabulous stadium, a Colosseum here in [[Nagpur]]. It has the most impressive [[Press box]] for the travelling media. It really is a wonderful venue."

The first international match at this venue was the Fourth Test between [[India cricket team|India]] and [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] in November 2008, which India won by 172 runs. The Australian spinner [[Jason Krejza]] finished with 12 wickets, while [[Harbhajan Singh]] claimed seven for India.

Four matches were played at the stadium during the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/events_and_awards/CWC/fixtures.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110075851/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/events_and_awards/CWC/fixtures.php |archivedate=10 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The highest Test scores are by India: 566/8, 558/6 and 441.

'''Woodcar Independent Racing League''' (WIRL) is an independent racing league for pinewood car builders.

Pinewood car racing was popularized by the well known [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] sanctioned [[Pinewood Derby]]. Unlike the Scout races, WIRL races are open to people of all ages and participants are not required to be a member of any particular organization. To compete in WIRL racing events, cars are sent to a central location where they are raced together on the same track. Cars can race for one year under one of four sets of rules:  Rookie,&lt;ref name="wirlracing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wirlracing.com/rookie.shtml|title=WIRL Racing Official Site...Events|author=WIRL|publisher=wirlracing.com|accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure Stock,&lt;ref name="wirlracing2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wirlracing.com/pure-stock.shtml|title=WIRL Racing Official Site...Pure Stock|author=WIRL|publisher=wirlracing.com|accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro Stock&lt;ref name="wirlracing3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wirlracing.com/pro-stock.shtml|title=WIRL Racing Official Site...Events|author=WIRL|publisher=wirlracing.com|accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Modified.&lt;ref name="wirlracing4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wirlracing.com/Modified.shtml|title=WIRL Racing Official Site...Modified|author=WIRL|publisher=wirlracing.com|accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
