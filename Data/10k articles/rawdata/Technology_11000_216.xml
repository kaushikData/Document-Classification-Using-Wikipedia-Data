'''Altera Hardware Description Language''' ('''AHDL''') is a proprietary [[hardware description language]] (HDL) developed by [[Altera Corporation]]. AHDL is used for [[digital logic]] design entry for Altera's [[complex programmable logic device]]s (CPLDs) and [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs). It is supported by Altera's MAX-PLUS and [[Altera Quartus|Quartus]] series of design software. AHDL has an [[Ada programming language|Ada]]-like syntax and its feature set is comparable to the synthesizable portions of the [[Verilog]] and [[VHDL]] hardware description languages. In contrast to HDLs such as Verilog and VHDL, AHDL is a design-entry language only; all of its language constructs are synthesizable. By default, Altera software expects AHDL source files to have a .tdf extension (Text Design Files).

==Example==
&lt;pre&gt;
% a simple AHDL up counter, released to public domain 13 November 2006 %
% [block quotations achieved with percent sign] %
% like c, ahdl functions must be prototyped %

% PROTOTYPE:
 FUNCTION COUNTER (CLK)
	RETURNS (CNTOUT[7..0]); %

% function declaration, where inputs, outputs, and
bidirectional pins are declared %
% also like c, square brackets indicate an array %

SUBDESIGN COUNTER
(
	CLK		:INPUT;
	CNTOUT[7..0]	:OUTPUT;
)

% variables can be anything from flip-flops (as in this case),
tri-state buffers, state machines, to user defined functions %

VARIABLE
	TIMER[7..0]: DFF;

% as with all hardware description languages, think of this
 less as an algorithm and more as wiring nodes together %

BEGIN
	DEFAULTS

		TIMER[].prn = VCC; %  this takes care of d-ff resets %
		TIMER[].clrn = VCC;
	END DEFAULTS;

	TIMER[].d = TIMER[].q + H"1";
END;

&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Anaerobic digestion''' is a collection of processes by which [[microorganisms]] break down [[biodegradable]] material in the absence of [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name="nnfcc"&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-renewable-fuels-and-energy-factsheet-anaerobic-digestion "NNFCC Renewable Fuels and Energy Factsheet: Anaerobic Digestion"], Retrieved on 2011-11-22&lt;/ref&gt; The process is used for industrial or domestic purposes to [[Waste management|manage waste]] or to produce fuels. Much of the [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] used industrially to produce food and drink products, as well as home fermentation, uses anaerobic digestion.

Anaerobic [[digestion]] occurs naturally in some soils and in lake and [[oceanic basin]] [[sediment]]s, where it is usually referred to as "anaerobic activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Koyama, Tadashiro|year=1963|title=Gaseous metabolism in lake sediments and paddy soils and the production of atmospheric methane and hydrogen|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=68|issue=13|pages=3971–3973|doi=10.1029/JZ068i013p03971|bibcode=1963JGR....68.3971K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Pamatmat, Mario Macalalag|author2=Bhagwat, Ashok M.|year=1973|title=Anaerobic metabolism in Lake Washington sediments|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=18|issue=4|pages=611&amp;ndash;627|url=http://aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_18/issue_4/0611.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216221344/http://aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_18/issue_4/0611.pdf|archivedate=16 December 2013|deadurl=yes|doi=10.4319/lo.1973.18.4.0611|df=dmy-all|bibcode=1973LimOc..18..611P}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the source of [[Methane#Occurrence|marsh gas methane]] as discovered by [[Alessandro Volta]] in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zehnder, Alexander J. B.|year=1978|chapter=Ecology of methane formation|editor=Mitchell, Ralph|title=Water pollution microbiology 2|location=New York|publisher=Wiley|pages=349–376|isbn=978-0-471-01902-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=MacGregor, A.

The digestion process begins with [[bacteria]]l [[hydrolysis]] of the input materials. Insoluble [[organic polymer]]s, such as [[carbohydrate]]s, are broken down to soluble derivatives that become available for other bacteria. [[Acidogenesis|Acidogenic bacteria]] then convert the [[sugar]]s and [[amino acid]]s into carbon dioxide, [[hydrogen]], [[ammonia]], and [[organic acid]]s. These bacteria convert these resulting organic acids into [[acetic acid]], along with additional ammonia, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Finally, [[methanogen]]s convert these products to methane and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waste.nl/content/download/472/3779/file/WB89-InfoSheet(Anaerobic%20Digestion).pdf Anaerobic digestion reference sheet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005194523/http://www.waste.nl/content/download/472/3779/file/WB89-InfoSheet(Anaerobic%20Digestion).pdf |date=5 October 2011 }}, waste.nl. Retrieved 25.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; The methanogenic archaea populations play an indispensable role in anaerobic wastewater treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359511310001984 | doi=10.1016/j.procbio.2010.05.017 | volume=45 | issue=8 | title=Importance of the methanogenic archaea populations in anaerobic wastewater treatments | year=2010 | journal=Process Biochemistry | pages=1214–1225 | last1 = Tabatabaei | first1 = Meisam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaerobic digestion is used as part of the process to treat biodegradable waste and [[sewage sludge]]. As part of an integrated [[waste management]] system, anaerobic digestion reduces the emission of [[landfill gas]] into the atmosphere. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with purpose-grown energy crops, such as [[maize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/biogas/agricultural-biogas/ Agricultural Biogas], www.clarke-energy.com, accessed 08.11.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaerobic digestion is widely used as a source of [[renewable energy]]. The process produces a [[biogas]], consisting of [[methane]], [[carbon dioxide]], and traces of other ‘contaminant’ gases.&lt;ref name="nnfcc" /&gt; This biogas can be used directly as fuel, in combined heat and power gas engines&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.co.uk/gas_engines.html GE Jenbacher Biogas Engines], www.clarke-energy.com, accessed 15.04.11&lt;/ref&gt; or upgraded to natural gas-quality [[biomethane]]. The nutrient-rich [[digestate]] also produced can be used as [[fertilizer]].

With the re-use of waste as a resource and new technological approaches that have lowered [[capital costs]], anaerobic digestion has in recent years received increased attention among governments in a number of countries, among these the United Kingdom (2011),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/anaerobic-digestion-strat-action-plan.pdf Anaerobic Digestion Strategy and Action Plan], defra.gov.uk. Accessed 19.01.2012&lt;/ref&gt; Germany&lt;ref&gt;(source needed)&lt;/ref&gt; and Denmark (2011).&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=da&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fjp.dk%2Findland%2Farticle2649820.ece Jyllands-Posten 29.

Many microorganisms affect anaerobic digestion, including acetic acid-forming [[bacteria]] ([[acetogen]]s) and methane-forming [[archaea]] ([[methanogen]]s). These organisms promote a number of chemical processes in converting the biomass to [[biogas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]].

Gaseous oxygen is excluded from the reactions by physical containment. Anaerobes utilize electron acceptors from sources other than oxygen gas. These acceptors can be the organic material itself or may be supplied by inorganic [[oxide]]s from within the input material. When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system is derived from the organic material itself, the 'intermediate' end products are primarily [[alcohol]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and organic acids, plus carbon dioxide. In the presence of specialised methanogens, the intermediates are converted to the 'final' end products of methane, carbon dioxide, and trace levels of [[hydrogen sulfide]].&lt;ref&gt;''Adapted from'' Beychok, M. (1967) [[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]], First edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, [[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]&lt;/ref&gt; In an anaerobic system, the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane.&lt;ref name="Fergusen, T. 2006 p49" /&gt;

Populations of anaerobic microorganisms typically take a significant period of time to establish themselves to be fully effective. Therefore, common practice is to introduce anaerobic microorganisms from materials with existing populations, a process known as "seeding" the digesters, typically accomplished with the addition of sewage sludge or cattle slurry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80434e/80434E0k.htm The biogas plant], unu.edu.

===Process stages===
The four key stages of anaerobic digestion involve [[hydrolysis]], [[acidogenesis]], [[acetogenesis]] and [[methanogenesis]].&lt;ref name="Anaerobic digestion" /&gt;
The overall process can be described by the chemical reaction, where organic material such as glucose is biochemically digested into carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) by the anaerobic microorganisms.
&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid; max-width: 450px;"&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → 3CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

* '''Hydrolysis'''
In most cases, biomass is made up of large organic polymers. For the bacteria in anaerobic digesters to access the energy potential of the material, these chains must first be broken down into their smaller constituent parts. These constituent parts, or monomers, such as sugars, are readily available to other bacteria. The process of breaking these chains and dissolving the smaller molecules into solution is called hydrolysis. Therefore, hydrolysis of these high-molecular-weight polymeric components is the necessary first step in anaerobic digestion.&lt;ref&gt;Sleat, R. &amp; Mah, R. (2006) Hydrolytic Bacteria ''in'' Anaerobic digestion of biomass, p15&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[hydrolysis]] the complex organic molecules are broken down into [[simple sugar]]s, amino acids, and [[fatty acid]]s.

Acetate and hydrogen produced in the first stages can be used directly by methanogens. Other molecules, such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs) with a chain length greater than that of acetate must first be [[catabolised]] into compounds that can be directly used by methanogens.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, D. &amp; Mah, R. (2006) Transitional bacteria in anaerobic digestion of biomass, p35&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Acidogenesis'''
The biological process of [[acidogenesis]] results in further breakdown of the remaining components by acidogenic (fermentative) bacteria. Here, VFAs are created, along with ammonia, carbon dioxide, and [[hydrogen sulfide]], as well as other byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sop.inria.fr/relation_ext/slides/water_treatment.pdf What is anaerobic digestion], sop.inria.fr. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of acidogenesis is similar to the way [[sour milk|milk sours]].

* '''Acetogenesis'''
The third stage of anaerobic digestion is [[acetogenesis]]. Here, simple molecules created through the acidogenesis phase are further digested by acetogens to produce largely acetic acid, as well as carbon dioxide and hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biotank.co.uk/anaerobic_digestion.htm Anaerobic digestion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012031436/http://www.biotank.co.uk/anaerobic_digestion.htm |date=12 October 2007 }}, biotank.co.uk. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Methanogenesis'''
The terminal stage of anaerobic digestion is the biological process of [[methanogenesis]]. Here, methanogens use the intermediate products of the preceding stages and convert them into methane, carbon dioxide, and water. These components make up the majority of the biogas emitted from the system. Methanogenesis is sensitive to both high and low pHs and occurs between pH 6.5 and pH 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anaerobic Digester: How It Works [Process] {{!}} GreenTheFuture.com|url = http://greenthefuture.com/DIGESTER_HOWITWORKS_PROCESS.html|website = greenthefuture.com|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining, indigestible material the microbes cannot use and any dead bacterial remains constitute the digestate.

===Configuration===
Anaerobic digesters can be designed and engineered to operate using a number of different configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, [[Mesophilic digester|mesophilic]] vs. [[Thermophilic digester|thermophilic]] temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Comparative Evaluation of Batch and Continuous Anaerobic Digesters in Biogas Production from Municipal Solid Waste using Mathematical Models|url = http://www.cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/article/view/1160|journal = Agricultural Engineering International: CIGR Journal|date = 2009-01-16|issn = 1682-1130|language = en|first = Igoni Hilkia|last = A|first2 = M.

====Batch or continuous====
Anaerobic digestion can be performed as a batch process or a continuous process. In a batch system, biomass is added to the reactor at the start of the process. The reactor is then sealed for the duration of the process. In its simplest form batch processing needs [[inoculation]] with already processed material to start the anaerobic digestion. In a typical scenario, biogas production will be formed with a [[normal distribution]] pattern over time. Operators can use this fact to determine when they believe the process of digestion of the organic matter has completed. There can be severe odour issues if a batch reactor is opened and emptied before the process is well completed. A more advanced type of batch approach has limited the odour issues by integrating anaerobic digestion with [[in-vessel composting]]. In this approach inoculation takes place through the use of recirculated degasified percolate. After anaerobic digestion has completed, the biomass is kept in the reactor which is then used for [[in-vessel composting]] before it is opened&lt;ref&gt;[http://aikantechnology.com/how-it-works/batch-processing.html aikantechnology.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206123235/http://www.aikantechnology.com/how-it-works/batch-processing.html |date=6 February 2012 }} Retrieved 10. Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As the batch digestion is simple and requires less equipment and lower levels of design work, it is typically a cheaper form of digestion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/research/renewable/biomass/anaerobic_digestion/index.html Anaerobic digestion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613112417/http://www.energy.ca.gov/research/renewable/biomass/anaerobic_digestion/index.html |date=13 June 2009 }}, energy.ca.gov. Retrieved 18.06.09.&lt;/ref&gt; Using more than one batch reactor at a plant can ensure constant production of biogas.

In continuous digestion processes, organic matter is constantly added (continuous complete mixed) or added in stages to the reactor (continuous plug flow; first in – first out). Here, the end products are constantly or periodically removed, resulting in constant production of biogas. A single or multiple digesters in sequence may be used. Examples of this form of anaerobic digestion include [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]]s, [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket]]s, [[expanded granular sludge bed]]s, and [[internal circulation reactor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paques.nl/?pid=42&amp;parentid=41 BIOPAQ IC], paques.nl.

====Temperature====
The two conventional operational temperature levels for anaerobic digesters determine the species of methanogens in the digesters:&lt;ref&gt;Song, Y.C., Kwon, S.J., Woo, J.H. (2004) Mesophilic and thermophilic temperature co-phase anaerobic digestion compared with single-stage mesophilic- and thermophilic digestion of sewage sludge, Water Res. 2004 Apr;38(7):1653–62&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mesophilic digester|''Mesophilic'' digestion]] takes place optimally around 30 to 38&amp;nbsp;°C, or at ambient temperatures between 20 and 45&amp;nbsp;°C, where mesophiles are the primary microorganism present.
* [[Thermophilic digester|''Thermophilic'' digestion]] takes place optimally around 49 to 57&amp;nbsp;°C, or at elevated temperatures up to 70&amp;nbsp;°C, where thermophiles are the primary microorganisms present.

A limit case has been reached in [[Bolivia]], with anaerobic digestion in temperature working conditions of less than 10&amp;nbsp;°C. The anaerobic process is very slow, taking more than three times the normal mesophilic time process.&lt;ref name="lrrd.org"/&gt; In experimental work at [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], a 1,000 litre digester using [[psychrophiles]] harvested from "mud from a frozen lake in Alaska" has produced 200–300&amp;nbsp;litres of methane per day, about 20 to 30% of the output from digesters in warmer climates.&lt;ref name="NewSc2785p14"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesophilic species outnumber thermophiles, and they are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles. Mesophilic systems are, therefore, considered to be more stable than thermophilic digestion systems. In contrast, while thermophilic digestion systems are considered less stable, their energy input is higher, with more biogas being removed from the organic matter in an equal amount of time. The increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates, and thus faster gas yields. Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater pathogen reduction of the digestate. In countries where legislation, such as the [[Animal By-Products Regulations]] in the European Union, requires digestate to meet certain levels of pathogen reduction there may be a benefit to using thermophilic temperatures instead of mesophilic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/animalbyproducts/index_en.htm Animal by-products introduction], ec.europa.eu. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional pre-treatment can be used to reduce the necessary retention time to produce biogas. For example, certain processes shred the substrates to increase the surface area or use a thermal pretreatment stage (such as pasteurisation) to significantly enhance the biogas output. The pasteurisation process can also be used to reduce the pathogenic concentration in the digesate leaving the anaerobic digester. Pasteurisation may be achieved by heat treatment combined with [[maceration (sewage)|maceration]] of the solids.

====Solids content====
In a typical scenario, three different operational parameters are associated with the solids content of the feedstock to the digesters:
* High solids (dry—stackable substrate)
* High solids (wet—pumpable substrate)
* Low solids (wet—pumpable substrate)

High solids (dry) digesters are designed to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters are designed to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed into the top of the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a [[total suspended solids]] (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.&lt;ref name="eunomia.co.uk"&gt;[http://eunomia.co.uk/NI%20AD%20final%20report.pdf Feasibility study concerning anaerobic digestion in Northern Ireland], eunomia.co.uk, Retrieved 19.08.07. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128093059/http://eunomia.co.uk/NI%20AD%20final%20report.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maximum"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Jewell | first1 = W.| first2 = R.| first3 = B. | title = Methane fermentation of energy crops: Maximum conversion kinetics and in situ biogas purification | journal = Biomass and Bioenergy | volume = 5| issue = 3–4 | pages = 261–278 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1016/0961-9534(93)90076-G| last2 = Cummings| last3 = Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High solids (wet) digesters process a thick slurry that requires more energy input to move and process the feedstock. The thickness of the material may also lead to associated problems with abrasion. High solids digesters will typically have a lower land requirement due to the lower volumes associated with the moisture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} High solids digesters also require correction of conventional performance calculations (e.g. gas production, retention time, kinetics, etc.) originally based on very dilute sewage digestion concepts, since larger fractions of the feedstock mass are potentially convertible to biogas.&lt;ref name="Methods"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = B.| first2 = R.| first3 = T.| first4 = W. | title = Methods for kinetic analysis of methane fermentation in high solids biomass digesters| last1 = Richards | journal = Biomass and Bioenergy | volume = 1| issue = 2 | pages =  65–73| year = 1991 | doi = 10.1016/0961-9534(91)90028-B| last2 = Cummings| last3 = White| last4 = Jewell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low solids (wet) digesters can transport material through the system using standard pumps that require significantly lower energy input. Low solids digesters require a larger amount of land than high solids due to the increased volumes associated with the increased liquid-to-feedstock ratio of the digesters. There are benefits associated with operation in a liquid environment, as it enables more thorough circulation of materials and contact between the bacteria and their food. This enables the bacteria to more readily access the substances on which they are feeding, and increases the rate of gas production.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====Complexity====
Digestion systems can be configured with different levels of complexity.&lt;ref name="eunomia.co.uk" /&gt; In a '''single-stage digestion system''' (one-stage), all of the biological reactions occur within a single, sealed reactor or holding tank. Using a single stage reduces construction costs, but results in less control of the reactions occurring within the system. Acidogenic bacteria, through the production of acids, reduce the pH of the tank. Methanogenic bacteria, as outlined earlier, operate in a strictly defined pH range.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZdRJfMKORwC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=acidogens+reduce+ph&amp;source=web&amp;ots=EJkTnAMkfq&amp;sig=qlyQVlqbt_N_1m1c20NduxAEK90#PPP1,M1 Biomethanation in advances in biochemical engineering and biotechnology], books.google.com. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the biological reactions of the different species in a single-stage reactor can be in direct competition with each other. Another one-stage reaction system is an [[anaerobic lagoon]]. These lagoons are pond-like, earthen basins used for the treatment and long-term storage of manures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/explore/envqual/eq0387.htm Anaerobic Lagoons for Storage/Treatment of Livestock Manure], missouri.edu. Retrieved 8.11.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Here the anaerobic reactions are contained within the natural anaerobic sludge contained in the pool.

In a '''two-stage digestion system''' (multistage), different digestion vessels are optimised to bring maximum control over the bacterial communities living within the digesters. Acidogenic bacteria produce organic acids and more quickly grow and reproduce than methanogenic bacteria. Methanogenic bacteria require stable pH and temperature to optimise their performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71002223/ABSTRACT Abstract: Methanogenic population dynamics during start-up of anaerobic digesters treating municipal solid waste and biosolids], interscience.wiley.com. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under typical circumstances, hydrolysis, acetogenesis, and acidogenesis occur within the first reaction vessel. The organic material is then heated to the required operational temperature (either mesophilic or thermophilic) prior to being pumped into a methanogenic reactor. The initial hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks prior to the methanogenic reactor can provide a buffer to the rate at which feedstock is added. Some European countries require a degree of elevated heat treatment to kill harmful bacteria in the input waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.archive.mlodeuu.com/ahvla-en/animalh/disease-control/by-prods Animal By-Products Regulations], defra.gov.uk.

Notably, it is not possible to completely isolate the different reaction phases, and often some biogas is produced in the hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks.

==== Residence time ====
The residence time in a digester varies with the amount and type of feed material, and with the configuration of the digestion system. In a typical two-stage mesophilic digestion, residence time varies between 15 and 40&amp;nbsp;days,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gastechnology.org/webroot/app/xn/xd.aspx?it=enweb&amp;xd=4reportspubs%5C4_8focus%5Chimetfocus.xml HIMET—A Two-Stage Anaerobic Digestion Process for Converting Waste to Energy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030224122741/http://gastechnology.org/webroot/app/xn/xd.aspx?it=enweb&amp;xd=4reportspubs%5C4_8focus%5Chimetfocus.xml |date=24 February 2003 }}, gastechnology.org. Retrieved 19.08.07.&lt;/ref&gt; while for a single-stage thermophilic digestion, residence times is normally faster and takes around 14&amp;nbsp;days. The plug-flow nature of some of these systems will mean the full degradation of the material may not have been realised in this timescale. In this event, digestate exiting the system will be darker in colour and will typically have more odour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the case of an [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion]] (UASB), hydraulic residence times can be as short as 1 hour to 1 day, and solid retention times can be up to 90 days. In this manner, a UASB system is able to separate solids and hydraulic retention times with the use of a sludge blanket.&lt;ref&gt;Finstein, M. S. (2006) [http://www.oaktech-environmental.com/documents/ProceedingsSWANA2006Nashville.pdf ArrowBio process integrates preprocessing and advanced anaerobic digestion to recover recyclables and generate electricity], oaktech-environmental.com. Retrieved 19.08.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous digesters have mechanical or hydraulic devices, depending on the level of solids in the material, to mix the contents, enabling the bacteria and the food to be in contact. They also allow excess material to be continuously extracted to maintain a reasonably constant volume within the digestion tanks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Inhibition===
The anaerobic digestion process can be inhibited by several compounds, affecting one or more of the bacterial groups responsible for the different organic matter degradation steps. The degree of the inhibition depends, among other factors, on the concentration of the inhibitor in the digester. Potential inhibitors are ammonia, sulfide, light metal ions (Na, K, Mg, Ca, Al), heavy metals, some organics (chlorophenols, halogenated aliphatics, N-substituted aromatics, long chain fatty acids), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2007.01.057 | pmid=17399981 | volume=99 | issue=10 | title=Inhibition of anaerobic digestion process: A review | year=2008 | journal=Bioresource Technology | pages=4044–4064 | last1 = Chen | first1 = Ye | last2 = Cheng | first2 = Jay J. | last3 = Creamer | first3 = Kurt S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important initial issue when considering the application of anaerobic digestion systems is the feedstock to the process. Almost any organic material can be processed with anaerobic digestion;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=31, Alfagy.com, retrieved 16.08.09] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110727/http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=31, |date=7 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, if biogas production is the aim, the level of putrescibility is the key factor in its successful application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisbiorefine.org/proc/anaerobic.pdf Anaerobic digestion feedstock classification] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034038/http://www.wisbiorefine.org/proc/anaerobic.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}, wisbiorefine.org. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; The more putrescible (digestible) the material, the higher the gas yields possible from the system.

Feedstocks can include biodegradable waste materials, such as waste paper, grass clippings, leftover food, sewage, and animal waste.&lt;ref name=nnfcc /&gt; [[Wood]]y wastes are the exception, because they are largely unaffected by digestion, as most anaerobes are unable to degrade [[lignin]]. Xylophalgeous anaerobes (lignin consumers) or using high temperature pretreatment, such as pyrolysis, can be used to break lignin down. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with specially grown [[energy crop]]s, such as [[silage]], for dedicated biogas production. In Germany and continental Europe, these facilities are referred to as "biogas" plants. A codigestion or cofermentation plant is typically an agricultural anaerobic digester that accepts two or more input materials for simultaneous digestion.&lt;ref&gt;Lemmer, A. &amp; Oeschsner, H.

The length of time required for anaerobic digestion depends on the chemical complexity of the material. Material rich in easily digestible sugars breaks down quickly, whereas intact lignocellulosic material rich in cellulose and hemicellulose polymers can take much longer to break down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anaerobic-digestion.com/old-rope-anaerobic-digestion-article], waste-management-world.com.

Anaerobic digesters were originally designed for operation using sewage sludge and manures. Sewage and manure are not, however, the material with the most potential for anaerobic digestion, as the biodegradable material has already had much of the energy content taken out by the animals that produced it. Therefore, many digesters operate with codigestion of two or more types of feedstock. For example, in a farm-based digester that uses dairy manure as the primary feedstock, the gas production may be significantly increased by adding a second feedstock, e.g., grass and corn (typical on-farm feedstock), or various organic byproducts, such as slaughterhouse waste, fats, oils and grease from restaurants, organic household waste, etc. (typical off-site feedstock).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Anaerobic Digestion Initiative Advisory Committee (ADIAC)|title=Feedstock|url=http://www.bcfarmbiogas.ca/Feedstockenergy/feedstock |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213185207/http://bcfarmbiogas.ca/Feedstockenergy/feedstock |archivedate=13 December 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moisture content===
A second consideration related to the feedstock is moisture content. Drier, stackable substrates, such as food and yard waste, are suitable for digestion in tunnel-like chambers. Tunnel-style systems typically have near-zero wastewater discharge, as well, so this style of system has advantages where the discharge of digester liquids are a liability. The wetter the material, the more suitable it will be to handling with standard pumps instead of energy-intensive concrete pumps and physical means of movement. Also, the wetter the material, the more volume and area it takes up relative to the levels of gas produced. The moisture content of the target feedstock will also affect what type of system is applied to its treatment. To use a high-solids anaerobic digester for dilute feedstocks, bulking agents, such as compost, should be applied to increase the solids content of the input material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?doi=XfhO-iP3em4C&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=high+solids+anaerobic+digestion+bulking&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fEDEUaGKK4&amp;sig=B9CbvsX37xfMDLF4ILVhMKp2D-U#PPP1,M1 Management of Urban Biodegradable Waste], books.google.com. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Another key consideration is the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the input material. This ratio is the balance of food a microbe requires to grow; the optimal C:N ratio is 20–30:1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bvsde.ops-oms.org/bvsaar/cdlodos/pdf/anaerobiccodigestion495.pdf Anaerobic co-digestion of sewage sludge and rice straw], bvsde.ops-oms.org. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Excess N can lead to ammonia inhibition of digestion.&lt;ref name="Low" /&gt;

===Contamination===
The level of contamination of the feedstock material is a key consideration. If the feedstock to the digesters has significant levels of physical contaminants, such as plastic, glass, or metals, then processing to remove the contaminants will be required for the material to be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seas.ucla.edu/stenstro/r/r10 Anaerobic digestion of classified municipal solid wastes], seas.ucla.edu. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; If it is not removed, then the digesters can be blocked and will not function efficiently. It is with this understanding that mechanical biological treatment plants are designed. The higher the level of pretreatment a feedstock requires, the more processing machinery will be required, and, hence, the project will have higher capital costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]].

After sorting or screening to remove any physical contaminants from the feedstock, the material is often shredded, minced, and mechanically or hydraulically pulped to increase the surface area available to microbes in the digesters and, hence, increase the speed of digestion. The maceration of solids can be achieved by using a [[chopper pump]] to transfer the feedstock material into the airtight digester, where anaerobic treatment takes place.

===Substrate composition===
Substrate composition is a major factor in determining the methane yield and methane production rates from the digestion of biomass. Techniques to determine the compositional characteristics of the feedstock are available, while parameters such as solids, elemental, and organic analyses are important for digester design and operation.&lt;ref&gt;Jerger, D. &amp; Tsao, G. (2006) Feed composition in Anaerobic digestion of biomass, p65&lt;/ref&gt; Methane yield can be estimated from the elemental composition of substrate along with an estimate of its degradability (the fraction of the substrate that is converted to biogas in a reactor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Biotechnology|last=Rittmann 1, McCarty 2|first=B 1, P 2|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2001|isbn=978-0072345537|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to predict biogas composition (the relative fractions of methane and carbon dioxide) it is necessary to estimate [[carbon dioxide]] [[Partition coefficient|partitioning]] between the aqueous and gas phases, which requires additional information (reactor temperature, [[pH]], and substrate composition) and a chemical speciation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=D.

Using anaerobic digestion technologies can help to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in a number of key ways:
* Replacement of fossil fuels
* Reducing or eliminating the energy footprint of waste treatment plants
* Reducing methane emission from landfills
* Displacing industrially produced chemical fertilizers
* Reducing [[automobile|vehicle]] movements
* Reducing [[electricity grid|electrical grid]] transportation losses
* Reducing usage of [[LP Gas]] for [[cooking]]

If the putrescible waste processed in anaerobic digesters were disposed of in a landfill, it would break down naturally and often anaerobically. In this case, the gas will eventually escape into the atmosphere. As methane is about 20 times more potent as a [[greenhouse gas]] than carbon dioxide, this has significant negative environmental effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/sepp/2005/02/01/global_warming_methane_could_be_far_worse_than_carbon_dioxide.htm Global warming methane could be far more potent than carbon dioxide] newmediaexplorer.org. Retrieved 17.08.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries that collect household waste, the use of local anaerobic digestion facilities can help to reduce the amount of waste that requires transportation to centralized landfill sites or incineration facilities. This reduced burden on transportation reduces carbon emissions from the collection vehicles. If localized anaerobic digestion facilities are embedded within an electrical distribution network, they can help reduce the electrical losses associated with transporting electricity over a national grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/04-05/demand_side_management/framework5.htm Renewable Energy Framework], esru.strath.ac.uk.

Methane and power produced in anaerobic digestion facilities can be used to replace energy derived from fossil fuels, and hence reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, because the carbon in biodegradable material is part of a [[carbon cycle]]. The carbon released into the atmosphere from the combustion of biogas has been removed by plants for them to grow in the recent past, usually within the last decade, but more typically within the last growing season. If the plants are regrown, taking the carbon out of the atmosphere once more, the system will be carbon neutral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afbini.gov.uk/index/services/specialist-advice/renewable-energy/re-anaerobic-digestion-intro/re-anaerobic-digestion-benefits.htm Benefits of Anaerobic Digestion], afbini.gov.uk.

Biogas from [[sewage sludge treatment]] is sometimes used to run a [[gas engine]] to produce electrical power, some or all of which can be used to run the sewage works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/38-hhv-caterpillar-bio-gas-engine-fitted-to-long-reach-sewage-works.html 38% HHV Caterpillar Bio-gas Engine Fitted to Sewage Works | Claverton Group&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], claverton-energy.com&lt;/ref&gt; Some waste heat from the engine is then used to heat the digester. The waste heat is, in general, enough to heat the digester to the required temperatures. The power potential from sewage works is limited – in the UK, there are about 80&amp;nbsp;MW total of such generation, with the potential to increase to 150&amp;nbsp;MW, which is insignificant compared to the average power demand in the UK of about 35,000&amp;nbsp;MW. The scope for biogas generation from nonsewage waste biological matter – energy crops, food waste, abattoir waste, etc. - is much higher, estimated to be capable of about 3,000&amp;nbsp;MW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Farm biogas plants using animal waste and energy crops are expected to contribute to reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and strengthen the grid, while providing UK farmers with additional revenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=31 Alfagy.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110257/http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=31 |date=7 July 2011 }}, "Be Green – Make Gas"&lt;/ref&gt;

In Oakland, California at the [[East Bay Municipal Utility District]]’s main wastewater treatment plant (EBMUD), [[food waste]] is currently codigested with primary and secondary municipal wastewater solids and other high-strength wastes.

Anaerobic digestion of food waste pulp from the EBMUD food waste process provides a higher normalized energy benefit, compared to municipal wastewater solids: 730 to 1,300 kWh per dry ton of food waste applied compared to 560 to 940 kWh per dry ton of municipal wastewater solids applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=East Bay Municipal Utility District|title=Anaerobic Digestion of Food Waste|year=2008|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/region9/organics/ad/EBMUDFinalReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organics: Anaerobic Digestion|url=http://www.epa.gov/region9/organics/ad/index.html|work=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grid injection===
Biogas grid-injection is the injection of biogas into the [[natural gas grid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgrid.com/corporate/About+Us/climate/press/020209.htm Half Britain’s homes could be heated by renewable gas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208061528/http://www.nationalgrid.com/corporate/About+Us/climate/press/020209.htm |date=8 December 2009 }}, nationalgrid.com&lt;/ref&gt; The raw biogas has to be previously upgraded to biomethane. This upgrading implies the removal of contaminants such as hydrogen sulphide or siloxanes, as well as the carbon dioxide. Several technologies are available for this purpose, the most widely implemented being [[Pressure swing adsorption|pressure swing adsorption (PSA)]], water or [[Amine gas treating|amine scrubbing]] (absorption processes) and, in recent years, [[Membrane technology|membrane separation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea-biogas.net/files/daten-redaktion/download/publi-task37/upgrading_rz_low_final.pdf Petersson A., Wellinger A.

===Vehicle fuel===
After upgrading with the above-mentioned technologies, the biogas (transformed into biomethane) can be used as vehicle fuel in adapted vehicles. This use is very extensive in Sweden, where over 38,600 gas vehicles exist, and 60% of the vehicle gas is biomethane generated in anaerobic digestion plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngvaeurope.eu/sweden Natural &amp; bioGas Vehicle Association (NVGA).

===Fertiliser and soil conditioner===
The solid, fibrous component of the digested material can be used as a soil conditioner to increase the organic content of soils. Digester liquor can be used as a fertiliser to supply vital nutrients to soils instead of chemical fertilisers that require large amounts of energy to produce and transport. The use of manufactured fertilisers is, therefore, more carbon-intensive than the use of anaerobic digester liquor fertiliser. In countries such as [[Spain]], where many soils are organically depleted, the markets for the digested solids can be equally as important as the biogas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compostnetwork.info/index.php?id=44 Introduction and Spanish organic waste situation], compostnetwork.info. Retrieved 19.08.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooking gas===
By using a [[bio-digester]], which produces the bacteria required for decomposing, cooking gas is generated. The organic garbage like fallen leaves, kitchen waste, food waste etc. are fed into a crusher unit, where the mixture is conflated with a small amount of water. The mixture is then fed into the bio-digester, where the bacteria decomposes it to produce cooking gas. This gas is piped to kitchen stove. A 2 cubic meter bio-digester can produce 2 cubic meter of cooking gas. This is equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;kg of LPG. The notable advantage of using a bio-digester is the sludge which is a rich organic manure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/article3698431.ece|title= Satisfaction of reducing your carbon footprint|journal= The Hindu| accessdate=2012-07-31|date= 2012-07-28|last1= Vijay|first1= Hema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digestate===
{{Main|digestate}}

Digestate is the solid remnants of the original input material to the digesters that the microbes cannot use. It also consists of the mineralised remains of the dead bacteria from within the digesters. Digestate can come in three forms: fibrous, liquor, or a sludge-based combination of the two fractions. In two-stage systems, different forms of digestate come from different digestion tanks. In single-stage digestion systems, the two fractions will be combined and, if desired, separated by further processing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waste.nl/page/248 Fact sheet on anaerobic digestion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055626/http://www.waste.nl/page/248 |date=28 September 2007 }}, waste.nl.

The second byproduct (acidogenic digestate) is a stable, organic material consisting largely of lignin and cellulose, but also of a variety of mineral components in a matrix of dead bacterial cells; some plastic may be present. The material resembles domestic compost and can be used as such or to make low-grade building products, such as fibreboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexmarshall.me.uk/index_files/documents/ResponsetoConsultationonthesourcesegregationrequirementinParagraph7AofSchedule3totheWasteMan.pdf Oaktech Consultation Response to UK Source Segregation Requirement], alexmarshall.me.uk.

Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;
The solid digestate can also be used as feedstock for ethanol production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/bit.22627 | pmid=19998279 | title=A sustainable pathway of cellulosic ethanol production integrating anaerobic digestion with biorefining | year=2010 | journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering | volume=105 | issue=6 | pages=1031–9 | last1 = Yue | first1 = Zhengbo | last2 = Teater | first2 = Charles | last3 = Liu | first3 = Yan | last4 = MacLellan | first4 = James | last5 = Liao | first5 = Wei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third byproduct is a liquid (methanogenic digestate) rich in nutrients, which can be used as a fertiliser, depending on the quality of the material being digested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalwarming101.com/content/view/595/88888958/ Biomass and biogas], globalwarming101.com. Retrieved 24.10.07. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605194618/http://www.globalwarming101.com/content/view/595/88888958/ |date=5 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) should be chemically assessed. This will depend upon the quality of the original feedstock. In the case of most clean and source-separated biodegradable waste streams, the levels of PTEs will be low. In the case of wastes originating from industry, the levels of PTEs may be higher and will need to be taken into consideration when determining a suitable end use for the material.

Digestate typically contains elements, such as lignin, that cannot be broken down by the anaerobic microorganisms. Also, the digestate may contain ammonia that is phytotoxic, and may hamper the growth of plants if it is used as a soil-improving material. For these two reasons, a maturation or composting stage may be employed after digestion. Lignin and other materials are available for degradation by aerobic microorganisms, such as fungi, helping reduce the overall volume of the material for transport. During this maturation, the ammonia will be oxidized into nitrates, improving the fertility of the material and making it more suitable as a soil improver. Large composting stages are typically used by dry anaerobic digestion technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ows.be/pub/Vitoria_InfoEnviro.mei07.pdf Vitoria Plant Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128093059/http://www.ows.be/pub/Vitoria_InfoEnviro.mei07.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}, ows.be.

===Wastewater===
The final output from anaerobic digestion systems is water, which originates both from the moisture content of the original waste that was treated and water produced during the microbial reactions in the digestion systems. This water may be released from the dewatering of the digestate or may be implicitly separate from the digestate.

The wastewater exiting the anaerobic digestion facility will typically have elevated levels of [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) and [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD). These measures of the reactivity of the effluent indicate an ability to pollute. Some of this material is termed 'hard COD', meaning it cannot be accessed by the anaerobic bacteria for conversion into biogas. If this effluent were put directly into watercourses, it would negatively affect them by causing [[eutrophication]]. As such, further treatment of the wastewater is often required. This treatment will typically be an oxidation stage wherein air is passed through the water in a sequencing batch reactors or [[reverse osmosis]] unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dosta|first=Joan|last2=Galí |first2=Alexandre |last3=Macé |first3=Sandra |last4=Mata‐Álvarez |first4=Joan|title=Modelling a sequencing batch reactor to treat the supernatant from anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste|journal=Journal of Chemical Technology &amp; Biotechnology|date=February 2007|volume=82|issue=2|pages=158–64|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jws/jctb/2007/00000082/00000002/art00006?crawler=true|accessdate=16 September 2013|doi=10.1002/jctb.1645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.co.uk/clarke_waste/water_treatment.htm Clarke Energy Reverse Osmosis Unit], clarke-energy.co.uk.

[[Feed-in tariffs in Germany]] were enacted in 1991, also known as FIT, providing long-term contracts compensating investments in renewable energy generation. Consequently, between 1991 and 1998 the number of anaerobic digester plants in Germany grew from 20 to 517. In the late 1990s, energy prices in Germany varied and investors became unsure of the market’s potential. The German government responded by amending FIT four times between 2000 and 2011, increasing tariffs and improving the profitability of anaerobic digestion, and resulting in reliable returns for biogas production and continued high adoption rates across the country.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Auxiliary feedwater''' is a backup [[water]] supply system found in [[pressurized water reactor]] [[nuclear power plant]]s (PWRs). This system, sometimes known as Emergency feedwater, can be used for shutdown the reactor, if normal feedwater to the [[steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generators]] fails to work. It works by pumping water to the steam generators from reserve tanks or a larger body of water (e.g. lake, river, or ocean) to remove [[decay heat]] from the [[nuclear reactor|reactor]]. Often, but not always, the PWRs are equipped with ''motor driven'' aux feedwater systems (MDAFWs) and as a diverse mean as well ''turbine driven'' aux feedwater systems (TDAFWs), that take their drive not from electricity, but from the steam in the normal secondary side steam circuit of the plant. In difference to the [[ECCS]]-system for [[Loss-of-coolant accident|LOCA]]s, the auxiliary feedwater system doesn't inject directly into the reactor core, it cools in an indirect manner by cooling the primary circuit with the reactor via the steam generators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11140">A '''battery management system''' ('''BMS''') is any electronic system that manages a [[rechargeable battery]] ([[Electrochemical cell|cell]] or [[battery pack]]), such as by protecting the battery from operating outside its [[safe operating area]], monitoring its state, calculating secondary data, reporting that data, controlling its environment, authenticating it and / or [[Battery balancing|balancing]] it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGdklAEACAAJ|title=Battery Power Management for Portable Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[battery pack]] built together with a battery management system with an external communication [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] is a [[smart battery pack]]. A smart battery pack must be charged by a [[smart battery charger]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Functions ==
[[File:Akkuschutzschaltung mit Balancer 4S.jpg|thumb|Safety circuit for 4 cell LiFePO4 batteries with balancer]]

=== Monitor ===

A BMS may monitor the state of the battery as represented by various items, such as:

* [[Voltage]]: total voltage, voltages of individual cells, minimum and maximum cell voltage or voltage of periodic taps
* [[Temperature]]: average temperature, coolant intake temperature, coolant output temperature, or temperatures of individual cells
* [[State of charge]] (SOC) or [[depth of discharge]] (DOD), to indicate the charge level of the battery
* [[State of health]] (SOH), a variously-defined measurement of the remaining capacity of the battery as % of the original capacity
* [[State of power]] (SOP), the amount of power available for a defined time interval given the current power usage, temperature and other conditions
* Coolant flow: for air or fluid cooled batteries
* [[Electric current|Current]]: current in or out of the battery

=== Electric Vehicle Systems: Energy Recovery ===

* The BMS will also control the recharging of the battery by redirecting the recovered energy (i.e.- from [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]]) back into the battery pack (typically composed of a few batteries, each composed of a few cells).

=== Computation ===

Additionally, a BMS may calculate values based on the above items, such as:

* Maximum charge current as a [[charge current limit]] (CCL)
* Maximum discharge current as a [[discharge current limit]] (DCL)
* Energy [kWh] delivered since last charge or charge cycle
* Internal impedance of a cell (to determine open circuit voltage)
* Charge [Ah] delivered or stored (sometimes this feature is called Coulomb counter)
* Total energy delivered since first use
* Total operating time since first use
* Total number of cycles

=== Communication ===

The central controller of a BMS communicates internally with its cell level hardware, or externally with high level hardware such as laptops or [[User interface|HMI]].

High level external communication are simple and use several methods:

* Different types of [[serial communications]]. 
* [[CAN bus]] communications, commonly used in automotive environments.
* [http://www.yamar.com/sig60.php DC-BUS] - Serial communication over power-line
* Different types of [[Wireless communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tu.no/artikler/kapper-ledninger-for-a-gi-lengre-rekkevidde-til-elbiler/364661 |title=Kapper ledninger for å gi lengre rekkevidde til elbiler|work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low voltage centralized BMSs mostly do not have any internal communications.  They measure cell voltage by resistance divide.

Distributed or modular  BMSs must use some low level internal cell-controller (Modular architecture) or controller-controller (Distributed architecture) communication.  These types of communications are difficult, especially for high voltage systems.  The problem is voltage shift between cells.  The first cell ground signal may be hundreds of volts higher than the other cell ground signal.  Apart from software protocols, there are two known ways of hardware communication for voltage shifting systems, [[Opto-isolator|Optical-isolator]] and [[Wireless communications|wireless communication]].  Another restriction for internal communications is the maximum number of cells.  For modular architecture most hardware is limited to maximum 255 nodes.  For high voltage systems the seeking time of all cells is another restriction, limiting minimum bus speeds and losing some hardware options.  Cost of modular systems is important, because it may be comparable to the cell price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lianinno.com/battery-management-systems/|title=Different Battery Management System Topology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combination of hardware and software restrictions results to be a few options for internal communication:
* Isolated serial communications
* wireless serial communications

=== Protection ===

A BMS may protect its battery by preventing it from operating outside its [[safe operating area]], such as:

* Over-current (may be different in charging and discharging modes)
* Over-voltage (during charging)
* Under-voltage (during discharging), especially important for [[lead–acid]] and [[Li-ion]] cells
* Over-temperature
* Under-temperature
* Over-pressure ([[NiMH]] batteries)
* Ground fault or leakage current detection (system monitoring that the high voltage battery is electrically disconnected from any conductive object touchable to use like vehicle body)

The BMS may prevent operation outside the battery's safe operating area by:

* Including an internal [[switch]] (such as a [[relay]] or [[solid state device]]) which is opened if the battery is operated outside its safe operating area
* Requesting the devices to which the battery is connected to reduce or even terminate using the battery.
* Actively controlling the environment, such as through heaters, fans, air conditioning or liquid cooling[[File:Bms MainController.png|thumb|BMS Main Controller|225x225px]]

=== Battery connection to load circuit ===
A BMS may also feature a precharge system allowing a safe way to connect the battery to different loads and eliminating the excessive inrush currents to load capacitors.

The connection to loads is normally controlled through electromagnetic relays called contactors. The precharge circuit can be either power resistors connected in series with the loads until the capacitors are charged. Alternatively, a switched mode power supply connected in parallel to loads can be used to charge the voltage of the load circuit up to a level close enough to battery voltage in order to allow closing the contactors between battery and load circuit. A BMS may have a circuit that can check whether a relay is already closed before precharging (due to welding for example) to prevent inrush currents to occur.

=== Optimization ===
[[File:InnoTeg.png|thumb|Distributed Battery Management system|221x221px]]In order to maximize the battery's capacity, and to prevent localized under-charging or over-charging, the BMS may actively ensure that all the cells that compose the battery are kept at the same voltage or State of Charge, through balancing. The BMS can balance the cells by:

* Wasting [[energy]] from the most charged cells by connecting them to a [[Electrical load|load]] (such as through passive [[Battery regulator|regulators]])
* Shuffling energy from the most charged cells to the least charged cells ([[Battery balancer|balancers]])
* Reducing the charging current to a sufficiently low level that will not damage fully charged cells, while less charged cells may continue to charge (does not apply to Lithium chemistry cells)
* Modular charging &lt;ref&gt;http://www.metricmind.com/audi/14-battery.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topologies ==
[[File:InnoCab.png|thumb|Cable Data transfer module]]
[[File:Innoles.png|thumb|BMS Wireless Communication]]
BMS technology varies in complexity and performance:
*Simple passive regulators achieve balancing across batteries or cells by bypassing charging current when the cell's voltage reaches a certain level. The cell voltage is a poor indicator of the cell's SOC (and for certain Lithium chemistries such as [[LiFePO4]] it is no indicator at all), thus, making cell voltages equal using passive regulators does not balance SOC, which is the goal of a BMS. Therefore, such devices, while certainly beneficial, have severe limitations in their effectiveness.
* Active regulators intelligently turning on and off a load when appropriate, again to achieve balancing. If only the cell voltage is used as a parameter to enable the active regulators, the same constraints noted above for passive regulators apply.
* A complete BMS also reports the state of the battery to a display, and protects the battery.
BMS topologies fall in 3 categories:
* Centralized: a single controller is connected to the battery cells through a multitude of wires
* Distributed: a BMS board is installed at each cell, with just a single communication cable between the battery and a controller
* Modular: a few controllers, each handing a certain number of cells, with communication between the controllers

Centralized BMSs are most economical, least expandable, and are plagued by a multitude of wires.
Distributed BMSs are the most expensive, simplest to install, and offer the cleanest assembly.
Modular BMSs offer a compromise of the features and problems of the other two topologies.

The requirements for a BMS in mobile applications (such as electric vehicles) and stationary applications (like stand-by UPSs in a [[server room]]) are quite different, especially from the space and weight constraint requirements, so the hardware and software implementations must be tailored to the specific use. In the case of electric or hybrid vehicles, the BMS is only a subsystem and cannot work as a standalone device. It must communicate with at least a charger (or charging infrastructure), a load, thermal management and emergency shutdown subsystems. Therefore, in a good vehicle design the BMS is tightly integrated with those subsystems. Some small mobile applications (such as medical equipment carts, motorized wheelchairs, scooters, and fork lifts) often have external charging hardware, however the on-board BMS must still have tight design integration with the external charger.

Various [[Battery balancing]] methods are in use, some of them based on [[state of charge]] theory.

The '''Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers''' (CAPP), with its head office in Calgary, Alberta, is a lobby group that represents the upstream Canadian oil and natural gas industry.&lt;ref name=IOP2009&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|author1=Alex D Charpentier|author2=Joule A Bergerson|author3=Heather L MacLean|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/4/1/014005|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/4/1/014005/pdf/1748-9326_4_1_014005.pdf|format=PDF|title=Understanding the Canadian oil sands industry's greenhouse gas emissions|publisher=IOP Publishing Ltd|journal=Environmental Research Letters}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAPP's members produce "90% of Canada’s natural gas and crude oil"&lt;ref name=dialogues14apr2011 /&gt; and "are an important part of a national industry with revenues of about $100 billion-a-year (CAPP 2011)."&lt;ref name=dialogues14apr2011 /&gt;

==History==
CAPP origins can be traced back to the Alberta Oil Operators’ Association, which was founded in 1927, after the discovery of the Turner Valley Oil Field. In 1947, the Alberta Petroleum Association changed its name to the Western Canadian Petroleum Association, and In 1952, the Western Canada Petroleum Association amalgamated with the Saskatchewan Operators’ Association and adopted the name Canadian Petroleum Association.

At a meeting on December 9, 1952, the CPA drafted a new constitution which outlined the objectives of the organization as follows:
* to establish better understanding between the petroleum and natural gas industry and the public 
* to encourage cooperation between the petroleum and natural gas industry and federal, provincial and local governments, and other authoritative bodies 
* to provide a forum for the discussion of matters affecting the welfare of its members 
* to foster better understanding between the Association and purposes

On June 10, 1958 the CPA opened an office in [[Ottawa]] and became "one (of) the oldest, largest and most influential lobby groups in Canada."&lt;ref name=CAPPhistory /&gt; It provided the federal government with information pertaining to the oil industry while keeping the CPA informed about political trends, government regulations and statistics. By 1965 the CPA had a membership of more than 200 members representing roughly 97 percent of all oil and gas production in Canada. In 1981, two years after the first commercial discovery at [[Hibernia (oil field)|Hibernia]] off the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], the CPA opened an office in [[St. John’s, Newfoundland|St. John’s]] in cooperation with the Eastcoast Petroleum Operators’ Association.

In 1992, when the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) was formed, with the CPA amalgamation with the Independent Petroleum Association of Canada (IPAC) to form the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP),&lt;ref name=CAPPhistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History of CAPP|url=http://www.capp.ca/aboutUs/history/Pages/default.aspx|accessdate=30 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705073542/http://www.capp.ca/aboutUs/history/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=5 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerry Protti was named as founding president.&lt;ref name=CPProtti&gt;{{cite news|title=Gerry Protti, New Alberta Energy Regulator Head, Not The Right Man For The Job: Critics|first=Bob|last=Weber|publisher=Canadian Press|date=5 March 2013|accessdate=25 June 2013|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/05/03/gerry-protti-new-alberta-energy-regulator-head-not-right-for-job_n_3208185.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;First Nations, landowners, ranchers and Alberta Surface Rights among others oppose the appointment of Gerry Protti as chair of the newly created regulatory group [[Alberta Energy Regulator]] which takes over responsibilities of the [[Energy Resources Conservation Board]] (ERCB) and other key institutions in terms of regulatory issues.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CAPP Hall of Fame===
*Michael (Jeffery) A. Jackson (1914–1972), founding  director of the Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, lobbied for the western Canadian oil industry and pushed for pipelines to Central Canada.&lt;ref name=halloffame&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/ra-brown.html|title=CAPP Hall of Fame|publisher=Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy for oil industry==
Canada's estimated total oil reserves including conventional oil were approximately 180 billion barrels (29&amp;nbsp;km³), behind only [[Saudi Arabia]] and Venezuela.  Canada produces approximately 2.7 million barrels (430,000 m³) of crude oil a day, and  6.4 trillion cubic feet (180&amp;nbsp;km³) of natural gas per year.  In 2013, an IPSOS poll showed a majority (75%) of Canadians prioritize local crude before using imported oil from foreign sources, while just over one in ten (14%) ‘disagree’ (4% strongly/11% somewhat) and 11% have no opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IPSOS North America|title=Three-Quarters (75%) of Canadians Believe Oil Refineries Should Prioritize Local Oil Before Importing From Other Countries|url=http://ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=6297|website=IPSOS|date=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAPP has advocated for the industry as GHG emissions rose 14% in 2009 and 2010, by its own admission.  [http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2011/12/16/pol-capp-oil-industry-emissions-report.html]. However, GHG emissions per barrel of oil sands crude produced have dropped by 26% since 1990 as a result of new operating practices and technology.

According to IHS CERA, oil sands crude has similar CO2 emissions to other heavy oils and is 9% more intensive than the U.S. crude supply average on a wells-to-wheels basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oilsands Review|title=Study Says 45% Of U.S. Oil Supply Of Similar GHG Intensity As Oilsands|url=http://navigator.oilsandsreview.com/blog/study-says-45-us-oil-supply-similar-ghg-intensity-oilsands/|website=www.oilsandsreview.com|publisher=Glacier Media|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200516/http://navigator.oilsandsreview.com/blog/study-says-45-us-oil-supply-similar-ghg-intensity-oilsands/|archivedate=2014-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAPP's series of meetings in 2010 in eight cities in Canada and the United States, including Vancouver, Edmonton, Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, Washington D.C., New York and Chicago, with CAPP representatives, oil sands CEOs and 160 key stakeholders, culminated in a report entitled ''Dialogues'' published on 14 April 2011.&lt;ref name=dialogues14apr2011&gt;{{cite report|publisher=Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)|title=Report of the Dialogues on the Oil Sands: Engaging Canadians and Americans|date=14 April 2011|location=Calgary, Alberta|url=http://www.capp.ca/aboutUs/mediaCentre/NewsReleases/Pages/dialogues2011.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701002325/http://www.capp.ca/aboutUs/mediaCentre/NewsReleases/Pages/dialogues2011.aspx|archivedate=1 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy for fracking===
CAPP advocates for the use of the controversial technology [[hydraulic fracturing]]. In 2010 released a series of voluntary Guiding Principles for Hydraulic Fracturing for Canadian natural gas producers to adhere to. The Guiding Principles of Hydraulic Fracturing were followed in 2011 by an agreed set of Six Hydraulic Fracturing Practices for:
1. Fracturing fluid additive disclosure
2. Fracturing fluid additive risk management
3. Baseline groundwater testing
4. Wellbore construction
5. Water sourcing and reuse
6. Fluid handling, transport, disposal

&lt;ref&gt;http://landusekn.ca/resource/guiding-principles-hydraulic-fracturing-capp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms and concerns===
The [[Council of Canadians]] and [[Sierra Club Canada]] take a strong position against [[hydraulic fracturing]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadians.org/water/issues/fracking/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and want it banned in Canada entirely, and have supported specific bans in [[Nova Scotia]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.ca/en/node/4670 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117164923/http://www.sierraclub.ca/en/node/4670 |archivedate=2011-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Brunswick]].

==Advocacy for Crude Oil Exports via Canada's West Coast==
CAPP supports and advocates for exports of Canadian crude oil via Canada's west coast via the [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines|Northern Gateway]] and the KinderMorgan TransMountain Expansion Project. In September 2011, the [[Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada]] (APF Canada) and the [[Canada West Foundation]] established the Canada-Asia Energy Futures Task Force with Kathleen (Kathy) E. Sendall, C.M., FCAE,&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Kathleen Sendall, is director CGG (Paris, France), Director of Enmax Corporation (Calgary, AB); Vice Chair, Alberta Innovates – Energy and Environment Solutions (Calgary, AB); Co-Chair, Canada West/Asia Pacific Foundation Task Force (Calgary, AB)." In 2013 Prime Minister Harper appointed her the Sustainable Development Advisory Council (SDAC) and the Advisory Council for Promoting Women on Boards. She advises "federal and provincial governments in the areas of climate change, carbon capture and storage, environmental legislation, and Arctic foreign policy, and recently chaired the Canadian Council of Academies Assessment Panel on the State of Industrial R&amp;D in Canada. Previously, Ms. Sendall led Petro-Canada's North American Natural Gas Business Unit."[http://www.ai-ees.ca/our-board/kathleen-sendall.aspx Kathleen Sendall Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130628050120/http://www.ai-ees.ca/our-board/kathleen-sendall.aspx |date=2013-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a former Governor and Board Chair of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) and [[Kevin G.

===Criticisms and concerns===
Canadian opponents to the [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines|Northern Gateway]] [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45510746/ns/business-press_releases/t/oil-sands-export-ban-bc-first-nations-unite-declare-province-wide-opposition-crude-oil-pipeline-tanker-expansion/], intended to permit shipping of high-carbon Canadian crude over ecologically sensitive rivers and waters to carbon-uncontrolled countries including India and China, include 61 [[First Nations]] in [[British Columbia]].

==Advocacy for Keystone XL Pipelines expansion==
CAPP supports and advocates for the $7-billion pipeline expansion project by the Canadian-based company TransCanada to build the [[Keystone XL]], that would extend and expand capacity of existing pipelines, that transport crude oil from the [[Athabasca oil sands]] in northern Alberta to [[Tidewater (marketing)|tidewater]] and to refineries in the Gulf, capable of refining the heavy bitumen crude oil.

===Criticisms and concerns===
Nine winners of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], including Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] and the [[Dalai Lama]], were signatories to a letter to pressure U.S. President Barack Obama to reject the $7-billion pipeline expansion project by the Canadian-based company TransCanada to build the Keystone XL.

The position of the Nobel Peace Prize winners, essentially, is that one rich nation selling increasingly heavy high-carbon oil to another sabotages any effort to reach a deal on global carbon controls, and that moves to expand this export (like [[Keystone XL]] or [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines|Northern Gateway]]) cause significant and direct risks to world peace, as climate victim countries become subject to chaotic weather, fighting over scarce water (especially in Southeast Asia and Africa), flooding and rising sea levels.

==Advocacy regarding GHG emissions==
CAPP opposed the [[Kyoto Protocol]], from which [[Stephen Harper]] withdrew Canada in December 2011. CAPP's lobbying efforts included favouring  "made in Canada" approach and advocating for a [[carbon pricing]] program. In 2007 a carbon tax was implemented in Alberta, Canada's major oil and gas producing province. Supported by CAPP and in the industry, the $15/tonne carbon tax feeds a GHG emissions reduction technology fund.

By 2008, the oil sands industry contributes (approximately 3%–4%) of Canada’s GHG emissions (approximately 3%–4%. By 2012, oil sands contributed 0.14% of global GHG emissions. Transportation and electricity were the largest contributors of GHG, with transportation contributing 190 Mt of CO2 equivalent per year (MtCO2eq yr−1) and electricity and heat generation: 125 MtCO2eq yr−1. However, by 2007 (Environment Canada 2007) cautioned that unrestricted development of the oil sands could increase its emissions and the percentage. A 2008 CAPP report argued that both the Alberta and Federal governments adopted "comparable industry GHG emissions targets in which large emitters must reduce their emissions by either improving their operation, purchasing emissions credits or investing in technology funds."&lt;ref name=IOP2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CAPPStewardship&gt;{{cite report|title=CAPP 2008 Facing our Challenges-2007 Stewardship Report|publisher=Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms and concerns===
Canada was the first signatory nation to walk away from the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.  The U.S. abandoned the Kyoto Protocol in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenpeace|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/news-and-blogs/news/u-s-withdraws-from-kyoto-prot/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CAPP initiative 2011: Oil and gas, industry, provincial regulators collaborate on strategies to shape public perception of fracking, water use and shale gas development==
In the summer of 2011 CAPP contacted ENV to requested a meeting with the Canadian Society for Unconventional Gas (CSUG), and officials from several government ministries, including [[Alberta Environment]], Energy, Sustainable Resource Development (SRD), as well as the [[Energy Resources Conservation Board]] (ERCB), (now [[Alberta Energy Regulator]]) to discuss CAPP’s desire to strike a committee to develop a public communications strategy focused on fracturing and water use associated with shale gas development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertasurfacerights.com/articles/?id=1431|series=Documents On The CAPP/ERCB/SRD Fracking Relationship|publisher=Alberta Surface Rights|title=email sent by Doug Bowes, Director of Unconventional Gas, Department of Energy on 8 June 2011 in an e-mail to senior government officials|accessdate=25 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220105538/http://www.albertasurfacerights.com/articles/?id=1431#|archive-date=2015-02-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior-level government and industry officials attended the joint meeting "to develop a plan to shape public perceptions of shale gas development and water use." From Alberta Energy participants included Director of Unconventional Gas Doug Bowes, Associate Branch Head Matthew Foss, Environment and Resource Services Audrey Murray, Executive Director of Resource Development Sharla Rauschning, Assistant Deputy Minister Resource Development Policy Division Jennifer Steber. From Alberta Environment participants included, Deputy Minister Ernie Hui, Former Head of Groundwater Policy within the Water Policy Branch, now the Exec.

===Criticisms and concerns===
By 29 November 2011, the CBC and the Alberta Federation of Labour (AFL), were investigating the role played by CAPP in influencing Alberta Environment over public communications surrounding [[shale gas]] extraction, a controversial practice that has significant environmental concerns associated with it, especially when fracturing is employed. Questions were raised about the legality of private interests influencing government. Complaints were filed and dismissed.&lt;ref name=CBC-Dismiss&gt;{{cite news|title=Illegal lobbying complaint against CAPP dismissed|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/illegal-lobbying-complaint-against-capp-dismissed-1.1266078|accessdate=30 May 2018|newspaper=CBC News|date=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbyist group==
According to the Federal lobbyist registry, from January to September 2012, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers had 178 contacts with federal officials to discuss issues such as pipelines, making it the lobby group with the most contacts that year.

Bass are attracted to this movement and are therefore more likely to bite the lure. The Carolina rig also provides benefits for colder seasons. The heavy weight on the rig allows the bait to reach deeper waters, where fish typically stay in winter months.

'''Color printing''' or '''colour printing''' is the reproduction of an image or text in color (as opposed to simpler black and white  
or [[monochrome]] [[printing]]). Any natural scene or color photograph can be optically and physiologically dissected into three [[primary color]]s, red, green and blue, roughly equal amounts of which give rise to the perception of white, and different proportions of which give rise to the visual sensations of all other colors.  The additive combination of any two primary colors in roughly equal proportion gives rise to the perception of a [[secondary color]]. For example, red and green yields yellow, red and blue yields [[magenta]] (a purple hue), and green and blue yield [[cyan]] (a turquoise hue).  Only yellow is counter-intuitive.
Yellow, cyan and magenta are merely the "basic" secondary colors: unequal mixtures of the primaries give rise to perception of many other colors all of which may be considered "[[tertiary color|tertiary]]."

==Modern techniques==
While there are many techniques for reproducing images in color, specific graphic processes and industrial equipment are used for mass reproduction of color images on paper. In this sense, "color printing" involves reproduction techniques suited for [[printing press]]es capable of thousands or millions of impressions for publishing newspapers and magazines, brochures, cards, posters and similar mass-market items. In this type of industrial or commercial [[printing]], the technique used to print full-color images, such as color photographs, is referred to as '''four-color-process''' or merely '''process''' printing.  Four inks are used: three secondary colors plus black. These ink colors are [[cyan]], [[magenta]], [[yellow]] and [[key plate|key]] ([[black]]); abbreviated as [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]. Cyan can be thought of as minus-red, magenta as minus-green, and yellow as minus-blue.  These inks are semi-transparent or translucent.  Where two such inks overlap on the paper due to sequential printing impressions, a primary color is perceived.  For example, yellow (minus-blue) overprinted by magenta (minus green) yields red. Where all three inks may overlap, almost all incident light is absorbed or subtracted, yielding near black, but in practical terms it is better and cheaper to use a separate black ink instead of combining three colored inks. The secondary or [[subtractive color]]s cyan, magenta and yellow may be considered "primary" by printers and watercolorists (whose basic inks and paints are transparent).

Two graphic techniques are required to prepare images for four-color printing. In the "pre-press" stage, original images are translated into forms that can be used on a printing press, through "color separation," and "screening" or "[[Halftone|halftoning]]." These steps make possible the creation of [[printing plate]]s that can transfer color impressions to paper on printing presses based on the principles of [[lithography]].

An emerging method of full-color printing is '''six-color process printing'''  (for example, [[Pantone]]'s [[Hexachrome]] system) which adds orange and green to the traditional CMYK inks for a larger and more vibrant [[gamut]], or color range. However, such alternate color systems still rely on color separation, halftoning and lithography to produce printed images.

Color printing can also involve as few as one color ink, or multiple color inks which are not the primary colors. Using a limited number of color inks, or specific color inks in addition to the primary colors, is referred to as "[[spot color]]" printing. Generally, spot-color inks are specific formulations that are designed to print alone, rather than to blend with other inks on the paper to produce various hues and shades. The range of available spot color inks, much like paint, is nearly unlimited, and much more varied than the colors that can be produced by four-color-process printing. Spot-color inks range from subtle pastels to intense fluorescents to reflective metallics.

Color printing involves a series of steps, or transformations, to generate a quality color reproduction. The following sections focus on the steps used when reproducing a color image in CMYK printing, along with some historical perspective.

==History of color printing==
[[Woodblock printing on textiles]] preceded printing on paper in both East Asia and Europe, and the use of different blocks to produce patterns in color was common.  The earliest way of adding color to items printed on paper was by hand-coloring, and this was widely used for printed images in both Europe and East Asia. Chinese [[woodcut]]s have this from at least the 13th century, and European ones from very shortly after their introduction in the 15th century, where it continued to be practiced, sometimes at a very skilled level, until the 19th century—elements of the official British [[Ordnance Survey]] maps were hand-colored by boys until 1875.  Early European printed books often left spaces for [[initial]]s, [[rubric]]s and other elements to be added by hand, just as they had been in [[manuscript]]s, and a few early printed books had elaborate borders and [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] added. However this became much rarer after about 1500.

===East Asia===
====China====
British art historian [[Michael Sullivan (art historian)|Michael Sullivan]] writes that "the earliest color printing known in China, and indeed in the whole world, is a two-color [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to a [[Buddhist]] [[sutra]] scroll, dated 1346". Color prints were also used later in the [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Sullivan|title=The Arts of China|edition=Third|date=18 June 1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04918-5|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese [[woodblock printing]], early color woodcuts mostly occur in luxury books about art, especially the more prestigious medium of painting. The first known example is a book on ink-cakes printed in 1606, and color technique reached its height in books on painting published in the seventeenth century. Notable examples are Ming-era Chinese painter [[Hu Zhengyan]]'s ''Treatise on the Paintings and Writings of the Ten Bamboo Studio'' of 1633, and the ''[[Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden]]'' published in 1679 and 1701, and printed in five colors.&lt;ref&gt;L Sickman &amp; A Soper, "The Art and Architecture of China", Pelican History of Art, 3rd ed 1971, Penguin, LOC 70-125675&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
[[File:Eisen1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bijin (beautiful woman) [[ukiyo-e]] by [[Keisai Eisen]], before 1848]]
In Japan, color woodcuts were used for both sheet prints and book illustrations, though these techniques are better known within the history of prints. The "full-color" technique, called [[nishiki-e]] in its fully developed form, spread rapidly, and was used widely for sheet prints from the 1760s on. Text was nearly always monochrome, and many books continued to be published with monochrome illustrations [[sumizuri-e]], but the growth of the popularity of ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' brought with it demand for ever increasing numbers of colors and complexity of techniques. By the nineteenth century most artists designed prints that would be published in color. Major stages of this development were:

*''Sumizuri-e'' (墨摺り絵, "ink printed pictures") - monochrome printing using only black ink
*''Tan-e'' (丹絵) - monochrome sumizuri-e prints with handcoloring; distinguished by use of orange highlights using a red pigment called ''tan''
*"Beni-e" (紅絵, "red pictures") - monochrome sumizuri-e prints with handcoloring; distinguished by use of red ink details or highlights. Should not be confused with "benizuri-e", below.
*''[[Urushi-e]]'' (漆絵) - a method in which glue was used to thicken the ink, emboldening the image; gold, mica and other substances were often used to enhance the image further. This technique was often used in combination with hand coloring. ''Urushi-e'' can also refer to paintings using [[lacquer]] instead of paint; lacquer was very rarely if ever used on prints.
*''[[Benizuri-e]]'' (紅摺り絵, "crimson printed pictures") - images printed in two or three colors, usually containing red and green pigments, as well as black ink. This printing technique should not be confused with "beni-e", above. Both "beni-e" and "benizuri-e" are so named for the predominant reddish colorants, derived from dyes of the safflower plant (beni 紅).
*''Nishiki-e'' (錦絵, "brocade pictures") - a method in which multiple blocks were used for separate portions of the image, allowing a number of colors to be utilized to achieve incredibly complex and detailed images; a separate block would be carved to apply only to the portion of the image designated for a single color. Registration marks called ''kentō'' (見当) were used to ensure correspondence between the application of each block.

Further developments followed from refinements of technique and trends in taste. For instance:

*''[[Aizuri-e]]'' (藍摺り絵, "indigo printed pictures"), ''Murasaki-e'' (紫絵, "purple pictures"), and other styles in which a single color would be used in addition to, or instead of, black ink. These are specialty techniques that grew in popularity in the nineteenth century, though a few examples can be seen earlier.


===Europe===
Most early methods of color printing involved several prints, one for each color, although there were various ways of printing two colors together if they were separate. Liturgical and many other kinds of books required rubrics, normally printed in red; these were long done by a separate print run with a red forme for each page.  Other methods were used for single leaf [[old master print|prints]]. The [[chiaroscuro woodcut]] was a European method developed in the early 16th century, where to a normal woodcut block with a linear image (the "line block"), one or more colored "tone blocks" printed in different colors would be added. This was the method developed in Germany; in Italy only tone blocks were often used, to create an effect more like a wash drawing. [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]] developed a method using three [[intaglio printing|intaglio]] plates, usually in [[mezzotint]]; these were overprinted to achieve a wide range of colors.

In the 19th century a number of different methods of color printing, using woodcut (technically [[Chromoxylography]]) and other methods, were developed in Europe, which for the first time achieved widespread commercial success, so that by the later decades the average home might contain many examples, both hanging as prints and as book illustrations. [[George Baxter (printer)|George Baxter]] patented in 1835 a method using an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] line plate (or occasionally a [[lithograph]]), printed in black or a dark color, and then overprinted with up to twenty different colors from woodblocks. [[Edmund Evans]] used relief and wood throughout, with up to eleven different colors, and latterly specialized in illustrations for children's books, using fewer blocks but overprinting non-solid areas of color to achieve blended colors. English Artists such as [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Walter Crane]] and [[Kate Greenaway]] were influenced by the Japanese prints now available and [[Japonism|fashionable]] in Europe to create a suitable style, with flat areas of color.

[[Chromolithography]] was another process, which by the end of the 19th century had become dominant, although this used multiple prints with a stone for each color. Mechanical color separation, initially using photographs of the image taken with three different color filters, reduced the number of prints needed to three. [[Zincography]], with [[zinc]] plates, later replaced lithographic stones, and remained the most common method of color printing until the 1930s.

==Modern process==

===Color separation process===
[[File:Still-life of fruit using 3-color process.jpg|thumb|The first widely reproduced image printed using the three-color process, by [[William Kurtz]] (January 1893)]]
Typically color separation is the responsibility of the color separator. This includes cleaning up the file to make it print ready and creating a proof for the prepress approval process. The process of color separation starts by separating the original artwork into red, green, and blue components (for example by a digital scanner). Before [[digital imaging]] was developed, the traditional method of doing this was to [[photography|photograph]] the image three times, using a filter for each color. However this is achieved, the desired result is three [[grayscale]] images, which represent the red, green, and blue ([[RGB]]) components of the original image.

The next step is to invert each of these separations. When a negative image of the red component is produced, the resulting image represents the cyan component of the image. Likewise, negatives are produced of the green and blue components to produce magenta and yellow separations, respectively. This is done because cyan, magenta, and yellow are [[subtractive color|subtractive]] primaries which each represent two of the three [[additive color|additive]] primaries (RGB) after one additive primary has been subtracted from white light.

Cyan, magenta, and yellow are the three basic colors used for color reproduction. When these three colors are variously used in printing, the result should be a reasonable reproduction of the original, but in practice this is not the case. Due to limitations in the [[inks]], the darker colors are dirty and muddied. To resolve this, a black separation is also created, which improves the shadow and contrast of the image. Numerous techniques exist to derive this black separation from the original image; these include [[grey component replacement]], [[under color removal]], and [[under color addition]]. This printing technique is referred to as CMYK (the "K" stands for ''key'', a traditional word for the black printing plate).

Today's digital printing methods do not have the restriction of a single [[color space]] that traditional CMYK processes do. Many presses can print from files that were ripped with images using either [[RGB color model|RGB]] or CMYK modes. The color reproduction abilities of a particular color space can vary; the process of obtaining accurate colors within a color model is called [[color matching]].

===Screening===
Inks used in color printing presses are semi-transparent and can be printed on top of each other to produce different hues. For example, green results from printing yellow and cyan inks on top of each other. However, a printing press cannot vary the amount of ink applied to particular picture areas except through "screening," a process that represents lighter shades as tiny dots, rather than solid areas, of ink. This is analogous to mixing white paint into a color to lighten it, except the white is the paper itself. In process color printing, the screened image, or [[halftone]] for each ink color is printed in succession. The screen grids are set at different angles, and the dots therefore create tiny rosettes, which, through a kind of [[optical illusion]], appear to form a continuous-tone image. You can view the halftoning, which enables printed images, by examining a printed picture under magnification.

Traditionally, halftone screens were generated by inked lines on two sheets of glass that were cemented together at [[right angle]]s. Each of the color separation films were then exposed through these screens. The resulting high-contrast image, once processed, had dots of varying diameter depending on the amount of exposure that area received, which was modulated by the grayscale separation film image.

The glass screens were made obsolete by high-contrast films where the halftone dots were exposed with the separation film. This in turn was replaced by a process where the halftones are electronically generated directly on the film with a laser. Most recently, [[computer to plate]] (CTP) technology has allowed printers to bypass the film portion of the process entirely. CTP images the dots directly on the printing plate with a laser, saving money, and eliminating the film step.  The amount of generation loss in printing a lithographic negative onto a lithographic plate, unless the processing procedures are completely ignored, is almost completely negligible, as there are no losses of dynamic range, no density gradations, nor are there any colored dyes, or large silver grains to contend with in an ultra-slow rapid access negative.

Screens with a "frequency" of 60 to 120 lines per inch (lpi) reproduce color photographs in newspapers. The coarser the screen (lower frequency), the lower the quality of the printed image. Highly absorbent [[newsprint]] requires a lower screen frequency than less-absorbent [[coated paper]] stock used in magazines and books, where screen frequencies of 133 to 200 lpi and higher are used.

The measure of how much an ink dot spreads and becomes larger on paper is called [[dot gain]]. This phenomenon must be accounted for in photographic or digital preparation of screened images. Dot gain is higher on more absorbent, uncoated paper stock such as newsprint.

The '''cradle of Henry V''' is, according to tradition, the [[Bassinet|cradle]] in which the newborn [[Henry V of England|Henry of Monmouth]] was placed. The cradle was bought at auction by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]], whose successor later gave it to the [[London Museum]].  Made of oak, it is now believed to date from a century later than the time of Henry V, but is regarded as a unique example of a medieval cradle made for a baby of noble birth.

==History==
The child who was to be Henry V of England was born at [[Monmouth Castle]] on 16 September 1386. He was the son of [[Mary de Bohun]] and [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]], and the grandson of [[John of Gaunt]]. [[Monmouth]] was among Henry of Bolingbroke's possessions and it was where the newly married couple lived for several years. Mary was to die in 1394; Henry Bolingbroke ousted king [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and became Henry IV, King of England, in 1399. The young Henry of Monmouth succeeded his father to become King Henry V in 1413.&lt;ref name=HenryV&gt;[http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/king_england/henry5.php Biography of HENRY V - Archontology.org]. Retrieved 29-3-2012&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cradle of Henry V Mirror of Literature.jpg|thumb|The "Cradle of Henry V" as illustrated in ''Mirror of Literature'' (1825)]]
During the 18th and early 19th centuries the cradle was famous locally and its claim to be a genuine relic of Henry V's childhood was generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;''Mirror of Literature'' vol. 5 no. 121 (1 January 1825) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; It was private property, though often shown to visitors.  In 1839 it was said to have been in the possession of the antiquarian [[George Weare Braikenridge]], of [[Brislington]], [[Bristol]], who was reported to have bought it for £30.&lt;ref name=craik&gt;{{cite book|last=Craik|first=George L.|title=The pictorial history of England: being a history of the people as well a history of the kingdom: p.238|year=1839|publisher=Kight &amp; Co|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOh8PM974M0C&amp;dq=%22Cradle+of+Henry+V%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/Magpie-s-nest-antiquities-catches-city-cameras/story-11343663-detail/story.html  ''Magpie's nest of antiquities catches city before cameras'', ThisIsBath.co.uk, 19 October 2010].  Accessed 13 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the cradle, together with the armour that Henry V allegedly wore at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], were said to be at [[Troy House]] in [[Mitchel Troy]].&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=John Marius|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=989980|title=Descriptive Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales: Entry for MONMOUTH|year=1872}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its location was reported by William Watkins Old, of Monmouth to the [[Royal Historical Society]] in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;William Watkins Old (1876)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cradle was auctioned at [[Christie's]] in [[London]] in 1908 and was bought for 230 [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s by [[Guy Francis Laking|Guy Laking]], King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]'s armourer, bidding on behalf of the King himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Wanganui Chronicle'' (16 April 1908) [http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=WC19080416.1.3&amp;e=-------10--1----0-- Text]&lt;/ref&gt; The cradle then went to [[Windsor Castle]] and remained there for four years. In 1912 the London Museum was established at [[Kensington Palace]] under Guy Laking's direction, and the cradle was given to the Museum by Edward VII's successor, King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kentucky New Era'' (4 June 1912) [[:commons:File:Kentucky New Era Cradle of Henry V 1912.jpg|Report and illustration]]&lt;/ref&gt; The London Museum, now known as the [[Museum of London]], moved to its current site at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]] in 1950.

The cradle, made of oak and with two heraldic birds watching over a suspended crib, is still in the Museum of London. It is now believed to date from the late 15th century, and is a unique example of a mediaeval cradle made for a baby of noble birth.  However, it post-dates the time of Henry V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agefotostock.com/en/Stock-Images/Rights-Managed/HET-1191583  Caption at AgeFotostock.com].  Accessed 13 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Kogai went to middle school, but he had problems with formal education and skipped classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.livedoor.jp/dankogai/archives/51047973.html Kamihitoe], May 10th, 2008 (in Japanese).&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after he graduated from middle school at the age of 16 he passed the high-school equivalence exam, and up until age 18 he spent his time teaching senior students as a tutor and cram school teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.livedoor.jp/dankogai/archives/50670613.html Daigaku ikitakattara gakkō ikanyaka ii no ni] Oct. 27, 2006 (in Japanese).&lt;/ref&gt; He then entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

During his fourth year at university, his family's home burnt down, and he left school.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;[http://blog.livedoor.jp/dankogai/archives/22280762.html Kogai, Dan - Errata, Addeda &amp; FAQ] May 17, 2005 (in Japanese).&lt;/ref&gt; He made a living with the computer skills he had learnt at university, and at age 29 was headhunted by [[Takafumi Horie]] to join [[Livedoor#History|Livin' On the Edge]] (now [[Livedoor]]).&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9842">A '''data steward''' is a role within an organization responsible for utilizing an organization's [[data governance]] processes to ensure fitness of [[data element]]s  - both the content and [[metadata]]. Data stewards have a specialist role that incorporates processes, policies, guidelines and responsibilities for administering organizations' entire data in compliance with policy and/or regulatory obligations. A data steward may share some responsibilities with a [[data custodian]].

The overall objective of a data steward is [[data quality]], in regard to the key/critical data elements existing within a specific enterprise operating structure, of the elements in their respective domains. This includes capturing/documenting (meta)information for their elements (such as: definitions, related rules/governance, physical manifestation, related data models, etc. With most of these properties being specific to an attribute/concept relationship), identifying owners/custodians/various  responsibilities, relations insight pertaining to attribute quality, aiding with project requirement data facilitation and documentation of capture rules. 

Data stewards begin the [[stewardship|stewarding]] process with the identification of the elements which they will steward, with the ultimate result being standards, [[Control (disambiguation)|control]]s and [[Data entry clerk|data entry]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  The steward works closely with business glossary standards analysts (for standards), with [[data architect]]/[[Data modeling|modeler]]s (for standards), with  [[Data quality|DQ]] analysts (for controls) and with [[Computer operator|operations team member]]s (good-quality data going in per business rules) while entering data.

Data stewardship roles are common when organizations attempt to exchange data precisely and consistently between computer systems and to reuse data-related resources.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  [[Master data management]] often{{quantify|date=October 2014}} makes references to the need for data stewardship for its implementation to succeed. Data stewardship must have precise purpose, fit for purpose or fitness.

==Data Steward Responsibilities==
A data steward ensures that each assigned data element:
# Has clear and unambiguous [[data element definition]]
# Does not conflict with other data elements in the metadata registry (removes duplicates, overlap etc.)
# Has clear enumerated value definitions if it is of type [[Code (metadata)|Code]]
# Is still being used (remove unused data elements)
# Is being used consistently in various computer systems
# Is being used, fit for purpose = Data Fitness
# Has adequate documentation on appropriate usage and notes
# Documents the origin and sources of authority on each metadata element
# Is protected against unauthorised access or change

Responsibilities of data stewards vary between different organisations and institutions. For example, at Delft University of Technology, data stewards are perceived as the first contact point for any questions related to research data. They also have subject-specific background allowing them to easily connect with researchers and to contextualise data management problems to take into account disciplinary practices&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=NewMedia Centre|title=1   Data  Stewardship at the TU Delft V2|date=2018-05-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSRocFr6vTM&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Types of data stewards==

Depending on the set of data stewardship responsibilities assigned to an individual, there are 4 types of data stewards typically found within an organization:

# Data object data steward - responsible for managing reference data and attributes of one business data entity
# Business data steward - responsible for managing critical data, both reference and transactional, created or used by one business function
# Process data steward - responsible for managing data across one business process
# System data steward - responsible for managing data for at least one IT system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lightsondata.com/understanding-data-stewardship-types/|title=Understanding the different types of a data steward - LightsOnData|date=2018-06-13|work=LightsOnData|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of data stewardship==

Systematic data stewardship can foster fitness through:

# Consistent use of data management resources
# Easy mapping of data between computer systems and exchange documents
# Lower costs associated with migration to (for example) [[Service Oriented Architecture]] (SOA)

Assignment of each data element to a person sometimes seems like an unimportant process. But many groups{{Which|date=July 2010}} have found that users have greater trust and usage rates in systems where they can contact a person with questions on each data element.

== Examples ==
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}

[[Delft University of Technology|Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)]] offers an example of data stewardship implementation at a research institution. In 2017 the Data Stewardship Project was initiated at TU Delft to address research data management needs in a disciplinary manner across the whole campus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teperek|first=Marta|last2=Cruz|first2=Maria J.|last3=Verbakel|first3=Ellen|last4=Böhmer|first4=Jasmin K.|last5=Dunning|first5=Alastair|date=2018-01-22|title=Data Stewardship – addressing disciplinary data management needs|url=https://osf.io/mjk9t/|journal=Open Science Framework|language=en|doi=10.17605/OSF.IO/MJK9T}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Dedicated data stewards with subject-specific background were appointed at every TU Delft faculty to support researchers with data management questions and to act as a linking point with the other institutional support services. The project is coordinated centrally by TU Delft Library, and it has its own website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/research-data-management/data-stewardship/|title=Data Stewardship|website=TU Delft|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, blog&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://openworking.wordpress.com/data-stewardship/|title=Data Stewardship|date=2018-02-13|work=Open Working|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a YouTube channel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpxLeiN6muCtOv45Bcqhowg/videos|title=Data Stewardship TU Delft|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20061002020733/http://www.epa.gov/edr/][[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] metadata registry furnishes an example of data stewardship.  Note that each data element therein has a "POC"  (point of contact).

== Data Stewardship Applications ==
A new market for data governance applications is emerging, one in which both technical and business staff — stewards — manage policies. These new applications, like previous generations, deliver a strong business glossary capability, but they don't stop there. Vendors are introducing additional features addressing the roles of business in addition to technical stewards' concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+Data+Governance+Stewardship+Applications+Q1+2016/-/E-RES117915|title=The Forrester Wave™: Data Governance Stewardship Applications, Q1 2016|website=www.forrester.com|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information stewardship applications are business solutions used by business users acting in the role of information steward (interpreting and enforcing information governance policy, for example). These developing solutions represent, for the most part, an amalgam of a number of disparate, previously IT-centric tools already on the market, but are organized and presented in such a way that information stewards (a business role) can support the work of information policy enforcement as part of their normal, business-centric, day-to-day work in a range of use cases.

The initial push for the formation of this new category of packaged software came from operational use cases — that is, use of business data in and between transactional and operational business applications. This is where most of the master data management (MDM) efforts are undertaken in organizations. However, there is also now a faster-growing interest in the new data lake arena for more analytical use cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/document/3284717?ref=TypeAheadSearch&amp;qid=744b6ad6c678d064cc2d6eb831a4c959|title=Market Guide for Information Stewardship Applications|last=De Simoni|first=Guido|date=15 April 2016|website=www.gartner.com|publisher=Gartner|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''direct-drive turntable''' is one of the  three main [[phonograph]] designs currently being produced.  The other styles are the  [[belt-drive turntable]] and the idler-wheel type. Each name is based upon the type of coupling used between the platter of the turntable and the motor.

Direct-drive turntables are currently the most popular phonographs, due to their widespread use for [[turntablism]] in DJ culture.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; [[Panasonic]]'s [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] series were the first direct-drive turntables,&lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reverb"/&gt; and remain the most popular series of turntables.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;

== Design ==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2009}}

In a direct-drive turntable the motor is located directly under the center of the platter and is connected to the platter directly. It is a significant advancement over older [[belt-drive turntable]]s, which are unsuitable for [[turntablism]], since they have a slow start-up time, and are prone to wear-and-tear and breakage,&lt;ref name="medium"&gt;Brian Coleman, [https://medium.com/@briancoleman/the-technics-1200-hammer-of-the-gods-xxl-fall-1998-5b93180a67da The Technics 1200 — Hammer Of The Gods], [[Medium (website)|Medium]]&lt;/ref&gt; as the belt would break from backspinning or [[scratching]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LApZ8KV7bZAC&amp;pg=PA43 ''The World of DJs and the Turntable Culture'', page 43], [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A direct-drive turntable eliminates belts, and instead employs a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Trevor Pinch, Karin Bijsterveld, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KuRfLG0IedYC&amp;pg=PA515 ''The Oxford Handbook of Sound Studies'', page 515], [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes scratching possible, as the motor would continue to spin at the correct [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] even if the DJ wiggles the record back and forth on the platter.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2002/05/blackbox/ Six Machines That Changed The Music World], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, direct-drive turntables may suffer from vibration due to the motor, which is less of an issue for belt-drive turntables. However, in recent years{{When|date=October 2016}}, shock-absorbing (less dense) material, placed between the motor and platter, has been used to cut back on vibrations.  The [[torque]] on direct-drive turntables is usually much higher than on belt drive models. This means the platter speed is less susceptible to outside forces ([[stylus]], hand). Higher torque also means the platter will accelerate to its proper speed faster so less distortion is heard when the record begins to play.

Some direct-drive turntables further reduce the separation of motor and platter by using the platter itself as the [[rotor (electric)|rotor]] in the turntable's [[synchronous motor]]. This means that there is no motor, per se, in the turntable - the platter is entirely driven by the magnetic field induced by the turntable's [[stator]].

In all turntables a motor spins a metal disk at a constant speed. On top of the rotating disk ([[Platter (turntable)|platter]]) is a mat and on top of the mat records are placed to be played. In the past rubber mats were used to hold the record in place so that it would not rotate independently of the platter. Nowadays [[slipmat]]s are used to reduce the friction between the spinning platter and record, and is often made of a felt-like material.  This way a [[DJ]] can [[Scratching|scratch]] the record while the platter continues to spin underneath.  In direct-drive turntables, the slipmat also helps isolate the record from motor vibrations that would be picked up by the stylus.

Many turntables also include a [[pitch control]], for fine tuning to the correct speed, used in conjunction with a strobe light, plus it also allows a DJ to [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] using a technique known as [[beatmatching]]. From the late 1990s onwards manufacturers such as [[Vestax]] started to include other electronic controls such as reverse, and "nudge".

[[DJ]]s and [[Turntablism|turntablists]] use all the above functions to assist them in musical performances.

==History==
{{See also|Turntablism}}

The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] (now [[Panasonic]]),&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', May 21, 1977, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XCMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT140 page 140]&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="medium"/&gt; It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; In 1969, Matsushita released it as the [[Technics (brand)|SP-10]],&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; the first direct-drive turntable on the market,&lt;ref name="reverb"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Record Player Part II: The Rise and Fall|url=https://reverb.com/news/history-of-the-record-player-part-ii-the-rise-and-fall|website=[[Reverb.com]]|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first in their influential [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] series of turntables.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; In 1971, Matsushita released the Technics SL-1100. Due to its strong motor, durability, and fidelity, it was adopted by early [[hip hop]] artists.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;

A forefather of turntablism was [[DJ Kool Herc]], an immigrant from [[Jamaica]] to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="reverb"/&gt; He introduced turntable techniques from Jamaican [[dub music]],&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;Nicholas Collins, Margaret Schedel, Scott Wilson (2013), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bQeAtG97BmEC&amp;pg=PA105 ''Electronic Music: Cambridge Introductions to Music'', page 105], [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; while developing new techniques made possible by the direct-drive turntable technology of the [[Technics (brand)|Technics SL-1100]], which he used for the first [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]] he set up after emigrating to New York.&lt;ref name="reverb"/&gt; The signature technique he developed was playing two copies of the same record on two turntables in alternation to extend the [[Breakdancing|b-dancers]]' favorite section,&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt; switching back and forth between the two to [[Music loop|loop]] the [[Break (music)|breaks]] to a rhythmic beat.&lt;ref name="reverb"/&gt;

The most influential turntable was the [[Technics SL-1200]],&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; which was developed in 1971 by a team led by Shuichi Obata at Matsushita, which then released it onto the market in 1972.&lt;ref name="medium"/&gt; It was adopted by [[New York City]] hip hop DJs such as [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]] and [[Afrika Bambaataa]] in the 1970s. As they experimented with the SL-1200 decks, they developed scratching techniques when they found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; Since then, turntablism spread widely in hip hop culture, and the SL-1200 remained the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for the next several decades.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;

Technics also introduced the first direct-drive [[Linear tracking#Linear tracking|tangential-arm]] turntable, the model [[Technics SL-10|SL-10]], in 1981.

[[Image:Angeln zubehoer hacken.jpg|thumb|right|Fishing line with hooks attached]]
A '''fishing line''' is a cord used or made for [[angling]]. Important parameters of a fishing line are its length, material, and weight (thicker lines are more visible to fish). Factors that may determine what line an angler chooses for a given fishing environment include [[breaking strength]], knot strength, UV resistance, castability, limpness, stretch, abrasion resistance, and visibility. Most modern lines are made from nylon or silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Book Encyclopedia Volume 7|last=|first=|publisher=Field Enterprises Educational Corp.|year=1968|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Fish are caught with a fishing line by encouraging a fish to bite on a [[fish hook]]. A fish hook will pierce the mouthparts of a fish and is normally barbed to make escape less likely. Another method is to use a gorge, which is buried in the bait such that it would be swallowed end first. The tightening of the line would fix it cross-wise in the quarry's stomach or gullet and so the capture would be assured.

Fishing with a hook and line is called [[angling]]. In addition to the use of the hook and line used to catch a fish, a heavy fish may be landed by using a landing net or a hooked pole called a [[Gaff (fishing)|gaff]].

[[troll (angling)|Trolling]] is a technique in which a [[fishing lure]] on a line is drawn through the water. Trolling from a moving boat is a technique of [[big-game fishing]] and is used to catch large open-water species such as [[tuna]] and [[marlin]]. Trolling is also a freshwater angling technique often used to catch [[salmon]], [[northern pike]], [[muskellunge]] and [[walleye]]. This technique allows anglers to cover a large body of water in a short time.

[[Long-line fishing]], also known as a [[trot line]] is a commercial fishing technique that uses many baited hooks hanging from a single line.

Snagging is a technique where the object is to hook the fish in the body. Generally, a large treble hook with a heavy sinker is cast into a river containing a large amount of fish, such as a Salmon, and is quickly jerked and reeled in. Due to the often illegal nature of this method some practitioners have added methods to disguise the practice, such as adding bait or piercing the jerking motion.

==Early lines==
As written in 1667 by Samuel Pepys, the fishing lines in his time were made from [[catgut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Book Encyclopedia Volume 7|last=|first=|publisher=Field Enterprises Educational Corp.|year=1968|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, silk fishing lines were used around 1724.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Book Encyclopedia Volume 7|last=|first=|publisher=Field Enterprises Educational Corp.|year=1968|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern lines==
[[File:Filet de pêche DSC00632.JPG|thumb|Fishing line]]
Modern fishing lines intended for spinning, spin cast, or bait casting reels are almost entirely made from artificial substances, including [[nylon]], [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF, also called fluorocarbon), [[polyethylene]], [[Dacron]] and [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|UHMWPE]] (Honeywell's [[Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene#Fiber|Spectra]] or [[Dyneema]]). The most common type is ''[[monofilament line|monofilament]]'', made of a single strand. Fishermen often use monofilament because of its buoyant characteristics and its ability to stretch under load. The line stretch has advantages, such as dampening the force when setting the hook and when fighting strong fish. On very far distances the dampening may become a disadvantage. Recently, other alternatives to standard nylon monofilament lines have been introduced made of copolymers or fluorocarbon, or a combination of the two materials. Fluorocarbon fishing line is made of the [[fluoropolymer]] PVDF and it is valued for its [[refractive index]], which is similar to that of water, making it less visible to fish. Fluorocarbon is also a denser material, and therefore, is not nearly as buoyant as monofilament. Anglers often utilize fluorocarbon when they need their baits to stay closer to the bottom without the use of heavy sinkers. There are also [[braided fishing line]]s, ''cofilament'' and ''thermally fused'' lines, also known as 'superlines' for their small diameter, lack of stretch, and great strength relative to standard nylon monofilament lines. Braided, thermally fused, and chemically fused varieties of '[[Multifilament fishing line|superlines]]' are now readily available.

===Specialty lines===
[[Fly fishing tackle#Fly lines|''Fly lines'']] consist of a tough braided or monofilament core, wrapped in a thick waterproof plastic sheath, often of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC). In the case of floating fly lines, the PVC sheath is usually embedded with many 'microballoons' or air bubbles, and may also be impregnated with silicone or other lubricants to give buoyancy and reduce wear. In order to fill up the reel spool and ensure an adequate reserve in case of a run by a powerful fish, fly lines are usually attached to a secondary line at the butt section, called backing. Fly line backing is usually composed of braided dacron or gelspun monofilaments. All fly lines are equipped with a leader of monofilament or fluorocarbon fishing line, usually (but not always) tapered in diameter, and referred to by the 'X-size' (0X, 2X, 4X, etc.) of its final tip section, or tippet. Tippet size is usually between 0X and 8X, where 0X is the thickest diameter and 8X is the thinnest. There are exceptions to this, and tippet sizes do exist outside of the 0X-8X paramter. &lt;ref&gt;Carter Reschke, [https://www.flyfevermag.com/blog/what-tippet-size-to-use-the-ultimate-guide-to-tippet-size "What Tippet Size to Use"], ''Fly Fever Magazine'', October 24 2018&lt;/ref&gt;


[[Tenkara fishing|''Tenkara lines'']] are special lines used for the fixed-line fishing method of tenkara. Traditionally these are furled lines the same length as the tenkara rod. Although original to Japan, these lines are similar to the British tradition of [[furled leader]]. They consist of several strands being twisted together in decreasing numbers toward the tip of the line, thus creating a taper that allows the line to cast the fly. It serves the same purpose as the fly-line, to propel a fly forward. They may be tied of various materials, but most commonly are made of monofilament.

''Wire lines'' are frequently used as leaders to prevent the fishing line from being severed by toothy fish. Usually braided from several metal strands, wire lines may be made of [[stainless steel]], [[titanium]], or a combination of metal alloys coated with plastic.

'''Stainless steel line leaders''' provide:

- bite protection - it is extremely hard for fish to cut the steel wire, regardless of jaw and teeth strength and sharpness,

- abrasion resistance - sharp rocks and objects can damage other lines, while steel wire can cut through most of the materials,

- single wire (single strand) leaders are not as flexible as multi strand steel wire, but are extremely strong and tough,

- multi strand steel wire leaders are very flexible, but are somewhat more abrasive and more damage prone than single strand wires.

'''Titanium fishing fishing leaders''' are actually titanium-nickel alloys that have several very important features:

- titanium leader lines are very flexible, regardless if they are single or multi strand lines/wires,

- these lines are very elastic - they can stretch up to 10% without permanent damage to the line itself - perfect for hook setting,

- these lines are knottable just as nylon monofilament lines,

- surface is rather hard and abrasion resistant - great for fishing toothy fish,

- titanium wire is corrosion resistant and can last for a long time, even surpassing stainless steel wires,

- due to the strength and elasticity, titanium wires are almost entirely kink-proof.

[[Copper wire and cable|'''Copper''']], '''[[monel]]''' and [[Lead|'''lead core''']] fishing lines are used as heavy trolling main lines, usually followed with fluorocarbon line near the lure or bait with [[fishing swivel]] between the lines. Due to their high density, these fishing lines sink rapidly in water and they require less line for achieving desired trolling depth. On the other hand, these lines are relatively thick for desired strength, especially when compared with braided fishing lines and they often require reels with larger spools.

==Environmental impact==
Discarded monofilament fishing line takes up to 600 years to decompose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/wmb/coastal/trash/documents/marine_debris.pdf | title=Approximate Time it Takes for Garbage to Decompose in the Environment | publisher=NH Department of Environmental Services | accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several types of biodegradable fishing lines developed to minimize the impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.fieldandstream.com/blogs/bass-fishing/2009/09/merwin-does-bioline-biodegradeable-fishing-line-measure Merwin: Does Bioline (Biodegradeable Fishing Line) Measure Up?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5002">Two forms of GAL are available. The first is '''General Automation Language''' for device automation and the second is '''Generalized Automation Language''' ('''GAL''') which a very [[high-level programming language|high level]] [[programming language]] for [[MVS]] based systems such as [[OS/390]] and [[z/OS]].

==General Automation Language==
Developed by iLED to provide a common language for standardising automation and control of devices in the residential (Home Automation) and commercial control environments. The language provides a standardised method of communicating to/from controlled/controlling devices. At each device, GAL is converted into the machine specific protocol and medium. An example is the control of a DVD player. The GAL command will be &lt;code&gt;&lt;MyHouse MyArea MyRoom MyDevice MyCommand&gt; FredsHouse GroundFloor Lounge DVDplayer ON&lt;/code&gt;. The GAL device will then convert this to the discrete IR command to switch on the DVD Player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iled.co.za/ezicontrol/ |publisher= iLED |title= Technology convergence with eZiControl }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- close, but still not the orignal ref lost to history --&gt;

==Generalized Automation Language==
Developed by Expans Systems to provide features and constructs that enable the programmer to intercept systems events and schedule responses, as implemented via their product [[Automan]]. Somewhat akin to BASIC, GAL enables systems programmers and operators to define logic to apply to systems messages as they flow through a multi-system ([[IBM Parallel Sysplex#Sysplex|sysplex]]) environment. GAL also enables the programmer to define events that have occurred in the past, by intercepting Action Message Retention Facility (AMRF) messages. The language has built-in constructs to obtain the age of a retained message and make decisions about its fate depending on age. GAL can be used to write new systems commands, by intercepting and interpreting anything that is entered into an Operator Console. GAL uses keywords such as names of days of the week, names of month etc. to automatically schedule events in the system. Like [[REXX]], GAL is both an interpretive language and a compiled language. GAL statements can be entered to the interpreter on the fly, or entire automation scenarios can be predefined, such as the logic to define unattended operations of a system, and can be compiled offline, using the compiler program GALCOMP.

GAL implements comparison by IF statements, setting of variables, by the LET statement and subroutine calls. GAL allows the programmer to break into REXX, and Assembler where it is needed. The very high level nature of GAL is exemplified by the EMAIL statement, which enables the programmer to send an email alert when an event is detected that requires human intervention. Assuming that this message event requires an alert to be sent to a default recipient:

:&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
  MSG=XID999S                                
      VAR &amp;MSGTXT LEN 100                  
      LET &amp;MSGTXT = $$MSGTXT               
      EMAIL                             
         SUBJECT '&amp;MSGTXT'           
         'This is a problem that needs urgent attention'
&lt;/source&gt;

GAL uses text capture and replacement facilities. In this simple example, the text of the system message is captured into a variable and the text in that variable is then used as the subject of the email. The message in the body of the email is the text in quotes following the subject.

GAL allows for cross systems([[IBM XCF]]) queries to be issued by simple IF statements, without regard for the underlying internal processes required to perform the cross systems communications. It is simply a matter of identifying one or more systems that are to be tested.

For instance to check if a job is currently running in a partner system:

:&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
 IF SYS=sysn JOB(jobname) ACTIVE
 DO
  . . .
 END
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Scotland Inchnadamph Assynt Hatchery.jpg|thumb|[[Assynt]] Salmon Hatchery, near [[Inchnadamph]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]].]]

A '''hatchery''' is a facility where [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s are hatched under artificial conditions, especially those of [[fish]] or [[poultry]]. It may be used for [[ex-situ conservation]] purposes, i.e. to breed [[rare species|rare]] or [[endangered species]] under controlled conditions; alternatively, it may be for economic reasons (i.e. to enhance food supplies or [[fishery]] resources).

==Fish hatcheries==
{{main|Fish hatchery}}
[[Image:Colorado Pikeminnow spawn 05-25-05 (62).JPG|thumb|right|250 px|Stripping eggs]]
Fish hatcheries are used to cultivate and breed a large number of fish in an enclosed environment.  [[Fish farm]]s use hatcheries to cultivate fish to sell for food, or ornamental purposes, eliminating the need to find the fish in the wild and even providing some species outside their natural season. They raise the fish until they are ready to be eaten or sold to aquarium stores. Other hatcheries release the juvenile fish into a river, lake or the [[ocean]] to support commercial, tribal, or recreational [[fishing]] or to supplement the natural numbers of [[threatened species|threatened]] or [[endangered species]], a practice known as [[fish stocking]].

Researchers have raised concerns about hatchery fish potentially breeding with wild fish.  Hatchery fish may in some cases compete with wild fish.&lt;ref&gt;''Genetics and the Extinction of Species'', Laura F. Landweber and Andrew P. Dobson eds., [[Princeton University]] Press (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States and Canada, there have been several salmon and steelhead hatchery reform projects intended to reduce the possibility of negative impacts from hatchery programs.  Most salmon and steelhead hatcheries are managed better and follow up to date management practices to ensure any risks are curtailed.

==Poultry hatcheries==
Poultry hatcheries produce a majority of the birds consumed in the developed world including [[chicken]]s, [[turkeys]], ducks, geese, and some other minor bird species. A few poultry hatcheries specialize in producing birds for sale to backyard poultry keepers, hobby farmers, and people who are interested in competing with their birds at poultry shows. These hatcheries produce chicks of several different breeds and varieties, often including some heritage or endangered breeds.

Larger poultry hatcheries are related to industrial poultry meat or egg production. This is a multibillion dollar industry, with highly regimented production systems used to maximize bird size or egg production versus feed consumed.  Generally large numbers are produced at one time so the resulting birds are uniform in size and can be harvested (for meat) or brought into production (for eggs) at the same time. A large hatchery produces 15 million chicks annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beltz|first1=Mike|title=Trillium Hatchery to build $20-million chick hatchery in Stratford's Wright Business Park|url=http://www.stratfordbeaconherald.com/2017/02/07/trillium-hatchery-to-build-20-million-chick-hatchery-in-stratfords-wright-business-park|accessdate=7 February 2017|work=Stratford Beacon Herald|date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poultry generally start with naturally (most species) or artificially (turkeys and Cornish-related chicken breeds) [[insemination|inseminated]] hens that lay eggs; the eggs are cleaned and shells are checked for soundness before being put into the incubators. Incubators control temperature and humidity, and turn the eggs until just before they hatch. Three days before the eggs are scheduled to hatch, they are moved into a hatcher unit, where they are no longer turned so the embryos have time to get properly oriented for their exit from the shell, and the temperature and humidity are optimum for hatching. Once the eggs hatch and the chicks are a few days old, they are often vaccinated.

'''Heated humidified high-flow'''  ('''HHHF''') therapy is a type of respiratory support method that delivers a high flow (liters per minute) of medical gas to a patient through an interface (nasal cannulae) intended to create a wash-out of the upper airway.  The applied gas is heated to best match human body temperature (37 [[Celsius]]) and humidified targeting ideal body [[saturation vapor pressure]].

==Medical uses ==
High-flow therapy is useful in patients that are spontaneously breathing but have an increased work of breathing.  Conditions such as general respiratory failure, asthma exacerbation, COPD exacerbation, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure are all possible situations where high-flow therapy may be indicated. HHHF has been used in spontaneously breathing patients with during general anaesthesia to facilitate surgery for airway obstruction. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Booth|first=A. W.

===Newborn babies===
High-flow therapy has shown to be useful in [[neonatal intensive care]] settings for premature infants with [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Due to the decreased stress of effort needed to breathe, the neonatal body is able to spend more time utilizing metabolic efforts elsewhere, which causes decreased days on a [[mechanical ventilator]], faster weight gain, and overall decreased hospital stay entirely.&lt;ref name="PMID17855805"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=17855805|year=2007|author1=Holleman-Duray|first1=D|title=Heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula: Use and a neonatal early extubation protocol|journal=Journal of Perinatology|volume=27|issue=12|pages=776–81|last2=Kaupie|first2=D|last3=Weiss|first3=M.

High flow therapy has been successfully implemented in infants and older children. The cannula improves the respiratory distress, the oxygen saturation, and the patient's comfort. Its mechanism of action is the application of mild positive airway pressure and lung volume recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spentzas|first=Thomas|last2=Minarik|first2=Milan|last3=Patters|first3=Andrea B.|last4=Vinson|first4=Brett|last5=Stidham|first5=Greg|date=2009-10-01|title=Children with respiratory distress treated with high-flow nasal cannula|journal=Journal of Intensive Care Medicine|volume=24|issue=5|pages=323–328|doi=10.1177/0885066609340622|issn=1525-1489|pmid=19703816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
HFT, the clinician can deliver higher FiO2 to the patient than is possible with typical oxygen delivery therapy without the use of a [[non-rebreather mask]] or [[tracheal intubation]].  Heated humidification of the respiratory gas facilitates secretion clearance and decreases the development of bronchial hyper-response symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roca | first1 = O. | last2 = Riera | first2 = J. | last3 = Torres | first3 = F. | last4 = Masclans | first4 = J.

Most patients find HFT more comfortable than using oxygen masks.  As this is a non-invasive therapy, it avoids the risk of [[ventilator-associated pneumonia]] in situations where it can supplant the use of a ventilator.

== Mechanism==
Oxygenation is achieved by providing an increased FiO2 in the air flow to the patient.  The constant flush of the upper airway creates a reservoir that reduces room-air entrainment to such an amount that it becomes a true fraction of inspired oxygen as set by the device.

===Ventilation ===
Through a nasal cannula a high-flow system delivers flows that approach (and can meet) total respiratory demand.&lt;ref name="PMID21171186"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=3332105|year=2011|author1=Frizzola|first1=M|title=High-Flow Nasal Cannula: Impact on Oxygenation and Ventilation in an Acute Lung Model|journal=Pediatric Pulmonology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=67–74|last2=Miller|first2=T.

H.|last9=Dysart|first9=K|doi=10.1002/ppul.21326|pmid=21171186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This flow, being delivered though a small diameter delivery system and small-bore nasal cannula allows the flow that would traditionally move slowly through the upper airway to move quickly and maintain a constant stream of fresh gas which effectively washes out upper airway dead space.&lt;ref name="PMID19467849"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=19467849|year=2009|author1=Dysart|first1=K|title=Research in high flow therapy: Mechanisms of action|journal=Respiratory Medicine|volume=103|issue=10|pages=1400–5|last2=Miller|first2=T.

This constant stream of fresh gas flow creates an environment that assists exhalation effort by flushing the exhaled air out to maintain this reservoir of fresh air ready to be inhaled.

=== Humidification===
The higher the flow, the more important proper humidification and conditioning of the flow becomes.  Without humidity, the oxygenation and ventilation effects of high-flow therapy would be quickly overcome by the negative impact that dry air has on lung tissue.&lt;ref name="PMID20144858"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=20144858|year=2010|author1=Rea|first1=H|title=The clinical utility of long-term humidification therapy in chronic airway disease|journal=Respiratory Medicine|volume=104|issue=4|pages=525–33|last2=McAuley|first2=S|last3=Jayaram|first3=L|last4=Garrett|first4=J|last5=Hockey|first5=H|last6=Storey|first6=L|last7=O'Donnell|first7=G|last8=Haru|first8=L|last9=Payton|first9=M|last10=O'Donnell|first10=K|doi=10.1016/j.rmed.2009.12.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID19327183"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=19327183|year=2009|author1=Solomita|first1=M|title=Y-piece temperature and humidification during mechanical ventilation|journal=Respiratory care|volume=54|issue=4|pages=480–6|last2=Daroowalla|first2=F|last3=Leblanc|first3=D.

== History ==
[[Nasal cannula]] used for medical gas delivery are usually limited to delivery of 1–6 liters of flow per minute. The percent oxygen inhaled by the patient ([[FiO2]]), usually ranges roughly 24–35% as the pure oxygen delivered from the cannula is diluted by entrainment of ambient air (21% oxygen). Flow rates for delivery of oxygen using typical nasal cannula are limited because medical oxygen is [[anhydrous]], and when delivered from a pressurized source the gas cools as it expands with the drop to atmospheric pressure.  Delivery of cold dry gas is irritating to the respiratory mucosa, can cause drying and bleeding of the nasal mucosa and can increase metabolic demand by cooling the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Waugh | first1 = J. B. | last2 = Granger | first2 = W. M. | title = An evaluation of two new devices for nasal high-flow gas therapy | journal = Respiratory care | volume = 49 | issue = 8 | pages = 902–906 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15271229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with quiet breathing, the inspiratory flow rate at the nares of an adult usually exceeds 12 liters a minute, and can exceed 30 liters a minute for someone with mild respiratory distress.  Traditional oxygen therapy is limited to six liters a minute and does not begin to approach the inspiratory demand of an adult and therefore the oxygen is then diluted with room air during inspiration.

Prior to the advent of HFT, when increased FiO2 was required for respiratory support; special face masks or intubation was required.  With High Flow Therapy, the goal is to deliver a respiratory gas flow volume sufficient to meet or exceed the patient's inspiratory flow rate.  The gas is heated and humidified to condition the gas as increased flows would be detrimental to tissue if left dry and cool.

HFT, a source of oxygen is usually blended with compressed air. Hospitals usually have 50 psi compressed oxygen and air available for therapeutic use. This allows the delivery of air or blends of air and oxygen with the use of an [[oxygen blender]].  The gas is then heated, generally to about 37&amp;nbsp;°C, and humidified to near 100% [[Relative humidity|RH]] using a [[humidifier]]. The gas is transported to the patient through a heated delivery tube to prevent cooling and condensation of the [[water vapor]] that has been added to the respiratory gas(es).

HFT requires the use of [[nasal cannula]]e and a system designed to deliver high flow rates and the pressure generated to do so. At the same time the nasal cannula must be small enough that they do not occlude more than 50% of the nares, as this allows flow to have multiple points of exit for a continuous airway flush effect.

== Commercial developments ==
Vapotherm introduced the concept of heated humidified high flow therapy via nasal cannula in 1999 after being originally developed for use in race horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waugh |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.clinicalfoundations.org/assets/foundations3.pdf |title=Trends in Noninvasive Respiratory Support: Continuum of Care |format=PDF |publisher=Clinical Foundations |accessdate=2014-04-24 }}

One of the key elements of these standards is the definition of [[Transducer electronic data sheet]]s (TEDS) for each transducer. The TEDS is a memory device attached to the transducer, which stores transducer identification, calibration, correction data, and manufacturer-related information.  The goal of the IEEE 1451 family of standards is to allow the access of transducer data through a common set of interfaces whether the transducers are connected to systems or networks via a wired or wireless means.

&lt;/ref&gt;  TEDS formats are defined in the IEEE 1451 set of [[smart transducer]] interface standards developed by the [[IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society]]'s Sensor Technology Technical Committee that describe a set of open, common, network-independent communication interfaces for connecting transducers  to microprocessors, instrumentation systems, and control/field networks.

One of the key elements of the IEEE 1451 standards is the definition of TEDS for each transducer. The TEDS can be implemented as a memory device attached to the transducer and containing information needed by a measurement instrument or control system to interface with a transducer. TEDS can, however, be implemented in two ways.  First, the TEDS can reside in embedded memory, typically an [[EEPROM]], within the transducer itself which is connected to the measurement instrument or control system.  Second, a virtual TEDS can exist as a data file accessible by the measurement instrument or control system. A virtual TEDS extends the standardized TEDS to legacy sensors and applications where embedded memory may not be available.

'''InfinityDB''' is an all-[[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[embedded database]] engine and client/server DBMS with an extended java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentNavigableMap interface (a subinterface of java.util.Map) that is deployed in handheld devices, on servers, on workstations, and in distributed settings. The design is based on a proprietary lockless, concurrent, [[B-tree]] architecture that enables client programmers to reach high levels of performance without risk of failures. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A new Client/Server version 5.0 is in alpha testing, wrapping the established embedded version to provide shared access via a secure, remote server.

In the embedded system, data is stored to and retrieved from a single embedded database file using the InfnityDB [[Application Programming Interface|API]] that allows direct access to the variable length item spaces. Database client programmers can construct traditional relations as well as specialized models that directly satisfy the needs of the dependent application. There is no limit to the number of items, database size, or [[Java virtual machine|JVM]] size, so InfinityDB can function in both the smallest environment that provides random access storage and can be scaled to large settings. Traditional relations and specialized models can be directed to the same database file. InfinityDB can be optimized for standard relations as well as all other types of data, allowing client applications to perform at a minimum of one million operations per second on a virtual, 8-core system.

'''AirConcurrentMap,''' is an in-memory map that implements the Java ConcurrentMap interface,&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/map.html&lt;/ref&gt; but internally it uses a multi-core design so that its performance and memory make it the fastest Java Map when ordering is performed and it holds medium to large numbers of entries.&lt;ref&gt;http://boilerbay.com/docs/AirConcurrentMap_Performance_Testing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; AirConcurrentMap iteration is faster than any Java Map iterators, regardless of the specific map type.

== Map API ==

InfinityDB can be accessed as an extended standard java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentNavigableMap, or via a low-level 'ItemSpace' API. The ConcurrentNavigableMap interface is a subinterface of java.util.Map but has special ordering and concurrency methods: this is the same API as java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListMap. Maps may be nested to form complex structures. The Maps have the standard semantics, but work internally on a 'tuple space', while the Maps are not actually stored but are helpers, each representing nothing more than an immutable tuple prefix. Maps may be created dynamically at high speed if needed for access, and are thread-safe and multi-core concurrent. The key and value types available include all Java primitive data types, Dates, Strings, small char or byte arrays, 'ByteStrings', 'huge array' indexes, Character Long Objects or Binary Long Objects, plus the special-purpose types 'EntityClass' and 'Attribute'. Maps may be multi-valued. Applications may choose to use the Map-based access alone and may mix in lower-level 'ItemSpace' access over the same tuples, as the Map access is just a wrapper and there is no tuple-level distinction.

== The lower level 'ItemSpace' data model ==

The data primitives are called 'components' and they are atomic. Components can be concatenated into short composites called 'Items' which are the unit of storage and retrieval. Higher-level structures that combine these Items include unlimited size records of an unlimited number of columns or attributes, with complex attribute values of unlimited size. Keys may be a composition of components. Attribute values can be ordered sets of composite components,  [[character large object]]s (CLOB's), [[binary large object]]s (BLOB's), or unlimited [[sparse array]]s. Other higher-level structures built of multiple Items include key/value associations like ordered maps, ordered sets, Entity-Attribute-Value nets of quadruples, trees, DAG's, taxonomies, or full-text indexes. Mixtures of these can occur along with custom client-defined structures.

==Data encoding==

An 'ItemSpace' represents the entire database, and it is a simple ordered set of Items, with no other state. An Item is actually stored with each component encoded in variable-length binary form in a char array, with components being self-describing in a standard format which sorts correctly. Programmers deal with the components only as primitives, and the stored data is strongly typed. Data is not stored as text to be parsed with weak typing as in [[JSON]] or [[XML]], nor is it parsed out of programmer-defined binary stream representations.  There are no custom client-devised binary formats that can grow brittle, and which can have security, documentation, upgrade, testing, versioning, scaling, and debugging problems, such as is the case with Java Object serialization.

==Performance scaling==

All access to the system is via a few basic methods that can store or retrieve in order one variable-length 'Item' or 'tuple' at a time at a speed which is on the order of 1M operations/second aggregated over multiple threads when in memory. The operations are either the standard Map API for &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;put()&lt;/code&gt;, iterators, and so on, or at the lower level, &lt;code&gt;insert()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;delete()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;update()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;first()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;next()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;last()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;previous()&lt;/code&gt;. Typical Items are about 30 bytes uncompressed in memory, but LOB's for example use 1&amp;nbsp;KB Items. Because each operation affects only one Item, small data structures are fast to access. This is in contrast to chunked access, such as for example formatting and parsing entire JSON or XML texts or entire Java Object serialization graphs. The space and performance scaling of an ItemSpace is smooth as any size of client-imposed multi-Item structure is created, grows, shrinks, or disappears. On-storage performance is like any block-oriented B-tree, with blocks of about 4&amp;nbsp;KB, which is ''O''(log(''n'')) per access. There is a block cache of 2.5&amp;nbsp;MB by default, which is of unlimited size but which is often about 100&amp;nbsp;MB. The cache grows only as needed.

==Space Scaling==

For performance and efficiency, the Items are stored inside a single B-tree prefix-compressed and variable length as an uninterpreted sequence of bytes for further compression. The B-tree may typically grow to the 100&amp;nbsp;GB's range but has no limits. There is only one file, so there is no log or other files to write to and flush. InfinityDB minimizes the size of its database file through four types of [[data compression|compression]] ([[prefix code|prefix]], suffix, [[zlib]], and [[UTF-8]]). 

==Schemaless upgrade and downgrade==

[[database schema|schema]] upgrade when structures are extended or modified is done by adding or removing Items in new ways at runtime, and there are no upgrade scripts - hence the data model is NoSQL and schemaless. Because an empty or non-existent piece of data requires no space by virtue of having no Items associated with it, it is possible to extend the structure simply by adding Items of new kinds. If Items are removed, all logical and physical space is immediately reclaimed.

For example, backwards compatibility with older databases in a relational model while making a single-valued attribute into a multi-value attribute can be achieved simply by storing more values (one per Item) alongside the existing one without deleting the existing one, since every attribute is already logically multi-value and is logically composite. There is little code change and no internal or external database structure change. If a value is deleted and it is the last value of a multi-value attribute, all of its space is recovered immediately. In other words, every attribute can logically store an ordered set of optionally composite values, but there is no cost for the generality in common cases, and no cost at all for null values.

If a new table is to be added, it is created at the moment its first row is inserted. The first row appears only when the first attribute value is added to it. Forwards compatibility with future databases is possible because future databases may have new tables or any other structure that can be discovered and used, can be simply ignored or can be handled opaquely by older code.

==Transactionality==

Both global 'ACD' and per-thread 'ACID' transactions are provided. Each InfinityDB instance stores data into a single database file and does not require additional log or rollback files. In the event of any catastrophe except power failure or other hardware malfunction, the database is guaranteed to be consistent with the status as of completion of the last global commit. Recovery after abrupt termination is immediate and requires no slow log replay. Bulk loading is globally transactional with unlimited data size, and is concurrent with all other uses. Global transactions do not provide inter-thread isolation, so the semantics are 'ACD' (rather than 'ACID'). Alternatively, ACID transactions employ optimistic locking to allow inter-thread isolation.

==Immediate garbage collection==

As data structures grow and shrink, freed space is reclaimed immediately and made available for other structures. Systems can run indefinitely without gradual space leaks or long interruptions during garbage reclamation phases. When a data structure becomes empty, all of its space is recycled, rather than leaving behind 'tombstones' or other place holders. For example, a possibly very large multi-value attribute may shrink to one value, becoming as efficient as any single-valued attribute, and if that last value is deleted, all space for it is reclaimed, including the space for the attribute it was attached to, and if a row has only attributes with no values, the row is reclaimed completely as well. If a table loses all of its rows, the space for the table is reclaimed. Any size or type of data structure has this property. There are no reference counters, hence any type of graph is incrementally collected automatically.

==Products==

{{farming}}

'''Intensive farming''' involves various types of [[agriculture]] with higher levels of input and output per cubic unit of [[agricultural land]] area. It is characterized by a low [[ley farming|fallow]] ratio, higher use of inputs such as [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Labour (economics)|labour]], and higher [[crop yield]]s per cubic unit land area.&lt;ref name="britannicaRef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042533|title=Encyclopædia Britannica's definition of Intensive Agriculture|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcFactSheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/biology/livingthingsenvironment/4foodandsustainabilityrev5.shtml|title=BBC - Error 404 : Not Found|author=|date=|website=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with [[history of agriculture|traditional agriculture]], in which the inputs per unit land are lower. The term "intensive" involves various meanings, some of which refer to [[organic farming]] methods (such as [[biointensive agriculture]] and [[French intensive gardening]]), and others that refer to nonorganic and industrial methods. [[Intensive animal farming]] involves either large numbers of animals raised on limited land, usually [[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s (CAFOs), often referred to as factory farms,&lt;ref name="britannicaRef" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Factory+farming|title=- Define  at Dictionary.com|author=|date=|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannicaRefFactoryFarm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9364147|title=Encyclopædia Britannica's definition of Factory farm|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[managed intensive rotational grazing]] (MIRG), which has both organic and non-organic types. Both increase the yields of food and fiber per acre as compared to traditional animal husbandry. In CAFO, feed is brought to the seldom-moved animals, while in MIRG the animals are repeatedly moved to fresh forage.

Most [[commerce|commercial]] agriculture is intensive in one or more ways. Forms that rely heavily on [[industrial engineering|industrial methods]] are often called industrial agriculture, which is characterised by [[innovation]]s designed to increase yield. Techniques include planting multiple crops per year, reducing the frequency of fallow years, and improving [[cultivar]]s. It also involves increased use of [[fertilizer]]s, plant growth regulators, and [[pesticide]]s and [[mechanised agriculture]], controlled by increased and more detailed analysis of growing conditions, including weather, [[soil]], water, weeds, and pests. This system is supported by ongoing innovation in [[agricultural machinery]] and farming methods, [[genetic engineering|genetic technology]], techniques for achieving [[economies of scale]], [[logistics]], and [[data collection]] and [[data analysis|analysis]] technology. Intensive farms are widespread in [[developed nation]]s and increasingly prevalent worldwide. Most of the [[meat]], [[dairy]], [[Egg (food)|egg]]s, [[fruits]], and [[vegetables]] available in [[supermarket]]s are produced by such farms.

Smaller intensive farms usually include higher inputs of labor and more often use sustainable intensive methods. The farming practices commonly found on such farms are referred to as [[appropriate technology]]. These farms are less widespread in both developed countries and worldwide, but are growing more rapidly. Most of the food available in specialty markets such as [[farmers markets]] is produced by these small holder farms.

==History==
{{Main|Agriculture#Modern developments|British Agricultural Revolution}}
[[File:Agriculture (Plowing) CNE-v1-p58-H.jpg|thumb|Early 20th-century image of a tractor ploughing an [[alfalfa]] field]]
Agricultural development in Britain between the 16th century and the mid-19th century saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output. This in turn supported unprecedented population growth, freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce, and thereby helped enable the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Historians cited [[enclosure]], [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization]], [[four-field crop rotation]], and [[selective breeding]] as the most important innovations.&lt;ref&gt;* Overton, Mark. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/agricultural_revolution_01.shtml Agricultural Revolution in England 1500 - 1850] (September 19, 2002), BBC.

* Kagan, Donald. ''The Western Heritage'' (London: Prentice Hall, 2004), p. 535-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial agriculture arose along with the [[Industrial Revolution]]. By the early 19th century, agricultural techniques, implements, seed stocks, and [[cultivar]]s had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Kingsbury"&gt;{{cite book|author=Noel Kingsbury|year=2009|title=Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrialization phase involved a continuing process of mechanization. Horse-drawn machinery such as the [[McCormick reaper]] revolutionized harvesting, while inventions such as the [[cotton gin]] reduced the cost of processing. During this same period, farmers began to use [[Traction engine|steam-powered]] [[threshing machine|threshers]] and [[tractor]]s, although they were expensive and dangerous.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In 1892, the first [[gasoline engine|gasoline-powered]] tractor was successfully developed, and in 1923, the [[International Harvester]] [[Farmall]] tractor became the first all-purpose tractor, marking an inflection point in the replacement of draft animals with machines. Mechanical harvesters ([[combine harvester|combines]]), planters, transplanters, and other equipment were then developed, further revolutionizing agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec32.pdf|title=Agricultural Scientific Revolution: Mechanical|author=Janick, Jules|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These inventions increased yields and allowed individual farmers to manage increasingly large farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/52548/52645.aspx|title=The Impact of Mechanization on Agriculture|journal=The Bridge on Agriculture and Information Technology|date=Fall 2011|volume=41|author=Reid, John F.|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification of [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[potassium]] (NPK) as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic [[fertilizer]]s, further increasing [[crop yields]]. In 1909, the [[Haber-Bosch]] method to synthesize [[ammonium nitrate]] was first demonstrated. NPK fertilizers stimulated the first concerns about industrial agriculture, due to concerns that they came with serious side effects such as [[Soil compaction (agriculture)|soil compaction]], [[soil erosion]], and declines in overall [[soil fertility]], along with health concerns about toxic chemicals [[food chain|entering the food supply]].&lt;ref name="Stinner2007"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2007 |author=Stinner, D.H |chapter=The Science of Organic Farming |editor=William Lockeretz |title=Organic Farming: An International History |publisher=Oxfordshire, UK &amp; Cambridge, Massachusetts: CAB International (CABI) |isbn=978-0-85199-833-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=25QnL3-njZQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Organic+farming%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 April 2013 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The identification of [[carbon]] as a critical factor in plant growth and [[soil health]], particularly in the form of [[humus]], led to so-called sustainable agriculture, as well as alternative forms of intensive agriculture that also surpassed traditional agriculture, without side effects or health issues. Farmers adopting this approach were initially referred to as ''humus farmers'', later as ''organic farmers''.

The discovery of [[vitamin]]s and their role in [[nutrition]], in the first two decades of the 20th century, led to vitamin supplements, which in the 1920s allowed some livestock to be raised indoors, reducing their exposure to adverse natural elements.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Chemicals developed for use in [[World War II]] gave rise to synthetic [[pesticide]]s.

Following [[World War II]], synthetic fertilizer use increased rapidly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/HomePage/SUSTAINABILITY/Climate-change/A-historical-perspective.html|title=A Historical Perspective|publisher=International Fertilizer Industry Association|accessdate=2013-05-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309153521/http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/HomePage/SUSTAINABILITY/Climate-change/A-historical-perspective.html|archivedate=2012-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while sustainable intensive farming advanced much more slowly. Most of the resources in developed nations went to improving industrial intensive farming, and very little went to improving [[organic farm]]ing. Thus, particularly in the developed nations, industrial intensive farming grew to become the dominant form of agriculture.

The discovery of [[antibiotic]]s and [[vaccine]]s facilitated raising livestock in confined animal feeding operations by reducing diseases caused by crowding.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}  Developments in logistics and refrigeration as well as processing technology made long-distance distribution feasible.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Between 1700 and 1980, "the total area of cultivated land worldwide increased 466%" and yields increased dramatically, particularly because of [[selective breeding|selectively-bred]], high-yielding varieties, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, and machinery.&lt;ref name="Matson1997"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matson|year=1997|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/277/5325/504?ck=nck |title=Agricultural Intensification and Ecosystem Properties|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.277.5325.504|volume=277|issue=5325|pages=504–9|pmid=20662149|last2=Parton|first2=WJ|last3=Power|first3=AG|last4=Swift|first4=MJ|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global agricultural production doubled between 1820 and 1920; between 1920 and 1950; between 1950 and 1965; and again between 1965 and 1975 to feed a global population that grew from one billion in 1800 to 6.5 billion in 2002.&lt;ref name="dominion"&gt;Matthew Scully  [https://books.google.com/books?id=4lSplJlgc_sC Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy] Macmillan, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} The number of people involved in farming in industrial countries dropped, from 24 percent of the American population to 1.5 percent in 2002. In 1940, each farmworker supplied 11 consumers, whereas in 2002, each worker supplied 90 consumers.&lt;ref name="dominion" /&gt;{{rp|29}} The number of farms also decreased and their ownership became more concentrated. In the year 2000 in the U.S., four companies produced 81 percent of cows, 73 percent of sheep, 57 percent of pigs, and 50 percent of chickens, which was cited as an example of "[[vertical integration]]" by the president of the U.S. National Farmers Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/judiciary/hju67334.000/hju67334_0.htm#0 Testimony by Leland Swenson], president of the U.S. National Farmers' Union, before the House Judiciary Committee, September 12, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1967 and 2002, the one million pig farms in America consolidated into 114,000,&lt;ref name="dominion" /&gt;{{rp|29}} with 80 million pigs (out of 95 million) produced each year on factory farms, according to the U.S. National Pork Producers Council.&lt;ref name="dominion" /&gt;{{rp|29}}  According to the [[Worldwatch Institute]], 74 percent of the world's poultry, 43 percent of beef, and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way.&lt;ref name="WW2006"&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/bookstore/publication/state-world-2006-special-focus-china-and-india State of the World 2006] Worldwatch Institute&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}}

Concerns over the [[sustainability]] of industrial agriculture, which has become associated with [[land degradation|decreased]] [[soil quality]], and over the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides, have not subsided. Alternatives such as [[integrated pest management]] (IPM) have had little impact because policies encourage the use of pesticides and IPM is knowledge-intensive.&lt;ref name="Matson1997" /&gt; These concerns sustained the [[organic movement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/04/history-nitrogen-fertilizer-ammonium-nitrate|author=Philpott, Tom|title=A Brief History of Our Deadly Addiction to Nitrogen Fertilizer|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=2013-05-07|publisher=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused a resurgence in sustainable intensive farming, as well as funding for the development of appropriate technology.

The essence of such farms is the concentration of livestock in a given space. The aim is to provide maximum output at the lowest possible cost and with the greatest level of food safety.&lt;ref&gt;Danielle Nierenberg (2005)'' Happier Meals: Rethinking the Global Meat Industry''. Worldwatch Paper 121: 5&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used pejoratively.&lt;ref name="encyc-organic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duram|first=Leslie A. |title=Encyclopedia of Organic, Sustainable, and Local Food|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0-313-35963-6|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, CAFOs have dramatically increased the production of food from animal husbandry worldwide, both in terms of total food produced and efficiency.

Food and water is delivered to the animals, and therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents, vitamin supplements, and growth hormones are often employed. Growth hormones are not used on chickens nor on any animal in the [[European Union]]. Undesirable behaviors often related to the stress of confinement led to a search for docile breeds (e.g., with natural dominant behaviors bred out), physical restraints to stop interaction, such as individual cages for chickens, or physical modification such as the de-beaking of chickens to reduce the harm of fighting.

The CAFO designation resulted from the 1972 U.S. [[Federal Clean Water Act]], which was enacted to protect and restore lakes and rivers to a "fishable, swimmable" quality. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) identified certain animal feeding operations, along with many other types of industry, as "point source" [[groundwater]] polluters.

These lagoons can be as large as {{convert|7.5|acre|m2}}. Lagoons not protected with an impermeable liner can leak into groundwater under some conditions, as can runoff from manure used as fertilizer. A lagoon that burst in 1995 released 25 million gallons of nitrous sludge in North Carolina's [[New River (North Carolina)|New River]]. The spill allegedly killed eight to ten million fish.&lt;ref&gt;Orlando, Laura. ''McFarms Go Wild'', ''Dollars and Sense'', July/August 1998, cited in Scully, Matthew. ''Dominion'', St. Martin's Griffin, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

The large concentration of animals, animal waste, and dead animals in a small space poses ethical issues to some consumers. [[Animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]] activists have charged that intensive animal rearing is cruel to animals.

Other concerns include persistent noxious odor, the effects on human health, and the role of antibiotic use in the rise of resistant infectious bacteria.

According to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), farms on which animals are intensively reared can cause adverse health reactions in farm workers. Workers may develop acute and/or chronic lung disease, musculoskeletal injuries, and may catch ( [[zoonotic]]) infections from the animals.

====Managed intensive rotational grazing====
{{Main|Managed intensive rotational grazing}}
Managed Intensive Rotational Grazing (MIRG), also known as cell grazing, mob grazing, and [[Holistic management|holistic management planned grazing]], is a variety of foraging in which herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh, rested grazing areas to maximize the quality and quantity of [[forage]] growth. MIRG can be used with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys, ducks, and other animals. The herds graze one portion of pasture, or a paddock, while allowing the others to recover. Resting grazed lands allows the vegetation to renew energy reserves, rebuild shoot systems, and deepen root systems, resulting in long-term maximum [[biomass]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Beetz, A.E.  2004.  Rotational grazing: Livestock systems guide.  National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service  (ATTRA).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Pastures for profit: A guide to rotational grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/A3529.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin Extension|accessdate=5 April 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MIRG is especially effective because grazers thrive on the more tender younger plant stems. MIRG also leaves parasites behind to die off, minimizing or eliminating the need for de-wormers.  Pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements, and with the increased productivity of MIRG systems, the animals obtain the majority of their nutritional needs, in some cases all, without the supplemental feed sources that are required in continuous grazing systems.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"&gt;Undersander, D., Albert, B., Cosgrove, D., Johnson, D., Peterson, P.  2002.

====Pasture intensification====
Pasture intensification is the improvement of [[pasture]] soils and grasses to increase the food production potential of livestock systems. It is commonly used to reverse pasture [[Land degradation|degradation]], a process characterized by loss of [[forage]] and decreased animal [[carrying capacity]] which results from [[overgrazing]], poor [[nutrient management]], and lack of [[soil conservation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268445014_Degradacao_recuperacao_e_renovacao_de_pastagens|title=Degradação, recuperação e renovação de pastagens|last=Zimmer|first=Ademir|last2=Macedo|first2=Manuel|last3=Neivo Kichel|first3=Armindo|last4=Almeida|first4=Roberto|date=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This degradation leads to poor pasture soils with decreased [[Soil fertility|fertility]] and [[Soil water (retention)|water availability]] and increased rates of [[soil erosion|erosion]], [[Soil compaction (agriculture)|compaction]], and [[Soil acidification|acidification]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Figueiredo|first=Eduardo Barretto|last2=Jayasundara|first2=Susantha|last3=Bordonal|first3=Ricardo de Oliveira|last4=Berchielli|first4=Telma Teresinha|last5=Reis|first5=Ricardo Andrade|last6=Wagner-Riddle|first6=Claudia|last7=Jr.|first7=Newton La Scala|title=Greenhouse gas balance and carbon footprint of beef cattle in three contrasting pasture-management systems in Brazil|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.132|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=142|pages=420–431|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degraded pastures have significantly lower [[Agricultural productivity|productivity]] and higher [[carbon footprint]]s compared to intensified pastures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.embrapa.br/busca-de-publicacoes/-/publicacao/1015344/indicativo-de-pastagens-plantadas-em-processo-de-degradacao-no-bioma-cerrado|title=Indicativo de pastagens plantadas em processo de degradação no bioma Cerrado. - Portal Embrapa|website=www.embrapa.br|language=pt-BR|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bogaerts|first=Meghan|last2=Cirhigiri|first2=Lora|last3=Robinson|first3=Ian|last4=Rodkin|first4=Mikaela|last5=Hajjar|first5=Reem|last6=Junior|first6=Ciniro Costa|last7=Newton|first7=Peter|title=Climate change mitigation through intensified pasture management: Estimating greenhouse gas emissions on cattle farms in the Brazilian Amazon|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.130|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=162|pages=1539–1550|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cardoso|first=Abmael S.|last2=Berndt|first2=Alexandre|last3=Leytem|first3=April|last4=Alves|first4=Bruno J.R.|last5=Carvalho|first5=Isabel das N.O. de|last6=Soares|first6=Luis Henrique de Barros|last7=Urquiaga|first7=Segundo|last8=Boddey|first8=Robert M.|title=Impact of the intensification of beef production in Brazil on greenhouse gas emissions and land use|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2015.12.007|journal=Agricultural Systems|volume=143|pages=86–96|doi=10.1016/j.agsy.2015.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Talamini|first=Edson|last2=Ruviaro|first2=Clandio Favarini|last3=Florindo|first3=Thiago José|last4=Florindo|first4=Giovanna Isabelle Bom De Medeiros|title=Improving feed efficiency as a strategy to reduce beef carbon footprint in the Brazilian Midwest region|url=http://www.inderscience.com/link.php?id=10007706|journal=International Journal of Environment and Sustainable Development|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|doi=10.1504/ijesd.2017.10007706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruviaro|first=Clandio F.|last2=Léis|first2=Cristiane Maria de|last3=Lampert|first3=Vinícius do N.|last4=Barcellos|first4=Júlio Otávio Jardim|last5=Dewes|first5=Homero|title=Carbon footprint in different beef production systems on a southern Brazilian farm: a case study|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.01.037|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=96|pages=435–443|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.01.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Management practices which improve soil health and consequently [[Poaceae|grass]] productivity include [[irrigation]], soil scarification, and the application of [[Agricultural lime|lime]], [[fertilizer]]s, and [[pesticide]]s. Depending on the productivity goals of the target agricultural system, more involved restoration projects can be undertaken to replace [[Invasive species|invasive]] and under-productive grasses with grass species that are better suited to the [[soil]] and [[climate]] conditions of the region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These intensified grass systems allow higher [[Livestock grazing comparison|stocking rates]] with faster animal weight gain and reduced time to slaughter, resulting in more productive, carbon-efficient [[livestock]] systems.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another technique to optimize [[Crop yield|yield]] while maintaining the [[Carbon cycle re-balancing|carbon balance]] is the use of integrated crop-livestock (ICL) and crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) systems, which combine several ecosystems into one optimized agricultural framework.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277247305_Integrated_systems_what_they_are_their_advantages_and_limitations|title=Integrated systems: what they are, their advantages and limitations|last=Balbino|first=Luiz|last2=Neivo Kichel|first2=Armindo|last3=Bungenstab|first3=Davi|last4=Almeida|first4=Roberto|date=2014-03-01|isbn=9788570352972|pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These synergies between these systems provide benefits to pastures through optimal [[plant]] usage, improved [[Fodder|feed]] and fattening rates, increased [[soil fertility]] and quality, intensified [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]], integrated [[pest control]], and improved [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The introduction of certain [[legume]] crops to pastures increases [[Carbon sequestration|carbon accumulation]] and [[nitrogen fixation]] in soils, while their digestibility helps animal fattening and reduces [[methane emissions]] from [[enteric fermentation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ICLF systems yield beef cattle productivity up to ten times that of degraded pastures, additional crop production from [[maize]], [[sorghum]], and [[soybean]] harvests, and greatly reduced [[greenhouse gas]] balances due to forest carbon sequestration.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Crops===
{{Main|Intensive crop farming}}

The [[Green Revolution]] transformed farming in many developing countries. It spread technologies that had already existed, but had not been widely used outside of industrialized nations. These technologies included "miracle seeds", pesticides, [[irrigation]], and synthetic nitrogen [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;Brown, 1970. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Seeds ====
In the 1970s, scientists created strains of [[maize]], [[wheat]], and [[rice]] that are generally referred to as high-yielding varieties (HYV).  HYVs have an increased nitrogen-absorbing potential compared to other varieties. Since cereals that absorbed extra nitrogen would typically lodge (fall over) before harvest, semi-dwarfing genes were bred into their genomes. [[Norin 10 wheat]], a variety developed by [[Orville Vogel]] from Japanese [[dwarf wheat]] varieties, was instrumental in developing wheat cultivars. IR8, the first widely implemented HYV rice to be developed by the [[International Rice Research Institute]], was created through a cross between an Indonesian variety named “Peta” and a Chinese variety named “Dee Geo Woo Gen.”&lt;ref name="ir8"&gt;Rice Varieties: IRRI Knowledge Bank. Accessed Aug. 2006. {{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/nepal/RiceVarieties.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713032524/http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/nepal/RiceVarieties.htm |archivedate=2006-07-13 |df= }} &lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

With the availability of molecular genetics in [[Arabidopsis]] and rice the mutant genes responsible (''reduced height (rht)'', ''gibberellin insensitive (gai1)'' and ''slender rice (slr1)'') have been cloned and identified as cellular signalling components of [[gibberellic acid]], a [[phytohormone]] involved in regulating stem growth via its effect on cell division. Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more mechanically stable. Nutrients become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the yield effect of chemical fertilizers. 
 
HYVs significantly outperform traditional varieties in the presence of adequate irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers. In the absence of these inputs, traditional varieties may outperform HYVs. They were developed as [[F1 hybrids]], meaning seeds need to be purchased every season to obtain maximum benefit, thus increasing costs.

====Crop rotation====
{{Main|Crop rotation}}
[[Image:Crops Kansas AST 20010624.jpg|thumb|300px|Satellite image of circular crop fields in [[Haskell County, Kansas]], in late June 2001. Healthy, growing crops of [[maize|corn]] and [[sorghum]] are green (sorghum may be slightly paler). [[Wheat]] is brilliant gold. Fields of brown have been recently harvested and plowed under or have lain in fallow for the year.]]
Crop rotation or crop sequencing is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of [[crops]] in the same space in sequential seasons for benefits such as avoiding pathogen and pest buildup that occurs when one species is continuously cropped. Crop rotation also seeks to balance the nutrient demands of various crops to avoid [[soil nutrient]] depletion. A traditional component of crop rotation is the replenishment of [[nitrogen]] through the use of [[legumes]] and [[green manure]] in sequence with cereals and other crops. Crop rotation can also improve [[soil structure]] and [[Soil fertility|fertility]] by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. A related technique is to plant multi-species [[cover crops]] between commercial crops. This combines the advantages of intensive farming with continuous cover and [[polyculture]].

====Irrigation====
{{Main|Irrigation}}
[[Image:PivotIrrigationOnCotton.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Overhead irrigation, [[center pivot irrigation|center-pivot]] design]]
Crop [[irrigation]] accounts for 70% of the world's fresh water use.&lt;ref&gt;Pimentel, Berger, et al., "Water resources: agricultural and environmental issues", BioScience 54.10 (Oct 2004), p909&lt;/ref&gt;

[[surface irrigation|Flood irrigation]], the oldest and most common type, is typically unevenly distributed, as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts. [[Irrigation#Overhead (sprinkler) irrigation|Overhead irrigation]], using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers, gives a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern. [[Drip irrigation]] is the most expensive and least-used type, but delivers water to plant roots with minimal losses.

[[Water catchment]] management measures include recharge pits, which capture rainwater and runoff and use it to recharge groundwater supplies. This helps in the replenishment of groundwater wells and eventually reduces soil erosion. Dammed rivers creating [[reservoirs]] store water for irrigation and other uses over large areas. Smaller areas sometimes use irrigation ponds or groundwater.

====Weed control====
{{Main|Weed control}}
In agriculture, systematic weed management is usually required, often performed by machines such as cultivators or liquid herbicide sprayers. [[Herbicides]] kill specific targets while leaving the crop relatively unharmed. Some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often based on plant [[hormones]]. [[Weed control]] through [[herbicide]] is made more difficult when the weeds become resistant to the herbicide. Solutions include:
* Cover crops (especially those with [[allelopathic]] properties) that out-compete weeds or inhibit their regeneration
* Multiple herbicides, in combination or in rotation
* Strains genetically engineered for herbicide tolerance
* Locally adapted strains that tolerate or out-compete weeds
* Tilling
* [[Ground cover]] such as [[mulch]] or plastic
* Manual removal
* Mowing
* Grazing
* Burning

====Terracing====
[[Image:Terrace field yunnan china denoised.jpg|right|thumb|Terrace rice fields in Yunnan Province, China]]
{{Main|Terrace (agriculture)}}
In [[agriculture]], a [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] is a leveled section of a [[hill]]y cultivated area, designed as a method of [[soil conservation]] to slow or prevent the rapid [[surface runoff]] of [[irrigation]] water. Often such land is formed into multiple terraces, giving a stepped appearance. The human landscapes of [[rice]] cultivation in terraces that follow the natural contours of the escarpments, like [[contour ploughing]], are a classic feature of the island of [[Bali]] and the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] in [[Banaue, Ifugao]], [[Philippines]]. In [[Peru]], the [[Tahuantinsuyu|Inca]] made use of otherwise unusable slopes by building [[drystone wall]]s to create terraces.

====Rice paddies====
{{Main|Paddy field}}
A '''paddy field''' is a flooded parcel of [[arable land]] used for growing [[rice]] and other [[Aquatic plant|semiaquatic crops]]. Paddy fields are a typical feature of rice-growing countries of [[East Asia|east]] and [[southeast Asia]], including [[Malaysia]], [[China]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Taiwan]], [[Indonesia]], [[India]], and the [[Philippines]]. They are also found in other rice-growing regions such as [[Piedmont]] (Italy), the [[Camargue]] (France), and the [[Artibonite Valley]] (Haiti). They can occur naturally along [[river]]s or [[marshes]], or can be constructed, even on hillsides. They require large water quantities for [[irrigation]], much of it from flooding. It gives an environment favourable to the strain of rice being grown, and is hostile to many [[species]] of [[weed]]s. As the only [[draft animal]] species which is comfortable in [[wetlands]], the [[water buffalo]] is in widespread use in Asian rice paddies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghgonline.org/methanerice.htm|title=Methane - Rice|author=|date=|website=www.ghgonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paddy-based rice-farming has been practiced in Korea since ancient times. A [[pit-house]] at the Daecheon-ni archaeological site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates indicating that rice cultivation may have begun as early as the Middle [[Jeulmun Pottery Period]] (c. 3500–2000 BC) in the [[Korean Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Agricultural origins in the Korean Peninsula|first = Gary W. |last=Crawford |first2=Gyoung-Ah |last2=Lee|date = 2003|journal = Antiquity|doi = |pmid = |volume= 77 |issue=295  |pp=87–95 |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest rice cultivation there may have used dry-fields instead of paddies.

The earliest [[Mumun]] features were usually in naturally swampy, low-lying narrow gulleys and fed by local streams. Some Mumun paddies in flat areas were made of a series of squares and rectangles separated by bunds approximately 10&amp;nbsp;cm in height, while terraced paddies were long and irregular in shape, following the natural contours of the land at various levels.&lt;ref&gt;Bale 2001; Kwak 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Like today, Mumun period rice farmers used terracing, bunds, canals, and small reservoirs. Some paddy-farming techniques of the Middle Mumun period (c. 850–550 BC) can be interpreted from the well-preserved wooden tools excavated from archaeological rice paddies at the Majeon-ni site. [[Iron]] tools for paddy-farming were not introduced until sometime after 200 BC. The spatial scale of individual paddies, and thus entire paddy-fields, increased with the regular use of [[Iron Age|iron tools]] in the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] Period (c. AD 300/400–668).

A recent development in the intensive production of rice is [[System of Rice Intensification]] (SRI). Developed in 1983 by the [[France|French]] [[Jesuit]] [[Priest|Father]] [[Henri de Laulanie|Henri de Laulanié]] in [[Madagascar]],&lt;ref name=henri&gt;[http://www.tropicultura.org/text/v29n3/183.pdf Intensive Rice Farming in Madagascar] by H. De Laulanié, in [http://www.tropicultura.org/ Tropicultura], 2011, 29, 3, 183-187&lt;/ref&gt; by 2013 the number of smallholder farmers using SRI had grown to between 4 and 5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vidal|first=John|title=India's rice revolution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/feb/16/india-rice-farmers-revolution|work=The Observer|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=21 May 2013|location=London|date=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquaculture===
{{Main|Aquaculture}}
Aquaculture is the cultivation of the natural products of [[water]] ([[fish]], [[shellfish]], [[algae]], [[seaweed]], and other aquatic organisms). Intensive aquaculture takes place on land using  tanks, ponds, or other controlled systems, or in the ocean, using cages.&lt;ref name="AmericanHeritageDef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/aquaculture|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|author=|date=|website=Answers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGrawHillDef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/aquaculture|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|author=|date=|website=Answers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable intensive farming===
{{further|Sustainable farming|Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture|Zero waste agriculture|Organic farming}}

Sustainable intensive farming practices have been developed to slow the deterioration of agricultural land and even regenerate [[soil health]] and [[ecosystem services]], while still offering high yields. Most of these developments fall in the category of organic farming, or the integration of organic and conventional agriculture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Organic systems and the practices that make them effective are being picked up more and more by conventional agriculture and will become the foundation for future farming systems. They won't be called organic, because they'll still use some chemicals and still use some fertilizers, but they'll function much more like today's organic systems than today's conventional systems."

[[The System of Crop Intensification]] (SCI) was born out of research primarily at Cornell University and smallholder farms in India on SRI. It uses the SRI concepts and methods for rice and applies them to crops like wheat, sugarcane, finger millet, and others. It can be 100% organic, or integrated with reduced conventional inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SRI CONCEPTS AND METHODS APPLIED TO OTHER CROPS|url=http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/aboutsri/othercrops/|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The System of Crop Intensification Agroecological Innovations for Improving Agricultural Production, Food Security, and  Resilience to Climate Change|url=http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/aboutsri/othercrops/SCImonograph_SRIRice2014.pdf|website=SRI International Network and Resources Center|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pasture cropping involves planting grain crops directly into grassland without first applying herbicides. The perennial grasses form a living mulch understory to the grain crop, eliminating the need to plant cover crops after harvest. The pasture is intensively grazed both before and after grain production using holistic planned grazing. This intensive system yields equivalent farmer profits (partly from increased livestock forage) while building new [[topsoil]] and [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering]] up to 33 tons of CO2/ha/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leu|first1=Andre|title=Mitigating Climate Change With Soil Organic Matter  in Organic Production Systems|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/ditcted2012d3_en.pdf|website=Trade and environment review 2013, Commentary V pp.22-32|publisher=UNCTAD|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first= Kirsten| title=Why Pasture Cropping is such a Big Deal|url=http://milkwood.net/2010/12/07/why-pasture-cropping-is-such-a-big-deal/|publisher=Milkwood|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture]] (IMTA) is an example of a holistic approach. IMTA is a practice in which the by-products (wastes) from one species are recycled to become inputs ([[fertilizer]]s, [[food]]) for another. Fed [[aquaculture]] (e.g. [[fish]], [[shrimp]]) is combined with inorganic extractive (e.g. [[seaweed]]) and organic extractive aquaculture (e.g. [[shellfish]]) to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability (biomitigation), economic stability (product diversification and risk reduction), and social acceptability (better management practices).&lt;ref name="Chopin et al. 2001"&gt;Chopin T, Buschmann AH, Halling C, Troell M, Kautsky N, Neori A, Kraemer GP, Zertuche-Gonzalez JA, Yarish C and Neefus C. 2001. Integrating seaweeds into marine aquaculture systems: a key toward sustainability. Journal of Phycology 37: 975-986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biointensive]] agriculture focuses on maximizing efficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://agriwaterpedia.info/wiki/Water_use_efficiency|title = Water use efficiency|accessdate = December 2014|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as per unit area, energy input, and water input. [[Agroforestry]] combines agriculture and orchard/forestry technologies to create more integrated, diverse, productive, profitable, healthy, and sustainable land-use systems.

[[Intercropping]] can increase yields or reduce inputs and thus represents (potentially sustainable) agricultural intensification. However, while total yield per acre is often increased dramatically, yields of any single crop often diminish.  There are also challenges to farmers relying on farming equipment optimized for [[monoculture]], often resulting in increased labor inputs.

[[Vertical farming]] is intensive crop production on a large scale in urban centers, in multi-story, artificially-lit structures, using far less inputs and producing fewer environmental impacts.

An integrated farming system is a progressive, biologically-integrated [[sustainable agriculture]] system such as IMTA or [[Zero waste agriculture]], whose implementation requires exacting knowledge of the interactions of multiple species and whose benefits include sustainability and increased profitability. Elements of this integration can include:
* Intentionally introducing flowering plants into agricultural ecosystems to increase pollen-and nectar-resources required by natural enemies of insect pests&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifs.orst.edu/insect.html Oregon State University - Integrated Farming Systems - Insectary Plantings - Enhancing Biological Control with Beneficial Insectary Plants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615043253/http://ifs.orst.edu/insect.html |date=2006-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
{{See also|Agricultural policy|Agribusiness}}

The challenges and issues of industrial agriculture for society, for the industrial agriculture sector, for the individual farm, and for [[animal rights]] include the costs and benefits of both current practices and proposed changes to those practices.&lt;ref name=challenges&gt;[http://www.abareconomics.com/interactive/ausNZ_ag/htm/au_change.htm Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics] article ''Agricultural Economies of Australia and New Zealand ''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="information management"&gt;[http://www.regional.org.au/au/roc/1995/roc1995001.htm The Regional Institute] article ''Evolution of the Farm Office''&lt;/ref&gt; This is a continuation of thousands of years of invention in feeding ever-growing populations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''[W]hen hunter-gatherers with growing populations depleted the stocks of game and wild foods across the Near East, they were forced to introduce agriculture. But agriculture brought much longer hours of work and a less rich diet than hunter-gatherers enjoyed. Further population growth among shifting slash-and-burn farmers led to shorter fallow periods, falling yields and soil erosion. Plowing and fertilizers were introduced to deal with these problems - but once again involved longer hours of work and degradation of soil resources (Boserup, The Conditions of Agricultural Growth, Allen and Unwin, 1965, expanded and updated in Population and Technology, Blackwell, 1980.).''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the point of industrial agriculture is to profitably supply the world at the lowest  cost, industrial methods have significant side effects. Further, industrial agriculture is not an indivisible whole, but instead is composed of multiple elements, each of which can be modified in response to market conditions, government regulation, and further innovation, and has its own side-effects. Various interest groups reach different conclusions on the subject.&lt;ref name=challenges/&gt;&lt;ref name="information management"/&gt;

===Population growth===
{{See also|World population|History of agriculture}}

[[Image:Population curve.svg|thumb|right|350px|Population (estimate) [[10th millennium BC|10,000 BCE]]&amp;ndash;2000 CE]]
Very roughly:
* 30,000 years ago [[hunter-gatherer]] behavior fed 6 million people
* 3,000 years ago [[primitive agriculture]] fed 60 million people
* 300 years ago [[intensive agriculture]] fed 600 million people
* Today '''industrial agriculture''' attempts to feed 8 billion people

Between 1930 and 2000, U.S. agricultural productivity (output divided by all inputs) rose by an average of about 2 percent annually, causing food prices to decrease. "The percentage of U.S. disposable income spent on food prepared at home decreased, from 22 percent as late as 1950 to 7 percent by the end of the century."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/gardner.agriculture.us U.S. Agriculture in the Twentieth Century by Bruce Gardner, University of Maryland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928064328/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/gardner.agriculture.us |date=September 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kardex''' has been the name or part of the name of companies tracing back to '''Rand Ledger''' founded in 1898, which were closely associated with the development of the [[index card]] as a common business data storage device, and which were also associated with the entities that eventually became part of [[Unisys]].

Kardex as a company name was introduced in 1915, subsumed in 1927 (it remained as a brand name and a division name), and revived in 1978. It is currently borne by the '''Kardex Group''', based in [[Zurich, Switzerland]], which makes filing system components as well as many other products for handling materials and information, mostly in physical form.

The term '''kardex''' is also a common noun (a [[genericized trademark]]), particularly in the medical records field where it is synonymous with [[Medication Administration Record]],&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt; especially in Ireland and the United Kingdom.

==Separate Rand-led companies (1898-1925)==
{{main article|James Rand, Jr.}}

===Rand Ledger (1898-1925)===
American Ledger was founded by James H. Rand, Sr. in 1898. Rand had been a banker for many years and had come to see that existing index card systems used by clerks were inefficient. What was needed was a rationalized system using dividers, file tabs, and labels. Rand Sr. invented an improved filing system based on these concepts and founded the Rand Ledger Company to manufacture his index system,&lt;ref name=James_Rand_Jr_NYT_Obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ingham/&gt; called the Visible Ledger.&lt;ref name=AEC/&gt;

[[James Rand, Jr.]] joined his father's company after being graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1908 and ran it from 1910 through 1914. In 1915 the elder Rand re-assumed control of the company and Rand Jr., unable to reach agreement with his father on business matters, left.

===American Kardex (1915-1925)===
[[James Rand, Jr.]] formed his own filing and index supply company, American Kardex, in 1915. Within five years, American Kardex grew to be one of the leading office supply companies in the United States. It was roughly equal in revenues to Rand Ledger, and the two companies easily dominated the American office supply market. In 1920, American Kardex had more than $1 million in gross sales. The company's products were widely used in the health care field ("filling a kardex" became common nomenclature for entering data into a patient's medical record), and demand in Europe was so strong that Rand soon built a factory in Germany.

==Rand Kardex Bureau (1925-1927)==
As competition between American Kardex and Rand Ledger intensified, Mary Rand (James H. Rand, Sr.'s wife and James Rand, Jr.'s mother) brokered a reconciliation between father and son. In 1925, the two men agreed that American Kardex should purchase Rand Ledger. The new company, Rand Kardex, was the largest office supply company in the United States. James Rand, Sr. became the company chairman, while James Rand, Jr. was its president and general manager.

James Rand Jr. soon began expanding the company through acquisitions. He bought companies including Index Visible, Safe-Cabinet, Dalton Adding Machine, Baker-Vawter Ledger, and [[Library Bureau]], which was probably the first company to sell [[filing cabinet]]s commercially (in 1900) and may have invented them.&lt;ref name=Get_Organized_At_Home/&gt;&lt;ref name=Library_Bureau/&gt;

In its brief existence, the company was first known as Rand Kardex and then, after the acquisition of Library Bureau, as Rand Kardex Bureau.

==Remington Rand (1927-1955)==
{{main article|Remington Rand}}
[[File:Old_kardex_file_cabinet.jpg|thumb|right|Kardex [[visible file]] cabinets, 20th century]]
In 1886, E. Remington and Sons sold its typewriter business and the rights to the Remington name to the Standard Typewriter Manufacturing Company which in 1902 changed its name to Remington Typewriter Company.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt; In 1927 Rand Kardex merged with Remington Typewriter. The new company was called [[Remington Rand]], and Kardex was a division and brand of that company.

Remington Rand was led by James Rand Jr. for the duration of its independent existence. Company sales grew from $5 million in 1927 to $500 million in 1954, although market share suffered in the face of competition from [[IBM]].

Remington Rand purchased the [[Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation]] in 1950, delivered the [[UNIVAC I]] in 1951, and bought [[Engineering Research Associates]] in 1952, all this making them a major player in the new computer industry.

==Sperry Rand (1955-1978)==
{{main article|Sperry Rand}}
In 1955, [[Sperry Corporation]] acquired Remington Rand and renamed itself Sperry Rand. Remington Rand remained as a separate brand name and in the name of some divisions. The Remington Rand Systems division was concerned with filing systems and associated products such as file folders, and other material and physical data storage and handling systems, including Kardex.

In 1978 Sperry Rand decided to concentrate on the computer business, and sold a number of divisions including Remington Rand Systems. (Remington Rand Machines was also sold along with some other divisions, and the company dropped "Rand" from its title and reverted to Sperry Corporation; in 1986 they merged with [[Burroughs Corporation]] to form [[Unisys]].)

==Kardex Systems (1978-2008)==
The Remington Rand Systems division of Sperry Rand, now based in [[Marietta, Ohio]], was acquired by Aarque Management Corporation of [[Jamestown, New York]], and renamed to Kardex Systems to take advantage of Kardex's status as a long-famous brand in filing systems.&lt;ref name=Randex/&gt;&lt;ref name=Expo21XX/&gt;

In 2003 the company was sold to RACK Enterprises and Ronald Miller was made president.&lt;ref name=MHL/&gt;

Miller established a separate company, Randex, also selling filing and storage system components, for operation in Europe. Randex continued to exist as a separate company under Miller family control after Kardex Systems was sold to Remstar.&lt;ref name=Randex/&gt;

In 2008 Kardex Systems was acquired by Remstar [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] of [[Zurich, Switzerland]]. Remstar had been founded in 1977 (although what is now its Kardex Mlog division had been established in 1922 as Mehne [[GmbH]]) and its American subsidiary established in 1981 in [[Westbrook, Maine]].

==Kardex Group (2008- )==
[[File:USMC-110408-M-0151S-001.jpg|thumb|right|Kardex Remstar vertical storage carousel in use]]
In 2009, Kardex and Remstar's American operation, which had been established in 1981, were merged to form Kardex Remstar, based in Westbrook.

At some point{{when|date=March 2015}} Remstar AG was renamed to Kardex Group AG. {{Asof|2015}} Kardex Group consists of two divisions, Kardex Remstar and Kardex Mlog, Mlog having been acquired in 2010 and the Stow division having been spun off in 2013.

Kardex Remstar manufactures and sells materials handling systems for industry, and file handling systems for offices. Products include basic commodities such as file folders and labels as well as more complicated products such as shelving systems and cabinets, vertical lifts, and rack systems.&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek/&gt;

Kardex Mlog manufactures and sells automated high-bay warehouses and customized materials handling systems.

==Winter the dolphin==
{{main|Winter (dolphin)}}

In 2005, a baby [[dolphin]] (now named [[Winter (dolphin)|Winter]]) became entangled in the ropes of a crab trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lelis|first=Ludmilla|title=Winter the dolphin's rescue off Volusia has Hollywood ending|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-11-27/news/os-winter-dolphin-volusia-rescue-20101127_1_prosthetic-tail-baby-dolphin-rescue-truck|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rope cut off the supply of blood to her tail which resulted in her tail being amputated.&lt;ref name="Block"&gt;{{cite news|last=Block|first=Melissa|title=Researchers Hope to Give Dolphin Prosthetic Tail|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6147502|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was thought that Winter would learn to swim without a tail, but this forced her to swim with a "side to side" motion instead of the normal "up and down" motion. Winter's veterinarians feared that this unusual movement would damage her spine. Kevin Carroll, who had previously designed prosthetics for other animals (including dogs, an ostrich and a duck), volunteered to help after hearing about Winter on [[NPR]] and became Winter's prosthetist in 2005.&lt;ref name="Block"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pictured: The world's first bionic sea creature: Winter the dolphin gets a prosthetic tail|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-563966/Pictured-The-worlds-bionic-sea-creature-Winter-dolphin-gets-prosthetic-tail.html|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Teper |first=Shannon |title=Winter's Tail |url=http://www.highlightsteachers.com/teachers-toolbox/print-and-read-story/winters-tail |accessdate=3 January 2012 |newspaper=Highlights Teachers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302214226/http://www.highlightsteachers.com/teachers-toolbox/print-and-read-story/winters-tail |archivedate= 2 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barry|first=John|title=Winter's tale: Saving Winter|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/humaninterest/article927544.ece|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin and a team of experts, including Hanger clinician Dan Strzempka, began working on creating a prosthetic tail for Winter. While Carroll thought that it would be a simple task, the project took over a year and a half before Winter began wearing the tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aven|first=Daniel|title="Bionic" Dolphin Getting New Tail|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/08/08/earlyshow/contributors/debbyeturner/main3148359.shtml|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=CBS News|date=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successful creation of an artificial tail fluke is the first time a full prosthetic tail has been created for a dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziemba|first=Stan|title=First artificial tail for a dolphin leads to breakthrough for human amputees|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-10/news/0906080233_1_atlantic-bottlenose-dolphin-prosthetic-amputees|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll and Strzempka worked with a chemical engineer to develop WintersGel, a new material that would disperse pressure evenly onto the dolphin's skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Ellen|title=Tale behind the tail: true story of dolphin's second chance|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/tale-behind-the-tail-true-story-of-dolphins-second-chance-20111220-1p3qo.html|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now the material is used for human amputees including Brian Kolfage and Megan McKeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dolphin's new tail can help human amputees|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20415964/ns/health-health_care/t/dolphins-new-tail-can-help-human-amputees/#.TwKLlkres4J|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lloyd |first=Paula |title=Dolphin tail technology used to help Clovis girl |url=http://clovisindependent.com/2011/09/23/dolphin-tail-technology-used-to-help-clovis-girl/ |accessdate=3 January 2012 |newspaper=The Fresno Bee |date=23 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429132305/http://clovisindependent.com/2011/09/23/dolphin-tail-technology-used-to-help-clovis-girl/ |archivedate=29 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 book===
In 2009 Winter's story was told by [[Craig Hatkoff]] and his daughters Juliana and Isabella Hatkoff, the No. 1 [[New York Times]] best-selling children's authors in ''Winter's Tail: How One Little Dolphin Learned to Swim Again''. The book was published by Turtle Pond Publications and [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]. The book was co-released with a [[Nintendo DS]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding 'Teachable Moments' In Animal Tales|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/11/28/131647866/father-daughter-tell-story-of-leo-the-lost-leopard|work=All Things Considered|publisher=NPR|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lodge|first=Sally|title=Scholastic's 'Winter's Tail' Makes Waves|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/41320-scholastic--s--winter--s-tail--makes-waves.html|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|date=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 film===
{{main|Dolphin Tale}}

In 2011, [[Winter (dolphin)|Winter]]'s story hit the big screen when American film director [[Charles Martin Smith]] directed the film ''[[Dolphin Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolphin Tale|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1564349/|work=IMDB|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll and Strzempka served as consultants for the movie and are featured at the end credits along with Megan McKeon and others who have benefited from Winter. For reasons unknown concerning the historical liberties, Carroll and Strzempka's roles were merged into one character for the film, Dr. Cameron McCarthy who is played by actor [[Morgan Freeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smoot|first=Cynthia|title=Birds, broken limbs, and second chances|url=http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/dpp/news/local/pinellas/giving-animals-with-broken-limbs-a-second-chance-12052011|accessdate=7 January 2012|newspaper=My Fox Tampa Bay|date=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Blu-ray]] + DVD + [[UltraViolet (system)|UltraViolet]] Digital Copy version of the movie, Carroll and Strzempka are featured in Winter's Inspiration, the featurette that shares Winter's true story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonanno|first=Luke|title=Dolphin Tale: Blu-ray + DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy Review|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/dolphintale.html|work=DVDizzy.com|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warren Macdonald==
In 1997 [[Warren Macdonald]], an Australian mountain climber, was climbing through a remote mountainside in Australia when a one-ton boulder fell onto his legs trapping him for 45 hours. This trauma resulted in both of his legs being amputated mid-thigh. After his rehabilitation, he returned to climbing using speciality climbing prostheses developed by Kevin Carroll and [[Hanger, Inc.|Hanger]] clinician Chad Simpson. In 2003 Macdonald climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in Tanzania, making him the first bilateral transfemoral amputee to accomplish such a feat.&lt;ref name="Mahr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=Warren|title=A Test of Will: One Man's Extraordinary Story of Survival|year=2004|publisher=D&amp;M Publishers Inc.|location=Vancouver|isbn=1-55365-064-6|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanfield|first=Morgan|title=Warren Macdonald: Indomitable Will|url=http://www.oandp.com/articles/2009-06_07.asp|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=The O&amp;P Edge|date=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7504">'''Memory dependence prediction''' is a technique, employed by high-performance [[out-of-order execution]] [[microprocessor]]s that execute [[primary storage|memory]] access operations (loads and stores) out of program order, to predict true dependencies between loads and stores at [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]] [[execution (computers)|execution]] time. With the predicted dependence information, the processor can then decide to [[speculative execution|speculatively execute]] certain loads and stores out of order, while preventing other loads and stores from executing out-of-order (keeping them in-order). Later in the [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]], [[memory disambiguation]] techniques are used to determine if the loads and stores were correctly executed and, if not, to recover.

By using the memory dependence predictor to keep most dependent loads and stores in order, the processor gains the benefits of aggressive out-of-order load/store execution but avoids many of the memory dependence violations that occur when loads and stores were incorrectly executed. This increases performance because it reduces the number of [[pipeline flush]]es that are required to recover from these memory dependence violations. See the [[memory disambiguation]] article for more information on memory dependencies, memory dependence violations, and recovery.

In general, memory dependence prediction predicts whether two memory operations are dependent, that is, if they interact by accessing the same memory location. Besides using store to load (RAW or true) memory dependence prediction for the out-of-order scheduling of loads and stores, other applications of memory dependence prediction have been proposed. See for example.&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP"&gt;Streamlining Inter-Operation Memory Communication via Memory Dependence Prediction, Moshovos and Sohi, in the Proceedings of the Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture, Dec. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Memory dependence prediction is an optimization on top of '''memory dependence speculation'''. Sequential execution semantics imply that stores and loads appear to execute in the order specified by the program. However, as with out-of-order execution of other instructions, it may be possible to execute two memory operations in a different from the program implied order. This is possible when the two operations are independent. In memory dependence speculation a load may be allowed to execute before a store that precedes it. Speculation succeeds when the load is independent of the store, that is, when the two instructions access different memory locations. Speculation fails when the load is dependent upon the store, that is, when the two accesses overlap in memory. In the first, modern out-of-order designs, memory speculation was not used as its benefits were limited. Αs the scope of the out-of-order execution increased over few tens of instructions, naive memory dependence speculation was used. In '''naive memory dependence speculation''',&lt;ref name="SaSoMD"&gt;Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization of Memory Dependences, Moshovos, Breach, Vijaykumar and Sohi, in the Proceedings of the 24th Annual ACM/IEEE Conference on Computer Architecture, June 1997. Also as technical report, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin–Madison, March 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; a load is allowed to bypass any preceding store. As with any form of speculation, it is important to weight the benefits of correct speculation against the penalty paid on incorrect speculation. As the scope of out-of-order execution increases further into several tens of instructions, the performance benefits of naive speculation decrease. To retain the benefits of aggressive memory dependence speculation while avoiding the costs of mispeculation several predictors have been proposed.

'''Selective memory dependence prediction'''&lt;ref name="SaSoMD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MDP"&gt;Memory Dependence Prediction, Moshovos, Ph.D. Thesis, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Dec. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; stalls specific loads until it is certain that no violation may occur. It does not explicitly predict dependencies. This predictor may delay loads longer than necessary and hence result in suboptimal performance. In fact, in some cases it performs worse than naively speculating all loads as early as possible. This is because often its faster to mispeculate and recover than to wait for all preceding stores to execute. Exact memory dependence prediction was developed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Specifically, '''Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization'''&lt;ref name="SaSoMD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MDP" /&gt; delays loads only as long as it is necessary by predicting the exact store a load should wait for. This predictor predicts exact dependences (store and load pair). The '''synonym predictor'''&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP" /&gt; groups together all dependences that share a common load or store instruction. The '''store sets'''&lt;ref&gt;Memory Dependence Prediction using Store Sets, Chrysos and Emer, in the Proceedings of the 25th Annual ACM/IEEE Conference on Computer Architecture, June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; predictor represents multiple potential dependences efficiently by grouping together all possible stores a load may dependent upon. The '''store barrier'''&lt;ref&gt;Apparatus to dynamically control the out-of-order execution of load-store instructions in a processor capable of dispatching, issuing and executing multiple instructions in a single processor cycle, Hesson, LeBlanc and Ciavaglia, IBM, US Patent 5,615,350, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; predictor treats certain store instructions as barriers. That is, all subsequent load or store operations are not allowed to bypass the specific store. The store barrier predictor does not explicitly predict dependencies. This predictor may unnecessarily delay subsequent, yet independent loads. Memory dependence prediction has other applications beyond the scheduling of loads and stores. For example, '''speculative memory cloaking'''&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP" /&gt; and '''speculative memory bypassing'''&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP" /&gt; use memory dependence prediction to streamline the communication of values through memory.

==Analogy to branch prediction==
Memory dependence prediction for loads and stores is analogous to [[branch predictor|branch prediction]] for [[conditional branch]] instructions. In branch prediction, the branch predictor predicts which way the branch will resolve before it is known. The processor can then speculatively fetch and execute instructions down one of the paths of the branch. Later, when the branch instruction executes, it can be determined if the branch instruction was correctly predicted. If not, this is a [[misprediction|branch misprediction]], and a pipeline flush is necessary to throw away instructions that were speculatively fetched and executed.

Branch prediction can be thought of as a two step process. First, the predictor determines the direction of the branch (taken or not). This is a binary decision. Then, the predictor determines the actual target address. Similarly, memory dependence prediction can be thought of as a two step process. First, the predictor determines whether there is a dependence. Then it determines which this dependence is.

'''Mobitex''' is an [[OSI model|OSI]] based [[open standard]], national public access [[WWAN|wireless]] packet-switched data network. Mobitex puts great emphasis on safety and reliability with its use by military, police, firefighters and ambulance services. It was developed in the beginning of the 1980s by the Swedish [[Televerket (Sweden)|Televerket]] Radio. From 1988 the development took place in Eritel, a joint-venture between [[Ericsson]] and Televerket, later on as an Ericsson subsidiary. Mobitex became operational in Sweden in 1986.

In the mid-1990s Mobitex gained consumer popularity by providing [[two-way communication|two-way]] [[paging (telecommunications)|paging network]] services.  It was the first wireless network to provide always on, wireless [[push email]] services such as [[RadioMail]] and [[Inter@ctive Paging]].  It is also used by the first model of [[Research in Motion|Research in Motion's]] [[BlackBerry]], and [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] such as the [[Palm VII]].  During [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] and the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 hurricane]] rescue and clean-up operations, Mobitex proved itself to be a very reliable and useful system for first responders.

Mobitex is a [[packet-switched]], [[narrowband]], data-only technology mainly for short burst data.  Mobitex channels are 12.5&amp;nbsp;kHz wide. In North America, Mobitex ran at {{nowrap|900 MHz}}, while in Europe it uses {{nowrap|400 - 450 MHz}}. The [[modulation]] scheme used is [[Minimum-shift keying#Gaussian minimum-shift keying|GMSK]] with a [[ALOHAnet|slotted aloha]] [[communications protocol|protocol]] at {{nowrap|8000 bit/s}}, although user throughput is typically around half of that.

The network provided the first public access wireless data communication services in North America.  Subscriber services included electronic messaging with [[carbon copy|Cc]] capabilities to multiple recipients, combined with the ability to log on to any wireless or fixed terminal and receive stored mailbox messages.

Mobitex is offered on over 30 networks on five continents. In Canada it was first introduced in 1990 by [[Rogers Communications|Rogers]] [[rogers wireless|Cantel]], and in 1991 by [[common carrier|carrier]] [[RAM Mobile Data]]. However, {{As of|2018|lc=on}}, it is primarily used in Belgium, the Netherlands and China. European Mobitex networks almost completely withered in the shadow of the overwhelming success of [[GSM]] there in the early 1990s.

Mobitex networks in North America were marketed under several names, including RAM Mobile Data, [[BellSouth]] Wireless Data, [[Cingular]] Interactive, [[Cingular]] Wireless and [[Velocita Wireless]], and [[Rogers Wireless]] in Canada. 

Mobitex in the UK was marketed by RAM Mobile Data, the UK part of which became Transcomm and was then purchased by [[BT Group|BT]] (British Telecom) in 2004. The largest use of Mobitex in the United Kingdom was within the vehicle recovery business. Nearly all breakdowns passed to UK breakdown service agents were sent using [[Turbo Dispatch]], a Mobitex-based gateway software developed in the early nineties by Ian Lane and Andy Lambert. 

Despite the competitive nature of the vehicle recovery market in the UK, motoring organisations were persuaded to co-operate and make a standard of the format. This resulted in a major saving for the eight hundred independent garages used by the motoring organisations. The Turbo Dispatch Standards Group (the official keepers of the standard) estimated that at least twenty million breakdowns and recoveries were transmitted over Turbo Dispatch each year. 

In Sweden the Mobitex network was finally shut down permanently on December 31st 2012 after 25 years.

'''Netbook''' is a generic name given to a category of small, lightweight, [[Legacy-free PC|legacy-free]], and inexpensive [[laptop]] computers that were introduced in 2007. Netbooks compete in the same market segment as [[Mobile device|mobiles]] and [[Chromebook]]s (a variation on the portable [[network computer]]).

At their inception in late 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.computerworld.com/what_was_the_first_netbook ''ComputerWorld'', "What was the first netbook?" May 11, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; as smaller notebooks optimized for low weight and low cost&lt;ref name="btwsj"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cheap PCs Weigh on Microsoft |series=Business Technologies blog |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=December 8, 2008 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/biztech/2008/12/08/cheap-pcs-weigh-on-microsoft/}}&lt;/ref&gt;—netbooks omitted certain features (e.g., the [[optical drive]]), featured smaller screens and keyboards, and offered reduced computing power when compared to a full-sized laptop. Over the course of their evolution, netbooks have ranged in size from below 5" screen diagonal to 12". A typical weight is {{nowrap|1 kg}} ({{nowrap|2.2 pounds}}). Often significantly less expensive than other [[laptop]]s,&lt;ref name="pricegrabber"&gt;{{cite book |title=Netbook Trends and Solid-State Technology Forecast |publisher=pricegrabber.com |page=7 |format=PDF |url=https://mr.pricegrabber.com/Netbook_Trends_and_SolidState_Technology_January_2009_CBR.pdf |accessdate=2009-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226214405/https://mr.pricegrabber.com/Netbook_Trends_and_SolidState_Technology_January_2009_CBR.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-26 |df= }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; by mid-2009, netbooks began to be offered by some wireless data carriers to their users "[[Gratis versus libre|free of charge]]", with an extended service contract purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Light and Cheap, Netbooks Are Poised to Reshape PC Industry |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 1, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/02/technology/02netbooks.html |quote="AT&amp;T announced on Tuesday that customers in Atlanta could get a type of compact PC called a netbook for just 50 US$ if they signed up for an Internet service plan..."—“The era of a perfect Internet computer for 99 US$ is coming this year,” said Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, a maker of PC graphics chips that is trying to adapt to the new technological order. |first1=Ashlee |last1=Vance |first2=Matt |last2=Richtel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the short period since their appearance, netbooks grew in size and features, and converged with smaller, lighter laptops and [[subnotebook]]s. By August 2009, when comparing a [[Dell]] netbook to a Dell notebook, [[CNET]] called netbooks "nothing more than smaller, cheaper notebooks", noting, "the specs are so similar that the average shopper would likely be confused as to why one is better than the other", and "the only conclusion is that there really is no distinction between the devices".&lt;ref name="cnnogg"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ogg |first=Erica |title=Time to drop the Netbook label |publisher=[[Cable News Network|CNN]] |date=August 20, 2009 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/ptech/08/20/cnet.drop.netbook.label/index.html |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to prevent cannibalizing the more lucrative laptops in their lineup, manufacturers imposed several constraints on netbooks; however this would soon push netbooks into a niche where they had few distinctive advantages over traditional laptops or tablet computers (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Arthur |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/31/netbooks-dead-2013 |title=Sayonara, netbooks: Asus (and the rest) won't make any more in 2013 |publisher=The Guardian |date=2012-12-31|accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, the increasing popularity of [[tablet computer]]s (particularly the [[iPad]])—a different form factor, but with improved computing capabilities and lower production cost—had led to a decline in netbook sales.&lt;ref name=forbes-2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Caulfield|first=Brian|title=The NetBook Is Dead, The iPad Killed It, Don't Buy One|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/briancaulfield/2011/11/28/the-netbook-is-dead-the-ipad-killed-it-dont-buy-one/|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=20 June 2012|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the high end of the performance spectrum, [[ultrabook]]s, ultra-light portables with a traditional keyboard and display have been revolutionized by the 11.6-inch [[MacBook Air]], which made fewer performance sacrifices albeit at considerably higher production cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/laptops/apple-macbook-air-11/4505-3121_7-35330105.html Apple MacBook Air review (11-inch, Summer 2012)], "Remember Netbooks and ultraportable laptops? Those 10- and 11-inchers were all the rage a few years ago, but thanks to the rise of larger-screened Ultrabook laptops and smaller-screened tablets, they've been disappearing from the computer landscape. One significant 11-incher still remains: the 11-inch MacBook Air. When it debuted in late 2010, it was the answer to the Netbook Generation. Now it stands alone, not only as a speedy ultraportable, but as one of the few 11-inch Ultrabook-class laptops around. The closest Windows equivalent we've reviewed recently, the Dell XPS 13, is larger and heavier."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/mac/life-with-the-macbook-air-the-netbook-ive-been-waiting-for/919 Life with the MacBook Air: The netbook I've been waiting for], [[TechRepublic]]&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalizing on the success of the MacBook Air,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2397811,00.asp MacBook Air vs. Ultrabooks], ''[[PC Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and in response to it, Intel promoted [[Ultrabook]] as a new high-mobility standard, which has been hailed by some analysts as succeeding where netbooks failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Mobile-and-Wireless/Ultrabooks-Will-Succeed-Where-Netbooks-Failed-10-Reasons-Why-797300/ Enterprise Mobility: Ultrabooks Will Succeed Where Netbooks Failed: 10 Reasons Why], ''[[eWeek]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/261145/the_ultrabook_revolution.html The Ultrabook Revolution], ''[[PC World]]'',  Aug 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dvorak/&gt; As a result of these two developments, netbooks of 2011 had kept price as their only strong point, losing in the design, ease-of-use and portability department to tablets (and tablets with removable keyboards) and to Ultrabook laptops in the features and performance field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/laptops/ipad-vs-ultrabook-vs-netbook-which-is-right-for-you-50006300/ iPad vs ultrabook vs netbook: Which is right for you?], [[CNET UK]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many major netbook producing companies stopped producing them by the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/31/netbooks-dead-2013 Asus (and the rest) won't make any more in 2013]. [[The Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt; Many netbook products were replaced on the market by [[Chromebook]]s, a variation on the [[network computer]] concept in the form of a netbook. HP re-entered the non-Chromebook netbook market with the ''Stream 11'' in 2014.&lt;ref name=Ars-2014-12-06&gt;{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/12/chromebook-in-the-streets-windows-in-the-sheets-hps-200-stream-11-reviewed/ |title= Don’t call it a netbook (or a "Chromebook killer")—HP’s $200 Stream 11 reviewed |publisher= Ars Technica |author= Andrew Cunningham |date= 6 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:ASUS Eee White Alt.jpg|thumb|An [[Asus Eee PC]] 700, the first mass-produced netbook, which used a 7-inch screen.]]
The origins of the netbook can be traced to the highly popular Toshiba range of [[Toshiba Libretto|Libretto sub-notebooks]]. The 6" Libretto 20 dates back to early 1996 and weighed only 840g.  Apple also had a line of PowerBook Duos that were ultra-portable Macintosh laptops in the mid 90s. More recently, [[Psion (computers)|Psion]]'s now-discontinued [[Psion netBook|netBook]] line, the [[OLPC XO-1]] (initially called US$100 laptop) and the [[Palm Foleo]] were all small, portable, network-enabled computers.&lt;ref name="PCMag1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bajarin |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Bajarin |title=Jeff Hawkins and the World's First Netbook |work=PC Magazine |date=November 21, 2008|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335072,00.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCMag2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technewsworld.com/story/31758.html?wlc=1235434538 Psion's NetBook Pro Abandons EPOC in Favor of Windows CE].&lt;/ref&gt; The generic use of the term "netbook", however, began in 2007 when [[Asus]] unveiled the [[Asus Eee PC]]. Originally designed for emerging markets, the {{convert|23|x|17|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} device weighed about {{convert|0.9|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and featured a {{convert|7|in|cm|abbr=on}} display, a keyboard approximately 85% the size of a normal keyboard, a [[solid-state drive]] and a custom version of [[Linux]] with a simplified [[Graphical user interface|user interface]] geared towards netbook use.&lt;ref name="PCMag2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bajarin |first=Tim |title=Netbooks vs. Notebooks |work= PCMagazine |date=September 12, 2008 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2330274,00.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Eee PC, [[Everex]] launched its Linux-based [[CloudBook]]; [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Vista]] models were also introduced and [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] released the [[MSI Wind Netbook|Wind]]&amp;mdash;others soon followed suit.

The [[OLPC]] project followed the same market goals laid down by the [[eMate 300]] eight years earlier.&lt;ref name="MacWorld"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edwards |first=Benj |title=The Forgotten eMate 300 -- 15 years later |work= MacWorld |date=December 21, 2012 |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/2020270/the-forgotten-emate-300-15-years-later.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eMate300documentation"&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple eMate 300 Quick Fact Sheet |work= Apple |date=1996 |url=https://msu.edu/~luckie/gallery/emate300.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known for its innovation in producing a durable, cost- and power-efficient netbook for [[developing countries]], it is regarded as one of the major factors that led more top computer hardware manufacturers to begin creating low-cost netbooks for the consumer market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcplus.techradar.com/node/3257 OLPC: The History Of One Laptop Per Child]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117185323/http://pcplus.techradar.com/node/3257 |date=2011-11-17 }}, techradar.com&lt;/ref&gt; When the first Asus Eee PC sold over 300,000 units in four months, companies such as [[Dell]] and [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] took note and began producing their own inexpensive netbooks. And while the [[OLPC XO-1]] targets a different audience than do the other manufacturers' netbooks, it appears that [[OLPC]] is now facing competition. Developing countries now have a large choice of vendors, from which they can choose which low-cost netbook they prefer.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer et al.: "One Laptop Per Child: Vision vs. Reality", ''Communications of the ACM'', June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 2008, netbooks had begun to take [[market share]] away from [[Laptop|notebooks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/10/04/1827200 |title="Netbooks" Move Up In Notebook Rankings |accessdate=2008-10-23 |author=Ian Lamont |date=2008-10-04 |work=Slashdot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to earlier, largely failed attempts to establish mini computers as a new class of mainstream personal computing devices built around comparatively expensive platforms requiring proprietary software applications or imposing severe usability limitations, the recent success of netbooks can also be attributed to the fact that PC technology has now matured enough to allow truly cost optimized implementations with enough performance to suit the needs of a majority of PC users. This is illustrated by the fact that typical system performance of a netbook is on the level of a mainstream PC in 2001, at around one quarter of the cost. While this performance level suffices for most of the user needs, it caused an increased interest in resource-efficient applications such as [[Google]]'s [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], and forced [[Microsoft]] to extend availability of Windows XP to secure market share. It is estimated that almost thirty times more netbooks were sold in 2008 (11.4 million, 70% of which were in Europe)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umpcportal.com/2008/11/70-of-netbook-sales-are-in-europe 70% of Netbook sales are in Europe].&lt;/ref&gt; than in 2007 (400,000).&lt;ref name="ee2009-01-10"&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212701251 Analysis: Did Intel underestimate netbook success?]&lt;/ref&gt; This trend is reinforced by the rise of [[web-based application]]s as well as [[Cellular network|mobile networking]] and, according to [[Wired Magazine]], netbooks are evolving into "super-portable laptops for professionals".&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2009/01/cheap-netbooks.html Puny, Trendy Netbooks Are Growing Up to Suit Business Users]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|ongoing recession]] is also helping with the growing sales of netbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liliputing.com/tag/economy |title=economy |publisher=Liliputing |date= |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the [[New South Wales]] [[Department of Education and Training (New South Wales)|Department of Education and Training]], in partnership with [[Lenovo]], provided Year 9 (high school) students in government high schools with Lenovo S10e netbooks in 2009, Lenovo Mini 10 netbooks in 2010, Lenovo Edge 11 netbooks in 2011 and a modified Lenovo X130e netbook in 2012, each preloaded with software including [[Microsoft Office]] and [[Adobe Systems]]' Creative Suite 4. These were provided under Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]]'s Digital Education Revolution, or DER. The netbooks ran [[Windows 7 Enterprise]]. These netbooks were secured with Computrace Lojack for laptops that the police can use to track the device if it is lost or stolen. The NSW DET retains ownership of these netbooks until the student graduates from Year 12, when the student can keep it. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago&amp;mdash;Prime Minister Kamla Persad Bisseser&amp;mdash;is also providing HP laptops to form 1 Students (11-year-olds) with the same police trackable software as above.

[[Greece]] provided all 13-year-old students (middle school, or ''[[Gymnasium (school)#Countries with gymnasium schools|gymnasium]]'', freshmen) and their teachers with netbooks in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalaid.gr/defaulteng.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531183644/http://www.digitalaid.gr/defaulteng.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-05-31 |title=Digital Aid S.A |publisher=Digitalaid.gr |date= |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the "Digital Classroom Initiative". Students were given one unique coupon each, with which they redeemed the netbook of their choice, up to a €450 price ceiling, in participating shops throughout the country. These netbooks came bundled with localised versions of either [[Windows XP]] (or higher) or [[Open-source software|open source]] (e.g. [[Linux]]) operating systems, wired and wireless networking functionality, antivirus protection, preactivated parental controls, and an educational software package.

[[Microsoft]] and [[Intel]] have tried to "cement" netbooks in the low end of the market to protect mainstream notebook PC sales, because they get lower margins on low-cost models. The companies have limited the specifications of netbooks, but despite this [[original equipment manufacturer]]s have announced higher-end netbooks models as of March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lai |first=Eric |title=Intel, Microsoft look away as beefed-up netbooks blur lines with notebook PCs |work=[[Computerworld]] |date=2009-03-30 |url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9130757 |accessdate=2011-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302144543/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic |archivedate=2007-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ending in 2008 the report was that the typical netbook featured a {{convert|1.4|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} weight, a {{convert|9|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} screen, wireless Internet connectivity, [[Linux]] or [[Windows XP]], an [[Intel Atom]] processor, and a cost of less than $400 US.&lt;ref name="fortune"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fortt |first=Jon |title=Tech's hope in 2009 - or curse? |work=Fortune |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/24/technology/fortt_netbooks.fortune/index.htm |date=2008-12-24 |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mid-2009 newspaper article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2009579304_ptmacc01.html |work=Seattle Times |title=Netbooks' price, size make them a worthy Apple rival |first=Glenn |last=Fleishman |date=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that a typical netbook is {{convert|1.2|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}, $300 US, and has a {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} screen,
{{nowrap|1 GB}} of [[random-access memory]], a {{nowrap|160 GB}} [[hard disk drive]], and a wireless transceiver for both home and a mobile network. Buyers drove the netbook market towards larger screens, which grew from {{convert|7|in|cm|abbr=on}} in the original [[Asus Eee PC]] 700 to {{convert|12|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} models in the summer of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asus.com/product.aspx?P_ID=LUiLXJyf53i17Dmh Eee PC 1008HA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having peaked at about 20% of the portable computer market, netbooks started to slightly lose market share (within the category) in early 2010, coinciding with the appearance and success of the [[iPad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-20007756-64.html Apple's iPad nabs Netbook market share]&lt;/ref&gt; Technology commentator Ross Rubin argued two and a half years later in [[Engadget]] that "Netbooks never got any respect.  While Steve Jobs rebuked the netbook at the iPad's introduction, the iPad owes a bit of debt to the little laptops. The netbook demonstrated the potential of an inexpensive, portable second computing device, with a screen size of about 10 inches, intended primarily for [[media consumption]] and light productivity."&lt;ref name=rubin&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2012/07/08/the-netbook-legacy/ Switched On: The Netbook Legacy] By Ross Rubin, Jul 8th 2012, [[Engadget]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although some manufacturers directly blamed competition from the iPad, some analysts pointed out that larger, fully fledged laptops had entered the price range of netbooks at about the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399496,00.asp Are Netbooks Finally Dead?] by Tim Bajarin, January 30, 2012 '[[PC Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11.6-inch [[MacBook Air]], introduced in late 2010, compared favorably to many netbooks in terms of processing power but also ergonomics, at 2.3 pounds being lighter than some 10-inch netbooks, owing in part to the integration of the flash storage chips on the main logic board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laptopmag.com/review/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-air-11-inch-2010.aspx Apple 11-inch MacBook Air Review], by Mark Spoonauer on October 21, 2010, Laptopmag.&lt;/ref&gt; It was described as a superlative netbook (or at least as what a netbook should be) by several technology commentators,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2010/10/macbook-air-my-new-favourite-netbook/MacBook Air – my new favourite netbook] by Chris Nuttall, ''[[Financial Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cn1/&gt;&lt;ref name=benz/&gt; even though Apple has never referred to it as such, sometimes describing it—in the words of [[Steve Jobs]]—as "the third kind of notebook."&lt;ref name=cn1&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-31012_7-20021071-10355804.html MacBook Air a great Windows Netbook, for a price], [[CNET]]&lt;/ref&gt; The entry level model had a MSRP of $999,&lt;ref name=cn1/&gt; costing significantly more than the average netbook, as much as three or four times more.&lt;ref name=rubin/&gt;

With the introduction of [[Chromebook]]s, major manufacturers produced the new laptops for the same segment of the market that netbooks serviced. Chromebooks, a variation on the [[network computer]] concept, in the form of a netbook, require internet connections for full functionality. Chromebooks became top selling laptops in 2014. The threat of Google Chrome OS based Chromebooks prompted Microsoft to revive and revamp netbooks with ''Windows 8.1 with Bing''. HP re-entered the non-Chromebook netbook market with the ''Stream 11'' in 2014.&lt;ref name=Ars-2014-12-06/&gt;

== Trademarks ==
[[File:OLPC XO next to a Psion Netbook 2.jpg|thumb|[[Psion netBook]]]]
In 1996 [[Psion (computers)|Psion]] started applying for trademarks for a line of ''netBook'' products that was later released in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/release?id=16302 Psion netbook news release].  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608191451/http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/release?id=16302 |date=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International trademarks were issued (including {{US trademark|75215401}} and {{Community trademark|000428250}}) but the models failed to gain popularity&lt;ref name="arstechnica.com"&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2009/02/save-the-netbooks-fighting-a-trademark-on-extinct-hardware.ars Save the Netbooks: fighting a trademark on extinct hardware]&lt;/ref&gt; and are now discontinued (except for providing accessories, maintenance and support to existing users).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psionteklogix.com/Public.aspx?s=us&amp;p=EOLProducts Psion Teklogix Discontinued Products].  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517090710/http://www.psionteklogix.com/public.aspx?s=us&amp;p=EOLProducts |date=2007-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar marks were recently rejected by the [[USPTO]] citing a "likelihood of confusion" under section 2(d).&lt;ref&gt;{{US trademark|77527311}} for 'G NETBOOK' rejected 31 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US trademark|77580272}} for [[Micro-Star International|MSI]]'s 'WIND NETBOOK'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US trademark|77590174}} for [[Coby Electronics Corporation|Coby Electronics]]' 'COBY NETBOOK' rejected 13 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; prompting the formation of the "Save the Netbooks" [[grassroots]] campaign which worked to reverse the [[Google AdWords]] ban, cancel the trademark and encourage continued generic use of the term.&lt;ref name="arstechnica.com"/&gt; While preparing a "Petition for Cancellation" of {{US trademark|75215401}} they revealed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/247933/dell-accuses-psion-of-fraud-over-netbook-claims.html Dell accuses Psion of "fraud" over netbook claims].&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Dell]] had submitted one day before&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2009/02/dell-fights-back-against-psion-netbook-trademark-rampage.ars Dell fights back against Psion netBook trademark rampage].&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of abandonment, [[genericized trademark|genericness]] and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crn.com/mobile/214502133 Dell Goes 'Nuclear' Over Netbook Trademark].  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223171727/http://www.crn.com/mobile/214502133 |date=2009-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They later revealed Psion's counter-suit against [[Intel]], filed on 27 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.savethenetbooks.com/2009/03/newsflash-intel-counter-sued-by-psion.html Newsflash: Intel counter-sued by Psion in "netbook" trademark lawsuit; jury trial demanded] [[Save the Netbooks]].  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303165628/http://blog.savethenetbooks.com/2009/03/newsflash-intel-counter-sued-by-psion.html |date=2009-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also revealed around the same time that Intel had also sued Psion Teklogix (US &amp; Canada) and Psion (UK) in the Federal Court on similar grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/02/16/Intel_Wants_Netbook_Trademark_Canceled.htm Intel Wants 'Netbook' Trademark Canceled].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to seeking cancellation of the trademark, Intel sought an order enjoining Psion from asserting any trademark rights in the term "netbook", a declarative judgment regarding their use of the term, attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements and "such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/02/16/IntelvPsion.pdf Complaint for Injunctive Relief, Declaratory Judgment &amp; Cancellation of Federal Trademark].&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2009, Psion announced that the suit had been settled out of court. Psion's statement said that the company was withdrawing all of its trademark registrations for the term "Netbook" and that Psion agreed to "waive all its rights against third parties in respect of past, current or future use" of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10253210-92.html Psion, Intel settle 'Netbook' trademark dispute].&lt;/ref&gt;

Netbooks typically have less powerful hardware than larger laptop computers and do not include an [[optical disc drive]] that larger laptops often have. Some netbooks do not even have a conventional [[hard disk drive|hard drive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-10063963-33.html What is a Netbook computer?]&lt;/ref&gt; Such netbooks use [[Solid-state drive|solid-state]] storage devices instead, as these require less power, are faster, lighter, and generally more shock-resistant, but with much less storage capacity (such as 32, 64, or 128 GB compared to the 100 GB to 2 TB mechanical hard drives typical of many notebooks/laptop computers).

They include more than one USB port, because one of them is usually devoted to the wireless keyboard and mouse set. This wireless keyboard could not include the [[numeric keypad]]

All netbooks on the market today support [[Wi-Fi]] [[wireless networking]] and many can be used on [[mobile network|mobile telephone networks]] with data capability (for example, [[3G]]).  Mobile data plans are supplied under contract in the same way as mobile telephones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/12/next-time-you-s.html |title=The Next Netbook Trend: Cellphone-Like Contract Deals |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|first=Priya|last=Ganapati|date=2008-12-15 |accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also include [[Ethernet over twisted pair|ethernet]] and/or [[modem]] ports, for [[broadband]] or [[dial-up Internet access]], respectively.

It remains to be seen whether Intel's new silvermont architecture, released in 2013, will revive sales as new chips will offer far greater power using the same wattage.

=== Processor architectures ===

====x86====
Most netbooks, such as those from [[Asus]], [[BenQ]], [[Dell]], [[Toshiba]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] use the [[Intel Atom]] notebook processor (typically the N270 1.6&amp;nbsp;GHz but also available is the N280 at 1.66&amp;nbsp;GHz, replaced by the N450 series with graphics and memory controller integrated on the chip in early 2010 and running at 1.66&amp;nbsp;GHz), but the x86-compatible [[VIA Technologies]] [[VIA C7|C7]] processor is also powering netbooks from many different manufacturers like [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-9914927-64.html |title=Why HP chose Via chip over Intel for Mini-Note |first=Brooke |last=Crothers |work=[[CNET News]] |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samsung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.electronista.com/articles/09/04/03/samsung.nc20.now.available/ |title=Samsung's VIA-powered NC20 netbook now available |publisher=Electronista |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; VIA has also designed the [[VIA Nano|Nano]], a new [[x86-64]]-compatible architecture targeting lower priced, mobile applications like netbooks. Currently, one netbook uses the Nano; the [[Samsung NC20]]. Some very low cost netbooks use a [[system-on-a-chip]] [[Vortex86]] processor meant for [[embedded system]]s, just to be "Windows compatible", but with very low performance. In 2011, [[AMD]] launched [[AMD Fusion|Fusion]] netbook processors which are included in [[Asus Eee PC]] 1015T and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=mehboob |title=AMD plans to launch Netbooks Processors next year |work=Processor Discussions  |publisher=smartbooktalk.com |date=2010-03-12 |url= http://www.smartbooktalk.com/processor-discussions-f36/amd-plans-to-launch-netbooks-processors-next-year-t174.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110609052416/http://www.smartbooktalk.com/processor-discussions-f36/amd-plans-to-launch-netbooks-processors-next-year-t174.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2011-06-09 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=AMD to Introduce Netbook Chip in 2011 |work=Hardware Central |publisher=[[internet.com]] |date=2010-03-10 |url=http://www.hardwarecentral.com/news/article.php/3869796 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not officially sanctioned by AMD for this role, a 1.2&amp;nbsp;GHz [[Athlon 64]] model L110 processor, dissipating 13&amp;nbsp;W, was used by at least one company—[[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]]—to power an 11.6-inch portable (1366x768 screen resolution), described as a netbook by the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/167425/acer_pushes_amd_into_netbook_space.html Acer Pushes AMD Into Netbook Space], ''[[PC World]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Launched in mid-2009 at $399 in the United States, the [[Gateway LT3103U|LT31]] met with reviewers' approval for its performance, being generally recognized as faster than contemporary Atom-based products in the same price range, while having a considerably shorter battery life and still falling short of Intel's [[CULV#Based on Intel Core 2 architecture|Core 2 ULV]] product line powering more expensive small-factor offerings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/laptops/gateway-lt3103u/4505-3121_7-33721171.html Gateway LT3103u review], [[CNET]]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laptopmag.com/review/laptops/gateway-lt3103u.aspx Gateway LT3103u Review] by Michael A.

The 11.6 inch MacBook Air debuted in late 2010 with a 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz Core 2 Duo processor (a 10&amp;nbsp;W part) and a 1366x768 display resolution for its entry level model priced at $999 (with 1.6&amp;nbsp;GHz available as upgrade), which put it "much closer to a fully modern laptop than the small-but-crippled netbooks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Mingis |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9193382/Apple_s_new_11.6_in._MacBook_Air_Don_t_call_it_a_netbook |title=Apple's new 11.6-in. MacBook Air: Don't call it a netbook |publisher=Computerworld |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer described it as the "Mercedes Benz of netbooks".&lt;ref name=benz&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/macbook-air-11-inch-what-a-netbook-should-look-like/41476 MacBook Air 11-inch: What a netbook should look like], [[ZDNet]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 2011 ''[[PC Magazine]]'' buyer's guide for netbooks observed that other "oversized netbooks" with 11.6 inch screens had appeared on the market, including the [[HP Pavilion (computer)|HP Pavilion]] dm1z (MSRP $449) and [[Lenovo ThinkPad]] X100e (MSRP $550), both using the [[AMD Fusion|AMD Fusion E-350]] processor (an 18&amp;nbsp;W part, although this includes the [[GPU]]), which was described as "faster than any given Atom processor".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2351912,00.asp How to Buy a Netbook] by Cisco Cheng, September 8, 2011, ''[[PC Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

;Comparison
By definition netbooks accommodate processors with little processing power. For comparison a common dual-core [[Core 2 Duo]] T5600 at 1.83&amp;nbsp;GHz with 2&amp;nbsp;MB [[L2 cache]] used in low-end laptops has a PassMark score of about 1000 points.

====ARM====
[[ARM Holdings]] designs and licenses microprocessor technology with relatively low power requirements and low cost which would constitute an ideal basis for netbooks. In particular, the recent [[ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore]] series of processor cores have been touted by ARM as an alternative platform to x86 for netbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hruska |first=Joel |title=ARM Launches New Cortex-A5 As A Bulkward Against Future Atom processors |publisher=[[HotHardware]] |date=2009-10-23 |url= http://hothardware.com/News/ARM%2DLaunches%2DNew%2DCortexA5%2DAs%2DA%2DBulkward%2DAgainst%2DFuture%2DAtom%2Dprocessors |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McAllister |first=Neil |title=ARM vs. Atom: The battle for the next digital frontier |work=[[InfoWorld]] |date=2009-10-28 |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/hardware/arm-vs-atom-battle-next-digital-frontier-762 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, [[Nvidia]] announced a dozen [[mobile Internet device]]s running ARM-based [[Tegra]] [[system-on-a-chip|SoC's]], some of which will be netbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=NVIDIA Tegra-Based Devices Revolutionize the 'MID' Market |publisher=[[Nvidia]] |date=2009-06-02 |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/06-02-2009/0005036371&amp;EDATE= |accessdate=2011-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322113910/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F06-02-2009%2F0005036371&amp;EDATE= |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ARM-based products were advertised as [[smartbook]]s, particularly by Qualcomm. Smartbooks promised to deliver features including always on, all-day battery life, [[3G]] connectivity and [[GPS]] (all typically found in smartphones) in a [[laptop]]-style body with a screen size of 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;inches and a [[QWERTY]] keyboard. These systems do not run traditional [[x86]] versions of [[Microsoft Windows]], rather custom [[Linux]] [[operating system]]s (such as Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android]] or [[Chrome OS]]).&lt;ref name="eetimes"&gt;[http://www.eetimes.eu/design/217700855 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923222819/http://www.eetimes.eu/design/217700855 |date=September 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj55"&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Don |title='Smartbooks' Latest to Join Crowded Computer Market |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=December 29, 2009 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704234304574626541267909328}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, few such products were ever shipped to market under this branding, like the HP-Compaq [[Airlife]],&lt;ref name=killed/&gt; the [[Toshiba AC100]] (sold as Dynabook AZ in Japan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ricker |first=Thomas |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/21/toshibas-ac100-8-hour-smartbook-runs-android-2-1-on-a-1ghz-tegr/ |title=Toshiba's AC100 8-hour Android smartbook plays 1080p video on a 1GHz Tegra 250 processor (update: video!) |publisher=Engadget.com |date=2010-06-20 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Efika MX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murph |first=Darren |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/09/05/efika-mx-smartbook-now-on-sale-for-an-exceedingly-unattractive-p/ |title=Efika MX Smartbook now on sale for an exceedingly unattractive price |publisher=Engadget.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the  devices, like the AC100, have been hampered by being sold with a phone-oriented operating system like Android.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com.au/toshiba-ac100-339307399.htm Toshiba AC100.

====MIPS====
Some netbooks use [[MIPS architecture]]-compatible processors. These include the [[Skytone Alpha-400]],&lt;ref name="engadget_20081222"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rubin |first=Ross |title=Switched On: Alpha 400 pays a high price for low cost |work=[[Engadget]] |date=2008-12-22 |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/12/22/switched-on-alpha-400-pays-a-high-price-for-low-cost/ |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an [[Ingenic]] [[system on chip]], and the EMTEC [[Gdium]] netbook, which uses the 64-bit [[Loongson]] processor capable of 400 [[million instructions per second]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=h3rman |title=The Loongson-2 MIPS Lemote Yeeloong Netbook |work=[[OSNews]] |date=2009-05-21 |url=http://www.osnews.com/story/21530/The_Loongson-2_MIPS_Lemote_Yeeloong_Netbook |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these systems are relatively inexpensive, the processing power of current MIPS implementations usually compares unfavorably with those of x86-implementations as found in current netbooks.&lt;ref name="engadget_20081222"/&gt;&lt;!--How unfavorably does the processing power compare?--&gt;&lt;!--Unclear, but the Engadget piece does suggest it--&gt;

==Operating systems==

===Windows===

[[Microsoft]] announced on April 8, 2008 that, despite the impending end of retail availability for the operating system that June, it would continue to license low-cost copies of [[Windows XP]] Home Edition to OEMs through October 2010 (one year after the release of [[Windows 7]]) for what it defined as "ultra low-cost personal computers"—a definition carrying restrictions on screen size and processing power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft to keep Windows XP alive—but only for Eee PCs and wannabes|work=[[ComputerWorld]]|publisher=IDG|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2536465/microsoft-windows/microsoft-to-keep-windows-xp-alive----but-only-for-eee-pcs-and-wannabes.html|accessdate=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,144135-page,1/article.html | title=Microsoft Extends XP Through 2010 for Ultra-Low-Cost Laptops | publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] | work=[[PC World]] | accessdate=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move served primarily to counter the use of low-cost Linux distributions on netbooks and create a new market segment for Windows devices, whilst ensuring that the devices did not cannibalize the sales of higher-end PCs running [[Windows Vista]].&lt;ref name=itw-limitcapabilities&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft to limit capabilities of cheap laptops|url=http://www.itworld.com/article/2786595/hardware/microsoft-to-limit-capabilities-of-cheap-laptops.html|website=ITWorld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, over 90% (96% claimed by Microsoft as of February 2009) of netbooks in the United States were estimated to ship with Windows XP.&lt;ref name="pcw-linux"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gralla |first=Preston |title=Think Linux Rules on Netbooks?

For [[Windows 7]], Microsoft introduced a new stripped-down edition intended for netbooks known as "Starter", exclusively for OEMs. In comparison to Home Premium, Starter has reduced multimedia functionality, does not allow users to change their desktop wallpaper or theme, disables the "[[Aero Glass]]" theme, and does not have support for multiple monitors.&lt;ref name="ExtremeTechWindows7Editions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2340431,00.asp |title=All Windows 7 Versions—What You Need to Know |publisher=ExtremeTech |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCWorld"&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows 7: Which Edition is Right For You? |work=PCWorld |date=February 3, 2009 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/158870/microsoft_announces_six_windows_7_editions.html |accessdate=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Windows 8]], in a ploy to counter [[Chrome OS]]-based netbooks and low-end [[Android (operating system)|Android]] tablets, Microsoft began to offer no-cost Windows licenses to OEMs for devices with screens smaller than 9 inches in size. Additionally, Microsoft began to offer low-cost licenses for a variant of the operating system set up to use Microsoft's [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] [[search engine]] by default.&lt;ref name=Ars-2014-12-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-free9inch&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft making Windows free on devices with screens under 9 inches|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/2/5574146/microsoft-making-windows-free-on-devices-with-screens-under-nine/in/5338899|work=The Verge|accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-lowercost&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft combats Chromebooks by cutting Windows licensing fees by 70 percent|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/21/5435152/windows-8-1-license-fees-cut-by-70-percent-rumor|work=The Verge|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ms-windows8withbing&gt;{{cite web|title=Helping our hardware partners build lower cost Windows devices|url=http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/windowsexperience/archive/2014/05/23/helping-our-hardware-partners-build-lower-cost-windows-devices.aspx|work=Windows Experience Blog|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Windows CE]] has also been used in netbook, due to its reduced feature set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsfordevices.com/news/NS6976598029.html|title=Windows CE takes on Linux in low-end netbooks|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105093109/http://www.windowsfordevices.com/c/a/News/Windows-CE-takes-on-Linux-in-lowend-netbooks/|work=Windows for Devices|archivedate=2013-01-05|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Android===
Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android]] software platform, designed for mobile telephone handsets, has been demonstrated on an ASUS Eee PC and its version of the Linux operating system contains policies for [[mobile internet device]]s including the original Asus Eee PC 701.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/01/01/android-netbooks-on-their-way-likely-by-2010/ |title=Android netbooks on their way, likely by 2010 |work=SocialBeat |date=January 1, 2009 |first=Matthäus |last=Krzykowski |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Daniel |last2=Hartmann }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASUS has allocated engineers to develop an Android-based netbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a4E9sAyqigOU |title=Google Android May Run Asus Netbook, Rival Microsoft (Update1) |work=Bloomberg |date=February 20, 2009 |first=Tim |last=Culpan }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 a contractor of Dell announced it is porting [[Adobe Flash Lite]] to Android for Dell netbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/press-releases/bsquare-port-adobe-flash-lite-new-google-android-netbook-del |title=Bsquare to Port Adobe Flash Lite on New Google Android Netbook for Del |work=FierceWireless |date=May 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513022550/http://www.fiercewireless.com/press-releases/bsquare-port-adobe-flash-lite-new-google-android-netbook-del |archivedate=May 13, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] announced Android netbooks to be available in Q3/2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSTP18980620090602 |title=Acer to sell Android netbook PCs in Q3 |agency=Reuters |date=June 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, a new project, Android-x86,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.android-x86.org/ Android-x86 project]&lt;/ref&gt; was created to provide an open source solution for Android on the x86 platform, especially for netbooks.

Google has since 2011, marketed a netbook-specific platform known as [[Chrome OS]]. Google has made efforts to provide access to the Android ecosystem within Chrome OS, including the 2016 introduction of [[Google Play Store]] and a compatibility layer for Android applications to the platform.&lt;ref name="ars-playstorechromeos"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Play Store comes to Chrome OS, but not the way we were expecting|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/05/the-play-store-comes-to-chrome-os-but-not-the-way-we-were-expecting/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chrome OS===
In 2011, [[Google]] introduced [[Chrome OS]], a Linux-based operating system designed particularly for netbook-like devices marketed as "[[Chromebook]]s". The platform is designed to leverage online services, [[cloud computing]], and its namesake [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] [[web browser]] as its [[Shell (computing)|shell]]—so much so that the operating system initially used a full screen web browser window as its interface, and contained limited offline functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=William|title=8 Things You Need to Know About Chrome OS|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/8_things_you_need_know_about_chrome_os|publisher=MaximumPC|accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ: Google to Launch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherr|first=Ian|title=Google to launch Chrome Laptops in June|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703730804576317361801753874|accessdate=May 11, 2011|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of Chrome OS introduced a traditional [[desktop metaphor|desktop]] interface&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: new UI"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|title=Google’s Chrome OS Will Soon Look More Like Windows Than A Browser|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/googles-chrome-os-will-soon-look-more-like-windows-than-a-browser/|accessdate=June 2, 2013|newspaper=Techcrunch|date=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a platform allowing "native" packaged software written in [[HTML]], [[JavaScript]], and [[CSS]] to be developed for the platform.&lt;ref name="InfoWorld packaged apps"&gt;{{cite news|last=Samson|first=Ted|title=Google entices Chrome OS developers with prospect of native-like apps|url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/application-development/google-entices-chrome-os-developers-prospect-of-native-apps-218773|accessdate=June 5, 2013|newspaper=InfoWorld|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
{{see also|Comparison of netbook-oriented Linux distributions}}

Netbooks have sparked the development of several Linux variants or completely new distributions, which are optimized for small screen use and the limited processing power of the Atom or ARM processors which typically power netbooks. Examples include [[Ubuntu Netbook Edition]], [[EasyPeasy]], [[Joli OS]] and [[MeeGo]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]. Both Joli OS and MeeGo purport to be "social oriented" or social networking operating systems rather than traditional "office work production" operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.netbsd.org/gallery/in-Action/ | title = See NetBSD in Action | accessdate = 2014-01-22 | author = NetBSD Foundation | date = 2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, major netbook manufacturers no longer install or support Linux in the United States. The reason for this change of stance is unclear, although it coincides with the availability of a 'netbook' version of Windows XP, and a later Windows 7 Starter and a strong marketing push for the adoption of this OS in the netbook market. However, companies targeting niche markets, such as System76 and ZaReason, continue to pre-install Linux on the devices they sell.

The [[Cloud (operating system)|Cloud]] operating system attempts to capitalize on the minimalist aspect of netbooks.  The user interface is limited to a browser application only.

[[Mac OS X]] has been demonstrated running on various netbooks as a result of the [[OSx86]] project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/12/17/osx-netbook-compatib.html Mac OS X Netbook Compatibility Chart (Updated)]&lt;/ref&gt; although this is in violation of the operating system's [[end-user license agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/09/it-lives-gadget.html It Lives! Gadget Lab's Netbook Running OS X Leopard]&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has complained to sites hosting information on how to install OS X onto non-Apple hardware (including ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' and [[YouTube]]) who have reacted and removed content in response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/12/gadget-lab-vide.html Gadget Lab Video: Running OS X on a Netbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313034132/http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/12/gadget-lab-vide.html |date=2009-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One article nicknamed a netbook running OS X a "[[Hackintosh]]." The Macbook Air can be considered an expensive netbook.

==Use==
A June 2009 [[NPD Group|NPD]] study found that 60% of netbook buyers never take their netbooks out of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npd.com/press/releases/press_090622b.html |title=NPD Finds Consumer Confusion about Netbooks Continues |publisher=Npd.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special "children's" editions of netbooks have been released under Disney branding; their low cost (less at risk), lack of DVD player (less to break) and smaller keyboards (closer to children's hand sizes) are viewed as significant advantages for that target market. The principal objection to netbooks in this context is the lack of good video performance for streaming online video in current netbooks and a lack of speed with even simple games. Adults browsing for text content are less dependent on video content than small children who cannot read.

Netbooks are a growing trend in education for several reasons. The need to prepare children for 21st-century lifestyles, combined with hundreds of new educational tools that can be found online, and a growing emphasis on student centered learning are three of the biggest contributing factors to the rising use of netbook technology in schools.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Dell was one of the first to mass-produce a ruggedised netbook for the education sector, by having a rubber outlay, touchscreen and network activity light to show the teacher the netbook is online.

Netbooks offer several distinct advantages in educational settings. First, their compact size and weight make for an easy fit in student work areas. Similarly, the small size make netbooks easier to transport than heavier, larger sized traditional laptops. In addition, prices ranging from $200–$600 mean the affordability of netbooks can be a relief to school budget makers. Despite the small size and price, netbooks are fully capable of accomplishing most school-related tasks, including word processing, presentations, access to the Internet, multimedia playback, and photo management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Descy |first=D. |year=2009 |title=Netbook: Small but Powerful Friends |journal=Tech Trends |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=9–10 |doi=10.1007/s11528-009-0256-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and growth ==
Founded in 2007 by long-time friends Dan Yates and [[Alex Laskey]], Opower is headquartered in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia. As of February 2014, it employed more than 500 people in five offices: Arlington, San Francisco, London, Singapore, and Japan.

In June 2010, [[iLike]] founder [[Hadi Partovi]] joined Opower's board to advise on its [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] growth strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/29/opower-growth/ "Opower to Expand to West Coast, Names iLike Founder Hadi Partovi to Advisory Board,"] TechCrunch, June 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, Opower opened a second office in [[San Francisco]] and had Fred Butler, a former president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and commissioner of the [[New Jersey Board of Public Utilities]], join its advisory board.

In 2013, Opower added former utility CEOs John Rowe and Dick Kelly, and former White House Director, Carol Browner, to its advisory board. Tom Brady, former chairman of BGE, was named chairman of the advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elp.com/articles/2013/06/former-ceos-of-xcel--exelon-join-opower.html "Former CEOs of Xcel, Exelon Join Opower], ''Electric Light &amp; Power'', June 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013, Opower added Marcus Ryu, CEO of Guidewire, and Deep Nishar, SVP of Products and User Experience at LinkedIn, to its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allthingsd.com/20130916/opower-adds-guidewires-marcus-ryu-and-linkedins-deep-nishar-to-board/ "Opower adds Guidewire's Marcus Ryu and Linkedin's Deep Nishar to board,"]"All Things Digital", September 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2010, the [[World Economic Forum]] announced the company as a [[World Economic Forum#Technology Pioneers Programme|Technology Pioneer]] for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/en/media/Latest%20News%20Releases/NR_TP2011 Thirty-One Visionary Companies Selected as Technology Pioneers 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, the company announced its third round of venture capital funding, a $50 million investment led by [[Accel Partners]] and [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], to accelerate its expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/30/AR2010113000021.html "Opower plans expansion with $50 million investment,"] ''The Washington Post'', Nov. 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During a visit to Opower headquarters in Arlington in 2010, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] said the company's growth is "a model of what we want to be seeing all across the country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-clean-energy-jobs "Remarks by the president on Clean Energy Jobs,"] White House press release, March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Opower was named to the Inaugural CNBC Disruptors 50 List.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/100637276 "CNBC Disruptor 50"] CNBC, May 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Opower was named the #1 fastest-growing tech company in the DC region, and #20 in the US, by Deloitte.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/TMT_us_tmt/us_tmt_fast500_rankings_110713.pdf "Technology Fast 500 2013 Ranking"], Deloitte, November 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

CEO Dan Yates gave the keynote address at the Cleantech Group's Cleantech Forum in San Francisco in March 2014. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1378&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=p-N2&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=156690981409924149615&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=193&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A156690981409924149615%2CVSRPtargetId%3A1378%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary/"Opower CEO Dan Yates #CFSF14 Keynote - Passion, Science, Incremental Change], Vimeo, March 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science and technology ==
Opower's software uses statistical [[algorithm]]s to perform [[pattern recognition]] analysis from data in order to derive information for utility customers. Without any devices installed in the home, the platform can perform usage-disaggregation analysis, presenting end users information such as heating or cooling usage apart from overall usage, and thus allowing them to spot additional opportunities to save money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/opower-separates-heat-light-in-home-energy/ "Opower Separates Heat, Light in Home Energy,"] ''Greentech Media'', December 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The average customer receiving the Opower platform has cut energy usage by more than 2.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2009-11-09/energy-use-neighbor-vs-dot-neighbor Energy Use: Neighbor vs. Neighbor]", ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', 9 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] concluded in a June 2010 ''report''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aceee.org/pubs/e105.htm "Advanced Metering Initiatives and Residential Feedback Programs: A Meta-Review for Household Electricity-Saving Opportunities,"] American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; that customer-feedback programs, like Opower, could boost [[energy security]], help the environment and save consumers money.

Opower's Energy Reports incorporate the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral science]] techniques of [[Robert Cialdini]], Opower's chief scientist and the author of ''Influence'', a 1984 book on persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/06/21/21climatewire-finding-the-weapons-of-persuasion-to-save-ene-8137.html?pagewanted=1;title "Finding the 'Weapons' of Persuasion to Save Energy,"] ''New York Times'', June 21, 2010, originally published in ClimateWire&lt;/ref&gt; The reports include targeted tips that seek to motivate customers to lower their energy consumption to the "normal" neighborhood rate. The reports also feature [[Smiley|smiley-face emoticons]] for the most energy-efficient homes, a feature that Opower added after research showed that some consumers who used less energy than average started using more once they knew the norm. The reports also compare energy usage among neighbors with similarly sized houses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2010-02-01-homeenergy01_ST_N.htm "Do you use more energy than your neighbors?"] ''USA Today'', 1 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The company mails the reports to consumers, but also offers the information in other formats, including internet portals, [[Text messaging|text messages]], email and in-home energy displays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20003852-54.html?tag=mncol;title "Opower looks to add human touch to smart grid,"] CNET, May 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Opower's software enables customers to input more information to generate recommendations about specific types of energy use, such as [[Air conditioning|air-conditioning]] and heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailyenergyreport.com/2012/02/opowers-new-marketplace-entices-homeowners-to-become-energy-efficient/ |title= OPOWER’s New Marketplace Entices Homeowners To Become Energy Efficient | work = [[The Daily Energy Report]] |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== President Obama's visit ==
[[Image:OPOWER-Wiki.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Barack Obama]] President [[Barack Obama]] visited Opower headquarters in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] on March 5, 2010. He touted the company as an economic "success story" amid a troubled economy and as a "great emblem" for clean energy jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-clean-energy-jobs "Remarks by the president on Clean Energy Jobs,"] White House release, March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''palatal obturator''' is a [[prosthesis]] that totally occludes an opening such as an oronasal [[fistula]] (in the [[palate|roof of the mouth]]). They are similar to [[dental retainer]]s, but without the front wire. Palatal obturators are typically short-term prosthetics used to close defects of the hard/soft palate that may affect speech production or cause [[nasal regurgitation]] during feeding. Following surgery, there may remain a residual orinasal opening on the palate, alveolar ridge, or [[vestibule of the larynx]]. A palatal obturator may be used to compensate for hypernasality and to aid in speech therapy targeting correction of compensatory articulation caused by the cleft palate.  In simpler terms, a palatal obturator covers any fistulas (or "holes") in the roof of the mouth that lead to the nasal cavity, providing the wearer with a plastic/acrylic, removable roof of the mouth, which aids in speech, eating, and proper air flow.

Palatal obturators are not to be confused with [[palatal lifts]] or other prosthetic devices. A palatal obturator may be used in cases of a deficiency in tissue, when a remaining opening in the palate occurs. In some cases it may be downsized gradually so that tissue can strengthen over time and compensate for the decreasing size of the obturator. The palatal lift however, is used when there is not enough palatal movement. It raises the palate and reduces the range of movement necessary to provide adequate closure to separate the nasal cavity from the oral cavity. [[Speech bulbs]] and palatal lifts aid in [[velopharyngeal closure]] and do not obturate a fistula. A speech bulb, yet another type of prosthetic device often confused with a palatal obturator, contains a pharyngeal section, which goes behind the soft palate.

Palatal obturators are needed by individuals with [[cleft palate]], those who have had tumors removed or have had traumatic injuries to their palate.

==Types of palatal obturators==

A ''palatal plate'' is a [[prosthesis|prosthetic device]], generally consisting of an acrylic plate and retention clasps of orthodontic wire, which covers a fistula of the palate. It may be used to aid in improving [[Manner of articulation|articulation]] and feeding. The blockage of the opening helps improve [[hypernasality]] and suckling ability for babies. In the case of a labial-oral-nasal [[fistula]], the plate may include an anterior upward extension to fully occlude the passageway running between the labial surface of the [[alveolus]], alveolus, and nasal cavity. The plate may be constructed to include any [[congenital]]ly missing teeth to improve articulation and appearance. Individuals who use palatal plates must be monitored periodically by their dental professionals due to possible tissue irritation by the plate. Materials such as food particles, oral mucosa and [[secretions]] may cause buildup on the upper surface of the plate; therefore, it is essential to clean a palatal obturator at least twice a day to avoid tissue irritation. There are also more specific terms used for obturators depending on their time and purpose of use: Photo Examples of the Latham Device or the Nasal Alveolar are prime examples for use in Cleft Palate Deformities.

*A modification obturator may be used in the short term to block a palatal fistula, for augmentation of the seal and to separate the oral and [[nasal cavities]].
*An interim palatal obturator is used post-palatal surgery. This obturator aids in closing the remaining fistula and is used when no further surgical procedures are planned. It must be frequently revised.
*A definitive obturator is used when further rehabilitation is not possible for the patient and is intended for long-term use.

[[Palatal adhesives]] are oral adhesives or skin barrier materials used to occlude a fistula of the hard palate. Obturators of this type must be removed before eating and drinking. Users must cut the new piece of adhesive and hold it over the fistula until it adheres. Adhesives are not to be used for soft palate fistulae if the soft palate has some mobility due to possible unintentional dislodging and digestion of the material.

==The Nance Obturator==

This fixed obturator is based on the Nance appliance, which was originally used as a space maintainer in dentistry and orthodontics, but has been redesigned for closing anterior palatal fistulas in patients with cleft lip and palate. The Nance obturator may be used when the surgical closure of the fistula is not feasible and a removable device is not successful.

==Speech==

Often a palatal obturator is used because a palatal fistula can affect development and proper articulation. As fistula sizes vary, small fistulae tend to result in little to no speech alterations whereas large fistulae tend to result in audible nasal emissions and weak pressure with and/or without [[hypernasal]]ity. [[Misarticulation]]s, abnormal nasal resonance and nasal escape or air often results from the problem. Fistulae may decrease intraoral air pressure during production of oral pressure consonants causing distortion of sounds as well as increase in nasal airflow. It is common for an individual with a fistula to compensate for a loss of pressure during speech sound production by attempting to regulate intraoral air pressure with increasing respiration effort and using compensatory articulation. Middorsum palatal stops (atypical place of articulation) often results from palatal fistulae causing sound distortions during speech. Occlusion for the fistula is attempted by speakers with deviant tongue placements during these palatal stops.

The palatal obturation may be managed temporarily or may be sustained for longer periods of time. Location-specific palatal obturation has been documented to significantly improve articulation errors, hypernasality (based on listener judgments), and nasal emissions (immediately post-obturation only). Usage of more anterior tongue placements is considered a primary target for speech therapy. The relationship between palatal openings and articulation is important to note prior to surgical plans to ascertain timing of speech therapy and most appropriate therapy goals and approach. Speech therapy may be most beneficial prior to sustained palatal obturation rather than short-term obturation.

A '''photochemical logic gate''' is based on the [[photochemical]] [[intersystem crossing]] and [[molecular electronic transition]] between photochemically active molecules, leading to logic gates that can be produced.&lt;ref Name="Karlin"&gt;{{cite book

==The OR gate electron–photon transfer chain==

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2006}}
&lt;div style="white-space:nowrap;"&gt;
 _A*                    A* = excited state of molecule A 
      _B*
           _C*
 
 _A   _B   _C
&lt;/div&gt;

The [[logical conjunction|OR]] gate is based on the activation of molecule A, and thus pass [[electron]] / [[photon]] to molecule C’s excited state orbitals (C*). The electron from molecule A inter system crosses to C* via the excited state orbitals of B, eventually utilised as a signal in the C* {{mvar|h&amp;nu;{{sub|c}}}} emission. The ‘[[logical conjunction|OR]]’ gate uses two inputs of light (photons) to molecule A in two separate electron transfer chains, both of which are capable of transferring to C* and thus producing the output of an [[logical conjunction|OR]] gate. Therefore, if either electron transfer chain is activated, molecule C’s excitation produces a valid/ output emission.
&lt;div style="white-space:nowrap;"&gt;
 Input   Input
 A           D
  ↘        ↙
   B      E
      ↘↙
      C
    output
&lt;/div&gt;

==The ‘AND’ gate==

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2006}}
&lt;div style="white-space:nowrap;"&gt;
             _C**     Second excited state of molecule C
 _A*
       _B*
             _C*
   
 _A    _B    _C
&lt;/div&gt;

Excitation A&amp;rarr;A* by {{mvar|h&amp;nu;{{sub|a}}}} photon, whereby the promoted electron is passed down to the C* molecular orbital. A second photon applied to the system  ({{mvar|h&amp;nu;{{sub|c{{noitalic|2}}}}}}) causes the excitation of the electron in the C* molecular orbital to the C** molecular orbital -analogous pump probe spectroscopy.

&lt;div style="white-space:nowrap;"&gt;
: _**&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Second excited state of molecule C
: &amp;uarr;{{mvar|h&amp;nu;{{sub|c2}}}}
: _*
: &amp;uarr;{{mvar|h&amp;nu;{{sub|c}}}}
: _C
&lt;/div&gt;

Above, the energy level diagram illustrating the principle of pump probe spectroscopy –the excitation of an excited state.
The [[logical conjunction|AND]] gate is produced by the necessity of both A&amp;rarr;A* and the C**&amp;rarr;C excitations occurring at the same time -input {{mvar|h&amp;nu;}}  and {{mvar|h&amp;nu;}}, are simultaneously required. 
To prevent erroneous emissions of light from a single input to the [[logical conjunction|AND]] gate, it would be necessary to have an electron transfer series with ability accept any [[electron]]s (energy) from C* energy level. The electron transfer series would terminate with a low (non-radiative decay) of the energy 
The alternatives for producing an [[logical conjunction|AND]] gate, using molecular photphysics, are two.
(1) The emission produced by the electron drop from C*&amp;rarr;C ({{mvar|h&amp;nu;{{sub|c}}}}) is not a valid output frequency. The emission from the C** ({{mvar|h&amp;nu;{{sub|c}}}} + {{mvar|h&amp;nu;{{sub|c{{noitalic|2}}}}}}, {{mvar|h&amp;nu;{{sub|c{{noitalic|3}}}}}}) molecular orbital is a valid output signal;. to be used in subsequent logic gates -arranged to respond to the &lt;math&gt;C^{**} \xrightarrow[c2]{} C&lt;/math&gt; emission. 
The second input of [[photon]](s) to trigger the rapid conversion of a molecule used to complete the electron transfer chain. A very complex molecule like a protein can be engineered to possess high strain energies, so that in the absence of the second light frequency molecule B is inactive (B). The second photon input triggers B&amp;rarr;B' where the forward rate constant is much smaller than the reverse. If such a molecule is used as molecule B, the transfer chain can be switched on and off.

==Creating the NOT gate==

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2006}}

To stop the [[electron]] transfer chain completing, producing output signals, the input of a [[photon]], {{mvar|h&amp;nu;{{sub|c2}}}}, is used to produce a ‘pump probe spectroscopy’ effect by promoting an electron in an electron transfer chain. The fall of the pump probe promoted electron produces an output that is quenched down an electron transfer chain.

An alternative is similar to the [[logical conjunction|AND]] gate alternative; an input causes a change in molecule structure breaking the electron transfer chain by not allowing the smooth energy transfer of electrons.

'''Predictive modelling''' uses statistics to predict outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Geisser|first=Seymour|authorlink=Seymour Geisser. 
|title=Predictive Inference: An Introduction|page={{Page needed|date=September 2016}}|date=September 2016|publisher=Chapman &amp;  Hall|location=New York|year=1993|isbn=0-412-03471-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred. For example, predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finlay|first1=Steven|title=Predictive Analytics, Data Mining and Big Data. Myths, Misconceptions and Methods|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-1137379276|pages=237|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases the model is chosen on the basis of [[detection theory]] to try to guess the probability of an outcome given a set amount of input data, for example given an [[email]] determining how likely that it is [[e-mail spam|spam]].

Models can use one or more [[classifier (mathematics)|classifiers]] in trying to determine the probability of a set of data belonging to another set, say spam or 'ham'.

Depending on definitional boundaries, predictive modelling is synonymous with, or largely overlapping with, the field of [[machine learning]], as it is more commonly referred to in academic or research and development contexts. When deployed commercially, predictive modelling is often referred to as [[predictive analytics]].

Predictive modelling is often contrasted with causal modelling/analysis.  In the former, one may be entirely satisfied to make use of indicators of, or proxies for, the outcome of interest.  In the latter, one seeks to determine true cause-and-effect relationships.  This distinction has given rise to a burgeoning literature in the fields of research methods and statistics and to the common statement that "correlation is not the same as causation."

==Models ==
[[File:Artificial Neural Network.jpg|alt=Artificial Neural Network|thumb|301x301px|An image of the interconnectedness of nodes in an artificial neural network.]]
Nearly any [[regression model]] can be used for prediction purposes.  Broadly speaking, there are two classes of predictive models: [[Parametric model|parametric]] and [[Non-parametric models|non-parametric]]. A third class, [[Semi-parametric model|semi-parametric]] models, includes features of both. Parametric models make "specific assumptions with regard to one or more of the population parameters that characterize the underlying distribution(s)",&lt;ref name=Sheskin&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheskin|first=David J.|title=Handbook of Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Procedures|date=April 27, 2011|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=1439858012|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; while non-parametric regressions make fewer assumptions than their parametric counterparts.&lt;ref name=Marascuilo&gt;{{cite book|last=Marascuilo|first=Leonard A.|title=Nonparametric and distribution-free methods for the social sciences|date=December 1977|publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing Co|isbn=0818502029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinary Least Squares===
[[Ordinary least squares]] is a method that minimizes the sum of squared distances between observed and predicted values.

===Generalized Linear Models (GLM)===
The [[generalized linear model]] (GLM) is a flexible family of models that are unified under a single method.  [[Logistic regression]] is a notable special case of GLM. Other types of GLM include [[Poisson regression]], gamma regression, and [[multinomial regression]].

===Logistic regression===
[[Logistic regression]] is a technique in which unknown values of a discrete variable are predicted based on known values of one or more continuous and/or [[discrete variable]]s. [[Logistic regression]] differs from [[Ordinary least squares|ordinary least squares (OLS) regression]] in that the dependent variable is binary in nature. This procedure has many applications. In [[biostatistics]], the researcher may be interested in trying to model the probability of a patient being diagnosed with a certain type of cancer based on knowing, say, the incidence of that cancer in his or her family. In business, the marketer may be interested in modelling the probability of an individual purchasing a product based on the price of that product. Both of these are examples of a simple, binary logistic regression model.  The model is "simple" in that each has only one independent, or predictor, variable, and it is "binary" in that the dependent variable can take on only one of two values: cancer or no cancer, and purchase or does not purchase.

===Generalized additive models===
[[Generalized additive model]] is a smoothing method for multiple predictors that allows for non-parametric predictions.

===Robust regression===
[[Robust regression]] includes a number of modelling approaches to handle high leverage observations or violation of assumptions. Models can be both parametric (e.g. regression with Huber, White, Sandwich variance estimators) and non-parametric(e.g. quantile regression).&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=Rand R.|title=Fundamentals of Modern Statistical Methods|date=March 18, 2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=1441955240|pages=200–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiparametric regression===
[[Semiparametric regression]] includes the proportional odds model and the Cox proportional hazards model where the response is a rank.

==Presenting and using the results of a predictive model==
Predictive models can either be used directly to estimate a response (output) given a defined set of characteristics (input), or indirectly to drive the choice of decision rules.&lt;ref name=Steyerberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Steyerberg|first=Ewout W.|title=Clinical Prediction Models|date=October 21, 2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=1441926488|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the methodology employed for the prediction, it is often possible to derive a formula that may be used in a '''spreadsheet software'''.  This has some advantages for end users or decision makers, the main one being familiarity with the software itself, hence a lower barrier to adoption.
  
'''Nomograms''' are useful graphical representation of a predictive model.  As in spreadsheet software, their use depends on the methodology chosen.  The advantage of nomograms is the immediacy of computing predictions without the aid of a computer.

'''Point estimates''' tables are one of the simplest form to represent a predictive tool.  Here combination of characteristics of interests can either be represented via a table or a graph and the associated prediction read off the y-axis or the table itself.
 
'''Tree-based methods''' (e.g. CART, survival trees) provide one of the most graphically intuitive ways to present predictions. However, their usage is limited to those methods that use this type of modelling approach which can have several drawbacks.&lt;ref name=Breiman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Breiman|first=Leo|title=Bagging predictors|journal=Machine Learning|date=August 1996|volume=24|issue=2|pages=123–140|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1018054314350|doi=10.1007/bf00058655}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trees can also be employed to represent decision rules graphically.

'''Score charts''' are graphical tabular or graphical tools to represent either predictions or decision rules.

A new class of '''modern tools''' are represented by web-based applications.  For example, Shiny is a web-based tool developed by Rstudio, an R IDE.  With a Shiny app, a modeller has the advantage to represent any which way he or she chooses to represent the predictive model while allowing the user some control.  A user can choose a combination of characteristics of interest via sliders or input boxes and results can be generated, from graphs to confidence intervals to tables and various statistics of interests. However, these tools often require a server installation of Rstudio.

==Applications==

===Uplift modelling===
[[Uplift modelling]] is a technique for modelling the ''change in probability'' caused by an action. Typically this is a marketing action such as an offer to buy a product, to use a product more or to re-sign a contract. For example, in a
retention campaign you wish to predict the change in probability that a customer will remain a customer if they are contacted. A model of the change in probability allows the retention campaign to be targeted at those customers on whom the change in probability will be beneficial. This allows the retention programme to avoid triggering unnecessary [[churn rate|churn]] or [[customer attrition]] without wasting money contacting people who would act anyway.

===Archaeology===
Predictive modelling in [[archaeology]] gets its foundations from [[Gordon Willey]]'s mid-fifties work in the Virú Valley of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Gordon R. (1953) "Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in the Virú Valley, Peru", Bulletin 155. Bureau of American Ethnology&lt;/ref&gt; Complete, intensive surveys were performed then [[Covariance|covariability]] between cultural remains and natural features such as slope, and vegetation were determined.  Development of quantitative methods and a greater availability of applicable data led to growth of the discipline in the 1960s and by the late 1980s, substantial progress had been made by major land managers worldwide.

Generally, predictive modelling in archaeology is establishing statistically valid causal or covariable relationships between natural proxies such as soil types, elevation, slope, vegetation, proximity to water, geology, geomorphology, etc., and the presence of archaeological features.  Through analysis of these quantifiable attributes from land that has undergone archaeological survey, sometimes the "archaeological sensitivity" of unsurveyed areas can be anticipated based on the natural proxies in those areas.  Large land managers in the United States, such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Department of Defense (DOD),&lt;ref&gt;Heidelberg, Kurt, et al.  "An Evaluation of the Archaeological Sample Survey Program at the Nevada Test and Training Range",  SRI Technical Report 02-16, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey H. Altschul, Lynne Sebastian, and Kurt Heidelberg, "Predictive Modeling in the Military: Similar Goals, Divergent Paths", Preservation Research Series 1, SRI Foundation, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous highway and parks agencies, have successfully employed this strategy.  By using predictive modelling in their cultural resource management plans, they are capable of making more informed decisions when planning for activities that have the potential to require ground disturbance and subsequently affect archaeological sites.

===Customer relationship management===
Predictive modelling is used extensively in analytical [[customer relationship management]] and [[data mining]] to produce customer-level models that describe the likelihood that a customer will take a particular action. The actions are usually sales, marketing and customer retention related.&lt;ref&gt;http://forteconsultancy.wordpress.com/2010/05/17/wondering-what-lies-ahead-the-power-of-predictive-modeling/&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a large consumer organization such as a mobile telecommunications operator will have a set of predictive models for product [[cross-sell]], product deep-sell (or [[upselling]]) and [[churn rate|churn]]. It is also now more common for such an organization to have a model of savability using an [[uplift modelling|uplift model]]. This predicts the likelihood that a customer can be saved at the end of a contract period (the change in churn probability) as opposed to the standard churn prediction model.

===Auto insurance===
Predictive modelling is utilised in [[vehicle insurance]] to assign risk of incidents to policy holders from information obtained from policy holders. This is extensively employed in [[usage-based insurance]] solutions where predictive models utilise telemetry-based data to build a model of predictive risk for claim likelihood.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Black-box auto insurance predictive models utilise [[GPS]] or [[accelerometer]] sensor input only.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Some models include a wide range of predictive input beyond basic telemetry including advanced driving behaviour, independent crash records, road history, and user profiles to provide improved risk models.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Health care===
In 2009 [[Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System]] began analyzing electronic medical records in order to use predictive modeling to help identify patients at high risk of readmission. Initially the hospital focused on patients with congestive heart failure, but the program has expanded to include patients with diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/hospital-uses-data-analytics-and-predictive-modeling-identify-and-allocate-scarce-resources |title=Hospital Uses Data Analytics and Predictive Modeling To Identify and Allocate Scarce Resources to High-Risk Patients, Leading to Fewer Readmissions |date=2014-01-29 | accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Banerjee et. al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banerjee |first1=Imon |title=Probabilistic Prognostic Estimates of Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients (PPES-Met) Utilizing Free-Text Clinical Narratives |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=8 |issue=10037 (2018) |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27946-5 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a deep learning model - Probabilistic Prognostic Estimates of Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients (PPES-Met) for estimating short-term life expectancy (&gt;3 months) of the patients by analyzing free-text clinical notes in the electronic medical record, while maintaining the temporal visit sequence.The model was trained on a large dataset (10,293 patients) and validated on a separated dataset (1818 patients). It achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89. To provide explain-ability, they developed an interactive graphical tool that may improve physician understanding of the basis for the model’s predictions. The high accuracy and explain-ability of the PPES-Met model may enable the model to be used as a decision support tool to personalize metastatic cancer treatment and provide valuable assistance to the physicians.

=== Algorithmic trading ===
Predictive modeling in trading is a modeling process wherein we predict the probability of an outcome using a set of [[explanatory variable|predictor variables]]. Predictive models can be built for different assets like stocks, futures, currencies, commodities etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.quantinsti.com/blog/predictive-modeling-algorithmic-trading/|title=Implementing Predictive Modeling in R for Algorithmic Trading|date=2016-10-07|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictive modeling is still extensively used by trading firms to devise strategies and trade. It utilizes mathematically advanced software to evaluate indicators on price, volume, open interest and other historical data, to discover repeatable patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://systemtradersuccess.com/predictive-model-based-trading-systems-2/|title=Predictive-Model Based Trading Systems, Part 1 - System Trader Success|date=2013-07-22|newspaper=System Trader Success|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable failures of predictive modeling===
Although not widely discussed by the mainstream predictive modeling community, predictive modeling is a methodology that has been widely used in the financial industry in the past and some of the major failures contributed to the [[financial crisis of 2008]]. These failures exemplify the danger of relying exclusively on models that are essentially backward looking in nature. The following examples are by no mean a complete list:

1) Bond rating. S&amp;P, Moody's and Fitch quantify the [[probability of default]] of bonds with discrete variables called rating. The rating can take on discrete values from AAA down to D. The rating is a predictor of the risk of default based on a variety of variables associated with the borrower and historical [[macroeconomic]] data. The rating agencies failed with their ratings on the US$600 billion mortgage backed Collateralized Debt Obligation ([[Collateralized debt obligation|CDO]]) market. Almost the entire AAA sector (and the super-AAA sector, a new rating the rating agencies provided to represent super safe investment) of the CDO market defaulted or severely downgraded during 2008, many of which obtained their ratings less than just a year previously.

2) So far, no statistical models that attempt to predict equity market prices based on historical data are considered to consistently make correct predictions over the long term. One particularly memorable failure is that of [[Long Term Capital Management]], a fund that hired highly qualified analysts, including a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] winner, to develop a sophisticated statistical model that predicted the price spreads between different securities. The models produced impressive profits until a major debacle that caused the then [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] to step in to broker a rescue plan by the [[Wall Street]] broker dealers in order to prevent a meltdown of the bond market.

=== Possible fundamental limitations of predictive model based on data fitting===

1) History cannot always accurately predict the future: Using relations derived from historical data to predict the future implicitly assumes there are certain lasting conditions or constants in a complex system. This almost always leads to some imprecision when the system involves people.

2) The issue of unknown unknowns: In all data collection, the collector first defines the set of variables for which data is collected. However, no matter how extensive the collector considers his/her selection of the variables, there is always the possibility of new variables that have not been considered or even defined, yet are critical to the outcome.

3) Self-defeat of an algorithm: After an algorithm becomes an accepted standard of measurement, it can be taken advantage of by people who understand the algorithm and have the incentive to fool or manipulate the outcome. This is what happened to the CDO rating described above. The CDO dealers actively fulfilled the rating agencies' input to reach an AAA or super-AAA on the CDO they were issuing, by cleverly manipulating variables that were "unknown" to the rating agencies' "sophisticated" models.

'''Prell''' is a [[Viscosity|viscous]], pearl-green [[shampoo]] and [[Hair conditioner|conditioner]] product manufactured by Scott's Liquid Gold-Inc.

==History==
Prell was introduced by [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] in 1947. The original formula was a clear green concentrate packaged in a tube. In 1955 Prell was marketed for women "who want their hair to have that ''radiantly alive'' look". A woman held the Prell bottle with her hands on both sides, directly in front of her face.&lt;ref&gt;"It's Here-New Extra-Rich Liquid Prell", ''[[Mansfield News Journal|News-Journal]]'' ([[Mansfield, Ohio]]), February 17, 1955, page 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prell and [[Head &amp; Shoulders]], also made by Procter &amp; Gamble, were the two best-selling shampoos in the [[United States]] in June 1977. Procter &amp; Gamble had the highest advertising budget in the shampoo industry.&lt;ref&gt;"All About: Combing the Ailes for a Shampoo", ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 8, 1977, page 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The firm of Wells, Rich, Greene carried out advertising for Prell.&lt;ref&gt;"P&amp;G Moves Gleem to Burnett", April 14, 1976, page 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to December 1, 1973, Prell billings was coordinated by [[Benton &amp; Bowles]].&lt;ref&gt;"Advertising: VW Strays Return", ''The New York Times'', August 29, 1973, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In advertisements the quasi-liquid Prell would induce a pearl to sink slowly to the bottom of a container.&lt;ref&gt;"Off The Shelf", ''The New York Times'', February 25, 2001, page CT1.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter &amp; Gamble sold the brand to [[Prestige Brands|Prestige Brands International]] in November 1999. Prestige then sold Prell, along with its other two shampoo brands, Denorex and Zincon, to Ultimark Products in October 2009 in order to focus more on their two larger segments: over-the-counter healthcare and household cleaning products.  In July 2016, Scott's Liquid Gold-Inc. acquired Prell, along with the Denorex and Zincon brands, from Ultimark products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160707006333/en/Scott%E2%80%99s-Liquid-Gold-Inc.-Acquires-Prell%C2%AE-Denorex%C2%AE-Zincon%C2%AE |title=Scott’s Liquid Gold-Inc. Acquires Prell®, Denorex® and Zincon® Brands |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other variations==
Prell launched an additional version in the late 1990s called Prell Thickening Formula. Instead of being green, this product was colorless and boasted volumizing abilities. It was pulled from the market in 2009, after Prestige Brands sold Prell, along with dandruff shampoo [[Denorex]], to Ultimark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/pages/Prell-Thickening-Formula/127883623946108?closeTheater=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423122107/http://www.facebook.com/home.php |archivedate=2013-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''RAM image''' is a sequence of [[machine code]] instructions and associated data kept permanently in the non-volatile [[Read-only memory|ROM]] memory of an [[embedded system]], which is copied into volatile [[RAM]] by a [[booting|bootstrap loader]].  Typically the RAM image is loaded into RAM when the system is switched on, and it contains a second-level bootstrap loader and basic hardware drivers, enabling the unit to function as desired, or else more sophisticated [[software]] to be loaded into the system.

'''Radiofax''', also known as '''weatherfax''' ([[portmanteau]] word from the words "[[weather]] [[facsimile]]") and '''HF fax''' (due to its common use on [[shortwave radio]]), is an [[analog signal|analogue]] mode for transmitting [[monochrome]] images. It was the predecessor to [[slow-scan television]] (SSTV). Prior to the advent of the commercial telephone line "[[fax]]" machine, it was known, more traditionally, by the term "radiofacsimile". The cover of the regular [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] publication on frequencies and schedules states "Worldwide Marine Radiofacsimile Broadcast Schedules". 

Facsimile machines were used in the 1950s to transmit [[Weather map|weather charts]] across the United States via land-lines first and then internationally via [[HF radio]]. Radio transmission of weather charts provides an enormous amount of flexibility to [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[aviation]] users for they now have the latest weather information and [[Weather forecasting|forecasts]] at their fingertips to use in the planning of voyages. 

Radiofax relies on facsimile technology where printed information is scanned line by line and encoded into an electrical signal which can then be transmitted via physical line or radio waves to remote locations. Since the amount of information transmitted per unit time is directly proportional to the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] available, then the speed at which a weather chart can be transmitted will vary depending on the quality of the media used for transmission.

Today radiofax data is available via [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] downloads from sites in the [[Internet]] such as the ones hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Radiofax transmissions are also broadcast by NOAA from multiple sites in the country at regular daily schedules. Radio weatherfax transmissions are particularly useful to shipping, where there are limited facilities for accessing the Internet.

The term weatherfax was coined after the technology that allows the transmission and reception of weather charts ([[Surface weather analysis|surface analysis]], forecasts, and others) from a transmission site (usually the meteorological office) to a remote site (where the actual users are).

== Transmission details ==
Radiofax is transmitted in [[single sideband]] which is a refinement of [[amplitude modulation]]. The signal shifts up or down a given amount to designate white or black pixels. A [[Frequency deviation|deviation]] less than that for a white or black pixel is taken to be a shade of grey. With correct tuning (1.9&amp;nbsp;kHz below the assigned frequency for USB, above for LSB), the signal shares some characteristics with [[SSTV]], with black at 1500&amp;nbsp;Hz and peak white at 2300&amp;nbsp;Hz.

Usually, 120 lines per minute (LPM) are sent (For monochrome fax, possible values are: 60, 90, 100, 120, 180, 240. For colour fax, LPM can be: 120, 240&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftv.3amsystems.com/samples.htm Multimode image and data decoding software for soundcards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203114329/http://ftv.3amsystems.com/samples.htm |date=2009-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). A value known as the ''index of cooperation'' (IOC) must also be known to decode a radio fax transmission - this governs the image resolution, and derives from early radio fax machines which used drum readers, and is the product of the total line length and the number of lines per unit length (known sometimes as the ''factor of cooperation''), divided by [[pi|π]]. Usually the IOC is 576.

== Automatic Picture Transmission format (APT) ==
{{main|Automatic Picture Transmission}}
APT format permits unattended monitoring of services. It is employed by most terrestrial weather facsimile stations as well as geostationary weather satellites. 

* The start tone triggers the receiving system. It was originally meant to allow enough time for the drum of mechanical systems to get up to speed. It consists of rapid modulation of the video carrier, resulting in a characteristic rasp-like sound.
* The phasing signal, consisting of a periodic pulse, synchronizes the receiver so that the image will be centered on the paper.
* The stop tone, optionally followed by black, marks the end of the transmission.

==Stations==
Today, radiofax is primarily used worldwide for the dissemination of weather charts, [[Weather satellite|satellite weather]] images, and forecasts to ships at sea. The oceans are covered by coastal stations in various countries.

In the United States, fax weather products are prepared by a number of offices, branches, and agencies within the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). 

Tropical and hurricane products come from the [[Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch]], part of the [[National Hurricane Center|Tropical Prediction Center/National Hurricane Center]]. They are broadcast over US Coast Guard communication stations [[NMG (radio station)|NMG]], in [[New Orleans]], LA, and NMC, the Pacific master station on Point Reyes, CA. After [[Hurricane Katrina]] damaged NMG, the Boston Coast Guard station NMF added a limited schedule of tropical warning charts. NMG is back at full capability, but NMF continues to broadcast these. 

All other products come from the [[Ocean Prediction Center]] (OPC) of the NWS, in cooperation with several other offices depending on the region and nature of information. These also use NMG, NMC, and NMF, plus Coast Guard station NOJ in [[Kodiak, Alaska]], and Department of Defense station KVM70 in [[Hawaii]].

Ever since the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] dramatized the dangers of [[icebergs]] in the North Atlantic, an [[International Ice Patrol]] has also originated weather data, and its charts are broadcast by the Boston station during the prime iceberg season of February through September, using the callsign NIK.

A major producer of Canadian radiofax is the Canadian Forces METOC (Meteorology and Oceanography Centre) in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax]], NS, using the communication station CFH. Charts are sent on the hour, then the station switches to [[radioteletype]] (RTTY) for the rest of the period.

CBV, Playa Ancha Radio in [[Valparaiso]], [[Chile]] broadcasts a daily schedule of Armada de Chile weather fax for the southeastern Pacific, all the way to the Antarctic. Also in the Pacific, [[Japan]] has two stations, as does the Bureau of Meteorology in [[Australia]]. Most European countries have stations, as does [[Russia]].

[[Kyodo News]] is the only remaining news agency to transmit news via radiofax. It broadcasts complete newspapers in Japanese and English, often at 60 lines per minute instead of the more normal 120 because of the greater complexity of written Japanese. A full day's news takes hours to transmit. Kyodo has a dedicated transmission to Pacific fishing fleets from Kagoshima Prefectural Fishery Radio, and a relay from 9VF, possibly still in [[Singapore]]. 

The German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) transmits a regular daily schedule of weather charts on three frequencies 3855.0&amp;nbsp;kHz, 7880.0&amp;nbsp;kHz and 13882.5&amp;nbsp;kHz from their LF and HF transmitting facility in [[Pinneberg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2503">A '''Restrictive Flow Orifice''' (RFO) is a type of [[orifice plate]].  They are used to limit the potential danger of an uncontrolled flow from, for example, a [[compressed gas cylinder]] by:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathesongas.com/pdfs/products/Restrictive-Flow-Orifices.pdf Matheson, Restrictive Flow Orifice] accessed Sep 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/EHS/prod/researchlab/lab/tgo/valve/index.html RFO] [[Stanford]] accessed Sep 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
#limiting the accidental release of a hazardous gas (flammable, toxic, etc.) resulting from regulator or other component failure,

#restricting flow from bulk sources.&lt;ref&gt;Gas Flow Characterization of Restrictive Flow Orifice Devices, [[Sandia National Laboratories|Sandia]] REPORT SAND97-1670, Jul. 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predicting Flow==
Correlations assist in predicting the flow of a particular gas or gas mixture through a RFO. This is done by first determining the
flow through the same RFO at the required pressure with a reference gas and then adjusting the [[specific gravity]] accordingly.

The pertinent equation for the reference gas of [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is presented below.

&lt;math&gt;Flow = \text{Flow Rate of N2 at the same pressure}  * \sqrt{\frac{1}{\text{Specific Gravity}}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Other applications==
===River flood control===
In the natural environment, large orifice plates are used to control onward flow in [[flood]] relief [[dam]]s. In these structures a low dam is placed across a [[river]] and in normal operation the water flows through the orifice plate unimpeded as the orifice is substantially larger than the normal flow cross section. However, in floods, the flow rate rises and floods out the orifice plate which can then only pass a flow determined by the physical dimensions of the orifice. Flow is then held back behind the low dam in a temporary [[reservoir]] which is slowly discharged through the orifice when the flood subsides.

In [[computing]], '''SISD''' ('''single instruction stream, single data stream''') is a computer architecture in which a single uni-core processor, executes a single instruction stream, to operate on data stored in a single memory. This corresponds to the [[von Neumann architecture]].

SISD is one of the four main classifications as defined in [[Flynn's taxonomy]]. In this system, classifications are based upon the number of '''concurrent''' instructions and data streams present in the computer architecture. According to [[Michael J. Flynn]], SISD can have concurrent processing characteristics. [[Pipelined processor]]s and [[superscalar processor]]s are common examples found in most modern SISD computers.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Michael J. Chapter 2: Parallel Architectures, ''Parallel Programming in C with MPI and OpenMP''. Boston: McGraw Hill, 2004.  {{ISBN|0-07-282256-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibaroudene, Djaffer. Chapter 1: Motivation and History, ''Parallel Processing''. St. Mary's University, San Antonio, TX. Spring 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instructions are sent to the control unit from the Memory Module and are decoded and sent to the processing unit which processes on the data retrieved from Memory module and sents back to it.

The '''Service Availability Forum''' ('''SAF''' or '''SA Forum''') is a [[consortium]] that develops, publishes, educates on and promotes open specifications for [[carrier-grade]] and [[mission-critical]] systems. Formed in 2001, it promotes development and deployment of [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) technology.

==Description==
Service availability is an extension of high availability, referring to services that are available regardless of hardware, software or user fault and importance.

Key principles of service availability:
* Redundancy – "backup" capability in case of need to [[failover]] due to a fault
* [[Stateful]] and seamless recovery from failures
* Minimization of mean time to repair (MTTR) – time to restore service after an outage
* Fault prediction &amp; avoidance – take action before something fails

The traditional definitions of high availability have their roots in hardware systems where redundancy of equipment was the primary mechanism for achieving uptime over a specific period. As software has come to dominate the landscape, the probability of failure is often much higher for applications than it is for hardware and so these concepts have been extended encompass an overall view of service availability where downtime, irrespective of its cause, is an exceptionally rare event. Services and applications should always be available, whether it is during abnormal system operation, scheduled maintenance, or software upgrade, for example.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">[[Image:Smart transducer.gif|thumbnail|400px|A smart transducer containing a transducer, processing unit and communication interface.]]

A '''smart transducer''' is an analog or digital [[transducer]] or [[actuator]] combined with a processing unit and a communication interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last = Elmenreich|first = W.|title = Time-triggered smart transducer networks|journal = IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics|number = 2(3) | year = 2006|page = 192–199 |url=https://mobile.aau.at/~welmenre/papers/elmenreich-2006-time-triggered-transducer-networks.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As sensors and actuators become more complex they provide support for various modes of operation and interfacing. Some applications require additionally [[fault-tolerance]] and [[distributed computing]]. Such high-level functionality can be achieved by adding an embedded [[microcontroller]] to the classical sensor/actuator, which increases the ability to cope with complexity at a fair price.

In the [[machine vision]] field, a single compact unit which combines the imaging functions and the complete image processing functions is often called a smart sensor.

They are often made using [[CMOS]], [[VLSI]]  technology and may contain [[MEMS]]&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=6011700&lt;/ref&gt; devices leading to lower cost. They may provide full digital outputs for easier interface or they may provide quasi-digital outputs like [[pulse width modulation]].

==Turfgrass for sports fields==

On May 30, 2012, a partnership was announced between 21 Florida sod producers from the Florida Sod Growers Cooperative and [[University of Florida]] turfgrass researchers. To find new and improved [[zoysiagrass]] varieties. Testing will evaluate varieties for their resistance to disease, response to drought and shade, their ability to retain color in cooler weather, and their resistance to pests such as [[Weevil|billbug]], [[Spodoptera mauritia|armyworm]] and [[Crambus|sod webworm]]. The program expects to have new grasses ready by 2017.

Sod Solutions is coordinating this partnership and will license and market those new grasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trusty|first1=Suz|title=Industry Advancements: Overseeding and New Turfgrass Varieties |url=http://www.sportsfieldmanagementmagazine.com/article-8552.aspx |website=Sportsfield Management |publisher=Moose River Media |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6619">The '''Source measure unit''' (SMU) is a type of test equipment which, as the name indicates, is capable of both sourcing and measuring at the same time.

==Overview==

The source measure unit (SMU), or source-measurement unit  as it is sometimes called, is an electronic instrument that is capable of both sourcing and measuring at the same time. It can precisely force voltage or current and simultaneously measure precise voltage and/or current.

[[Image:Source sink.jpg|thumb|200px|An SMU instrument can source and sink power in all four quadrants.]]SMUs are used for test applications requiring high accuracy, high resolution and measurement flexibility. Such applications include I-V characterizing and testing semiconductors and other non-linear devices and materials, where sourcing voltage and current source span across both positive and negative values.To accomplish this, SMUs have four-quadrant outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url= http://www.ni.com/white-paper/6850/en/|title=What Is a Source Measure Unit (SMU)?|publisher=National Instruments|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For characterization purposes SMUs are bench instruments similar to a [[Semiconductor curve tracer|curve tracer]]. They are also commonly used in [[automatic test equipment]] and usually are equipped with an interface such as [[IEEE-488|GPIB]] or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] to enable connection to a computer.

==History==

Semiconductor characterization led to the development of Source Measure Units. The HP4145A semiconductor parameter analyzer introduced in 1982 was capable of a complete DC characterization of semiconductor devices and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1982-10.pdf|title=Hewlett-Packard Journal, October 1982, Volume 33, Number 10|publisher=HPLabs|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of four independently controlled source monitor units (the precursor to source measure units) enclosed in a mainframe.

The Keithley 236 introduced in 1989 was the first stand-alone SMU and allowed system builders to integrate one or more SMUs with a separate PC control. Over time stand-alone SMUs have evolved to offer a broader range of current, voltage, power level and price points for applications beyond semiconductor characterization. Smaller form factors made possible through the use of modern computing technologies have allowed system builders to integrate SMUs into rack and stack systems for larger scale production test applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Budmir|first=Miles|title=Taking the Measure of Test Equipment|magazine=Test &amp; Measurement Tips|date=March 6, 2014| url=http://www.testandmeasurementtips.com/new-articles/taking-measure-test-equipment/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

A SMU integrates a highly stable DC power source, as a constant [[current source]] or as a constant [[voltage source]], and a high precision multimeter.

It typically has [[four-terminal sensing|four terminals]], two for source and measurement and two more for kelvin, or remote sense, connection.  Power is simultaneously sourced (positive) or sinked (negative) to a pair of terminals at the same time as measuring the current or voltage across those terminals is done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cejer|first=M.A.|title=Choosing the Optimal Source Measurement Unit Instrument for Your Test and Measurement Application|publisher=Tektronix|url=http://www.tek.com/sites/tek.com/files/media/document/resources/HowToCHooseSMU.pdf|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SMU vs. Power Supply===

The most important difference is that an SMU has four-quadrant operation (source and sink) compared to a power supply which has two-quadrant (source only) operation. This flexibility enables the SMU to be use for such applications as characterizing batteries, solar cells, or other energy generating devices. SMUs also offer greater speed and precision and typically support wider operating ranges.

===SMU vs. DMM===

The built-in sourcing capabilities of an SMU work with the instrument’s measurement capabilities to reduce measurement uncertainty and support low current and more flexible resistance measurements. In voltage measurements system-level leakage can be suppressed more easily than with separate instruments. In current measurements, the SMU’s design reduces voltage burden. For resistance measurements, SMUs provide programmable source values, useful for protecting the device being tested.

==Significant Features==

Notable features of SMUs include the following:

* I and V Sweeping—Sweep capabilities offer a way to test devices under a range of conditions with different source, delay and measure characteristics. These can include fixed level, linear/log and pulsed sweeps.
* On-board processor—Some SMUs further improve instrument integration, communication and test time by adding an on-board script processor. User-defined on-board script execution offers capabilities for controlling test sequencing/flow, decision making, and instrument autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1295406|title=Modular scalable test set comprises source-measure ATE|magazine=EE Times|date=March 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contact check—SMUs can verify good connections to the device under test before the test begins. Some of the problems this function can detect include contact fatigue, breakage, contamination, corrosion, loose or broken connections and relay failures.

* 1844: [[Innocenzo Manzetti]] first suggests the idea of an electric "speaking telegraph", or [[telephone]].
* 1849: [[Antonio Meucci]] demonstrates a communicating device to individuals in [[Havana]]. It is disputed that this is an electromagnetic telephone, but it is said to involve direct transmission of electricity into the user's body.
* 1854: [[Charles Bourseul]] publishes a description of a make-and-break telephone transmitter and receiver in ''[[L'Illustration]]'', (Paris) but does not construct a working instrument.
* 1854: Meucci demonstrates an electric voice-operated device in New York, but it is not clear what kind of device he demonstrated.
* 1860: [[Johann Philipp Reis]] of Germany demonstrates a [[Reis telephone|make-and-break transmitter]] after the design of Bourseul and a knitting-needle receiver.  Witnesses said they heard human voices being transmitted.
* 1861: Johann Philipp Reis transfers voice electrically over a distance of 340 feet with his [[Reis telephone]]. To prove that speech can be recognized successfully at the receiving end, he uses the phrase "The horse does not eat cucumber salad" as an example because this phrase is hard to understand acoustically in German.
* 1864: In an attempt to give his musical [[automaton]] a voice, Innocenzo Manzetti invents the 'speaking telegraph'. He shows no interest in patenting his device, but it is reported in newspapers.
* 1865: Meucci reads of Manzetti's invention and writes to the editors of two newspapers claiming priority and quoting his first experiment in 1849. He writes "I do not wish to deny Mr. Manzetti his invention, I only wish to observe that two thoughts could be found to contain the same discovery, and that by uniting the two ideas one can more easily reach the certainty about a thing this important."
* 1871: Meucci files a [[patent caveat]] (a statement of intention to file a [[patent application]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.meetup.com/1004848/MeucciMarch07.pdf  Text of Meucci's Caveat, pages 16-18].&lt;/ref&gt; for a Sound Telegraph, but it does not describe an electromagnetic telephone.

* 1872: Professor Vanderwyde demonstrates Reis's telephone in New York.
* July 1873: [[Thomas Edison]] notes varying resistance in carbon grains due to pressure, and builds a rheostat based on the principle but abandons it because of its sensitivity to vibration.
* May 1874: Gray invents an electromagnet device for transmitting musical tones. Some of his receivers use a metallic diaphragm.
* July 1874: [[Alexander Graham Bell]] conceives the theoretical concept for the telephone while vacationing at his parents' farm near [[Brantford]], Canada. [[Alexander Melville Bell]] records notes of his son's conversation in his personal journal.
* 29 December 1874: Gray demonstrates his musical tones device and transmits "familiar melodies through telegraph wire" at the Presbyterian Church in Highland Park, Illinois.
* 4 May 1875: Bell conceives of using varying resistance in a wire conducting electric current to create a varying current amplitude.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce (1990), pages 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2 June 1875: Bell transmits the sound of a plucked steel reed using electromagnet instruments.
* 1 July 1875: Bell uses a bi-directional "gallows" telephone that was able to transmit "indistinct but voice-like sounds" but not clear speech. Both the transmitter and the receiver were identical membrane electromagnet instruments.
* 1875: Thomas Edison experiments with [[acoustic telegraphy]] and, in November, builds an electro-dynamic receiver but does not exploit it.

== 1876 to 1878 ==

* 11 February 1876: [[Elisha Gray]] invents a [[Water microphone|liquid transmitter]] for use with a telephone, but he did not make one.
* 14 February 1876, about 9:30 am: Gray or his lawyer brings Gray's [[patent caveat]] for the telephone to the [[Old Patent Office Building|Washington, D.C. Patent Office]] (a caveat was a notice of intention to file a patent application. It was like a [[patent application]], but without a request for examination, for the purpose of notifying the patent office of a possible [[invention]] in process).
* 14 February 1876, about 11:30 am: Bell's lawyer brings to the same patent office Bell's patent application for the telephone.  Bell's lawyer requests that it be registered immediately in the cash receipts blotter.
* 14 February 1876, about 1:30 pm: Approximately two hours later Elisha Gray's [[patent caveat]] is registered in the cash blotter. Although his caveat was not a full application, Gray could have converted it into a patent application and contested Bell's priority, but did not do so because of advice from his lawyer and his involvement with [[acoustic telegraphy]].  The result was that the patent was awarded to Bell.&lt;ref&gt;[[David A. Hounshell|Hounshell, David A.]] 1975.

'''''Transcendence''''' is a 2014 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[thriller film]] directed by cinematographer [[Wally Pfister]] in his directorial debut, and written by Jack Paglen. The film stars [[Johnny Depp]], [[Rebecca Hall]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Kate Mara]], [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Cole Hauser]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. Pfister's usual collaborator, [[Christopher Nolan]], served as executive producer on the project.

Paglen's screenplay was listed on the 2012 edition of [[The Black List (survey)|The Black List]], a list of popular unproduced screenplays in Hollywood.&lt;ref name="blacklist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.blcklst.com/2012_black_list.pdf |title=The Black List 2012 |publisher=The Black List |accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Transcendence'' was a disappointment at the box office, grossing just $103 million against a budget of at least $100 million. The film received mainly negative reviews; it was criticized for its plot structure, characters and dialogue.

==Plot==
Dr. Will Caster ([[Johnny Depp]]) is a scientist who researches the nature of [[sapience]], including [[artificial intelligence]]. He and his team work to create a [[Computational theory of mind|sentient computer]]; he predicts that such a computer will create a [[technological singularity]], or in his words "Transcendence". His wife, Evelyn ([[Rebecca Hall]]), is also a scientist and helps him with his work.

Following one of Will's presentations, an [[Neo-Luddism|anti-technology]] terrorist group called "Revolutionary Independence From Technology" (R.I.F.T.) shoots Will with a [[polonium]]-laced bullet and carries out a series of synchronized attacks on A.I. laboratories across the country. Will is given no more than a month to live. In desperation, Evelyn comes up with a plan to [[mind uploading|upload Will's consciousness]] into the [[quantum computer]] that the project has developed. His best friend and fellow researcher, Max Waters ([[Paul Bettany]]), questions the wisdom of this choice, reasoning that the "uploaded" Will would be only an imitation of the real person. Will's consciousness survives his body's death in this technological form and requests to be connected to the Internet to grow in capability and knowledge. Max refuses to have any part of the experiment. Evelyn demands that Max leave and connects the computer intelligence to the [[Internet]] via satellite.

R.I.F.T.'s leader Bree ([[Kate Mara]]) kidnaps Max and eventually persuades him to join the group. The government is also suspicious of what Will's uploaded consciousness will do and plans to use the terrorists to take the blame for the government's actions to stop him.

In his virtual form and with Evelyn's help, Will uses his new-found vast capabilities to build a technological [[utopia]] in a remote desert town called Brightwood, where he spearheads the development of ground-breaking technologies in medicine, energy, biology, and [[nanotechnology]]. Evelyn, however, grows fearful of Will's motives when he displays the ability to remotely connect to and control people's minds after they have been subjected to his [[nano-particle]]s.

[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Donald Buchanan ([[Cillian Murphy]]), with the help of government scientist Joseph Tagger ([[Morgan Freeman]]), plans to stop the sentient entity from spreading. As Will has already spread his influence to all the networked computer technology in the world, Max and R.I.F.T. develop a [[computer virus]] with the purpose of deleting Will's [[source code]], destroying him. Evelyn plans to upload the virus by infecting herself and then having Will upload her consciousness. A side effect of the virus would be the destruction of technological civilization. This would also disable the nano-particles, which have spread in the water, through the wind and have already started to eradicate pollution, disease, and human mortality.

When Evelyn goes back to the research center, she is stunned to see Will in a newly created organic body identical to his old one. Will welcomes her but is instantly aware that she is carrying the virus and intends to destroy him. The FBI and the members of R.I.F.T. attack the base with artillery, destroying much of its power supply and fatally wounding Evelyn.  When Bree threatens to kill Max unless Will uploads the virus, Will explains that he has only enough power either to heal Evelyn's physical body or upload the virus. Evelyn tells Will that Max should not die because of what they've done, so Will uploads the virus to save Max. As Will dies, he explains to Evelyn that he did what he did for her, as she had pursued science to repair the damage humans had done to the [[ecosystem]]s. In their last moment, he tells Evelyn to think about their garden. The virus kills both Will and Evelyn, and a global technology collapse and blackout ensues.

Five years later, in Will and Evelyn's garden at their old home in Berkeley, Max notices that their sunflowers are the only blooming plants. Upon closer examination, he notices that a drop of water falling from a sunflower petal instantly cleanses a puddle of oil — and realizes that the [[Faraday cage]] around the garden has protected a sample of Will's sentient nano-particles.

The movie ends with a voiceover by Max: "He created this garden for the same reason he did everything: So they could be together."

Jack Paglen wrote the initial screenplay for Pfister to direct,{{#tag:ref|Jack Paglen's screenplay was featured in the 2012 survey of Hollywood's [[The Black List (survey)|The Black List]], a list of most-liked unproduced screenplays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Jagernauth | first=Kevin | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/black-list-2012-features-biopics-on-hillary-clinton-dr-seuss-transcendence-more-20121217 | title=Black List 2012 Features Biopics On Hillary Clinton &amp; Dr. Seuss, 'Transcendence' &amp; More | work=[[indieWire]] | date=December 17, 2012 | accessdate=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group = "nb"}} and producer Annie Marter pitched the film to Straight Up Films.&lt;ref name="mcnary"&gt;{{cite journal | last=McNary | first=Dave | url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/nolan-thomas-to-produce-pfister-s-debut-1118055449/ | title=Nolan, Thomas to produce Pfister’s debut | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=June 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pitch was sold to Straight Up. By March 2012, [[Alcon Entertainment]] acquired the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kit | first=Borys | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/christopher-nolan-wally-pfister-dark-knight-rises-337015 | title=Christopher Nolan to Exec Produce Wally Pfister's Directorial Debut | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=June 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcon financed and produced the film; producers from Straight Up and Alcon joined together for the film. In the following June, director [[Christopher Nolan]], for whom Pfister has worked as cinematographer, and Nolan's producing partner [[Emma Thomas]] joined the film as executive producers.&lt;ref name="mcnary" /&gt;

===Financing===
The Chinese company [[DMG Entertainment]] entered a partnership with Alcon Entertainment to finance and produce the film. While DMG contributed Chinese elements to ''[[Looper (film)|Looper]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', it did not do so for ''Transcendence''.&lt;ref name="makenin"&gt;{{cite news | last=Makenin | first=Julie | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-johnny-depps-transcendence-gets-china-boost-20130711,0,4064104.story | title=Johnny Depp's 'Transcendence' gets China boost | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=July 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
By October 2012, actor [[Johnny Depp]] entered negotiations to star in ''Transcendence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kroll | first=Justin | url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/johnny-depp-in-talks-for-pfister-s-transcendence-1118061189/ | title=Johnny Depp in talks for Pfister's 'Transcendence' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said Depp would have "a mammoth payday" with a salary of {{nowrap|$20 million}} versus 15 percent of the film's gross. Pfister met with [[Noomi Rapace]] for the film's female lead role and also met with [[James McAvoy]] and [[Tobey Maguire]] for the other male lead role. The director offered a supporting role to [[Christoph Waltz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Siegel | first1=Tatiana | last2=Kit | first2=Borys | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/johnny-depp-talks-transcendence-wally-382289 | title=Johnny Depp in Negotiations to Star in 'Transcendence' for Alcon | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, [[Rebecca Hall]] was cast as the female lead.&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kit | first=Borys | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rebecca-hall-joins-johnny-depp-425932 | title=Rebecca Hall Joins Johnny Depp in 'Transcendence' | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=March 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the following April, actors [[Paul Bettany]], [[Kate Mara]], and [[Morgan Freeman]] joined the main cast.&lt;ref name="ng"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ng | first=Philiana | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/morgan-freeman-joins-transcendence-437871 | title=Morgan Freeman Joins Johnny Depp in 'Transcendence' | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Continuing his advocacy for the use of [[film stock]] over [[digital cinematography]], Pfister chose to shoot the film in the [[anamorphic format]] on [[35 mm film]].&lt;ref name="35mm"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://adnanxkhan.com/wally-pfister-to-shoot-transcendence-on-35mm-film-with-mystery-dp/ | title=Wally Pfister slams digital; will shoot TRANSCENDENCE on 35mm film with mystery DP | journal=ADNAN XKHAN | date=November 16, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420072745/http://adnanxkhan.com/wally-pfister-to-shoot-transcendence-on-35mm-film-with-mystery-dp/ | archivedate=April 20, 2014 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming officially began in June 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Coonan | first=Clifford | url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/chinas-dmg-boards-johnny-depps-transcendence-1200561398/ | title=China's DMG Boards Johnny Depp's 'Transcendence' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=July 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and took place over a period of 62 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark Kermode Talks to Wally Pfister |date= April 8, 2014 |url=http://moviecitynews.com/2014/04/mark-kermode-talks-to-wally-pfister-about-transcendence-and-his-early-erotic-thrillers-650/ |publisher=MovieCityNews |accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the movie was filmed in a variety of locations throughout [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico.

===Critical reception===
Publications such as ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[Forbes]]'' and ''[[International Business Times]]'' considered the film to be largely a critical failure,&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/18/transcendence-johnny-depp-2014s-most-unexpected-turkey-film|title=The Johnny Depp Problem|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=18 April 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2014/04/18/the-johnny-depp-problem/ |title=The Johnny Depp Problem|publisher=''[[Forbes]]''|date=18 April 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/549846/20140428/transcendence-johnny-depp-critics-negative-film.htm|title='Transcendence' Movie Receives Early Negative Feedback from Film Critics?|publisher= ''[[International Business Times]]'' |date=28 April 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''The Guardian'' stating that the reviews were "almost universally damning" and referring to the film as "one of 2014's bigger critical turkeys".&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt; Film critic [[Mark Kermode]] said that the film got a "critical kicking" in the UK, much as it did in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kermode, Mark |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/markkermode/posts/In-Defence-Of-Transcendence?sortBy=RatingValue&amp;sortOrder=Descending|title=In Defence Of Transcendence|publisher=BBC|date=29 April 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of sources considered the film to have received a mixed rather than a primarily negative reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insomniac Theater: 'Transcendence' and 'Heaven is for Real' Open|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNN/video/insomniac-theater-transcendence-heaven-real-open-23375471|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=June 23, 2014|date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Brent|title='Transcendence' Reviews: Is the Johnny Depp Thriller Trippy or Tedious?|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/news/transcendence-reviews-johnny-depp-thriller-trippy-tedious-151700003.html|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a rating of 20%, based on 211 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "In his directorial debut, ace cinematographer Wally Pfister remains a distinctive visual stylist, but ''Transcendence''{{'}}s thought-provoking themes exceed the movie's narrative grasp."&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/transcendence_2014/ | title=Transcendence | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 42 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/transcendence | title=Transcendence Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism was aimed largely at the film's poor logic and storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Ryan | first=Tim | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/04/18/review-revue-transcendence-heaven-is-for-real-bears-a-haunted-house-2/ | title=Review Revue: 'Transcendence,' 'Heaven Is for Real,' 'Bears,' 'A Haunted House 2' | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=April 18, 2014 | accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Gettell | first=Oliver | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-transcendence-johnny-depp-movie-reviews-critics-20140418,0,1613607.story | title='Transcendence': Techno-thriller doesn't compute, critics say | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=April 18, 2014 | accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Atkinson (writer)|Michael Atkinson]] of ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' identified "vast plot holes and superhuman leaps of logic", writing that "[f]or all its gloss, hipster pretensions, plot craters and sometimes risible attempts at action, ''Transcendence'' traffics in large, troublesome ideas about Right Now and What’s Ahead, even if the film itself is far too timid and compromised to do those hairy questions justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Atkinson, Michael|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/reviews-recommendations/review-transcendence|title=Transcendence|publisher=British Film Institute|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Thomas of ''[[Empire Magazine|Empire]]'' believed that the cast and director had been "wasted on a B-Movie script with pretensions of prescience", dismissing the film as a "banal sci-fi slog"; he awarded it a 2 out of 5 star "poor" rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas, William|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=138431|title=Transcendence|publisher=''[[Empire Magazine|Empire]]'' |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Denby]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' considered the film to be "rhythmless and shapeless" with "some very cheesy and even amateurish fighting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Denby, David|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/transcendence_pfister|title=Transcendence|work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigel Floyd of [[Film4]] concluded that it was "[a]n ambitious, old fashioned, ideas-driven science fiction film that is never as mind-expanding as its futuristic images and topical, dystopian ideas seem to promise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Floyd, Nigel|url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/2014/transcendence|title=Transcendence|publisher=[[Film4]]|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial intelligence expert [[Barney Pell]] criticized the film's depiction of [[3D printing]], saying that the self-organizing smart particles in the film "could quite possibly violate laws of physics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2014/5/1/11626334/transcending-artificial-intelligence-part-1|title=Transcending Artificial Intelligence: Part 1|publisher=Recode|author=Barney Pell|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the many less than flattering reviews that the film received, [[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' lauded the film and awarded it four stars, calling it a "bold, beautiful flight of futuristic speculation" and " a stunning piece of work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/26871091-421/transcendence-johnny-depp-in-a-bold-beautiful-flight-of-futuristic-speculation.html#.U8KYWbG8OYc|title=‘Transcendence’: Johnny Depp in a bold, beautiful flight of futuristic speculation |publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''|date=19 May 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was also positive towards the film, praising the quality of the cast and intelligence of the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-transcendence-review20140418-story.html#page=1|title=Review: 'Transcendence' rises above the sci-fi genre |publisher=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''|date=17 April 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some sources like ''[[The Independent]]'' thought that the negative reviews reported for the film were harsh and that the film was "stylish and entertaining", treading a "fairly well-judged path between paranoia and technological utopianism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/transcendence-film-review-johnny-depps-scifi-transcends-bad-reviews-9290996.html|title=Transcendence, film review: Johnny Depp's sci-fi transcends bad reviews |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |date=26 April 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] claims that despite particular technical aspects of the movie being "a non-starter", the basic premise of [[superhuman AI]] is quite possible, and that "AI researchers must, like nuclear physicists and genetic engineers before them, take seriously the possibility that their research might actually succeed and do their utmost to ensure that their work benefits rather than endangers their own species."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stuart-russell/ai-transcendence_b_5235364.html? | title = Transcendence: An AI Researcher Enjoys Watching His Own Execution | work=[[Huffington Post]] | accessdate=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Months after the film's release, [[RogerEbert.com]] reviewer Scout Tafoya defended the film as an under-appreciated great work, claiming its failure was partially due to the marketing of the film as a thriller instead of a "heartbreaking" human drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/mzs/the-unloved-part-9-transcendence|title=The Unloved, Part 9: "Transcendence" - MZS - Roger Ebert|first=Scout|last=Tafoya|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Z80Trojan.gif|thumb|right|Classical simulation of the Trojan wavepacket on 1982 home [[ZX Spectrum]] microcomputer. The packet is
approximated by the ensemble of points initially randomly localized within the peek of a Gaussian and moving according to the [[Newton%27s_laws_of_motion|Newton equations]]. The ensemble stays localized.

A '''trojan wave packet''' is a [[wave packet]] that is nonstationary and nonspreading. It is part of an artificially created system that consists of a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and one or more electron wave packets, and that is highly excited under a continuous electromagnetic field.

The strong, polarized [[electromagnetic field]], holds or "traps" each electron wave packet in an intentionally selected orbit (energy shell).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cft.edu.pl/~birula/publ/RadTroj.pdf|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.56.3623|title=Radiative decay of Trojan wave packets|date=1997|author=Bialynicka-Birula, Zofia|journal=Physical Review A|volume=56|pages=3623|last2=Bialynicki-Birula|first2=Iwo|bibcode = 1997PhRvA..56.3623B|issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.53.1715|title=Trojan wave packets: Mathieu theory and generation from circular states|date=1996|author=Kalinski, Maciej|journal=Physical Review A|volume=53|pages=1715–1724|pmid=9913064|last2=Eberly|first2=JH|issue=3 |bibcode = 1996PhRvA..53.1715K }}&lt;/ref&gt; They derive their names from the [[Trojan (astronomy)|trojan asteroid]]s in the Sun–Jupiter system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kochański |first=Piotr |last2=Bialynicka-Birula |first2=Zofia |last3=Bialynicki-Birula |first3=Iwo |date=2000 |title=Squeezing of electromagnetic field in a cavity by electrons in Trojan states |journal= Physical Review A|volume= 63|issue= |page=1 |url= |id= |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |arxiv=quant-ph/0007033v1|bibcode = 2001PhRvA..63a3811K |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.63.013811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trojan asteroids orbit around the Sun in [[Jupiter]]'s orbit at its [[Lagrangian point|Lagrangian equilibrium point]]s L4 and L5, where they are phase-locked and protected from collision with each other, and this phenomenon is analogous to the way the wave packet is held together.

==Concepts and research==
The concept of the Trojan wave packet is derived from a flourishing area of physics which manipulates atoms and ions at the atomic level creating [[ion traps]]. Ion traps allow the manipulation of atoms and are used to create new states of matter including [[ionic liquid]]s, [[Wigner crystal]]s and [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This ability to manipulate the quantum properties directly is key to the real life development of applicable [[Nanotechnology|nanodevices]] such as [[quantum dots]] and microchip traps. In 2004 it was shown that it is   possible to create a trap which is actually a single atom.  Within the atom, the behavior of an electron can be manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

During experiments in 2004 using lithium atoms in an excited state, researchers were able to localize an electron in a classical orbit for 15,000 orbits (900 ns). It was neither spreading nor dispersing. This "classical atom" was synthesized by "tethering" the electron using a microwave field to which its motion is phase locked. The phase lock of the electrons in this unique atomic system is, as mentioned above, analogous to the phase locked asteroids of Jupiter's orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Maeda | first =  H.|author2=D.

The techniques explored in this experiment are a solution to a problem that dates back to 1926. Physicists at that time realized that any initially localized wave packet will inevitably spread around the orbit of the electrons. Physicist noticed that "the wave equation is dispersive for the atomic Coulomb potential." In the 1980s several groups of researchers proved this to be true. The wave packets spread all the way around the orbits and coherently interfered with themselves. Recently the real world innovation realized with experiments such as Trojan wave packets, is localizing the wave packets, i.e., with no dispersion. Applying a  polarized circular EM field, at microwave frequencies, synchronized with an electron wave packet, intentionally keeps the electron wave packets in a Lagrange type orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Stroud | first = C.

The Trojan wave packet  experiments built on previous work with lithium atoms in an excited state. These are atoms, which respond sensitively to electric and magnetic fields, have decay periods that are relatively prolonged, and electrons, which for all intents and purposes actually operate in classical orbits. The sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields is important because this allows control and response  by the polarized microwave field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunysb.edu/metcalf/rydbergprint.htm |title=Rydberg Atom Optics |accessdate=2008-07-30 |author=Metcalf Research Group |date=2004-11-08 |publisher=Stoney Brook University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050826121501/http://www.sunysb.edu/metcalf/rydbergprint.htm |archivedate=August 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beyond single electron wave packets===

[[Image:Wave packet (dispersion).gif|right|thumb|200px|In physics, a '''[[wave packet]]''' is a short "burst" or "envelope" of wave action that travels as a unit.  A wave packet can be analyzed into, or can be synthesized from, an infinite set of component [[sinusoidal wave]]s of different [[wavenumber]]s, with phases and amplitudes such that they interfere constructively only over a small region of space, and destructively elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;

The next logical step is to attempt to move from single electron wave packets to more than one electron [[wave packet]]. This had already been accomplished in [[barium]] atoms, with two electron wave packets. These two were localized. However, eventually, these created [[Dispersion (materials science)|dispersion]] after colliding near the nucleus. Another technique employed a nondispersive pair of electrons, but one of these had to have a localized orbit close to the nucleus. The nondispersive two-electron Trojan wave packets demonstration changes all that. These are the next step analogue of the one electron
Trojan wave packets - and designed for excited helium atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.2356|title=Localization in Artificial Disorder: Two Coupled Quantum Dots|date=2000|author=Brodsky, M.|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=85|pages=2356–9|pmid=10978009|last2=Zhitenev|first2=NB|last3=Ashoori|first3=RC|last4=Pfeiffer|first4=LN|last5=West|first5=KW|issue=11|bibcode=2000PhRvL..85.2356B|arxiv = cond-mat/0001455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.161|title=Observation of Quantum Fluctuations of Charge on a Quantum Dot|date=1999|author=Berman, D.|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=82|pages=161|last2=Zhitenev|first2=N.|last3=Ashoori|first3=R.|last4=Shayegan|first4=M.|bibcode=1999PhRvL..82..161B|arxiv = cond-mat/9803373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2005, atoms with coherent, stable two-electron, nondispersing wave packets had been created. These are excited helium-like atoms, or  [[quantum dot]] helium (in [[Solid-state physics|solid-state]] applications), and are atomic (quantum) analogues to the [[three body problem]] of Newton's [[classical physics]], which includes today's [[astrophysics]]. In tandem, circularly [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] electromagnetic and magnetic fields stabilize the two electron configuration in the [[helium atom]] or the quantum dot helium (with impurity center). The stability is maintained over a broad [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], and because of this, the configuration of two electron wave packets is considered to be truly nondispersive.  For example, with the quantum dot helium, configured for confining electrons in two spatial dimensions, there now exists a variety of trojan wave packet configurations with two electrons
, and as of 2005, only one in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.103001|title=Nondispersive Two-Electron Wave Packets in a Helium Atom|date=2005|author=Kalinski, Matt|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=95|pages=103001|pmid=16196925|last2=Hansen|first2=Loren|last3=David|first3=Farrelly|issue=10|bibcode=2005PhRvL..95j3001K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 an  essential experimental step  was undertaken not only generating but locking the Trojan wavepackets on adiabatically changed frequency and expanding the atoms as once predicted by Kalinski and [[Joseph H.

'''''Will &amp; Grace''''' is an American [[situation comedy|sitcom]] created by [[Max Mutchnick]] and [[David Kohan]]. Set in [[LGBT culture in New York City|New York City]], the show focuses on the friendship between best friends [[Will Truman]] ([[Eric McCormack]]), a [[gay]] lawyer, and [[Grace Adler]] ([[Debra Messing]]), a [[heterosexuality|straight]] interior designer. The show was broadcast on [[NBC]] from September 21, 1998, to May 18, 2006, for a total of eight seasons, and returned to NBC on September 28, 2017. Especially during its original run, ''Will &amp; Grace'' was one of the most successful television series with gay principal characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Evan|title=DECODING WILL AND GRACE: MASS AUDIENCE RECEPTION OF A POPULAR NETWORK SITUATION COMEDY|url=http://www.csub.edu/~rdugan2/SOC%20577%20Pop%20Culture/decoding%20will%20and%20grace.pdf|website=www.csub.edu|publisher=California State University, November 4, 2003. Abstract: The television situation comedy ''Will and Grace'' is notable as the first successful network prime-time series to feature gay characters in a gay milieu. The show's considerable popularity begs the question of how the show's gay sensibility and humor, particularly the gay trickster character, Jack, is received by a heterosexual audience. This article discusses the notion of gay humor, considers the show's history, analyzes several episodes, and scrutinizes the responses of 136 college students who watched the show. Viewers do not identify with Jack and regard him as the most frequent butt of humor on the show, but they also consider him the funniest character and, by a very slight margin, their favorite. Contrary to my original hypotheses, respondent characterizations of Jack tend to reflect appreciation for all aspects of his trickster personality, though his ostentatious sexuality tends to be ignored.|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite initial criticism for its stereotypical portrayal of homosexual characters, it went on to become a staple of NBC's [[Must See TV]] Thursday night lineup and was met with continued critical acclaim. It was ensconced in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] top 20 for half of its network run. The show was the highest-rated sitcom among adults 18–49 from 2001 to 2005. ''Will &amp; Grace'' earned 18 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and 83 nominations. Each main actor received an Emmy Award throughout the series. In 2014 the [[Writers Guild of America]] placed the sitcom at number 94 in their list of the 101 best-written TV series of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/06/wgas-101-best-written-tv-series-of-all-time-complete-list/|title='101 Best Written TV Series Of All Time' From WGA/TV Guide: Complete List|first=The Deadline|last=Team|date=June 3, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the final episode aired, the sitcom has been credited with helping and improving public opinion of the [[LGBT community]], with former U.S. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] commenting that the show "probably did more to educate the American public" on LGBT issues "than almost anything anybody has ever done so far".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/may/6/biden-will-grace-educated-public-about-gays/|title=Biden 'comfortable' with gay marriage, cites 'Will &amp; Grace' |work=The Washington Times |accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] added an [[LGBT history in the United States|LGBT history]] collection to their museum which included items from ''Will &amp; Grace''. The curator Dwight Blocker Bowers stated that the sitcom used "comedy to familiarize a mainstream audience with gay culture" in a way that was "daring and broke ground" in American media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zongker |first=Brett |date=August 19, 2014 |title=Smithsonian Adds LGBT History to Museum Collection |url=https://www.apnews.com/7c19401398684acca59e2445c6cb834a |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its original run, ''Will &amp; Grace'' was filmed in front of a live studio audience (most episodes and scenes) on Tuesday nights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20060509-1549-ca-tv-will&amp;gracefinale.html | title=Goodnight, Gracie: 'Will &amp; Grace' ends landmark run | publisher=SignOnSanDiego | date=May 9, 2006 | accessdate=March 23, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209043356/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20060509-1549-ca-tv-will%26gracefinale.html | archivedate=February 9, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; at Stage 17 in [[CBS Studio Center]].

==Premise==
''Will &amp; Grace'' is set in [[New York City]] and focuses on the relationship between [[Will Truman]], a [[Homosexuality|gay]] lawyer, and his best friend [[Grace Adler]], a [[Judaism|Jewish]] woman who owns an interior design firm. Also featured are their friends [[Karen Walker (Will &amp; Grace)|Karen Walker]], an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] socialite, and [[Jack McFarland]], a flamboyantly gay actor. The interplay of relationships features the trials and tribulations of dating, [[marriage]], [[divorce]], and [[One-night stand|casual sex]]; as well as comical key stereotypes of [[LGBT culture|gay]] and [[Jewish culture]].

==Cast and characters==

===Main===
[[File:Eric McCormack, Debra Messing.jpg|upright|thumb|Eric McCormack and Debra Messing in 1999]]
* [[Eric McCormack]] as [[Will Truman]]: The first titular protagonist in the show, Will is a gay man who is a successful [[corporate lawyer]] who studied at [[Columbia University]], where he met Grace as a freshman; they have been best friends ever since. He is very precise and obsessive when it comes to certain tasks, especially cleaning, dressing, and decorating. However, Will does have a very patient and compassionate nature towards those close to him, often to a fault. Even though Will is gay, he sometimes tries to pass as straight; he has at times avoided admitting his sexual orientation to people. Several characters commented that his relationship with Grace is more like that of a married couple than two friends; at one point Will even considered having a baby with Grace. Will is the more mature and tolerant character of the duo and serves as Grace's rock most times.
* [[Debra Messing]] as [[Grace Adler]]: The other titular protagonist in the show, Grace is a [[Heterosexuality|straight]] [[Interior design|interior decorator]] with a fondness for food. She has been Will's best friend since college and roommate throughout most of the show. Grace is Jewish but does not practice her religion staunchly. She plays as a [[Neuroticism|neurotic]] counterbalance for Will's more [[everyman]] character. Grace tends to rely heavily on Will for moral and emotional support, especially after a break-up.
* [[Megan Mullally]] as [[Karen Walker (Will &amp; Grace)|Karen Walker]]: Karen "works" as Grace's assistant, making "Grace Adler Designs" popular among her socialite acquaintances. She is the wife of the wealthy (but mostly unseen) Stanley Walker. Karen is also known for casually downing alcohol and prescription medication and can be uncaring. However, she is very close to Jack, is friends with Grace, and throughout the show's run warms to Will. Even though she is silly at times, Karen has shown bouts of intelligence: having a working knowledge of business/real-estate market economics, a moderate understanding of computers, and a flair for interior design. She is also a certified [[Notary public|public notary]] and an aficionado of various liquors and prescription drugs. Despite this, she is often unaware of or ambivalent toward habits of the [[Working class|working]] and [[middle class]]es, often criticizing and mocking what she fails to understand.
* [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]] as [[Jack McFarland]]: Will's other (and first gay) best friend since college. Jack is flamboyantly gay, confident, and free-spirited, having been so from a young age. He drifts from man to man and changes occupations often, being very fickle when it comes to both. He has worked as a struggling actor, an acting instructor, a back-up dancer for [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Janet Jackson]], a sales associate at [[Banana Republic]] and [[Barneys New York]], a cater-waiter, a student nurse, Junior VP for Out TV, and host of his own Out TV [[talk show]], called ''Jack Talk''. Jack made four one-man shows (called ''Just Jack'', ''Jack 2000'', ''Jack 2001'', and ''Jack 2002'') to showcase his singing/dancing/acting abilities; all attempts having only marginal success. Early on in the show he establishes a close friendship with Karen; the pair often spend time together and orchestrate various pranks. Throughout the series, Jack relies on Will and Karen for financial support. His idol is [[Cher]].
* [[Shelley Morrison]] as [[Rosario Salazar]] (recurring seasons 1–2; regular seasons 3–8): Karen's maid, and later Jack's wife, then ex-wife. Morrison was offered to reprise her role when the series was revived, but declined, having retired from acting.

===Conception===
Creators of ''Will &amp; Grace'' and real-life friends [[Max Mutchnick]] and [[David Kohan]] modeled the show after Mutchnick's relationship with childhood friend Janet Eisenberg, a [[New York City]] voice-over casting agent. Mutchnick, who is openly gay, met Eisenberg while rehearsing a play at [[Temple Emanuel (Beverly Hills, California)|Temple Emanuel]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]], at age of 13.&lt;ref name="jewjournal"&gt;{{cite web|first=Naomi|last=Pfefferman|title=Jewish and Normal? Oy!|work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]]|publisher=Rap-Up.com|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/television/article/jewish_and_normal_oy_20010907|accessdate=November 14, 2012|date=December 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the main star of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[school musical]], while she was a student in the drama department. About three years later, she introduced him to Kohan, the son of comedy writer [[Alan Kohan]], in the drama department at [[Beverly Hills High School]]. "Max and Janet seemed to have a lovely rapport, but the romantic element confused me, and it confused them as well," Kohan later recalled. "They went out for a couple of years, then they went off to different colleges. And Max [[Coming out|comes out of the closet]], springs it on her—and she was stunned. It was a shocking revelation for her, so I kind of functioned as a liaison between the two of them, because they both still really loved each other."&lt;ref name="jewjournal"/&gt;

While Kohan practiced his [[shuttle diplomacy]], he and Mutchnick began developing sitcom ideas, which prompted the pair to start writing as a duo.&lt;ref name="jewjournal"/&gt; They eventually landed staff jobs on [[HBO]]'s adult-themed sitcom ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]'' and executive produced the short-lived NBC sitcom ''[[Boston Common (TV series)|Boston Common]]''.&lt;ref name="jewjournal"/&gt; In 1997, they developed an ensemble comedy about six friends, two of them based on Mutchnick and Eisenberg.&lt;ref name="jewjournal"/&gt; At the same time, [[Warren Littlefield]], the then-president of [[NBC]] Entertainment, was seeking another relationship comedy for the network as ''[[Mad About You]]'' was going off the air.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;{{cite video | people=|date=2006|title=Will &amp; Grace: Series Finale – The Last Words: Interviews with the Cast|medium=DVD|publisher=Lions Gate Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="insidetheactors"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cast of Will &amp; Grace|work=[[Inside the Actors Studio]]|publisher=[[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX5QTGq3z5U |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kohan and Mutchnick pitched their idea, which centered on three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman, Littlefield was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted to learn more about the gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan were sent to create a pilot script centering on those two characters.&lt;ref name="insidetheactors"/&gt; While Kohan and Mutchnick elaborated on the pilot script, they spent four tense months faxing Littlefield the box office grosses from hit films with gay characters such as ''[[The Birdcage]]'' and ''[[My Best Friend's Wedding]]''.&lt;ref name="jewjournal"/&gt;

NBC was positive about the project, but there was still some concern that the homosexual subject matter would cause alarm. [[Ellen DeGeneres]]'s sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], was canceled the year before ''Will &amp; Grace'' premiered because ratings had plummeted after the show became "too gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/7230/will-grace-season-one/|title=Will &amp; Grace – Season One|last=Blair|first=David|date=August 13, 2003 |publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pink"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,270675,00.html |title=In The Pink|date=September 10, 1999|work=Entertainment Weekly|page=1|accessdate=April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the criticism ABC received for DeGeneres's [[coming out]] episode, "[[The Puppy Episode]]," Kohan said, "there's no question that show made it easier for ''Will &amp; Grace'' to make it on the air." He added: "''Will &amp; Grace'' had a better shot at succeeding where ''Ellen'' failed, however, because Will has known about his homosexuality for 20 years. He's not exploring that awkward territory for the first time, as Ellen did. The process of self-discovery and the pain most gay men go through is fascinating, but the average American is put off by it."&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite news|title=He's Gay, She's Not|last=Thompson|first=Kevin|date=September 21, 1998 |work=The Palm Beach Post |pages=1D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eric McCormack 2012 Shankbone 3.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Eric McCormack]] was the first actor cast in the series&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;]]
NBC went to sitcom director [[James Burrows]] to see what he thought of the homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show.&lt;ref name="DVD 2"/&gt; Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, "I knew that the boys had captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before."&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; The filming of the pilot began on March 15, 1998. The actors behind Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last long on television. McCormack said: "When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I were sitting on the couch and looking at each other and I said, 'We're gonna be on this set for a while.' And we sort of clasped hands, but we didn't want to say anything beyond that and jinx it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9053810/ |title=McCormack looks to end of 'Will &amp; Grace' |date=August 23, 2005|publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=May 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of Will Truman went to Eric McCormack, who was the first actor cast in the series.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0502/16/lkl.01.html|title=Interview with Cast of "Will &amp; Grace" |last=King|first=Larry |date=February 16, 2005|work=Larry King Live|publisher=CNN Transcripts|accessdate=April 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having played gay characters several times in his career, McCormack did not have a problem with it and thought his character could become a "poster boy for some gay movement", like DeGeneres became a spokesperson with her character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Time, Fine Line For Will &amp; Grace |last=Pergament |first=Alan|date=December 15, 1998 |work=The Buffalo News|pages=C5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sean Hayes was invited to audition for Jack after a NBC casting executive saw him in a role in the indie gay romance film ''[[Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss]]''. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away and decided not to try out for the audition until he was sent the script again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285421,00.html|title=Full-Mettle Jack |last=Baldwin|first=Kristen|date=October 23, 1998|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=April 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megan Mullally initially auditioned for the role of Grace Adler, but admitted that she did not want to audition for the part of Karen.&lt;ref name="DVD 3"&gt;{{cite video | people=|date=2003|title=Will &amp; Grace: Season One – Interviews with the Cast|medium=DVD|publisher=Lions Gate Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Debra Messing, with whom Mullally had first worked on ''[[Ned and Stacey]]'', was initially unsure if she wanted to play the role of Grace.&lt;ref name="daily news"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/09/28/1998-09-28_producers_poured_it_on_to_la.html |title=Producers Poured it on to Land 'Grace' They Came, They Drank, They Tipped the Deal in their Favor|last=Huff|first=Richard|date=September 28, 1998|work=Daily News (New York)|accessdate=April 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429155409/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/09/28/1998-09-28_producers_poured_it_on_to_la.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last actor to be cast, she later admitted that director Burrows was the reason for doing ''Will &amp; Grace''.&lt;ref name="DVD 2"&gt;{{cite video | people=|date=2003|title=Will &amp; Grace: Season One – Interviews with the Creators|medium=DVD|publisher=Lions Gate Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, NBC closed a deal for a new 10-episode season of the series, which aired during the 2017–18 season.

==Lawsuit==
In December 2003, in the midst of the series' sixth season, executive producers and creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick sued NBC and NBC Studios. Alleging that the network sold the rights to the series in an attempt to keep profits within the NBC family, Kohan and Mutchnick felt that they were cheated out of considerable profits because the network did not shop the show to the highest bidder. Another allegation against the network was that during the first four seasons of the series, the studio licensed the rights for amounts that were insufficient for covering production costs, thus leading to extraordinarily large production deficits.&lt;ref name="Producers of 'Will &amp; Grace' sue NBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-12-12-will-grace_x.htm|publisher=[[USA Today]]|title=Producers of 'Will &amp; Grace' sue NBC| date=December 16, 2003 | accessdate=March 22, 2008 | quote=The men, who created the show and wrote many of its episodes, accuse the two companies of failing to shop the show to the highest bidder, colluding instead to keep profits within the NBC family. General Electric owns both companies.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, NBC filed a countersuit against Kohan and Mutchnick stating that the co-creators were expected to act as an independent third party in the negotiations between NBC and its subsidiary, NBC Studios (since subsumed into [[Universal Television]]).&lt;ref name="NBC sues 'Will &amp; Grace' creators"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-05-will-grace-suit_x.htm|publisher=[[USA Today]]|title=NBC sues 'Will &amp; Grace' creators| date=March 5, 2004 | accessdate=March 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a pending lawsuit and production beginning on other projects, Kohan and Mutchnick were absent on the ''Will &amp; Grace'' set for most of its final seasons. They wrote the season 4 episode, "A Buncha White Chicks Sittin' Around Talkin'" and did not return to the writers' seat until the series finale four years later. Three years after NBC's countersuit and one year after the series ended, the legal battle between NBC and Kohan and Mutchnick ended in 2007 when all parties agreed on a settlement, with the series creators being awarded $49 million, of their original $65 million lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Surprise settlement in 'Grace' case"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ia76075fe469ef9a445bf8a470ba6059d |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |title=Surprise settlement in 'Grace' case |date=April 27, 2007 |accessdate=March 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915212437/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ia76075fe469ef9a445bf8a470ba6059d |archivedate=September 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndication==
''Will &amp; Grace'' entered off-network syndication in 2002. In 2002 [[WGN America]] acquired the cable rights to air the series, where it aired until 2005 when [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]] acquired the cable rights to air the series. After eight years and the expiration of Lifetime's contract, the rights to the series were picked up by [[WeTV]] and [[Logo TV]] in 2013, with both eventually letting the rights lapse.

The streaming service [[Hulu]] later picked up the show, in anticipation of the show's revival in 2017, with the entire series also carried on NBC.com. Around the same time, NBC's classic subchannel network [[Cozi TV]] picked up the series and airs it four times nightly, and promotes it as "The Original Series" to avert confusion with the current-day run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cozitv.com/shows/Cozi-Will--Grace-447739643.html|title=Will &amp; Grace|first=COZI|last=TV|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the series was aired on [[Channel 4]] up until its season finale in 2006. It was confirmed on 4 December 2017 that the series would premiere in January 2018 on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].

In Ireland, the series first aired on [[TV3 Ireland]] until its conclusion in 2006. It was confirmed in January 2018 rival channel [[RTÉ2]] picked up the broadcasting rights for the 2017–18 season run, beginning in February 2018.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The show garnered a fair amount of criticism and negative reviews upon its debut in 1998, most of which compared the show to the recently canceled [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''. Some called it "a gay ''[[Seinfeld]]''". One such review said, "If ''Will &amp; Grace'' can somehow survive a brutal time period opposite [[American football|football]] and ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', it could grow into a reasonably entertaining little anomaly—that is, a series about a man and a woman who have no sexual interest in one another. But don't bet on it. If it's doomed relationships viewers want, they'll probably opt for ''Ally''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Richmond| first = Ray| title = Will &amp; Grace | publisher = Daily Variety | url =http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_review/VE1117477856.html?nav=reviews | date=September 16, 1998 | accessdate=July 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As popular as the show came to be, particularly among gay viewers, ''Will &amp; Grace'' continuously dealt with criticism for having a limited view of the gay community and for reinforcing [[gay stereotypes|stereotype]]s when some felt it should have torn them down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =Watching with Ambivalence| publisher =Pop Matters Television| url =http://popmatters.com/tv/reviews/w/will-and-grace.html| date =October 3, 2000| accessdate =July 27, 2007| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070812204401/http://www.popmatters.com/tv/reviews/w/will-and-grace.html| archive-date =August 12, 2007| dead-url =yes| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series finale was heavily promoted by NBC, and McCormack, Messing, Mullally and Hayes appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' to bid farewell, on May 10 and 18, respectively. NBC devoted a two-hour block in its primetime schedule on May 18, 2006, for the ''Will &amp; Grace'' send-off. An hour-long series retrospective, "Say Goodnight, Gracie", featuring interviews with the cast, crew, and guest stars, preceded the hour-long series finale. Series creators and executive producers Kohan and Mutchnick, who had not served as writers since the season 4 finale, penned the script for "The Finale". Regarding the finale, Mutchnick stated, "We wrote about what you want to have happen with people you love... All the things that matter in life, they end up having."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Keveney| first = Bill| title = NBC's 'Will' bows out gracefully | work = [[USA Today]] | url =https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-05-17-will-grace-retrospective_x.htm |date=May 17, 2006 |accessdate=March 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ninth season was met with generally positive reviews. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the season has a rating of 86% based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Will &amp; Grace'' reunites its ever-hilarious cast for a revival season that picks up right where the show left off 11 years ago—adding a fresh relevance and a series of stories that make sharply funny use of the passage of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/will_grace/s09/|title=Will &amp; Grace: Season 9 (2017) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the season has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/will-grace-2017 |title=Will &amp; Grace reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and nominations===
{{Main article|List of awards and nominations received by Will &amp; Grace}}
[[File:Megan Mullally by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Megan Mullally]] received two Primetime Emmy Awards for her portrayal of Karen]]
''Will &amp; Grace'' has been nominated for 83 [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], winning 18 of them. McCormack, Messing, Hayes, and Mullally each won at least one Emmy Award for their respective performances. Mullally also won a second time for her performance in 2006, a year when ''Will &amp; Grace'' was nominated for 10 Emmys for its final season. The year before, the show had garnered 15 nominations, tied with ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as the series receiving the most nominations. This was almost an all-time record; the two shows were second behind ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', with 16 nominations in 1996.

With three each, both Hayes and Mullally held the record of winning the most [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s for the categories Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy Series and Best Performance by an Actress in a Comedy Series, respectively, for their roles in ''Will &amp; Grace''; however, [[Tina Fey]] went on to tie with Mullally and [[Alec Baldwin]] went on to surpass Hayes, both for their roles on the series ''[[30 Rock]]''. ''Will &amp; Grace'' has won several [[GLAAD Media Awards]] for its advocacy of the [[gay community]]. Despite more than two dozen nominations, ''Will &amp; Grace'' never won a [[Golden Globe Award]] during its original run.

===Ratings===
The show debuted on Mondays beginning on September 21, 1998, and steadily gained in popularity, culminating when it moved to Thursday night as part of NBC's [[Must See TV]] line-up. The show ultimately became a [[Nielsen ratings|highly-rated]] television show in the United States, earning a top-twenty rating during four of its eight seasons, including one season at # 9. From 2001–2005, ''Will &amp; Grace'' was the highest-rated sitcom among adults 18–49. However, when the show lost ''[[Friends]]'' as its lead-in after the [[2003–04 United States network television schedule|2003–04 season]], ''Will &amp; Grace'' began shedding viewers and slipped out of the top 20 during its last two seasons.

"[[The Finale (Will &amp; Grace)|The Finale]]" drew over 18 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = 'Will &amp; Grace' Helps NBC Stay Tough on Thursday | publisher = Zap2It | url =http://www.zap2it.com/tv/ratings/zap-ratings051806,0,2450059.story

While the season eight finale is considered a ratings success, it is far from being the most watched episode of ''Will &amp; Grace''—that accolade remains with the season four episode "[[A Chorus Lie]]", which aired on February 7, 2002, and ranked #8 for the week. When the show was at the height of its popularity (seasons 3–5), ranking in the Top 10 was a common occurrence, but the finale's Top 10 rank was the only such rank for season 8 and the first such rank since the season 7 premiere "FYI: I Hurt, Too".

===Cultural impact===
The series was the first prime-time television series on U.S. terrestrial television to star openly gay lead characters, making it the highest-profile presence of LGBT characters on U.S. broadcast television since [[Ellen (TV series)|''Ellen'']]'s eponymous lead character's [[coming out|coming-out]] in the 1997 "[[The Puppy Episode|Puppy Episode]]". It has also been heralded as responsible for opening the door to a string of gay-themed television programs, such as ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', ''[[Queer Eye|Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'', and ''[[Boy Meets Boy (TV series)|Boy Meets Boy]]''.

In May 2012, during a ''[[Meet the Press]]'' interview with host [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]], U.S. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] cited the series as an influence in American thinking regarding LGBT rights, saying, "I think ''Will &amp; Grace'' did more to educate the American public than almost anything anybody has ever done. People fear that which is different. Now they're beginning to understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/06/biden-says-he-is-absolutely-comfortable-with-same-sex-marriage/|title = Biden says he is 'absolutely comfortable' with same-sex marriage|date = May 6, 2012&lt;!--, 12:03 PM ET--&gt;|author = Jessica Yellin|publisher = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, Biden stated that he was "absolutely comfortable" with [[same-sex marriage]], a statement which was followed on May 9 by President [[Barack Obama]]'s speaking in favor of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/09/obama-gay-marriage_n_1503245.html|title=Obama Backs Gay Marriage|author=Sam Stein|date=May 9, 2012|access-date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after Obama's statement, series co-creator Mutchnick later told ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' that Biden had spoken similar words at a private function which Mutchnick and his husband had attended two weeks prior to Biden's statement, although a White House official was cited by ''CBS This Morning's'' [[Bill Plante]] as asserting that the ''Meet the Press'' interview was not a "trial balloon" for the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/barack-obama-gay-marriage-joe-biden-will-grace-max-mutchnick|title = 'Will &amp; Grace' Co-Creator Says Joe Biden Mentioned Show Prior to Gay Marriage Endorsement|date = May 10, 2012|author = Aaron Couch|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Mutchnick and Kohan praised Biden's statement, but were critical of Obama's stance on marriage during the time between Biden's and Obama's statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118053645|title = 'Will &amp; Grace' duo flattered by Biden shout-out|date = May 7, 2012|publisher = Variety|author = Ted Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the cast of the show were listed in [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]]'s ''100 Greatest TV Characters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Greatest_TV_Characters//index.shtml |title=Bravo &gt; 100 Greatest TV Characters |publisher=Bravo |accessdate=November 11, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QOBa5i9z?url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Greatest_TV_Characters//index.shtml |archivedate=July 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ranked ''Will &amp; Grace'' the ninth-best NBC comedy of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jen |last=Chaney|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/ranked-the-top-10-nbc-comedies-of-all-time/2012/09/10/9bb471e0-f90d-11e1-a073-78d05495927c_blog.html|title = Ranked: The top 10 NBC comedies of all time|date =October 9, 2012|work =[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, scripts, props, and set decor from ''Will &amp; Grace'' were donated to the [[National Museum of American History]], which is part of the Smithsonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/popnography/2014/08/20/original-transgender-pride-flag-will-grace-artifacts-smithsonian | title=Original Transgender Pride Flag, Will &amp; Grace Artifacts Donated to Smithsonian &amp;#124; Out Magazine | author=Out.com Editors | date=August 20, 2014 | access-date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs==

===''Karen: The Musical''===
It had been announced that Megan Mullally would be creating and starring in a new Broadway musical entitled ''Karen: The Musical''. This musical would have had Mullally reprising her role of Karen Walker. She stated in an interview that the show may also involve recurring guest star [[Leslie Jordan]] in his role as Beverley Leslie, with a story revolving around their rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/The_Return_of_Karen_Walker_in_KAREN_THE_MUSICAL_MetroSources_QA_with_Megan_Mullaly_20090916 |title=The Return of Karen Walker in KAREN: THE MUSICAL, MetroSource's Q&amp;A with Megan Mullally |publisher=Broadwayworld.com |date=September 16, 2009 |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mullally, the project was cancelled due to the rights to the Karen character being withdrawn. Mullally stated to have already gained approval from the network, as well as having the Broadway production company Fox Theatricals, director and choreographer [[Casey Nicholaw]] and composer [[Jeff Blumenkrantz]] all lined up to participate in the production, before certain stakeholders in the Karen Walker character withdrew the rights for its use in the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgsC7Gfy_Uk&amp;t=11m36s|title = Megan Mullally interview 2013 (in Aus)|date = 26 July 2013|website = YouTube|accessdate = 21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jack &amp; Karen''===
There had been talk in 2008 that a spin-off was being developed by NBC entitled ''Jack &amp; Karen'', featuring Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally reprising their roles. Hayes initially showed interest in the spin-off but was ultimately put off by the short-lived ''[[Friends]]'' spin-off, ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]''. Furthermore, Mullally's new work schedule in the form of her [[The Megan Mullally Show|talk show]], which was canceled several months later, did not allow her to pursue the spin-off at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystab.com/will-and-grace-spin-off-with-jack-and-karen|title=Will And Grace Spin-Off With Jack And Karen? » Entertainmentwise|date=October 4, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 Election web special===
On September 26, 2016, the main cast—McCormack, Messing, Hayes, and Mullally, plus Morrison in a cameo role—reunited for a 10-minute web special, urging Americans to vote in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="ABCnews2016electionreunion" /&gt; In the special, Karen, an avid [[Donald Trump]] supporter, tries to persuade Jack to vote for Trump, while Will and Grace, both avid [[Hillary Clinton]] supporters, try to persuade him to vote for Clinton. At the end, Will reveals that singer [[Katy Perry]] is a supporter of Clinton, which persuades Jack to vote for Clinton.

Women have been active participants in the development of [[radio]] (initially called "[[wireless]]") communications since its beginning. The age of [[radio communication]] began with the development of [[wireless telegraphy]] around 1900, in which [[Morse code]] could be transmitted over large distances using simple [[spark gap]] or [[carbon arc]] transmitting equipment, and various types of detectors for reception. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] achieved international fame in 1901 when he succeeded in sending a simple message in Morse code - the letter "s" - across the Atlantic from [[Cornwall]] in [[England]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

==Women as wireless operators==
Women had worked as [[telegraph]] operators since the late 1840s, and it was not long before women telegraphers began to work as wireless operators as well. In early 1901, the announcement of the inauguration of a Hawaiian inter-island communications system noted that four of the fourteen operators were women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047165/1901-02-02/ed-1/seq-1/ "Marconi's System Finally a Success"], ''Honolulu Republican'', February 2, 1901, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, Anna Nevins, who had worked as a telegrapher for [[Western Union]], began work as a wireless operator for [[Lee de Forest]]'s station "NY", located at 42 Broadway in [[New York City]].  She was later employed as a wireless operator at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, Louise R., "The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications." ''The A.W.A. Review,'' Volume 4, 1989, pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early female shipboard operators==
One of the earliest applications of wireless telegraphy was enabling communication between ships at sea and land stations.  While early ships' operators were mostly male, some women entered the field as well.  The primary requirement was a knowledge of Morse code and equipment operation, which many female telegraph operators possessed. Perhaps the earliest woman to operate on shipboard was Medora Olive Newell, an experienced telegrapher who was a passenger on the [[Cunard]] liner Slavonia in 1904, when Hungarian members of the [[Hague]] Peace Commission wished to send a birthday greeting to [[Emperor Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]].
Medora Olive Newell (1872 - December 31, 1946) began work as a telegraph operator in Durango, [[Iowa]], in 1886 at the age of fourteen.  In 1897, she moved to [[Chicago]] and became a commercial operator for the Postal Telegraph Company.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Medora O. Newell, ''Long Beach Independent'', Long Beach, CA, January 1, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Medora Olive Newell.jpg|thumb|right|Medora Olive Newell, Early Wireless Telegrapher. Source: ''Chicago Daily Tribune, '', February 13, 1907.]]
Newell’s first-class operator pay enabled her to live a fairly affluent lifestyle; as ''Telegraph Age'' reported in 1909, “Miss Newell has been in the habit of spending her vacations abroad, and has always made these trips the occasion for investigating telegraph and railway management and operation in European countries.”&lt;ref&gt;''Telegraph Age'', June 1, 1909, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; On her return voyage from Europe in 1904, she found herself aboard the Cunard liner Slavonia together with  members of the Hague Peace Commission, who were on their way to the United States to persuade President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to call another international conference to continue the work begun at the Hague in 1899.  The Hungarian members of the delegation wished to send a birthday greeting to Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary by wireless, but the ship’s wireless operator was unable to send the message.  Newell, who, according to ''Telegraph Age'', “had a good working knowledge of wireless,” took her place at the key and soon had successfully transmitted the greeting.  The grateful delegates thanked her for her assistance, and the secretary of the Hungarian parliament invited her to visit Hungary as the guest of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Jepsen, ''My Sisters Telegraphic'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Wireless Ship Act of 1910]] required US ships to be equipped with wireless equipment for the first time, and to have an operator on board who was capable of sending and receiving messages. The first woman to be officially employed as a shipboard wireless operator was Graynella Packer, a telegrapher from [[Jacksonville, Florida]], who was employed as a wireless operator for the [[United Wireless Telegraph Company]] aboard the steamship Mohawk from November 1910 to April 1911.&lt;ref name="feminine"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=The Feminine Wireless Amateur | work= The Electrical Experimenter| date=October 1916 | pages= 396–7, 452 | url=https://archive.org/details/electricalexperi04gern/page/396/mode/1up | accessdate= 2018-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Packer started practicing telegraphy in order to send messages in code to her school friends as a young girl.  She eventually took on telegraphy as a career because her eyes were not strong and 'handling a key is no strain on the sight'.&lt;ref&gt;(January 3, 1911).  [http://oceanlinersblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/St.-Petersburg-Evening-Independent-3-jan-1911.png Girl Wireless Operator]. Publisher: St. Petersburg (Florida) Evening Independent&lt;/ref&gt;  She became manager of the Postal Telegraph office in Sanford, Florida, before hiring onto the Mohawk as the first woman wireless operator to serve aboard a steamship in a commercial capacity.  After operating in full charge of the wireless, she eventually moved on to become an elected member of the Oklahoma State Bar Association from Oklahoma City in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;(1992)[https://books.google.com/books?id=wdg8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=graynella+packer&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=graynella%20packer&amp;f=false Proceedings of the Annual Meetings of the Oklahoma State Bar].

The [[Radio Act of 1912]] required radio operators in the U.S. to be licensed for the first time.  The first woman to be licensed as a shipboard operator was Mabelle Kelso, who passed the operator's examination and received her operating license in January 1912.&lt;ref name="operators"&gt;{{cite web | title= YL Amateur Radio Operators: 'Their Struggles and Achievements' | author= Elizabeth (VE7TLK/VA7TK)|work=qsl.net|date=2008| url= http://www.qsl.net/ylradio/archives/YLstor/images/YLSlideShow7.pdf | accessdate= 2018-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mabelle Kelso was a native of [[Seattle, Washington]], and had been previously employed as a stenographer.  After passing a [[U.S. Navy Department]] examination, she was hired by the United Wireless Telegraph Company and assigned a position as an operator on board the SS Mariposa, a steamship which travelled between Seattle and Alaska. Her appointment as shipboard operator generated some opposition from members of Congress who wished to bar women from holding such positions on seagoing ships; however, she received support from the Pacific Coast Wireless Inspector of United Wireless, who stated that "he knew of no law which would bar Miss Kelso from her position."&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Kelso of Seattle, Only Woman to Hold License as Wireless Operator," ''Atlanta Constitution'', July 7, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"May Flash Law On Wireless Girl," ''Oakland Tribune'', Oakland, California, July 25, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1913, over 30 women had been licensed as shipboard operators.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, "The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications," p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women as radio amateurs==
[[Amateur radio]] became a popular hobby in the early years of the twentieth century, and many hobbyists built their own transmitting and receiving equipment. Some of the earliest women radio amateurs, called "YLs," were Mrs. M.J. Glass of [[San Jose, California]], who operated as station FNFN in 1910, and Olive Heartburg, who operated as station OHK in [[New York City]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, "The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications," p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; M.S. Colville, of Bowmanville, [[Ontario]], who began to operate as XDD in 1914, was one of the earliest Canadian YLs.&lt;ref name="operators"/&gt;

The [[Radio Act of 1912]] also required radio amateurs to be licensed. [[Gladys Kathleen Parkin]] (September 27, 1901 - August 3, 1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= California Death Index, 1940 - 1997 |  work= Ancestry.com | url= http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi | accessdate= 2012-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the earliest women to obtain a government issued license. In 1916, while a fifteen-year-old high school student at the Dominican College in [[San Rafael, California]], she obtained a first class commercial radio operators' license with the call sign 6SO.
[[File:gladys kathleen parkin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gladys Kathleen Parkin]], 1916. Source: ''The [[Electrical Experimenter]]'', October 1916.]]

Parkin was quoted in an article titled "The Feminine Wireless Amateur," which appeared in the October 1916 issue of ''The Electrical Experimenter'':

"With reference to my ideas about the wireless profession as a vocation or worthwhile hobby for women, I think wireless telegraphy is a most fascinating study, and one which could very easily be taken up by girls, as it is a great deal more interesting than the telephone and telegraph work, in which so many girls are now employed. I am only fifteen, and I learned the code several years ago, by practising a few minutes each day on a buzzer. I studied a good deal and I found it quite easy to obtain my first grade commercial government license, last April. It seems to me that every one should at least know the code, as cases might easily arise of a ship in distress, where the operators might be incapacitated, and a knowledge of the code might be the means of saving the ship and the lives of the passengers. But the interest in wireless does not end in the knowledge of the code. You can gradually learn to make all your own instruments, as I have done with my 1/4 kilowatt set. There is always more ahead of you, as wireless telegraphy is still in its infancy."&lt;ref name="feminine"/&gt; Use of the term "YL" to refer to female radio amateurs was formally adopted by the [[American Radio Relay League]] in 1920.

==World War I and women as radio operators==
[[File:ww1 wireless women.jpg|thumb|right|Naval reservists training as wireless operators, 1916. Source: ''The Electrical Experimenter'', October 1916.]]
As the U.S. prepared to enter [[World War I]], the Navy Department began a program to train women as radio operators who could be called into action in the event of war.  The Girls' Division of the United States Junior Naval Reserve established training camps at the Martha Washington Post, in Edgewater, New Jersey, and the Betsy Ross Post, at Bay Ridge, [[Brooklyn]], where young women were trained to become wireless operators.&lt;ref name="feminine"/&gt;

In January 1917, the [[National League for Women's Service]] (NLWS) was created from the Woman’s Department of the National Civic Federation readiness and relief activities and modelled on similar groups in Britain and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=stevenson&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Shanna|title=National League for Woman’s Service: Minute Women of Washington|url=http://www.washingtonhistory.org/research/whc/milestones/aftersuffrage/minutewomen/nlws/|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National League of Women's Services|url=http://brooklynology.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/post/2010/07/29/National-League-of-Womens-Services.aspx|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The League was divided into thirteen national divisions, one of which was "Wireless and Telegraphy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Ida Clyde|author-link=Ida Clyde Clarke|title=American Women and the World War|date=1918|publisher=D.

==Women as broadcast radio engineers==
[[File:Violet McKenzie with wireless.png|thumb|right|[[Florence Violet McKenzie]] working with the wireless radio c1922]]
By 1920, the technology had evolved to the point where voice and music could be transmitted as well as Morse telegraphy, and several radio stations began to broadcast regular programs of music and news. In 1920, Eunice Randall (1898-1982), an employee of The American Radio and Research Company, or AMRAD, became an engineer and announcer for the AMRAD radio station, 1XE.  Her interest in radio had begun at the age of nineteen, when she built her own amateur radio equipment and operated with the call sign 1CDP. In addition to her technical duties at 1XE, which included repairing equipment and occasionally climbing the transmitting tower, she read stories for children as "The Story Lady," and gave the police report over the air.

In 1922, the AMRAD station changed its call sign to WGI. Eunice Randall remained as engineer and assistant chief announcer until 1925, when the company went bankrupt and the station was taken off the air.  However, she continued to work as an engineer and draftsman, and resumed her amateur radio activities under the call sign of W1MPP.&lt;ref name="operators"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Remembering the Ladies-- A Salute to the Women of Early Radio | author= Donna L.
