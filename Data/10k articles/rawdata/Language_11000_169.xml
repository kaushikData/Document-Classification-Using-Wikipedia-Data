In [[Book Publishing|book publishing]], an '''anthology''' is a collection of literary works chosen by the compiler. It may be a collection of poems, short stories, plays, songs, or excerpts by different authors. In [[genre]]&amp;nbsp;[[fiction]], ''anthology'' is used to categorize collections of shorter works such as [[short story|short stories]] and short [[novel]]s, by different authors, each featuring unrelated casts of characters and settings, and usually collected into a single volume for publication.

The complete collections of works are often called [[The Complete Works (disambiguation)|complete works]] or Opera Omnia ([[Latin language]] equivalent).

==Etymology==
The word entered the English language in the 17th century, from the [[Greek language#Greek loanwords in other languages|Greek]] word, ἀνθολογία (''anthologia'' "a collection of flowers"), a reference to one of the earliest known anthologies, [[Meleager of Gadara#The Garland of Meleager|the ''Garland'']] ({{lang|grc|Στέφανος}}), the introduction to which compares each of its anthologized poets to a flower. That ''Garland'' by [[Meleager of Gléagros of Gadara]]  formed the kernel for what has become known as the [[Greek Anthology]].

''[[Florilegium]]'', a Latin derivative for a collection of flowers, was used in medieval Europe for an anthology of Latin proverbs and textual excerpts. Shortly before anthology had entered the language, English had begun using  as a word for such a collection.

== Traditional ==
In [[East Asian]] tradition, an anthology was a recognised form of compilation of a given [[poetic form]]. It was assumed that there was a cyclic development: any particular form, say the ''[[Waka (poetry)|tanka]]'' in [[Japan]], would be introduced at one point in history, be explored by masters during a subsequent time, and finally be subject to popularisation (and a certain dilution) when it achieved widespread recognition. In this model, which derives from Chinese tradition, the object of compiling an anthology was to preserve the best of a form, and cull the rest.

In [[Malaysia]], an anthology (or ''antologi'' in [[Malay language|Malay]]) is a collection of ''syair'', ''sajak'' (or modern prose), [[prose]]s, [[drama]] scripts, and [[pantun]]s. Notable anthologies that are used in [[secondary school]]s include [[Education in Malaysia|''Sehijau Warna Daun'', ''Seuntai Kata Untuk Dirasa'', ''Anak Bumi Tercinta'', ''Anak Laut'' and ''Kerusi'']].

== Twentieth century ==

In the twentieth century, anthologies became an important part of poetry publishing for a number of reasons. For [[English poetry]], the [[Georgian poetry]] series &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Bridges (Independent Scholar) |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=470 |title=/ Bridges, James. Georgian Poetry. The Literary Encyclopedia. 31 July 2002 |publisher=Litencyc.com |date=2002-07-31 |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; was trend-setting; it showed the potential success of publishing an identifiable group of younger poets marked out as a 'generation'. It was followed by numerous collections from the 'stable' of some literary editor, or collated from a given publication, or labelled in some fashion as 'poems of the year'. Academic publishing also followed suit, with the success of the [[Quiller-Couch]] [[Oxford Book of English Verse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/101/ |title=Quiller-Couch, Arthur, ed. 1919. The Oxford Book of English Verse: 1250 - 1900 |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging other collections not limited to modern poetry. The concept of 'modern verse' was fostered by the appearance of the phrase in titles such as the [[Faber &amp; Faber]] anthology by [[Michael Roberts (writer)|Michael Roberts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faber.co.uk/tags/genre/Faber%20Anthologies/ Faber Anthologies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023716/http://www.faber.co.uk/tags/genre/Faber%20Anthologies/ |date=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the very different [[William Butler Yeats]] [[Oxford Book of Modern Verse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/y/w-b-yeats/oxford-book-of-modern-verse.htm/ Fantastic Fiction - Oxford Book of Modern Verse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104204431/http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/y/w-b-yeats/oxford-book-of-modern-verse.htm/ |date=November 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since publishers generally found anthology publication a more flexible medium than the collection of a single poet's work, and indeed rang innumerable changes on the idea as a way of marketing poetry, publication in an anthology (in the right company) became at times a sought-after form of recognition for poets. The self-definition of movements, dating back at least to [[Ezra Pound]]'s efforts on behalf of [[Imagism]], could be linked on one front to the production of an anthology of the like-minded. Also, whilst not connected with poetry, publishers have produced collective works of fiction from a number of authors and used the term anthology to describe the collective nature of the text. These have been in a number of subjects, including ''Erotica'', edited by [[Mitzi Szereto]] and ''[[American Gothic Tales]]'' edited by [[Joyce Carol Oates]].

In 2006 Azhagi was the recipient of the [[Manthan Award]] of India's Digital Empowerment Foundation and the [[World Summit Award|World Summit Award project]], in the category Localization.&lt;ref name="ManthanAward"&gt;{{Citation

  | archivedate = 2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Azhagi is the first successful Tamil transliteration tool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azhagi - the Easiest and Fastest Tamil transliterator - since 2000|url=http://mazhalaigal.com/tamil/software/0806akr_azhagi.php|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has lots of users throughout the world. Azhagi helps the user to create and edit contents in several Indian languages including [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Konkani]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]] and [[Assamese language|Assamese]] without having to know typing in these languages. Text of these languages can be produced only typing the phonetic equivalent of English. Azhagi can be embedded for direct typing text of these languages in applications apart from [[Microsoft Notepad|Notepad]], including Microsoft products like [[MS Office]],&lt;ref name="TheHindu01"/&gt; [[OpenOffice.org]] and also other applications all the [[web browser]]s.

Azhagi initially developed as a Tamil word processor having its own screen for typing contents in Tamil. The user can optionally select a dual screen or a single screen for transliteration. The Tamil text corresponding to the English text forming the phonetic equivalent of Tamil typed in the upper half of the screen is displayed in the lower half. This feature enables the user to ascertain the correctness of contents being typed. The single screen option can be chosen by users who have become familiar with the key mappings to be able to see larger portion of text than that seen in dual screen mode.

The mapping summary that lists the English alphabets to be typed to get every Tamil alphabet is presented in the form of a concise table in the Azhagi Screen. This guides the new user who is yet to become familiar with the key mappings in finding the correct for every alphabet. The text displayed in Azhagi screen is with [[TSCII]] encoding. A [[Unicode]] editor for typing Tamil text in [[UTF-8]] encoding with a separate display screen comes together with Azhagi.

Azhagi has another novel application known as Azhagi+ that enables wider range of settings and options to the user.

# Azhagi+ Enables typing in Indic languages in Windows XP in MS-Word, it doesn't require to enable Unicode explicitly.
# It gives Portable Support so that one can use it from pen-drive itself
# One can have one's own hotkey for any  LFK (Language + Font + Keyboard Layout combination) (no need to be dependent on F10 which may not work in laptops if function key configurations are changed)
# There is Dynamic in-built help for keymappings of all languages (no need to refer online help pages)
# One can change existing key mappings in any manner for any LFK (Language + [[Font]] + [[Keyboard layout|Keyboard]] Layout combination) in an easy and straightforward manner - quite unique among the [[Indic computing]]
# One can create one's own keyboard layout for any LFK.

== Android Version ==
In 2016, Azhagi has launched the Mobile App for Android users&lt;ref name="PlayStore"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azhagi.inputmethod.azhagi | title=Azhagi - Indic Typing Keyboard | publisher=Google | accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the custom transliteration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://azhagi.com/aa/maps/trans/tamil.html | title='Azhagi' Android App - Tamil Transliteration Scheme | accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; feature. Though this app is created based on Indic Keyboard, it supports both the transliteration and transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://azhagi.com/aa/ | title='Azhagi' Android App - 23 languages - SuperFast Tamil Transliteration - Free | accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://azhagi.com/aa/feats.html#top1 | title='Azhagi' android app - a class apart - Features | accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development team ==
[[B. Vishwanathan]], a software professional, developed Azhagi after he quit from [[Tata Consultancy Services]] due to illness. During 1999, the [[transliteration]] tools in Tamil had a lot of rough edges. Most importantly, it was not user-friendly. It was then, Viswanathan resolved to develop a user-friendly [[English language|English]]-to-[[Tamil Language|Tamil]] transliteration software. Later in 2000, Azhagi was released and he named the software Azhagi, to symbolise his wife's 'beautiful' heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Innovative, despite odds|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2003/11/11/stories/2003111100360300.htm|accessdate=22 April 2012 | location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu|date=11 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support from users ==
Lot of websites, software, documents which uses the Tamil font make use of the Azhagi and it has support from the user and they are displaying their thanks giving note on their blogs and web pages.&lt;ref name=Thanking-Azhagi&gt;{{cite web|title= Sundaram, Introduction and thanks to Azhagi|url=http://aaditya55.com/sundaram2.html|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the transliteration tool, Azhagi also provides links to hundreds of free Tamil fonts in [[Unicode]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100s of FREE Tamil Fonts (Unicode, Tscii, TAB, TAM, etc. encodings)|url=http://www.azhagi.com/freefonts.html|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TSCII]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TSCII file Description|url=http://aaditya55.com/sundaram2.html|publisher=TSCII|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAB and TAM format.
It is recommended by lot of users&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Any other tool like e-Kalappai for typing Tamil in all applications|url=http://www.higopi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=21|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its popularity is also increased gradually.

== Awards and recognition ==
* B. Vishwanathan was awarded the [[Manthan Award]] in 2006, for the development of dual screen transliteration tool Azhagi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manthan-AIF Award '06 &gt; Award Winners|url=http://manthanaward.org/section_full_story.asp?id=517|accessdate=17 May 2012|newspaper=The Manthan Award}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2004, [http://chennaionline.com chennaionline] described B. Vishwanathan as a computer expert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer Expert Vishwanathan |url=http://archives.chennaionline.com/health/hopeislife/07life07.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227032722/http://archives.chennaionline.com/health/hopeislife/07life07.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 December 2008 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |newspaper=Chennaionline.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; for his invention of Azhagi.
* In November 2004, [http://Nilacharal.com Nilacharal] described Vishwanathan as ''Thamizh Valarkkum Arignar'', which means, Tamil Developing Scholar for the invention of Azhagi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thamizh Valarkkum Arignar|url=http://www.nilacharal.com/tamil/specials/azhagi1_178.html|accessdate=17 May 2012|newspaper=Nilacharal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Banikanta Kakati''' was a prominent linguist, literary figure, critic and scholar in [[Assamese language]] with his immense contribution to the language in terms of literature, linguistics, cultural anthropology and comparative religion.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:     [[File:Banikanta Kakati.jpg|right|250px]] --&gt;

==Biography==

Banikanta Kakati was born in 1894 at Barpeta of Assam. He was the second son of his parents Lalitram Kakati and Lahobala. Kakati showed sign of his genius from his early childhood. In his school days he obtained 105 marks out of 100 in his Sanskrit answer book. It is also said that he could memorize the whole of [[Pāṇini]] in his school days.

*[[Kakati (Caste)]]

Kakati secured the highest position in English in [[Assam]] in his matriculation under the [[Calcutta]] University. 1913, he stood first amongst all the candidates in the intermediate from [[Cotton College, Guwahati|Cotton College]], [[Guwahati]] under the [[Calcutta University]]. He took first M.A. degree in [[English Literature]] from [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]], Calcutta in 1918. Later on he secured the first class first position in M.A. in [[English Language]] group in 1923 from Calcutta University.

Kakati joined Cotton College in 1918 as a professor of English until he became the principal of the College in 1947. He joined in Gauhati University in 1948 as the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Head of the Department of Assamese.

Kakati's health broke after the demise of his beloved wife Kanaklata in 1952 and died in the same year, on 15 November, the date of his birth.

==Literary career==

Soon after joining [[Cotton College, Guwahati|Cotton College]] as a lecturer in 1918, Banikanta Kakati took up the study of [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] and old [[Assamese literature]]. Soon, he was drawn into a controversy between two rival schools of Assam Vaishnavism. His erudite exposition of scriptural lore in the various issues of the Banhi under the pseudonym of Babananda Pathak, in defence of the values represented by the teachings of Sankardeva still makes fruitful reading.

While studying MA examination in [[English language|English]], he obtained his doctorate for his thesis – Assamese : Its Formation and Development in 1935. The publication of the thesis in 1941 was a god-send for the Assamese people who had been frantically struggling to establish the identity and provenance of their mother tongue. Kakati had to work far from the great centres of learning, in a place where even Leonard Bloomfields’ Language (1833) could not be made available. Yet the work was acclaimed by no lesser an authority than Dr Emeneau who found it ‘ground-breaking in many ways.’

His interest in language proliferated over the years, but meanwhile, his mind started straying into other fields and pastures new. He made an intensive study of the Kalita caste and incorporated his findings in ''Kalita Jatir Itibritta (1941)'', ''Mother Goddess Kamakhya (1948)'' deals with socio-religious issues prevalent in Ancient [[Kamarupa]]. Finally he turned his attention to Indian [[mythology]] and his [[Vaishnavite]] Myths and Legends has been acclaimed as 'one of the very few studies of the religious scene in India, produced by our scholars, that deserve reading and pondering over.'

Dr Kakati was one of the greatest critics that the country has produced. His ''Purani Asomiya Sahitya'' provides the axes for the appreciation of [[Vaishnavite]] literature of medieval Assam. He was certainly the most capable interpreter of religious mysticism in the poetry of the Nam Ghosha. He also raised the perennial issue of a possible tension between [[poetry]] and belief.

Himself a scion of the [[Romantic age]], Kakati sketched the critical background for the twentieth century Assamese romantics. The post-war decade in [[Assam]] is a decade of disenchantment. In this decade he also wrote on the contemporary situation which seemed to show that a great age was over and another was yet to be born. He died too early to see the achievements of the ensuing age.

==Books==

Banikanta Kakati's writings both in [[English language|English]] and [[Assamese language|Assamese]] mark a distinct achievement in the history of Assamese scholarship. As a critic of old and new literature in Assamese and as a writer on [[sociology]] and [[religious]] trends in medieval [[India]]-particularly [[Assam]], he set new standards.

{{Contains special characters}}

A '''bracket''' is a tall [[punctuation]] mark commonly used in matched pairs within text, to set apart or interject other text. The matched pair is best described as ''opening'' and ''closing''.&lt;ref&gt;''UAX #9: Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm'', {{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Paired_Brackets |title=3.1.3 Paired Brackets |access-date=24 April 2018 |website=unicode.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less formally, in a left-to-right context, it may be described as ''left'' and ''right'', and in a right-to-left context, as ''right'' and ''left''.

Forms include round (also called "parentheses"), square, curly (also called "braces"), and angle brackets (also called "chevrons"), as well as various other pairs of symbols.

In addition to referring to the class of all types of brackets, the unqualified word ''bracket'' is most commonly used to refer to a specific type of bracket: in modern American usage, this is usually the square bracket and in modern British usage, this is usually the round bracket.

== History ==

Chevrons (⟨&amp;nbsp;⟩) were the earliest type of bracket to appear in [[written English]]. [[Desiderius Erasmus]] coined the term ''lunula'' to refer to the rounded parentheses (), recalling the shape of the crescent [[moon]].&lt;ref&gt;Truss, Lynne. ''Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves'', 2003. p. 161. {{ISBN|1-59240-087-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names for various bracket symbols==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
Some of the following names are regional or contextual.

* (&amp;nbsp;) &amp;ndash; parentheses, brackets (UK, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and Australia), parens, round brackets, first brackets, or circle brackets
* {&amp;nbsp;} &amp;ndash; braces are "two connecting marks used in printing"; and in music "to connect staves to be performed at the same time"&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10th Edition, [[Oxford University Press]], Great Clarendon Street, Oxford OX2 2DP, UK&lt;/ref&gt; (UK and US), French brackets, curly brackets, definite brackets, swirly brackets, curly braces, birdie brackets, Scottish brackets, squirrelly brackets, gullwings, seagulls, squiggly brackets, twirly brackets, Tuborg brackets (DK), accolades (NL), pointy brackets, second brackets, fancy brackets, M Brace, moustache brackets.
* [&amp;nbsp;] &amp;ndash; square brackets, closed brackets, hard brackets, third brackets, crotchets,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, John. ''The Printer’s Grammar'' p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; or brackets (US)
* ⟨&amp;nbsp;⟩ &amp;ndash; pointy brackets, angle brackets, triangular brackets, diamond brackets, tuples, or chevrons
* &amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt; &amp;ndash; inequality signs, pointy brackets, or brackets. Sometimes referred to as angle brackets, in such cases as [[HTML]] markup. Occasionally known as broken brackets or "brokets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/B/broket.html |title=broket |publisher=Catb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ⸤ ⸥; ｢ ｣ &amp;ndash; corner brackets
* ⟦&amp;nbsp;⟧ &amp;ndash; double square brackets, white square brackets
* 〔&amp;nbsp;〕 &amp;ndash; tortoise shell brackets
* {{lang|fr|Guillemets}}, ‹&amp;nbsp;› and «&amp;nbsp;», are sometimes referred to as chevrons or [double] angle brackets, but are not used as brackets.&lt;ref name=msterm&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/language/en-us/Search.aspx?sString=chevron&amp;langID=de-de |title=Terminology Search - Microsoft |website=Microsoft Language Portal - Terminology Collection|date=  |author= |accessdate= 21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typography ==

The characters ‹&amp;nbsp;› and «&amp;nbsp;», known as {{lang|fr|[[guillemet]]}}s or angular quote brackets, are actually [[quotation mark]] [[glyph]]s used in several European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Manual for Writers and Editors|year=1998|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7C6V9zRxSPkC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;|isbn=0-87779-622-X}} At [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Which one of each pair is the opening quote mark and which is the closing quote varies between languages.

Similarly, the corner-brackets ｢&amp;nbsp;｣ are quotation marks used in East Asian languages (see [[Quotation mark#Chinese, Japanese and Korean quotation marks|Quotation mark § Chinese, Japanese and Korean quotation marks]]).

In English, typographers mostly  prefer to not set brackets in [[italics]], even when the enclosed text is italic.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bringhurst, ''The Elements of Typographic Style'', §5.3.2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other languages like German, if brackets enclose text in italics, they are usually set in italics too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forsmann |first1=Friedrich |last2=DeJong |first2=Ralf |date=2004 |title=Detailtypografie |trans-title=Detail Typography |language=German |location=Mainz |publisher= Herrmann Schmidt |page=263 |isbn= 978-3874396424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|parenthesis|( )}}

====Usage in writing====
Parentheses {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|θ|ᵻ|s|iː|z}} (singular, parenthesis {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|θ|ᵻ|s|ᵻ|s}}) (also called simply brackets, or round brackets, curves, curved brackets, oval brackets, stalls or, colloquially, parens {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|z}}) contain material that serves to clarify (in the manner of a [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]) or is aside from the main point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Straus|first=Jane|author-link=Jane Straus|title=Parentheses&amp;nbsp;— Punctuation Rules|url=http://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/parens.asp|work=The Blue Book of Grammar and Punctuation|publisher=grammarbook.com|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A milder effect may be obtained by using a pair of commas as the [[delimiter]], though if the sentence contains commas for other purposes, visual confusion may result.

In American usage, parentheses are usually considered separate from other brackets, and calling them "brackets" is unusual.

Parentheses may be used in formal writing to add supplementary information, such as "Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) spoke at length". They can also indicate shorthand for "[[uncertain plural|either singular or plural]]" for nouns, e.g. "the claim(s)". It can also be used for [[gender neutral language]], especially in languages with [[grammatical gender]], e.g. "(s)he agreed with his (her) physician".&lt;ref&gt;[[Slash (punctuation)#Gender-neutrality in Spanish and Portuguese]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parenthetical phrases have been used extensively in informal writing and stream of consciousness literature. Examples include the southern American author [[William Faulkner]] (see ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' and [[The Sound and the Fury#Part 2: June 2, 1910|the Quentin section of ''The Sound and the Fury'']]) as well as poet [[E. E. Cummings]].

Parentheses have historically been used where the [[Em dash|dash]] is currently used in alternatives, such as "parenthesis)(parentheses". Examples of this usage can be seen in editions of ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|Fowler's]]''.

Parentheses may be nested (generally with one set (such as this) inside another set). This is not commonly used in formal writing{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} (though sometimes other brackets [especially square brackets] will be used for one or more inner set of parentheses [in other words, secondary {or even tertiary} phrases can be found within the main parenthetical sentence]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fogarty|first=Mignon|title=Parentheses, Brackets, and Braces|url=http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/parentheses-brackets-and-braces.aspx|publisher=Quick and Dirty Tips|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Fix|text=not a reliable source}}

Any punctuation inside parentheses or other brackets is independent of the rest of the text: "Mrs. Pennyfarthing (What? Yes, that was her name!) was my landlady." In this usage, the explanatory text in the parentheses is a [[Parenthesis (rhetoric)|parenthesis]]. (Parenthesized text is usually short and within a single sentence. Where several sentences of supplemental material are used in parentheses the final [[full stop]] would be within the parentheses, or simply omitted. Again, the parenthesis implies that the meaning and flow of the text is supplemental to the rest of the text and the whole would be unchanged were the parenthesized sentences removed.)

In more formal usage, "[[Parenthesis (rhetoric)|parenthesis]]" may refer to the entire bracketed text, not just to the punctuation marks used (so all the text in this set of round brackets may be said to be "a [[parenthesis (rhetoric)|parenthesis]]", "a parenthetical", or "a parenthetical phrase").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/parenthetical |title=The Free Online Dictionary |publisher=[[Thefreedictionary.com]] |date= |accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Usage in enumerations====
===== Unpaired parenthesis =====
Lower-case [[Latin letters]] used as indexes, rather than [[bullet (typography)|bullet]]s or numbers, followed by an unpaired parenthesis, are used in ordered [[wiktionary:list|list]]s especially in:
#[[education]]al testing,
#technical writing and diagrams,
#[[market research]], and
#[[elections]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

====Usage as antisemitic symbol====
Since 2014, [[antisemite]]s have used [[triple parentheses]] around the names of people to denote them as Jewish.&lt;ref name=mic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleishman|first1=Cooper|last2=Smith|first2=Anthony|title=(((Echoes))), Exposed: The Secret Symbol Neo-Nazis Use to Target Jews Online|url=https://mic.com/articles/144228/echoes-exposed-the-secret-symbol-neo-nazis-use-to-target-jews-online|accessdate=4 June 2016|publisher=Mic|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Usage in mathematics====
Parentheses are used in [[mathematical notation]] to indicate grouping, often inducing a different [[order of operations]]. For example: in the usual order of algebraic operations, {{math|2 + 3 × 4}} equals 14, since the multiplication is done before the addition. However, {{math|(2 + 3) × 4}} equals 20, because the parentheses override normal precedence, causing the addition to be done first. Some authors follow the convention in mathematical equations that, when parentheses have one level of nesting, the inner pair are parentheses and the outer pair are square brackets. Example:

:&lt;math&gt;[(2 + 3) \times 4]^2 = 400.&lt;/math&gt;

A related convention is that when parentheses have two levels of nesting, curly brackets (braces) are the outermost pair. Following this convention, when more than three levels of nesting are needed, often a cycle of parentheses, square brackets, and curly brackets will continue. This helps to distinguish between one such level and the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.about.com/od/mathhelpandtutorials/fl/Parenthesis-Braces-and-Brackets.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140806203819/http://math.about.com/od/mathhelpandtutorials/fl/Parenthesis-Braces-and-Brackets.html |archivedate=6 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parentheses are also used to set apart the [[Parameter|argument]]s in mathematical [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s. For example, {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is the function ''{{math|f}}'' applied to the [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] ''{{math|x}}''. In [[coordinate system]]s parentheses are used to denote a set of coordinates; so in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] {{math|(4, 7)}} may represent the point located at 4 on the ''x''-axis and 7 on the ''y''-axis. 

Parentheses may also be used to represent a [[binomial coefficient]].

====Usage in programming languages====
Parentheses are included in the syntaxes of many [[programming languages]]. Typically needed to denote an argument; to tell the compiler what data type the Method/Function needs to look for first in order to initialise. In some cases, such as in [[LISP]], parentheses are a fundamental construct of the language.

====Usage in other scientific fields====
Parentheses are used in [[chemistry]] to denote a [[polyatomic ion]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} They can be used in various fields as notation to indicate the amount of [[uncertainty]]. For example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Info/Constants/definitions.html
 | title=Standard Uncertainty and Relative Standard Uncertainty
 | work=[[CODATA]] reference | publisher=[[NIST]] | accessdate=2018-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: 1234.56789(11)
is equivalent to:
: {{nowrap|1234.56789 ± 0.00011}}

==== Usage Online ====

Many online [[Roleplay]]ers use double parentheses to connotate out-of-character (OOC) messages that one may send another.

=== Square brackets {{Anchor|square bracket}} ===
{{Wiktionary|square bracket}}

====Usage in journalism====
Square brackets—also called crotchets or simply brackets (US)—are mainly used to insert explanatory material or to mark where a passage was omitted from an original material by someone other than the original author, or to mark modifications in quotations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th ed.'', [[The University of Chicago Press]], 2003, §6.104&lt;/ref&gt;

A bracketed [[ellipsis]], […], is often used to indicate omitted material: "I'd like to thank [several unimportant people] for their tolerance [...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/68/60/960.html |title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online -- Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more |work=bartleby.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524214802/http://www.bartleby.com/68/60/960.html |archivedate=24 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bracketed comments inserted into a quote indicate when the original has been modified for clarity: "I appreciate it [the honor], but I must refuse", and "the future of psionics [see definition] is in doubt". Or one can quote the original statement "I hate to do laundry" with a (sometimes grammatical) modification inserted: He "hate[s] to do laundry".

Additionally, a small letter can be replaced by a capital one, when the beginning of the original text is omitted for [[succinctness]], for example, when referring to a [[verbose]] original: "To the extent that policymakers and elite opinion in general have made use of economic analysis at all, they have, as the saying goes, done so the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination", it can be quoted succinctly as: "[P]olicymakers […] made use of economic analysis […] the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination." When nested parentheses are needed, brackets are used as a substitute for the inner pair of parentheses within the outer pair.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th ed.'', The University of Chicago Press, 2003, §6.102 and §6.106&lt;/ref&gt; When deeper levels of nesting are needed, convention is to alternate between parentheses and brackets at each level.

Alternatively, empty square brackets can also indicate omitted material, usually single letter only. The original "Reading is also a process and it also changes you." can be rewritten in a quote as: It has been suggested that reading can "also change[] you".

The bracketed expression "[''[[sic]]'']" is used after a quote or reprinted text to indicate the passage appears exactly as in the original source, where it may otherwise appear that a mistake has been made in reproduction.

In translated works, brackets are used to signify the same word or phrase in the original language to avoid ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th ed.'', The University of Chicago Press, 2003, §6.105&lt;/ref&gt;
For example: ''He is trained in the way of the open hand [karate].''

====Usage in proofreading====
Brackets (called ''move-left symbols'' or ''move right symbols'') are added to the sides of text in [[proofreading]] to indicate changes in indentation:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  style="width:15%; text-align:left;"| Move left
|  style="width:85%; text-align:left;"| [To Fate I sue, of other means bereft, the only refuge for the wretched left.
|-
!  style="width:15%; text-align:left;"| Center
|  style="width:85%; text-align:left;"| ]Paradise Lost[
|-
!  style="width:15%; text-align:left;"| Move up
|  style="width:85%; text-align:left;"| [[File:Quote to be Moved Up.svg|330px]]
|}

====Usage in scientific fields====
Brackets are used in [[mathematics]] in a variety of notations, including standard notations for [[commutator]]s, the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]], the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]], [[Equivalence class#Notation and formal definition|equivalence classes]], the [[Iverson bracket]], and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. Square brackets may also represent closed [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s; &lt;math&gt; [0,5] &lt;/math&gt; for example, represents the set of real numbers from 0 to 5 inclusive.

Brackets can also be used in [[chemistry]] to represent the [[concentration]] of a [[chemical substance]] or to denote distributed charge in a [[Complex (chemistry)|complex ion]].

Brackets are used in many computer [[programming language]]s, primarily to force the order of evaluation and for parameter lists and [[array data structure|array]] indexing. But they are also used to denote general tuples, sets and other structures, just as in mathematics. There may be several other uses as well, depending on the language at hand.

====Other uses====
In linguistics, [[phonetic transcription]]s are generally enclosed within brackets,&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th ed.'', The University of Chicago Press, 2003, §6.107&lt;/ref&gt; often using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], whereas [[phoneme|phonemic]] transcriptions typically use paired [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]]es. Pipes (| |) are often used to indicate a [[Morphophoneme|morphophonemic]] rather than phonemic representation. Other conventions are double slashes (// //), double pipes (|| ||) and curly brackets ({ }). In [[lexicography]], square brackets usually surround the section of a dictionary entry which contains the [[etymology]] of the word the entry defines.

Brackets are used to denote parts of the text that need to be checked when preparing drafts prior to finalizing a document. They often denote points that have not yet been agreed to in legal drafts and the year in which a report was made for certain [[case law]] decisions.

=== Curly brackets {{anchor|Braces|Curly bracket}} ===
[[File:Curly Bracket Notation.png|thumb|left|An example of when to use a curly bracket, in this case grouping multiple sentences together.]]
{{Wiktionary|curly bracket}}

Curly brackets '''{''' and '''}''' are also called '''braces''' in the United States (or, colloquially, '''squiggly brackets'''). They are rarely used in prose and have no widely accepted use in [[formal writing]], but may be used to mark words or [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s that should be taken as a group, to avoid confusion when other types of brackets are already in use, or for a special purpose specific to the publication (such as in a dictionary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/127892/are-curly-braces-ever-used-in-normal-text-if-not-why-were-they-created |title=Are curly braces ever used in normal text? If not, why were they created? |access-date=24 April 2018 |website=Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly, they are used to indicate a group of lines that should be taken together, as in when referring to several lines of poetry that should be repeated.

In music, they are known as [[accolade (notation)|accolade]]s or "[[brace (music)|braces]]", and connect two or more lines (staves) of music that are played simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decodeunicode.org/u%2B007B |title=&gt; U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACKET |website= Decodeunicode.org {{^|access-date=3 May 2009}} |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202121802/http://www.decodeunicode.org/u%2B007B |archive-date=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]] they delimit [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s, and in writing, they may be used similarly, "Select your animal {goat, sheep, cow, horse} and follow me". In many programming languages, they enclose groups of [[Statement (programming)|statement]]s and create a local [[Scope (computer science)|scope]]. Such languages ([[C (programming language)|C]] being one of the best-known examples) are therefore called [[curly bracket language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riedquat.de/prog/style |title=Brace and Indent Styles and Code Convention |work=riedquat.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924070732/http://www.riedquat.de/prog/style |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[classical mechanics]], curly brackets are often also used to denote the [[Poisson bracket]] between two quantities.

=== Angle brackets {{anchor|Chevrons}} ===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
{{redirect|Angle bracket|a device used for joining|Angle bracket (fastener)}}
{{Wiktionary|angle bracket|chevron}}

[[Wikt:chevron|Chevrons]] {{angbr|&amp;nbsp;}}, similar to the commonly used [[less-than sign|less-than]] (&lt;) and [[greater-than sign]] (&gt;), are often used to enclose highlighted material.

In physical sciences, chevrons are used to denote an average over time or over another continuous parameter. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle V(t)^2 \right\rangle = \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T}\int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} V(t)^2\,{\rm{d}}t. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[inner product]] of two vectors is commonly written as {{math|{{angbr|''a'',''b''}}}}, but the notation {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} is also used.

In mathematical physics, especially [[quantum mechanics]], it is common to write the inner product between elements as {{math|{{bra-ket|''a''|''b''}}}}, as a short version of {{math|{{bra|''a''}}·{{ket|''b''}}}}, or {{math|{{bra|''a''}}''Ô''{{ket|''b''}}}}, where {{math|''Ô''}} is an [[Operator (physics)|operator]]. This is known as Dirac notation or [[bra–ket notation]].

In [[set theory]], chevrons or parentheses are used to denote [[ordered pair]]s and other [[tuple]]s, whereas curly brackets are used for unordered sets.

In [[linguistics]], chevrons indicate [[grapheme]]s (i.e., written letters) or [[orthography]], as in "The English word {{IPA|/kæt/}} is spelled {{angbr|cat}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bauer|first1=Laurie|title=The Linguistics Student's Handbook|date=2007|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|location=Edinburgh|page=99|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsrtrmHkLvoC&amp;pg=PA99|chapter=Notational conventions. Brackets}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sampson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sampson|first1=Geoffrey|editor1-last=Allan|editor1-first=Keith|title=The Routledge Handbook of Linguistics|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=60|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vssCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|chapter=Writing systems: methods for recording language}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt;

In [[epigraphy]], they may be used for mechanical transliterations of a text into the Latin script.&lt;ref name="Sampson"/&gt;

In [[textual criticism]], and hence in many editions of pre-modern works, chevrons denote sections of the text which are illegible or otherwise lost; the editor will often insert their own reconstruction where possible within them.&lt;ref name="Trask"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trask|first1=Robert Lawrence|title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics|date=2000|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|page=22|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC&amp;pg=PA22|chapter=Angle brackets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chevrons are infrequently used to denote words that are thought instead of spoken, such as:
:{{angbr| What an unusual flower! }}

The mathematical or logical symbols for ''greater-than'' (&amp;gt;) and ''less-than'' (&amp;lt;) are [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] symbols; when either symbol is bisected by a vertical line, it represents "not greater than" or "not less than," respectively. These [[symbol]]s are not punctuation marks when used, as intended, to represent an inequality. However, as true chevrons are not present on [[computer keyboard]]s, the available less-than and greater-than symbols are often used instead. They are loosely referred to as ''angle[d] brackets'' or ''chevrons'' in this case, but more properly — and less confusingly — as ''pointy brackets'' (see the [[#Names for various bracket symbols|Names]] section above).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Single and double pairs of comparison operators (&amp;lt;&amp;lt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;) (meaning ''much smaller than'' and ''much greater than'') are sometimes used as a fallback instead of [[guillemet]]s («, ») (used as [[quotation mark]]s in many languages) when the proper characters are not available on the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] nor in the [[input method editor|input editor]]. Similarly, early Internet messaging conventions developed to use the ''greater-than'' sign (&amp;gt;), available in the [[ASCII#Character set|ASCII character set]], to mark quoted lines. This format, known as [[Usenet quoting]], is used by email clients when operating in [[plain text]] mode.

In [[comic book]]s, chevrons are often used to mark dialogue that has been translated notionally from another language; in other words, if a character is speaking another language, instead of writing in the other language and providing a translation, one writes the translated text within chevrons. Of course, since no foreign language is actually written, this is only ''notionally'' translated.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In [[continuum mechanics]], chevrons may be used as [[Macaulay brackets]].

In [[Quotation mark#Chinese, Japanese and Korean quotation marks|East Asian punctuation]], angle brackets are used as quotation marks. Chevron-like symbols are part of standard [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]] punctuation, where they generally enclose the titles of books: ︿ and ﹀ or ︽ and ︾ for traditional [[tategaki|vertical printing]], and 〈 and 〉 or 《 and 》 for [[yokogaki|horizontal]] printing.

=== Lenticular brackets ===
{{Wiktionary|【 】}}

Some [[East Asia]]n languages use lenticular brackets 【 】, a combination of square brackets and round brackets called {{lang|zh|方頭括號}} (''fāngtóu kuòhào'') in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and {{lang|ja|
すみ付き}} (''sumitsuki'') in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. {{clarify|text=They are used for inference in Chinese|date=April 2017}} and used in titles and headings in Japanese.

=== Floor and ceiling corners ===
{{Wiktionary|⌊ ⌋|⌈ ⌉}}
The floor corner brackets ⌊ and ⌋, the ceiling corner brackets ⌈ and ⌉ are  used to denote the integer [[floor and ceiling functions]].

=== Quine corners and half brackets ===

The Quine corners ⌜ and ⌝ have at least two uses in [[mathematical logic]]: either as [[quasi-quotation]], a generalization of quotation marks, or to denote the [[Gödel numbering|Gödel number]] of the enclosed [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]].

Half brackets are used in English to mark added text, such as in translations: "Bill saw ⸤her⸥".

In editions of [[papyrology|papyrological]] texts, half brackets, ⸤ and ⸥ or ⸢ and ⸣, enclose text which is lacking in the papyrus due to damage, but can be restored by virtue of another source, such as an ancient quotation of the text transmitted by the papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;M.L. West (1973) ''Textual Criticism and Editorial Technique'' (Stuttgart) 81.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Callimachus]] ''Iambus'' 1.2 reads: ἐκ τῶν ὅκου βοῦν κολλύ⸤βου π⸥ιπρήσκουσιν. A hole in the papyrus has obliterated βου π, but these letters are supplied by an ancient commentary on the poem. Second intermittent sources can be between ⸢ and ⸣.  Quine corners are sometimes used instead of half brackets.&lt;ref name="Unicode Miscellaneous Technical"/&gt;

=== Double brackets ===

Double brackets (or white square brackets), ⟦&amp;nbsp;⟧,  are used to indicate the ''semantic evaluation function'' in [[formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]] for natural language and [[denotational semantics]] for programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;Dowty, D., Wall, R. and Peters, S.: 1981, Introduction to Montague semantics, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, D. and Strachey, C.: 1971, Toward a mathematical semantics for computer languages, Oxford
University Computing Laboratory, Programming Research Group.&lt;/ref&gt; The brackets stand for a function that maps a linguistic expression to its “denotation” or semantic value. Double brackets may also refer to the mathematical [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]].

=== Brackets with quills ===

Known as "spike parentheses" ({{lang-sv|piggparenteser}}) ⁅ and ⁆ are used in Swedish dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:sv:Parentes]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific uses==

===Computing===

The various bracket characters are frequently used in many [[programming language]]s as [[operator (computer programming)|operator]]s or for other [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] markup. For instance, in [[C (programming language)|C]]-like languages, &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; are often used to delimit a [[code block]], and the parameters of [[method call]]s are generally enclosed by &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;.

In C, [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and other C-derived languages—as well as in [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]-influenced languages that have adopted C/Java syntax, such as [[JavaScript]]—the "&lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;" symbols are referred to as "braces" or "curly braces" and never as brackets. Since the term "brace" is documented in the definitive programming specifications for these languages, it is preferable to use the correct term brace so there is no confusion between the brace (used to denote compound statements) and the bracket, used to denote other concepts, such as [[array data structure|array]] indices.&lt;ref&gt;Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie. "The C Programming Language", 1988. p. 7. {{ISBN|0-13-110370-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bjarne Stroustrup, "The C++ Programming Language", 2013. p.39. {{ISBN|0-13-352285-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===
{{main|Bracket (mathematics)}}
In addition to the use of [[#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]] to specify the [[order of operations]], both parentheses and brackets are used to denote an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], also referred to as a half-open range. The notation {{closed-open|{{mvar|a}},{{mvar|c}}}} is used to indicate an interval from {{mvar|a}} to {{mvar|c}} that is inclusive of {{mvar|a}} but exclusive of {{mvar|c}}. That is, {{closed-open|5, 12}} would be the set of all real numbers between 5 and 12, including 5 but not 12. The numbers may come as close as they like to 12, including 11.999 and so forth (with any [[finite set|finite]] number of 9s), but 12.0 is not included. In some European countries, the notation {{math|[5, 12[}} is also used for this. The endpoint adjoining the bracket is known as ''closed'', whereas the endpoint adjoining the parenthesis is known as ''open''. If both types of brackets are the same, the entire interval may be referred to as ''closed'' or ''open'' as appropriate. Whenever [[Extended real number line|+∞]] or −∞ is used as an endpoint, it is normally considered ''open'' and adjoined to a parenthesis. See [[Interval (mathematics)]] for a more complete treatment.

In [[quantum mechanics]], chevrons are also used as part of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac's]] formalism, [[bra–ket notation]], to note vectors from the [[dual space]]s of the Bra&amp;nbsp;{{angbr|{{math|''A''&amp;#124;}} and the Ket&amp;nbsp;{{math|&amp;#124;''B''}}}}. Mathematicians will also commonly write {{angbr|{{math|''a'', ''b''}}}} for the [[inner product]] of two vectors. In statistical mechanics, chevrons denote ensemble or time average. Chevrons are used in [[group theory]] to write [[group presentation]]s, and to denote the [[group generators|subgroup generated]] by a collection of elements. Note that [[obtuse angle]]d chevrons are not always (and even not by all users) distinguished from a pair of less-than and greater-than signs &amp;lt;&amp;gt;, which are sometimes used as a [[typographic approximation]] of chevrons.

In [[group theory]] and [[ring theory]], brackets denote the [[commutator]]. In group theory, the commutator {{math|[{{mvar|g}}, {{mvar|h}}]}} is commonly defined as {{math|{{mvar|g}}&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; {{mvar|h}}&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; {{mvar|g}} {{mvar|h}} }}. In ring theory, the commutator {{math|[{{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}]}} is defined as {{math|{{mvar|a}} {{mvar|b}} − {{mvar|b}} {{mvar|a}} }}. Furthermore, in ring theory, braces denote the [[anticommutator]] where {{math|{{{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}}}} is defined as {{math|{{mvar|a}} {{mvar|b}} + {{mvar|b}} {{mvar|a}} }}. The bracket is also used to denote the [[Lie derivative]], or more generally the Lie bracket in any [[Lie algebra]].

Various notations, like the [[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] have a similar effect to brackets in specifying order of operations, or otherwise grouping several characters together for a common purpose.

In the [[Z notation|Z]] [[formal specification]] language, braces define a set and chevrons define a sequence.

===Accounting===
Traditionally in [[Accountancy|accounting]], contra amounts are placed in parentheses.  A debit balance account in a series of credit balances will have brackets and vice versa.

===Law===
Brackets are used in some countries in the citation of [[law report]]s to identify parallel citations to non-official reporters. For example: Chronicle Pub. Co. v. [[Superior Court]], (1998) 54 Cal.2d 548, [7 Cal.Rptr. 109]. In some other countries (such as [[England and Wales]]), square brackets are used to indicate that the year is part of the citation and parentheses are used to indicate the year the judgment was given. For example, National Coal Board v England [1954] AC 403, is in the 1954 volume of the Appeal Cases reports although the decision may have been given in 1953 or earlier, whereas (1954) 98 Sol Jo 176 reports a decision from 1954, in volume 98 of the Solicitor's Journal which may be published in 1955 or later.

When quoted material is in any way altered, the alterations are enclosed in brackets within the quotation. For example: Plaintiff asserts his cause is just, stating, "[m]y causes is [[sic|{{bracket|''sic''}}]] just." Although in the original quoted sentence the word "my" was capitalized, it has been modified in the quotation and the change signalled with brackets. Similarly, where the quotation contained a grammatical error, the quoting author signalled that the error was in the original with "[''sic'']" (Latin for 'thus'). (''California Style Manual'', section 4:59 (4th ed.))

===Sports===
[[Bracket (tournament)|Tournament brackets]], the diagrammatic representation of the series of games played during a tournament usually leading to a single winner, are so named for their resemblance to brackets or braces.

&lt;ref name="lang-rang"&gt;&amp;amp;lang; and &amp;amp;rang; were tied to the deprecated symbols U+2329 and U+232A in HTML4 and MathML2, but are being migrated to U+27E8 and U+27E9 for HTML5 and MathML3, as defined in [http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/#diff-xhtml1 XML Entity Definitions for Characters].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="301E"&gt;This is fullwidth version of U+2033 DOUBLE PRIME. In vertical texts, U+301F LOW DOUBLE PRIME QUOTATION MARK is preferred.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braces (curly brackets) first became part of a character set with the 8-bit code of the [[IBM 7030 Stretch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bob |first=Bemer |title=The Great Curly Brace Trace Chase |url=http://www.bobbemer.com/BRACES.HTM |accessdate =2009-09-05 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The angle brackets or chevrons at U+27E8 and U+27E9 are for mathematical use and Western languages, whereas U+3008 and U+3009 are for East Asian languages. The chevrons at U+2329 and U+232A are deprecated in favour of the U+3008 and U+3009 East Asian angle brackets. Unicode discourages their use for mathematics and in Western texts,&lt;ref name="Unicode Miscellaneous Technical" /&gt; because they are canonically equivalent to the CJK code points U+300x and thus likely to render as double-width symbols. The ''less-than'' and ''greater-than'' symbols are often used as replacements for chevrons.

{{wiktionary|brick}}
The word "'''brick'''", when used in reference to [[consumer electronics]], describes an electronic device such as a [[mobile device]], [[game console]], or [[router (computing)|router]] that, due to severe physical damage, a serious misconfiguration, corrupted [[firmware]], or a [[computer hardware|hardware]] problem, can no longer function, hence, is as technologically useful as a [[brick]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://android.gadgethacks.com/news/big-android-dictionary-glossary-terms-you-should-know-0165594/#jump-bricked|title=The Big Android Dictionary: A Glossary of Terms You Should Know|work=WonderHowTo|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term derives from the vaguely [[rectangle|rectangular]] shape of many electronic devices (and their [[AC adapter|detachable power supplies]]) and the suggestion that the device can function only as a lifeless, square object, [[paperweight]] or doorstop.

This term is commonly used as a verb. For example, "I bricked my [[digital audio player|MP3 player]] when I tried to modify its [[firmware]]." It can also be used as a noun, for example, "If it's corrupted and you apply using [[fastboot]], your device is a brick."

In the common usage of the term, "bricking" suggests that the damage is so serious as to have rendered the device dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/brick.html CATB.ORG Jargon File]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause and prevention==
Bricking a device is usually a result of interrupting an attempt to [[software update|update]] the device. Many devices have an update procedure which must not be interrupted before completion; if interrupted by a power failure, user intervention, or any other reason, the existing firmware may be partially overwritten and unusable. The risk of corruption can be minimized by taking all possible precautions against interruption.

Installing [[firmware]] with errors, or for a different revision of the hardware, or installing firmware incompetently [[software patch|patched]] such as DVD firmware which only plays DVDs [[DVD region code|sold in a particular region]], can also cause bricking.

Devices can also be bricked by [[malware]] (malicious software)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://superuser.com/questions/553230/is-it-possible-to-recover-a-bricked-computer|title=Is it possible to recover a bricked computer?|website=superuser.com|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes by running software not intentionally harmful but with errors that cause damage.

Some devices include two copies of firmware, one active and the other stored in fixed [[Read-only memory|ROM]] or writable [[non-volatile memory]] and not normally accessible to processes that could corrupt it, as well as a way to copy the stored firmware over the active version, even if corrupt, so that if the active firmware is damaged, it can be replaced by the copy and the device will not be bricked. Other devices have minimal "[[bootloader]]" firmware, enabled usually by operating a [[switch]] or [[jumper (computing)|jumper]], which does not enable the device to work normally but can reload the main firmware.

==Types==
Bricking is classified into two types, namely hard and soft, depending on the device's ability to function.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Hard brick===
Hard bricked devices generally show little to no signs of life. A hard bricked device does not power on or show any vendor logo; in essence, the screen remains turned off. Some of the major reasons for hard bricking are installing firmware not made for the device, interrupted flashing procedure or following a flashing procedure incorrectly.

Some other reasons include flashing a root file for a different file or using wrong commands. Some kernel bugs&lt;ref name="ICS Kernel bug"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.xda-developers.com/android/hard-brick-bug-on-galaxy-s-ii-and-note-leaked-ics-kernels/|title=Hard Brick Bug on Galaxy S II and Note Leaked ICS Kernels|date=2012-05-18|work=xda-developers|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been known that affect the ''/data'' partition in the eMMC chip, which gets corrupted during certain operations such as wiping and flashing.

Recovering from a hard brick is generally considered difficult and requires the use of a more direct programming interface to the controller; such an interface exists as there must be a way to program the initial firmware on an unprogrammed device. However, additional tools or connections may be needed.

Apart from that, there are different stages of a bricked device. There are different steps to resolve this issue and this includes: Analyzing the problem, also needs some changes on the PC, analyzing the process, and at which stage the hard brick device is. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dotandroid.com/android-root-guides/unbrick-qualcomm-mobiles/|title=Unbricking a Hard Bricked Android Device|last=|first=|date=|website=Dot Android|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soft brick===
A "soft bricked" device may show signs of life, but boots unsuccessfully or may display an [[Screen of death|error screen]]. Soft bricked devices can usually be fixed; for example, a soft bricked [[iOS]] device may display a screen instructing the user to plug it into a computer to perform an operating system recovery using [[iTunes]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263|title=If you can't update or restore your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch|work=Apple Support|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, Soft bricked devices are unable to be repaired without physical repairs being carried out; an example of this would be an iOS device locked with [[iCloud]] Activation Lock, of which the only solution is to contact the owner of the iCloud account the device is locked to, or to replace the entire [[motherboard]] with a non-locked board.{{Citation needed|reason=Not mentioned in previous Apple Support citation.|date=February 2018}}

==Unbricking==
Some devices that become "bricked" because the contents of their nonvolatile memory are incorrect can be "unbricked" using separate hardware (a debug board) that accesses this memory directly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo1973_Debug_Board_v2/Unbricking Neo1973 Debug Board v2/Unbricking - Openmoko]&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the procedure for loading firmware into a new device when the memory is still empty. This kind of "bricking" and "unbricking" occasionally happens during firmware testing and development. In other cases software and hardware procedures, often complex, have been developed that have a good chance of unbricking the device. There is no general method; each device is different. There are also user-created modifier programs to use on bricked or partially bricked devices to make them functional. Examples include the Wiibrew program [[BootMii]] used to fix semi-bricked Nintendo Wiis, the Odin program used to flash firmware on Samsung android devices,&lt;ref name = "unbrick.itcse.com"&gt;[http://unbrick.itcse.com/ Unbrick Android phones and tablets]&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Fastboot#Fastboot|fastboot Android protocol]] which is capable of reflashing a device with no software installed.&lt;ref name = "unbrick.itcse.com" /&gt;

A soft bricked [[Rooting (Android)|rooted]] [[Kindle Fire]] can be unbricked by using unrooting tools.

A personal computer may be unbricked by using [[System Restore]] or [[backup]].

==Systems==
In principle any device with rewritable firmware, or certain crucial settings stored into [[Flash memory|flash]] or [[EEPROM]] memory, can be bricked. Many, but not all, devices with user-updatable firmware have protection against bricking; devices intended to be updated only by official service personnel generally do not.

Amongst devices known to have bricking issues are: older PCs (more recent models often have dual [[BIOS]]es or some other form of protection), many [[mobile phone]]s, [[handheld game console]]s like the [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Nintendo DS]], [[video game console]]s like the [[Nintendo Wii]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]], many [[SCSI]] devices and some lines of [[hard disk drive]]s and [[Router (computing)|router]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

At least some older consumer market router models can become unresponsive when the user tries to define a [[subnet mask]] that does not contain one contiguous run of 1s and then 0s. If even a single bit is set so that it breaks one of the runs, the router may become bricked, unresponsive to any standard troubleshooting or resolving procedures listed in the manual. Unbricking the router may require opening the case, shorting some [[Jumper (computing)|jumper pins]] on the board, then connecting the router by the USB cable to an old PC with USB 1.1 hardware, running a special DOS level program supplied by the manufacturer, and powering the router up. This procedure will flash the router to factory settings and original firmware.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Electric cars such as the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]] can brick if the battery is completely discharged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jalopnik.com/5887265 Tesla Motors' Devastating Design Problem]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes an interrupted flash upgrade of a PC motherboard will brick the board, for example, due to a power outage (or user impatience) during the upgrade process. It is sometimes possible to unbrick such a motherboard, by scavenging a similar but otherwise broken board for a BIOS chip in the hopes that the BIOS will work even halfway, far enough to boot from floppy. Then it will be possible to retry the flash process. Sometimes it is possible to boot from a floppy, then swap the old presumably dead BIOS chip in and reflash it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r31285731-motherboard-Bricked-motherboard-after-bios-update|title=[motherboard] Bricked motherboard after bios update - Computer Hardware Help {{!}} DSLReports Forums|website=DSL Reports|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On some Gigabyte boards, it can also be possible to reflash the bricked main BIOS using a backup BIOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gigabyte.com/microsite/55/tech_081226_dualbios.htm|title=--GIGABYTE--DUAL BIOS WEB|website=www.gigabyte.com|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some vendors put the BIOS chip in sockets, allowing the corrupted BIOS chip to be removed and reprogrammed using an external tool, like a [[Programmer (hardware)|universal programmer]] or an [[Arduino]].

==Online and mobile services==
Many newer systems capable of accessing [[online service]]s (such as the [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[iPhone]]) have internal hardware-based unique identifiers, allowing individual systems to be tracked over a network and banned from accessing certain online services. Banned systems usually continue to operate for purposes unrelated to the online service, but they are often considered "bricked" by users of the online service.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Mobile telephones have a fixed identification code, the [[International Mobile Station Equipment Identity|IMEI]]; a telephone reported stolen can have its IMEI blocked by [[Cellular network|networks]]&amp;mdash;effectively bricked&amp;mdash;although anyone with the necessary expertise and equipment can usually change the IMEI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/crime/news/latest-news-mobile-thieves-now-change-imei-number-erase-memory-4907.html|title=Thieves can now change IMEI number}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[United States|US]] Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[New York (state)|NY]]) proposed that phones be "bricked" when reported stolen.&lt;ref name="helmbreck"&gt;Helmbreck, Valerie (2011-08-23). Senator wants stolen cellphones "bricked". Finance Tech News, 23 August 2011. Retrieved from http://www.financetechnews.com/senator-wants-stolen-cellphones-bricked/.&lt;/ref&gt; Some local police chiefs agreed.&lt;ref name="segraves"&gt;Segraves, Mark (2012-02-10).

Retrieved from http://www.wjla.com/articles/2012/02/mpd-fights-robbery-surge-seeks-new-fcc-rule-72491.html.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2013, this was rejected by mobile carriers because "If created, this capability would be in every handset and the 'kill' message would be known to every operator and therefore could not be kept secret," which could be an issue if it fell into the hands of someone with malicious intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itproportal.com/2013/11/20/mobile-carriers-pull-the-plug-on-anti-theft-kill-switch-for-smartphones/|title=Mobile carriers pull the plug on anti-theft 'kill switch' for smartphones|website=IT Pro Portal|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Un signari celtibèric oriental.jpg|thumb|250px|An eastern Celtiberian signary]]

The '''Celtiberian script''' is a [[paleohispanic scripts|Paleohispanic script]] that was the main [[writing system]] of the [[Celtiberian language]], an extinct [[Continental Celtic]] language, which was also occasionally written using the [[Latin alphabet]]. This script is a direct adaptation of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the most frequently used of the [[Iberian scripts]].

==Origins==
All the [[Paleohispanic scripts]], with the exception of the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]], share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic values for the [[stop consonant]]s, and monophonemic values for the rest of [[consonants]] and [[vowels]]. They are thus to be classed as neither [[alphabets]] nor [[syllabaries]]; rather, they are mixed scripts normally identified as [[semi-syllabaries]]. There is no agreement about how the [[paleohispanic scripts|Paleohispanic semi-syllabaries]] originated; some researchers conclude that they derive only from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], while others believe the [[Greek alphabet]] was also involved.

==Tipology and variants==
The basic Celtiberian signary contains 26 [[sign (linguistics)|signs]] rather than the 28 signs of the original model, the [[northeastern Iberian script]], since the [[Celtiberians]] omitted one of the two [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] and one of the three [[Nasal consonant|nasals]]. The remaining 26 signs comprised 5 [[vowel]]s, 15 syllabic signs and 6 consonants (one [[Lateral consonant|lateral]], two [[sibilants]], one rhotic and two nasals). The sign equivalent to Iberian ''s'' is transcribed as ''z'' in Celtiberian, because it is assumed that it sometimes expresses the fricative result of an ancient dental stop (''d''), while the Iberian sign ''ś'' is transcribed as ''s''. As for the use of the nasal signs, there are two variants of the Celtiberian script: In the eastern variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign ''ḿ'', while in the western variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign ''m''. This is interpreted as evidence of a double origin of the Celtiberian script. Like one variant of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the western variant of Celtiberian shows evidence{{which|date=March 2014}} of having allowed the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[Stop consonant|stops]] ''g'' and ''d'' to be differentiated from their respective [[voicelessness|voiceless]] counterparts, ''k'' and ''t'', by adding a stroke to the voiceless signs. This is known as the ‘dual system’ in Paleohispanic scripts, which otherwise do not distinguish between pairs of voiceless and voiced stops (''p:b, t:d'' and ''k:g'').

==Location of findings==
The Celtiberian inscriptions have been found mainly in the [[Ebro]] valley and near the sources of the [[Tagus]] and [[Douro]] rivers, where [[ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sources place the Celtiberian people. The Celtiberian inscriptions were made on different types of objects ([[silver]] and [[bronze]] [[coins]], [[ceramic]] receptacles, [[bronze]] plaques and [[tessera]]s, [[amphora|amphores]], stones, [[spindle (textiles)|spindle-whorls]], etc.). There are just under two hundred surviving inscriptions, one of which is exceptionally long: the third [[Botorrita]] bronze plaque ([[Zaragoza]]) with more than three thousand signs containing a census of nearly 250 people. Almost always the direction of the writing is left to right. The fact that nearly all the Celtiberian inscriptions were found out of archaeological context does not allow a precise chronology to be established, but it seems that the earliest inscriptions in the Celtiberian script date from the 2nd century BCE while the latest ones date from the 1st century BCE.

It is a kind of loan, or [[contract]], with one difference: the commodate is ''[[wikt:gratis|gratis]]'', and does not transfer the property; the thing must be returned in essence, and without deterioration, so that things which consume by use, or time, cannot be objects of a commodate, but of a loan, because although they may be returned in kind, they cannot in identity.

{{Platonism|dialogues=show}}
'''''Cratylus''''' ({{IPAc-en|k|r|ə|ˈ|t|aɪ|l|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Κρατύλος}}, ''Kratylos'') is the name of a dialogue by [[Plato]].  Most modern scholars agree that it was written mostly during Plato's so-called middle period.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 6, 13-14, [[David Sedley]], [http://assets.cambridge.org/052158/4922/sample/0521584922ws.pdf ''Plato's Cratylus''], Cambridge U Press 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the dialogue, [[Socrates]] is asked by two men, [[Cratylus]] and [[Hermogenes (philosopher)|Hermogenes]], to tell them whether names are "conventional" or "natural", that is, whether [[language]] is a system of arbitrary signs or whether words have an intrinsic relation to the things they signify.

==Summary==
The subject of Cratylus is ''the correctness of names'' (περὶ ὀνομάτων ὀρθότητος),&lt;ref&gt;F Ademollo (studied classics at the University of Florence and has held postdoctoral research positions at the University of Florence and at the Scuola Normale Superiore) - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=syap8s24tOkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cratylus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uw8UVc21LY2zae_MgPAD&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Cratylus&amp;f=false The Cratylus of Plato: A Commentary (p.I)] Cambridge University Press, 3 Feb 2011 {{ISBN|1139494694}} [Retrieved 2015-3-26]&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, it is a critique on the subject of naming (Baxter).&lt;ref&gt;T M.

In much the same way, the creator of words uses letters containing certain sounds to express the essence of a word's subject.  There is a letter that is best for soft things, one for liquid things, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;''Cratylus'' 431d.&lt;/ref&gt; He comments;&lt;ref&gt;''Cratylus'' 435c.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|the best possible way to speak consists in using names all (or most) of which are like the things they name (that is, are appropriate to them), while the worst is to use the opposite kind of names.}}

One countering position, held by Hermogenes, is that names have come about due to custom and convention. They do not express the essence of their subject, so they can be swapped with something unrelated by the individuals or communities who use them.&lt;ref&gt;''Cratylus'' 383a-b.&lt;/ref&gt;

The line between the two perspectives is often blurred.{{clarify|date=December 2011}} During more than half of the dialogue, Socrates makes guesses at Hermogenes' request as to where names and words have come from.  These include the names of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]], personified deities, and many words that describe abstract concepts. He examines whether, for example, giving names of "streams" to [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] (''Ροή'' – flow or space) are purely accidental.
{{quote|Don't you think he who gave to the ancestors of the other gods the names “Rhea” and “Cronus” had the same thought as Heracleitus? Do you think he gave both of them the names of streams (ῥευμάτων ὀνόματα) merely by chance?&lt;ref&gt;''Cratylus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0172%3Atext%3DCrat.%3Asection%3D402b 402b]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Greek term "ῥεῦμα" may refer to the flow of any medium and is not restricted to the flow of water or liquids.&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dr(eu%3Dma ῥεῦμα] at [[LSJ]]. Besides the flow liquids, "ῥεῦμα" may refer to the flow of [[sound]] ([[Epicurus]],Ep. 1p.13U), to the flow of fortune etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the words which Socrates uses as examples may have come from an idea originally linked to the name, but have changed over time. Those of which he cannot find a link, he often assumes have come from foreign origins or have changed so much as to lose all resemblance to the original word. He states, "names have been so twisted in all manner of ways, that I should not be surprised if the old language when compared with that now in use would appear to us to be a barbarous tongue."&lt;ref&gt;''Cratylus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Crat.+421d&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0172 421d]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final theory of relations between name and object named is posited by Cratylus, a disciple of [[Heraclitus]], who believes that names arrive from divine origins, making them necessarily correct.  Socrates rebukes this theory by reminding Cratylus of the imperfection of certain names in capturing the objects they seek to signify.  From this point, Socrates ultimately rejects the study of language, believing it to be philosophically inferior to a study of things themselves.

==Hades' name in Cratylus==
An extensive section of [[Plato]]'s [[Platonic dialogue|dialogue]] ''Cratylus'' is devoted to the etymology of the god's name, in which [[Socrates]] is arguing for a [[folk etymology]] not from "unseen" but from "his knowledge (''[[wikt:εἴδω|eidenai]]'') of all noble things". The origin of [[Hades]]' name is uncertain, but has generally been seen as meaning "The Unseen One" since [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. [[linguistics|Modern linguists]] have proposed the [[Proto-Greek]] form *''Awides'' ("unseen").&lt;ref&gt;According to Dixon-Kennedy, https://archive.org/stream/MikeDixonKennedy.......encyclopediaOfGrecoRomanMythologybyHouseOfBooks/MikeDixonKennedy.......encyclopediaOfGreco-romanMythologybyHouseOfBooks#page/n159/mode/2up p. 143] (following [[Karl Kerenyi|Kerényi]] 1951, p. 230) says "...his name means 'the unseen', a direct contrast to his brother Zeus, who was originally seen to represent the brightness of day". Ivanov, p. 284, citing Beekes 1998, pp. 17–19, notes that derivation of Hades from a proposed *''som wid-'' is semantically untenable; see also Beekes 2009, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attested form is ''Aḯdēs'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀΐδης}}), which lacks the proposed [[digamma]]. [[Martin Litchfield West|West]] argues instead for an original meaning of "the one who presides over meeting up" from the universality of death.&lt;ref&gt;West, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXrJA_5LKlYC&amp;pg=PA394  p. 394].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hades' Name in Classical Greek===
The {{IPAslink|w}} sound was lost at various times in various dialects, mostly before the classical period.

In [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], {{IPAslink|w}} had probably disappeared before [[Homer]]'s epics were written down (7th century BC), but its former presence can be detected in many cases because its omission left the [[meter (poetry)|meter]] defective. For example, the words [[Anax|ἄναξ]] "[[tribal king|(tribal) king]], lord, (military) leader".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/nac|ἄναξ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; found in the [[Iliad]], would have originally been {{lang|grc|ϝάναξ}} {{IPA|/wánaks/}} (and is attested in this form in Mycenaean Greek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John Chadwick|Chadwick, John]]|title=The Decipherment of Linear B |publisher=Second edition (1990). [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge UP]] |year=1958 |isbn=0-521-39830-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and {{lang|grc|οἶνος}} "wine" are sometimes used in the meter where a word starting with a consonant would be expected. Further evidence coupled with cognate-analysis shows that {{lang|grc|οἶνος}} was earlier {{lang|grc|ϝοῖνος}} {{IPA|/wóînos/}}&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|oi){{=}}nos1|οἶνος|ref}}:
:Ϝοῖνος [[Gortyn code|Leg.Gort.]] [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/main?url=oi%3Fikey%3D200508 col X.39]&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[Classical crete|Cretan]] [[Doric Greek|Doric]] ''ibêna'', cf. [[Latin]] ''vīnum'' and [[English language|English]] "wine").

==Appropriate sounds==
* ''ρ'' ('r') is a "tool for copying every sort of motion ([[wikt:κίνησις|κίνησις]])."&lt;ref&gt;Cratylus 426c-e.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="foot"&gt;e.g. ''rhein'' ('flowing'), ''rhoe'' ('flow'), ''tromos'' ('trembling'), ''trechein'' ('running'), ''krouein'' ('striking'), ''thrauein'' ('crushing'), ''ereikein'' ('rending'), ''thruptein'' ('breaking'), ''kermatizein'' ('crumbling'), ''rhumbein'' ('whirling').&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''ι'' ('i') for imitating "all the small things that can most easily penetrate everything",&lt;ref&gt;Cratylus 426e-427a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="foot"&gt;e.g. ''ienai'' ('moving'), ''hiesthai'' ('hastening').&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''φ'' ('phi'), ''ψ'' ('psi'). ''σ'' ('s'), and ''ζ'' ('z') as "all these letters are pronounced with an expulsion of breath", they are most appropriate for imitating "blowing or hard breathing".&lt;ref name="427a"&gt;Cratylus 427a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=foot&gt;e.g. ''psuchron'' ('chilling'), ''zeon'' ('seething'), ''seiesthai'' ('shaking'), ''seismos'' ('quaking').&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''δ'' ('d') and ''τ'' ('t') as both involve "compression and [the] stopping of the power of the tongue" when pronounced, they are most appropriate for words indicating a lack or stopping of motion.&lt;ref name="427a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="427b"/&gt;&lt;ref group=foot&gt;e.g. ''desmos'' ('shackling'), ''stasis'' ('rest').&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''λ'' ('l'), as "the tongue glides most of all" when pronounced, it is most appropriate for words denoting a sort of gliding.&lt;ref name="427b"&gt;Cratylus 427b.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=foot&gt;e.g. ''olisthanein'' ('glide'), ''leion'' ('smooth'), ''liparon'' ('sleek'), ''kollodes'' ('viscous').&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''γ'' ('g') best used when imitating "something cloying", as the gliding of the tongue is stopped when pronounced.&lt;ref name="427b"/&gt;&lt;ref group=foot&gt;e.g. ''glischron'' ('gluey'), ''gluku'' ('sweet'), ''gloiodes'' ('clammy').&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''ν'' ('n') best used when imitating inward things, as it is "sounded inwardly".&lt;ref name="427b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="427c"&gt;Cratylus 427c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=foot&gt;e.g. ''endon'' ('within'), ''entos'' ('inside').&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''α'' ('a'), ''η'' ('long e') best used when imitating large things, as they are both "pronounced long".&lt;ref name="427c"/&gt;&lt;ref group=foot&gt;e.g. ''mega'' ('large'), ''mekos'' ('length').&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''ο'' ('o') best used when imitating roundness.&lt;ref name="427c"/&gt;&lt;ref group=foot&gt;e.g. ''gongulon'' ('round').&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these are clear examples of [[onomatopoeia]], Socrates's statement that words are not musical imitations of the nature suggests that Plato didn't believe that language itself generates from sound words.&lt;ref&gt;Claramonte, Manuel Breva (1983). ''Sanctius Theory of Language: A Contribution to the History of Renaissance Linguistic''. John Benjamins Publishing, p. 24. {{ISBN|9027245053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platonic Theory of Forms==
Plato's [[theory of forms]] also makes an appearance. For example, no matter what a hammer is made out of, it is still called a "hammer", and thus is the ''form'' of a hammer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Socrates''': So mustn't a rule-setter also know how to embody in sounds and syllables the name naturally suited to each thing? And if he is to be an authentic giver of names, mustn't he, in making and giving each name, look to what a name itself is? And if different rule-setters do not make each name out of the same syllables, we mustn't forget that different blacksmiths, who are making the same tool for the same type of work, don't all make it out of the same iron. But as long as they give it the same form--even if that form is embodied in different iron--the tool will be correct, whether it is made in Greece or abroad. Isn't that so?&lt;ref&gt;''Cratylus'' 389d-390a1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plato's theory of forms again appears at 439c, when Cratylus concedes the existence of "a beautiful itself, and a good itself, and the same for each one of the things that are".&lt;ref&gt;''Cratylus'' 439c-d.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dahalik''' (ዳሃሊክ ''[haka (na)] dahālík'', "[language (of)] the people of Dahlak";&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Claude Simeone-Senelle: [http://llacan.vjf.cnrs.fr/fichiers/Senelle/Dahalik_shaebia05.pdf Dahālík, a newly discovered Afro-Semitic language spoken exclusively in Eritrea] (PDF), in: shaebia.org, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; also Dahaalik, Dahlik, Dahlak) is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language spoken exclusively in the [[Dahlak Archipelago]] in [[Eritrea]]. Its speech area is off the coast of [[Massawa]], on three islands in the Dahlak Archipelago: [[Dahlak Kebir]], [[Nora (island)|Nora]], and Dehil.

Dahalik belongs to the Afro-Asiatic family's [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch, a member of the Northern branch of the [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopic]] group, and is closely related to [[Tigre language|Tigre]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]. It is said to be not mutually intelligible with Tigre and, according to Simeone-Senelle, is sufficiently different to be considered a separate language.&lt;ref&gt;*Simeone-Senelle, Marie-Claude. 2000. 'Situation linguistique dans le sud de l'Erythrée', in Wolff/Gensler (eds) ''Proceedings of the 2nd World Congress of African Linguistics, 1997'', Köln: Köppe, p.&amp;nbsp;261–276.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are those who disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Idris, S. M. 2012. Dahalik: An Endangered Language or a Tigre Variety? ''Journal of Eritrean Studies'' 6 (1): 51–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status ==
Dahalik is spoken on the [[Dahlak Archipelago]], an island group belonging to Eritrea in the [[Red Sea]]. On the archipelago, most people are speakers of Dahalik with smaller populations of [[Arabic]] and [[Afar language|Afar]] native speakers. The situation is different for every village: Durrubishet and Dasquo have almost universal use of Dahalik, while other villages have a greater mix of languages. Most islanders are multilingual in Dahalik, Arabic, and Afar, while the language of education is Arabic. Most Dahalik men have regular contact with Arabic, Tigre, and Afar, and any mixed marriages usually result in the children learning two mother tongues. Dahalik speakers also consider their language to be a mix of Arabic, Tigre, and a small amount of Tigrinya. Overall, there are only a few elderly monolingual speakers of Dahalik. However, Dahalik speakers do have positive attitudes towards the language, and see it as an essential part of their cultural identity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/319729/filename/Eritrean_Studies_2005.pdf|title=A Survey of the Dahalik language, an Afro Semitic language spoken exclusively in Eritrea|last=Simeone-Senelle|first=Marie-Claude|date=|website=|publisher=HAL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The voiced uvular fricative /ʁ/ is the most common articulation of /q/ in the intervocalic position, while the voiceless uvular fricative /χ/ is used after a fricative. 
* The velar fricative /x/ and the voiced alveolar sibilant /z/ are only used in loanwords from Arabic.
* Except for /c/ in a few cases, there are no ejective consonants in Dahalik, and the degree of pharyngealization in /tʼ/ is weak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Dalpatram Dahyabhai Travadi''' ({{lang-gu|દલપતરામ ડાહ્યાભાઈ ત્રવાડી}})  ([[1820 in poetry|1820]]-[[1898 in poetry|1898]]) was a [[Gujarati language]] poet during 19th century in India. He was the father of [[Nanalal Dalpatram Kavi]], a poet.

==Life==
Dalpatram was born on 21 January 1820 at [[Wadhwan]] city of [[Surendranagar district]] in a [[Brahmin]] family. Dalpatram grew up to the resonant chanting of 'mantras' and recitations of religious scriptures. He was a child prodigy and displayed his extraordinary literary skills by composing 'hondulas' at the age of 12. He mastered the structures of rhyme, [[Poesias|poesis]] and 'Vrajbhasha' as a [[Swaminarayan (spiritual tradition)|Swaminarayan]] devotee under [[Brahmanand Swami]], and later moved to [[Ahmedabad]] at the age of 24.&lt;ref name="Gujarati Sahitya Parishad"&gt;{{cite web | title=સવિશેષ પરિચય: કવિ દલપતરામ , ગુજરાતી સાહિત્ય પરિષદ | website=Dalpatram Kavi, Gujarati Sahitya Parishad | url=http://www.gujaratisahityaparishad.com/prakashan/sarjako/savishesh/Savishesh-Dalpatram-Kavi.html | language=gu | accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalpatram died on 25 March 1898 at [[Ahmedabad]].&lt;ref name="Gujarati Sahitya Parishad"/&gt;

==Career==
Dalpatram was a [[Sanskrit]] scholar and poet.&lt;ref name="NatarajanNelson1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nalini Natarajan|author2=Emmanuel Sampath Nelson|title=Handbook of Twentieth-century Literatures of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lTnv6o-d_oC&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=16 February 2017|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-28778-7|page=100|chapter= Chapter-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dalpatram taught Gujarati language to [[Alexander Kinloch Forbes]], a British colonial administrator to [[Ahmedabad]]. Gujarati was considered at the bottom of language hierarchy during those times, so he preferred to write his poems in Brijbhasha instead of Gujarati, his mother tongue. Forbes encouraged him to write in Gujarati. Forbes and Dalpatram became close friends, and he inspired Dalpatram to write ''Laxmi Natak'' published in 1849, the first play in Gujarati, based on Greek drama [[Plutus (play)|Plutus]].&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/city/ahmedabad/Briton-inspired-Dalpatram-to-write-in-Gujarati-language/articleshow/30639604.cms|title =Briton inspired Dalpatram to write in Gujarati language|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=2014-02-22|accessdate=2014-02-22|last=Unnithan|first =Chitra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mukherjee1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sujit Mukherjee|title=A Dictionary of Indian Literature: Beginnings-1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCJrUfVtZxoC&amp;pg=PA83|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-1453-9|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Forbes, who wanted [[Gujarati literature]] to develop, had helped start the [[Gujarat Vernacular Society]]. He served as its first assistant secretary and started the ''[[Buddhiprakash]]'' periodical in 1850, editing it until 1878. When Forbes died in 1865, Dalpatram composed ''Farbesvirah'', a Gujarati elegy, and ''Farbesvilas'', his account of the gathering of bards, both dedicated to him.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt; At the end of the 19th Century He was entitled  ''Mahakavi'' (Great Poet) by [[Swaminarayan|Shahjanand Swami]], the founder of [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]].&lt;ref name="NatarajanNelson1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mukherjee1998"/&gt;

Unlike [[Narmad]], another prominent Gujarati poet of the same period, Dalpatram supported British rule for the benefits it gave India. Dalpatram also supported social reforms such as opposition to child marriage and allowing widows to remarry. Both Dalpatram and Narmad were the first Gujarati poets to address subjects connected to common life in their verses. Dalpatram's poems had subjects like English law, how to write an essay, and even "trees in a college compound". His verse often reflected his sense of humour.&lt;ref name="NatarajanNelson1996"/&gt;

Dalpatram was an authority on meters and wrote a treatise, ''Pingal'' ("Prosody"), which was used by scholars as a source book for many decades.&lt;ref name="NatarajanNelson1996"/&gt;

==Statue and Memorial==
[[File:Dalpatram Memorial - 2.JPG|thumb|Statue of Dalpatram at Lambeshwar ni Pol, [[Ahmedabad]]|left]]
In tribute to Dalpatram's work, AMC and citizens of Ahmedabad proposed a memorial at the site of his house, which was destroyed in 1985. With very few references or photographs available, it was very difficult to recreate the house. References were taken from the memories of residents and the architectural design of surrounding houses to create a memorial in the form of facade of the house and statue of Kavi Dalpatram in the year 2001.

In the year 2001, the memorial became a part of Heritage walk of Ahmedabad.
The design of statue was debated before they came up with the idea of Kavi in sitting posture with a book in his lap.

The statue is made of bronze and weighs 120&amp;nbsp;kg. Another key feature of the statue is the empty shoe of Kavi which is very dear to the children. The children call him 'Dada' or grandfather with love and have deep emotions attached to the statue.

The platform behind the statue displays the plan of the original house.The yellow stone on the floor indicates the walls, grey stone indicates the rooms and the black stone represents the open courtyard. The staircase is also marked with yellow stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd6CkE7dMUc |title=Kavi Dalpatram Memorial |date=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial also serves as a platform for community gatherings. His plays and recitations are also enthusiastically performed on various occasions including his birthday. The Heritage department has taken the responsibility of maintenance of the Dalpatram Memorial.&lt;ref name="Offensive 2013"&gt;{{cite web | title=Heritage walk revamp: Kavi Dalpatram Chowk gets facelift | website=The Times of India | date=2013-09-23 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Heritage-walk-revamp-Kavi-Dalpatram-Chowk-gets-facelift/articleshow/22905740.cms | accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
He was a progressive thinker and advocated the upliftment of oppressed classes and women's empowerment. He used his literary skills to bring about changes in society. At the end of the 19th century, he was entitled Mahakavi or the great poet by Shahjanand Swami, the founder of the Swaminarayan Sampraday.

Years have passed but the poems of Mahakavi still resonate in the hearts of people, inspiring them to move ahead in life, bringing peace to disturbed minds and questioning the social structure and system. Dada's poems also aim to teach moral values to the children through rich imagery and simple language.&lt;ref name="Gujarati Sahitya Parishad"/&gt;

The [[Kavishwar Dalpatram Award]] is named after him.

==Works==
His career spanned 6 books and 25 awards including drama, poems, songs, essays and articles. 'Hari Lila Amrut', 'Ven Charitra', 'Mithyabhiman' and 'Laxmi' are his major contributions.&lt;ref name="Blackburn2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart H.

{{Conservatism US}}
'''Family values''', sometimes referred to as '''familial values''', are [[tradition]]al or cultural [[values]] that pertain to the [[family]]'s structure, function, roles, beliefs, attitudes, and ideals.

In the social sciences and U.S. political discourse, the term "[[traditional family]]" refers to a nuclear family − a child-rearing environment composed of a [[breadwinner|breadwinning]] [[father]], a [[homemaking]] [[mother]], and their biological [[children]]; sociologists formerly referred to this model as the [[Social norm|norm]].{{fact|date=May 2018}} A family deviating from this model is considered a [[Non-traditional family|nontraditional family]].  However, in most cultures at most times, the [[extended family]] model has been most common, not the nuclear family,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2018/05/13/610777733/parenting-myths-and-facts Parenting Myths And Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; and the nuclear family became the most common form in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bebusinessed.com/history/history-nuclear-families/ History of Nuclear Families]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Several well-known online dictionaries define "family values" as the following:
* "the [[morality|moral]] and [[ethics|ethical]] principles traditionally upheld and passed on within a family, as honesty, loyalty, industry, and faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=family values|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/family+values|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "values especially of a traditional or [[Conservatism|conservative]] kind which are held to promote the sound functioning of the family and to strengthen the fabric of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=family values|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/family%20values|website=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "values held to be traditionally taught or reinforced within a family, such as those of high moral standards and discipline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=family values|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/family-values|website=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
{{Main|Familialism}}
[[Familialism]] or ''familism'' is the [[ideology]] that puts priority on [[family]] and family values.&lt;ref name=Ochiai&gt;{{cite book|title=Transformation of the Intimate and the Public in Asian Modernity. The Intimate and the Public in Asian and Global Perspectives|author=Emiko Ochiai, Leo Aoi Hosoya|publisher=BRILL|year=2014|isbn=9789004264359}} [url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JImIBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 Page 20-21]&lt;/ref&gt; Familialism prioritizes the needs of the family over the needs of individuals, and advocates for a welfare system where families, rather than the [[government]], take responsibility for the care of their members.&lt;ref name=Ochiai/&gt;

In the United States, the banner of "family values" has been used by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] to fight [[abortion]], [[LGBT rights|gay rights]], and major [[Feminism|feminist]] objectives in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dowland|first1=Seth|title=Family Values and the Rise of the Christian Right|date=2015|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812247602|url=to fight abortion, gay rights, and major feminist objectives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==
{{missing information|other cultures|date=November 2016}}

===Saudi culture===
Interpretations of [[Islam]]ic learnings and [[Arab culture]] are common for the majority of [[Saudi]]s. [[Islam]] is a driving cultural force that dictates a submission to the will of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peachy|first1=William S.|title=A brief look upon Islam|date=1999|publisher=Darussalam Publishers and Distributors|location=Riyadh, Saudi Arabia|pages=48|url=https://www.amazon.com/A-Brief-Look-Upon-Islam/dp/B00135EA0W|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic literature suggests that the family is regarded as the main foundation of Muslim society and culture; the family structure and nature of the relationship between family members are influenced by the Islamic religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mutair, A|author2=Plummer, V|author3=O'Brien, A|author4= Clerehan, R|authorlink1=Providing culturally congruent care for Saudi patients and their families|journal=Contemporary Nurse: A Journal For The Australian Nursing Profession|date=2014|volume=46|issue=2|pages=254–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage in Saudi culture means the union of two families, not just two individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Khalaf, I|author2=Callister, L|title=Cultural meanings of childbirth: Muslim women living in Jordan|journal=Journal of Holistic Nursing|date=1997|volume=4|issue=15|pages=373–388}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim society, marriage involves a social contract that occurs with the consent of [[parent]]s or guardians. Furthermore, marriage is considered the only legitimate outlet for [[sexual desire]]s, and sex outside marriage ([[fornication]]) is a crime that is punished under Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Lemu, A|author2=Heeren, F|title=Women in Islam|date=1992|publisher=The Islamic Foundation|location=Leicester, England|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of marriage is similar to the [[Western world|Western]] [[Christian]] view of marriage, created in 12th century [[France]], which promised [[salvation]], sex without sin, and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McDougall|first1= Sara|title= The Making of Marriage in Medieval France|journal=Journal of Family History|date= 2013|volume= 38|issue=2|pages= 103–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudi family includes extended families, as the [[extended family]] provides the individual with a sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. The father is often the [[:wikt:breadwinner|breadwinner]] and protector of the family, whereas the mother is often the [[homemaker]] and the primary caretaker of the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Luna|first1=J|title= Transcultural nursing care of Arab Muslims|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=1989|volume=1|issue=1|pages=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents are regarded with high respect, and children are strongly encouraged to respect and obey their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ghazwi, F.|author2= Nock, L.|authorlink1= Religion as mediating force in the effects of modernization on parent–child relations in Jordan|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=1989|volume=25|pages= 363–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, families provide care for elders. Until recently, because families and friends are expected to provide [[elderly care]], [[nursing home]]s were considered culturally unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luna|first1= J|title=Transcultural nursing care of Arab Muslims|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=1989|volume=1 |issue= 1|pages= 22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States culture===
In sociological terms, nontraditional families make up the majority of American households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Panasenko, N|title=Czech and Slovak Family Patterns and Family Values in Historical, Social and Cultural Context|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|date=2013|volume=44|issue=1|pages=79–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, only 46% of children in the U.S. live in a traditional family, down from 61% in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/22/less-than-half-of-u-s-kids-today-live-in-a-traditional-family/&lt;/ref&gt; This number includes only families with parents who are in their first marriage, whereas the percentage of children simply living with two married parents is 65% as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-192.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many who hold that the nuclear family is the fabric that holds society together&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bruderhof.com/en/our-faith/foundations/church-actions/marriage|title=Marriage|website=Bruderhof|language=en|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and work to promote stronger family values. The [[Chemin Neuf Community|Chemin Neuf]] community, the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Evangelical Alliance]] all work to promote the nuclear family.

The '''feminist sex wars''', also known as the '''lesbian sex wars''', or simply the '''sex wars''' or '''porn wars''', are terms used to refer to collective debates amongst [[feminism|feminists]] regarding a number of issues broadly relating to [[sexuality]] and [[sexual activity]].  Differences of opinion on matters of sexuality deeply polarized the feminist movement, particularly leading feminist thinkers, in the late 1970s and early 1980s and continue to influence debate amongst feminists to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atmore|first=Chris|title=Sexual Abuse and Troubled Feminism in Snakes and Ladders: Reviewing feminists at the centuries end.|year=2002|publisher=Routeledge|isbn=0415197996|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vpZ9wZ7W0r4C&amp;dq=when+did+the+feminist+sex+wars+end%3F}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The sides were characterized by [[Feminist views on pornography#Anti-pornography feminism|anti-porn feminist]] and [[Sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminist]] groups with disagreements regarding sexuality, including [[pornography]], [[erotica]], [[prostitution]], [[lesbian sexual practices]], the role of [[trans woman|trans women]] in the lesbian community, [[sadomasochism]] and other sexual issues. The feminist movement was deeply divided as a result of these debates.&lt;ref name=Duggan&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. | title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture | year=1995 | publisher=Routledge | location=New York  | isbn=0-415-91036-6 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hansen, Karen Tranberg |author2=Philipson, Ilene J. | title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader | year=1990 | publisher=Temple University Press | location=Philadelphia  | isbn=0-87722-630-X | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{Cite book | author=Gerhard, Jane F. | title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 | year=2001 | publisher=Columbia University Press | location=New York  | isbn=0-231-11204-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{Cite book | author=Leidholdt, Dorchen | authorlink= Dorchen Leidholdt |author2=Raymond, Janice G | title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism | year=1990 | publisher=Pergamon Press | location=New York  | isbn=0-08-037457-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{Cite book | author=Vance, Carole S | title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality | publisher=Thorsons Publishers| isbn=0-04-440593-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians view the feminist sex wars as having been the end of the [[second-wave feminist]] era (which began {{circa}} 1963) as well as the herald of the [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] (which began in the early 1990s).&lt;ref name="end"&gt;As noted in:

}}

The two sides became labelled [[Feminist views on pornography#Anti-pornography feminism|anti-pornography feminists]] and [[sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminists]].

=== Anti-pornography feminists ===
In 1976 [[Andrea Dworkin]] organized demonstrations against the film ''[[Snuff (film)|Snuff]] ''in New York, but attempts to start an organization to continue the feminist anti-pornography campaign failed. Efforts were more successful in [[Los Angeles]], where [[Women Against Pornography#Similar groups|Women Against Violence Against Women]] was founded in response to ''Snuff ''in 1976; they campaigned against the [[Rolling Stones]]' 1976 album ''[[Black and Blue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bronstein|first=Carolyn|title=Battling Pornography: The American Feminist Anti-Pornography Movement 1976-1986|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521879922|pages=88–97|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EYheMTwz2qIC&amp;dq=WAVPM+O'Farrell+theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. anti-pornography movement gained ground with the founding of [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]] (WAVPM) in 1977 in San Francisco, following a 1976 conference on [[violence against women]] held by local women's centers. Early members included [[Susan Griffin]], [[Kathleen Barry]], and [[Laura Lederer]]. 

WAVPM organised the first national conference on pornography in San Francisco in 1978 which included the first [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Currens|first=Elizabeth Gail|title=Performing Gender, Enacting Community|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=0549268707|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/?id=meCq4nEbmggC&amp;dq=Take+Back+the+Night+women+against+pornography+conference+1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference led to anti-pornography feminists organizing in New York in 1979 under the banner of [[Women Against Pornography]] (WAP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=The Sex Wars, 1970s to 1980s|url=http://www.outhistory.org/wiki/The_Sex_Wars,_1970s_to_1980s}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to similar organizations and efforts being created across the United States. In 1983, Page Mellish, a one-time member of WAVPM and of WAP, founded [[Feminists Fighting Pornography]] to focus on political activism seeking legal changes to limit the porn industry. Andrea Dworkin and [[Catharine MacKinnon]] wanted civil laws restricting pornography and to this end drafted the [[Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Demaske|first=Chris|title=Modern Power and Free Speech: Contemporary culture and issues of equality|year=2011|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0739127845|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OmpCiQ72PCwC&amp;dq=dworkin+laws+restricting+pornography}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the ''Dworkin-MacKinnon Ordinance''.

=== Sex-positive feminists ===
[[File:Ellen willis.png|thumb|160px|left|The term ''pro-sex feminism'' and, later, ''sex-positive feminism'' were inspired by Ellen Willis.&lt;ref name="Willis"/&gt;]]

From 1979 feminist journalist [[Ellen Willis]] was one of the early voices criticizing anti-pornography feminists for what she saw as sexual [[puritanism]], moral [[authoritarianism]] and a threat to [[free speech]]. Her 1981 essay, ''Lust Horizons: Is the Women's Movement Pro-Sex?'' is the origin of the term, "[[pro-sex feminism]]".&lt;ref name="Willis"&gt;Ellen Willis, [http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-10-18/specials/lust-horizons/ Lust Horizons: The 'Voice' and the women's movement], ''Village Voice'' 50th Anniversary Issue, 2007. This is not the original "Lust Horizons" essay, but a retrospective essay mentioning that essay as the origin of the term. Accessed online 7 July 2007. A lightly revised version of the original "Lust Horizons" essay can be found in ''No More Nice Girls'', pp. 3–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The response to the anti-pornography strand of feminism by the sex-positive feminists was one that promoted sex as an avenue of pleasure for women, seeing anti-pornography positions as aligned to the political right-wing's war on recreational sex and pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Meri Lisa|title=Third Wave Feminism and Television|year=2007|publisher=I.B. Taurus|isbn=1845112466|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/?id=naLP43BtYFAC&amp;dq=sex+wars+end+second+wave+feminism}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early sex positive groups included [[Samois]], founded in San Francisco in 1978, whose early members included [[Gayle Rubin]] and [[Pat Califia]], and the [[Lesbian Sex Mafia]], founded by [[Dorothy Allison]] and Jo Arnone in New York in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About us | url = http://lesbiansexmafia.org/about/ | website = lesbiansexmafia.org | publisher = Lesbian Sex Mafia | accessdate = 4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce]] (FACT) was set up in 1984 by Ellen Willis in response to the [[Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance|Dworkin-MacKinnon Ordinance]],&lt;ref name="Boffin 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boffin|first=Tina|title=Stolen Glances in Lesbian Subjects: A Feminist Studies Reader|year=1996|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253330602|page=121|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e0Kx1f3d-BcC&amp;dq=feminists+against+censorship+taskforce}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989 [[Feminists Against Censorship]] formed in the UK, its members including [[Avedon Carol]] and [[Feminists for Free Expression]] formed in the USA in 1992 with founding members including [[Veronica Vera]] and [[Candida Royalle]].

== Key events ==
In October 1980 the [[National Organisation for Women|National Organization for Women]] identified what became known as the "Big Four" through declaring that "[[Pederasty]], pornography, sadomasochism and [[public sex]]" were about "exploitation, violence or invasion of privacy" and not "sexual preference or orientation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promiscuous Affections: A Life in the Bar|url=http://www.rbebout.com/bar/1982a.htm|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more memorable clashes between the pro-sex and anti-porn feminists occurred at the [[1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality]]. Anti-pornography feminists were excluded from the events’ planning committee, so they staged rallies outside the conference to show their disdain.&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=Lesbian History|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/lesbian.history/the_sex_wars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debates ==
The two sides of the feminist sex wars clashed over a number of issues, resulting in intense debates held both in person and in various media.

=== Pornography debate ===
{{main article|Feminist views on pornography}}
Toward the end of the 1970s, much of the discourse in the feminist movement shifted from the discussion of [[lesbian feminism]] to focus on the new topic of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. One of the primary concerns with sexuality was the issue of [[pornography]], which caused a great divide among feminists. The two recognized sides of the debate were anti-pornography feminism and "pro-sex" feminism.&lt;ref name="sitemaker.umich"&gt;{{cite web|last=McBridge|first=Andrew|title=Lesbian History: The Sex Wars|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/lesbian.history/the_sex_wars|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major influences of [[anti-pornography feminism]] was its predecessor, lesbian feminism.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Anti-pornography movements developed from fundamental arguments displayed by lesbianism, such as the notion of patriarchal sexual relations.&lt;ref name="sitemaker.umich" /&gt; [[Ellen Willis]] described these relations as being "based on male power backed by force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willis|first=Ellen|title=In Powers of Desire: The Politics of Sexuality|year=1983|publisher=Monthly Review|location=New York City|pages=460–467}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, pornography is created exclusively for men by men and is a direct reflection of the man-dominant paradigm surrounding sexual relations.&lt;ref name="sitemaker.umich" /&gt; Another idea taken from lesbian feminism by anti-pornography groups was that sexuality is about creating a compassionate bond and a lasting relation with another person, contrary to the belief of the purely physical nature of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Anne|title=Signs|year=1984|pages=106–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book, ''Pornography: Men Possessing Women'', [[Andrea Dworkin]] argued that the theme of pornography is male dominance and as a result it is intrinsically harmful to women and their well-being. Dworkin believed that pornography is not only damaging in its production but also in its consumption, since the viewer will mentally internalize pornography's [[misogynistic]] portrayal of women.&lt;ref name="sitemaker.umich" /&gt; [[Robin Morgan]] summarized the view of anti-pornography feminists that pornography and [[violence against women]] are linked in her statement, "pornography is the theory, rape is the practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavalier|first=Robert|title=Feminism and Pornography|url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/Forum/pornography/background/CMC_article.html|publisher=CMU Philosophy Department Web Server|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-pornography movement has been criticised by [[sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminists]] as a repression of sexuality and a move towards censorship.&lt;ref name="sitemaker.umich" /&gt; In her article, ''Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality'', [[Gayle Rubin]] characterizes sex liberation as a feminist goal and denounces the idea that anti-pornography feminists speak collectively for all of feminism. She offers the notion that what is needed is a theory of sexuality separate from feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|title=Social Perspectives in Lesbian and Gay Studies|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=New York City|pages=100–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''XXX: A Woman's Right to Pornography'', [[Wendy McElroy]] summarizes the sex-positive perspective as "the benefits pornography provides to women far outweigh any of its disadvantages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|title=XXX: A Woman's Right to Pornography|year=1997|publisher=St Martin's Press|isbn=0312152450|url=https://books.google.com/?id=14jhGwAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pornography debate among [[Radical feminism|radical]] and [[Individualist feminism|libertarian feminists]] has focused on the depictions of female sexuality in relation to male sexuality in this type of media.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;Ferguson, A. 1984. "Sex War: The Debate between Radical and Libertarian Feminists." ''Chicago Journals''. 10 (1): 106–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical feminists emphasize that pornography illustrates objectification and normalization of sexual violence through presentation of specific acts.&lt;ref name="Ferguson" /&gt; In contrast, libertarian feminists are concerned with the stigmatization of sexual minorities and the limited right to practice sexual choice that would be hindered without pornography.&lt;ref name="Ferguson" /&gt;

=== Sadomasochism debate ===
{{main article|Feminist views on BDSM}}
The main locus of the sex wars' debate on [[sadomasochism]] and other [[BDSM]] practices was San Francisco. [[WAVPM|Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]] was founded there in 1977. Its first political action was to picket a live show at a strip club featuring women performing sadomasochistic acts on each other, in line with its stated aim to end all portrayals of women being "bound, raped, tortured, killed or degraded for sexual stimulation or pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bronstein|first=Carolyn|title=Battling Pornography: The American Feminist Anti-Pornography Movement 1976-1986|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521879922|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EYheMTwz2qIC&amp;dq=WAVPM+O'Farrell+theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as campaigning against pornography, WAVPM were also strongly opposed to [[BDSM]], seeing it as ritualized violence against women and opposed its practice within the lesbian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bronstein|first=Carolyn|title=Battling Pornography: the American Feminist Anti Pornography Movement 1976-1986|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1139498711|page=287|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYheMTwz2qIC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;lpg=PA287&amp;dq=wavaw+oppose+samois&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1UZ581KbuR&amp;sig=nzjFrJ8MqmopJ6nE5sKaEtc6F1k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=URoeUsfHDeam0wXh-oHACQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=wavaw%20oppose%20samois&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978 [[SAMOIS]] was formed, an organization for women in the BDSM community who saw their sexual practices as consistent with feminist principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Gayle S.|title=Deviations: A Gayle Rubin Reader|year=2011|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822349868|page=210|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BMlJ-REYViwC&amp;dq=samois+not+compatible+with+feminism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several black lesbian feminists have written on this topic, including [[Audre Lorde]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Darlene Pagano]], [[Karen Sims]], and [[Rose Mason]], condemning sadomasochism as an often racist practice, insensitive to the black female experience. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38535937|title=Chick flicks : theories and memories of the feminist film movement|last=Ruby.|first=Rich, B.|date=1998|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822321068|location=Durham|oclc=38535937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rich|first=B.

=== Prostitution debate ===
{{See also|Feminist views on prostitution}}
Another debate of the feminist sex wars centered on [[prostitution]]. The women in the anti-pornography camp argued against prostitution, claiming it is forced on women who have no other alternatives.{{POV statement|date=November 2015}} Meanwhile, [[sex-positive feminists]] argued that this position ignored the self-agency of women who chose [[sex work]], viewing prostitution as not inherently based on the exploitation of women. [[Carol Leigh]] notes that "The Prostitutes rights movement of the early 1970s evolved directly from the women's movement", but adds: "The women's movement in the U.S. has always been ambivalent about prostitutes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Carol |title=On the frontline of sex wars | journal = [[On the Issues (magazine)|On The Issues Magazine]] |url=http://www.ontheissuesmagazine.com/july08/july2008_10.php |publisher= [[Merle Hoffman]] | date = July 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polarized views of feminists on prostitution have affected their positions on the related issue of [[human trafficking]], which is frequently for the purpose of [[sexual exploitation]], with anti-prostitution feminists taking up the position of [[human trafficking|abolitionists]] and sex-positive feminists that of regulationists.&lt;ref name=Min_Liu&gt;{{cite book | last = Liu | first = Min | contribution = Human trafficking and feminist debates: Feminist debates on human trafficking | editor-last = Liu | editor-first = Min | title = Migration, prostitution, and human trafficking the voice of Chinese women | pages = 37–39 | publisher = Transaction Publishers | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-4128-4554-0 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WxG_2lxOWOAC&amp;pg=PA37 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
The polarization of feminist ideology during the sex wars has had wide-ranging effects. Examples include, according to Liu (2011), "The confusion in the interpretation of the definition of human trafficking is a consequence of opposing feminist views on prostitution."&lt;ref name=Min_Liu /&gt;

== Third-wave feminists' views ==
[[Third-wave feminism|Third-wave feminist]] writings promote personal, individualized views on the gender-related issues focused on during the feminist sex wars, such as prostitution, pornography and sadomasochism. In particular, the third-wave view of pornography is that there is no greater meaning other than which the actor or consumer gives it.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Items such as sex objects and porn, identified by some [[second wave feminism|second-wave feminists]] as instruments of oppression are now no longer being exclusively used by men but also by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Bridget J.|title=''The Third Wave's Break From Feminism''|publisher=''International Journal of Law in Context''|volume=6|issue=1|date=Mar 1, 2010|page=100|doi=10.1017/S1744552309990346|journal=International Journal of Law in Context|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}} (author prof. law, Pace Univ., N.Y.) (review)&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist critic [[Teresa de Lauretis]] sees the sex wars not in terms of polarized sides but as reflecting a [[Third-wave feminism|third wave feminism]] inherently embodying difference, which may include conflicting and competing drives.&lt;ref name="Code 2003 445"&gt;{{cite book |last=Code |first=Lorraine |title=Encyclopaedia of Feminist Theories |year=2003 |publisher=Rroutledge |isbn=0415308852 |page=445 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=EvDUSt-msIEC&amp;dq=feminist+sex+wars}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Lauretis |first=Teresa |title=Feminism and Its Differences |journal= Pacific Coast Philology |date=Nov 1990 |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=22–30 |url= http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/marilynm/Theorizing_Black_America_Syllabus_files/Feminism_and_its_Differences.pdf |accessdate= 7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, critic [[Jana Sawicki]] rejects both the polarized positions, seeking a third way that is neither morally dogmatic or uncritically libertarian.&lt;ref name="Code 2003 445"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18244">[[Gesture]]s are a form of [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal communication]] that include movements of the hands, arms, and/or other parts of the body. Children can use gesture to communicate before they have the ability to use spoken words and phrases. In this way gestures can prepare children to learn a spoken language, creating a bridge from pre-verbal communication to speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Words and Gestures: Infants' Interpretations of Different Forms of Symbolic Reference|journal = Child Development|date = 1998-04-01|issn = 1467-8624|pages = 295–308|volume = 69|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1998.tb06189.x|pmid = 9586206|language = en|first = Laura L.|last = Namy|first2 = Sandra R.|last2 = Waxman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The onset of gesture has also been shown to predict and facilitate children's spoken [[language acquisition]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwyn|first=Susan W.|last2=Acredolo|first2=Linda P.|last3=Brown|first3=Catherine A.|date=2000-06-01|title=Impact of Symbolic Gesturing on Early Language Development|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=81–103|doi=10.1023/A:1006653828895|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gesture is at the cutting edge of early language development|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027705000223|journal = Cognition|date = 2005-07-01|pages = B101–B113|volume = 96|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2005.01.001|first = Şeyda|last = Özçalışkan|first2 = Susan|last2 = Goldin-Meadow|pmid=15996556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once children begin to use spoken words their gestures can be used in conjunction with these words to form phrases and eventually to express thoughts and complement vocalized ideas.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Gestures not only complement language development but also enhance the child’s ability to communicate. Gestures allow the child  to convey a message or thought that they would not be able to easily express using their limited vocabulary. Children's gestures are classified into different categories occurring in different stages of development. The categories of children's gesture include deictic and representational gestures.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hand and Mind: What Gestures Reveal About Thought|last = McNeill|first = David|publisher = The University of Chicago Press.|year = 1992|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = 295–328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference between signs and gestures ==
Gestures are distinct from manual signs in that they do not belong to a complete language system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  For example, pointing through the extension of a body part, especially the index finger to indicate interest in an object is a widely used gesture that is understood by many cultures&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Learning to talk in a gesture-rich world: Early communication in Italian vs. American children|url = http://fla.sagepub.com/content/28/2/164|journal = First Language|date = 2008-05-01|issn = 0142-7237|pmc = 2744975|pmid = 19763226|pages = 164–181|volume = 28|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0142723707087736|language = en|first = Jana M.|last = Iverson|first2 = Olga|last2 = Capirci|first3 = Virginia|last3 = Volterra|first4 = Susan|last4 = Goldin-Meadow}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, manual signs are conventionalized—they are gestures that have become a lexical element in a language.  A good example of manual signing is [[American Sign Language]] (ASL)–when individuals communicate via ASL, their signs have meanings that are equivalent to words (e.g., two people communicating using ASL both understand that forming a fist with your right hand and rotating this fist using clockwise motions on the chest carries the lexical meaning of the word "sorry").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/s/sorry.htm|title="sorry" American Sign Language (ASL)|website=www.lifeprint.com|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deictic gestures ==
Typically, the first gestures children show around 10 to 12 months of age are deictic gestures. These gestures are also known as [[pointing]] where children extend their index finger, although any other body part could also be used, to single out an object of interest.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Deictic gestures occur across cultures and indicate that infants are aware of what other people pay attention to. Pre-verbal children use pointing for many different reasons, such as responding to or answering questions and/or sharing their interests and knowledge with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gesture and Multimodal Development|last = Vallotton|first = Claire|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing Co.|year = 2012|isbn = 9789027273925|location = Amsterdam|pages = 27–48|editor-last2 = Guidetti|editor-last = Colletta|editor-first = Jean-Marc|chapter = Support or competition? Dynamic development of the relationship between manual pointing and symbolic gestures from 6 to 18 months of age|editor-first2 = Michele}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main functions to infant's pointing:
# '''Imperative''' – this type of deictic gesture develops first and children use it to obtain something (the speech equivalent would be saying "give me that").
# '''Declarative''' – this type of deictic gesture develops later than imperative gestures and directs an adult's attention to an object or event to indicate its existence (the speech equivalent would be saying "look at that"). Declarative pointing is expressive and can be used by the child to draw attention to an interesting object and share this interest with another person. Declarative pointing can also be informative where the child is providing the other person with information. This type of gesture is typically absent in autistic children's gesture repertoires.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gesture and Multimodal Development|last = Cochet|first = Helene|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing Co.|year = 2012|isbn = 9789027273925|location = Amsterdam|pages = 7–26|editor-first = Jean-Marc|editor-last = Colletta|chapter = Pointing gesture in young children: Hand preference and language development|editor-last2 = Guidetti|editor-first2 = Michele|last2 = Vauclair|first2 = Jacques}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Epistemic''' – this type of deictic gesture also develops after imperative gestures and may develop at the same time as declarative gestures. These type of gestures serve as an [[Epistemology|epistemic]] request wherein infants may point to an object in order for an adult to provide new information, like a name, to an object (the speech equivalent would be saying "what is that").&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pointing as Epistemic Request: 12-month-olds Point to Receive New Information|journal = Infancy|date = 2014-11-01|issn = 1532-7078|pmc = 4641318|pmid = 26568703|pages = 543–557|volume = 19|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/infa.12060|language = en|first = Ágnes Melinda|last = Kovács|first2 = Tibor|last2 = Tauzin|first3 = Ernő|last3 = Téglás|first4 = György|last4 = Gergely|first5 = Gergely|last5 = Csibra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of deictic gestures that are declarative and [[Epistemology|epistemic]] in nature reflects another important part of children's development, the development of [[joint attention|joint visual attention]]. Joint visual attention occurs when a child and an adult are both paying attention to the same object.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Development of Sensory, Motor, and Cognitive Capacities in Early Infancy|last = Butterworth|first = George|publisher = Psychology Press Ltd.|year = 1998|isbn = 978-0-86377-512-3|location = United Kingdom|pages = 171–190|editor-last = Simion|editor-first = Francesca|editor-last2 = Butterworth|editor-first2 = George|chapter = What is special about pointing in babies?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint attention through the use of pointing is considered a precursor to speech development because it reveals that children want to communicate with another person.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Furthermore, the amount of pointing at 12 months old predicts speech production and comprehension rates at 24 months old.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Once children can produce spoken words they often use deictic gestures to create sentence-like phrases. These phrases occur when a child, for example, says the word "eat" and then points to a cookie. The incidence of these gesture-word combinations predicts the transition from one-word to two-word speech.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This shows that gesture can maximize the communicative opportunities that children can have before their speech is fully developed facilitating their entrance into lexical and syntactic development.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgenster, Aliyah; Caet, Stephanie; Collumbel-Leroy, Marie; Limousin, Fanny; Blondel, Marion.

Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Co. pp. 49–78. {{ISBN|9789027273925}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representational gestures ==
Representational gesture refers to an object, person, location, or event with hand movement, body movement, or [[facial expression]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From communication to language in two modalities|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0885201494900183|journal = Cognitive Development|date = 1994-01-01|pages = 23–43|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/0885-2014(94)90018-3|first = Jana M.|last = Iverson|first2 = Olga|last2 = Capirci|first3 = M. Cristina|last3 = Caselli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representational gestures can be divided into iconic and conventional gestures. Unlike deictic gestures, representational gestures communicate a specific meaning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gesturing in mother-child interactions|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885201499800185|journal = Cognitive Development|date = 1999-01-01|pages = 57–75|volume = 14|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/S0885-2014(99)80018-5|first = Jana M.|last = Iverson|first2 = Olga|last2 = Capirci|first3 = Emiddia|last3 = Longobardi|first4 = M.|last4 = Cristina Caselli}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children start to produce representational gestures at 10 to 24 months of age.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Young children create iconic gestures to inform others.|journal = Developmental Psychology|pages = 2049–2060|volume = 50|issue = 8|doi = 10.1037/a0037224|first = Tanya|last = Behne|first2 = Malinda|last2 = Carpenter|first3 = Michael|last3 = Tomasello|pmid=24979473|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young American children will produce more deictic gestures than representational gestures,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but Italian children will produce almost equal amounts of representational and deictic gestures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Iconic gestures ===

Iconic gestures have visually similar relationship to the action, object, or attribute they portray.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There is an increase in iconic gesturing after the two-word utterance stage at 26 months.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Children are able to create novel iconic gestures when they were attempting to inform the listener of information they think the listener does not know. Iconic gestures aided language development after the two-word utterance stage, whereas deictic gestures did not.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gestures in Language Development|last = Gullberg|first = Marianne|publisher = John Benjamins Pub. Co.|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Philadelphia|pages = 3–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iconic gestures are the most common form of representational gesture in Italian children.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Children will copy the iconic gestures they see their parents using,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; therefore including iconic gestures when measuring representational vocabularies increases Italian children's vocabularies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even though the Italian children produced more iconic gestures, the two-word utterance stage did not arrive earlier than American children who produce fewer iconic gestures.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Conventional gestures ===

Conventional gestures are culture-bound emblems that do not translate across different cultures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Culture]]-specific gestures such as shaking your head "no" or waving "goodbye" are considered conventional gestures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although American children do not typically produce many representational gestures in general, conventional gestures are the most frequently used in the representational gesture category.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Timeline of gesture development ==
Like most developmental timelines it is important to consider that no two children develop at the same pace. Infant [[gesture]] is thought to be an important part of the prelinguistic period and prepares a child for the emergence of language.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book

== Augmentative and alternative communication ==
Not only do gestures play an important role in the natural development of spoken language, but they also are a major factor in [[augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC).  AAC refers to the methods, tools, and theories to use non-standard linguistic forms of communication by and with individuals without or with limited functional speech.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Loncke, F. (2013). Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Models and applications for educators, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, caregivers, and users. San Diego, CA: Plural Publishing Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Means used to communicate in AAC can span from high-tech computer-based communication devices, to low-tech means such as one-message switches, to non-tech means such as picture cards, manual signs, and gestures.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  It is only within the last two decades that the importance of gestures in the cognitive and linguistic development processes has been examined, and in particular the gesture's functionality for individuals with communication disorders, especially AAC users.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3329">[[Image:Brosen bow ship.jpg|right|thumb|This photo shows the [[anchor]] chain running through a ship's hawsepipe]]
'''Hawsepiper''' is an informal [[merchant shipping|maritime industry]] term used to refer to a merchant ship’s officer who began his or her career as an unlicensed [[Merchant shipping|merchant seaman]] and did not attend a traditional [[list of maritime colleges|maritime college/academy]] to earn the officer license.  In the [[United States]], after accumulating enough sea time in a qualified rating, taking required training courses, and completing on-board assessments, the mariner can apply to the [[United States Coast Guard]] for a license as a [[Third Mate]] or [[Third Assistant Engineer]].  If approved the applicant must then pass a comprehensive license examination before being issued the license.

A ship’s hawsepipe is the pipe passing through the bow section of a ship that the [[anchor]] chain passes through.  Hawsepiper refers to climbing up the hawsepipe, a nautical [[metaphor]] for climbing up the ship's rank structure. This is in turn derived from the traditional British Naval usage of "came up through the [[hawsehole]]", referring to sailors who first entered the ship as [[Glossary of nautical terms|foremast jacks]] before becoming [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s, metaphorically by climbing up the hawser without great honor or respect, rather than being received directly onto the [[quarterdeck]].
There is also the phrase, "going down the hawse pipe" which is an officer who cannot find a ship's billet  and signs on as an ordinary seaman or wiper.
Several [[:Category:Maritime trade unions|merchant seamen's unions]] offer their membership the required training to help them advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seafarers.org/phc/courses/deck.xml | title=Deck Department | publisher=SIU | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021220194201/http://www.seafarers.org/phc/courses/deck.xml | archivedate=2002-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, some employers offer financial assistance to pay for the training for their employees.  Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training.

Since the requirements of [[STCW|STCW '95]] have been enacted there have been complaints that the hawsepiper progression path has been made too difficult because of the cost in time and money to meet formal classroom training requirements.  These critics assert that the newer requirements will eventually lead to a shortage of qualified mariners, especially in places like the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gulfcoastmariners.org/newsletters/HTML/november2004/november2004/november2004.htm | title=GCMA News Newsletter November 2004 Edition Number 26 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906194855/http://www.gulfcoastmariners.org/newsletters/HTML/november2004/november2004/november2004.htm | archivedate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. military rough equivalent to this term is [[Mustang (military officer)|mustang]].

'''Hobyot''' (Arabic: لغة هوبيوت , also known as Hewbyót, Habyot, or Hobi) is one of the six [[Modern South Arabian languages]] (MSAL), a group of [[South Semitic languages]] spoken in the southern [[Arabian Peninsula]]. A severely-endangered [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] language on the verge of extinction, it is spoken in a small area between [[Yemen]] and neighboring [[Oman]]. The speaking population is estimated to be about 1000 in Oman and 40 in Yemen, though the true number may be less.&lt;ref name="Simeone2"&gt;Simeone-Senelle, Marie-Claude. 2013. [https://www.academia.edu/5170551/MEHRI_AND_HOBYOT_SPOKEN_IN_OMAN_AND_YEMEN "Mehri and Hobyót spoken in Oman and in Yemen."] Sciences de l'Homme et de la Societe HAL.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its usage is less associated with a specific community or tribe of people, and more related to the geographical area in which it is spoken (the mountainous Dhufar/Yemen border).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://al-bab.com/albab-orig/albab/bys/articles/morris07.htm|title=British-Yemeni Society:The pre-literate, non-Arabic languages of Oman and  Yemen|website=al-bab.com|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the information regarding Hobyot's existence originated through the study of the more dominant, neighboring Modern South Arabian languages like [[Mehri language|Mehri]] and [[Shehri language|Jibbali]].  A clear linguistic description of Hobyot is difficult, as many speakers mix Mehri into their speech around outsiders.

In recent years, individual studies of Hobyot have provided sufficient evidence to prove its linguistic independence, and have given insight into the history and culture of its speakers. Documentation of its complete structure, however, has yet to be completed.

== History of documentation ==
Linguists first mentioned Hobyot in 1981 with a publication done by Thomas Muir Johnstone, though he initially discovered it in the 1970s. Johnstone hypothesized that it was actually a fusion of the more popular Mehri and Jibbali dialects of the MSAL rather than a definitive language in its own right. It would not be distinguished as its own language until 1985, when Marie-Claude Simeone-Sinelle published enough evidence to reveal distinction from its MSAL counterparts. It is now widely understood that a sufficient number of individual linguistic features has proved Hobyot's independence as its own language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lonnet|first=Antoine|date=1985-01-01|title=The modern South Arabian languages in the PDR of Yemen|jstor=41223029|journal=Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies|volume=15|pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that Hobyot speakers consider their language to be a mixture of Shahri and Mehri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=J. E.|date=2004-01-01|title=Oman's Diverse Society: Southern Oman|jstor=4330004|journal=Middle East Journal|volume=58|issue=2|pages=254–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; More documentation of the language is anticipated to arrive in the near future, as two modern research groups from the UK and France have been conducting field work in the hopes of shedding greater light on its nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lai8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA311&amp;lpg=PA311&amp;dq=hobyot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JuguU2plHh&amp;sig=1W1qjsDNt-gTiw-zSvGoClsO4xk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiprtDq0MTSAhXE6CYKHWwHDlU4ChDoAQg7MAc#v=onepage&amp;q=hobyot&amp;f=false|title=Semitic Languages in Contact|last=Butts|first=Aaron|date=2015-09-25|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004300156|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A preliminary detailing of some phonological and grammatical differences between Hobyot can be found in works done by Simeone-Senelle; specifically, in her work on its usage in Yemen and Oman.

== Geographic distribution ==
Given its location at the border of two countries, Hobyot is the shared language of people of differing origins. While speakers are mostly found on both sides of the mountainous border between Yemen and Oman,&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J., &amp; al-Mahri, A. (2016, April). Language, culture and the environment: Documenting traditional language and culture in Dhofar. In ''State of the Art Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences for Qatar and the Arab Gulf''. Leeds.&lt;/ref&gt; some can be found in desert areas to the north and west, as well as fishing communities on the coast. The misinterpretation of Hobyot as a part of either Mehri or Jibbali may stem from the fact that most Hobyot speakers came into contact with Jibbali speakers in the mountains, and Mahra speakers in the deserts and coastal areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hobyot speakers identify with the Mahra (Mehri) tribe, according to Hetzron's book on the Semitic languages. They are located within the Mehri area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simeone-Senelle|first=Marie-Claude|date=2010|title=Mehri and Hobyot Spoken in Oman and Yemen|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzrk0BKuVbA3YkZYRHNGelJZNTg/edit|journal=HAL Archives|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mountains, they breed camels, cows, and goats, while escaping in caves and settlements of roundhouses during the monsoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=aWhHAQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA378&amp;dq=thomas+johnstone+hobyot+language&amp;ots=3eoJGOVKxr&amp;sig=IwPKm6CKsa7v19PJfrgi5iKa1QA#v=onepage&amp;q=hobyot&amp;f=false|title=The Semitic Languages|last=Hetzron|first=Robert|date=2013-10-08|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136115806|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Hobyot speakers along the coasts are multilingual, and often have some understanding of Mehri or Mehriyot, even if they are not fluent. Influence by either Jibbali, Mehri,  or Mehriyot depends upon linguistic proximity. For example, Hobyot spoken in Yemen is closer to Mehriyot on the coast and Jibbali in the mountains.

== Endangerment ==
Hobyot is considered a critically endangered language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al Jahdhami|first=Said|date=October 2016|title=Minority Languages in Oman|url=|journal=Journal of the Association for Anglo-American Studies|volume=4|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual number of speakers is unknown, but it is estimated to be only a few hundred. Most of those who maintain the language are elderly, which adds to the likelihood that language extinction is near.

Ethnologue categorizes it as a moribund language (EGIDS 8a). The only fluent speakers that are left are older than the child-bearing age, which ultimately makes integration of the language into subsequent generations highly improbable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/cloud/hoh|title=Hobyót in the Language Cloud|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanisms of transmission would have to be created from outside the community in order to preserve it.

'''Humahuaca''' (Omaguaca) is an extinct and unclassified language of [[Argentina]] (Campbell &amp; Grondona 2012). Tribal and possibly dialect divisions were Fiscara, Jujuy, Ocloya, Osa, Purmamarca, and Tiliar. Mason (1950) proposed that Humahuaca was related to [[Diaguita language|Diaguita]] (Cacán) and [[Kunza language|Kunza]] in a group he called "Ataguitan", but modern sources leave it unclassified due to a lack of data.

'''Indian English''' refers to [[dialect]]s of the [[English language]] characteristic of the [[India|Republic of India]]. The [[Constitution of India]] designates the co-[[official language]] of the [[Government of India]] as English, along with [[Hindi]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ef.edu/epi/&lt;/ref&gt; Today many regional varieties of English, or Englishes, exist around the globe and are slowly but steadily gaining recognition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-seekho-hinglish-british-college-offers-course-on-hybrid-language/story-SoYv5GEJXbmBRNBwmmv32K.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of English in India==
[[Hindi]] is the official language of the Union [[Government of India]]. However, even after 70 years of [[Indian independence movement|Indian Independence from Britain]], English is still retained with a status of the "subsidiary" official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=2014-09-09|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few hundred thousand Indians, or less than 0.1% of the total population, have English as their first language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Census of India]]'s [http://www.censusindia.gov.in/ Indian Census] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514045222/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/ |date=14 May 2007 }}, Issue 25, 2003, pp 8–10, (Feature: Languages of West Bengal in Census and Surveys, Bilingualism and  Trilingualism).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/statement9.htm FAMILY-WISE GROUPING OF THE 122 SCHEDULED AND NON-SCHEDULED LANGUAGES] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207163559/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/statement9.htm |date=7 February 2013 }} – [[2001 Census of India]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tropf, Herbert S.  2005.

Siemens AG, Munich&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the distinction between "English Speakers," and "English Users," please see: TESOL-India (Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages)],  [http://tesol-india.ac.in/EnglishTeachingIndustry/en/india-worlds-second-largest-english-speaking-country India is World's Second Largest English-Speaking Country] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204102506/http://tesol-india.ac.in/EnglishTeachingIndustry/en/india-worlds-second-largest-english-speaking-country |date=4 December 2010 }}.  Their article explains the difference between the 350 million number mentioned in a previous version of this Wikipedia article and the current number: {{cquote|Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories – 'English Speakers' and 'English Users'. The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English.  The distinction becomes clear when you consider China's numbers. China has over 200 million that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only a few million are English speakers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[2001 Census of India|2001 Census]], 12.6% of Indians know English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/239073/these-four-charts-break-down-indias-complex-relationship-with-hindi/|title=These four charts break down India's complex relationship with Hindi}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the 2001 Census of India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-03-14/india/28117934_1_second-language-speakers-urdu |title=published in 2010 |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2010-03-14 |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that approximately 86 million Indians reported English as their second language, and another 39 million reported it as their third language.  No data were available whether these individuals were English speakers or users.

According to the 2005 [[India Human Development Survey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EF English Proficiency Index – A comprehensive ranking of countries by English skills|url=http://www.ef.com/epi/|website=www.ef.com|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 41,554 surveyed, households reported that 72% of men (29,918) did not speak any English, 28% (11,635) spoke at least some English, and 5% (2,077, roughly 17.9% of those who spoke at least some English) spoke fluent English. Among women, the corresponding percentages were 83% (34,489) speaking no English, 17% (7,064) speaking at least some English, and 3% (1,246, roughly 17.6% of those who spoke at least some English) speaking English fluently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Human development in india|journal = Oxford University Press|year = 2010|url = http://ihds.umd.edu/IHDS_files/HumanDevelopmentinIndia.pdf|author1 = Desai, Dubey|author2 = Joshi, Sen|author3 = Sharif, Vanneman|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211124532/http://www.ihds.umd.edu/IHDS_files/HumanDevelopmentinIndia.pdf|archivedate = 11 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to statistics of District Information System for Education (DISE) of [[National University of Educational Planning and Administration]] under [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]], [[Government of India]], enrollment in English-medium schools increased by 50% between 2008–09 and 2013–14. The number of English-medium school students in India increased from over 15 million in 2008–09 to 29 million by 2013–14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Number-of-children-studying-in-English-doubles-in-5-years/articleshow/49131447.cms|title=Number of children studying in English doubles in 5 years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India ranks 22 out of 72 countries in the 2016 [[EF English Proficiency Index]] published by the [[EF Education First]]. The index gives the country a score of 57.30 indicating "moderate proficiency". India ranks 4th out of 19 Asian countries included in the index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EF English Proficiency Index – India|url=http://www.ef.com/epi/regions/asia/india/|website=www.ef.com|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Asian countries, Singapore (63.52), Malaysia (60.70) and the Philippines (60.33) received higher scores than India.

===Court language===
English, according to the Indian Constitution, is the language of the Supreme Court and all the High Courts of India. The legal system in India is based on British Common Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/court-language-is-english-says-supreme-court/articleshow/50080870.cms|title=Court language is English, says Supreme Court|date=2015-12-07|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian parliament has the power to change this law, but it has yet to do so. However, in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan there is use of Hindi in courts because of Presidential approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/government-press-release/use-of-hindi-language-in-courts-116042801074_1.html|title=Use of Hindi Language in Courts|last=Delhi|date=2016-04-28|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Punjab and Haryana High Court also await Presidential approval for Hindi use as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/haryana-to-approach-guv-for-promoting-use-of-hindi-in-hc/articleshow/64848097.cms|title=Haryana to approach guv for promoting use of Hindi in HC - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Indian English generally uses the [[Indian numbering system]]. Idiomatic forms derived from Indian literary languages and vernaculars have been absorbed into Indian English. Nevertheless, there remains general homogeneity in phonetics, vocabulary, and phraseology between various dialects of Indian English.&lt;ref&gt;Mukesh Ranjan Verma and Krishna Autar Agrawal: ''Reflections on Indian English literature'' (2002), page 163: "Some of the words in American English have spelling pronunciation and also pronunciation spelling. These are also characteristic features of Indian English as well. The novels of Mulk Raj Anand, in particular, are full of examples of ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pingali Sailaja: ''Indian English'' (2009), page 116: "So what was Cauvery is now Kaveri. Some residual spellings left by the British do exist such as the use of ee for /i:/ as in Mukherjee. Also, some place names such as Cuddapah and Punjab"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Carney: ''Survey of English Spelling'' (2012), page 56: "Not all distributional differences, however, have important consequences for spelling. For instance, the ... Naturally enough, Indian English is heavily influenced by the native language of the area in which it is spoken."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Indian English Literature'' (2002), page 300: "The use of Indian words with English spellings: e.g. 'Mundus,' 'raksha'; 'Ed Cherukka,' 'Chacko Saar Vannu'"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
English language public instruction began in India in the 1830s during the [[Company rule in India#Education|rule of the East India Company]] (India was then, and is today, one of the most linguistically diverse regions of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lalmalsawma|first=David|title=India speaks 780 languages, 220 lost in last 50 years – survey|publisher=Reuters|date=7 September 2013|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2013/09/07/india-speaks-780-languages-220-lost-in-last-50-years-survey/}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  In 1835, English [[English Education Act 1835|replaced]] [[Persian language|Persian]] as the official language of the Company. [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]] played a major role in introducing English and western concepts to education in India. He supported the replacement of Persian by English as the official language, the use of English as the medium of instruction in all schools, and the training of English-speaking Indians as teachers.&lt;ref name="John MacKenzie 2013"&gt;John MacKenzie, "A family empire," ''BBC History Magazine'' (Jan 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1840s and 1850s, primary-, middle-, and high-schools were opened in many districts of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]], with most high schools offering English language instruction in some subjects.  In 1857, just before the end of Company rule, universities modelled on the [[University of London]] and using English as the medium of instruction were established in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and [[Chennai|Madras]]. During subsequent [[The Crown|Crown Rule]] in India, or the [[British Raj]], lasting from 1858 to 1947, English language penetration increased throughout India.  This was driven in part by the gradually increasing hiring of Indians in the [[civil services]].  At the time of India's independence in 1947, English was the only functional [[lingua franca]] in the country.

After [[Partition of India|Indian Independence]] in 1947, [[Hindi]] was declared the first official language, and attempts were made to declare Hindi the sole national language of India. Due to [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|protests from Tamil Nadu]] and other non-Hindi-speaking states, it was decided to temporarily retain English for official purposes until at least 1965.  By the end of this period, however, opposition from non-Hindi states was still too strong to have Hindi declared the sole language.  With this in mind, the English Language Amendment Bill declared English to be an associate language "until such time as all non-Hindi States had agreed to its being dropped."  This has not yet occurred, and it is still widely used. For instance, it is the only reliable means of day-to-day communication between the central government and the non-Hindi states.

The view of the [[English language]] among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Annamalai |first=E. |title=India: Language Situation |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of language &amp; linguistics |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=Keith |date=2006 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-044299-0 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0080448542046113 |accessdate=6 February 2015 |doi=10.1016/B0-08-044854-2/04611-3 |pages=610–613 |laysummary=http://www.elsevier.com/books/encyclopedia-of-language-and-linguistics-14-volume-set/brown/978-0-08-044854-1 |laydate=6 February 2015 |ref=harv}}{{Subscription or libraries|sentence|via=[[ScienceDirect]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is an assumption that English is readily available in India, available studies show that its usage is actually restricted to the elite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/840341/the-rise-of-hinglish-how-the-media-created-a-new-lingua-franca-for-indias-elites|title=The rise of Hinglish: How the media created a new lingua franca for India's elites}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of inadequate education to large parts of the Indian population. The use of outdated teaching methods and the poor grasp of English exhibited by the authors of many guidebooks, disadvantage students who rely on these books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chelliah|first=Shobhana L.|date=July 2001|title=Constructs of Indian English in language 'guidebooks'|journal=World Englishes|volume=20|issue=2|pages=161–178|doi=10.1111/1467-971X.00207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinglish===
{{Main|Hinglish}}
The term, "Hinglish", is a portmanteau of the languages [[English language|English]] and [[Hindi]]. This typically refers to the [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] hybrid use of Hindi, or any South Asian language and English. It is often the growing preferred language of the urban and semi-urban educated Indian youth, as well as the Indian diaspora abroad.&lt;ref name="The Times of India"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hinglish-gets-the-most-laughs-say-mumbais-standup-comics/articleshow/58555949.cms|title=Hinglish gets the most laughs, say Mumbai's standup comics - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindi film industry, more popularly known as Bollywood, incorporates considerable amounts of Hinglish as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/decoding-the-bollywood-poster/|title=Decoding the Bollywood poster - National Science and Media Museum blog|website=blog.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many internet platforms and voice commands on Google also recognize Hinglish.&lt;ref name="The Times of India"/&gt;

==Phonology==
Most Indians speak with a native tinted accent for their English speech, whereas the modern generation tends to speak with an accent similar to the [[Received Pronunciation]].

Indian English phonology is ultimately based on Received Pronunciation.

===Vowels===
In general, Indian English has fewer peculiarities in its vowel sounds than the consonants, especially as spoken by native speakers of languages like Hindi, the vowel phoneme system having some similarities with that of English. Among the distinctive features of the vowel-sounds employed by some Indian English speakers:

* Modern Indians, especially a minority of English students and teachers along with some people in various professions like telephone customer service agents, often speak with a [[non-rhotic]] accent. Examples of this include ''flower'' pronounced as {{IPA|/flaʊ.ə/}}, ''never'' as {{IPA|/nevə/}}, ''water'' as {{IPA|/wɔːtə/}}, etc.
* Many North Indians have a sing-song quality as they speak English, which perhaps, results from a similar tone used while speaking Hindi.
* Indian English speakers and thus do not make a clear distinction between {{IPAslink|ɒ}} and {{IPAslink|ɔː}} unlike RP i.e. have the [[cot-caught merger]]
* Diphthong {{IPA|/eɪ/}} is pronounced as {{IPAslink|eː}}
* Diphthong {{IPA|/əʊ/}} is pronounced as {{IPAslink|oː}}
* {{IPAslink|ɑː}} may be more front {{IPAslink|a}}
* Most Indians have the [[trap–bath split]] of [[Received Pronunciation]], affecting words such as ''class'', ''staff'' and ''last'' ({{IPA|/klɑːs/}}, {{IPA|/stɑːf/}} and {{IPA|/lɑːst/}} respectively). Though the trap-bath split is prevalent in Indian English, it varies greatly. Many younger Indians who read and listen to American English do not have this split. The distribution is somewhat similar to [[Australian English]] in [[Regional Indian English]] varieties, but it has a complete split in [[Cultivated Indian English]] and [[Standard Indian English]] varieties.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* Most Indians have a hoarse-horse split.
The following are the variations in Indian English resulting from inability to articulate few vowels
* Pronunciation of {{IPAslink|ɔ}} as {{IPAslink|o}}
* Pronunciation of {{IPAslink|æ}} and {{IPAslink|ɛ}} as {{IPAslink|e}}
* Pronunciation of {{IPAslink|ɔ}} and {{IPAslink|ɒ}} as {{IPAslink|a}}

===Consonants===
The following are the characteristics of dialect of Indian English most similar to RP:

* It is [[wikt:non-rhotic|non-rhotic]].
* The voiceless [[Stop consonant|plosives]] {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/}} are always unaspirated in Indian English,  (aspirated in cultivated form) whereas in RP, General American and most other English accents they are aspirated in word-initial or stressed syllables. Thus "pin" is pronounced {{IPA|[pɪn]}} in Indian English but {{IPA|[pʰɪn]}} in most other dialects. In native Indian languages (except in [[Dravidian languages]] such as [[Tamil language|Tamil]]), the distinction between aspirated and unaspirated plosives is phonemic, and the English stops are equated with the unaspirated rather than the aspirated phonemes of the local languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, pp. 627–628&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true of the voiceless postalveolar afficate {{IPA|/tʃ/}}.
* The [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]] stops English {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} are often [[retroflex]] {{IPA|[ɖ]}}, {{IPA|[ʈ]}}, especially in the South of India.&lt;ref name="wells_628" /&gt; In Indian languages there are two entirely distinct sets of coronal plosives: one [[dental consonant|dental]] and the other retroflex. Native speakers of Indian languages prefer to pronounce the English alveolar plosives sound as more retroflex than dental,{{Sfn|Ball|Muller|2014|ps=: The comments on retroflex consonants also apply to southern Indian languages such as Tamil, [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam]]. and [[Kannada]]. Speakers of these languages tend to use their own retroflex consonants in place of English alveolar It, d, n/. Although these languages do have nonretroflex stops, these are dental, and it seems that English alveolar stops are perceived as closer to the retroflex stops than to the dental ones.}} and the use of retroflex consonants is a common feature of Indian English.{{Sfn|Ball|Muller|2014|p=289b|ps=: This use of retroflex consonants is very characteristic of Indian English, and the retroflex resonance is very pervasive ...}}{{Sfn|Sailaja|2007|p=252|ps=: 1.4 ''Indian (Telugu) English'': All the adults who participated in this study spoke a Telugu variety of Indian English. Telugu pronunciation of English is heavily influenced by the spelling. Two identical letters in a word are articulated as geminates. The articulation is also mostly rhotic ... In place of the alveolar stops, retroflex sounds are used. Some speakers would also use a retroflex nasal in place of the alveolar nasal, and a retroflex lateral in place of the alveolar lateral.}} In the [[Devanagari]] script of Hindi, all alveolar plosives of English are transcribed as their retroflex counterparts. One good reason for this is that unlike most other native Indian languages, Hindi does not have ''true'' retroflex plosives (Tiwari, [1955] 2001). The so-called retroflexes in Hindi are actually articulated as apical [[Postalveolar consonant|post-alveolar]] plosives, sometimes even with a tendency to come down to the alveolar region. So a Hindi speaker normally cannot distinguish the difference between their own apical post-alveolar plosives and English's alveolar plosives. Languages such as Tamil have ''true'' retroflex plosives, however, wherein the articulation is done with the tongue curved upwards and backwards at the [[Palate|roof of the mouth]]. This also causes (in parts of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]]) the {{IPA|/s/}} preceding alveolar {{IPA|/t/}} to allophonically change to {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (&lt;stop&gt; {{IPA|/stɒp/}} → {{IPA|/ʃʈap/}}). Mostly in south India, some speakers allophonically further change the voiced retroflex plosives to voiced [[retroflex flap]], and the nasal {{IPA|/n/}} to a nasalised retroflex flap.
* All major native languages of India (except Bengali) lack the dental fricatives ({{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}}; spelled with ''th''). Usually, the [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] [[voiceless dental plosive]] {{IPA|[t̪ʰ]}} is substituted for {{IPA|/θ/}} in the north (it would be unaspirated in the south) and the unaspirated [[voiced dental plosive]] {{IPA|[d̪]}}, or possibly the aspirated version {{IPA|[d̪ʱ]}}, is substituted for {{IPA|/ð/}}.&lt;ref name="wells_629" /&gt; For example, "thin" would be realised as {{IPA|[t̪ʰɪn]}} instead of {{IPA|/θɪn/}} for North Indian speakers, whereas it would be pronounced unaspirated in the south.
The following are the variations in Indian English
* Pronunciations vary between rhotic and non-rhotic; with pronunciations leaning towards native phonology being generally rhotic, and others being non-rhotic.
* Most Indian languages (except [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]), including Standard Hindi, do not differentiate between {{IPA|/v/}} ([[voiced labiodental fricative]]) and {{IPA|/w/}} ([[voiced labiovelar approximant]]). Instead, many Indians use a frictionless [[labiodental approximant]] {{IPA|[ʋ]}} for words with either sound, possibly in free variation with {{IPA|[v]}} and/or {{IPA|[w]}} depending upon region. Thus, ''wet'' and ''vet'' are often homophones.&lt;ref name="wells_627"&gt;Wells, p. 627&lt;/ref&gt;
* Related to the previous characteristic, many Indians prefer to pronounce words such as &lt;flower&gt; as [flaː(r)], as opposed to [flaʊə(r)], and &lt;our&gt; as [aː(r)] as opposed to [aʊə(r)].
* South Indians tend to curl the tongue (retroflex accentuation) more for {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
* Sometimes, Indian speakers interchange {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, especially when plurals are being formed, unlike speakers of other varieties of English, who use [s] for the pluralisation of words ending in a voiceless consonant, [z] for words ending in a voiced consonant or vowel, and [ɨz] for words ending in a sibilant.
* In case of the postalveolar affricates {{IPA|/tʃ/}} {{IPA|/dʒ/}}, native languages like Hindi have corresponding affricates articulated from the palatal region, rather than postalveolar, and they have more of a stop component than fricative; this is reflected in their English.
* Whilst retaining {{IPA|/ŋ/}} in the final position, many Indian speakers add the {{IPA|[ɡ]}} sound after it when it occurs in the middle of a word. Hence {{IPA|/ˈriŋiŋ/}} → {{IPA|/ˈriŋɡiŋ/}} (''ringing'').{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
* [[Syllabic consonant|Syllabic]] {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} are usually replaced by the VC clusters {{IPA|[əl]}}, {{IPA|[əm]}} and {{IPA|[ən]}} (as in ''button'' {{IPA|/ˈbuʈʈən/}}), or if a [[Close vowel|high vowel]] precedes, by {{IPA|[il]}} (as in ''little'' {{IPA|/ˈliʈʈil/}}). Syllable nuclei in words with the spelling ''er''/''re'' (a [[schwa]] in RP and an r-coloured schwa in [[General American|GA]]) are also replaced VC clusters. e.g., ''metre'', {{IPA|/ˈmiːtər/}} → {{IPA|/ˈmiːʈər/}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
* Indian English uses clear [l] in all instances like [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]] whereas other varieties use clear [l] in syllable-initial positions and dark [l] (velarised-L) in coda and syllabic positions.
The following are the variations in Indian English that are often discouraged
* Most Indian languages (except [[Urdu]] varieties and [[Assamese language|Assamese]]) lack the [[voiced alveolar fricative]] /z/. A significant portion of Indians thus, even though their native languages do have its nearest equivalent: the unvoiced /s/, often use the voiced palatal affricate (or postalveolar) /dʒ/, just as with a [[Korean language|Korean]] accent. This makes words such as &lt;zero&gt; and &lt;rosy&gt; sound as [ˈdʒiːro] and [ˈroːdʒiː] (the latter, especially in the North). This replacement is equally true for Persian and [[Arabic]] loanwords into Hindi. The probable reason is the confusion created by the use of the Devanagari grapheme &lt; ज &gt; (for /dʒ/) with a dot beneath it to represent the loaned /z/ (as &lt; ज़ &gt;). This is common among people without formal English education.
* In [[Assamese language|Assamese]], {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} is pronounced as {{IPA|/s/}}; and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} and {{IPA|/ʒ/}} is pronounced as {{IPA|/z/}}. Retroflex and dental consonants are not present and only alveolar consonants are used unlike other Indian languages. Similar to [[Bengali language|Bengali]], {{IPA|/v/}} is pronounced as {{IPA|/bʱ/}} and {{IPA|/β/}} in Assamese. For example; change is pronounced as {{IPA|[sɛɪnz]}}, vote is pronounced as {{IPA|[bʱʊt]}} and English is pronounced as {{IPA|[iŋlis]}}.
* Again, in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and dialects like [[Bhojpuri]], all instances of {{IPA|/ʃ/}} are spoken like {{IPA|[s]}}, a phenomenon that is also apparent in their English. Exactly the opposite is seen for many [[Bengali people|Bengalis]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
* Inability to pronounce certain (especially word-initial) [[consonant cluster]]s by people of rural backgrounds, as with some Spanish-speakers. This is usually dealt with by [[epenthesis]]. e.g., ''school'' {{IPA|/isˈkuːl/}}.
* Many Indians with lower exposure to English also may pronounce /f/ as aspirated [[voiceless bilabial plosive]] [pʰ]. Again note that in Hindi (Devanagari) the loaned /f/ from Persian and Arabic is written by putting a dot beneath the grapheme for native [pʰ] &lt; फ &gt;: &lt; फ़ &gt;. This substitution is rarer than that for [z], and in fact in many Hindi /f/ is used by native speakers instead of /pʰ/, or the two are used interchangeably.
* Many speakers of Indian English do not use the [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] ({{IPA|/ʒ/}}). Some Indians use {{IPA|/z/}} or {{IPA|/dʒ/}} instead, e.g. ''treasure'' {{IPA|/ˈtrɛzəːr/}},&lt;ref name="wells_628" /&gt; and in the south Indian variants, with {{IPA|/ʃ/}} as in &lt;"sh'"ore&gt;, e.g. ''treasure'' {{IPA|/ˈtrɛʃər/}}.

===Spelling pronunciation===
A number of distinctive features of Indian English are due to "[[English orthography|the vagaries of English spelling]]".&lt;ref name="wells_629"/&gt; Most Indian languages, unlike English, have a nearly phonetic spelling, so the spelling of a word is a highly reliable guide to its modern pronunciation. Indians' tendency to pronounce English phonetically as well can cause divergence from Western English.
* In words where the digraph &lt;gh&gt; represents a [[voiced velar plosive]] ({{IPA|/ɡ/}}) in other accents, some Indian English speakers supply a murmured version {{IPA|[ɡʱ]}}, for example &lt;ghost&gt; {{IPA|[ɡʱoːst]}}. No other accent of English admits this voiced aspiration.&lt;ref name="wells_628"/&gt;
* Similarly, the digraph &lt;wh&gt; may be aspirated as {{IPA|[ʋʱ]}} or {{IPA|[wʱ]}}, resulting in realisations such as &lt;which&gt; {{IPA|[ʋʱɪtʃ]}}, found in no other English accent.&lt;ref name="wells_630"&gt;Wells, p. 630&lt;/ref&gt; This is somewhat similar to the traditional distinction between ''wh'' and ''w'' present in English, however, wherein the former is /ʍ/, whilst the latter is /w/.
* In unstressed syllables, which speakers of American English would realise as a [[schwa]], speakers of Indian English would use the spelling vowel, making &lt;sanity&gt; sound as [ˈsæniti] instead of [ˈsænəti]. This trait is also present in other South Asian dialects (i.e. [[Pakistani English|Pakistani]] and [[Sri Lankan English]]), and in [[Received Pronunciation|RP]], etc.
* The word "of" is usually pronounced with a {{IPA|/f/}} instead of a {{IPA|/v/}} as in most other accents.&lt;ref name="wells_629"&gt;Wells, p. 629&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of {{IPA|[d]}} instead of {{IPA|[t]}} for the "-ed" ending of the past tense after voiceless consonants, for example "developed" may be {{IPA|[ˈdɛʋləpd]}} instead of RP {{IPA|/dɪˈvɛləpt/}}.&lt;ref name="wells_628"&gt;Wells, p. 628&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of {{IPA|[s]}} instead of {{IPA|[z]}} for the "-s" ending of the plural after voiced consonants, for example &lt;dogs&gt; may be {{IPA|[daɡs]}} instead of {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}}.&lt;ref name="wells_629"/&gt;
* Pronunciation of &lt;house&gt; as [hauz] in both the noun and the verb, instead of [haus] as noun and [hauz] as verb.
* In RP, {{IPA|/r/}} occurs only before a vowel. But some speakers of Indian English, primarily in [[South India|the South]], use {{IPA|/r/}} in almost all positions in words using the letter 'r',&lt;ref name="wells_629"/&gt; similar to most [[American English|American]] and some Irish dialects. The [[allophony|allophone]] used is a mild trill or a tap. Indian speakers do not typically use the [[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|/ɻ/}} for &lt;r&gt;, which is common for American English speakers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}
* In certain words, especially Latinate words ending in ''ile'', is pronounced [ɪ] in America and [aɪ] in Britain. Indian English, like most other [[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth dialects]], will invariably use the British pronunciation. Thus, &lt;tensile&gt; would be pronounced as [ˈtɛnsaɪl] like the British, rather than [ˈtɛnsɪl] like the American; &lt;anti&gt;, on the other hand, use {{IPA|i}}, as [ˈænti] like in Britain, rather than [ˈæntaɪ] like in America. Similar effects of British colonisation are 're', 'ise', and 'our' spellings in words like 'metre', 'realise', and 'endeavour', respectively, which Americans would spell as 'meter', 'realize' and 'endeavor'.
* Deletion is not commonly used. For example, "salmon" is usually pronounced with a distinct "l".

===Supra-segmental features===
English is a [[stress-timed language]], and both syllable stress and [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]], where only certain words in a sentence or phrase are stressed, are important features of received pronunciation. Indian native languages are actually [[syllable-timed language]]s, like French. Indian-English speakers usually speak with a syllabic rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language (Cambridge University Press, 1995), page 360&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in some Indian languages, stress is associated with a low pitch,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguistics.uiuc.edu/sala25/verma.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901152555/http://www.linguistics.uiuc.edu/sala25/verma.htm|date=1 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in most English dialects, stressed syllables are generally pronounced with a higher pitch. Thus, when some Indian speakers speak, they appear to put the stress accents at the wrong syllables, or accentuate all the syllables of a long English word. Certain Indian accents are of a "sing-song" nature, a feature seen in a few English dialects in Britain, such as [[Scouse]] and [[Welsh English]].&lt;ref&gt;Varshney, R.L., "An Introductory Textbook of Linguistics and Phonetics", 15th Ed. (2005), Student Store, Bareilly.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbering system==
The [[Indian numbering system]] is preferred for digit grouping. When written in words, or when spoken,
numbers less than 100,000/100 000 are expressed just as they are in Standard English.  Numbers including and beyond 100,000 /
100 000 are expressed in a subset of the Indian numbering system. Thus, the following scale is used:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! In digits (International system) !! In digits (Indian system) !! In words ([[long and short scales]]) !! In words (Indian system)
|-
| colspan="2" | 10 || colspan="3" | ten
|-
| colspan="2" | 100 || colspan="3" | 
|-
| colspan="2" | 1,000 || colspan="3" | one thousand
|-
| colspan="2" | 10,000 || colspan="3" | ten thousand
|-
| 100,000 || 1,00,000 || one hundred thousand || one [[lakh]] (from lākh लाख)
|-
| 1,000,000 || 10,00,000 || one million || ten [[lakh]] (from lākh लाख)
|-
| 10,000,000 || 1,00,00,000 || ten million || one [[crore]] (from karoṛ करोड़)
|}

Larger numbers are generally expressed as multiples of the above (for example, one lakh crores for one [[trillion (short scale)|trillion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bsl.co.in/india/news/investors-lose-rs-44-lakh-crore-in-four-days/416306/ |title=Investors lose Rs 4.4 lakh crore in four days &amp;#124; Business Standard |publisher=Bsl.co.in |date=2010-11-27 |accessdate=2013-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316003619/http://bsl.co.in/india/news/investors-lose-rs-44-lakh-crore-in-four-days/416306/ |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartinvestor.in/market/story-31563-storydet-Corporate_chiefs_getting_crores_in_salaries_100_and_counting.htm |title=Corporate chiefs getting crores in salaries: 100 and counting! – The Smart Investor |publisher=Smartinvestor.in |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
Indian English has political, sociological, and administrative terms of modern India: [[dharna]], [[hartal]], [[eve-teasing]], [[vote bank]], [[swaraj]], [[swadeshi]], [[scheduled caste]], [[scheduled tribe]], [[non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRI]]; it has words of Anglo-India such as [[tiffin]], [[hill station]], [[gymkhana]]; and it has slang.

{{linguistics}}

'''Intercomprehension''' is when people try to communicate with each other using their own different languages. Intercomprehension can be explained as a dialogue between people from two different languages. Each one expresses in their own language, making efforts to understand each other.

Here we find some European methods to learn Intercomprehension. These four methods were the pioneer in this branch of [[linguistics]] and started around 2000 in different universities: Galatea,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://galatea.u-grenoble3.fr Galatea]&lt;/ref&gt; EuRom4,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.up.univ-mrs.fr/delic/Eurom4/ Eurom4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930005402/http://www.up.univ-mrs.fr/delic/Eurom4/ |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.eurom5.com/ EuRom5]&lt;/ref&gt; EuroComRom (Les sept tamis),&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.hgklein.de/sieben/BIN/start.htm Les Sept Tamis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080812/http://www.hgklein.de/sieben/BIN/start.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; et ''Understanding romance languages''.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=jw2anTPAnWQC&amp;pg=PA12 ''Understanding romance languages'']&lt;/ref&gt; All these methods focused in reading skills learning simultaneously in different Latin languages as these languages are so close in [[semantics]], [[phonetics]], [[etymology]] etc.

** Kachari is a tonal language, consisting of 4 tones high, mid, low and neutral (1, 2, 3, 0)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Grammar==

=== ''Syntax'' ===

==== The word order of Kachari is [[Subject–object–verb|Subject-Object-Verb]] (SOV).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=I6YTAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PR28|title=Outline Grammar of the Kachari (Bara) Language as Spoken in District Darrang, Assam: With Illustrative Sentences, Notes, Reading Lessons, and a Short Vocabulary|last=Endle|first=Sidney|date=1884-01-01|publisher=Assam Secretariat Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
* Kachari uses many instances of "compound words" to denote meaning. For example, the word for "boy", is really the combination of the Kachari words for "male" and "child". This also correlates with Kachari verbs, which can be [[Agglutination|agglutinated]] to form "compound verbs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.b4216782|title=A collection of Kachári folk-tales and rhymes,|last=Anderson|first=J. D.|date=1895-01-01|publisher=Shillong,}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Kachari is not polysynthetic, its verbs act as a stem for descriptive adjective, adverbs or affixes to change its meaning. For example, the "conjugation of the regular verb active, 'nu-nǔ.' to see" results in the following:

|}

=== ''Tense'' ===

==== Future Tense ====
As can be seen from the chart above, the future tense is indicated with -gan, while -si- indicates that the future event will occur soon or in the near future. One example is "Bí faigan", he will come, as opposed to "Bí faisigan", he will come (almost at once) or he is about to come.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Present Tense'''

Present tense is shown through three affixes, "ǔ", "dong" and "gô". The first two forms represent indefinite and definite forms and are far more common that "gô", which is frequently only used to answer questions in the affirmative.

=== Adjectives ===
Most [[adjective]]s can be added both before or after the noun it is describing, though it gains the case ending if it follows the noun, rather than precedes it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This follows the identification of as a strongly suffixing language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_kac|title=Language Kachari|last=|first=|date=|website=wals.info|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this classification goes against Konwar's description of Kachari and a related language, [[Karbi language|Karbi]], as primarily prefixing to create adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konwar|first=Aparna|date=2002|title=Some Aspects of the Boro and the Karbi morphology|url=|journal=Indian Linguistics|volume=63|pages=39–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerical adjectives are always inserted after the noun it is describing. For example, "ten goats" is "Burmá má-zǔ" with "Burmá" meaning goat, "má" being the [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] for "animal" and the number ten being "zǔ".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== ''Morphology'' ===
'''Gender'''  - Common nouns such as father, mother, brother or sister have distinct masculine and feminine words while other nouns including animals, will typically have the words for male and female, -jelá and -jeu respectively, added on as a suffix to denote gender. Other common masculine and feminine suffix forms that may be used include -zǎlá/-zǔ, -bundā/-bundi, -bóndá/-bóndi, -phántá/-phánti and -pherá/-pheri.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Number System ===
Kachari has a decimal system and counts to 10 with unique words, after which the number words combine to add to the larger number as shown in the chart below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mpi-lingweb.shh.mpg.de/numeral/Bodo.htm|title=Sino-Tibetan Languages: Bodo|last=Brahma|first=Aleendra|date=2009|website=Numeral Systems of the World's Languages|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''listening station''' is a facility established to monitor radio and [[microwave]] signals and analyse their content to secure information and intelligence for use by the security and diplomatic community and others or to make local transmissions more widely available, thus the London pirate listening station streams London FM pirate transmissions via the internet to the global community.

[[Y-stations]] were British Signals Intelligence collection sites initially established during [[World War I]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiqueradios.com/chrs/journal/intelligence.html Y-stations in World War I]&lt;/ref&gt;  and later used during [[World War II]].

Examples are [[BBC Monitoring]] at [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]], [[RAF Menwith Hill]], [[Harrogate]] and [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), [[Cheltenham]]; London Listening Station.

A '''maternal insult''' (also referred to as a '''"yo mama" joke''') is a reference to a person's [[mother]] through the use of phrases such as "your mother"&lt;!-- please do not include a list here, add them to the lower section --&gt; or other regional variants, frequently used to [[insult]] the target by way of their mother.&lt;ref name="mal11"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.juggling.org/~conway/juggler/MAL.TXT |volume=11 |journal=[[Maledicta]] |author=Andrew Conway |year=1994 |title=You're ugly, your dick is small and everybody's afraid to fuck your mother: The Stand Up Comedian's Response to the Heckler |accessdate=2007-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used as an insult, "your mother ..." preys on widespread sentiments of [[filial piety]], making the insult particularly and globally offensive. "Your mother" can be combined with most types of insults, although suggestions of [[promiscuity]] are particularly common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Millicent R. Ayoub and Sephen A.

Insults involving "your mother" are commonly used when playing [[the Dozens]].

Although the phrase has a long history of including a description portion, such as the old "your mother wears combat boots", the phrase "yo mama" by itself, without any qualifiers, has become commonly used as an all-purpose insult&lt;ref name="mal11" /&gt; or an expression of defiance.

==Historic examples==
In the [[Bible]], King [[Jehoram Of Israel|Joram]] is greeted by the rebel [[Jehu]] with a hostile expression concerning Joram's mother:

{{blockquote|
When Joram saw Jehu, he said, "Is it peace, Jehu?"&lt;br /&gt;
And he answered, "What peace, so long as the harlotries of your mother [[Jezebel]] and her witchcrafts are so many?"&lt;ref&gt;http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-22.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[William Shakespeare]] used such a device in Act I Scene 1 of ''[[Timon of Athens]]'', implying that a character's mother is a "[[wikt:bitch|bitch]]":
{{blockquote|
''Painter'': "Y'are a dog."&lt;br /&gt;
''Apemantus'': "Thy mother's of my generation. What's she, if I be a dog?"
}}

Also in Act IV, Scene II of ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', Aaron taunts his lover's sons:
{{blockquote|
''Demetrius'': "Villain, what hast thou done?"&lt;br /&gt;
''Aaron'': "That which thou canst not undo."&lt;br /&gt;
''Chiron'': "Thou hast undone our mother."&lt;br /&gt;
''Aaron'': "Villain, I have done thy mother."
}}

'''Medium theory''' is the name assigned to a variety of approaches used to examine how the means of expression of human communication impact the meaning(s) of human communication(s).

[[Joshua Meyrowitz]] originated the term in his 1985 book, ''No Sense of Place''.  Other scholars with work relevant to medium theory include [[Marshall McLuhan]] (1963, 1966, 1988) and [[Neil Postman]] (1985). Currently, medium theory occupies a marginal position within U.S. communication and media studies (Croteau &amp; Hoynes, 2003:305). The majority of U.S. communication and media studies place their emphasis on the content of communication (e.g., sex and violence) not the medium of communications. In Canada and elsewhere, the theory continues to inform studies that assess large-scale social changes that follow the adoption of a new medium. German [[media theory]] operates along similar lines and is influenced by McLuhan, though it occupies a more central location in German academia.

Joshua Meyrowitz (1985) uses the term 'medium theory' to refer to the body of literature that focuses on the technological aspects of media beyond their content. It aims to look beyond the content to the medium which reveals the key to its social impact (Croteau &amp; Hoynes, 2003:305).

==McLuhan's message==
[[Marshall McLuhan]] is best known for his phrase "the medium is the message". McLuhan believed that we should observe not only the media itself but 'the ways in which each new medium disrupts tradition and reshapes social life' (Croteau &amp; Hoynes 2003,307). He believed that the social impact of the media was that they became 'an extension of our senses, and alter our social world' (Croteau &amp; Hoynes, 2003:307). In his book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' (1962) McLuhan argued that when new media technologies were introduced into society, the balance of our senses were reworked, highlighting some at the expense of others. For example, print intensified the visual and separated it from our other senses; in particular sound. "McLuhan even argued that print media helped create a sensory environment that produced Western capitalist societies - an environment that was bureaucratic and organized around mass production, an ideology of individualism, and a commitment to the nation-state as the fundamental social unit."

==Technological determinism== 
Medium theory has always been criticized by its [[technological determinism]]. [[Raymond Williams]] is one of the most ardent critics of this concept. He believed that technological determinism 'emerges' from Technical study and experiments and then changes the sector or society in which it emerged from. Which means that we adapt towards the new technologies that arise because it is the new modern way of doing it.
The deterministic approach says that technology in itself has the power to change societies and the power to condition humans even though humans are the ones that's using said technology. Although [[McLuhan]] strongly believes that the introduction to any new media will change the way we live, Williams argue that the new technology in itself has no real significance to social value unless it has been adapted to existing social and economic conditions.

National Captioning Institute also has an office in [[Santa Clarita, California]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncicap.org/contact/ Contact]". ''National Captioning Institute''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[National Association of Broadcasters]] formed a task force in 1972 to create the technology to provide captions of television broadcasts without an unreasonably large financial burden on television networks or local television stations.&lt;ref name = decoding&gt;Brennan, Patricia (September 29, 1985). "National Captioning Institute: CC: Decoding Television for the Hearing Impaired". ''The Washington Post''. p. TV8.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal funding paid for the technology. Viewers would buy an adapter for their televisions that would decode and display the text while watching closed-captioned television programs.&lt;ref name = decoding/&gt; Up to that point, captioning of television shows was rare, with [[Boston]] television station [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] being one of the few with open captioning of news and public affairs shows since the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, Robert A. (October 15, 1980). "Closed-caption is Catching On". ''Boston Globe''. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLean, Robert A. (November 13, 1980). "The Latest in Captions". ''Boston Globe''. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

National Captioning Institute was incorporated on January 30, 1979, with millions of dollars of start-up funding from the federal government.&lt;ref name= corp&gt;"[https://corponline.dcra.dc.gov/BizEntity.aspx/ViewEntityData?entityId=2759265 National Captioning Institute, Inc.]" ''District of Columbia Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs''. [[Government of the District of Columbia]]. Retrieved September 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= gives&gt;Stevens, Mary (May 5, 1989). "Captioning gives deaf whole story". ''Chicago Tribune''. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rattner, Steven (April 16, 1979). "Washington Watch: Legislative Veto Faces Test Studying the Energy Department Broadcasters Help the Deaf Briefcases". ''The New York Times''. p. D2.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23, 1979, [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] announced plans for closed-captioning of twenty hours per week of television shows.&lt;ref name= plans&gt;"Plans for Prime-Time TV Captions". ''The Washington Post''. March 24, 1979. p. B4.&lt;/ref&gt; National Captioning Institute established its original headquarters in [[Bailey's Crossroads, Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;"Real Estate Notes".

''Associated Press''. Boston Globe. January 7, 1980. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

National Captioning Institute's work first became publicly well known on March 16, 1980, when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[PBS]] collectively introduced closed-captioning of their television shows.&lt;ref name = decoding/&gt; At the time, [[CBS]] decided not the join the group at first because CBS preferred a different captioning system that was being used in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Les (February 5, 1980). "New Device Calls Up Printed Matter on TV: How the Systems Vary Regarded as Superior Way The First Programs". ''The New York Times''. p. C24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmody, John (January 29, 1980). "The TV Column". ''The Washington Post''. p. B10.&lt;/ref&gt; John E.D. Ball was the founding president of the National Captioning Institute.&lt;ref name= ball&gt;"John E.D. Ball" (obituary). ''The Washington Post''. April 13, 2010. p.

"How I Got Here: Helping the Hearing Impaired And Voicing the Klingons". ''Wall Street Journal''. p. D4.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, employees of National Captioning Institute used [[court reporter|court-reporter]] [[stenotype|steno machine]]s to caption shows.&lt;ref name= nishi/&gt;

[[Rosalynn Carter]] hosted a reception at the [[White House]] honoring the work of National Captioning Institute on March 19, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Carmody, John (March 12, 1980). "The TV Column". ''The Washington Post''. p. D14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Hollywood Radio and Television Society gave an award to the National Captioning Institute for developing the closed captioning system for television shows.&lt;ref&gt;"A Lego Toys commerical &lt;!--sic?--&gt; filmed in England". ''UPI NewsTrack''. March 4, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[RCA]]/[[Columbia Pictures|Columbia Pictures Home Video]] became the first video company to release movies on [[videotape]] that had closed captions.&lt;ref name= nishi/&gt;

In 1993, a federal law went into effect that required built-in capacity to display captions on all televisions 13 inches or larger, which would make purchasing separate decoders no longer necessary.&lt;ref name= ball/&gt;&lt;ref name= regular&gt;Yant, Monica (June 29, 1993). "Captioning Gets a Regular Role on TV Television: Federal law takes effect Thursday requiring sets 13 inches or larger to have built-in subtitle capability". ''Los Angeles Times''. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all television shows were being broadcast with closed-captions at that point.&lt;ref name= regular/&gt;

On September 11, 2001, Holli Miller provided live captioning about the [[September 11 attacks]] on New York City station [[WNYW]].&lt;ref name= iowan&gt;Probasco-Sowers, Juli (December 8, 2001). "Iowan's fingers fly to create TV captions". ''Des Moines Register'' (Des Moines, Iowa). p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's shift had been scheduled to end around the time of the attacks, but Miller decided she needed to continue working in order to inform people of the critical information.&lt;ref name= iowan/&gt; Miller's hands shook as she typed while the television station showed the [[United Airlines Flight 175|second airplane]] crash into the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].&lt;ref name= iowan/&gt; Miller worked six hours more than her usual two and a half hour shift, taking only one two-minute break all that time, despite usually taking breaks when commercials are ordinarily broadcast.&lt;ref name= iowan/&gt;

In 2006, National Captioning Institute terminated the employment of 14 employees who had joined the National Association of Employees and Transmission Technicians in an effort to have reasonable workloads, receive annual cost-of-living raises, and prevent cuts in employee benefit plans.&lt;ref&gt;Macías, Jorge Luis (April 1, 2006). "Protestan ex empleados de NCI" (Spanish). ''La Opinión'' (Los Angeles, California). p. 3A.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{linguistics}}
'''Phonology''' is a branch of [[linguistics]] concerned with the systematic organization of [[sound]]s in languages. It has traditionally focused largely on the study of the [[system]]s of [[phoneme]]s in particular [[language]]s (and therefore used to be also called ''phonemics'', or ''phonematics''), but it may also cover any [[linguistic analysis]] either at a level beneath the word (including [[syllable]], onset and [[syllable rime|rime]], [[articulatory gestures]], articulatory features, [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]], etc.) or at all levels of language where [[sound]] is considered to be structured for conveying [[linguistic meaning]]. 

[[Sign language|Sign languages]] have a phonological system equivalent to the system of sounds in spoken languages. The building blocks of signs are specifications for movement, location and handshape.&lt;ref&gt;[[William C. Stokoe|Stokoe, William C.]] (1960, 1978). ''Sign language structure: An outline of the visual communication systems of the American deaf''. Studies in linguistics, Occasional papers, No. 8, Dept. of Anthropology and Linguistics, University at Buffalo. 2d ed., Silver Spring: Md: Linstok Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The word 'phonology' (as in ''[[English phonology|the phonology of English]]'') can also refer to the phonological system (sound system) of a given language. This is one of the fundamental systems which a language is considered to comprise, like its [[syntax]] and its [[vocabulary]].

Phonology is often distinguished from ''[[phonetics]]''. While phonetics concerns the physical production, acoustic transmission and [[perception]] of the sounds of speech,&lt;ref name=Lass1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carr2003/&gt; phonology describes the way sounds function within a given language or across languages to encode meaning.  For many linguists, phonetics belongs to [[descriptive linguistics]], and phonology to [[theoretical linguistics]], although establishing the phonological system of a language is necessarily an application of theoretical principles to analysis of phonetic evidence. Note that this distinction was not always made, particularly before the development of the modern concept of the [[phoneme]] in the mid 20th century. Some subfields of modern phonology have a crossover with phonetics in descriptive disciplines such as [[psycholinguistics]] and [[speech perception]], resulting in specific areas like [[articulatory phonology]] or [[laboratory phonology]].

==Derivation and definitions==
The word ''phonology'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|φωνή}}, ''phōnḗ'', "voice, sound," and the suffix ''[[-logy]]'' (which is from Greek {{lang|grc|λόγος}}, ''lógos'', "word, speech, subject of discussion"). Definitions of the term vary. [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] in ''Grundzüge der Phonologie'' (1939) defines phonology as "the study of sound pertaining to the system of language," as opposed to phonetics, which is "the study of sound pertaining to the act of speech" (the distinction between ''language'' and ''speech'' being basically [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]'s distinction between [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']]).&lt;ref name="GdP"&gt;Trubetzkoy N., ''Grundzüge der Phonologie'' (published 1939), translated by C. Baltaxe as ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej6ENdUGS-UC&amp;dq=%22Grundz%C3%BCge+der+Phonologie%22&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Principles of Phonology]'', University of California Press, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Lass (1998) writes that phonology refers broadly to the subdiscipline of linguistics concerned with the sounds of language, while in more narrow terms, "phonology proper is concerned with the function, behavior and organization of sounds as linguistic items."&lt;ref name=Lass1998/&gt; According to Clark ''et al.'' (2007), it means the systematic use of [[sound]] to encode meaning in any spoken [[human language]], or the field of linguistics studying this use.&lt;ref name=ClarkEtal2007/&gt;

==History&lt;!--'History of phonology' redirects here--&gt;==
Early evidence for a systematic study of the sounds in a language appears in the 4th century BCE ''[[Ashtadhyayi]]'', a [[Sanskrit]] grammar composed by Pāṇini. In particular the ''[[Shiva Sutras]]'', an auxiliary text to the ''Ashtadhyayi'', introduces what may be considered a list of the phonemes of the Sanskrit language, with a notational system for them that is used throughout the main text, which deals with matters of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]] and [[semantics]].

The study of phonology as it exists today is defined by the formative studies of the 19th-century Polish scholar [[Jan Baudouin de Courtenay]], who (together with his students [[Mikołaj Kruszewski]] and [[Lev Shcherba]]) shaped the modern usage of the term ''[[phoneme]]'' in a series of lectures&lt;!--''A detailed programme of lectures for the academic year'', p. 115--&gt; in 1876-1877. The word ''phoneme'' had been coined a few years earlier in 1873 by the French linguist [[A. Dufriche-Desgenettes]]. In a paper read at the 24th of May meeting of the [[Société de Linguistique de Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;Anon (probably [[Louis Havet]]). (1873) "Sur la nature des consonnes nasales".

He also worked on the theory of phonetic alternations (what is now called [[allophony]] and [[morphophonology]]), and may have had an influence on the work of Saussure according to [[E. F. K. Koerner]].&lt;ref&gt;[[E. F. K. Koerner]], ''Ferdinand de Saussure: Origin and Development of His Linguistic Thought in Western Studies of Language.

[[File:Nikolai Trubetzkoy.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Nikolai Trubetzkoy, 1920s]]
An influential school of phonology in the interwar period was the [[Prague school]]. One of its leading members was Prince [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], whose ''Grundzüge der Phonologie'' (''Principles of Phonology''),&lt;ref name="GdP" /&gt; published posthumously in 1939, is among the most important works in the field from this period. Directly influenced by Baudouin de Courtenay, Trubetzkoy is considered the founder of [[morphophonology]], although this concept had also been recognized by de Courtenay. Trubetzkoy also developed the concept of the ''[[archiphoneme]]''. Another important figure in the Prague school was [[Roman Jakobson]], who was one of the most prominent linguists of the 20th century.

In 1968 [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Morris Halle]] published ''[[The Sound Pattern of English]]'' (SPE), the basis for [[generative phonology]]. In this view, phonological representations are sequences of [[segment (linguistics)|segments]] made up of [[distinctive feature]]s. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, [[Gunnar Fant]], and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: [[underlying representation]] and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how [[underlying representation]] is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded [[morphophonology]] into phonology, which both solved and created problems.

Natural phonology is a theory based on the publications of its proponent David Stampe in 1969 and (more explicitly) in 1979. In this view, phonology is based on a set of universal [[phonological process]]es that interact with one another; which ones are active and which are suppressed is language-specific. Rather than acting on segments, phonological processes act on [[distinctive feature]]s within [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] groups. Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance. Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously (though the output of one process may be the input to another). The second most prominent natural phonologist is [[Patricia Donegan]] (Stampe's wife); there are many natural phonologists in Europe, and a few in the U.S., such as Geoffrey Nathan. The principles of natural phonology were extended to [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] by [[Wolfgang U. Dressler]], who founded natural morphology.

In 1976, [[John Goldsmith (linguist)|John Goldsmith]] introduced [[autosegmental phonology]]. Phonological phenomena are no longer seen as operating on ''one'' linear sequence of segments, called phonemes or feature combinations, but rather as involving ''some parallel sequences'' of features which reside on multiple tiers. Autosegmental phonology later evolved into [[feature geometry]], which became the standard theory of representation for theories of the organization of phonology as different as lexical phonology and [[optimality theory]].

[[Government phonology]], which originated in the early 1980s as an attempt to unify theoretical notions of syntactic and phonological structures, is based on the notion that all languages necessarily follow a small set of [[principle]]s and vary according to their selection of certain binary [[parameter]]s.  That is, all languages' phonological structures are essentially the same, but there is restricted variation that accounts for differences in surface realizations. Principles are held to be inviolable, though parameters may sometimes come into conflict. Prominent figures in this field include [[Jonathan Kaye (linguist)|Jonathan Kaye]], Jean Lowenstamm, Jean-Roger Vergnaud, Monik Charette, and John Harris.

In a course at the LSA summer institute in 1991, [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] developed [[optimality theory]]—an overall architecture for phonology according to which languages choose a pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints ordered by importance; a lower-ranked constraint can be violated when the violation is necessary in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint. The approach was soon extended to morphology by [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John McCarthy]] and [[Alan Prince]], and has become a dominant trend in phonology. The appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements (e.g. features) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of 'substance-free phonology', especially by [[Mark Hale]] and [[Charles Reiss]].&lt;ref name=HaleReiss2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=HaleReiss2000/&gt;

An integrated approach to phonological theory that combines synchronic and diachronic accounts to sound patterns was initiated with [[Evolutionary Phonology]] in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Blevins, Juliette. 2004. ''Evolutionary phonology: The emergence of sound patterns''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of phonemes==
An important part of traditional, pre-generative schools of phonology is studying which sounds can be grouped into distinctive units within a language; these units are known as [[phoneme]]s. For example, in English, the "p" sound in ''pot'' is [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] (pronounced {{IPA|[pʰ]}}) while that in ''spot'' is not aspirated (pronounced {{IPA|[p]}}). However, English speakers intuitively treat both sounds as variations ([[allophone]]s) of the same phonological category, that is of the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}}. (Traditionally, it would be argued that if an aspirated {{IPA|[pʰ]}} were interchanged with the unaspirated {{IPA|[p]}} in ''spot'', native speakers of English would still hear the same words; that is, the two sounds are perceived as "the same" {{IPA|/p/}}.) In some other languages, however, these two sounds are perceived as different, and they are consequently assigned to different phonemes. For example, in [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Hindi]], and [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], there are [[minimal pair]]s of words for which aspiration is the only contrasting feature (two words can have different meanings but with the only difference in pronunciation being that one has an aspirated sound where the other has an unaspirated one).

[[File:Phonological Diagram of modern Arabic and Hebrew vowels.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The vowels of modern (Standard) [[Arabic]] and (Israeli) [[Hebrew]] from the phonemic point of view. Note the intersection of the two circles—the distinction between short ''a'', ''i'' and ''u'' is made by both speakers, but Arabic lacks the mid articulation of short vowels, while Hebrew lacks the distinction of vowel length.]]

[[File:Phonetic Diagram of modern Arabic and Hebrew vowels.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The vowels of modern (Standard) Arabic and (Israeli) Hebrew from the phonetic point of view. Note that the two circles are totally separate—none of the vowel-sounds made by speakers of one language is made by speakers of the other.]]

Part of the phonological study of a language therefore involves looking at data (phonetic [[transcription (linguistics)|transcriptions]] of the speech of [[native speaker]]s) and trying to deduce what the underlying [[phoneme]]s are and what the sound inventory of the language is. The presence or absence of minimal pairs, as mentioned above, is a frequently used criterion for deciding whether two sounds should be assigned to the same phoneme. However, other considerations often need to be taken into account as well.

The particular contrasts which are phonemic in a language can change over time. At one time, {{IPA|[f]}} and {{IPA|[v]}}, two sounds that have the same place and manner of articulation and differ in voicing only, were [[allophones]] of the same phoneme in English, but later came to belong to separate phonemes. This is one of the main factors of historical change of languages as described in [[historical linguistics]].

The findings and insights of speech perception and articulation research complicate the traditional and somewhat intuitive idea of interchangeable allophones being perceived as the same phoneme. First, interchanged allophones of the same phoneme can result in unrecognizable words. Second, actual speech, even at a word level, is highly co-articulated, so it is problematic to expect to be able to splice words into simple segments without affecting speech perception.

Different linguists therefore take different approaches to the problem of assigning sounds to phonemes. For example, they differ in the extent to which they require allophones to be phonetically similar. There are also differing ideas as to whether this grouping of sounds is purely a tool for linguistic analysis, or reflects an actual process in the way the human brain processes a language.

Since the early 1960s, theoretical linguists have moved away from the traditional concept of a phoneme, preferring to consider basic units at a more abstract level, as a component of [[morpheme]]s; these units can be called ''morphophonemes'', and analysis using this approach is called [[morphophonology]].&lt;!-- This is not correct, morphophonemes were present already in the Prague School and are by no means an invention of generative phonology. "Underlying segments" should be referred to instead. If the author does not chage it, I will edit it later. --&gt;

==Other topics in phonology==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Quebec French]] --&gt;
In addition to the minimal units that can serve the purpose of differentiating meaning (the [[phoneme]]s), phonology studies how sounds alternate, i.e. replace one another in different forms of the same morpheme ([[allomorph]]s), as well as, for example, [[syllable]] structure, [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[feature geometry]], [[Accent (phonetics)|accent]], and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].

Phonology also includes topics such as [[phonotactics]] (the phonological constraints on what sounds can appear in what positions in a given language) and [[Alternation (linguistics)|phonological alternation]] (how the pronunciation of a sound changes through the application of [[phonological rule]]s, sometimes in a given order which can be [[feeding order|feeding]] or [[bleeding order|bleeding]],&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith 1995:1.&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], the study of [[suprasegmental]]s and topics such as [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].

The principles of phonological analysis can be applied independently of [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] because they are designed to serve as general analytical tools, not language-specific ones. The same principles have been applied to the analysis of [[sign language]]s (see [[Phoneme#Phonemes in sign languages|Phonemes in sign languages]]), even though the sub-lexical units are not instantiated as speech sounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4085">'''Planning Policy Statements''' (PPS) were [[UK government]] statements of national policy and principles towards certain aspects of the [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|town planning]] framework. In recent years they only  applied to [[England]]. However, they still exist within the Northern Irish System.

They were not legally binding, but the 2004 Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act required that they must be had regard to by authorities preparing development plans, and may be treated as material considerations in the determination of [[planning application]]s. They had gradually been replacing the old style [[Planning Policy Guidance Notes]] (PPG).

In December 2010 the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] announced that all PPSs would be replaced by a single document, the '''[[National Planning Policy Framework]]''' (NPPF). A consultation draft of this new document was published on 25 July 2011. The final version of this document was published on 27 March 2012. It became a material consideration in planning matters on publication.  It replaced all PPSs and all remaining PPGs, plus a number of letters to chief planning officers.

PPS covered the following matters:
*[[PPS 1|Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development]] [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/planningpolicystatement1 PPS1]

'''Purushottam Bhaskar Bhave''' ([[Devanagari]]: पुरुषोत्तम भास्कर भावे) (12 April 1910 &amp;ndash; 13 August 1980)  was a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] writer from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

Bhave lost his mother when he was just nine years old. His father [[Bhaskar Haree Bhave]] was a doctor and was a military doctor. Bhave and his brother were taken by his maternal grandparents to [[Malakapur]] where they grew up. But Bhave was never on good terms with his father, a strict disciplinarian who threw him out of home at least twice.

He received his college education at [[Hislop College]] and [[Law College]] in [[Nagpur]]. Bhave was a fiery political activist of the right-wing, ''[[Hindu]]'' (हिंदुत्ववादी) persuasion. 

In the 1930s, he ran in [[Nagpur]] periodicals "Savdhan" (सावधान) and "Adesh" (आदेश), promoting his political views. Immediately after partition Bhave had been to riots affected [[Noakhali]] in [[East Bengal]]. He stayed there for about six months and maintained a diary interviewing riot affected people. It was his wish to publish it but could not publish it. Bhave was prosecuted for being responsible for [[Bhiwandi riots]] by [[Government of Maharashtra]]. But he fought the case with the help of [[Ramakant Ovalekar]], a senior lawyer and won the case. Being activist of Right wing he was almost boycotted by government for ever.

He wrote scripts of some Marathi movies like ''Rayagadcha Rajabandi'' and played small roles in movies like ''[[Ammaldar]]''. He was a close friend of [[Raja Badhe]], [[Gajanan Digambar Madgulkar]], and [[Govinrao Talawalkar]]. In fact, [[Gajanan Digambar Madgulkar]] used to call him his 'Guru'.

He was elected president of [[Marathi Sahitya Sammelan]] in [[Pune]] in 1977. He was elected president of [[Natya Sammelan]] in [[Ahmednagar|Nagar]].

==Authorship==

'''Ratagnon''' (also translated as '''Latagnon''' or '''Datagnon,''' and '''Aradigi''') is a [[regional language]] spoken by the [[Ratagnon|Ratagnon people]], an indigenous group from [[Occidental Mindoro]]. It is a part of the [[Visayan languages|Visayan language family]] and is closely related to other [[Philippine languages]]. Its speakers are shifting to [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and it is nearly [[extinct language|extinct]].

Barbian (1977) provides lexical and phonological data for Ratagnon.

In contrast to Cuyonon, Ratagnon dropped the schwa /ë/ sound, instead opting for a “u/o” sound. It too borrowed lexical terms from the languages of its Mangyan neighbors and to a lesser extent Spanish (It is notable in Barbian's "Mangyan - English Vocabulary", 1977 that by that time, Ratagnon might have already experienced heavy Tagalization, present in words such as "heart", "tagiposon" in Cuyonon, albeit "puso" in Ratagnon, same with Tagalog's "puso". The word "why", "ayamo" in Cuyonon is noted as "bakit" and "basi" in Ratagnon, "bakit" being a loan from Tagalog and "basi" a Hanunuo Ambahan term (hayga being non-Ambahan), perhaps inferring that "basi" is a loan from Ratagnon, as Ambahans have been known to use archaic Hanunuo terms and loans from various languages, one being Ratagnon. This phenomenon is also observed in the Hanunuo traditions of Urukay, perhaps closely related to the Erekay of the Cuyonons, both being a form of "Balagtasan". Ratagnon also have terms specific to their lowland river surroundings which are not present in modern Cuyonon, most of which are borrowings from Hanunuo and Buhid, whereas a few are either archaic Cuyonon terms or innovations made within the Ratagnon language. Aside from the aforementioned differences from the Cuyonon language, the two languages are still very much mutually intelligible.
Differences from Cuyonon would include:

The usage of the "t" sound over the "d" sound, present in:

==Distribution==
According to the ''[[Ethnologue]]'', Ratagnon is spoken in the southernmost extreme tip of Mindoro islands, including the municipalities of [[Magsaysay, Occidental Mindoro|Magsaysay]] and [[Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro|Bulalacao]].
*[[Magsaysay, Occidental Mindoro|Magsaysay]], [[Occidental Mindoro]]
*[[Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro|Bulalacao]], [[Oriental Mindoro]]

Barbian (1977)&lt;ref name="Barbian1977"&gt;Barbian, Karl-Josef. 1977. English-Mangyan vocabulary. Cebu City: University of San Carlos.&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following locations.
*lower Caguray River near Santa Teresa, [[Magsaysay, Occidental Mindoro]]
*San Nicolas, [[Magsaysay, Occidental Mindoro]]
*Bamban, [[Magsaysay, Occidental Mindoro]]

==Classification==
Ratagnon may be closely related to the [[Cuyonon language]], a [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] language spoken in the [[Cuyo Archipelago]] just to the south of [[Mindoro]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www10.gencat.cat/pres_casa_llengues/AppJava/frontend/llengues_detall_print.jsp?id=960&amp;idioma=5{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be brought about by migrations of Cuyonons to the southern tip of Mindoro, akin to their migrations to mainland Palawan, a very much gradual process. It could be inferred that these migrations happened at an earlier date before the migrations to mainland Palawan started (around the mid to late 19th century) due to its diversion from the Cuyonon language (Given that Ratagnon descended from an older language spoken in the general area West of Panay, Ratagnon and Cuyonon are classified under Kuyan), whereas the Cuyonon of mainland Palawan, Calamian and that of the Cuyo itself remain the same language with relatively little dialectal differences.

'''Subbanna R. Ekkundi''' (1923–1995) was a recipient of [[Sahitya Akademi award]], Nation award for teacher and Soviet Land award.

Ekkundi was born in [[Ranebennur]] of [[Haveri district]] in the year 1923.His father was Rangacharya and mother was Rajakka. He was a student of literature at [[Willingdon college, Sangli]].  At Willingdon, [[V. K. Gokak]] and [[R. S. Mugali]] were Ekkundi's  professors. Ekkundi and [[Gangadhar V. Chittal]] from [[Bankikodla-Hanehalli|Hanehalli]] were classmates at Willingdon. After graduating with B.A. (Hons.) Literature in the year 1944, Subbanna Ekkundi joined the [[Anandashram High School, Bankikodla]] as a teacher and retired as Head Master of that institute in 1977. Ekkundi was married to Indira Ekkundi from [[Haveri]].

In 1992, Ekkundi was awarded the [[Sahitya Akademi]] and the [[Karnataka Sahitya Akademi Award for Poetry|Karnataka Sahitya Akademi]] awards for his outstanding poetical work ''Bakulada Hoovugalu'' in [[Kannada]]. His poem ''Ladhak Irali Nepa Irali'' which was written during the Second [[Indo-China war]] was well received. His political sympathies were with the [[Communist party]].  After his retirement, he was given a national award for teaching. He was the author of many works of poetry and short stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Indian Literature, an Anthology|author= K. M.

His ''Ubhaya Bharati'' concerns the famous debate between the Hindu philosophers [[Adi Shankara]] and [[Mandana Mishra]].

In 1970, Ekkundi was given award from the Land of the Soviets.{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason= The Soviet Union?}} [[Kannada University]] at [[Hampi]] conferred a Ph.D. degree to a student on a thesis entitled ''S.

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2013}}

In [[digital signal processing]], '''source separation''' involves the analysis of mixtures of [[Signal (information theory)|signals]]; the objective is to recover the original component signals from a mixture signal. The classical example of a source separation problem is the [[cocktail party problem]], where a number of people are talking simultaneously in a room (for example, at a [[cocktail party]]), and a listener is trying to follow one of the discussions. The human brain can handle this sort of auditory source separation problem, but it is a difficult problem in digital signal processing. This was first analyzed by [[Colin Cherry]].

Several approaches have been proposed for the solution of this problem but development is currently still very much in progress. Some of the more successful approaches are [[principal components analysis]] and [[independent component analysis]], which work well when there are no delays or echoes present; that is, the problem is simplified a great deal. The field of [[computational auditory scene analysis]] attempts to achieve auditory source separation using an approach that is based on human hearing.

The human brain must also solve this problem in real time. In human perception this ability is commonly referred to as [[auditory scene analysis]] or the [[cocktail party effect]].

==Applications==
[[Image:Polyphonic note separation &amp; manipulation.jpg|thumb|polyphonic note separation]]

One of the practical applications being researched in this area is [[medical imaging]] of the brain with [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG). This kind of imaging involves careful measurements of [[magnetic field]]s outside the head which yield an accurate 3D-picture of the interior of the head. However, external sources of [[electromagnetic field]]s, such as a wristwatch on the subject's arm, will significantly degrade the accuracy of the measurement. Applying source separation techniques on the measured signals can help remove undesired artifacts from the signal.

Another application is the separation of [[music]]al signals. For a stereo mix of relatively simple signals it is now possible to make a fairly accurate separation, although some [[Sonic artifact|artifacts]] remain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5241">A '''spoken dialog system''' is a computer system able to converse with a human with voice. It has two essential components that do not exist in a written text [[dialog system]]: a [[speech recognizer]] and a [[text-to-speech]] module (written text dialog systems usually use other input systems provided by an OS). In can be further distinguished from '''command and control''' speech systems that can respond to requests but do not attempt to maintain continuity over time.

==Components==
* An automatic  [[Speech recognizer]] (ASR) decodes speech into text. Domain-specific recognizers can be configured for language designed for a given application. A "cloud" recognizer will be suitable for domains that do not depend on very specific vocabularies. 
* [[Natural language understanding]] transforms a recognition into a concept structure that can drive system behavior. Some approaches will combine recognition and understanding processing but are thought to be less flexible since interpretation has to be coded into the grammar.
* The [[dialog manager]] controls turn-by-turn behavior. A simple dialog system may ask the user questions then act on the response. Such directed dialog systems use a tree-like structure for control; frame- (or form-) based systems allow for some user initiative and accommodate different styles of interaction. More sophisticated dialog managers incorporate mechanisms for dealing with misunderstandings and clarification.
* The domain reasoner, or more simply the back-end, makes use of a [[knowledge base]] to retrieve information and helps formulate system responses. In simple systems, this may be a database which is queried using information collected through the dialog. The domain reasoner, together with the dialog manager, maintain the context of interaction and allows the system to reflect some human conversational abilities (for example using anaphora). 
* Response generation is similar to text-based [[natural language generation]], but takes into account the needs of spoken communication. This might include the use of simpler grammatical constructions, managing the amount of information in any one output utterance and introducing prosodic markers to help the human participant absorb information more easily. A complete system design will also introduce elements of [[lexical entrainment]], to encourage the human user to favor certain ways of speaking, which in turn can improve recognition performance. 
* [[Text-to-speech]] synthesis (TTS) realizes an intended utterance as speech. Depending on the application, TTS may be based on concatenation of pre-recorded material produced by voice professionals. In more complex applications TTS will use more flexible techniques that accommodate large vocabularies  and that allow the developer control over the character ("personality") of the system.

==Varieties of systems==
Spoken dialog systems vary in their complexity. Directed dialog systems are very simple and require that the developer create a graph (typically a tree) that manages the task but may not correspond to the needs of the user. Information access systems, typically based on forms, allow users some flexibility (for example in the order in which retrieval constraints are specified, or in the use of optional constraints) but are limited in their capabilities. Problem-solving dialog systems may allow human users to engage in a number of different activities that may include information access, plan construction and possible execution of the latter. 

Some examples of systems include: 
* Information access: Weather, trains schedules, stock quotes, directory assistance.
* Transactional: credit card and bank enquiries; ticket purchases.
* Maintenance: Technical support including documentation access and diagnostic testing.
* Tutoring: For education, such as physics or math, and language learning.
* Entertainment and chatting

== History ==
Pionieers in dialogue systems are companies like [[AT&amp;T]] (with its speech recognizer system in the Seventies) and [[CSELT]] laboratories, that led some European research projects during the Eighties (e.g. SUNDIAL) after the end of the DARPA project in the US.

==References==

The field of spoken dialog systems is quite large and includes research (featured at scientific conferences such as [[SIGdial]] and [[Interspeech]]) and a large industrial sector (with its own meetings such as [[SpeechTek]] and [[AVIOS]]).

A '''stomagram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: stoma "mouth," [[-gram]] "drawing"), is a (typically side-view) [[pictogram]] representation of a human [[mouth]], for the sake of diagramming its state during [[speech]] as particular sounds are made. Stomagrams may be cut-away images or simple written character forms, representing the degree the mouth is opened, the position of the lips, and the placement or movement of the [[tongue]].

'''The Emergency''' ({{lang-ga|Ré na Práinne / An Éigeandáil}}) was the [[state of emergency]] which existed in the state of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Spelman2004p60"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spelman|first=Greg|year=2004|title=Ireland's Neutrality Policy in World War II: The Impact of Belligerent Pressures on the Implementation of Neutrality|journal=UCLA Historical Journal|volume=20|pages=60–82: 60|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4262j2gj}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The state of Ireland [[Irish neutrality during World War II|remained neutral]] throughout the war.&lt;ref name="Spelman2004p60" /&gt; "The Emergency" has been used [[metonym]]ically in historical and cultural commentary to refer to the state during the war.&lt;ref name="Spelman2004p60" /&gt; The state of emergency was proclaimed by [[Dáil Éireann]] on 2 September 1939,&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
On 6 December 1922, following the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] that ended the [[Anglo-Irish War|War of Independence]], the island of Ireland became an autonomous [[dominion]], known as the [[Irish Free State]]. On 8 December 1922, the parliament of the six north-eastern counties, already known as [[Northern Ireland]], voted to opt out of the Irish Free State and rejoin the [[United Kingdom]]. This Treaty settlement was immediately followed by the bitter [[Irish Civil War]] between the pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty factions of the [[Irish Republican Army]].

After 1932, the governing party of the new state was the republican ''[[Fianna Fáil]]'', led by [[Éamon de Valera]] (a veteran of both Irish wars and [[Easter Rising]]). In 1937, de Valera introduced a new [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]], which had distanced the state further from the United Kingdom, and which changed its name to "Ireland". In 1932–38 he had also conducted the [[Anglo-Irish Trade War]].

De Valera had good relations with the British [[Prime Minister]], [[Neville Chamberlain]]. He resolved the two countries' economic differences, and negotiated the return of the [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]]—[[Berehaven]], [[Cobh]] and [[Lough Swilly]]—which had remained under British jurisdiction under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921. The major remaining disagreement between the countries was the status of Northern Ireland. The Irish saw it as rightfully Irish territory while the UK saw it as rightfully British territory. Within Ireland itself, armed opposition to the treaty settlement took the name of the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|anti-treaty IRA]], seeing itself as the "true" government of Ireland. This IRA mounted armed attacks both in Great Britain (most notably the [[S-Plan]] in 1939) and Ireland.

==Declaration of the Emergency==
On September 1, 1939, German troops invaded Poland, precipitating war with the UK and France, and their allies. On 2 September, de Valera told the [[Dáil Éireann]] (the lower house of parliament) that neutrality was the best policy for the country. In this he was almost universally supported by the Dáil and the country at large (although many joined the British military).&lt;ref&gt;There was only one vote against neutrality in the Dáil, from [[James Dillon (Fine Gael politician)|James Dillon]], who argued that the State should side with the Allies. He eventually resigned his Dáil seat and from [[Fine Gael]], the main opposition party, because of their support for neutrality. (He rejoined Fine Gael in 1953 and served as their leader from 1959 to 1965.)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1937 [[First Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|constitution was amended]] to allow the Government to take emergency powers, and then the [[Emergency Powers Act 1939]] was passed that included censorship of the press and [[Postal censorship|mail correspondence]]. The government was able to take control of the economic life of the country under the new Minister of Supply [[Seán Lemass]]. Liberal use was made of all of these powers. Internment of those who had committed a crime or were about to commit one would be used extensively against the IRA. Censorship was under the charge of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, [[Frank Aiken]]. It was necessary to prevent publication of matter that might undermine the neutrality of the State and to prevent it becoming a clearing house for foreign intelligence, though over the period of the Emergency, the Act started to be used for more party political purposes such as preventing the publication of the numbers of Irish soldiers serving in the United Kingdom armed forces or industrial disputes within the state.&lt;ref&gt;Girvin, pp.84''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the information made available to Irish people was also carefully controlled. De Valera performed the duties of Minister of External Affairs, though the secretary for the Department of External Affairs, [[Joseph Walshe]], was very influential.

==Neutrality policy==
{{main|Irish neutrality during World War II}}

On the declaration of the emergency, Walshe asked for assurances from the German minister in Dublin, [[Eduard Hempel]] that Germany would not use its legation for espionage nor attack Irish trade with Great Britain. He then travelled to London on 6 September where he met the Dominions Secretary, [[Anthony Eden]], who was conciliatory and defended Irish neutrality in subsequent Cabinet meetings. In addition, the appointment of [[John Maffey, 1st Baron Rugby|Sir John Maffey]] as a British representative in Dublin was agreed.

For the Irish government, neutrality meant not displaying alignment with either side. On one hand, that meant the open announcement of military activity such as the sighting of submarines or the arrival of parachutists, and the suppression of any foreign intelligence activity. Ireland's geographic position meant that this policy (which was, in the view of most historians,{{Who|date=October 2009}} applied fully and consistently) tended to benefit the Allies more than Germany. For example, British airmen who crash-landed in the State were allowed to go free if they could claim not to have been on a combat mission, otherwise they were released "on licence" (promise to remain). Many chose to escape to [[Great Britain]] via [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;All Allied servicemen were released from internment by October 1944 while all Axis servicemen remained at the Curragh. Until 1942, it was not even a technical offence to aid the escape of an internee. Surface ships were excluded from the deal. See Fisk pp.176–177. An example of this policy is the release into Northern Ireland of six officers, including four generals, who had crash-landed in Galway en route from Africa on 15 January 1943. See Duggan p.184. Hempel reported in November 1943 that only eleven out of the forty allied internees remained interned. See Duggan p.171.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Allied mechanics were allowed to retrieve crash-landed Allied aircraft. There was extensive co-operation between British and Irish intelligence and the exchange of information such as detailed weather reports of the Atlantic Ocean; the decision to go ahead with the [[D-day]] landings was influenced by a weather report from [[Blacksod Bay]], [[County Mayo]].&lt;ref&gt;See Duggan p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in the first few years of the war, the government did not show any overt preference for either side. This is partly because de Valera had to keep national unity, which meant accommodating the large swathe of Irish society that rejected anything to do with the British, some of whom admired Germany (which had [[Roger Casement#Irish revolutionary|failed in an attempt to supply a small cache of arms]] to the [[Easter Rising|rebels of 1916]]) to some extent. These attitudes were shared by Aiken&lt;ref&gt;Girvin, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; and by Walshe.&lt;ref&gt;Girvin, p.125. Walshe seemed to be quite comfortable with the largely Catholic government in Vichy France.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fianna Fáil]] government, headed by [[Éamon de Valera]], ruled alone and did not accommodate any other party in decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Girvin, pp.143''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;

==The IRA and the Emergency==
{{Main|Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)}}

In the early months of the emergency, the greatest threat to the State came from the IRA. In the [[Christmas Raid]] in 1939, one million rounds of ammunition were stolen from the [[Irish Army]] by the IRA (though it was mostly recovered in the following weeks)&lt;ref&gt;Girvin, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; and there were a number of killings, mostly of policemen.&lt;ref&gt;There were a number of IRA attacks between 1935 and 1945, including ten murders, mostly between late 1939 and early 1941. Notably, these included the murder of Detective Officer John Roche by Tomás Mac Curtain &lt;!-- Not the wiki-linked one--&gt; in Dublin in January 1940 and of two policemen in August. See Girvin, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the existing emergency legislation was undermined by the obtaining of a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' by [[Seán MacBride]] which resulted in the release of all those who had been interned. The government responded with the 1939 and 1940 [[Offences against the State Acts 1939–1998|Offences Against the State Acts]], which established the [[Special Criminal Court]], and rearrested and interned IRA activists. A hunger strike was started in [[Mountjoy Prison]] in an attempt to gain political status, which collapsed after the death of two prisoners. In retaliation [[Dublin Castle]] was bombed and there were a number of serious incidents throughout the country.

The IRA fostered links with German intelligence (the [[Abwehr]]) and Foreign Ministry, with men such as [[Francis Stuart]] travelling to Germany to talk, though these attempts were largely ineffectual due to a combination of Abwehr and Foreign Ministry incompetence and IRA weakness.&lt;ref&gt;See main article and series on IRA liaisons with Abwehr in World War II [[IRA Abwehr World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt; Germans also came to Ireland, the most notable of whom was [[Hermann Görtz]], who was captured in possession of "[[Plan Kathleen]]"- an IRA plan that detailed a German-supported invasion of [[Northern Ireland]]. (See also: [[Irish Republican Army – Abwehr collaboration in World War II]]).

Two IRA men were executed for the murder of two policemen in September 1940, and the IRA became increasingly ineffective in the face of the resolute use of internment, the breaking of hunger strikes, and the application of [[hanging]] for capital offences. During 1941, the hope of a German invasion had faded and funding from the United States had been cut off. The IRA leadership were mostly interned within the [[Curragh Camp]], where they were treated increasingly harshly, or on the run. Most internees accepted release on [[Prisoners of war parole|parole]]. The IRA [[Northern Campaign (IRA)|remained barely active]] in Northern Ireland, but they were not a threat to the stability of Ireland.

==Ireland and the United Kingdom 1939–1941==
There was a reluctance on the part of the British to accept the policy of Irish neutrality. [[Anthony Eden]], [[Secretary of State for the Dominions|Dominions
Secretary]] in the new British war cabinet, said "we do not want formally to recognise Eire as
neutral while Eire remains a member of the [[British Commonwealth]]" as this he said would be in conflict with the "constitutional theory of the indivisibility of the crown." &lt;ref&gt;Robert Fisk, "In Time of War", pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt; A prevalent view in the UK was that Ireland was obliged to support the UK in the war. Churchill said at the time that "Southern Ireland is at war, but skulking".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour-online/833--winston-churchill-a-eamon-de-valera-a-thirty-year-relationship#sdendnote23sym Churchill Centre Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703212616/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour-online/833--winston-churchill-a-eamon-de-valera-a-thirty-year-relationship |date= 3 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Norwegian campaign|German invasion of Norway]] in April 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] became the British [[Prime Minister]]. The [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in June 1940 brought the war close to [[Ireland]], as German troops occupied the French coastline across the [[Celtic Sea]].

The United Kingdom was now the only major impediment to Germany. A major British concern was now whether Germany would invade Ireland. The British view was that the Irish Army was not powerful enough to resist an invasion for long enough for reinforcement from the UK, particularly with the IRA as a potential [[fifth column]], and wished to be able to forestall this by stationing troops and ships within the Irish state. In addition, this view made the UK reluctant to provide military supplies because of the risk of their falling into German hands after an invasion. The Irish government's view was that they would be more successful against the Germans than the states already occupied, and there could be no agreement for joint military measures while partition continued, and would not commit themselves beyond neutrality for the whole island should it end.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Unification refused===
{{main|Partition of Ireland}}

By June 1940, the British representative in Ireland, Maffey, was urging that "the strategic unity of our island group" should take precedence over Ulster Unionism, and Churchill was making clear that there should be no military action taken against Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Girvin, pp.108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Minister for Health, [[Malcolm MacDonald]], who had negotiated the 1938 [[Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement|trade agreement]] with Ireland whilst [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]], was sent to Dublin to explore possibilities with De Valera. From these Chamberlain produced a six-point proposal that committed the UK government to a united Ireland and proposed the setting-up of a joint body to effect this. A Joint Defence Council would be set up immediately and the State provided with military equipment. In return the State would join the Allies and intern all German and Italian aliens. Rejected by the Irish government, the proposal was then amended to strengthen the steps towards a united Ireland, and no longer requiring Ireland to join the war, but only to invite British forces to use Irish bases and ports. De Valera rejected the revised proposal on 4 July and made no counter proposal. One reason for this would have been the difficult calculation of how damaging the inevitable split in Ireland would be if such a proposal was accepted. One of the main reasons was that the Irish Government thought that the UK would lose the war and did not want to be on the losing side: during the negotiations Walshe had produced two memoranda for De Valera (one entitled ''Britain's Inevitable Defeat''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.difp.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=3196 Memorandum, Walshe to de Valera from Joseph P. Walshe to Joseph P. Walshe – 21 June 1940], at the Documents on Irish Foreign Policy website&lt;/ref&gt;) predicting the isolation of Great Britain, the dismemberment of its empire, and finally its inevitable crushing by Germany. Walshe also wrote approvingly of the character of the [[Vichy France|Pétain government]].&lt;ref&gt;Girvin, pp.124–125&lt;/ref&gt; Walshe's memoranda affected de Valera, with him telling MacDonald that Great Britain ''could not destroy this [German] colossal machine''.&lt;ref&gt;Girvin, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, from May 1940, Walshe and Col Liam Archer of [[Irish Military Intelligence]] discussed the defence of Ireland in the event of a German invasion with counterparts in Northern Ireland and a general strategic plan for UK military action [[Plan W|"Plan W"]] across the border "if invited" was developed.

===Ports and shipping===

{{Main|Irish Mercantile Marine during World War II}}

The great majority of Ireland's trade was with the United Kingdom, and most of its supplies came from there. This created great difficulties for the Irish government as Germany tried to blockade the UK. Additionally the UK required Irish ships to operate under their '[[Blockade of Germany (1939–45)#The Navicert|navicert]]' system. In September 1940, a joint agreement on trade, shipping and exports fell through, "the main sticking point between the two sides was the prices on offer from Britain" &lt;ref&gt;Griven, p 162&lt;/ref&gt; owing to the refusal to allow [[transshipment]] and repair facilities following German pressure, including the threat to blockade Ireland and the bombing of [[Ambrosetown]] and [[Campile]] in [[County Wexford]].&lt;ref&gt;Duggan p. 112, p. 132, Girvin p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1940, the threat of German invasion had receded, but relations between the UK and Ireland deteriorated, largely as a result of the increased losses of Allied shipping to [[U-boat]] attack. To try to prevent some of these losses, the UK wanted sea and air bases in western Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;In the end, probably at [[Lough Swilly]] and the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] estuary rather than the Treaty Ports, Girvin, p.175.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November, in the House of Commons, Churchill complained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that we cannot use the South and West coasts of Ireland to refuel our flotillas and aircraft and thus protect the trade by which Ireland as well as Great Britain lives, is a most heavy and grievous burden and one which should never have been placed on our shoulders, broad though they may be.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Irish Government chose to interpret this sentence as a threat of invasion. Some sort of armed occupation was a real possibility,&lt;ref&gt;The UK had occupied [[Iceland]] in May 1940&lt;/ref&gt; but the balance of evidence is that there was never a serious threat.&lt;ref&gt;Girvin pp. 171 ''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; Large elements of the British cabinet and government and those of its allies were opposed to any armed intervention in Ireland; however, in late 1940 and early 1941, relations between the two countries did worsen. The British stopped informing Ireland of its order of battle in Northern Ireland, while the Irish Army drew up plans for defence against the British. The United Kingdom also started to restrict trade to Ireland, reasoning that if Ireland would not do anything to protect the lives of those bringing in supplies, it should at least share in the deprivations being felt in the UK. Relations between the UK and Ireland only really eased in the middle of 1941 with the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]] by Germany and an agreement to allow Irish immigration to Britain to work in the war industries, resulting in up to 200,000 Irish people doing so by 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Girvin p.179&lt;/ref&gt;

===The economy===
Only since 2000 has the wartime Irish economy been studied,{{according to whom|date=December 2014}} away from the grander issues of diplomacy and warfare. Being still largely dependent on Britain for coal, manufactured goods and fuel oils, supplies of these were reduced after the fall of France in mid-1940, causing price inflation and a busy [[black market]]. It was said that "the poor are like hunted rats looking for bread", as wheat supplies fell, and that the introduction of full rationing was "seriously belated". [[Typhus]] reappeared and the government started planning for famine relief in late 1941. [[John Betjeman]], the British press attaché in Dublin, reported "No coal. No petrol. No gas. No electric. No paraffin. Guinness good." In March 1942 the government banned the export of beers, and decided that more wheat should be grown, and less barley. The prospect of a shortage of beer led on to [[barter]] deals whereby Britain supplied wheat suitable for making [[Wheat flour|bread flour]], and coal, and in return Ireland allowed the export of beers. "These supplies were to keep neutral Ireland afloat during World War II and enable the continuance of Irish neutrality".&lt;ref&gt;Evans B, "A pint of plain is your only man", essay in [[History Ireland]], vol22 no5, pp36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland and the neutral United States==
At the beginning of the Second World War, the [[United States President]] was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]. The United States was neutral, and Roosevelt's actions were circumscribed by neutrality legislation; however, Roosevelt was a vehement anti-Nazi, an unequivocal supporter of the UK in the war, and personally close to Churchill. The US minister to Ireland was [[David Gray (ambassador)|David Gray]], a personal friend of Roosevelt and his wife [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Eleanor]]. De Valera saw the US as a bulwark against invasion from any party, while the US saw the support of Britain in the war as the priority, and so while supportive of Irish neutrality was sceptical of it extending over the whole island and wanted an arrangement to be made with the UK over ports, possibly through the leasing of them.&lt;ref&gt;Girvin, p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale of arms was a major issue. The declaration of war legally impeded the US from selling any arms to belligerents under the laws in force at the time; this led to Ireland being briefly considered as a possible conduit for arms sales to circumvent the law. However, in November 1939 Congress agreed to change the law to allow the sale of arms to all belligerents on a "cash and carry" basis. Nevertheless, the Irish government wanted the US to sell them arms. This was supported by Gray, and by the British government, but only if not at the expense of their own allocation. As a result, in 1940 all surplus US arms were sold to the UK and [[Canada]].

The strong support of the UK by the Roosevelt administration led the Irish government to try to bolster anti-Roosevelt isolationist opinion in the November 1940 presidential election and a [[Christmas]] radio broadcast by de Valera to the US supporting isolationism. An attempt to influence Roosevelt's special emissary, [[Wendell Willkie]], on a visit to Great Britain and Ireland January 1941, failed. In a further attempt to obtain arms from the US de Valera decided that Aiken should visit Washington. Gray supported the idea of a visit, but had doubts over whether Aiken was the right person to make it, and stressed that the Irish were only likely to obtain arms if they co-operated with the [[British Purchasing Commission]]. Aiken left Ireland in March 1941. For his St Patrick's day address, de Valera claimed that Ireland was under blockade from both sides and that neutrality protected Ireland from "the hazards of imperial adventure". Aiken's visit was disastrous.&lt;ref&gt;Girvin pp.208 ''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; His anti-British views and, in American eyes, overestimation of Ireland's military capabilities went across all the administration's policies towards the war. As well as alienating Roosevelt and other members of the administration, he failed to use the letters of introduction to senior [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], including Eleanor Roosevelt, provided to him by Gray. Aiken spent the last seven weeks of his visit on what was seen as an anti-administration speaking tour, associating closely with isolationist opinion. The result was that the US would not sell any armaments to the State, and relations between the two countries significantly worsened, the US becoming even more unequivocal in its support of the UK. In October 1941 on receiving a note from the Irish government asking for its intentions with regard to Northern Ireland on the stationing of personnel associated with lend-lease, the US State Department referred them to the British government as Northern Ireland was, they insisted, part of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Girvin p.287&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant events==

===Belfast Blitz===
{{Main|Belfast blitz}}

Meanwhile, Northern Ireland (as part of the [[United Kingdom]]) was at war and the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyards in [[Belfast]] were among the strategic targets for German attack. The [[Luftwaffe]] carried out a bombing raid on Belfast on 7 April 1941; eight people died. On 15 April 1941, 180 Luftwaffe bombers attacked Belfast. There was only one [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] squadron and seven [[anti-aircraft]] batteries to defend Belfast.&lt;!--date=Autumn, 1997--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barton|first1=Brian|title=The Belfast Blitz: April–May 1941|journal=History Ireland|volume=5|issue=3|pages=52–57|jstor=27724486|quote=Due in large part to earlier ministerial neglect and prevarication, local active and passive defences were hopelessly inadequate, and the public physically and psychologically unprepared for the blitz.|subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200 tons of explosives, 80 landmines attached to parachutes and 800 firebomb canisters were dropped. Over 1,000 died and 56,000 houses (more than half of the city's housing stock) were damaged leaving 100,000 temporarily homeless. At 4.30 &lt;small&gt;AM&lt;/small&gt; [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Basil Brooke]] asked [[Éamon de Valera|de Valera]] for assistance. Within two hours, 13 [[fire apparatus|fire tender]]s from [[Dublin]], [[Drogheda]], [[Dundalk]] and [[Dún Laoghaire]] were on their way to cross the Irish border to assist their Belfast colleagues. De Valera followed up with his "they are our people" speech. Although there was a later raid on 4 May, it was confined to the docks and shipyards.

===Dublin bombing===
{{Main|Bombing of Dublin in World War II}}
In early January 1941, there had been several minor German bombings of Irish territory. There were three deaths in [[Borris, County Carlow|Borris]], [[County Carlow]] and other incidents in [[Wexford]], Dublin and at the [[Curragh]]. The public mood was already agitated, fearing a German invasion and the implications of the bombings added to the concern. So as not to antagonise the Germans further, the Irish authorities initially declined to confirm that the bombs were German. Public speculation, and IRA claims, that the bombs were British, or German but released by British aircraft, later prompted Irish Government denials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wills | first = Claire | title = That Neutral Island | publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] | year = 2007 | location = London | pages = 208–210 | isbn = 978-0-571-22105-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 30/31 May 1941, Dublin's [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside]] was the target of a [[Luftwaffe]] air raid. Thirty-eight were killed and seventy houses were destroyed on Summerhill Parade, [[North Strand]] and the North Circular Road. Unlike the earlier bombing incidents, there was no public speculation that the perpetrators were anyone other than the Luftwaffe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=That Neutral Island|last=Wills|first=Claire|publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-571-22105-9|location=London|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish government promptly protested and Germany apologised claiming that high winds were to blame or there had been British interference with navigation signals. [[Winston Churchill]] later conceded that the raids might have been the result of a British invention which [[Battle of the Beams|distorted Luftwaffe radio guidance beams]] so as to throw their planes off course.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Pat Coogan ''de Valera ‘long fellow, short shadow’'' p. 585&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph T. Carroll ''“Ireland in the War Years”'' p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Dublin had limited [[blackout (wartime)|blackout]] regulations at the time, so the city was clearly visible, unlike British cities.

On 3 October, the German news agency announced that the [[Nazi Germany|German government]] would pay compensation, but only [[West Germany]] paid this after the war, using [[Marshall Aid]] money.

===The Allies and neutrality===
*In June 1940, to encourage the neutral Irish state to join with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], [[Winston Churchill]] indicated to the [[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] that the United Kingdom would push for Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de Valera declined the offer.&lt;ref&gt;"Anglo-Irish Relations, 1939–41: A Study in Multilateral Diplomacy and Military Restraint" in ''Twentieth Century British History'' (Oxford Journals, 2005), {{ISSN|1477-4674}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British did not inform the Government of [[Northern Ireland]] that they had made the offer to the Dublin government, and De Valera's rejection was not publicised until 1970.
* When, in 1941, the Irish police discovered "[[Operation Green (Ireland)|Operation Green]]" in a residence where German agent [[Hermann Görtz]] had been staying, the Irish promptly passed copies to [[MI5]] in [[London]], who in turn forwarded them to the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) in Belfast. Joint plans of action were then drawn up between the British and Irish intelligence services and military under [[Plan W]].
* General [[Daniel McKenna (general)|McKenna]], the Irish Army's Chief of Staff, regularly visited British officers in Belfast and in 1942 twelve Irish officers undertook training with British special forces in [[Poyntzpass]], County Armagh. Cooperation did not end there and also included the British signalling through [[General Post Office|GPO]] lines when it believed German planes were headed towards Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;See Fisk pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;
* From December 1940 onwards the Dublin Government agreed to accept over 2000 British [[evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|women and children evacuated from London]] due to "[[The Blitz]]". These evacuees included over two hundred children orphaned by the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;The British paid for the food and clothing allowance of the orphans, but the Irish paid for their lodgings, attempts were also made to have the British pay for their hospital treatment, but it was dropped when the request was "unfavourably received" in London. See Fisk pp.175–176&lt;/ref&gt;
* Attacks on Irish vessels, such as that on the [[MV Kerlogue|''Kerlogue'']], which the British had initially attributed to the Germans, but later admitted responsibility for and offered to pay compensation when fragments of British ammunition were discovered embedded in the ship.&lt;ref&gt;see Duggan p.173&lt;/ref&gt; The ship had been attacked by aircraft [[No. 307 Polish Night Fighter Squadron]], after being mistaken for a French vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/30/a6848030.shtml |title=WW2 People's War — They served neither King nor Führer but humanity |work=BBC |accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* De Valera protested vociferously to the American Government about its "invasion of Ireland" when U.S. troops had landed in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;(1997, Hawley) ''John D Kearney and Irish Canadian relations during World War II'' Heather J Hawley, University of Western Ontario&lt;/ref&gt;
* On the death of President Roosevelt, de Valera made arrangements for a commemoration service in [[St Mary's Pro-Cathedral|St Mary's (Catholic) Pro-Cathedral]]. The Ambassador, [[David Gray (ambassador)|David Gray]], said that he would not attend unless it was held in [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's (Church of Ireland) Cathedral, Dublin]]. Walsh tried to contact the Ambassador, but was told that Gray was unavailable. Neither service was held. Since the Ambassador would be unavailable to receive condolences, de Valera sent his secretary to deliver his condolences rather than trying to deliver them in person. De Valera then instructed that flags be lowered to half-mast as a mark to respect to the late President.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The Axis and neutrality===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Curragh.jpg|thumb|right|The survivors of {{ship|German destroyer|Z27||2}}, ''T25'' and ''T26'' interned in the Curragh]] --&gt;

* [[Germany|German]] pilots, aircrew and naval personnel who were discovered in Ireland were always interned and remained so for the duration of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Irish Defence Department, there were "no International Conventions specifically governing the treatment of belligerent internees and accordingly it appears open to neutral States ... to prescribe conditions of internment in whatever manner they think fit." This is why the Irish felt they could release British pilots but retain German ones. See Fisk pp. 176–177. De Valera argued that blow by blow parity returning German aircrews to German could not take place as they could bring back militarily valuable information. See Duggan p.185 although Hempel was to find out in 1943 that the Irish had been negotiating with the British over returning German internees. See Duggan p.171.&lt;/ref&gt; One German prisoner was shot while attempting to escape from [[Oldcastle, County Meath|Oldcastle]] prison camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Fergus |last=d'Arcy |title=Remembering the war dead |year=2007 |isbn=0-7557-7589-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 1940, three German [[Abwehr]] agents were arrested outside [[Skibbereen]] after landing near [[Castletownshend]], [[County Cork]]. The agents' mission had been to infiltrate Britain via Ireland.
* [[Ralph Ingersoll (PM publisher)|Ralph Ingersoll]], who visited Britain in late 1940, wrote that year that "Many informed people in Great Britain suspect that the [[German U-boats|[German] submarines]] are using bases in Ireland. There are many stories of submarine crews being seen in the cafés in Dublin out of uniform."&lt;ref name="ingersoll1940"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ReportOnEngland#page/n211/mode/2up |title=Report on England, November 1940 |last=Ingersoll |first=Ralph |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1940 |location=New York |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The chief [[Abwehr]] spy in Ireland was [[Hermann Görtz]]. Approximately 12 spies were deployed, mostly with little success, including [[Günther Schütz]], Ernst Weber-Drohl (a former circus strongman) and Henry Obed, an Indian.
* The activities of German agents in Ireland throughout the war years and their attempts to contact and court both [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|Irish Republican Army]] and disaffected Irish Army personnel — many of these agents, if not all, were captured/exposed; ''see'' [[Irish Republican Army – Abwehr collaboration in World War II]].
* The German ambassador at the German Legation in Dublin, [[Eduard Hempel]], had his [[radio]] confiscated in 1943 to prevent him from passing information to his leaders.&lt;ref&gt;This is thought to have occurred at the insistence of the American forces stationed in Northern Ireland. Hempel had been relaying Irish Army strength and troop movements to Berlin throughout the war, and he is also thought to have relayed weather reports to the German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German warship|Gneisenau||2}} in February 1942. The British military had been intercepting and logging his transmissions. See Duggan p.180&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[U-boat]] torpedo attack which sank the vessel {{SS|Irish Oak|1919|6}} on 19 May 1943. De Valera said that "it was a wanton and inexcusable act. There was no possibility of a mistake, the conditions of visibility were good and the neutral markings on our ships were clear. There was no warning given."&lt;ref&gt;See Duggan p. 185. In most cases, each Irish ship had "Éire" painted in large lettering on the side and decking, and flew the [[Flag of Ireland]]. Irish ships sunk by U-boat included the ''Munster'', the ''Kerry Head'', the ''City of Limerick'' and the SS '' Kyleclare''. The ''City of Bremen'' was sunk by German planes south-west of [[Mizen Head]] on 2 June 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "North Strand Bombing" on 31 May 1941&lt;ref&gt;See Duggan p.112 &amp; p.132&lt;/ref&gt; and others that took place in Malin, [[County Donegal]] on 5 May 1941, and [[Arklow]] on 1 June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;See Duggan p.135.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repeated attempts to offer captured British weaponry to de Valera if he would side with the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;See Duggan pp.131–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with Germany==
In pursuit of its policy of neutrality, the Irish Government refused to close the German and Japanese embassies. In 1939, the German Government had very little intelligence on Ireland and Britain. This is because Hitler had hoped for a [[détente]] or alliance with Britain, whom he considered the "natural allies" of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler was a big fan of the British and their Empire, some recollections here {{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWsealoin.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427171310/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWsealoin.htm |archivedate=27 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; When concerted efforts to build a reliable picture of British military strength did begin around 1939–1940, efforts were first made to infiltrate spies to Britain via Ireland, but these attempts consistently failed (see [[Operation Lobster]] and [[Operation Seagull (Ireland)|Operation Seagull]]). The Abwehr also made attempts to foster intelligence gathering links with the IRA, but found that the IRA was in no condition to be of serious use — these attempts were to occur during the period 1939–1943. The German military also drew up plans detailing how an invasion of Ireland might take place. These plans were titled [[Operation Green (Ireland)|Plan Green]] and any invasion was to act as a diversionary attack in support of a main attack to conquer Britain titled [[Operation Sea Lion]]. Both of these plans were shelved by 1942. When [[United States Army|US Army]] troops began to be stationed in Northern Ireland in 1942, Plan Green was reprinted because there was a fear amongst the German High Command (and the Irish Government) that the US Army might attempt an invasion of Ireland, following its [[occupation of Iceland]] (after the British invasion) and [[History of Greenland during World War II|Greenland]] in 1941. These fears led to another German intelligence plan – [[Operation Osprey]] – but it was abandoned when the feared American invasion failed to take place.

The British also had a plan to occupy the entire Island as a response to any attempted German invasion. They had always sought to privately reassure de Valera that any invasion by their troops would be by invitation only. This scheme was titled [[Plan W]] and intricate details were worked out with the Irish government and military over how to react to a German invasion. The Irish military shared details of their defences and military capabilities with the British and troops stationed in Northern Ireland. The reassurances from the British did not altogether console de Valera however, and he was frequently suspicious, while German forces still threatened Britain, that the British might invade the territory of the State. He did not know that the [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|Craigavon]], was urging London to seize the port at [[Cobh]], or that attempts had been made to split the consensus over the Neutrality policy. Concessions such as relaxing of the claim on [[Lough Swilly]] to allow British navy and airforce patrols did go some way to easing the tension. As the war turned against [[Nazi Germany]] in their eastern campaign, and as the Abwehr became less and less effective, around 1943–1944, operations in the island of Ireland ceased to be of interest to the German Government and military and therefore the British. Overall, during the period the focus of de Valera was maintaining Irish neutrality. The Irish authorities' pursuit of an aggressive campaign of internment against the IRA, including raising the [[Local Security Force]] (LSF), executions, and aggressive action by [[Directorate of Intelligence (Ireland)|Irish Military Intelligence (G2)]] meant that the activities of the German Legation in Dublin were supervised closely and attempts to infiltrate spies into the country were quickly discovered.

On the occasion of the [[death of Adolf Hitler]], de Valera paid a controversial visit to Hempel to express sympathy with the German people over the death of the [[Führer]].&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Taoiseach Éamon de Valera's visit to the German Legation, 2 May 1945 from the National Archives of Ireland available here [http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/AAE/commentary.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; This action has been defended as proper given the state's neutrality. Sir John Maffey, the British Representative, commented that de Valera's actions were "unwise but mathematically consistent".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Hyde]], Ireland's president, also sent condolences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press in Dublin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/secondworldwar/story/0,14058,1675795,00.html |title=President sent sympathy on Hitler's death &amp;#124; Special reports &amp;#124; Guardian Unlimited |publisher=Guardian |date= 31 December 2005|accessdate=2010-04-30 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; an action which enraged the United States minister&lt;ref&gt;"Minister" was the title of the US ambassador. See: [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Ireland#Envoys]]&lt;/ref&gt; as no similar action had taken place on the death of the United States President, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

===Attitudes to the Holocaust===
{{See also|History of the Jews in Ireland}}

Elements of Irish public opinion were markedly different in their treatment of the [[Axis powers]]. A ''[[Limerick Leader]]'' editorial in 1945 noted that, "The campaign against war criminals is strangely confined to those who happen to fight on the wrong side." However it continued to say that &lt;blockquote&gt;Allied atrocities cannot excuse the monstrous barbarism of the Reich.&lt;ref&gt;In Kilkenny in 1945, a letter to a local newspaper declared that newsreel footage of Belsen was "all propaganda" and had been faked by the British using starving Indians. Also in Kilkenny the first prize in a fancy dress ball went to "the Beast of Belsen".See Fisk, Robert "In Time of War" pp. 430–431 for details on Anti-semitism in Kilkenny &amp; Limerick.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to some sources, it appears that there was official indifference from the political establishment to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust during and after the war. This was despite De Valera having knowledge of the crimes committed against Jewish victims of the [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] as early as 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Girvin, 'De Valera's Diplomatic Neutrality', ''History Today'', '''56'''(3), p.50 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources report that De Valera was so aware in 1942 and the government sought to secure the release of Jews from then.&lt;ref&gt;"In 1942 Rabbi Herzog warned De Valera that Jews were being systematically exterminated in German prison camps. The Taoiseach and his government made efforts to rescue various groups, especially groups including children, and bring them to Ireland. These included a large group of German Jews held at Vittel in Vichy France, who already possessed visas for various South American countries. De Valera, together with the Irish ministers in Berlin, Vichy, and at the Vatican worked to rescue the Vittel Jews, and later groups of Italian, Dutch, Hungarian, and Slovakian Jews, but without success. In no case were the Nazis willing to let such groups depart for Ireland or leave Europe under Irish auspices. There was also a mistaken belief that Jews with Irish visas might be imprisoned, but would not be sent to the death camps, a belief the Vittel episode destroyed." From Judaism: A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought, Summer, 1999, The Jews of Ireland. Robert Tracy&lt;/ref&gt; After the war had ended, Jewish groups had difficulty in getting refugee status for Jewish children – whilst at the same time, a plan to bring over four hundred Catholic children from the Rhineland encountered no difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Keogh, Dermot, "Jews in Twentieth-Century Ireland: Refugees, Anti-Semitism and the Holocaust" pp. 209–210. The plan to bring over Catholic German children was known as [[Operation Shamrock]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Justice explained in 1948 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has always been the policy of the Minister for Justice to restrict the admission of Jewish aliens, for the reason that any substantial increase in our Jewish population might give rise to an anti-Semitic problem.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Justice Memorandum 'Admission of One Hundred Jewish children' 28 April 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, De Valera over-ruled the Department of Justice and the 150 refugee Jewish children were brought to Ireland in 1948. Earlier, in 1946, 100 Jewish children from Poland were brought to Clonyn Castle in County Meath by a London Jewish charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive2/ireland/ireland.htm Anti-semitism in Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121132915/http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive2/ireland/ireland.htm |date=21 November 2007 }} Institute for Jewish Policy Research and American Jewish Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish victims of the Holocaust===
Esther Steinberg and her Paris-born, Belgian-fathered son Leon were the only Irish victims of the Holocaust, dying in [[Auschwitz]] having been transported there from Paris in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Nicola |title=Looking back ...

==The Emergency after the end of World War II==
De Valera's reluctance to recognise a difference between World War II and previous European wars was illustrated by his reply to a radio broadcast by the [[British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]] on [[V-E Day]]. Churchill praised Britain's restraint in not occupying Ireland to secure the Western Approaches during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the approaches which the southern Irish ports and airfields could so easily have guarded were closed by the hostile aircraft and U-boats. This indeed was a deadly moment in our life, and if it had not been for the loyalty and friendship of Northern Ireland, we should have been forced to come to close quarters with Mr. de Valera, or perish from the earth. However, with a restraint and poise to which, I venture to say, history will find few parallels, His Majesty’s Government never laid a violent hand upon them, though at times it would have been quite easy and quite natural, and we left the de Valera Government to frolic with the German and later with the [[Japan]]ese representatives to their heart’s content.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

De Valera replied to Churchill in another radio broadcast, which was popular when broadcast in Ireland:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferriter|first1=Diarmaid|title=Judging Dev|date=2007|publisher=RIA|location=Dublin|isbn=9781904890287|page=258|quote=De Valera's response to Churchill's insulting broadcast at the end of the war was masterful and did much to secure his 'father figure' status.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Allowances can be made for Mr. Churchill’s statement, however unworthy, in the first flush of victory. No such excuse could be found for me in this quieter atmosphere. There are, however, some things it is essential to say. I shall try to say them as dispassionately as I can. Mr. Churchill makes it clear that, in certain circumstances, he would have violated our neutrality and that he would justify his actions by Britain’s necessity. It seems strange to me that Mr. Churchill does not see that this, if accepted, would mean that Britain's necessity would become a moral code and that when this necessity became sufficiently great, other people’s rights were not to count... that is precisely why we had this disastrous succession of wars — World War No.1 and World War No.2 — and shall it be World War No.3? Surely Mr. Churchill must see that if his contention be admitted in our regard, a like justification can be framed for similar acts of aggression elsewhere and no small nation adjoining a great Power could ever hope to be permitted to go its own way in peace. It is indeed fortunate that Britain's necessity did not reach the point where Mr. Churchill would have acted. All credit to him that he successfully resisted the temptation which I have no doubt many times assailed him in his difficulties, and to which, I freely admit, many leaders might have easily succumbed. It is indeed hard for the strong to be just to the weak, but acting justly always has its rewards. By resisting his temptation in this instance, Mr. Churchill, instead of adding another horrid chapter to the already bloodstained record of the relations between England and this country, has advanced the cause of international morality — an important step, one of the most important indeed that can be taken on the road to the establishment of any sure basis for peace....
&lt;br/&gt;
Mr. Churchill is proud of Britain’s stand alone, after [[France]] had fallen and before America entered the war. Could he not find in his heart the generosity to acknowledge that there is a small nation that stood alone not for one year or two, but for several hundred years against aggression; that endured spoliations, famine, massacres, in endless succession; that was clubbed many times into insensibility, but each time on returning to consciousness took up the fight anew; a small nation that could never be got to accept defeat and has never surrendered her soul?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Punishment of Irish Army deserters===
{{main|EPO 362}}
Unlike other neutral states, Ireland did not introduce a general prohibition on its citizens opting for foreign enlistment during the war. However, one serious concern of government in this regard was the relatively high number of Irish soldiers deserting and leaving the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hachey|first1=Thomas E.|last2=McCaffrey|first2=Lawrence J|title=The Irish Experience Since 1800: A Concise History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_LQR93gmJQC&amp;pg=PA182 |edition=3rd |year=2010|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-2511-3|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of between 4,000 and 7,000 members of the Irish armed forces deserted to join the armed forces of belligerent nations, the majority serving in the [[British Army]], [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name=canny&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Canny | first = Liam | authorlink = | title = Pariah Dogs: Deserters from the Irish Defence Forces Who Joined the British Armed Forces during 'The Emergency' | journal = Studia Hibernica | volume = | issue = 30 | pages = 231–249 | publisher = | date = 1998 | url = | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 1945, [[Minister for Defence (Ireland)|Minister for Defence]] [[Oscar Traynor]] stated that he proposed introducing legislation which would deprive deserters of any right "for a long time to come" to employment paid for from public funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Ceisteanna—Questions. Oral Answers. – Army Absentees. | journal = Dáil Éireann Debate | volume = 97 | issue = 6 | page = 13 | publisher = | date = 17 May 1945 | url = http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1945/05/17/00013.asp| doi =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation in question was the [[EPO 362|Emergency Powers (No. 362) order]] which was passed on 8 August 1945. This punished those who had deserted during the Emergency in four ways:

* Deserters forfeited all pay and allowances for the period of their absence
* They lost any rights to pensions they might have earned due to their years of service
* They lost any entitlement to unemployment benefits normally available to former members of the Irish Army
* For a period of seven years they could not qualify for any employment remunerated from public funds

The Order only applied to personnel who had been called to active duty during the Emergency or who had enlisted "for the duration" of the Emergency and affected 4,000 men.&lt;ref name=ded19451018&gt;{{Cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Emergency Powers (362) Order, 1945 —Motion to Annual. | journal = Dáil Éireann Debate | volume = 98 | issue = 4 | page = 27 | publisher = | date = 18 October 1945 | url = http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1945/10/18/00027.asp| doi =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's reasons for passing the order have been given as follows:&lt;ref name=canny/&gt;

* To ensure that those personnel who had faithfully served the country in the defence forces had first chance of obtaining jobs with state and local authorities following demobilisation
* To deter future desertion
* To allow deserters to be dealt with in a cost-effective and expeditious way, rather than go the immense expense of court-martialling each man individually

On 18 October 1945 [[Thomas F. O'Higgins]] moved to annul the order.&lt;ref name=ded19451018/&gt; He did not condone desertion, but felt that the order was specifically awarding harsh punishment to those deserters who had served in the Allied forces. [[Richard Mulcahy|General Richard Mulcahy]] also spoke against the Order, disagreeing with the way in which it applied to enlisted men and not to officers. However, despite the arguments put forward by O'Higgins and Mulcahy, the Dáil voted in favour of the order.

An amnesty was enacted in the Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Act 2013, which admitted that the penalties were 'now considered to have been unduly harsh' and offered an apology to those affected. The Minister of Defence, [[Alan Shatter]], commented that it 'was a tribute to how far we had come as a society that such a sensitive issue could get practically unanimous support from all sides in the Dáil'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0507/390710-soldier-amnesty/] RTÉ News, May 2013: 'Apology and amnesty for World War II soldiers who were branded deserters'&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1995 [[John Bruton|Taoiseach John Bruton]] paid tribute to those who "volunteered to fight against Nazi tyranny in Europe, at least 10,000 of whom were killed while serving in British uniforms. In recalling their bravery, we are recalling a shared experience of Irish and British people. We remember a British part of the inheritance of all who live in Ireland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Girvin|first=Brian|author2=Geoffrey Roberts |year=1998|title=The Forgotten Volunteers of World War II|journal=History Ireland|publisher=History Publications Ltd|volume=6|issue=1|page=51|url=http://www.historyireland.com/volumes/volume6/issue1/features/?id=181|accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Transcribe Bentham''''' is a [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] manuscript transcription project, run by [[University College London]]'s Bentham Project,&lt;ref&gt;University College London's Bentham Project, http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bentham-project&lt;/ref&gt; in partnership with [[UCL Centre for Digital Humanities]], UCL Library Services, UCL Learning and Media Services, the [[University of London Computer Centre]], and the online community. ''Transcribe Bentham'' was launched under a twelve-month [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] grant.

For two years from October 2012, the project is funded by a grant from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]'s 'Scholarly Communications' programme, and the project consortium has been expanded to include the [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/2012/07/02/bentham-project-receives-grant-from-the-mellon-foundation/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
''Transcribe Bentham'' was launched in September 2010. The project makes available, via a transcription interface based on a customised [[MediaWiki]], high-quality digital images of UCL's vast collection of unpublished manuscripts written and composed by the philosopher and reformer, [[Jeremy Bentham]], which runs to some 60,000 manuscript folios (an estimated 30,000,000 words). Under the Mellon Foundation grant, almost all of the UCL Bentham Papers will be digitised, along with all of the British Library's own collection of Bentham manuscripts, some 12,500 manuscript folios (or an estimated 6,000,000 words).

The project recruits volunteers to assist in transcribing the material, and thereby contribute to the Bentham Project's production of the new edition of ''[[The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham]]''. Volunteer-produced transcripts are also uploaded to UCL's digital Bentham Papers repository,&lt;ref&gt;UCL's digital Bentham Papers collection, http://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/bentham&lt;/ref&gt; in order to widen access to the collection, and ensure its long-term preservation.

==Transcription==
Volunteers can sign-up for a user account at the Transcription Desk.&lt;ref&gt;''Transcribe Bentham'' Transcription Desk, http://www.transcribe-bentham.da.ulcc.ac.uk/td/Transcribe_Bentham&lt;/ref&gt; Once registered, they are given transcriber privileges. The volunteer then selects a manuscript, and is presented with a manuscript image alongside a free-text box, into which he or she enters their transcript (which can be saved at any time). Volunteers are also asked to add some basic formatting to their transcripts, and encode their work in [[Text Encoding Initiative|Text-Encoding Initiative]]-compliant XML using a specially designed transcription toolbar. Using this, the volunteer can highlight a piece of text, or a position in the text, and click a button on the toolbar to identify a particular characteristic of that chosen portion. These include line breaks, paragraphs, unusual spellings, and frequent additions, deletions and marginalia present in the manuscripts.

When a volunteer is happy with his or her transcript, it is submitted to ''Transcribe Bentham'' project staff for checking. Changes are made to the text and code, if necessary, and staff decide whether or not the transcript has been completed to a satisfactory degree for uploading to the digital repository. If it is decided that no further appreciable improvements can be made, the transcript is locked for further editing and converted to an XML file. However, if staff decide that a submitted transcript is incomplete - i.e. if it is partially transcribed, or there are a number of missing or unclear words - then it will remain unlocked for further crowdsourcing.

Work is currently ongoing to make improvements and modifications to the transcription interface.

As of 18 March 2016, volunteers had transcribed or partially transcribed 15,634 manuscripts - around 7 million words - of which 94% were of the required standard to form a basis for editorial work, and to be uploaded to the digital repository.  Weekly progress updates are issued via the ''Transcribe Bentham'' blog.&lt;ref&gt;''Transcribe Bentham'' homepage and blog, http://www.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham Transcribe Bentham&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage and prizes==
The work of ''Transcribe Bentham'' has been reported upon by the international media. This coverage includes a feature article in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;P. Cohen, 'For Bentham and Others, Scholars Enlist Public to Transcribe Papers', 28 December 2010, https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/books/28transcribe.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sunday Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;R. Kinchen, 'One Stir and I'll Discover a Galaxy', 12 September 2011, http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/newsreview/features/article772703.ece&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'',&lt;ref&gt;T. Kaya, Crowdsourcing Project Hopes to Make Short Work of Transcribing Bentham, 13 September 2010, http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/crowdsourcing-project-hopes-to-make-short-work-of-transcribing-bentham/26829&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deutsche Welle|Deutsche Welle World]]&lt;ref&gt;R.

In September 2011, ''Transcribe Bentham'' was honoured with an Award of Distinction in the Digital Communities category of the [[Prix Ars Electronica]], the world's foremost digital arts competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.aec.at/#42434&lt;/ref&gt; In its report, the Digital Communities jury noted that the ''Transcribe Bentham'' transcription interface has 'the potential to become a standard tool for scholarly crowdsourcing projects', and that ''Transcribe Bentham'' as a whole has the 'potential to create the legacy of participatory education and the preservation of heritage or an endangered culture'.&lt;ref&gt;B. Achaleke, G. Harwood, A. Koblin, L. Yan, and T. Peixoto, 'Guinea pigs and apples: statement of the Digital Communities Jury', in H. Leopoldseder, C. Schöpf, and G. Stocker, ''Prix Ars Electronica International Compendium: CyberArts 2011'', Ostfildern: Hatje Cantz, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Transcribe Bentham'' was also nominated for the 2011 Digital Heritage Award,&lt;ref&gt;http://rose-holley.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/digital-cultural-heritage-awards-for.html&lt;/ref&gt; along with:

* the [[National Library of Finland]]'s [[DigitalKoot]]
* [[Old Weather]]
* the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]'s Remember Me
* the [[National Library of Australia]]'s [[NLA Trove|Trove]]

In November 2012, ''Transcribe Bentham'' came second in the Knetworks 'Platforms for Networked Innovation Competition',&lt;ref&gt;http://knetworks.eu/competition-winners&lt;/ref&gt; which sought to identify the 'most innovative web-based platform enabling regional innovation for public, private or research organizations'.&lt;ref&gt;http://knetworks.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Transcribe Bentham'' was featured on BBC Radio 4's ''PM ''programme&lt;ref&gt;Radio 4 ''PM'' report, 27 August 2013, https://audioboo.fm/boos/1570749-how-a-recipe-intended-for-inmates-of-bentham-s-proposed-panopticon-prison-is-making-its-way-onto-a-modern-restaurant-menu&lt;/ref&gt; and the BBC News website&lt;ref&gt;BBC News video report, 27 August 2013, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23794247.&lt;/ref&gt; on 27 August 2013. The report discussed how volunteers transcribed a series of recipes which were collated for Bentham's proposed panopticon prison, and how one - a 'Devonshire Pie' consisting of potatoes, tripe, onions, spleen, lungs, and gooseberries - was made by the Michelin-starred St John Smithfield restaurant.

==Open-source code==

The code for ''Transcribe Bentham's'' MediaWiki-based transcription interface is available for reuse and customisation, on an open source basis.&lt;ref&gt;https://code.google.com/p/tb-transcription-desk/&lt;/ref&gt; It has been implemented by the [[Public Record Office Victoria]] for their pilot transcription project.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.prov.vic.gov.au/index.php/Category:PROV_Transcription_Pilot_Project&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speakers ==
There are over 4000 speakers of Tsum, known as ''Tsumpas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-linguistic Survey of the Tibeto-Burman Dialects of North Gorkha District|last=Webster|first=Jeff|publisher=ms, SIL|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many speakers of the language have migrated away from the Tsum valley, and now live in [[Kathmandu]] and abroad. Younger Tsumpas are more likely to be educated in Nepali and English, leading to attrition of the language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Language structure ==
Tsum has a [[Tone (linguistics)|two-tone]] language system.

== Relationship to other languages ==
There is a varying degree of mutual intelligibility between Tsum and other [[Kyirong–Kagate language|Kyirong-Yolmo]] varieties. It is most closely related to Nubri and Gyalsumdo, and more distantly related to other languages in the family.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|date=2013|title=Report on the relationship between Yolmo and Kagate|url=|journal=Himalayan Linguistics|volume=12|pages=1-27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2508">'''Vaman Malhar Joshi''' (January 21, 1882 – July 20, 1943) was a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] writer from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

Vaman Malhar Joshi should not be confused with the playwright Waman Gopal (Veer Wamanrao) Joshi. They were contemporaries.

Joshi was born on January 21, 1882 in the town of Tale in the [[Konkan]] region of Maharashtra. After finishing his high school education in 1900, he studied at [[Deccan College Post-Graduate &amp; Research Institute|Deccan College]] in [[Pune]] to receive his bachelor's and master's degrees in 1904 and 1906, respectively.

Joshi served thereafter for a few years as a teacher in a nationalistic high school. (India was under [[British Raj]] in those times.) Since 1908, he also served  as the editor of a nationalistic monthly ''Wishwa Wrutta'' (विश्ववृत्त). Soon after 1908, British authorities imposed a three-year imprisonment with hard labor on him for the “crime" of publishing in ''Wishwa Wrutta'' some "inflammatory" articles suggesting overthrow of the British rule.

After release from the prison, Joshi worked for two years as the editor of [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Lokamanya Tilak]]'s daily ''[[Kesari (newspaper)|Kesari]]'' (केसरी). In 1918, he joined the teaching staff of the [[SNDT Women's University|Women's University]] which [[Bharat Ratna]] [[Dhondo Keshav Karve]] had founded two years earlier, (first as a women's college). He taught philosophy, psychology, and English and Marathi literature at the university. Later he became the principal of the university.

Joshi presided over [[Marathi Sahitya Sammelan]] held at [[Margao]], [[Goa]] in 1930.

{{History of Iceland}}
[[File:SC180293t.jpg|thumb|210px|[[United States Army|US Army]] training in Iceland in June 1943]]

'''Ástandið''' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: "the condition" or "the situation") is a term used about the influence [[British Army|British]] and [[United States Army|American soldiers]] had on [[Icelanders|Icelandic women]] during [[World War II]]. At its peak the population of foreign soldiers was equal to that of Icelandic men. Many of the foreign soldiers would court Icelandic women and estimates of the number of [[War bride|local women who married foreign soldiers]] goes into the hundreds. Such interaction between Icelandic women and foreign troops was not always well received and the women involved were often accused of [[Prostitution in Iceland|prostitution]] and [[treason|betraying their home country]]. [[War babies|Children born from such unions]] are known in Icelandic as ''ástandsbörn'' ("children of the condition/situation").

When the [[Invasion of Iceland|British Army invaded Iceland]] in 1940 people gathered on the streets to see the troops and the fact that many young Icelandic girls were captivated by them did not go unnoticed. Immediately discussions began over what effect this would have and minimal interaction with the troops was encouraged, but this proved to be difficult as many Icelanders had jobs in some way connected to the troops. A committee was formed which produced a damning report on the soldiers, which shed light on widespread prostitution amongst the troops. Some sources suggested that girls as young as twelve years old were involved in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anna MelsteП &amp; JСn Karl Helgason |url=http://servefir.ruv.is/her/astand.htm |title=Dansleikur М klЗbbi herlЖgreglunnar |publisher=Servefir.ruv.is |date= |accessdate=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Icelandic authorities tried unsuccessfully to reduce the soldiers' encounters with Icelandic girls but with time the issue lapsed and was no longer part of the current affairs. The soldiers went home with the conclusion of the war in 1945.

US troops returned to Iceland in 1951 as part of the [[Iceland Defense Force]] during the [[Cold War]]. In order to reassure Icelandic authorities, the troops were quarantined in the [[Keflavík Air Base]], which remained in operation until 2006.
