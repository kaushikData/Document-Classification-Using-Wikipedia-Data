__NOTOC__
Year '''479 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Vibulanus and Rutilus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 275 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 479 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] commander [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], now based in [[Thessaly]], wins support from [[Amfilochiko Argos|Argus]] and western [[Arcadia]]. He tries to win over [[Athens]] but fails.
* Mardonius attacks Athens once more and the Athenians are forced to retreat, whereupon he razes the city. The [[History of Sparta|Spartans]] march north to support Athens against the Persians.
* [[August 27]]
** The [[Battle of Plataea]] in [[Boeotia]] ends the Persian invasions of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] as the Persian general Mardonius is routed by the Greeks under [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]], nephew of the former Spartan King, [[Leonidas I]]. The Athenian contingent is led by the repatriated [[Aristides]]. Mardonius is killed in the battle and the Greeks capture enormous amounts of loot. [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] is captured shortly thereafter and the Theban collaborators executed by Pausanias.
** Meanwhile at sea, the Persians are defeated by a Greek fleet headed by [[Leotychidas]] of Sparta and [[Xanthippus]] of Athens in the [[Battle of Mycale]], off the coast of [[Lydia]] in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].
* [[Potidaea]] is struck by a [[tsunami]].&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
* In 479 BC, when Persian soldiers besieged the Greek city of Potidaea, the tide retreated much farther than usual, leaving a convenient invasion route. But this wasn't a stroke of luck. Before they had crossed halfway, the water returned in a wave higher than anyone had ever seen, drowning the attackers. The Potiidaeans believed they had been saved by the wrath of Poseidon. But what really saved them was likely the same phenomenon that has destroyed countless others: a tsunami.

==== Rome ====
* The Roman consul [[Caeso Fabius Vibulanus (consul)|Caeso Fabius]] proposed an [[agrarian law]] to distribute land won in recent wars amongst the plebs, but this was rejected by the senate.
* Ongoing [[Roman-Aequian_wars#Ongoing_hostilities_from_485_BC|hostilities]] between Rome and the [[Aequi]].  No major battle is fought.  
* Ongoing [[Roman–Etruscan_Wars#The_Fabian_war_with_Veii_in_483-476_BC|hostilities]] between Rome and [[Veii]]. The family of the [[Fabii]] requests and is granted sole responsibility for the war, and the Fabii march from Rome, establishing a fortified camp at the [[Cremera]].

== Births ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41278">[[File:spitfire mk11 pl965 arp.jpg|thumb|right|This [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire PR Mk XI]] (PL965) was a purpose-built long-range, high-altitude reconnaissance variant that was capable of flying from airfields in England and photographing as far afield as Berlin]]

A transformational growth in '''air reconnaissance''' occurred in the years 1939-45, especially in Britain and then in the United States. It was an expansion determined mostly by trial and error, represented mostly by new tactics, new procedures, and new technology, though rarely by specialized aircraft types. The mission type branched out into many sub-types, including new electronic forms of reconnaissance. In sharp contrast with the case during the pre-war years, by 1945 air reconnaissance was widely recognized as a vital, indispensable component of air power.

==Pre-war situation==
In the interwar years, reconnaissance languished as a mission type and tended to be overshadowed by routine aerial mapping. This was despite the growth (in the United States and Britain) of a doctrine of strategic bombardment as the decisive weapon of war. Experience would soon prove that bombing was completely ineffective unless accompanied by intensive aerial reconnaissance.
In the 1930s, gradual technical progress in the leading air nations led to advances particularly in [[photogrammetry]] and [[cartography]], but failed to be translated into a capable operational reconnaissance capability. The various parties went into the new war with mostly the same cameras and procedures they had used when exiting the last one. [[Stereoscopy|Stereoscopic]] imaging using overlapping exposures was refined and standardized for mapping.&lt;ref&gt;Babington Smith, 78; Stanley, 268 et passim&lt;/ref&gt; Color photography from the air was introduced in 1935 in the United States, but did not find widespread application.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, 240&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments with [[flash bomb]] photography at night were carried out pre-war, but did not lead to an operational capability until later in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, 127-131 e.a.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, apart from the case of small army-cooperation observation planes, the emphasis was almost completely on aerial mapping conducted by long-range bombers. In Germany, the Army Chief, [[Werner von Fritsch|Werner Freiherr von Fritsch]], noted that in the next war, whoever had the best air reconnaissance would win – and thereby won himself a perfunctory mention in almost all subsequent works on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Babington Smith, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in all countries, initial doctrines were focused on battlefield observation, which assumed a relatively static front, as it had been in the previous war.&lt;ref&gt;Kreis, 81, e.a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic reconnaissance in its embryonic form began with the flights carried out over Germany by Australian businessman [[Sidney Cotton]] just before the outbreak of war in Europe. On behalf of first French and then British intelligence, Cotton outfitted civilian [[Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior|Lockheed Electras]] with hidden cameras and was able to snap useful footage during business trips. Cotton pioneered (for the British) the [[trimetrogon]] mount and the important innovation of heated cameras, fogging being the bane of high-altitude photography.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, 14-38&lt;/ref&gt; However, a multi-lens trimetrogon had been used in the 1919 U.S. Bagley mapping camera, and Germany had heated optics during the Great War.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Western reconnaissance==
Sidney Cotton’s work found only grudging approval with the Royal Air Force, but eventually his work was incorporated into [[No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF|No. 1 Photographic Development Unit]] (PDU) at [[Heston Aerodrome|RAF Heston]] and then [[RAF Benson]], a unit from which most later British air reconnaissance developed. (It soon was renamed 1 PRU, R for reconnaissance.)&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, 18&lt;/ref&gt; Key to the RAF’s intellectual ascendancy in reconnaissance was the establishment of the Central Interpretation Unit (CIU) at [[RAF Medmenham]]. Priority tasks of this unit were to prepare target folders and to chart Axis air defenses. In short order, it began to evaluate the effectiveness of bombing.&lt;ref&gt;Ehlers&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Photo interpretation]].

At first Britain used a handful of hastily modified [[Spitfire]]s (PR 1) and some medium twins ([[Bristol Blenheim]]s) for photographic reconnaissance, supplemented by in-action footage shot from regular bombing aircraft. At this time the RAF still used the vintage F8 and [[F24 camera]]s, later adding the larger F52. The F24 became especially useful in night photography.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Staerck&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to bomb damage assessment (BDA) the complete failure of precision daylight bombing soon became apparent, the vast majority of bombers not even coming close to their targets. This resulted in heavier demands on reconnaissance for before-and-after photography; and the documented poor results (as well as heavy losses) led to a shift to night-time area bombing.&lt;ref&gt;Ehlers&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain was far behind Germany in [[optics]], and at one time 1 PRU took two [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] Ikon cameras with 60&amp;nbsp;cm lenses from a lost [[Ju 88]] and used them for high-altitude photography.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1941, the RAF had a capable reconnaissance arm (1 PRU) centered at RAF Benson, supported by a nascent infrastructure in interpretation and analysis. The Combined/Joint Intelligence Committee (CIC) ensured centralized tasking for critical objectives. The RAF led this field by far, and in 1941 several American observers from both the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] (USAAC) and the [[U.S. Navy]] were sent to England to investigate RAF reconnaissance methods.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard. See also Arnold, Henry: Global Mission. General Arnold was one of the fact-finders in Britain in spring 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the case in the previous war, French reconnaissance was now comparatively ineffective on all levels, and entirely lacked a strategic perspective. Most aircraft allocated to the mission type were obsolete. Large numbers of open-cockpit [[ANF Les Mureaux 113|Mureaux 115/117]] and light twin [[Potez 630]] series were assigned to Army cooperation according to observation doctrines from the previous war. However, the new and scarce [[Bloch 174]] twin distinguished itself by its high performance. Noted writer and reconnaissance pilot [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]] flew this aircraft before the fall of France.&lt;ref&gt;St. Exupery: Flight to Arras, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

==German reconnaissance capabilities==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-363-2258-11, Flugzeug Junkers Ju 88.jpg|thumb|Ju 88A over France, 1942]]
Despite a considerable technological and numerical head start, Germany gradually neglected [[aerial reconnaissance]], at least relative to Britain. The reason, grounded in history and geography, was that Germany had no strategic bombing doctrine and viewed air power as an auxiliary of land armies. Numerous Aufklärungs (up-clearing, i.e. reconnaissance) units were established for marine and ground support purposes, but while this was effective in the tactical sense, the intellectual investment in interpretation, analysis, and strategic estimation lagged. From the German perspective, this was defensible considering that about 90% of the action lay in large land-battles in the East, and an expensive long-range air capability would have been unlikely to effectively change the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Hooton&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading up to the war, the United States developed an indigenous high-quality optics capability led by [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]] of Rochester, N.Y.; however this company had been allied to Germany’s Zeiss-Jena. Nonetheless, the American reconnaissance expert, then-captain [[George William Goddard]], said that he much coveted German technical leadership, specifically as represented by [[Carl Zeiss]] [[Jena]] optical works, and he was pleased to briefly occupy that facility at the end of the war. But the [[Luftwaffe|German Air Force]], expecting a quick victory, did not build an integrated reconnaissance and interpretation capability as a core national security asset like the Anglo Allies did.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, 340-41&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-117-01, Aufklärungsflugzeug Blohm - Voß BV 141.jpg|thumb|left|Blohm &amp; Voss BV 141]]
Before 22 June 1941, German reconnaissance was far predominant in frequency with many daily sorties throughout the region. Leading up to the invasion of France, concentration was on ports, forts, railways and airports, using mostly [[Dornier Do 17|Do 17P]]s and [[Heinkel He 111|He 111H]]s, already vulnerable types, and rapid conversion to [[Ju 88]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;D, later Ju 88H followed. Losses were on the order of 5-10%. A regular daily weather reconnaissance was kept up over the North Sea. Maritime reconnaissance from France and Norway reached well west of Ireland to the coast of Greenland using [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Focke Wulf Fw 200]] and various multi-engine seaplanes.&lt;ref&gt;Hooton,197-201&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany used the [[LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin]] airship for [[sigint]] sorties targeting RAF radar stations in 1939.

German units were divided into Fernaufklärer (long-distance), Nahaufklärer (tactical, subordinate to Army command), Nachtaufklärer (night photography), and maritime and special units. Command structure and unit designations changed incessantly. Each staffel (squadron, roughly) had a Bildgruppe of interpreters, who would telephone urgent intelligence to nearby headquarters. Film and analyses would go to Fliegerkorps (higher-level) staff later; eventually top-level staff at [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW) headquarters at [[Zossen]] near Berlin would receive the products for filing and possibly strategic integration.&lt;ref&gt;Hooton, 199; Babington Smith&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Junkers Ju 86P high altitude reconnaissance plane c1940.jpg|thumb|right|A Ju 86P high-[[altitude]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]], with Jumo 207 [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Diesel engine|diesel]] powerplants.]]
Germany emphasized tactical reconnaissance and invested considerably in both modified aircraft – primarily [[Ju 88]]s and [[Ju 188]]s – and in dedicated types such as the asymmetric [[Blohm &amp; Voss BV 141]] (20 built) and the twin-boom [[Focke-Wulf Fw 189|Fw 189 ''Uhu'']] (nearly 900 produced). This Nahaufklärung was primarily successful on the Eastern Front where immediate results were desired, and these units were directly under Army field command. For special demanding tasks a high-altitude photographic [[reconnaissance aircraft]], the [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] [[Ju 86]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;P was available in very small numbers, but it could not survive after 1943. Also pressurized, the [[Ju 388]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;L could reach 45,000 feet and much higher [[airspeed]]s than the Ju 86P but only 50 examples were built late in the war and few saw operational service. Fighters, often with dual oblique cameras in the rear fuselage, were pressed into service for reconnaissance where their speed was necessary, and performed well in this role. Overall, however German reconnaissance against well-defended England was relatively ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German attack on the USSR, the German Air Force did carry out an extensive pre-strike aerial observation of European Russia. This was possible partly because Soviet air opposition was weak, and because of the Soviet leadership’s conviction that Germany would not attack. The Luftwaffe maintained air superiority in the East until late in the war, but simply could not bring enough resources to bear for air power to be decisive.&lt;ref&gt;Hooton&lt;/ref&gt;

Axis partners, Italy and Japan, successfully performed long-distance reconnaissance prior to meeting stiffening opposition in 1942. Japanese aircraft reconnoitered the Philippines prior to 7 December 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 169-0112, Russland, erbeutetes Flugzeug Po-2 - restored.jpg|thumb|right|A damaged and abandoned Po-2 forced to land in [[Ukraine]], and subsequently captured by German troops, 1941.]]
The [[Soviet Union]] had no advanced reconnaissance resources, but emphasized visual observation and reporting over the battle space. Open-cockpit biplanes such as the [[Po-2]] were very useful for this, especially at night. The Soviets had virtually no interest in long-range air power or strategic reconnaissance, and had no advanced optics capabilities. However, they learned a lot about the discipline from the Americans when the U.S. Army Air Forces operated from three Ukrainian bases in 1944 ([[Operation Frantic]]). This operation included a photo-reconnaissance detachment which shared all results with the USSR. At the same time, Americans learned that Soviet photoreconnaissance capabilities were embryonic.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 354-387&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese reconnaissance was characterized by institutional rivalry between the Army and the Navy. The latter standardized on the [[Yokosuka D4Y|Yokosuka ''Suisei'']] (''Judy'') and [[Nakajima C6N]] (''Myrt'') multi-seat aircraft. The Army, which encountered little air opposition in China, used a variety of aircraft types and cameras.

Italy entered the war in 1940 with a very large number of obsolete observation aircraft, mostly open-cockpit biplanes assigned directly to Army commands. Initially, some strategic surveillance was carried out by three-engined bombers, and Italian aircraft ranged from Nigeria to Abyssinia to Bahrein (one flew to Japan and back). Italian reconnaissance could not survive in contested airspace.

Neutral countries seemingly remained in the World War I mindset of trench observation. While aerial photography was allocated to tactically inferior aircraft, and aerial mapping advanced considerably, there was no concept of strategic reconnaissance and little thought given to analysis and interpretation. Surprisingly, this was even the case in the United States, where the Air Corps had staked its future on the doctrine of strategic bombing. Up to 1940, the [[USAAC]]’s interest in reconnaissance was centered in one small office at [[Wright Field]], Ohio, headed by the controversial Captain [[George William Goddard]]. He was responsible for most of the technical advantages adopted by the USAAC during the early war years. The extensive O-series of aircraft, such as the [[Douglas O-38]] and its descendants, were typically low and slow and used for direct Army liaison, artillery spotting, and observation. The OA series of observation amphibians were mostly Army variants of better known Navy types, such as the [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]]. These were in practice more utility aircraft than dedicated reconnaissance platforms. In December 1941, complacency and inadequate leadership led to the failure to detect the Japanese task force north of Hawaii from the air.&lt;ref&gt;numerous investigations of Pearl Harbor reached this conclusion, which is still preferred to alternative theories.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Americans labored under the handicap that much equipment was assigned to Britain as fast as it could be produced.

==American contribution==
By 1941, prompted by the British experience, Americans began to understand the need for a much expanded air reconnaissance concept. The F-series, which denoted photographic reconnaissance, was then led by the F-3A, a modified [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20 Havoc]]. Thanks in large part to the advocacy of the Director of Photographic Intelligence, the also very controversial Colonel Minton Kaye, a run of 100 [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|Lockheed P-38]]s were set aside for modification to F-4 standard, incorporating the trigonometric mount that both Kaye and Cotton had pioneered prior to the war. Despite the promising performance of the F-4, there were so many technical problems with the early versions that the model was largely rejected by its crews when it did reach combat zones. The RAF rejected the P-38, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, 297, 299&lt;/ref&gt;

The first U.S. operational reconnaissance experience was gained in the Australian theater. The top name to emerge was that of Colonel [[Karl Polifka]], an extremely aggressive pilot who developed many of the tactics that would later become standard. Operating from [[Port Moresby]] to [[Rabaul]], his F-4-equipped 8th PR squadron encountered serious problems reducing it at one time to one aircraft, but the valuable experience gained was shared by Polifka when he returned to the U.S. in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 275-7&lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States and Britain invaded French North Africa in November 1942, the hastily improvised reconnaissance capability was quickly checked by reality. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s son, Colonel [[Elliott Roosevelt]], led the American reconnaissance assets and in February joined with RAF units in the multinational [[Northwest African Photographic Reconnaissance Wing]] (NAPRW). At that point the Wing had found the F-4 unsatisfactory, the F-9 or [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Fortress]] unable to survive over enemy territory, and the new British [[de Havilland Mosquito]] to be the most promising reconnaissance platform. British squadrons in the Mediterranean took over the slack left by the Americans. Numerous other technical and tactical problems virtually brought American reconnaissance to a halt; but it rebounded swiftly, and by the time of the invasion of Sicily in July ([[Operation Husky]]), a very credible joint capability existed, the NAPRW comprising South African, Free French, and New Zealand units as well as RAF and USAAC units. By that time, new [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning#Variants|F-5]] models of the Lightning were becoming available, and they were found to be far more reliable and capable. However, this period marked the beginning of a year-long struggle by the [[USAAF]], led especially by Colonel Roosevelt, to acquire the Mosquito and to also develop a brand new reconnaissance aircraft – a quest that would result in the ill-fated and scandal-ridden [[Hughes XF-11]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen&lt;/ref&gt;

The RAF continued to display leadership in the field, and now took on the role of on-the-job mentor to the Americans. [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] and Mosquitos were found to be the best reconnaissance platforms, as everyone now realized that speed, range, and altitude were essential to survival and good photographs. Second-line photographic aircraft (such as [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Bostons]], Blenheims, [[Martin Maryland|Marylands]]) were relegated to less contested skies. The RAF turned Medmenham into the Allied Central Interpretation Unit (ACIU), inviting the Americans to participate on a joint basis, and continued to spin off new squadrons with high-performance reconnaissance aircraft based both in the British Isles and in the Mediterranean. Other RAF units operated in the Far East, often with slightly less capable aircraft such as [[Hawker Hurricane]]s and [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]]s.

A very large fraction of RAF reconnaissance was consumed in tracking German capital ships. This endeavor even included stationing photo detachments at [[Vaenga air field]] on the [[Kola Peninsula]]. When the British returned home, their reconnaissance aircraft were given to the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period Wing Commander [[Adrian Warburton]] built a reputation as a daring and productive reconnaissance pilot; and Wing Commander D. W. Steventon undertook many important missions, inc. some of the first overflights of the German experimental site of [[Peenemünde Army Research Center|Peenemunde]] on the Baltic coast.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, 99-103&lt;/ref&gt; The interpreters at ACIU gained recognition for their expertise, F/O [[Constance Babington Smith]], MBE and [[Sarah Churchill (actress)|Sarah (Churchill) Oliver]] being among the noted names.&lt;ref&gt;Babington Smith&lt;/ref&gt; A scientific approach to reconnaissance developed, topped by the involvement of the Prime Minister when particularly notable results were discussed, such as the discovery of German jet fighters in test. The RAF also early developed the standard three-phase interpretation procedure: first phase required immediate response (such as advancing columns of armor sighted); second phase required 24- hour handling (such as concentrations of landing crafts in ports); and third phase was for long-term analysis (such as industrial targets like coal gasification plants). Also, the distinction between strategic and tactical reconnaissance became clear, and sub-specialties like weather reconnaissance, radar photography, and bomb-damage assessment (BDA) became current. Both sides developed programs of regular weather reconnaissance in the Atlantic. In addition, the technique widely known as “dicing” – extreme low-altitude photography at high speed – came to be adopted by the Allies for special work.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 280-281&lt;/ref&gt;
Colonel Roosevelt pioneered night photography over Sicily. Flash bombs had to set off at very precise timing in order to capture the image, and in time the [[Harold Edgerton|Edgerton D-2]] Flash System came into wide use, this involving [[capacitor]] discharge at precise intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, 329-330&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[infrared]] film began to be used at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, 236&lt;/ref&gt; It was generally agreed that the Mosquito, designated F-8 by the Americans, was the best platform – apart from its performance, it offered the use of another operator in the glazed nose, which made both navigation and the very delicate selection of camera controls to match speed and altitude easier than in the single-seat F-5 Lightnings. Nonetheless, the Americans began to standardize on F-5s and [[F-6 Mustang]]s in order to promote an indigenous capability and break away from the RAF’s tutelage.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, Kreis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endgame==
[[File:325coverphoto.jpg|thumb|325th Reconnaissance Wing yearbook cover, published in 1945.]]
By [[D-day]], the U.S. 8th and [[9th Air Force]]s had an immense reconnaissance wing in Colonel Roosevelt’s [[325th Reconnaissance Wing]]. It commanded two groups, the [[25th Bombardment Group]] at [[RAF Watton]] and the 7th PRG at [[RAF Mount Farm]] (other units supported tactical reconnaissance for the 9th Air Force). The seven squadrons of the 325th provided routine weather recon, pathfinder-services, BDA, [[chaff]] and other electronic services, radar photography and night missions, as well as special operations in support of inserted agents. In Italy, the [[Mediterranean Allied Photographic Reconnaissance Wing]] under Colonel Polifka provided similar services, and using staging bases in the Ukraine these units together could provide full, regular coverage of the shrinking Axis territory.

The RAF maintained a similar large number of reconnaissance squadrons, dominated by Spitfires and Mosquitos; however, in the Far East and the Middle East, less capable types tended to be allocated to reconnaissance and army cooperation. For example, in [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|Iraq during the 1941 Nazi coup]], the RAF relied on [[Hawker Audax]] biplanes. What had begun with one PRU in 1940 eventually amounted to several dozen squadrons worldwide.

Because of a singular devotion to victory through strategic bombing, the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] placed extraordinary emphasis on reconnaissance. As an example, the need to destroy German petroleum, oil and lubricants facilities required careful monitoring to decide not only what to hit, but when and how much – and then when to hit them again. This led to an emphasis on long-term surveillance, and also to centralized analysis correlating photography with other sources (such as agents on the ground). Although the RAF usually preferred area bombing, it promoted a similar reconnaissance emphasis, for example in the celebrated discovery, coverage, and analysis of the [[Peenemünde Army Research Center|Peenemunde rocket range]] which culminated in an important August 1943 raid. The Axis had no comparable strategic capability and most Axis air resources were consumed in support of massive ground battles.

In general, Western reconnaissance aircraft were unarmed, not only to maximize performance, but to emphasize the objective of bringing back pictures, not engaging the enemy. They also usually flew singly or in widely spread pairs. In special circumstances it was necessary to bring along fighter escorts; this phenomenon arose again in the last months when the hitherto sovereign Mosquito began to be picked off by [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] [[Jet aircraft|jet]]s. Selected heavy bombers carried film cameras and cameramen. The [[8th Air Force]]’s 8th Combat Camera Unit thus documented much of the air war, and these films are much more frequently shown today than are the static images of regular reconnaissance.

D-Day constituted the single biggest photo-recon job in history. One who was there reported that at the ACIU, 1,700 officers and enlistees studied 85,000 images daily. There were 12,000 Allied aircraft in the air over the region that day.&lt;ref&gt;Brugioni, 23-26&lt;/ref&gt; If the invasion was counted as a major reconnaissance success, the Ardennes offensive (known in America as the [[Battle of the Bulge]]) in December was a major failure. Post-battle investigation maintained that the problem lay not in obtaining airborne evidence, but in integrating the numerous disparate data points into a coherent picture. Also, by then the Germans had learned to move by night and under cover of seasonal bad weather when possible. These countermeasures, also including going underground and exploiting snow cover, came to represent some of the limitations of overhead reconnaissance even in conditions of overwhelming air superiority.&lt;ref&gt;Babington Smith, 255-257&lt;/ref&gt;

German reconnaissance languished in the west because radar-aided air defenses there made survival unlikely. Apart from the ubiquitous Ju 88s, the [[Heinkel He 177]]s proved valuable as a reconnaissance platform but that type was extremely troubled mechanically. In effect, the Luftwaffe was unable to carry out regular surveillance of critical targets like the British Isles prior to the invasion of June 1944; indeed, one German aircraft was “allowed” to overfly [[Dover]] in order to report on a fake invasion build-up there.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, 331&lt;/ref&gt; (However, Brugioni maintains that Germany did conduct sufficient flights to estimate the time and place of the invasion.)&lt;ref&gt;Brugioni&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, a few jets became available:  [[Arado Ar 234]] allocated to Sonderkommandos, but although they were uninterceptable the results brought back seems to have added little value to the German war effort. A version of the very advanced [[Dornier Do 335]] was assigned to recon duties. Reconnaissance was more successful in the East, and the Germans did carry out large-scale photographic mapping, some of which would later benefit the western Allies. The Luftwaffe also successfully deployed night photography with flash bombs, as amply documented by the BDA of the annihilating German attack on the USAAF in the Ukrainian SSR in June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 372-375&lt;/ref&gt;

At sea, Germany had a considerable early lead in long-range aircraft, chiefly represented by the Fw 200 ''Condor''. This was a converted airliner unsuitable for the rigors of combat. As a Fernaufklärer, the large [[Junkers Ju 290|Ju 290]] had the necessary range, but it was produced in low numbers and was very vulnerable. Seeaufklärer and Kustenflieger groups used seaplanes of many different types with considerable success in coastal areas, especially from Norway. By 1942-43 the Condor menace was subsiding, and German long-range aircraft had great difficulty surviving in the Atlantic. They were much more effective in Northern Norway against the Arctic convoys. Germany adopted armed reconnaissance as an expediency at these long ranges.&lt;ref&gt;Hooton&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the industrial centers arrayed against the [[Axis powers|Axis]] – in the United States and the Urals and Siberia – were simply out of reach of strategic reconnaissance. As always it was at the tactical level that the Germans excelled, and short-range aircraft were able to hold their own in the East until fuel, pilots, and even aircraft became depleted. Experts generally hold that the top German leadership failed to understand air power, and [[Hitler]] has been especially blamed for lacking the strategic perspective that the West Allies adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Hooton&lt;/ref&gt; But since the industrial mismatch was insurmountable, it is doubtful what difference a greater German emphasis on strategic reconnaissance and commensurate bombardment would have made.

The Allies were slow to allocate very long ranged aircraft to maritime duties. They needed long-range maritime surveillance to hunt [[submarines]] just as the Luftwaffe needed it to hunt convoys. Stung by catastrophic losses, in April 1943 the United States finally allocated sufficient numbers of VLR (very long range) aircraft to suppress submarines. This was an important factor in defeating the U-boat offensive that spring. Maritime versions of the [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24]] served effectively in this maritime patrol role.&lt;ref&gt;The USAAF in World War II (official history)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union had virtually no in-depth reconnaissance capability and relied overwhelmingly on human intelligence ([[humint]]). By the time of the brief U.S.-Soviet shuttle bombing program in the summer of 1944, the Americans noted that Soviet reconnaissance did not venture far past the front, and that photographic technology was far inferior. At [[Poltava]], the U.S. reconnaissance detachment shared all imagery as well as tactics and technology with their Soviet counterparts, enabling the latter to comprehend American operations and develop an indigenous capability. Besides, for strategic intelligence the Soviets had thoroughly infiltrated both Allied and Axis governments at the most sensitive levels.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 366-370; Stanley, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pacific, long range was at a premium, and both fleet and army aircraft soon reflected an overwhelming American advantage. The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], prompted by the intelligence failure at [[Pearl Harbor]], invested in long-range patrol aircraft like the ubiquitous PBY Catalina. However, from early on the Allies had a tremendous unseen advantage in signals intelligence and [[cryptography]], being able to read Axis codes. This led to economies in reconnaissance.

Perhaps surprising considering her small industrial base, Japan may have built the finest and most beautiful reconnaissance aircraft of the war. These included several superb platforms such as “the Japanese Mosquito”, the unarmed [[Mitsubishi Ki-46]] "Dinah"; and the extreme-long-range [[Kawanishi H8K]] "Emily", widely considered the best flying boat of the war. These aircraft reached as far as Ceylon. The Navy’s standard [[Nakajima C6N]] "Myrt" was also an extremely capable reconnaissance platform from 1944 on. But it does not appear that Japan had the overall industrial capability nor made the intellectual investment necessary to run a competitive reconnaissance branch. From 1943, the Japanese were virtually always on the defensive, while new long-range, high-altitude U.S. aircraft climaxing with the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] (F-13 in the reconnaissance role) provided overwhelming American coverage of the Home Islands from mid-1944.

==Cameras==
Aircraft usually carried several different camera configurations in one bay. A common installation was the trimetrogon: one vertical, and one oblique to each side. Often one aircraft carried several different camera-lens configurations for special purposes. The British found that a rearwards-facing camera could overcome some of the jitter from sideways movement, and that very low-level photography (called dicing) benefitted from an almost side-ways camera view. Most surveillance was conducted from extremely high altitudes, requiring long-focus optics, as reflected in “Goddard’s Law”: In photo-reconnaissance there is no substitute for focal length.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard; Stanley&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the primary aerial cameras were the K-series and naval F-series produced by Fairchild. Inventor [[Sherman Fairchild]] had developed the K-3 in 1919 based on experience from the Great War. His work would dominate the field for decades, including in the form of foreign copies. Initially many cameras still used German [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] and [[Schneider Kreuznach|Schneider]] optics. The U.S. K-17 (9x9 inch image) with several different lenses was especially ubiquitous. For mapping, a six-inch lens was standard. The less common K-18 (9x18) was used for high altitude. K-19s were used at night, and the small K-20s (4x5) for low-level obliques. Although standardized on 9X9 inch plates, several similar camera types came into use. The period saw a rapid development of longer focal lengths in order to enable high-resolution high-altitude photography. 12, 24, 36 and ultimately 60-inch lenses came into use. The Americans also produced and used British cameras (F24 as K24). The old James Bagley T-1 mapping camera and its multi-lens descendants were still used strictly for aerial mapping. The Navy used variants of the Fairchild series.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the small F24 (5x5 image) and the derivative but much larger F52 (8.5x7) aerial cameras dominated, the former being used mostly for night photography with the aid of flash bombs. Up to 40-inch lenses were fitted. These cameras had shutter-in-focal-plane, whereas U.S. cameras standardized on shutter-between-lenses, claiming this reduced distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Staerck, 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposures typically required the use of a cockpit-mounted intervalometer, set by reference to speed, altitude, and interval so that the pilot or observer could obtain the correct exposures by keying a switch. Great flight precision was needed especially for exposures for stereography and cartography in general.

While German optics were superior, experts noted that standard German reconnaissance cameras, though excellent, were heavy and not optimized for aerial use. [[Leica Camera|Leica]] seemed to be the main camera manufacturer while optics production was concentrated at ISCO [[Göttingen]] (Schneider) and Zeiss. The bulky Rb30 (Reihenbild) and its variants were in common use. This required at least two men for handling and produced 12x12 (32&amp;nbsp;cm) images. It was supplemented by smaller hand-held cameras, Hk13 (Handkamera) and Hk19, which also could be fitted into the rear fuselage of single-engine fighters. In general, the focal length in cm was indicated by the first number and the plate size by the second, thus Rb50/30. As an example, the Do 17P carried Rb 20/30 + Rb 50/30 or Rb 20/18 + Rb 50/18 cameras as well as defensive guns. The cameras were controlled remotely by the crew from the cockpit. Other configurations arose as needed.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, 172-176 e.a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese cameras were a mixture of domestic and imported/copied types. The Navy often used copies of the American Fairchild K-8 and K-20, and also a copy of the U.S. Navy’s F-8. The Army used small, usually handheld Type 96, 99 (K-20), and 100. [[Konica]] and [[Nikon]] were the main manufactures. Some German cameras were also used. As Japanese reconnaissance aircraft were multi-seat, the rear observer usually operated the cameras. Japan trained only a relative handful of officers as photo interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Because of their initial disregard for reconnaissance, all belligerents shared in the failure to develop and field a dedicated, survivable air reconnaissance platform, although they belatedly recognized the need therefore. As a result, nearly all recon aircraft were converted combat aircraft, and the proposed dedicated U.S. types (F-11 and F-12) were canceled after the peace. Soon after the war, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] did develop such a dedicated aircraft, the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]]. From 1945 aerial reconnaissance became a critical, high-priority component of national security in both the U.S. and Britain.

The results obtained from reconnaissance were controversial. Bomb Damage Assessment (BDA) generally revealed less damage than bombers estimated, and even the BDA was found to be inflated after ground truth could be established. The tendency to overestimate both threat and damage was endemic to the field.&lt;ref&gt;Ehlers&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions arose over why German reconnaissance had been ineffective. Babington Smith noted that the [[Zossen]] image library was soon discovered in a barn in [[Bad Reichenhall]] near [[Berchtesgaden]], and that the square-foot sized photographs were impressive. But interrogations revealed that the interpreters were poorly trained, didn’t use stereoscopes, and “it was a horrible warning as to what photographic intelligence can become if it is based on the wrong concepts, and staffed almost entirely by uninspired plodders.”&lt;ref&gt;Bab. Smith, 257-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of the Axis to measure up in reconnaissance cannot be ascribed to technical deficiency or indifference. Despite many efforts in this direction, it also cannot be wholly ascribed to top-level stupidity, since the Axis had no monopoly on this either. As in many other aspects of the war, it instead highlighted that reconnaissance must be viewed and developed holistically, as a national (or multinational) capability integrating many advanced resources, scientific, industrial, and intellectual; it also requires a centralized management tying it in with other intelligence specialties and related disciplines like targeting. In these matters, once aroused, the Anglo powers together had the required heft and persistence; the opposition simply was not nearly as strong or as mentally adjusted to a protracted global conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Ehlers&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the top objectives of Allied occupation was the center of optical excellence in [[Jena]]; Colonel Goddard said that U.S. bombers had orders to spare Jena. In June 1945 the Americans under Goddard evacuated most of the top scientific staff to the West; however, Soviet troops moved the physical plant to the USSR, enslaving the remaining high-value workers there.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, 345&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as the war ended, the USAAF in Europe used existing resources in an all-out effort to map Europe from the air before diplomatic considerations would make it difficult. Similar efforts were made elsewhere. The United States got access to a limited amount of German coverage of the European part of the Soviet Union, and soon began a costly and technically ambitious program to obtain pictures of the rest.

From 1946, the focus was no longer just on photography, but on signals intelligence and especially on new air sampling methods to detect and analyze nuclear fall-out. The extremely close operating relationship between the RAF and the USAAF (USAF from 1947) would survive the war, and the tactics, technology, terminology and in general the shared intellectual infrastructure in aerial surveillance and analysis would transition into the Cold War, becoming embodied in the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] by 1960. By then, no other country, including the Soviet Union, had national technical means for reconnaissance remotely rivaling those the RAF-USAF founded during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Brugioni&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

During its inaugural year, AnimeCon went deeply into debt due to severe budget overruns. Soon after, a management dispute erupted which imperiled the chance of a follow-on. Many of the staff went on to form Anime Expo, while others went on to form a rival convention, [[Anime America]] (which was canceled in 1997 and went defunct shortly thereafter). The period between late 1992 and early 1997 is sometimes referred to as the "Con Wars" by attendees and staffers of both conventions. It was typified by a number of personal attacks and allegations of sabotage on and off the Internet (and in particular on rec.arts.anime).

Although Anime Expo is, for all practical purposes, considered separate from AnimeCon, the [[Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation]] (AX's parent organization) took control of AnimeCorp in 1992 and assumed many of its legal and financial obligations (including all debts incurred), the rights to the AnimeCon name, and existing stocks of unsold merchandise (including large numbers of the aforementioned T-shirts). Pre-registrations for the planned AnimeCon '92 were converted into Anime Expo '92 pre-registrations.&lt;ref name="registrations"&gt;{{cite newsgroup

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, AnimeCon merchandise is considered a collectible item by some. Program booklets and T-shirts can still be found. AnimeCon T-shirts were sold on behalf of the SPJA during the subsequent years of AX.

The '''Argentine Military Cemetery''', {{lang-es|Cementerio de Darwin}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_en___AR356&amp;q=site%3A.gov.ar+%22cementerio+de+darwin%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq= gov.ar cementerio de darwin]&lt;/ref&gt; (Darwin Cemetery), is a [[military cemetery]] on [[East Falkland]] that holds the remains of 237 [[Falklands War#Casualties|Argentine combatants]] killed during the 1982 [[Falklands War]] ({{lang-es|Guerra de las Malvinas}}). It is located west of the Darwin Settlement close to the location of the [[Battle of Goose Green]] and there is a replica of the cemetery at [[Berazategui]] in [[Buenos Aires Province]] Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berazategui.gov.ar/verhistorial.php?idGacetilla=52 ''La réplica del cementerio de Darwin, ubicado en el cementerio de Berazategui, un muro en el que están plasmados los nombres de los siete soldados berazateguenses que fallecieron'']{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cementerio de Puerto Darwin, Islas Malvinas.jpg|thumb|right|The Cemetery in 2008]]
When the war ended on June 14, 1982, most Argentine bodies were left in temporary graves close to where they fell. Britain offered to send them to Buenos Aires, but the ruling military junta said they were already in their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=1982 Falklands |episodelink= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007t0w9 |accessdate=20 October 2011 |series=20th Century Battlefields |serieslink=|credits=Peter Snow, Dan Snow |network=BBC |station= |city= |airdate=16 July 2008 |language=English |quote=After the war the British government offered to return the bodies of the Argentinian dead to Argentina for burial, but their government refused. They said that these islands were part of Argentina, and the bodies would remain here. For the Falkland islanders, these graves are a reminder that Argentina refuses to drop its claim their homeland. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Falklands 1982: Ground Operations in the South Atlantic |author=Gregory Fremont-Barnes |page=93 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fTKkAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1982 the British government commissioned a firm of civilian [[undertaker]]s under the command of British Army Colonel Geoffrey Cardozo, to consolidate all the temporary Argentine graves on the Islands to a single location. Assisted by the armed forces, they identified and documented each Argentine grave site and brought the bodies to [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Port Darwin]]. As at the time this was the largest single Argentine grave site, with the bodies of the 47 Argentine soldiers, killed at the Battle of Goose Green and buried there soon after the battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forodecuyo.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=6748 Suplemento de Historia Argentina] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the bodies collected were without [[Dog tag (identifier)|dog-tags]], so best efforts were made to identify each soldier from personal effects found on the body.  Single items were not considered conclusive, but collections were. All were given a [[Christian burial]] with [[Military funeral|full military honours]].  Each grave is marked by a white wooden cross with the name of the soldier on it if known or ''Soldado Argentino Solo Conocido Por Dios'' ("Argentine Soldier Known Only By God") if not.

There is also a [[common grave]] on Pebble Island containing the 5 crewman of a [[Learjet 24|T-24 Learjet]], belonging to Fenix Squadron shot down by a [[Sea Dart|surface-air missile]] from [[HMS Exeter (D89)|HMS Exeter]], over Pebble Island on June 7.  This grave contains the remains of airman: Comodoro Rodolfo de la Colina, Vicecomodoro Juan Jose Ramon Falconier, Major Marcelo Lotufo, Subof Pr Francisco Tomas Luna and Subof Ay Guido Antonio Marizza.

The cemetery is protected by a walled enclosure with a cenotaph including an image of Argentina's patron saint, the [[Our Lady of Luján|Virgen del Lujan]]. Surrounding the graves, the names of the 649 Argentine soldiers, sailors and airmen who lost their lives in the conflict, are inscribed on glass plaques, with no indication of military rank or service, as requested by their families.

;Since the end of the conflict the bodies of three more Argentine pilots have been interred:
* Capitán Jorge Osvaldo García successfully ejected from his [[Argentine air forces in the Falklands War|Argentine]] [[A-4 Skyhawk#Falklands War|Skyhawk]] after being shot down by a [[Sea Dart missile|Sea Dart]] [[surface-to-air missile]] on May 25 but wasn't recovered from the water. His body was found in a dinghy on [[Golding Island]] in 1983.
* Lt. Giménez, a [[FMA IA 58 Pucará|Pucará]] pilot, whose body was found in 1986.  His burial was attended by his family, the first Argentine relatives to visit the Falklands since the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/argentine-aircraftlosses.html |title=One of their aircraft is missing |accessdate=2009-11-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107231634/http://britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/argentine-aircraftlosses.html |archivedate=7 November 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lt Jorge Casco &lt;sup&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47qmXJCqXag video]&lt;/sup&gt;, another Skyhawk pilot, who crashed in bad weather on [[South Jason Island]] and was buried on 7 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://en.mercopress.com/2009/03/10/uk-military-honours-for-argentine-remain-burial-in-falklands | title= UK military honours for Argentine Pilot| accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Lt. Casco, his family requested that his remains be buried on the Falklands even after they were returned to Argentina in July 2008 for DNA testing in order to confirm his identity.

On 9 November 2002 [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]], himself a Falklands War Veteran, visited the Argentine cemetery and laid a [[wreath]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1412629/Princes-Falklands-tribute-to-Argentine-dead.html | title= Prince's Falklands tribute to Argentine dead| accessdate=2009-11-09 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Richard | last=Savill | date=2002-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the visit the Prince said, "I lost friends and colleagues and I know what it must be like for the great many Argentines who have shared the same experience."&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt;

Since the UK-Argentine joint statement on 14 July 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/news/2002/02/uk-argentina-exchange-o-new02647|title= UK-Argentina exchange of letters | accessdate=2009-11-09}}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine families are responsible for the cemetery's upkeep and in 2007, Sebastián Socodo, an Argentine married to a Falkland Islander, was employed to do the job of cemetery maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?t=107232&amp;page=42| title= Simple service pays respect to the Argentine dead | accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6525777.stm|title=Love bridges Falklands divide|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=4 April 2007|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acts of vandalism==
 
=== 2012 vandalism ===
In July 2012 the glass casing protecting a figure of Argentina's patron saint, the Virgin of Luján, at the head of the cemetery was smashed with what appeared to be an axe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.mercopress.com/2012/08/01/argentina-will-formally-protest-vandalism-at-the-darwin-cemetery-in-falklands Argentina will formally protest vandalism at the Darwin cemetery in Falklands]&lt;/ref&gt;  Argentina presented a formal protest to the British government and informed the [[United Nations]] and the [[International Red Cross]]. Sebastián Socodo, an Argentinian-Falklander&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=4 April 2007 |title= Love bridges Falklands divide |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6525777.stm |newspaper= [[BBC News]] |location= |access-date=2016-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; responsible for the cemetery's upkeep, said families were notified and that it was not clear when it occurred or who the perpetrators were. Police in the Falklands held an investigation and the glass casing was repaired.

===2017 vandalism=== 
A further act of vandalism was found in January 2017, when the glass was broken and the head of the [[Virgin of Luján]] statue damaged.
The Argentinian Foreign Ministry made a formal complaint to the British Government condemning the vandalism and calling for an enquiry. 
A Falkland Islands Government statement described the act as "distressing for the families (of the soldiers) and regretted by the people of the Falkland Islands" and an enquiry was begun by the Royal Falkland Islands Police. Former British Foreign Minister [[Sir Alan Duncan]] offered his apologies to the Argentine Government, welcoming the enquiry. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/25/falkland-islands-police-investigate-vandalism-at-war-cemetery |title=Falkland Islands police investigate vandalism at war cemetery  |last=Ross |first=Alice |date=25 January 2017 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification using DNA==
As part of a joint project between the UK, Falkland Islands, Argentine Government and the International Committee of the [[Red Cross]] (ICRC), a forensic team [[Burial#Exhumation|exhumed]], analyzed and documented the remains in each of the unidentified graves in the Argentine cemetery with this DNA compared to that of surviving family members.  The [[DNA identification]] project was co-funded by the UK and Argentine Governments as a humanitarian initiative in line with international law.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/red-cross-identifies-88-argentines-killed-in-falklands-war/a-41622492 The 2 countries agree to try to identify the soldiers and divide the $1.5 million in related costs]&lt;/ref&gt;
On 13 September 2016 a UK-Argentina Joint Communication both countries expressed their full support for a DNA identification process in respect of all unknown Argentine soldiers buried in the Falkland Islands.  The ICRC's multinational 14-member forensic anthropology team began its efforts in June 2017 with samples analyzed in the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team's laboratory, and scientists in the United Kingdom and Spain confirmed the results of the DNA testing.

As of March 2018 the identity of Ninety bodies has been confirmed and more than 200 relatives of these soldiers were able to visit the actual grave for the first time. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/relatives-of-argentine-soldiers-killed-during-the-falklands-war-visit-the-argentine-cemetery-at-darwin Relatives of Argentine soldiers killed during the Falklands War visit the Argentine cemetery at Darwin]&lt;/ref&gt;.  On March 26 2018 Argentina’s Secretary for Human Rights, Claudio Avruj accompanied the Argentine families, along with retired British Army Colonel Geoffrey Cardozo, who was originally responsible for burying the Argentine dead immediately after the conflict.  The visit included a religious ceremony jointly conducted by Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires, [[Enrique Eguía Seguí|Bishop Eguia Segui]], and the [[Hugh Allan (prelate)|Right Reverend Abbott Hugh Allan]] from the United Kingdom.

The '''Battle of Chengpu''' took place in 632 BC between the State of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] and the State of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] and its allies during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Battle of Chengpu |url=http://history.cultural-china.com/en/34History2951.html |year=2007 |accessdate=26 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226061246/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/34History2951.html |archivedate=26 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first great battle in the protracted conflict between the states of the [[Yellow River]] valley, and the states of the [[Yangtze River]] valley. The Jin victory confirmed the hegemony of [[Duke Wen of Jin|Duke Wen]] and checked Chu ambitions in the north for at least a generation.&lt;ref name="Chengpu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Battle of Chengpu ( 城濮之战 ) |url=http://www.chinadetail.com/History/MilitaryDevelopmentChengpu.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507001151/http://www.chinadetail.com/History/MilitaryDevelopmentChengpu.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 May 2006 |year=2005 |accessdate=26 December 2009 }} chinadetail.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Following the death of [[Duke Huan of Qi]] in 643 BC, the state of Chu steadily extended its influence northward, absorbing half a dozen smaller states as its satellites. In 636 BC, Chong'er, a ducal prince of Jin, after spending fifteen years in exile traveling throughout numerous states, came to power as [[Duke Wen of Jin]] with the help of [[Duke Mu of Qin]]. Duke Wen assumed a position of leadership among the states and instituted numerous domestic reforms.

In the years leading up to 632 BC, conflict between Jin and Chu became increasingly public and was characterised by frequent shifts in alliances between the various small states that lay in a narrow band of land between the two larger states.&lt;ref name="Chengpu"/&gt;

[[King Cheng of Chu]] struck at the State of [[Song (state)|Song]], the ally of Jin most accessible from the south, in the winter of 633 BCE. In retaliation, an expeditionary force under Duke Wen marched south in the spring of the following year and occupied the States of [[Wei (state)|Wei]] and [[Cao (state)|Cao]], both satellites of Chu. The two sides sought out alliances in the following months. The States of [[Shen (state)|Shen]], [[Xi (state)|Xi]], [[Chen (state)|Chen]] and [[Cai (state)|Cai]], all immediately contiguous to Chu, sided with King Cheng, as well as the more distant [[Lu (state)|State of Lu]].&lt;ref name="Chengpu"/&gt;

==Prelude==
As promised by Duke Wen to King Cheng during his exile in Chu, the Jin army retired "three days march" (退避三舍) (45&amp;nbsp;km) before camping on the plain of Chengpu on the border of Wei and Cao, awaiting a decisive battle  The retirement also linked the Jin forces up with Qi and Qin reinforcements.

Only the central force of the Chu under Prime Minister [[Cheng Dechen|Ziyu]] (子玉) was made up entirely of Chu troops. The left wing under Zixi incorporated soldiers from Chu's close satellites Shen and Xi. The right wing under Zishang comprised completely a separate detachment from the armies of Chen and Cai, perhaps numbering around a third (?) of the entire force.

The Jin force was expanded before the expedition from two armies into three: the upper, the central and the lower; these three were then regrouped into wings before the battle: the upper army at the right wing under commander [[Hu Mao]] and vice-commander [[Hu Yan]], lower at left under [[Luan Zhi]] and vice [[Xu Chen (Zhou dynasty)|Xu Chen]], central remained at centre under [[Xian Zhen]] and vice [[Xi Zhen]]. Duke Wen did not direct or engage in the fighting.&lt;ref name="Chengpu"/&gt;

==Battle==
On the fourth day of the fourth month of 632 BC, the rival forces met.

The battle commenced with the advance of both wings of the Jin army. The Chu right wing was reckoned to be the weakest and Xu Chen, commander of the Jin left wing, attacked. Xu armoured his [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]] horses with tiger skins and launched an urgent, vigorous assault on the Chu right wing. The attack was rapidly successful, scattering and demolishing the enemy wing completely.

The Jin left then became a holding force, fixing the Chu center and preventing it from attacking the Jin centre or aiding the Chu left wing, since in either case the Jin left would have taken it in the flank and rear. Meanwhile, Hu Mao's Jin right wing had skirmished with the enemy, faked a retreat and carried with them the two great banners of the Jin commander-in-chief himself. The Chu left, made up of levies from the states of Shen and Xi, thought that the Jin right wing had lost and Ziyu ordered a pursuit. A contingent of chariots under Luan Zhi swept in front and dragged tree branches to raise a dust cloud and thereby obscure the movements of Hu Mao's men who were circling and reforming.

The Jin left aided by the Jin center continued to maintain their positions against the Chu center. Though the Jin centre was temporarily disordered by an intense whirlwind, it was effective in preventing the Chu center from supporting its left wing. As the Chu left advanced, it was caught in the flank by Duke Wen's bodyguards, composed of the sons of noble clansmen and sons of his close followers and thus flanked by the Jin central army. Meanwhile, the entire force of the Jin right wing completed its recircling and was supported on its right by Luan Zhi's chariots to join the assault. The Chu left was completely destroyed. Seeing both his wings enveloped, Ziyu ordered a general retreat.&lt;ref name="Chengpu"/&gt;

== Evaluation ==
The Battle of Chengpu is one of the biggest battles of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the most detailed in the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''. Nevertheless, the location of the battle remains obscure: two inconclusive possibilities are the vicinity of [[Chenliu]], [[Henan]] and the southwest area of [[Juancheng County]], [[Shandong]]. After returning to the north, Duke Wen was recognised by the King of [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] as first among the feudal lords. A multi-state conference at [[Jiantu]] in 631 BC headed by Duke Wen confirmed their support for the Zhou royal family and swore a covenant of alliance. The battle, however, was not effective in the long term in restricting the power of Chu.&lt;ref name="Chengpu"/&gt;

==Past Festivals==

Sponsored by the Smithsonian National Associate Program (see [[S. Dillon Ripley Center]]) and the NASM, the first annual Smithsonian Kite Carnival (later referred to as the Kite Festival) took place on the National Mall on March 25, 1967. Individuals could compete in contests with homemade kites as well as ready-made ones. The festival also included kite-making workshops led by Paul Garber, a lecture series, and a special display of kites made by Garber and his wife.&lt;ref name=first/&gt; 

However, an 1892 law that was still in effect barred the flying of kites, balloons and parachutes within the city limits of Washington, D.C.  In 1970, the Smithsonian Institution was therefore denied a permit to hold its annual kite flying carnival on the National Mall. On April 18, 1970, police arrested 11 people who were protesting the law by flying kites near the Washington Monument. As kite enthusiasts were not allowed to have the kite carnival that year in D.C., they moved the event to [[Fort Washington Park|Fort Washington]] in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].  The law was subsequently changed, permitting the kite carnival/festival to again be held on the National Mall.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125032205/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1061&amp;dat=19381027&amp;id=vd8kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BhEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2202%2C174045&amp;hl=en |archivedate=2016-01-25 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1061&amp;dat=19381027&amp;id=vd8kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BhEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2202,174045&amp;hl=en |title=Old Law Bans the Flying of Kites in Washington; Dueling Also Prohibited |5= |newspaper=Madison Lake Times |date=1938-10-27 |location=[[Madison Lake, Minnesota]] |accessdate=2016-01-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;br&gt;(2) {{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715052357/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C943781%2C00.html |archivedate=July 15, 2015 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943781,00.html |title=The Great Kite Bust |work=Nation |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1970-05-04 |accessdate=2016-01-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;br&gt;(3) {{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329100039/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/27/kite-festival-swoops-soars-into-dc/?page=all |archivedate=2014-03-29 |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/27/kite-festival-swoops-soars-into-dc/?page=all |title=UPDATE: Kite festival swoops, soars into D.C. on Sunday: Pros, amateurs, kids take to the skies Sunday |first=Emily |last=Hoosier |publisher=[[The Washington Times]] |date=2014-03-27 |accessdate=2016-01-24 |quote=“At one point it was illegal to fly a kite on the National Mall.

Thanks to their efforts in changing the law, amateurs, masters and spectators now peacefully flock to the Mall with their kites. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 Smithsonian Kite Festival was held on Saturday, March 29 on the National Mall.  The festival, which was tied to the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] to be held in [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], from August 8 to August 24, 2008, highlighted the art and history of Chinese kites. The Smithsonian stated that the Chinese introduced the first kites more than 2,000 years ago. According to the Smithsonian, the Chinese first used kites in military affairs for estimating distances and carrying propaganda leaflets, but the kites' influence gradually spread to Western countries to become what the Smithsonian called a “familiar artistic and cultural icon.” The Smithsonian stated that kites continue to play an important role in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Eric|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228204856/http://www.america.gov/st/peopleplace-english/2008/April/200804171436431xeneerg0.2525598.html|archivedate=2011-02-28|url=http://www.america.gov/st/peopleplace-english/2008/April/200804171436431xeneerg0.2525598.html|title=Kite-Flying Contest Part of U.S.-China Friendship Series:Smithsonian Institution program tied to 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing|work=America.gov|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|date=2008-04-17|accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 Smithsonian Kite Festival was held on Saturday, March 28, on the Washington Monument grounds. The theme of the festival was "Going Green". Participants were encouraged to create environmentally and thematically “green” kites from renewable resources such as bamboo and recyclable goods such as paper and cloth. Organizers expected to distribute 1,000 free kites to children on a first come, first served basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111011221/http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/43rd-annual-smithsonian-kite-festival-celebrates-environment-going-green|archivedate=2015-11-11 |url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/43rd-annual-smithsonian-kite-festival-celebrates-environment-going-green|title=The 43rd Annual Smithsonian Kite Festival Celebrates the Environment by Going Green|work=News Releases|publisher=Newsdesk: Newsroom of the Smithsonian Institution|date=2009-02-16|accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 Smithsonian Kite Festival, which the Smithsonian Associates and the NASM presented, took place on Saturday, March 27. The theme was "CRAFTed for Flight". Events included the competitive [[rokkaku dako|Rokkaku]] [[fighter kite|Battle]], Hot Tricks Showdown and Ground Display. The festival also featured a kitemaking competition that was open to any hand-made kite. Adult competitors and a team of judges ranging from kitemaking experts to local celebrities to museum staff chose the winners of awards in each category. Kitemakers were grouped according to experience and age: kitemaker, master kitemaker, age 11 and under, age 12–15. The event also encouraged non-competitors to make and fly kites on the Washington Monument grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611141007/http://kitefestival.org/awards.htm|archivedate=2007-06-11|url=http://kitefestival.org/awards.htm|title=Awards|work=44th Annual Smithsonian Kite Festival|publisher=[[S.

The [[Church of England]] commemorates many of the same [[saint]]s as those in the [[General Roman Calendar]], mostly on the same days, but also commemorates various notable (often post-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]) Christians who have not been [[Canonization|canonised]] by Rome, with a particular though not exclusive emphasis on those of [[England|English]] origin. There are differences in the calendars of other churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] (see [[Saints in Anglicanism]]).

The only person canonised in a near-conventional sense by the Church of England since the [[English Reformation]] is St Charles the Martyr ([[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]), although he is not widely recognised by Anglicans as a saint outside the [[Society of King Charles the Martyr]]. The Church of England has no mechanism for canonising saints, and unlike the Roman Catholic Church it makes no claims regarding the heavenly status of those whom it commemorates in its calendar. For this reason, the Church of England avoids the use of the prenominal title "Saint" with reference to uncanonised individuals and is restrained in what it says about them in its [[Liturgy|liturgical]] texts. In order not to seem to imply grades of sanctity, or to discriminate between holy persons of the pre- and post-Reformation periods, the title "Saint" is not used at all in the calendar, even with reference to those who have always been known by that title, for example the [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]].

The ninth [[Lambeth Conferences|Lambeth Conference]] held in 1958 clarified the commemoration of Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church in the Anglican Communion. Resolution 79 stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha|In the case of scriptural saints, care should be taken to commemorate men or women in terms which are in strict accord with the facts made known in Holy Scripture.|In the case of other names, the Kalendar should be limited to those whose historical character and devotion are beyond doubt.|In the choice of new names economy should be observed and controversial names should not be inserted until they can be seen in the perspective of history.|The addition of a new name should normally result from a widespread desire expressed in the region concerned over a reasonable period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2005 | url =  http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1958/1958-79.cfm| title = Resolutions from 1958: Resolution 79: The Book of Common Prayer - The Commemoration of Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church in the Anglican Communion | work = Lambeth Conference Resolutions Archive | publisher = Anglican Communion Office | accessdate = 2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no single calendar for the various churches making up the [[Anglican Communion]]; each makes its own calendar suitable for its local situation.  As a result, the calendar here contains a number of figures important in the history of the English church.  Calendars in different provinces will focus on figures more important to those different countries.  At the same time, different provinces often borrow important figures from each other's calendars as the international importance of different figures becomes clear.  In this way the calendar of the Church of England has importance beyond the immediate purpose of supporting the liturgy of the English Church. It is, for example, one of the key sources of the calendar for the international daily office Oremus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oremus.org/calendar.html], Oremus calendar&lt;/ref&gt;

As there is no mention of the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarchs of Old]] on the Current Church of England Calendar, one is left to presume, theologically and liturgically, that the Patriarchs of Old are not included on [[All Saints' Day]], 1 November (as they would be in the [[General Roman Calendar|General Vatican II Roman Calendar]]), since according to the Lambeth Conference, 1958, the purpose was to devise a guide for the commemoration of Saints and Heroes applicable to the Christian Church in England.

Holy Days are variously categorised as [[Principal Feast]]s, [[Festival (Church of England)|Festival]]s, [[Lesser Festival]]s, or [[Commemoration (observance)|Commemoration]]s. In order to minimise problems caused by the ambivalence regarding the manner of commemoration of uncanonised persons, all such days are Lesser Festivals or Commemorations only, whose observance is optional.

The following table lists the Holy Days in the calendar of ''[[Common Worship]]'', the calendar most generally followed in the Church of England (though the calendar of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' is still authorised for use). This calendar was finalised in 2000, with some further names added in 2010. The table includes the feast date, the name of the person or persons being commemorated, their title, the nature and location of their ministry or other relevant facts, and year of death, all in the form in which they are set out in the authorised ''Common Worship'' calendar. The typography shows the level of the observance: '''BOLD CAPITALS''' denote Principal Feasts and Principal Holy Days, '''bold''' denotes Festivals, roman denotes Lesser Festivals, and ''italics'' denote Commemorations. &lt;small&gt;SMALL CAPITALS&lt;/small&gt; denote observances that are unclassified.

'''Common assault''' was an [[offence (law)|offence]] under the [[common law]] of England, and has been held now to be a [[statutory]] offence in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. It is committed by a person who causes another person to apprehend the immediate use of unlawful violence by the [[defendant]]. It was thought to include [[battery (crime)|battery]] but it does not. In England and Wales, the penalty and mode of trial for this offence is now provided section 39 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]], and it has been held that the offence should be alleged as contrary to the statute because of this. It was also held that common assault and battery are two distinct offences, so that a charge that the accused "assaulted and battered" another person would be bad for [[Duplicity (law)|duplicity]] (the rule against charging more than one offence in a single count).

==Statute==
Section 39 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]] provides:

{{Blockquote|Common assault and battery shall be summary offences and a person guilty of either of them shall be liable to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/33/section/39|title=Criminal Justice Act 1988|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 13th September 2018, the [[Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018]] received Royal Assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018 — UK Parliament |url=https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2017-19/assaultsonemergencyworkersoffences.html |website=services.parliament.uk |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This added a subsection which states any common assault and/or battery on an emergency services worker is also now indictable and therefore subject to a maximum of 12 months if tried on indictment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018-Common assault and battery |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/23/section/1/enacted |website=www.legislation.gov.uk |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients of the offence==
Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 does not contain a definition of the expression "common assault" that appears there. What the offence actually consists of must be determined by reference to [[case law]].

A person commits an assault if they perform an act (which does not for this purpose include a mere omission to act) by which they intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate unlawful violence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Venna [1976] QB 421 at 429, 61 Cr App R 310 at 314, CA, Smith v Chief Superintendent of Woking Police Station, 76 Cr App R 234, DC, R v Ireland, R v Burstow [1998] AC 147, HL&lt;/ref&gt;

Both in the [[common law]] and under [[statute]], the ''[[actus reus]]'' of a common assault is committed when one person causes another to apprehend or fear that [[force]] is about to be used to cause some degree of personal contact and possible injury. There must be some quality of reasonableness to the apprehension on the part of the victim. If the physical contact is everyday social behaviour such as a handshake or friendly pat on the back, this is acceptable even though the victim may have a [[phobia]] although, if the defendant is aware of the psychological difficulty, this may be converted into an assault if the intention is to exploit the condition and embarrass the victim. More generally, if the defendant threatens injury tomorrow, the victim has the opportunity to take avoiding action. Thus, what is threatened must be capable of being carried out immediately. This would exclude a conditional threat. For example, if the defendant says that he would beat the living daylights out of you but for the presence of a police officer watching them both, the victim is supposed to understand that there is no immediate danger (''cf.'' ''[[Tuberville v Savage]]'''s "If it were not assize time I would not take such language from you"). But inequality in size can be disregarded so if a very small person threatens a very large person and it is obvious that the risk of any real injury from this attack is remote, the large person may nevertheless feel some degree of apprehension. Normally, both the one making the threat and the victim must be physically present because, otherwise, there would be no immediate danger. However, if a [[mobile phone]] is used to transmit the threat (whether orally or by [[SMS]]) and, from the words used, the victim reasonably understands that an attack is imminent, this may constitute an assault.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In ''[[Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' [1968] 1 QB 439&lt;/ref&gt; a police officer ordered the defendant to park his car and he reluctantly complied. In doing so, he accidentally drove the car on to the policeman’s foot and, when asked to remove the car, said "Fuck you, you can wait" and turned off the ignition. Because of the steel toe cap in his boot, the policeman's foot was not in actual danger, but the Divisional Court held that this could constitute an assault. Albeit accidentally, the driver had caused his car to rest on the officer's foot. This ''[[actus reus]]'' was a continuing act and the ''[[mens rea]]'' was formed during the relevant time (see [[concurrence]]). Whether realistically or not, the officer apprehended the possibility of injury so the offence was complete.

In ''[[R v. Ireland]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1998] AC 147&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that causing a person to apprehend violence can be committed by way of action or words. ''Words'' can also mean that otherwise threatening actions are rendered not capable of being an assault, as in the case of ''[[Tuberville v. Savage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(1669) 1 Mod 3, T.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the plaintiff told the defendant (while putting his hand on his sword) that he would ''not'' stab him, because the circuit judge was visiting town for the local assizes. On that basis, the defendant was deemed to have known that he was not about to be injured, and it was held that no assault had been committed by the plaintiff (which would otherwise have justified the defendant's allegedly pre-emptive strike).

The "immediacy" requirement has been the subject of some debate.  The leading case, again, is ''R v. Ireland''. Therein, the House of Lords held that the making of silent telephone calls could amount to an assault if it caused the victim to believe that physical violence might be used against him in the immediate future. One example of "immediacy" adopted by the House in that case was that a man who said, "I will be at your door in a minute or two," might (in the circumstances where those words amounted to a threat) be guilty of an assault.

See also ''[[R v. Constanza]]''.

===''Mens rea''===
The ''[[mens rea]]'' is that this fear must have been caused either [[intention (criminal law)|intentionally]] or [[recklessness (law)|recklessly]]. A battery is committed when the threatened force actually results in contact to the other and that contact was caused either intentionally or recklessly.

===Defences===

Self-defence is available when reasonable force is used to prevent harm to self or another.
Prevention of a greater crime or with the purpose of aiding a lawful arrest is also known as The Public Defence. The Private Defence or defence of property may be also be used as an argument. 
These arguments are not strictly defences but justifications for a certain level of force.

==Alternative verdict==
The original effect of sections 39 and 40 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]] was that common assault was not available as an [[alternative verdict]] under section 6(3) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].&lt;ref&gt;R v Mearns [1991] 1 QB 82, 91 Cr App R 312, [1990] 3 WLR 569, [1990] 3 All ER 989, [1990] Crim LR 708, CA&lt;/ref&gt;

Common assault is now available as an alternative verdict under section 6(3) of the Criminal Law Act 1967, by virtue of section 6(3A) of that Act (which was inserted by section 11 of the [[Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004]]).

==Whether it is a statutory offence==
In ''DPP v. Taylor'' and ''DPP v. Little''&lt;ref&gt;''DPP v. Little'' [1992] 1 QB 645, 95 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 28&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that common assault is a statutory offence, contrary to section 39 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]]. This decision was criticised&lt;ref&gt;''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1993 supplements and 1994 and 1996 editions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Hogan, ''Criminal Law'', 9th Ed, p.402&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Smith [1991] Crim LR 900&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Haystead v DPP''&lt;ref&gt;''Haystead v DPP'' 164 JP 396, DC,[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2000/181.html]&lt;/ref&gt; the Divisional court expressed the ''[[obiter]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]. 2004. Paragraph 19-178 at page 1746.&lt;/ref&gt; opinion that common assault remains a common law offence.

==Mode of trial and sentence==
In [[England and Wales]], it is a [[summary offence]]. However, where section 40 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]] applies, it can be an additional charge on an [[indictment]]. It is usually tried summarily.{{Quantify|date=February 2009}}

However it is tried, it is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding [[Standard scale#United Kingdom|level 5]] on the [[standard scale]], or both.

See [http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/common_assult/ Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual] for case law on sentencing. Relevant cases are:
*''R v [[Nottingham Crown Court]] ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions''&lt;ref&gt;''R v [[Nottingham Crown Court]] ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions'' [1996] 1 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 283&lt;/ref&gt;
*''R v Dunn''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Dunn [2003] 2 Cr App R (S) 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racially or religiously aggravated offence==

In England and Wales, section 29(1)(c) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] (c.37) creates the distinct offence of [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998#Racially or religiously aggravated offences|racially or religiously aggravated common assault]].

==Status of offence==
This is the least serious assault. It is not at all uncommon for more serious assault charges to be reduced to common assault in "plea-bargaining" by prosecutors to avoid the additional expense of a Crown Court trial should the defendant elect for same.  In real terms, the degree of fear or the level of injury required for a conviction can be unproven. No injury is required to prove battery.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A '''convergence center''' is a central place for information and meeting to serve participants during large and manifold [[Protests|protest]] or other alternative activities at [[Summit (meeting)|summits]]. 

They started to be used in the 1990s as a logistic tool to solve communication problems among the large number of people present at varying activities at [[European Union]] summits, sometimes also including living quarters.

A '''dance party''' (also referred to as a '''dance''') is a social gathering where [[dancing]] is the primary activity. Some dance parties are held in a casual setting and open to the public, such as a [[rave]], or those held in [[nightclub]]s and [[discothèque]]s. 

Other types of dance parties may be a formal or semi-formal private event which often require guests to don [[formal wear]] and have an invitation or membership within the community hosting the event, such as [[Dance party#School dances|school dance]]s and [[Cotillion ball|cotillions]]. 

Guests of formal dances often attend in pairs, as consorts or "dates" for one another. The term "stag" refers to going without a consort to a dance organized for couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=go stag - Idioms|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/go+stag|work=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dances commonly take place during the evening, although some are held earlier during the daytime; such events are known as [[tea dance]]s.

==Casual dances==
Casual dances are dances that do not have a formal dress requirement; these may include school and community events, raves, evening entertainments provided for guests aboard a [[cruise ship]], and events organized for certain holidays, such as [[Halloween]] and [[Mardis Gras]].

==School dances==

{{Further|:Category:School dances}}
A school dance is a dance sponsored by a school, and may be [[Casual wear|casual]] or [[Formal wear|formal]]. Casual school dances were originally limited to Western countries, although schools in other countries{{where?|date=September 2011}} are beginning to adopt such events.{{As of?|date=May 2012}} There are some schools, such as [[Arlington High School (Massachusetts)|Arlington High School]] in [[Arlington, Massachusetts]], that prohibit school-hosted dances, citing sex and alcohol problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/30/arlington-high-school-ban_n_1121038.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Carolyn | last=Gregoire | title=Should Schools Ban Dances Because Of Grinding? | date=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
{{main|Prom}}
One of the most significant school dances is [[prom]], a relatively formal event normally reserved for [[Junior (education)#High school|Junior]] grade and [[Senior (education)#High school|Senior]] grade students. Some schools host a [[winter formal]], a similar event, for the lower grades. In the 1950s, informal school dances in the United States were often called [[sock hop]]s. The traditional [[Sadie Hawkins dance]] may be formal or semi-formal.

==Formal dances==

One type of formal dance, known as a ball, is a dance event where guests [[formal wear|dress formally]]. In Western culture, a male may don [[white tie]] and a female may don a [[ball gown]]. Dinner dances are formal dances where dinner is served. Often, the style of music played at a ball is most suited to [[ballroom dancing]].

==Popularity==
{{globalize|section|date=September 2011}}
In Australia, dance parties are popular amongst [[teenagers]], to the point that many dance parties are held specifically for teenagers in [[nightclub]]s or other locations which allow [[underage]] guests, who are usually unable to attend such places due to [[local law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/CA256EB5000644CE/page/Listing-Liquor-Minors+on+licensed+premises?OpenDocument&amp;1=75-Liquor~&amp;2=0-Liquor~&amp;3=~ |last=Lygopoulos |first=Anna |title=Minors on licensed premises |publisher=[[Consumer Affairs Victoria]] |date=2007-10-19 |accessdate=2009-01-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723154235/http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/CA256EB5000644CE/page/Listing-Liquor-Minors+on+licensed+premises?OpenDocument&amp;1=75-Liquor~&amp;2=0-Liquor~&amp;3=~ |archivedate=2008-07-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music at dance parties is usually played through a [[public address|PA system]] or a more powerful [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]], and is often supplied by a [[DJ]] who selects and plays pre-[[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] songs from [[vinyl record]]s, [[compact disc]]s or with a [[laptop]]; however, some dance parties feature live instrumentalists or musicians playing their music live on an instrument, or with a laptop. Raves and other large,{{quantify|date=September 2011}} modern dance parties use [[visual effects|visual]] and [[lighting|lighting effect]]s, such as [[strobe light]]ing and [[fog machine|smoke machines]].{{clear}}

==Cultural milestones==
In the Jewish community, [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]] celebrations often involve dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705305033/Teen-party-disasters.html|title=Tips for avoiding teen party disasters|date=May 18, 2009|work=Deseret News|accessdate=16 November 2010|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dances are common for [[Quinceañera]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/quince-1.htm|title=Quinceañera Festivity|last=de la Cova|first=Tony|date=November 30, 2008|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteen]] parties and [[débutante]] celebrations. Some of these [[coming of age]] events involve a [[father-daughter dance]].

At [[wedding reception]]s, the [[newlywed]] couple may opt to have a [[first dance]] (before all guests are invited to participate on the dance floor).

A dance party that is gaining popularity is the [[Bollywood]] dance party, featuring music from [[Hindi]] cinema from [[India]]. A popular dance party that demonstrates this style of music and dance combination is produced by Wicked Karma &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wicked-karma.com|title=Wicked Karma|last=Christie|first=Lo|date=June 1, 2013|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is produced by Christie Lo and DJ RDX &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djrdxseattle.com|title=DJ RDX|last=Batra|first=Rohit|date=June 1, 2013|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nurai, a nightclub in [[Beirut]] hosted a party event on the 28th August 2017 and by August 30th 2017 it broke the [[Guinness World Record]] for hosting a 56-hour long party to show that it is the best party city in the world!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebanon Breaks Guinness World Record For Hosting The Longest Party In The World!|url=https://www.the961.com/lebanon-breaks-guinness-world-record-for-longest-party-in-the-world/|publisher=The 961|first=Grace|last=H|date=September 2, 2017|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beirut To Break The Record For World’s Longest Continuing Party At 56 Hours|url=https://stateofmind13.com/2017/08/15/beirut-to-break-the-record-for-worlds-longest-continuing-party-at-56-hours/|publisher=A Separate State of Mind|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialized events==
Some dance events may put an emphasis on certain genres of dance. For example, an event may feature [[swing dance|swing]] or [[square dance|square dancing]] rather than dancing in general.  A [[masked ball]] is a type of [[costume party]] that features dancing. Dance parties at which people mainly dance [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] are called [[Milonga (place)|Milongas]].

==Terminology==

The dark web has often been confused with the [[deep web]], which refer to the parts of the web not indexed (searchable) by search engines. This confusion dates back to at least 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beckett|first1=Andy|title=The dark side of the internet|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/nov/26/dark-side-internet-freenet|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=26 November 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908073158/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/nov/26/dark-side-internet-freenet|archivedate=8 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, especially in reporting on [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road]], the two terms have often been conflated,&lt;ref&gt;[[Deep Web (film)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daily Mail Reporter|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2454735/The-disturbing-world-Deep-Web-contract-killers-drug-dealers-ply-trade-internet.html|title=The disturbing world of the Deep Web, where contract killers and drug dealers ply their trade on the internet|accessdate=25 May 2015|date=11 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131030190858/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2454735/The-disturbing-world-Deep-Web-contract-killers-drug-dealers-ply-trade-internet.html|archivedate=30 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/145885/nasa-is-indexing-the-deep-web-to-show-mankind-what-google-wont/|title=NASA is indexing the 'Deep Web' to show mankind what Google won't|website=Fusion|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630010143/http://fusion.net/story/145885/nasa-is-indexing-the-deep-web-to-show-mankind-what-google-wont/|archivedate=2015-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite recommendations that they should be distinguished.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="confusion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightplanet.com/2014/03/clearing-confusion-deep-web-vs-dark-web/|title=Clearing Up Confusion – Deep Web vs. Dark Web|website=BrightPlanet|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516160539/http://www.brightplanet.com/2014/03/clearing-confusion-deep-web-vs-dark-web/|archivedate=2015-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Jane|title=The Deep Web vs. The Dark Web|url=http://blog.dictionary.com/dark-web/|accessdate=26 May 2015|date=6 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150509023641/http://blog.dictionary.com/dark-web/|archivedate=9 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=Hacker Lexicon: What Is the Dark Web?|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/11/hacker-lexicon-whats-dark-web/|accessdate=6 June 2015|date=19 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607062159/http://www.wired.com/2014/11/hacker-lexicon-whats-dark-web/|archivedate=7 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The darknet encryption technology routes users' data through a large number of intermediate servers, which protects the users' identity and guarantees anonymity. The transmitted information can be decrypted only by a subsequent node in the scheme, which leads to the exit node. The complicated system makes it almost impossible to reproduce the node path and decrypt the information layer by layer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cryptopolitik and the Darknet|journal=Survival (00396338)|volume= 58| issue = 1|pages= 7–38. 32p|doi=10.1080/00396338.2016.1142085|year=2016 | last1 = Moore | first1 = Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high level of encryption, websites are not able to track geolocation and IP of their users, and users are not able to get this information about the host. Thus, communication between darknet users is highly encrypted allowing users to talk, blog, and share files confidentially.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/20813843/DARKNET_SOCIAL_MEDIA_AND_EXTREMISM_ADDRESSING_INDONESIAN_COUNTERTERRORISM_ON_THE_INTERNET Darknet, Social Media, and Extremism: Addressing Indonesian Counterterrorism on the Internet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604003640/http://www.academia.edu/20813843/DARKNET_SOCIAL_MEDIA_AND_EXTREMISM_ADDRESSING_INDONESIAN_COUNTERTERRORISM_ON_THE_INTERNET |date=2017-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 the [[Congressional Research Service]] released an extensive report on the dark web, noting the changing dynamic of how information is accessed and presented on it; characterized by the unknown, it is of increasing interest to researchers, law enforcement, and policymakers.&lt;ref name="Congression Research Service Report"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44101.pdf |title=Dark Web |last=Finklea |first=Kristin |date=2017-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320192455/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44101.pdf |archivedate=2017-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, according to reportage, cybersecurity firms which specialize in monitoring and researching the dark web on behalf of banks and retailers routinely share their findings with the [[FBI]] and with other law enforcement agencies "when possible and necessary" regarding illegal content. The Russian-speaking underground offering a crime-as-a-service model is regarded as being particularly robust.&lt;ref name="Dark Web Mainstream Media Coverage"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/nation-world/national/article164797842.html |title=Shocked by gruesome crime, cyber execs help FBI on dark web |last=Johnson |first=Tim |date=2017-08-02 |website=Idaho Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journalism ==
Many individual [[journalist]]s, alternative [[News agency|news organizations]], educators, and researchers are influential in their writing and speaking of the Darknet, and making its use clear to the general public.

===Jamie Bartlett===
[[Jamie Bartlett (journalist)|Jamie Bartlett]] is a journalist and tech [[blogger]] for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' and Director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media for [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] in conjunction with [[The University of Sussex]]. In his book, ''The Dark Net'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-dark-netinside-the-digital-underworld-by-jamie-bartlett-book-review-9696473.html|title=The Dark Net:Inside the Digital Underworld by Jamie Bartlett, book review|last=Burrell|first=Ian|date=August 28, 2014|website=Independent|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620142200/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-dark-netinside-the-digital-underworld-by-jamie-bartlett-book-review-9696473.html|archivedate=June 20, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barlett depicts the world of the Darknet and its implications for human behavior in different context. For example, the book opens with the story of a young girl who seeks positive feedback to build her self-esteem by appearing naked online. She is eventually traced on social media sites where her friends and family were inundated with naked pictures of her. This story highlights the variety of [[Interpersonal relationship|human interactions]] the Darknet allows for, but also reminds the reader how participation in a [[overlay network]] like the Darknet is rarely in complete separation from the larger Web. Bartlett's main objective is an exploration of the Darknet and its implication for society. He explores different [[Subculture|sub-cultures]], some with positive implications for society and some with negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/growth-dark-subcultures-internet/|title=The Growth of Dark Subcultures On the Internet, The Leonard Lopate Show|date=June 2, 2015|website=WNYC|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020043736/http://www.wnyc.org/story/growth-dark-subcultures-internet/|archivedate=October 20, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartlett gave a [[TED (conference)|TEDTalk]] in June 2015 further examining the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_bartlett_how_the_mysterious_dark_net_is_going_mainstream#t-705685|title=How the mysterious dark net is going mainstream|last=Bartlett|first=Jamie|date=June 2015|website=ted.com|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020042728/https://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_bartlett_how_the_mysterious_dark_net_is_going_mainstream#t-705685|archivedate=2016-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His talk, entitled "How the mysterious Darknet is going mainstream", introduces the idea behind the Darknet to the audience, followed by a walkthrough example of one of its websites called [[The Silk Road (anonymous marketplace)|the Silk Road]]. He points out the familiarity of webpage design similar to consumer sites used in the larger commercial Web. Bartlett then presents examples of how operating in an uncertain, high-risk market like those in the Darknet actually breeds innovation that he believes can be applied to all markets in the future. As he points out, because vendors are always thinking of new ways to get around and protect themselves, the Darknet has become more decentralized, more customer friendly, harder to censor, and more innovative. As our societies are increasingly searching for more ways to retain privacy online, such changes as those occurring in the Darknet are not only innovative, but could be beneficial to commercial online websites and markets.

===Other media===

Traditional media and news channels like [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] have also featured articles examining the Darknet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-27/explainer-what-is-the-dark-net/7038878|title=Print Email Facebook Twitter More What is the dark net, and how will it shape the future of the digital age?|last=Viney|first=Steven|date=January 27, 2016|website=ABC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020060907/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-27/explainer-what-is-the-dark-net/7038878|archivedate=October 20, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine published an article in October 2016 entitled "The Other Internet". The article discusses the rise of the Dark Net and mentions that the stakes have become high in a lawless digital wilderness. It mentions that vulnerability is a weakness in a network's defenses. Other topics include the [[e-commerce]] versions of conventional black markets, cyberweaponry from TheRealDeal, and role of operations security.&lt;ref name="The Other Internet"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Other Internet|journal=Vanity Fair|volume=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Edinburgh International Festival''' is an annual festival of [[performing arts]] in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, over three weeks in August. By invitation from the Festival Director, the International Festival brings top class performers of music (especially [[european classical music|classical music]]), theatre, opera and dance from around the world to perform. The festival also hosts a series of visual art exhibitions, talks and workshops.

==History==
[[File:The Last Hotel 4297-Peralta.jpg|thumb|left|[[Claudia Boyle]] and [[Robin Adams]] in ''The Last Hotel'' by [[Enda Walsh]] and [[Donnacha Dennehy]], Edinburgh 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;Photo by Francisco Peralta Torrejón&lt;/small&gt;]]
The idea of a Festival with a remit to "provide a platform for the flowering of the human spirit" and enrich the cultural life of Scotland, Britain and Europe took form in the wake of the [[Second World War]]. The idea of creating an international festival within the UK was first conceived by [[Rudolf Bing]], the General Manager of [[Glyndebourne Opera Festival]], and [[Audrey Mildmay]] (wife of [[John Christie (opera manager)|John Christie]]) during a wartime tour of a small-scale Glyndebourne production of ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fifield, Christopher. ''Ibbs and Tillett: The Rise and Fall of a Musical Empire''. Ashgate, 2005: p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudolf Bing co-founded the Festival with [[Harvey Wood (arts figure)|Henry Harvey Wood]], Head of the [[British Council]] in Scotland, Sidney Newman, Reid Professor of Music at [[Edinburgh University]], and a group of civic leaders from the City of Edinburgh, in particular Sir [[John Ireland Falconer|John Falconer]].

Bing had looked at several English cities before shifting his focus to Scotland and settling on Edinburgh, a city he had visited and admired in 1939. Harvey Wood described the meeting at which the idea was hatched:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Edinburgh International Music of Festival and Drama was first discussed over a lunch table in a restaurant in [[Hanover Square, London|Hanover Square]], [[London]], towards the end of 1944. Rudolf Bing, convinced that musical and operatic festivals on anything like the pre-war scale were unlikely to be held in any of the shattered and impoverished centres for many years to come, was anxious to consider and investigate the possibility of staging such a Festival somewhere in the United Kingdom in the summer of 1946. He was convinced and he convinced my colleagues and myself that such an enterprise, successfully conducted, might at this moment of European time, be of more than temporary significance and might establish in Britain a centre of world resort for lovers of music, drama, opera, ballet and the graphic arts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain preconditions were obviously required of such a centre. It should be a town of reasonable size, capable of absorbing and entertaining anything between 50,000 and 150,000 visitors over a period of three weeks to a month. It should, like Salzburg, have considerable scenic and picturesque appeal and it should be set in a country likely to be attractive to tourists and foreign visitors. It should have sufficient number of theatres, concert halls and open spaces for the adequate staging of a programme of an ambitious and varied character. Above all it should be a city likely to embrace the opportunity and willing to make the festival a major preoccupation not only in the City Chambers but in the heart and home of every citizen, however modest. Greatly daring but not without confidence I recommended Edinburgh as the centre and promised to make preliminary investigations.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bruce, ''Festival in the North: The story of the Edinburgh Festival'', London: Robert Hale, 1975, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wood approached Falconer, who enthusiastically welcomed the initiative on behalf of the city.  As it was too late to finalise arrangements for 1946, plans were made for the following year. The first International Festival (and the first [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|"Festival Fringe"]], although not known as such in the first year) took place between 22 August and 11 September 1947. The Festival has since taken place every August.

The first Festival concentrated mainly on classical music, a highlight being concerts given by the [[Vienna Philharmonic]], reunited with their erstwhile conductor [[Bruno Walter]] who had left Europe after the [[Anschluss|Nazi occupation of his homeland]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, ''Festival in the North'' (1975), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Festival's first dramatic success came in the following year when an adaptation of [[David Lindsay (poet)|Sir David Lyndsay]]'s ''[[A Satire of the Three Estates|The Thrie Estaites]]'' was performed to great acclaim for the first time since 1552 in the Assembly Hall on the Mound.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, ''Festival in the North'' (1975), pp. 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Army's desire to showcase itself during the Festival period led to the independent staging of the first [[Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo|Edinburgh Military Tattoo]], featuring displays of piping and dancing, in 1950. This annual event has come to be regarded as an integral part of the official festival, though it continues to be organised separately.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, ''Festival in the North'' (1975), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
[[File:Former Tolbooth Church, Castlehill, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|The 240-foot-high spire of the Hub, seen from Johnston Terrace]]
In 1999, the Festival opened a new central box office and information centre in [[The Hub (Edinburgh)|The Hub]], a converted church on [[Royal Mile#Castle Esplanade and Castlehill|Castlehill]], directly below [[Edinburgh Castle]]. Originally built as the Tolbooth Church (1842-44) to house the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], its tall [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] spire is the highest point in central Edinburgh (outside of the Castle) and a landmark visible for miles around.

The Edinburgh International Festival was brought forward to coincide with the Fringe in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edinburgh international festival moves dates for 2015 as part of shakeup |author=Severin Carrell| url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/may/08/edinburgh-international-festival-2015-moves-dates-fringe|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other festivals in Edinburgh==
About ten other festivals are held in Edinburgh at about the same time as the International Festival.  Collectively, the entire group is referred to as the [[Edinburgh Festival]].  Most notable of these is the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], which started as an offshoot of the International Festival and has since grown to be the world's largest arts festival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1922">'''Fèis Bharraigh''' is an annual Gaelic arts and culture event, held on Barra. The first event was held in 1981.&lt;ref name="Gazette 12Jan2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stornowaygazette.co.uk/news/local-headlines/celebrating-25-years-of-the-feis-movement-1-116675 |title=Celebrating 25 years of the Feis movement |work=[[Stornoway Gazette]] |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events continue to promote, encourage, foster and develop the practice and study of the [[Scottish Gaelic language]], literature, music, drama and culture on the islands of [[Barra]] and [[Vatersay]].

The Fèis movement came about when a group of parents and other individuals on the Isle of Barra became concerned that local traditions were dying out and that island children were not being taught traditional music in the context of formal education. This first Fèis, which means "festival" in Gaelic, laid down the path for many more Fèisean, inspired by the success of the first Fèis, to spring up around Scotland with each one community led and tailored to local needs. By 2007, there were 40 Fèisean held across Scotland.&lt;ref name="Gazette 12Jan2007" /&gt;

In 2007, Fèis Bharraigh launched "BarraFest - Live @ the Edge", a weekend festival of traditional and modern Scottish music held on the [[Tangasdale]] [[machair]]. BarraFest 2008 was held on 25–26 July.&lt;ref name = events&gt;[http://www.barra-accommodation.co.uk/events.php " Isle of Barra Events"]  Barra Accommodation. Retrieved 17 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
The '''Hong Kong''' economy officially slid into recession in the final quarter of 2008. The economy is predicted to grow at 2 percent in 2009. Hong Kong is an advanced tertiary economy built on services, retail, tourism, transport and financial industries. Hong Kong's manufacturing industry is located in Guangdong province which employs over 11 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John |last=Chan |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/hong-n21.shtml |title=Hong Kong enters recession |work=World Socialist Web Site |publisher=International Committee of the Fourth International |date=21 November 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hang Seng Index has lost over 60 percent of its value, property market lost over 40 percent in value and unemployment is at a record high of 4.8 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_economy/160180.stm |title=The Economy - Hong Kong battles recession and speculators |publisher=BBC News |date=August 28, 1998 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
'''Taiwan''' announced billions of dollars in spending and tax cuts due to declining growth and a 26 percent slump in the stock market in 2008.&lt;ref name=NZTaiwan&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/money/2008/09/11/bcnkiwi111.xml|title=New Zealand slashes rates as economy lurches toward recession|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=2008-09-11|accessdate=2008-09-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] raised concerns about global exposure to the assets and stock of Lehman Brothers and the potential for the bankruptcy to cause further tightening of credit. Taiwan, despite reporting few losses from the subprime mortgage crisis, was said to have Lehman-related exposure for its companies and retail investors totaling $2.5 billion. To increase purchasing power, the ROC government has issued the [[ROC consumer voucher]].

===Japan===
{{See also|Lost Decade (Japan)}}
In '''Japan''' exports in June declined for the first time in about five years falling by 1.7 percent. Exports to the United States and European Union fell 15.4 percent and 11.2 percent respectively. The decline in exports and increase in imports cut Japan's trade surplus $1.28 billion a decline of 90 percent from the previous year. An economist at the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] said the decline means the Japanese economy most likely declined in the second quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/gc04/idUST1165520080724|title=Japan exports shrink as global downturn hits Asia|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-07-24|accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taro Aso]], secretary-general of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, said he believes Japan had entered a recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSTKF00327920080805|title=Japan ruling party's Aso: Economy in a recession|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-08-05|accessdate=2008-08-10 | first=Chisa | last=Fujioka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
By September 2008, the crisis threatening the GSEs (US mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) began to have consequences in Asia. The foreign exchange reserves of '''South Korea's''' central bank contained many depreciating "Agency bonds" from the GSEs, threatening a currency crisis and leading to depreciation of the [[South Korean won]] against the US dollar and other major currencies,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article4648549.ece |title=South Korea heads for black September with won problems - Times Online |publisher=Business.timesonline.co.uk |author=Leo Lewis in Seoul |date= 2008-09-01|accessdate=2008-10-01 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung Electronics has been reported to be posting a decrease in sales for the first time since the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] that home appliances saw a decrease in the domestic market of up to 20 percent since mid-June compared to the previous year.

In January 2009, Malaysia has banned the hiring of foreign workers in factories, stores and restaurants to protect its citizens from mass unemployment amid the global economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2009/01/20091228418535985.html Malaysia bans foreign labourers], Al Jazeera English, January 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced that some foreign companies would fire workforce in [[Malaysia]]. In 2009 GDP contracted 1.7%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53%3Agross-domestic-product-gross-national-income-updated-18082010&amp;catid=35%3Akey-statistics&amp;Itemid=53&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===

Unlike the other economies in the region, The Philippines was the only one of a mere handful of countries in the whole world to have recorded a positive economic growth in 2009 and averted the effects of economic recession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2008&amp;ey=2008&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=548%2C273%2C223%2C924%2C566%2C199%2C578%2C534%2C186&amp;s=PPPGDP&amp;grp=0&amp;a=&amp;pr.x=44&amp;pr.y=13 IMF World Economic Outlook Database, April 2009.] GDP-PPP figures of selected NIC countries for 2007 and 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not mean that the country experienced no effect of the ongoing world financial crisis. The economy was based on the remittances of the [[Overseas Filipinos|Overseas Filipino Workers]], most of them working in affected countries like the United States.

The strict regulations imposed by the central bank were crafted to make the [[economy of Lebanon|Lebanese economy]] immune to political crisis; and so far, this has applied to the global economic crisis as well. The Lebanese banks remain, under the current circumstances, high on liquidity and reputed for their security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7764657.stm|title= Lebanon 'immune' to financial crisis|publisher= BBC News |date= 5 December 2008 | accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts pointed that India's growing trade with other Asian countries, especially China, will help reduce the negative impact of the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7733797.stm|title=

In May 2009, India reported an economic growth rate of 5.8%, beating most forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hXx0bRRIygHac3I-s5wYlxHwQLXQ India economic growth beats forecasts]&lt;/ref&gt; In second quarter of 2009 the Indian economy grew by 7.9% and gave indications that the Indian economy would scale a growth rate of 7% or above in 2009 and 8-9% in 2010. In the 3rd Quarter of 2010, the economy had bounced back with a growth rate of 8.8%.

===Pakistan===
In '''Pakistan''' the central bank's foreign currency reserves, when counting forward liabilities is said to only amount to as little as $3 billion, sufficient for a single month of imports. Corruption and mismanagement have combined with high oil prices to damage Pakistan's economy. Pakistan's rupee has lost more than 21 per cent of its value in 2008 and inflation is at 25 per cent. The government has failed to defer payments for Saudi oil or raise favorable loans. President [[Asif Ali Zardari]] claimed Pakistan needed a bailout worth $100 billion which he was expected to ask for at a meeting in Abu Dhabi in November. Ratings agency [[Standard and Poor's]] rates Pakistan's sovereign debt at CCC +, only a few ratings above the default level, warning the country may be unable to cover about $3 billion in upcoming debt payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/3147266/Pakistan-facing-bankruptcy.html|title=Pakistan facing bankruptcy|publisher=Daily Telegraph|last=Wilkinson|first=Isambard|date=2008-09-16|accessdate=2008-09-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led a change in economic managers, and politically elected finance minister [[Naveed Qamar]] was replaced by a financial advisor, [[Shaukat Tareen]], a former banker belonging to Citigroup on October 8, 2008. The new finance advisor led the Pakistani delegation to IMF-World Bank meeting in USA with a hope to obtain a loan from the World Bank which has been stopped now due to reservations from IMF on World Bank for releasing this nature of Loan to any country.
the situation in the Pakistan is seems to be revealed to progress. as in the budget for 2013-2014 taxes has been implemented to recover the income of the government through masses.

===Sri Lanka===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}

'''Sri Lanka''' too is affected with the global recession, as the demand for their major products such as garments, tea, rubber, coconut based products and agricultural products are at a downturn. At the moment, tea is severely affected and the country is experiencing 35% drop in the exports presently.  Also, the tourist industry has downsized; last year, there was a 7% downsize to the industry, primarily due to the loss of [[Europe]]an tourists.

The first '''International Exposition of Electricity''' in Paris ran from August 15, 1881 through to November 15, 1881 at the [[Palais de l'Industrie]] on the [[Champs-Élysées]]. It served to display the advances in electrical technology since the small electrical display at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Universal Exposition]].&lt;ref name=Beauchamp97&gt;K. G. Beauchamp, '' Exhibiting electricity''
IET, 1997 {{ISBN|0-85296-895-7}},  pp.160-165&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitors came from the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[the Netherlands]], as well as from France.  As part of the exhibition, the first International Congress of Electricians presented numerous scientific and technical papers, including definitions of the standard practical units [[volt]], [[ohm]] and [[ampere]].&lt;ref name=Beauchamp97/&gt;

==History==
[[Adolphe Cochery]], Minister of Posts and Telegraphs of the time, had initially suggested that an international exposition should be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

This show was a great stir.  The public could admire the [[dynamo]] of [[Zénobe Gramme]], the [[incandescent light]], the [[Théâtrophone]], the electric tramway of  [[Werner von Siemens]], the [[telephone]] of [[Alexander Graham Bell]], an [[electrical distribution]] network by [[Marcel Deprez]], and an [[electric boat]] by [[Gustave Trouvé]]. As part of the exhibition, the first International Congress of Electricians, which met in the halls of the [[Trocadéro|Palais du Trocadero]], presented numerous scientific and technical papers, including definitions of the standard practical units [[volt]], [[ohm]] and [[ampere]],&lt;ref name=Beauchamp97/&gt; the [[International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units]].

George Berger was the Commissioner General. Aside from the provision of the building by the French government, the exhibition was privately financed. Organizers would donate profits to scientific works in the public interest.

== International Congress of Electricians ==

This congress was a decisive step in the building of the modern [[International System of Units]] (SI), since [[ohm]], [[ampere]], [[coulomb]] and [[farad]] were defined at this occasion. Main participants include [[Éleuthère Mascart]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (who later became [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]]), [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Gustav Kirchhoff]], [[Gustav Heinrich Wiedemann]], [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens]] and his brother the industrialist [[Werner von Siemens]], who had to renounce to the [[Siemens mercury unit|siemens mercury]] as the resistance unit (not to be confused with [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]], current SI unit of conductance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dans les coulisses du Congrès international des électriciens de 1881|url=http://www.ampere.cnrs.fr/histoire/parcours-historique/unites-electriques/congres1881|access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
[[File:Theatrophone - Clement Ader 1881.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Using the described [[Théâtrophone]] apparatus, visitors could hear the live opera two kilometres away.]]
Among the exhibits were:

* Apparatus for production and transmission of electricity,
* natural and artificial magnets, and compasses,
* devices used in the study of electricity,
* many applications of electricity (sound, heat, light, electroplating, electrochemistry, signage, power,industrial applications, agricultural and domestic),
* lightning,
* old instruments in connection with electricity.

Electric lighting with [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent lamps]] was one of key developments on display at the exposition, with up to 2500 lamps used to light the venue. The lamps of [[Thomas Edison]], [[St. George Lane Fox-Pitt|St. George Lane-Fox]], [[Hiram Maxim]], and [[Joseph Swan]] were compared in extensive tests by a committee, including exposition juror [[William Crookes]], to establish the most efficient lamp design.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, Volume 11, page 230&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion was the high resistance Edison lamp was the most efficient, followed by the Lane-Fox, Swan, and Maxim lamps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iX89AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;ots=cRK6KTjx5F&amp;dq=%22International%20Exposition%20of%20Electricity%22%20William%20Crookes%20light&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Electrical Journal, Volume 9, 1882, page 107]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JunaCon''' is an annual [[board game]] convention held in [[Turku]], [[Finland]] since 2010. It is usually held in late winter or early spring. The convention concentrates on [[railroad]]-themed board games, such as ''[[18XX]]'', ''[[Ticket to Ride (board game)|Ticket to Ride]]'' and ''[[TransAmerica (board game)|TransAmerica/TransEuropa]]''. The convention's name comes from the [[Finnish language]] word "''juna''" ("train") and "-con", short for "convention". The convention also hosts the annual ''Ticket to Ride'' Finnish championship, the winner of which is eligible for the ''Ticket to Ride'' official world championship in [[Paris]], [[France]] later in the year.

'''''Killer Legends''''' is a 2014 American documentary written and directed by Joshua Zeman for [[Chiller (TV channel)|Chiller]].  Zeman and Rachel Mills, a researcher, investigate the real-life origins of several [[urban legend]]s.

== Synopsis ==
Joshua Zeman and Rachel Mills investigate the origins of several urban legends:

; The Hookman
: In [[The Hook]], a man with a hook for a hand attempts to murder teenagers who park in a [[lovers' lane]].  Zeman and Mills trace this to the [[Texarkana Moonlight Murders]], an unsolved crime that was the basis for the early slasher film ''[[The Town That Dreaded Sundown]]''.  Zeman and Mills compare and contrast the film to the real-life events, and both to the urban legend.  Neither the real-life events nor the film feature a killer with a hook for a hand, but they do have a serial killer who preys upon teenagers who make out at a lovers' lane.

; The Candyman
: Zeman and Mills travel to Houston, Texas, to investigate the [[Poisoned candy myths|urban legend of poisoned candy]].  Though they dismiss the widespread belief that strangers have handed out poisoned candy to neighborhood children, Zeman and Mills describe [[Ronald Clark O'Bryan]], a man who poisoned his own son for insurance money and used the urban legend to deflect suspicion from himself.  To mask his son's murder, O'Bryan also attempted to kill several other children, but they did not eat their poisoned candy.  O'Bryan was convicted and executed for the crimes.

; The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs
: In Columbia, Missouri, Zeman and Mills investigate the legend of [[The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs]], in which a babysitter is harassed and ultimately killed by a man already inside the house.  Although there are no documented cases of serial killers who have targeted babysitters, Zeman and Mills describe how Janett Christman was murdered while babysitting.  An African-American man was convicted and executed for the murder, but Zeman and Mills question whether he was guilty.  They instead point to an acquaintance who knew Christman was babysitting and had become obsessed with her.

; The Killer Clown
: In Chicago, Zeman and Mills investigate the [[evil clown]] trope and associated "phantom clown" sightings across the world.  In these cases, children report having seen a suspicious clown that attempts to entice them into an unmarked van, presumably to kidnap them.  Zeman and Mills express skepticism and explain it as a manifestation of [[coulrophobia]], the fear of clowns.  They trace this urban legend to [[John Wayne Gacy]], a serial killer who unrelatedly worked as a clown.  Although Gacy never killed anyone while dressed as clown, they state that his infamy popularized the trope.

== Cast ==
* Rachel Mills
* Joshua Zeman

== Production ==
After directing ''[[Cropsey (film)|Cropsey]]'', a documentary that examines the similarities between a New York urban legend and a real-life kidnapper, Zeman approached Chiller with the idea of a series based on the intersection of urban legends and true crime.  For business reasons, the series was retooled into an anthology TV film.  Clowns were not initially planned to be a subject covered in the documentary, but Mills uncovered a large amount of information on them.  Upon bringing this to Zeman's attention, he agreed to expand the documentary to include them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killerreviews.com/forums/entry.php?1224-Interview-with-Rachel-Mills-amp-Joshua-Zeman-%93Killer-Legends%94|title=Interview with Rachel Mills &amp; Joshua Zeman, "Killer Legends"|last=Schmitt|first=Gavin|work=KillerReviews.com|date=2014-07-17|accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8962">This is a list of major hydroelectric power station failures due to damage to a [[hydroelectric power station]] or its connections.  Every generating station trips from time to time due to minor defects and can usually be restarted when the defect has been remedied. Various protections are built into the stations to cause shutdown before major damage is caused. Some hydroelectric power station failures may go beyond the immediate loss of generation capacity, including destruction of the [[turbine]] itself, [[reservoir]] breach and significant destruction of [[Electrical grid|national grid infrastructure]] downstream.  These can take years to remedy in some cases.

Where a generating station is large compared to the connected grid capacity, any failure can cause extensive disruption with in the network.  A serious failure in a proportionally large hydroelectric generating station or its associated [[transmission line]] will remove a large block of power from the grid that may lead to widespread disturbances.

Ndaakoya&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghanaculture.gov.gh/index1.php?linkid=65&amp;archiveid=176&amp;page=1&amp;adate=04/02/2006&lt;/ref&gt; is a festival celebrated by the [[Frafra language|Frafra]], [[Talensi-Nabdam District|Talensi,]] and Nabdan speaking communities in the [[Upper East Region]] Of [[Ghana]]. It is usually celebrated in the early months of every new year&lt;ref&gt;https://thechronicle.com.gh/let-education-be-your-priority/&lt;/ref&gt; (January and February) to thank God for a successful [[harvest]] during the farming season.

== History ==
The word Ndaakoya comes from two Frafra words: Ndaa meaning "during that time" or "days", and Koya meaning "I have farmed" or "farming". And so it follows that the word Ndaakoya means "during that time I farmed". The Ndaakoya festival is the main festival celebrated by the Frafra, Talensi and the Nabdan communities in the Upper East Region. Together, these groups of people form the majority of the population of the region. The celebration of the festival is an inherited ritual performed by these tribes to appease the gods of their land by thanking them for a good harvest. Their forefathers believed that good yields during harvest, the provision of rain, sunshine and other factors necessary for stimulating good harvest was the handiwork of the gods they served and hence needed to thank the gods for a wonderful harvest.

It is a peaceful celebration which also sought to foster unity among the people.&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/200811050526.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its celebration always sees different people, from all corners of the region, trooping in to witness the wonderful displays of culture, music and dance. Even though the festival is celebrated every year by the [[Bolgatanga|Bolga]] Chief (known as Bolga Naaba), every household is expected to celebrate this festival annually in their own way for the same purpose. Apart from the display of music and dance that takes place during the celebration of the festival, libation is poured, food prepared and drinks served for merry-making. Influential people are also invited from all areas of the region and other regions to come and observe the celebration of the festival. [[Pito (beer)|Pito]] the popular "local beer" of the region is commonly served during the celebration. This is prepared using part of the gains made during harvest. It is prepared using guinea corn or what has become known as "red millet". This is brought by individuals from their homes as a token for appeasing the gods.

'''Nicholas John "Nick" Piantanida''' (August 15, 1932 – August 29, 1966) was an American amateur [[Parachuting|parachute]] jumper who reached 123,500 feet (37,642 meters, 23.39 miles)&lt;ref name=Pre-Astronauts&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Craig|title=The Pre-Astronauts: Manned Ballooning on the Threshold of Space|year=2003|publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]]|location=[[Annapolis, Maryland]]|isbn=1-55750-732-5|pages=258–269|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1QS38bu9iTwC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=Nick+Piantanida+123,500#v=onepage&amp;q=Nick%20Piantanida%20123%2C500&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Magnificent&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Craig|title=Magnificent Failure: Free Fall from the Edge of Space|year=2003|publisher=[[Smithsonian Books]]|isbn=978-1588341419|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w6BfBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=FP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Betancourt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betancourt|first=Mark|journal=[[Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian]]|date=July 2012|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/the-120000-foot-leap-94541557/|title=The 120,000-Foot Leap|accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chutist Changes Mind 123,500 Feet in Sky|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/02/03/archives/chutist-changes-mind-123500-feet-in-sky.html|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 2, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his ''Strato Jump II'' balloon on February 2, 1966, flying a manned balloon higher than anyone before, a record that stood until [[Felix Baumgartner]]'s flight on October 14, 2012.

==Early life==
Piantanida was born August 15, 1932, and grew up in [[Union City, New Jersey]]. He had a younger brother, Vern. When Piantanida was 10 years old, he experimented with homemade parachutes, harnessing a stray neighborhood cat to one in a test drop off the five-story apartment building where they lived. When a neighbor informed Piantanida's parents of this, Piantanida tested the next parachute himself, jumping off a lower roof and breaking his arm. As he grew older, he took up skydiving with a "dogged determination", according to his brother.&lt;ref name=NJ.com&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherman|first=Ted|date=October 12, 2012|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/10/a_deadly_fall_46_years_ago_a_j.html|title=A deadly fall: 46 years ago, a Jersey daredevil died while trying to set record|journal=[[The Star-Ledger]]|accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man, Piantanida played [[basketball]] in [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] leagues.&lt;ref name=Magnificent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Manliness&gt;{{cite web|last=McKay|first=Brett &amp; Kate|title=Skydiving from Space Part II: Nick Piantanida’s "Magnificent Failure"|url=http://artofmanliness.com/2010/10/07/skydiving-from-space-part-ii-nick-piantanidas-magnificent-failure/|publisher=The Art of Manliness|date=October 7, 2010|accessdate=August 8, 2015}} This article mistakenly gives Piantanida's date of death as August 25, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, he joined the [[U.S. Army Reserve]] and shortly thereafter, the [[U.S. Army]] for two years, where he earned the rank of [[corporal]].&lt;ref name=Magnificent/&gt;

After his military service, Piantanida and his climbing partner, Walt Tomashoff, became the first people to climb a route on the north side of [[Auyantepui]], the plateau in [[Venezuela]] from which [[Angel Falls]] drops from a cleft near the summit.&lt;ref name=Magnificent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Life&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaughan|first=Roger|title=Heroic Sky-Dive Venture|journal=Life|date=13 May 1966|volume=60|issue=19|pages=32–39|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IVYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=janice+mcdowell+%2BPiantanida#v=onepage&amp;q=janice%20mcdowell%20%2BPiantanida&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this accomplishment he was interviewed on the ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]''.&lt;ref name=Magnificent/&gt;

After his return to the United States, Piantanida worked in an embroidery factory, played basketball at various colleges, and worked as an [[ironworker]] on the [[Verrazano Narrows Bridge]].&lt;ref name=Manliness/&gt;

==Skydiving career==
[[File:Strato-Jump III gondola.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''Strato Jump III'' gondola at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum]]
In 1963, Piantanida was living in [[Brick Township, New Jersey]], and had a business selling pets when he discovered skydiving. One day after watching jumps at the then new Lakewood Sport Parachuting Center near [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood]], he began taking lessons and jumping regularly. After making hundreds of jumps and earning a class D expert license, he learned of the {{convert|83,000|ft|m|adj=on}} jump from a balloon by [[Yevgeni Nikolayevich Andreyev|Yevgeni Andreyev]] that gave the official world record for the highest parachute jump to the Soviet Union, and determined to bring the world record back to the United States.&lt;ref name=Pre-Astronauts/&gt; (The unofficial record, which Piantanida was also trying to break, was held by [[Joseph Kittinger]] of the U.S.)

Piantanida took a job driving trucks in order to give him time to train on weekends. He earnestly studied meteorology, balloon technology and survival systems.&lt;ref name=Pre-Astronauts/&gt; As author Craig Ryan put it, he "transformed himself into the director of a one-man aeronautical research program."&lt;ref name=Manliness/&gt; He obtained money from sponsors, and, after lobbying by a United States Senator, the [[United States Air Force]] gave him access to training facilities and [[David Clark Company]] loaned him a [[pressure suit]].&lt;ref name=Manliness/&gt; He assembled a team of volunteers for an attempt at the world free-fall record.&lt;ref name=NJ.com/&gt;

On October 22, 1965, Piantanida made his first attempt at the record in his balloon named ''Strato Jump I''. The attempt ended when a [[wind shear]] tore off the top of his balloon, ending the flight at just {{convert|16,000|ft}} and forcing Piantanida to parachute into the [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] city dump.

On February 2, 1966, in his second attempt, Piantanida launched in ''Strato Jump II'' from [[Sioux Falls Regional Airport|Joe Foss Field]] near [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]], and reached an unprecedented altitude of {{convert|123,500|ft|m}}. From that height he had planned to parachute from the balloon to set a world record for the highest parachute jump, but was unable to disconnect himself from his oxygen line. He aborted the jump and detached the gondola from the balloon, returning to earth in the gondola without the balloon. Because he did not return to earth with his balloon, his unprecedented altitude is not recognized by the ''[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]]'' as a balloon altitude world record, and because he did not jump from the balloon's gondola at 123,500 feet, he earned no parachute altitude record.

On the morning of May 1, 1966, Piantanida donned a bright orange [[pressure suit|suit]] and parachute harness. Secured inside a [[styrofoam]]-insulated gondola about the size of a portable toilet,&lt;ref name=NJ.com/&gt; he began his ascent for a planned super-sonic free fall from over 120,000 feet. However, ground controllers listening to the communications link with the ''Strato Jump III'' were startled by the sound of a whoosh of rushing air and a sudden, cut-off call over the radio to abort. Piantanida's suit had [[uncontrolled decompression|depressurized]] at about the 57,000-foot mark.&lt;ref name=Magnificent/&gt; Ground controllers immediately jettisoned the balloon at close to {{convert|56000|ft|m}} – higher than the cruising altitude for commercial jets – and for 25 minutes Piantanida's gondola parachuted to the ground. He barely survived the descent, having suffered massive tissue damage due to [[ebullism]].&lt;ref name=Betancourt/&gt; The lack of oxygen left him [[brain damage]]d and in a [[coma]] from which he never recovered. Piantanida died four months later at the Veterans Hospital in Philadelphia, on August 29.&lt;ref name=Pre-Astronauts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nicholas Piantanida, Parachutist In Coma for 4 Months, Dies at 33|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/08/30/archives/nicholas-piantanida-parachutist-in-coma-for-4-months-dies-at-33.html|accessdate=October 21, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 29, 1966}} This headline mistakenly says Piantanida was 33 years old.&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in North Arlington, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nicholas John Piantanida |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/17430617/nicholas-john-piantanida |website=Find A Grave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gondola of the ''Strato Jump III'' is preserved and displayed in the Boeing Aviation Hangar at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] [[National Air and Space Museum]]'s [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] in [[Chantilly, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gondola, Strato-Jump III|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19740008000|work=[[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] [[National Air and Space Museum]]|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Piantanida was [[Roman Catholic]]. He married Janice McDowell in 1963,&lt;ref name=Pre-Astronauts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; and they had three daughters: Donna, Diane, and Debbie.&lt;ref name=NJ.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=Manliness/&gt;

A film based on his life, entitled ''Angry Sky'', premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 22, 2015, and on ESPN as part of the ''[[30 for 30]]'' series on July 30, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/angry-sky-2015|title=Angry Sky - Tribeca Film Festival|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=angrysky|title=Angry Sky - ESPN Films: 30 for 30|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Olexandr Olexandrovych Kolchenko''' ({{lang-uk|Олександр Олександрович Кольченко}}, {{lang-ru|Александр Александрович Кольченко}}, nicknamed "Tundra", born November 26, 1989) is a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] and [[trade union]] activist, [[Antifascism|antifascist]], [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[Environmental movement|ecologist]], [[archaeologist]], who has been convicted of terrorism by the Russian occupation administration of Crimea in 2014.

Olexandr Kolchenko and three more Crimean pro-Ukrainian activists: Olexiy Chyrniy, Gennadiy Afanasyev and [[Oleg Sentsov]] are united by a common criminal case of the so-called "Crimean terrorists". All four have been arrested and imprisoned in Russia after the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]].

== Activism ==
Born in a working-class family, Olexandr Kolchenko worked as a loader at the post while studying tourism management at the geographic faculty of [[Tavrida National University]] in Simferopol. He became a supporter of anarchist, antifascist and internationalist ideas. Since 2007, Kolchenko has been an active militant of the local antifascist movement. He staged numerous street protests against manifestations of fascism in the region, and participated in clashes with both Ukrainian and pro-Russian [[far right]]. He also organized actions of solidarity with Russian antifascists who fell victims of the neo-Nazi terror or government repression, including [[Anastasia Baburova]] and [[Ivan Khutorskoy]].

From 2010 to 2013, Kolchenko was an active member of the independent trade union "Student Action" composed of socialists and anarchists advocating free education, student rights, and autonomy of universities. He was involved to numerous events and public campaigns to protect workers' rights and the environment. He was supporting the struggles of [[Crimean Trolleybus]] employees and protesting against construction of a contaminant port in Crimea.

== Persecution and arrest ==
Olexandr Kolchenko was detained on May 16, 2014 in [[Simferopol]], [[Crimea]], [[Ukraine]]. He was convicted of arson of the offices of Russian political organizations and planning the bombing of the Soviet Memorial monument in [[Crimea]]. On May 23, 2014 Olexandr was convoyed to [[Moscow]] and imprisoned in the [[Lefortovo Prison|Lefortovo]] prison.

Despite his left-wing and antifascist affiliations, he has been accused of belonging to the Ukrainian ultranationalist organization [[Right Sector]] and of plotting terrorist attacks.

In June 2015 the investigation of the Kolchenko and [[Sentsov]] criminal case was finished and the case went to trial. On July 31, 2015 the [[Rostov-on-Don]] military court started hearings on this case.&lt;ref name="litoy11"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Litoy|first1=Alexandr|title=The Crimean Terrorists|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/alexandr-litoy/crimean-%E2%80%98terrorists%E2%80%99|website=Open Democracy|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Olexandr Kolchenko stood trial together with [[Oleg Sentsov]].

The accusation against Kolchenko and [[Sentsov]] is primarily based on evidence given by two other so-calles "Crimean terrorists", Chyrniy and Afanasyev, broadcast on Russian television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=В Крыму обезврежены диверсанты "Правого Сектора", которые собирались устроить теракты на День Победы|url=http://www.1tv.ru/news/crime/259988|website=Первый Канал|accessdate=19 August 2015|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; But they refused to testify in court. Afanasyev announced that his testimonies had been given under torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Prosecution Witness Against Ukrainian Filmmaker Sentsov Withdrew His Testimony|url=http://en.censor.net.ua/news/345991/key_prosecution_witness_against_ukrainian_filmmaker_sentsov_withdrew_his_testimony|website=Cenzor.net|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defence==

'''Olexandr Kolchenko''' rejects all charges of [[terrorism]]. Kolchenko fully admits to hurling a [[Molotov cocktail]] at a building housing pro-Russian organizations (namely [[United Russia]] ruling party, formerly Crimean [[Party of Regions]], and Russian Community of Crimea NGO), but denies that this was [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coynash|first1=Halya|title=Sentsov-Kolchenko Trial&lt;Crimea And What Russia Has To Hide|url=http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1436491551|website=Human Rights In Ukraine|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was committed at night when the participants understood the office to be empty and there was no intention to put anybody's life in danger. According to the human rights organization [[Memorial]], similar attacks on party offices in Russia to this date have been punished as arson or "hooliganism" and not as terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memo.ru/d/244621.html ''The Memorial Human Rights Centre considers Oleg Sentsov, Alexander Kolchenko and Gennady Afanasyev political prisoners'']. Memorial, August 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Kolchenko and his lawyer, Svetlana Sidorkina, are adamant that the only real charge against Kolchenko can be classified as [[hooliganism]] or [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coynash|first1=Halya|title=Sentsov &amp; Kolchenko Face 20-year Sentences For Non-Existent Terrorism|url=http://ukrainesolidaritycampaign.org/2015/07/24/sentsov-kolchenko-face-20-year-sentences-for-non-existent-terrorism/|website=Ukraine Solidarity Campaign|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolchenko also refuted belonging to the political party [[Right Sector]] which is banned in [[Russia]]. [[Right Sector]] itself has released a press statement stating that the four individuals considered by Russia as "Crimean terrorists" have nothing to do with the party.&lt;ref name="litoy11" /&gt;

Russian authorities denied [[Sentsov]] and Kolchenko Ukrainian consular assistance, claiming that they were Russian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;″Ukrainians Illegally Detained in Russia″.http://mfa.gov.ua/en/page/open/id/4177.''Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|annexation of Crimea]], Kolchenko and [[Sentsov]] had not signed the document stating that they did not wish to change citizenship. In other words, these accused men have been ″united with Russia″ along with the Crimean peninsula".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Litoy|first1=Alexandr|title=The Crimean Terrorists|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/alexandr-litoy/crimean-%E2%80%98terrorists%E2%80%99|website=Open Democracy|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the State Migration Service of Ukraine confirmed Kolchenko's Ukrainian citizenship and the Kyiv Prosecutor's Office opened a case regarding the abduction of a Ukrainian citizen Olexandr Kolchenko.

According to his lawyer, Svetlana Sidorkina, Kolchenko was illegally issued with a Russian passport, dated May 26, 2014, when he was already in detention.&lt;ref&gt;Coynash, Halya.″Imprisoned Crimean Activist takes Russia to Strasbourg Over Forced Citizetship″.http://khpg.org/index.php?id=1428583933.

== Support and reactions ==

The highly politicized trial of [[Sentsov]] and Kolchenko has resonated not only in [[Ukraine]] but also worldwide. Many prominent world organizations advocating human rights and democratic movement such as [[OSCE]],&lt;ref name="oscepa.org"&gt;″OSCE Parliamentary Assembly adopts resolution condemning Russia's continuing actions in Ukraine″.http://www.oscepa.org/news-a-media/press-releases/2273-osce-parliamentary-assembly-adopts-resolution-condemning-russia-s-actions-in-ukraine.

Kolchenko's name was mentioned in an [[OSCE Parliamentary Assembly|OSCE PA]] resolution condemning [[Russia]]'s continuing actions in [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014)|Ukraine]].

''Ukraine solidarity campaign солідарність України кампанія'' .&lt;/ref&gt; The information about how to support Olexandr Kolchenko is available in German, Italian, French and Spanish.
The social media campaign uses the [[hashtag]] ''#freeKolchenko''.

=== Political aspect ===

The [[Memorial Human Rights Center]] and [[Amnesty International]] have recognized Olexandr Kolchenko as a [[political prisoner]].
He was open about his opposition to the occupation of [[Crimea]] by [[Russia]], prompting a fierce reaction from the Russian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Halya Coynash.″Sentsov and Kolchenko declared Crimean Prisoners as Rot Exposed in Russia′s Crimean ″Terrorist″ Trial″.http://khpg.org/index.php?id=1438647288.

'''Wahibre Psamtik I''', known by the Greeks as '''Psammeticus''' or '''Psammetichus''' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinization]] of {{lang-grc|Ψαμμήτιχος|translit=Psammḗtikhos}}), who ruled 664–610&amp;nbsp;BC, was the first of three kings of that name of the [[Sais, Egypt|Saite]], or [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt]]. Historical references for what the Greeks referred to as the Dodecarchy, a loose confederation of twelve Egyptian territories, based on the traditional [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]], and the rise of Psamtik I in power, establishing the Saitic Dynasty, are recorded in [[Herodotus]]'s ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', Book II: 151–157. From [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts, it was discovered that twenty local princelings were appointed by [[Esarhaddon]] and confirmed by [[Ashurbanipal]] to govern Egypt.

[[Necho I]], the father of Psamtik by his queen Istemabet, was the chief of these kinglets, but they seem to have been quite unable to lead the [[Egyptians]] under the hated [[Assyria]]ns against the more sympathetic [[Nubia]]ns. The [[labyrinth]] built by [[Amenemhat III]] of the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt]] is ascribed by Herodotus to the Dodecarchy, which must represent this combination of rulers.

Necho I died in 664 BC when the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushite]] king [[Tantamani]] tried unsuccessfully to seize control of lower Egypt from the Assyrian Empire. After his father's death, Psamtik both united all of Egypt and freed it from Assyrian control within the first ten years of his reign.

== Military campaigns ==
[[File:Statue of Psamtik.jpg|7th century statue found in [[Kale, Denizli|Kale]] mentioning Psamtik. The [[Ionian Greek]] inscription reads, "Amphimeos' son Pedon brought me from Egypt and gave as a votive; Psammetichos, the king of Egypt gave him a city for his virtue and a golden diadem for his virtue."|thumb]]
Psamtik reunified Egypt in his ninth regnal year when he dispatched a powerful naval fleet in March 656 BC to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and compelled the existing [[God's Wife of Amun]] at Thebes, [[Shepenupet II]], to adopt his daughter [[Nitocris I (Divine Adoratrice)|Nitocris I]] as her heiress in the so-called [[Nitocris I (Divine Adoratrice)#The Adoption Stela|Adoption Stela]]. Psamtik's victory destroyed the last vestiges of the [[Nubia]]n [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]]'s control over [[Upper Egypt]] under Tantamani since Thebes now accepted his authority. Nitocris would hold her office for 70 years from 656 BC until her death in 585 BC. Thereafter, Psamtik campaigned vigorously against those local princes who opposed his reunification of Egypt. One of his victories over certain Libyan marauders is mentioned in a Year 10 and Year 11 stela from the [[Dakhla Oasis]]. Psamtik won Egypt's independence from the Assyrian Empire and restored Egypt's prosperity during his 54-year reign. The pharaoh proceeded to establish close relations with [[archaic Greece]] and also encouraged many Greek settlers to establish colonies in Egypt and serve in the Egyptian army. In particular, he settled some Greeks at [[Tahpanhes]] (Daphnae).

== Discovering the origin of language ==
[[Image:PsamtikIWallSection-BritishMuseum-August19-08.jpg|thumb|Basalt wall depicting Psamtik&amp;nbsp;I ([[British Museum]])]]

The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] conveyed an anecdote about Psamtik in the second volume of his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' (2.2). During his travel to Egypt, Herodotus heard that Psammetichus ("Psamṯik") sought to [[Language deprivation experiments|discover the origin of language by conducting an experiment]] with two children. Allegedly he gave two newborn babies to a shepherd, with the instructions that no one should speak to them, but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. The hypothesis was that the first word would be uttered in the root language of all people. When one of the children cried "βεκός" (bekós) with outstretched arms, the shepherd concluded that the word was [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] because that was the sound of the Phrygian word for "bread". Thus, they concluded that the [[Phrygians]] were an older people than the Egyptians, and that Phrygian was the original language of men. There are no other extant sources to verify this story.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter-url=http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.2.ii.html|author=[[Herodotus]]|title=Histories|publisher=Internet Classics Archive|accessdate=18 March 2017|chapter=2.2.3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wives ==
Psamtik's chief wife was [[Mehytenweskhet]], the daughter of Harsiese, the [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] of the North and High Priest of [[Atum]] at Heliopolis. Psamtik and Mehytenweskhet were the parents of [[Necho&amp;nbsp;II]], Merneith, and the Divine Adoratrice [[Nitocris I (Divine Adoratrice)|Nitocris&amp;nbsp;I]].{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}

Psamtik's father-in-law—the aforementioned Harsiese—was married three times: to Sheta, with whom he had a daughter named Naneferheres, to Tanini and, finally, to an unknown woman, by whom he had both Djedkare, the vizier of the South and Mehytenweskhet.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Référence:Nos ancêtres de l'Antiquité (Christian Settipani)|Nos ancêtres de l'Antiquité]], 1991, [[Christian Settipani]], pp. 153, 160 &amp; 161&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=March 2017}} Harsiese was the son of vizier Harkhebi, and was related to two other Harsieses, both viziers, who were a part of the family of the famous Mayor of [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]] [[Montuemhat]].{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}

== Statue discovery ==
[[File:Statue of Egyptian King Psamtik I excavation 1.jpg|thumb|left|The statue's torso]]
On 9 March 2017, Egyptian and German archaeologists discovered a colossal statue about {{convert|26|ft|m|order=flip}} in height at the [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] site in [[Cairo]]. Made of [[quartzite]], the statue was found in a fragmentary state, with the bust, the lower part of the head and the crown submerged in groundwater.&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/03/egypt-pharaoh-ramses-statue-discovered-cairo/ |title=Massive Statue of Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Found in City Slum|publisher=National Geographic| date=10 March 2017| accessdate =12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has now been confirmed to be of Psamtik I due to engravings found that mentioned one of the pharaoh's names on the base of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/world/middleeast/egypt-cairo-pharaoh-statue-ramses-psamtik.html |title=So Many Pharaohs: A Possible Case of Mistaken Identity in Cairo |first=Nour|last=Youssef|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 March 2017|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson |first=Ben |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2017/0318/Two-pharaohs-one-statue-A-tale-of-mistaken-identity |title=Two pharaohs, one statue: A tale of mistaken identity? |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=18 March 2017 |accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39298218 |title=Egypt Pharaoh statue 'not Ramses II but different ruler' |publisher=BBC News |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-17/egypt-pharaoh-statue-not-ramses-ii/8362992 |title=Inscription reveals colossus unearthed in Cairo slum not of Ramses II, more likely Pharaoh Psamtek I |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bel Trew|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/statue-found-in-cairo-may-be-biggest-ever-from-the-late-period-wwdv72hfb |title=Statue found in Cairo may be biggest ever from the Late Period |publisher=The Times |date=17 March 2017 |accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesperson at the time commented that "If it does belong to this king, then it is the largest statue of the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] that was ever discovered in Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39298218  | title = Egypt Pharaoh statue 'not Ramses II but different ruler | date = 16 March 2017 | publisher = BBC News | access-date = 16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/recently-discovered-egyptian-statue-is-not-ramses-ii-1.3328018|title=Recently discovered Egyptian statue is not Ramses II|last=Hendawi|first=Hamza|work=CTVNews|access-date=17 March 2017|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head and torso are expected to be moved to the [[Grand Egyptian Museum]].&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;

The statue/colossus was sculpted in the ancient classical style of 2000 BC, establishing a resurgence to the greatness and prosperity of the classical period of old. However, from the many gathered fragments (now 6,400 of them) of quartzite collected, it has also been established that the colossus was at sometime deliberately destroyed. Certain discoloured &amp; cracked rock fragments show evidence of having been heated to high temperatures then shattered (with cold water), a pretty typical way of destroying ancient colossi.

'''Rainer Eppelmann''' ({{audio|Rainer Eppelmann.ogg|German pronunciation}}) (born 12 February 1943 in [[Berlin]]), is a [[Germany|German]] politician. Known for his opposition in the [[German Democratic Republic]], he became Minister for Disarmament and Defense in the last cabinet. He is now a member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]].

The erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] forced him to drop out of the school he had attended in [[West Berlin]] in 1961 and he was forbidden from taking his Abitur exams in the East for refusing to join the [[Free German Youth]] movement. He then worked as an assistant to a roofer before doing a job training for bricklayer. He is a pacifist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddr89.de/ddr89/personen/eppelmann.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, for refusing both regular service and ''[[Bausoldat]]'' (construction soldier in the [[National People's Army]]), he was put into prison for eight months.

Later, he studied [[Theology]] at the theological school in [[Berlin]], an education he completed in 1974 with two exams. He then worked as a [[Lutheran]] pastor in [[Friedrichshain|Berlin-Friedrichshain]] and took part in the opposition, such as being the  editor of [[samizdat|samizdat publications]] with [[Thomas Welz]]. It has been claimed that during this period Eppelmann had contact with the [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasnost.de/autoren/behrend/buergerbew.html Paragraph 6 of "DDR-Opposition bis 1989"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vorwaerts.ch/vorwaerts/1997/23hintergrund.html Middle of "Ein Blick zurück"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206012126/http://www.vorwaerts.ch/vorwaerts/1997/23hintergrund.html |date=2006-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Eppelmann was one of the founding fathers of the [[Democratic Awakening]], becoming its president. Thus, he took an active part in the round table of 1990, preparing the [[German reunification]]. From 18 March 1990 to 2 October 1990 (when it ceased to exist) he was a member of the [[Volkskammer]]. He became a Minister in the cabinet of [[Hans Modrow]] and later in the one of [[Lothar de Maizière]]. When the [[Democratic Awakening]] joined the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union ]] in August 1990, Eppelmann became a member and, later, the assisting chairman of the worker's division of the CDU, the CDA.

He was a member of the [[Bundestag]] from [[German federal election, 1990|1990]] to [[German federal election, 2005|2005]] for the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]. Then, he was chairman of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Germany)|commission]] that coped with the history of the [[German Democratic Republic]].

Eppelmann's trademark is his "Berliner Schnauze", an [[idiom]] that is supposed to bring him close to the people of [[Berlin]].

He is married and has five children.

[[File:Guillermo Divito.JPG|thumb|[[Guillermo J. Divito]], founder, editor and contributor to the magazine]]
'''''Rico Tipo''''' was a weekly [[Argentine]] comic magazine that appeared from late 1944 until 1972, founded and directed by [[Guillermo Divito]]. It was among the main [[Argentine comics|comic magazines in Argentina]], others being ''[[Patoruzú]]'' (launched in 1936) and ''[[Satiricón]]'' (founded in 1972). Rico Tipo was much more successful, adapting to changing tastes through a period of 36 years.

==Origins==

José Antonio Guillermo Divito joined the stable of artists at the Patoruzú weekly as a young man, where he began drawing his first illustrations of ''Chicas'' (Girls). The magazine's director, Dante Quinterno, disapproved of the great sensuality of the ''Chicas'', and suggested tweaks and longer skirts. Tired of this interference, and unable to get a raise of pay, Divito decided to create his own magazine Rico Tipo, which was launched on 16 November 1944. By the next year it had a weekly print run of around 350,000 copies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Contents and contributors==

In addition to the ''Chicas'', Divito included in Rico Tipo a whole series of characters that portrayed aspects recognizable to the average citizen: Pochita Morfoni, an obese woman who only thinks about food; Fulmine, an ugly man dressed in black who brings bad luck and misfortune; Fallutelli, prototype sycophantic employee and traitor to his fellows; Bombolo, a fat good-natured and naive man who cannot understand figurative speech and always take things literally; Gracielita, a very modern, waspish girl.
The most important character was Dr. Merengue, whom [[Pablo de Santis]] in his book ''Rico Tipo y las Chicas de Divito'' called "a sort of criollo [[Mr. Hyde]]".
Dr Merengue behaved as required by the more conservative social conventions: serious, formal, fair, accurate and dispassionate, never losing his composure. But in the last square of the strip, his alter ego revealed his true feelings or thoughts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Besides Divito, Rico Tipo included the cream of Argentine humorous writing and graphics at the time, and trained future generations of writers and artists who took their first steps at the magazine.
These included [[Oscar Conti]] ("Oski"), Alejandro del Prado ("Cale"), Rodolfo M. Taboada, Horacio S. Meyrialle, [[Miguel Angel Bavio Esquiú]], Abel Ianiro, [[Joaquín Lavado]] ("Quino"), Tomás Elvino Blanco, [[Rafael Martínez (humorist)|Rafael Martínez]], [[Guillermo Guerrero]] and many others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
[[Adolfo Mazzone]]'s character [[Piantadino]] appeared in the magazine.&lt;ref name="todohistorietas.com.ar"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todohistorietas.com.ar/otrospersonajes2.htm|title=Mas Personajes de la Historieta Argentinua|work=todohistorietas.com.ar|language=Spanish|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peak of popularity==

Rico Tipo had two decades of glory, the 1940s and 1950s, during which the magazine had huge popular acceptance.
The adult population enjoyed the drawing, characters and humor in which passions and sensuality were not entirely absent.
The ''[[Chicas de Divito]]'' (Divito Girls), especially, distinguished the magazine from its rivals.
The magazine was so successful and popular that it influenced fashion in [[Buenos Aires]] at the time.
Women wanted to look like the Divito Girls who often appeared on the covers of the magazine.
Men admired that style of woman, and also adopted the costumes of the Divito's male characters, with double-breasted suits with long jackets and many buttons.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Decline and disappearance==

The emergence of a more liberal attitude to sexuality in the late sixties began to weaken the influence of the magazine.
Political events in the country also affected the magazine.
Survival of the publication by the end of the sixties depended on Divito's changing his style.
Divito, who died in 1969, never saw the demise of the magazine, which came three years later, nor a change in style that probably he would not have liked.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

'''''Sad Satan''''' is a [[PC game]] built with the ''Terror Engine'',&lt;ref name="dot" /&gt; first reported on the [[YouTube]] channel ''Obscure Horror Corner'' on June 15, 2015.&lt;ref name=buzz&gt;{{cite news|title=There’s A Game That’s Surfaced From The Deep Web And It’s  Scary As Hell|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfstaff/sleep-tight-ghost-babies#.dd8pmpa5K|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following initial reviews, the channel's video of the game was picked by a number of English-language publications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Sad Satan the scariest video game ever?

==Title==
The title is a reference to the [[Led Zeppelin]] song "[[Stairway to Heaven]]." Allegedly, when [[Backmasking|the song is played backwards]], disturbing and Satanic lyrics can be heard. One of the lines from the supposedly backmasked lyrics is "There was a little tool shed where he made us suffer, sad Satan."

== History ==
In an interview with ''[[Kotaku]]'', the channel's owner claims to have downloaded the game from a [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] [[hidden service]] after receiving a tip from an anonymous subscriber. The subscriber in turn claims to have found the link via a [[Dark web|deep web]] internet forum, from a user only known as "ZK".&lt;ref name=PatriciaHernandez&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernandez|first1=Patricia|title=A Horror Game That May Be Hidden In The Darkest Corners Of The Internet [UPDATE]|url=http://kotaku.com/a-horror-game-hidden-in-the-darkest-corners-of-the-inte-1714980337|accessdate=22 November 2015|date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, some followers were skeptical of the game, fearing it may contain gore or child pornography (as both are common staples of media traded throughout the deep web). However, the owner of ''Obscure Horror Corner'' shared that, so far in his playthroughs, the game had not contained any such material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Owner of Obscure Horror Corner claims Sad Satan game does not have gore or child porn in it...|url=http://oi59.tinypic.com/14marzk.jpg|accessdate=1 December 2015|date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|date=January 2017}}

Following the ''Kotaku'' interview, the [[Reddit#Subreddits|subreddit]] "/r/sadsatan" was formed on the website [[Reddit]] to discuss the game, quickly realising the [[.onion]] address provided by ''Obscure Horror Corner'' contained [[.onion#Format|invalid]] characters. 3 days later, another interview with the ''Obscure Horror Corner'' owner appeared on Kotaku, claiming that the link was purposefully given in error since the game itself did in fact contain such graphic material and the ''Obscure Horror Corner'' channel owner did not want to be responsible for disseminating such material. In an update to the ''Kotaku'' article, Patricia Hernandez states:

{{blockquote|I should have presented the tale of its discovery with more skepticism. I apologize for that. While the original article admits that the game exists in a more mythical state than a tangible one, it could have gone farther to make clear what was concrete about Jamie's tale and what wasn't.&lt;ref name=PatriciaHernandez/&gt;}}

Minutes before the update, a new version of the game was posted to [[4chan]] by someone claiming to be ZK, claiming that ''Obscure Horror Corner'' had not been showing their viewers the "true" Sad Satan.&lt;ref name="dot2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Archive of 4chan's /x/ post|url=https://archive.4plebs.org/x/thread/16336021/|accessdate=2 December 2015|date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|date=January 2017}} Members of the 4chan community downloaded this version of the game and attempted to play it. Some users complained that their computers began running sluggishly, and a few even reported that their computers became completely unresponsive while trying to run the game. A few users even reported that their computer would not turn on anymore after running this version of the game.&lt;ref name="dot2" /&gt;{{Unreliable source|date=January 2017}} One Reddit user attempted to play the game from a [[Live USB]] instead of their computer's main hard drive. Later, when they tried to boot into their computer as normal, the computer failed to load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Took down the sad satan DL link...|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/sadsatan/comments/3coz8d/took_down_the_sad_satan_dl_link_as_it_fucked_over/|accessdate=1 December 2015|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|date=January 2017}} This version, dubbed the "clone" by most of the /r/sadsatan community, contained images of violent gore and some child pornography, some of which was accessible right from the Title Screen of the game. A version of the game with the pornography removed, often called the "clean" version was created by Redditors and subsequently redistributed in hopes that people who went out to download the game would download it instead of the "clone", which contained the graphic imagery.

=== Speculation ===

Sad Satan was the last game covered by ''Obscure Horror Corner'', and since then, the YouTube channel was abandoned for unknown reasons. There has been speculation that the game was in fact created by the owner of the ''Obscure Horror Corner'' in an effort to increase viewer subscription count, and that the Deep Web story was a complete fabrication to give the whole account more intrigue.

This is an obvious concern since the content is in fact illegal.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Speculation over who created which versions|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/sadsatan/comments/3ch9sq/guys_theres_so_much_proof_that_obscure_horror/csvija3|accessdate=1 December 2015|date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|date=January 2017}}

It is also possible that Sad Satan was not created by the owner of ''Obscure Horror Corner'', and that in truth, the owner of the channel decided to go into hiding because of all the controversy after the malware version of Sad Satan was released. 

== Content ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
The original game posted by ''Obscure Horror Corner'' features walking down [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] corridors while various audio samples are played and looped over each other. Audio in the game leans heavily on recordings of interviews with various murderers, such as [[Charles Manson]]. The game also depends heavily on [[backmasking|distorted or reversed]] audio of such interviews or musical clips, such as "Wo Ai Beijing Tiananmen", played in the beginning. Reversed clips from the [[Swedish Rhapsody (Numbers station)|Swedish Rhapsody]] [[numbers station]] can also be heard. While the player controls their character through the hallways, images may intermittently display, taking up the entire screen and preventing the player from progressing any further until the image automatically closes a few seconds later. Most of the images seem to reference [[child abuse]], especially people indicted in [[Operation Yewtree]], such as images of [[Jimmy Savile]] and [[Rolf Harris]]. Other images revolve around crime, and include people convicted or accused of murder, such as Japanese murderer [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]], photographs of [[Lady Justice]] statues, and political figures such as former UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Images of accident victims and murder victims are also shown, including the aftermath of a person struck by a truck, and a [[beheading]]. The only other "characters" in the game are children who simply stand in one place and do not move or interact with the player at all. In the final video posted by ''Obscure Horror Corner'', one of these children does begin to follow the player, causing "contact damage". Since the player has no means of self-defense or any ability to heal damage, the player will inevitably die at this point in the game.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12946">[[File:SYANALogo.png|thumb|right|Logo of the Sikh Youth Alliance of North America, which organizes the symposium]]
The '''Sikh Youth Symposium''' is an annual [[Public Speaking|public speaking]] and [[debate]] competition held for the [[Sikh]] youth across the United States of America and Canada, encouraging them to reconnect with their cultural foundations and religious roots. Organized by the Sikh Youth Alliance of North America (SYANA), the competition is open to children between the ages of 6 and 22 and has three levels--locals, regionals, and internationals. The children are divided into five groups, on the basis of age, with the first four groups competing by way of prepared speeches and the final group engaging in a stimulating discussion focused on a yearly chosen topic. The competition aims to ensure that the next generation of Sikh leaders remains firmly connected to the basic principles of its [[religion]].

==Format==
The competition is divided into five age groups: Group I (6-8 years old), Group II (9-10 years old), Group III (11-13 years old), Group IV (14-17 years old, and Group V (16-22 years old). Each age group is assigned a different book on the Sikh religion each year by a committee of regional and international conveners. This committee also generates a list of three questions for each age group that are to be answered in the participants' speeches. The answers to these questions can be found, in large part, in the book assigned; however, some reflection and critical thinking by the participants is necessary in answering the questions, as well. 

The local level of the competition is usually held within a [[gurdwara]]. The winners in each group of the competition advance to the regional level, which usually involves four to five gurdwaras in close geographical proximity. The winners in each group of this competition advance to the international level, which is hosted in a different city across the United States of America and Canada every year.
[[File:GroupFivePicture2010.jpg|thumb|right|Group V competitors at the 2010 International Sikh Youth Symposium in Toronto, Ontario]]
At the local, regional, and international level for groups I - IV, the competition is held in the form of a prepared [[speech]]. Group I's allotted time is 5 minutes, Group II's allotted time is 6 minutes, Group III's allotted time is 6 minutes, and Group IV's allotted time is 7 minutes. A panel of three judges assesses the speeches, weighing 60% of a participant's score on his/her content (answering the questions) and the remaining 40% on the participant's presentation (style and delivery, eye contact, voice and diction, language, and overall effectiveness). For Group V, the local and regional competition is usually a prepared speech, graded in the same manner as groups I-IV. However, the international competition for Group V is a debate between the winners from each region. The debate consists of four phases--opening statements, questions from the [[Discussion moderator|moderator]], closing statements, and questions from the [[Sangat (term)|sangat]]--and typically lasts three hours. 

Whereas the local and regional competition are completed in a day in April/May, the international competition spans the entire first weekend of August. Finalists and their families arrive in the host city on a Thursday, checking in that evening and receiving their informational packets for the weekend. Also on Thursday evening, the regional and international conveners meet to decide on the books and international host city for the next year. On Friday morning, the competition for Group I, Group II, and Group III is typically held before langar and Group IV's competition is held after langar. On Friday evening, participants and their families enjoy a social activity, ranging from a tour of the city and its notable landmarks to a fun activity, such as bowling or attending a rodeo. On Saturday, the marquee event of the Symposium--the Group V debate--is held throughout the morning and early afternoon. In the evening, participants and their families enjoy a formal banquet to honor the Symposium's participants. On Sunday morning, the awards ceremony is held and, after langar, the Symposium is officially complete.

{{Nihongo|'''''The Bells of Nagasaki'''''|長崎の鐘|Nagasaki no Kane}} is a 1949 [[book]] by [[Takashi Nagai]]. It vividly describes his experiences as a survivor of the [[atomic bombing of Nagasaki]]. It was translated into English by William Johnston. The title refers to the bells of [[Urakami Cathedral]], of which Nagai writes:

''These are the bells that did not ring for weeks or months after the disaster. May there never be a time when they do not ring! May they ring out this message of [[peace]] until the morning of the day on which the world ends.''

Initially, the book was refused publication by the [[Occupation of Japan|American forces occupying Japan]], until an appendix was added describing [[Japanese atrocities]] in the [[Philippines]]. This appendix was later removed.

Directors Ian and Dominic Higgins cited ''The Bells of Nagasaki'' (the book) as one of the main inspirations for making the film. The film is titled ''[[All That Remains (film)|All That Remains]]'' and was released in 2016. It is the first Western film to deal directly with the atomic bombing of Nagasaki.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2629110/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Soap Myth''''' is a play by American playwright [[Jeff Cohen (playwright and theater director)|Jeff Cohen]]. Information about the play can be found at http://www.burkecohenent.com/439032480.

The play had a workshop run in July 2009 at the ''Dog Run Repertory Company,'' and a rewritten version had an [[Off-Broadway]] run in the Spring of 2012 Off Broadway at The Roundabout Theater's Harold and Mimi Steinberg Theatre Center. That production was filmed and the film was broadcast nationally on PBS and can be viewed at digitaltheatre.com.  The cast was Greg Mullavey, Andi Potamkin, Dee Pelletier and Donald Corren under the direction of Arnold Mittlelman.

On May 2, 2016, ''The Soap Myth'' was presented as a reading at the Bruno Walter Auditorium at the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts.  The reading, directed by Pam Berlin, starred legendary 7-time Emmy Award winning actor Ed Asner and 2-time Tony Award nominee Jayne Atkinson.  The cast also included Blair Baker and Donald Corren.  The reading, produced by Burke-Cohen Entertainment, was the flagship event of Remembrance Readings, a national program in honor of Holocaust Memorial Day presented by the National Jewish Theater Foundation.

During the week of February 21, 2017, "The Soap Myth" had 5 West Coast readings: @ Marin Academy and Marin Theater Company (San Francisco), @ Shomrei Torah Synagogue in West Hills (LA), University Synagogue in Irvine and at Center Theatre Group's Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City (LA).  The cast was Ed Asner, 4-time Tony Award nominee, 2-time Drama Desk Award winner and 2-time Emmy Award nominee Tovah Feldshuh, Blair Baker and Donald Corren under the direction of Pam Berlin.

From January 22 to February 1, 2018, ''The Soap Myth'' enjoyed a brief tour starring Ed Asner as Holocaust survivor Milton Saltzman and two time Tony Award nominee Johanna Day in the dual roles of Holocaust scholar Esther Feinman and Holocaust denier Brenda Goodsen.  Blair Baker again played Annie Blumberg and Ned Eisenberg played the roles that had previously been played by Donald Corren.  The play was again directed by Pam Berlin.  The largely sold-out performances were at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami Beach, FL, the Adolph and Rose Levis Jewish Community Center in Boca Raton, FL, the Parker Playhouse in Fort Lauderdale, FL, the Zeiterion Theater Performing Arts Center in New Bedford, MA, Congregation Rodeph Shalom in Philadelphia, PA, The Museum of Jewish Heritage in Battery Park City, New York City, and Hofstra University in Hempstead, Long Island, NY.

==Description==
''The Soap Myth'' dramatizes the powerful confrontation between survivor memory and historical memory and depicts the insidiousness of Holocaust denial. More than a half century after World War II, at the desperate urging of a passionate survivor, a young investigative reporter finds herself caught between numerous versions of the same story and trying to separate fact from fiction. Did the Nazis make soap from the corpses of their murdered Jewish victims? Played out against the backdrop of deadline reporting and journalistic integrity, Jeff Cohen's critically acclaimed play The Soap Myth uses this horrific possibility as its catalyst. It questions who deserves the right to write history — those who have lived it and remember, those studying and protecting it, or those seeking to distort its very existence? And finally, what responsibility should others take once they know the truth?

Although ''The Soap Myth'' is a work of fiction, it is, in the words of the program, "inspired by real people and real events as well as an article written by Josh Rolnick in [[Moment (magazine)|''Moment'']] magazine profiling [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor Morris Spitzer."&lt;ref name=prog&gt;Program, Dog Run Rep, South Street Seaport&lt;/ref&gt;

Foremost among the play's historical inspirations is the evidence that the Nazi regime had a program at the Danzig Anatomic Institute in 1944 to develop a process for the mass-production of soap from the fat of Jews being slaughtered in Nazi extermination camps, and produced soap in small quantities at a nearby concentration camp. In a dramatic moment, the players re-enact testimony from the [[Nuremberg Trials]], including this recipe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;5 kilos of human fat are mixed with 10 liters of water and 500 or 1,000 grams of caustic soda. All this is boiled 2 or 3 hours and then cooled. The soap floats to the surface while the water and other sediment remain at the bottom. A bit of salt and soda is added to this mixture. Then fresh water is added and the mixture again boiled 2 or 3 hours. After having cooled, the soap is poured into molds."&lt;ref name=villager&gt;{{cite news |title=Some still deny the Holocaust, some simply refuse to listen |author=Jerry Tallmer |url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_323/somestilldeny.html |newspaper=The Villager |location=New York City |date=July 8–14, 2009 |accessdate=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The play's central character, is an elderly [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor called Milton Saltzman, worked doggedly to establish as fact the idea that the Nazis produced and used [[soap made from human corpses]], even handing bars of such soap to Jews on their way into the sealed chambers that functioned alternately as [[gas chamber]]s and as shower rooms in the [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref name=falsewitness&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/arts-and-culture/theater-and-dance/10929/false-witness/ False Witness; A play examines the notion that Nazis made soap from Jewish flesh], MARISSA BROSTOFF, July 21, 2009, ''[[Tablet Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The second character is a young journalist called Annie Blumberg assigned to write a story about Saltzman. She is soon caught between her sympathies for Saltzman and the adamant stand of a number of distinguished scholars of the Holocaust who refuse to publish the Nazi manufacture of soap as fact despite a large amount of eyewitness testimony, including the eyewitness testimony of both Nazis and British prisoners of war at the Nuremberg trial who worked in the experimental soap manufacturing facility at [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] in 1944, because contemporary documentation is lacking. The scholars in the play fear that without proof beyond the eyewitness testimony, the story of the manufacture of soap from human bodies will become ammunition in the hands of [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]].&lt;ref name=villager /&gt;&lt;ref name=falsewitness /&gt;

Two characters representing historians of the Holocaust argue strongly that although a large number of eyewitnesses including former British POWs, Nazis, and Holocaust survivors have testified about the soap production, because no actual laboratory or production records survive as physical documents, any publication about the production of soap will be used by Holocaust deniers to discredit the reality of the Holocaust itself and, therefore, that no assertions that any soap production took place should be published.&lt;ref name=falsewitness/&gt;

A character called Brenda Goodsen, an amalgam of a number of Holocaust deniers including [[David Irving]], appears in the play to demonstrate the evil of anti-Semitism in the form of Holocaust Denial.  This character delivers a speech for minimizing the Holocaust and concluding that the Jews brought it on themselves.

==Historical references==
Holocaust historian [[Robert Melvin Spector]] concludes that the Nazis "did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at [[Stutthof concentration camp|Stutthof]]," albeit in limited quantity.&lt;ref&gt;World without civilization: mass murder and the Holocaust, history and analysis, Robert Melvin Spector, University Press of America, 2004, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

The material in the Nuremberg Trial scenes in the play use as dialogue actual testimony given by British prisoners of war and by Nazis at the historical trials about the development of an industrial process for producing soap from human bodies at the Danzig Anatomic Institute, the production of such soap on a small-scale basis at [[Stutthof concentration camp]], and the actual use of this soap by Nazi personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Justice at Nuremberg, Robert E. Conot, Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, 1984, pp. 298–299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/02-19-46.asp Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 7, SIXTY-SECOND DAY], 19 February 1946, Morning Session&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denying history: who says the Holocaust never happened and why do they say it?

Feig, Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, 1981, pp. 200. ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reception==

The play has gone through two substantially different versions.

The first received a workshop production at [[South Street Seaport]] in July 2009.&lt;ref name="prog" /&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' called the play a "pointed investigation of the politics of history."&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater2.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/theater/reviews/21soap.html Where Political Agendas and History Intersect], New York Times, Jason Zinoman, July 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] New York'' wrote that the play "touches on a host of compelling issues: irrefutable versus empirical evidence, the subjective shaping of history, institutional agendas and, in its most effective scene, the potential seduction of anti-Semitism." But criticized the play's faulty dramaturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/theater/76576/the-soap-myth-at-seaport-theater-review The Soap Myth], Time Out New York&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[NYTheater.com]]'', praised it's "...dazzling objectivity and even-handedness" and "real moral heft..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytheatre.com/nytheatre/showpage.php?t=soap8558 The Soap Myth], Martin Denton · July 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Villager (Manhattan)|The Villager]]'' found it compelling, "There are certain movies, plays, books that one wishes would never end. For me, ''The Soap Myth'' is one of those extraordinary plays."&lt;ref name=villager /&gt;

Following the workshop production, the play was substantially rewritten and subsequently produced in March, 2012 by the National Jewish Theater Foundation Off Broadway at the Roundabout Theater's Harold &amp; Mimi Steinberg Center Black Box Theater.  This production, directed by Arnold Mittelman, featured Greg Mullavey, Andi Potamkin, Donald Corren and Dee Pelletier.  Reviews of this production were uniformly positive.

''[[The New York Times]]'' called the revised play "A revelation... frightening... thought-provoking... genuinely moving."

''[[History News Network]]'' called it "An eye-opening history lesson... gut-wrenching... unforgettable."

''[[The Philadelphia Jewish Voice]]'' said "Continues to haunt me... this is the theatre of witness at its best - provocative and morally ambiguous."

Perhaps most importantly, the play has been championed by Michael Berenbaum, one of the world's foremost Holocaust historians and co-Founder and Project Director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.  Mr. Berenbaum has written "As the scholar specifically named in Jeff Cohen's play "The Soap Myth," I recognize in each of the characters people that I have encountered in my professional career from passionate survivors to stodgy Museum officials, from naïve and innocent reporters to pernicious Holocaust deniers.  The play portrays them all powerfully."

==Film==

A film, directed by Ron Kopp and Mr. Mittelman, was made of the National Jewish Theater production.  That film will be broadcast nationally through American Public Television on PBS stations across the country.  The sponsoring station, WPBT2 in Miami, will air the premiere broadcast on January 27, 2014.  In addition, the film will be the first American offering on Britain's prestigious Digital Theatre website.

Ron Kopp also directed "I Will Refuse to Bubble: History and Theater as Defiance," a documentary about the making of "The Soap Myth" that examines the question of who has the right to write history, highlighting the importance of theater in understanding the world's most incomprehensible events. Featuring Holocaust survivor Irving Roth and scholars Michael Berenbaum, David Marwell and Bonnie Gurewitsch, it also is distributed online by Digital Theatre.

*1–5 September: Thousands of migrants gathered outside [[Budapest Keleti railway station|Keleti railway station]] in the Hungarian capital, [[Budapest]], after police sealed off the terminal to stop them travelling through the EU. The Hungarian government said it was trying to enforce EU law (the [[Dublin Regulation]]), which states that refugees should seek asylum in the first EU country they enter. However, the migrants wanted to claim asylum in Germany. For four days, the migrants camped outside the station and were in a stand-off with police. Eventually, hundreds began walking along the motorway to the Austrian border. The Austrian chancellor said Austria and Germany had agreed to let the migrants cross their borders. The Hungarian government abandoned attempts to register the migrants and sent buses to bring them to the border. Some Austrians and Germans gathered to welcome the migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34161109  |title=Migrants arrive in Austria after Hungary provides buses |date=2015-09-05 |website=BBC News |agency= |access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A convoy of 140 cars driven by German and Austrian activists also crossed into Hungary to pick up migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34166882 |title=Migrant crisis: Activist convoy drives to Hungary |date=2015-09-06 |website=BBC News |agency= |access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2 September: [[Death of Alan Kurdi]]

*8 September: Hundreds of migrants broke through police lines on Hungary's border with Serbia and began walking towards the capital, Budapest. The migrants had earlier broken out of a registration camp at [[Röszke]]. They threw stones at officers, who responded with pepper spray. About 300 migrants ran on to a nearby motorway, chanting "Germany, Germany".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34180378 |title=Migrant crisis: Hundreds force way past Hungarian police |date=2015-09-08 |website=BBC News |agency= |access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*9 September: Hundreds of migrants, attempting to travel by train from Germany to Sweden, were stopped by police when they entered Denmark. About 200 migrants refused to leave the trains, while about 300 began walking along the [[European route E45|E45 motorway]] towards Sweden. Danish police were forced to close the motorway and suspend all rail links with Germany. The migrants did not want to be registered in Denmark because the government cut benefits for new arrivals and restricted the right to residency, while Sweden promised to issue residency papers to all Syrian asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34203366 |title=Migrant crisis: Denmark-Germany rail links suspended |date=2015-09-09 |website=BBC News |agency= |access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*12 September: Tens of thousands took part in demonstrations in support of refugees and migrants in several European cities. In London, tens of thousands, some carrying placards that read "Open the Borders" and "Refugees In", marched towards the prime minister's residence. About 30,000 rallied outside the Danish parliament in Copenhagen, chanting "Say it loud and say it clear, refugees are welcome here". Other rallies were held in Sweden, France, Austria and the Netherlands. Meanwhile, thousands also took part in demonstrations against mass immigration in [[Warsaw]], [[Prague]], and [[Bratislava]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34235673 |title=Migrant crisis: Rallies in Europe as 9,000 arrive in Munich |date=2015-09-12 |website=BBC News |agency= |access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*13 September: Germany introduced temporary controls on its border with Austria to cope with the inflow of migrants. Trains between Germany and Austria were suspended for 12 hours. Germany's vice-chancellor said the country was "at the limit of its capabilities" as more than 13,000 migrants arrived in Munich in one day, and 40,000 were expected to arrive in Germany over the following weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34239674 |title=Migrant crisis: Germany starts temporary border controls |date=2015-09-14 |website=BBC News |agency= |access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*15 September: Hungary closed its border with Serbia and declared a [[state of emergency]] in two southern counties as new laws to stop migrants entering illegally came into force. The laws made it a crime to cross the border illegally and to damage the newly-built fence along the Hungary-Serbia border. There was a standoff as hundreds of migrants massed at the fence, some throwing down food and water in protest at not being allowed through. Shortly after, Hungary began building a barrier along its border with Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34252812 |title=Migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency at Serbia border |date=2015-09-15 |website=BBC News |agency= |access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*16 September: Hundreds of migrants tried to break through the fence on the Hungary-Serbia border at [[Horgoš]] and threw stones at Hungarian police. They responded with tear gas and water cannon. The Hungarian government said 20 officers were injured and accused migrants of using children as "human shields".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34272765  |title=Migrant crisis: Clashes at Hungary-Serbia border |date=2015-09-16 |website=BBC News |agency= |access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*22 September: EU interior ministers meeting in the [[Justice and Home Affairs Council]] voted by a majority to relocate 120,000 refugees EU-wide. Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia voted against the plan, but they were overruled. The idea was to distribute 120,000 refugees over two years from Greece and Italy. The scheme will only apply to refugees most in need of international protection; not economic migrants. The European Commission proposed that the scheme be mandatory for EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34324096 |title=Migrant crisis: Why EU deal on refugees is difficult |date=2015-09-25 |website=BBC News |agency= |access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tropfest 2011.jpg|thumb|Tropfest in Sydney, February 2011]]
'''Tropfest''' is the world's largest [[short film]] [[film festival|festival]]. It has also become known as the world's first global film festival.

Founded by actor/director [[John Polson]], Tropfest began in 1993 as a screening for 200 people at the 'Tropicana Caffe'  in [[Darlinghurst, Sydney]], Australia, but has since become the largest platform for short films in the world. Tropfest Australia usually takes place in December each year in Sydney and is broadcast live to various cities around Australia to an audience of approximately 150,000. Sydney Tropfest 2015 was cancelled less than a month before it was scheduled to run. After much support on social media, Tropfest founder Polson announced in early December 2015 that extra funding had been sourced, and the festival took place in [[Centennial Park, Sydney|Centennial Park]] on Sunday, 14 February 2016. In August 2016 it was announced that from February 2017 Sydney's Tropfest would be held in [[Parramatta]] in western Sydney.

==Entry requirements==
Tropfest differs from other cinema events by being a "content generation" platform, rather than an exhibition platform. Filmmakers are required to create new works for the festival which must include an item, known as the "[[Tropfest#Signature item|Tropfest Signature Item]]" (TSI) and which changes each year. The films must be less than 7 minutes (including titles and credits) and be world premieres at the Tropfest event.

==History==
The festival's name is derived from the first year's location—the Tropicana Caffe in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]], an inner-eastern suburb of Sydney.&lt;ref name=tropcaf-hist&gt;{{cite web|title=Tropicana Cafe - History|url=http://www.tropicanacaffe.com/index.php/history|publisher=Tropicana Cafe|accessdate=6 December 2015|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by Australian-born filmmaker John Polson, the first festival was held in 1993 and was originally called the '''Tropicana Short Film Festival'''.

The support and involvement of film personalities from around the world has become one of the trademarks of the festival. Selection of the winning Tropfest film takes place live on the night of the festival by a panel of high-profile industry and celebrity judges, in addition to the previous year's winner. Past judges have included [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Rose Byrne]], [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[John Woo]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Baz Luhrmann]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Sam Neill]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Jane Campion]], [[Salma Hayek]], [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Gabriel Byrne]]. Corporate supporters have included [[Intel]], [[Sony]], [[Qantas]], [[Cointreau]] and [[Howard Park Wines|MadFish Wines]]. [[Movie Network|Movie Extra]] used to be the primary sponsor of Tropfest Australia, which is now supported by [[CGU plc|CGU]], [[Holden]], [[Parramatta City Council]], [[Screen Australia]], [[Western Sydney University|WSU]], [[Parramatta Park, New South Wales|Parramatta Park]] and [[Melrose Park, New South Wales|Melrose Park]].

The festival attracts a wide degree of media coverage but it is the casual, [[grassroots]] nature of the event, rather than its high profile, which ensures the continued support of its patrons and guests. Notable alumni include filmmakers such as [[Alister Grierson]], [[Rowan Woods]], [[Clayton Jacobson (director)|Clayton Jacobson]], [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Nash Edgerton]], Peter Carstairs, [[Rob Carlton]], [[Sam Worthington]], [[Robert Connolly]], [[Leon Ford]], Justin Drape, Tim Bullock and [[Elissa Down]].  

Tropfest now includes the popular [[Trop Jr]], a short filmmaking competition and festival for youngsters under 16. 

Other Tropfest programs include:

* APRA TROPSCORE, a film scoring and synching competition, and
* Nikon DSLR Film Category, a category in the competition awarding short films created using DSLR technology

==Locations==
The main event from 1993 to 2016 took place in [[Sydney]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydney.com/events|title=Sydney Events|publisher=Sydney.com|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but live satellite events are also staged in [[Melbourne]], [[Canberra]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Hobart]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and other cities. The event is broadcast live on television by [[ABC Comedy]] and webcast to viewers around Australia and the world. In August 2016 it was announced that, beginning in February 2017, the venue would be moved to [[Parramatta]] in western Sydney.&lt;ref name="Abc-mve-parra"&gt;{{cite news |title=Parramatta to host Tropfest |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-15/tropfest-short-film-festival-moves-to-parramatta/7736308 |accessdate=17 August 2016 |work=ABC News u|publisher=ABC Australia |date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropfest has expanded to locations around the world including Japan, [[Turkey]], [[Africa]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[London]], [[Berlin]], [[Toronto]], [[Bangkok]], and [[New York City]]. The inaugural [[Tropfest Arabia]], encompassing approximately 33 countries throughout the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], took place in Abu Dhabi in November 2011. Tropfest launched into the United States in June 2012, with a weekend-long event in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and a fully-fledged Tropfest New York competition in New York on 23 June 2012 at Manhattan's [[Bryant Park]]. Tropfest New Zealand launched in 2013 and Tropfest South East Asia at [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]] in 2014.

==Festival==
[[File:Madfish tropfest 2009.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Tropfest 2009 at [[Howard Park Wines|MadFish Winery]] Margaret River, Western Australia]]
In 2006 there were over 700 entrants and every year 16 finalists are screened in public parks and cafes around Australia. Sydney's annual audience of around 100,000 people attended [[The Domain, Sydney|The Domain]] to watch the finalists on three large video screens.  Over 150,000 people attend Australia-wide.

The Sydney screening of Tropfest 2006 was abandoned after 13 films due to severe electrical storms. Screenings in other cities were not affected. With the judges located in Sydney it was necessary to announce the winners two days later at a press conference.

Each film must be no longer than seven minutes, have never been shown publicly before and contain the "Tropfest Signature Item", which changes each year, to show that the film was made specifically for the festival.

In April 2007, Tropfest formed a partnership with [[PBL Media]] which would see festival content archived and screened across various PBL properties and brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Bodey | coauthors= | title=PBL's long-term plan for Tropfest shorts | date=19 April 2007 | publisher= | url =http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21580275-7582,00.html | work =The Australian | pages = | accessdate = 2007-04-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Tropfest 2009, pay television channel [[Movie Network|Movie Extra]] replaced Sony as the naming rights sponsor for the next seven years.  A new feature in 2009 was the live national broadcast of Tropfest and screening of the finalist films on the Movie Extra channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bandt.com.au/dirplus/images/bttoday/newsletter/07_08_2008.pdf Tropfest loses Sony and gains Movie Extra] - B&amp;T Today, 7 Aug 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320172511/http://www.bandt.com.au/dirplus/images/bttoday/newsletter/07_08_2008.pdf |date=20 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropfest Australia 2011 was the largest Tropfest ever staged, and reached a national audience of approximately 1,000,000 people (not including the internet).

Prior to the first full Tropfest New York competition in June 2012, Tropfest held annual New York screenings between 2006 and 2008. Signature items were a manhole cover, a slice, and a sunflower respectively. In November 2011, ahead of the 2012 competition, filmmakers were invited to "grab a camera, start shooting and tell their story through film", using the Tropfest NY 2012 Signature Item of "Bagel".

Over a weekend in June 2012, [[Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas|The Cosmopolitan]] in Las Vegas celebrated Tropfest's 20th anniversary, culminating in a screening of the best 16 films from the past two decades in the Tropfest All Star Competition. With judges Toni Collette (President of the Jury), [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Rebel Wilson]], [[James Woods]], [[Anthony LaPaglia]], Trevor Groth and Charles Randolph presiding over the competition, ''The Story of Bubble Boy'', directed by Sean Ascroft, ultimately took out the top prize.

A few weeks later, on 23 June 2012, Tropfest New York had its debut in [[Bryant Park]]. Hosted by Hugh Jackman and including musical performances by [[Alexi Murdoch]] and [[Milagres (band)|Milagres]], the festival attracted a crowd of approximately 10,000. Judges [[Rose Byrne]], [[Judah Friedlander]], [[Jennifer Westfeldt]], Scott Foundas and [[Ted Hope]] awarded the $20,000 first prize to director Josh Leake for his film ''Emptys''.  Tropfest NY 2013 festival was held on 22 June in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, with a bridge as the signature item.  In 2014 Tropfest postponed its New York event.  The festival has said a 2015 event will be held, using a kiss as the signature item, which was originally announced for 2014.

Tropfest has one of the most successful channels on [[YouTube]], having attracted more than 31,000,000 video views for its films in a relatively short time period.{{clarify|date=January 2013}}

In February 2013 festival founder John Polson announced a change of date to 8 December and a change of venue from the Domain to [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hardie|first1=Giles|title=It's time to leave home as Tropfest turns 21|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/its-time-to-leave-home-as-tropfest-turns-21-20130217-2el7m.html|accessdate=2 March 2015|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''We feel like we are changing gears, we are growing every year and Centennial Park is in some ways the emotional heart of Sydney''

The winner of the December 2013 festival, ''Bamboozled'', was accused of [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]].&lt;ref name=news-bamboozled&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/tropfest-winner-bamboozled-accused-of-transphobia/story-e6frfmvr-1226779160847|title=Tropfest winner Bamboozled accused of transphobia |date=9 December 2013|work=[[News Corp Australia]]|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a comedy in which a man sleeps with a man he believes to be his [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioned]] ex-girlfriend.&lt;ref name=news-bamboozled/&gt;

==2015 cancellation==
On 11 November Polson announced that the 2015 Sydney Tropfest had been cancelled. He said "... I have been made aware that the company contracted to raise the funding and administer the Tropfest event is unable to move forward for financial reasons.".&lt;ref name=abc-2015-cancel&gt;{{cite news |title=Tropfest short film festival cancelled over 'terrible mismanagement' of funds |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-11/tropfest-cancelled-over-terrible-mismanagement-of-funds/6933142 |accessdate=11 November 2015 |work=ABC News|agency=ABC |date=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=facebook-2015-cancel&gt;{{cite web |title=2015 Tropfest Cancelled |url=https://www.facebook.com/tropfest/posts/973324956047111 |website=Facebook |publisher=Tropfest Pty Ltd |accessdate=11 November 2015 |date=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEO of Tropfest Festival Productions, Michael Laverty, has been unavailable for comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mlaverty18|title=Michael Laverty (@mlaverty18) - Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/tropfest-cancelled-after-huge-hole-in-funding-20151111-gkwoxv.html|title=Exclusive: Tropfest cancelled after 'huge hole' in funding|first=Garry|last=Maddox|date=11 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial difficulties===
Polsons said he had discovered to his “surprise” Tropfest was facing a financial crisis and could not proceed due to a lack of funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9news.com.au/national/2015/11/12/05/20/tropfest-founder-launches-legal-action-as-festival-cancelled|title=Tropfest founder launches legal action as festival cancelled|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged the management company Polson had fallen out with over the alleged “mismanagement” of Tropfest funds was managed by Laverty, his long-time Tropfest partner and its managing director.

Over the following days it emerged suppliers and contracted partners of Tropfest have been experiencing payment delays for several months. As of 14 November Laverty was un-contactable for any comments.&lt;ref name=d-tele-fallout/&gt; Commercial entertainment services agency The Intersection, who was retained in 2014 by Tropfest issued a statement on Facebook stating its relationship with Tropfest ended in 2014 over a pay dispute.&lt;ref name=d-tele-fallout&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/tropfest-john-polson-and-michael-laverty-fall-out-over-funding-crisis/story-fni0cvc9-1227606938007 The Daily Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

An outpouring of support for Tropfest quickly appeared over social media, including Twitter and Facebook, with calls for generous benefactors, state or federal government support, or crowd-funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-12/tropfest-cancellation-public-reaction/6933336|title=Tropfest cancellation sparks outpouring of support|date=12 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December Polson announced that the Sydney festival would be held in its intended venue, Centennial Park on Sunday, 14 February 2016.  [[CGU Insurance]] is the source of the necessary extra funding.&lt;ref name=abc-tropfest-on&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropfest film festival set to return after securing financial lifeline, organisers say|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-06/tropfest-secures-financial-lifeline-organisers/7005144|accessdate=6 December 2015|work=ABC News|agency=ABC|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signature item==
Each year, Tropfest requires that entries include a particular "signature item" or action to ensure that they are unique and are made specifically for the festival. No TSI was required for the 1993 festival. The following are TSIs by year:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tropfest.com/au/tsi/|title=TSI|publisher=Tropfest|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Tsukimi'''|月見}} or {{Nihongo|'''Otsukimi'''|お月見}}, literally ''moon-viewing'', also known as {{Nihongo|'''Jugoya'''|十五夜}}, are Japanese festivals honoring the autumn moon, a variant of the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]]. The celebration of the [[full moon]] typically takes place on the 15th day of the eighth month of the traditional [[Japanese calendar]]; the [[Lunar phase|waxing moon]] is celebrated on the 13th day of the ninth month. These days normally fall in September and October of the modern [[solar calendar]].

The tradition dates to the [[Heian era]], and is now so popular in Japan that some people repeat the activities for several evenings following the appearance of the full moon during the eighth lunisolar month.

Tsukimi traditions include displaying decorations made from [[Miscanthus sinensis|Japanese pampas grass]] (''susuki'') and eating rice dumplings called ''Tsukimi [[dango]]'' in order to celebrate the beauty of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/25/where-to-view-the-harvest-moon/|date=September 25, 2015|publisher=[[The Denver Post]]|author= Colleen Smith|title=Where to view the harvest moon?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seasonal produce are also displayed as offerings to the moon. [[Sweet potato]]es are offered to the full moon, while beans or chestnuts are offered to the waxing moon the following month. The alternate names of the celebrations, ''Imomeigetsu''　(literally "potato harvest moon") and ''Mamemeigetsu'' ("bean harvest moon") or ''Kurimeigetsu'' ("chestnut harvest moon") are derived from these offerings.

==History==
Tsukimi refers to the Japanese tradition of holding parties to view the [[harvest moon]]. The custom is thought to have originated with Japanese aristocrats during the [[Heian period]],{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2011}} who would gather to recite [[poetry]] under the full moon of the eighth month of the [[solar calendar]], known as the "Mid-Autumn Moon." Since ancient times, Japanese people have described the eighth solar month (corresponding to September on the contemporary [[Gregorian calendar]]) as the best time for looking at the moon, since the relative positions of the earth, sun, and moon cause the moon to appear especially bright.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}  On the evening of the full moon, it is traditional to gather in a place where the moon can be seen clearly, decorate the scene with Japanese pampas grass, and to serve white rice dumplings (known as ''Tsukimi dango''), [[taro]], [[edamame]], [[chestnut]]s and other seasonal foods, plus [[sake]] as offerings to the moon in order to pray for an abundant harvest. These dishes are known collectively as {{nihongo|Tsukimi dishes|月見料理|tsukimi ryōri}}. Due to the ubiquity of sweet potato or taro among these dishes, the tradition is known as {{nihongo|Imomeigetsu|芋名月}} or "Potato harvest moon" in some parts of Japan.

From 862 until 1683, the Japanese calendar was arranged so that the full moon fell on the 13th day of each month. In 1684, however, the calendar was altered so that the [[new moon]] fell on the first day of each month, moving the full moon two weeks later, to the 15th day of the month. While some people in [[Edo]] (present-day [[Tokyo]]) shifted their Tsukimi activities to the 15th day of the month, others continued to observe the festival on the 13th day. Furthermore, there were various regional observances in some parts of Japan on the 17th day of the month, as well as Buddhist observances on the 23rd or the 26th day, all of which were used as pretexts for often late-night parties during the autumn throughout the [[Edo period]]. This custom was brought to a swift end during the [[Meiji period]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Festivals dedicated to the moon have a long history in Japan. During the [[Heian period]] elements of the [[China|Chinese]] [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] were introduced to Japan. Members of the aristocratic class would hold moon-viewing events aboard boats in order to view the moon's reflection on the surface of the water. The writing of [[waka (poetry)|tanka]] poetry was also an element of such mid-autumn moon viewing festivities.

There are specific terms in Japanese to refer to occasions when the moon is not visible on the traditional mid-autumn evening, including {{nihongo|Mugetsu|無月||"no-moon"}} and {{nihongo|Ugetsu|雨月||"rain-moon"}}. Even when the moon is not visible, however, Tsukimi parties are held. A Unicode [[emoji]] exists for Tsukimi, featuring pampas grass, dango and the moon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Liz|title=This is what some of the weirdest emojis actually mean|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/world-emoji-day-this-is-what-some-of-the-weirdest-emojis-actually-mean-a3589416.html|accessdate=26 March 2018|work=Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Related foods==
It is traditional to serve Tsukimi [[dango]] and seasonal produce offerings during Tsukimi, as described above. In addition, there are several other dishes associated with Tsukimi.

Boiled [[soba]] or [[udon]] noodles topped with [[nori]] and raw egg, then covered with broth are known as ''Tsukimi soba'' or ''Tsukimi udon''. In [[Kitakyushu]] an egg served atop [[yaki udon]] is known as ''Tenmado'', another name for Tsukimi in the local dialect. Similarly when a raw quail egg is used to top sushi, like battleship sushi [[gunkanzushi]] or a handroll [[temaki]] it is referred to as tsukimi style. Confectionary, such as [[Mooncake]]s, are also enjoyed.

At some fast food restaurants in Japan a special Fall Menu is offered during September and October featuring [[fried egg]] sandwiches known as ''Tsukimi burgers''.

The '''Venetian Theatre''' is a movie theater, performing arts venue, and restaurant in downtown [[Hillsboro, Oregon]], [[United States]]. Formerly the '''Town Theater''', the building re-opened in 2008 after more than a decade of inactivity and revitalization plans. Built in 1888 as a bank, later mayor [[Orange Phelps]] converted the property into a theater in 1911 and in 1925 converted it into a two-story [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] building with a larger auditorium. Prior to renovation the theater was owned by the city of Hillsboro who purchased it from [[Act III Theatres]]. The theatre has been temporarily closed since mid-April 2017 in connection with a planned change of ownership. However, that sale fell through, and the theater and restaurant remain closed in August 2017. In late August, its owner told the ''[[Hillsboro Tribune]]'' that he had found a new buyer, but it is not known when the Venetian might reopen.

==History==
In 1888, banker [[John W. Shute]] built a two-story building on East Main Street as the new home for the First National Bank of Hillsboro.&lt;ref name=hhs&gt;[http://www.hillsborohistorical.org/tour/cc/towntheater.html  Town Theater.] Hillsboro Historical Society. Retrieved on August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure featured a façade in the Italianate style of architecture, external cast iron ornamentation, and a roof line with a bracketed cornice.&lt;ref name=hhs/&gt; In 1911, the bank moved across Main Street and later mayor Orange Phelps purchased the building.&lt;ref name=hhs/&gt; Although Phelps did not have the money to buy the building, the bank loaned him the funds and he opened The Grand Theater, a 200-seat theater.&lt;ref name=argus&gt;Doctor, Jerri. “Phelps personifies pioneer spirit”. ''[[The Hillsboro Argus]]'', October 19, 1976, Historic Potpourri, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|19|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|120|ft|m}} long theater was expanded in 1915 to 500 seats and named the Liberty Theater.&lt;ref name=argus/&gt;&lt;ref name=cost&gt;Anderson, David R. “Cost to renovate Town Theater soars”. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', May 9, 2002, West Zoner, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, a fire destroyed the theater and Phelps rebuilt the structure and named the new theater The Venetian.&lt;ref name=vt&gt;[http://www.venetiantheatre.com/web/about/default.asp History.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714003353/http://www.venetiantheatre.com/web/about/default.asp |date=2011-07-14 }} Venetian Theatre &amp; Bistro. Retrieved on August 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first motion picture with sound shown in Hillsboro was ''[[The Broadway Melody]]'' in 1929 at the theater.&lt;ref name=argus/&gt; Beginning in 1935 Phelps held an annual free show for children at Christmas which continued into the 1990s.&lt;ref name=argus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Hillsboro chamber plans series of holiday events”. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', November 22, 1990, West Zoner, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, a fire gutted the building, with Phelps rebuilding and opening the following year as the 800-plus seat Town Theater.&lt;ref name=argus/&gt; After the fire Phelps had held double features at his Town Theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 10, 1956|title=Town's Remaining Theatre Will Do Double Duty|journal=Boxoffice|volume=70|issue=3|pages=42|url=http://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_111056-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the theater hosted the premiere of the film [[Ring of Fire (1961 film)|''Ring of Fire'']], which had been filmed in [[Vernonia, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=argus/&gt; Phelps owned the theater along with several other theaters in [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]] into the 1970s.&lt;ref name=argus/&gt; Tom Moyer Theaters purchased Phelps’ theaters in 1978 and in turn sold all of that theater chain’s screens to [[Act III Theatres]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=vt/&gt;&lt;ref name=act3&gt;Colby, Richard N. “Hillsboro buys Town Theater for a pittance: $1,500”. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', December 19, 1996, West Zoner, p. C4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Act III closed the theater and sold the building to the city for $1,500.&lt;ref name=act3/&gt;

After purchasing the property the city proposed several redevelopment ideas for the building, including selling it to the [[McMenamins]] brewpub chain for a theater and pub.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;&lt;ref name=pub&gt;Anderson, David R. “Hillsboro sees downtown storefront as enhancement to theater’s rebirth”. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', June 8, 2001, West Zoner, p. C3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Hillsboro purchased the adjoining {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building (home to Music Village at the time) for $160,000 to add to the property to be used for any redevelopment of the theater.&lt;ref&gt;“Council purchases property for an entertainment venue”. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', September 20, 2001, Portland Zoner, p.

In August 2007, the city sold the building to developer Denzil Scheller for $10 and gave him $750,000 to assist in the renovation of the deteriorating building.&lt;ref name=sale&gt;Rostami, Marjon. “Town Theater renovation promises to enliven downtown”.

''[[The Oregonian]]'', May 15, 2008, Metro West Neighbors, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this $2.5 million, around $1.5 million came from his own funds, and the remainder came from city funds along with $250,000 from Metro in the conversion of the space into a theater, meeting space, restaurant, and live event venue.&lt;ref name=venetian/&gt; Work included gutting the building to rebuild the support structure, removing asbestos, and opening a wall into the adjacent Music Village building.&lt;ref name=downtown&gt;Boone, Jerry F. “Downtown, anticipation is building”.

In early 2017, owner Denzil Scheller reported that he had reached a tentative agreement to sell the theater to a buyer who, for now, wished to remain anonymous.

The '''Viking raids in the Rhineland''' were part of a series of invasions of [[Francia]] by the [[Vikings]] that took place during the final decades of the 9th century. From the Rhineland, which can be regarded as the nucleus of Frankish culture, the [[Franks]] had previously conquered almost the whole of Central Europe and established a great empire.

During these raids, the Vikings plundered the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] cities of [[Cologne]], [[Bonn]], [[Xanten]], [[Trier]] and also the [[imperial city]] of [[Aachen]], in which [[Charlemagne]] was buried and on whose throne the Frankish [[king]]s were crowned in [[Aachen Cathedral]]. In addition to these cities, numerous monasteries were also destroyed, together with entire [[libraries]] in which  collections of writings from several centuries had been preserved. This shook the essence of Frankish culture.

Similar raids affected the Scandinavian regions where the Vikings had originally settled: the [[British Isles]], [[Baltic Sea]] region, [[Russia]] and the [[Viking Raids into the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean region]]. Many inhabitants of the affected regions were carted off as [[Slavery|slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen (2004), 132, 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term'' Rhineland'' is used to describe areas on the Middle and Lower Rhine that are not defined in more detail. It was not designated as such until 1798, when [[French Revolution]]ary troops occupied this territory. Previously, this region was mostly named after towns or [[Grafschaft|counties]] , for example, the [[Province of Gelderland|Gelderland]], or Land of Cleves (Klever Land).

[[File: Droysens-21c.jpg|thumb|The Franconian Frankish kingdoms c. 880; the Rhineland lies in the western part of [[East Francia]]]]

The area known today as the Rhineland begins at the confluence of the [[Moselle]] and the [[Rhine]] and ends at [[Emmerich am Rhein|Emmerich]], where the Rhine divides into the Lek and the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] to form a [[river delta|delta]]. In the east, the Rhineland ends close to the Rhine itself, being bounded by low mountain ranges such as the [[Siebengebirge]] or [[Bergisches Land]]. To the west its boundary is less well defined, but in general parlance it runs beyond the present state border with the Netherlands, i.e. east of the Meuse. Because the modern state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] lies south of the Moselle, the low mountain range of the [[Eifel]] north of the river is usually seen as belonging to the Rhineland. Areas south of the Moselle, such as the [[Hunsrück]], are also considered to be part of the Rhineland.

== The Rhineland in the Carolingian period ==
The heartland of the [[Carolingians]] lay, for the most part, in territories that were part of the  Rhineland. As a result, important sites of Carolingian culture are located here. Of particular note are the city of [[Aachen]], where Charlemagne had his imperial palace or [[Palace of Aachen|''Kaiserpfalz'']] built, and also the [[Benedictine]] abbey in [[Prüm]]; the latter mainly because of its ''[[scriptorium]]'' and associated [[library]]. The old Roman cities of [[Trier]], [[Cologne]], [[Xanten]] and [[Bonn]] were also located in the Rhineland and were used by the Franks as centres of trading and [[episcopal seat]]s. In 843 AD, the Frankish Empire was divided into three kingdoms. Most areas of the Rhineland fell into the dominion of [[Lothair I]] and were named [[Lotharii Regnum|Lothringen]]. This was the middle kingdom that ran from the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea with no border crossings between East and West Francia. After this division of the empire, almost all areas of the former great empire experienced conflicts over [[power (social and political)|power]] of a [[civil war]]like nature. The Rhineland was also affected by this. When Lothair I died in 855 without an heir to his throne, the power struggles intensified. In 870, following the [[Treaty of Meersen]], the Rhineland was assigned to [[East Francia]]. Ten years later, the[[Treaty of Ribemont]] specified the boundaries more precisely. The map opposite shows the result.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Jennifer Striewski: Wikinger am Mittelrhein.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vikings and Franks ==
After the defeat of [[Saxons|Saxony]] (772-804) the empire of [[Charlemagne]] extended to the mouth of the Elbe and beyond. By this time at the latest, the first contacts with the Vikings who, like the Saxons, worshipped [[Old Norse religion|pagan gods]], took place.

[[File:Arrival at Valhalla.jpg|thumb|Entry into Valhalla (relief from [[Gotland]])]]

These contacts were often [[war]]like in nature. The Frisian islands were affected as well as the Frisian mainland. To ward off the attacks, Charlemagne set up a [[march (territory)|march]] on the northern border of his empire, the name of today's state of [[Denmark]] being derived from it. Despite the warlike situation on the northern border, many Vikings were used as [[mercenaries]] in Frankish campaigns.

The Vikings were bold raiders, perhaps because of the [[code of honour]] they are purported to have had, According to legend, the [[god of war]], [[Odin]], from the [[Æsir|Asa]] line of gods, prepared to fight for the world and its survival. He sent his messengers, the [[valkyries]], to escort the bravest warriors killed in a battle to [[Valhalla]]. The warriors who gathered there, called ''[[Einherjar]]'', practised the art of warfare during the daytime. In the evening, after their wounds had healed, the army of the dead moved into Odin's hall together, where there was always a filled drinking horn and a good meal. Whether this code of honour existed or not, much of their fighting was, in any case, against civilian populations and weakly defended towns and monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Edmund Mudrak|Title=Die Sagen der Germanen - Nordische Götter und Heldensagen|Publisher=Ensslin &amp; Laiblin Verlag|PublicationPlace=Reutlingen|Year=1961|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;30–32|Date=   1961|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Willemsen (2004), 155–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first Viking kings to be baptized was [[Harald Klak]] who, in 826, became a vassal of King [[Louis the German]] at [[Ingelheim am Rhein]] and was baptized in Mainz with his wife and son.

During this time, the [[Vikings]] attacked the [[Frankish Empire]] sailing their ships up the big rivers from the [[North Sea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Such raids mainly affected areas on the [[Seine]] and in modern-day [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. Previously, the Vikings had raided  England ([[Lindisfarne Abbey|Lindisfarne]], 793) and Ireland ([[Dublin]], 795). In 820, the first major attack by Vikings on the Frankish Empire was recorded, taking place around the mouth of the river Seine, and at the same time other Vikings probably invaded Flanders. In 845, [[Paris]] was attacked for the first time with about 700 [[longship]]s up the Seine. The Parisians bought the raiders off with 7,000 pounds of silver. By 926, thirteen of these payments have been documented in the Frankish Empire.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Capelle: ''Nicht nur Nacht- und Nebelaktionen.'' In: Ulrich Löber (Hrsg.): ''Die Wikinger. Begleitpublikation zur Sonderausstellung „Die Wikinger“ des Landesmuseums Koblenz und des Statens Historiska Museums Stockholm.'' Koblenz 1998, pp. 87-94, here p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The Elbe estuary and the already fortified city of [[Hamburg]] were attacked by Danish warriors in 845.

Initially, the attacks took the form of raids and the Vikings withdrew to their homeland afterwards. In the 860s, they changed tactics and established permanent bases in [[Francia]], from where they coordinated their raids, and sometimes overwintered in their fortified army camps. The [[Rhineland]], the heartland of the Frankish Empire, was little affected by the Vikings at that time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The Vikings were not a united people, but a collection of warring tribes; small wars between Viking tribes were frequent, united large-scale attacks were preceded in principle by purposeful diplomatic negotiations. Since the Vikings could only be driven out of the occupied territories at great cost, attempts were occasionally made to involve their leaders in the Empire by means of rich gifts and the granting of [[fief]]doms. As a rule, these Viking leaders were expected to be baptized beforehand, since the Frankish empire was considered by the Frankish [[nobility]] to be a gift from [[Jesus Christ|God]] and so there were no thrones for higher nobles who were unbelievers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Raids of 862 and 864 ==
Between 834 and 863 the Vikings laid waste eight times to the trading post of [[Dorestad]] on the [[Lek (river)|Lek]] river, a town that competed with the Danish town of Haithabu. In 862, Vikings attacked up the Rhine for the first time and plundered Cologne. In 863, the Normans conquered [[Utrecht]] and [[Nijmegen]] and established permanent winter camps in both towns; Dorestad was razed during the campaign. In 864, the left there on a second campaign into the Lower Rhine territories and ambushed and plundered the city of [[Xanten]] which had been founded by the [[Romans]].&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen (2004), 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trade and navigation on the Rhine between 864 and 881 ==
[[File:Sea Stallion lowering sail, crop.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed Viking ship, [[Havhingsten fra Glendalough]], mid-11th century]]

The Franks were not real seafarers - although there were types of ship (e.g. the Utrecht ship) which, in good weather, were suitable for coastal navigation. However, since no wrecks of such boats have been found in the North Sea to date, their use for coastal navigation must be assumed to be rare.&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen (2004), 62.&lt;/ref&gt; There were different construction methods for boats. Some were made of large, hollowed out, tree-trunks; others were more like rafts. Both types were difficult to manoeuvre and were used for transporting heavy goods such as rocks. The quarries were often ruined Roman buildings near the Rhine, but there were also quarries in the neighbouring mountain ranges. These boats floated down the river with the current or were hauled upriver as barges pulled by horses or oxen, a technique known as ''treideln''.

The main building material in the Frankish Empire was wood. Logs were tied together and rafted downriver to the markets, and other commodities and travellers were transported on rafts which, in  some cases, were very long and wide.&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen (2004), 55–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Vikings settled on the banks of the Rhine delta, they had a competitive advantage as traders, because their outstanding [[shipbuilding]] technology enabled them to overcome strong[currents]] like those of the Rhine, so they were able to ship goods quickly. As a result, trade in the Rhineland flourished. Since Vikings had also settled in Ireland, England and Russia at the same time, trade goods expanded to include products from and beyond the more distant regions.&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen (2004), 64-71. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Winter raids of 881/882 ==
[[File: Vikinghjelm, Gjermundbu.jpg|thumb|Viking helmet, probably damaged by a cutting weapon]]

The situation changed when the so-called [[Great Heathen Army]] suffered a severe defeat in 878 at [[Edington, Wiltshire|Edington]] in southwest [[England]] at the hands of King [[Alfred the Great]] (reigned 871-899) and his army suffered a severe defeat. The defeated Vikings then set off for continental Europe and transferred their theatre of war to the coastal region of the [[English Channel]], Northern France and [[Flanders]]. On 3 August 881, the West Francian king [[Louis III of France|Louis III]] with his army also won victory over the Normans at [[Nibas|Saucourt-en-Vimeu]] in central France.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The Vikings then turned their aggression eastwards towards the Rhineland. [[Charles III of East Francia|Charles III]] was residing in [[Italy]] at this time because of his imperial coronation which had taken place on 12 February 881 in [[Rome]]. For the celebrations he was accompanied by numerous armoured knights; thus many of his best armed warriors were not available to defend their homeland in the winter of 881.

Despite the invasion of West Francia by the Great Army in 878, no defensive measures had apparently been taken in East Francian Rhineland, since the [[city walls]] of individual cities were only reinforced when the Vikings were almost at the [[city gates]]. Thus, because of the imperial coronation of Charles III in Rome, the population of the Rhine was almost defenceless and at the mercy of the Vikings' attack, and fleeing was the best course of action to save lives and goods. As a result, the Vikings often captured entire towns, villages and monasteries without fighting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

=== Raids in the Rhine-Meuse area ===
In late 881, Vikings, who had overwintered in Flanders, set off on a military expedition to neighbouring lands. They raided numerous villages in the area of the Meuse and razed the towns of [[Liège]], [[Maastricht]] and [[Tongeren]] to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen (2004), 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silverdale Hoard group shot.jpg|thumb|[[Hoard]] from the Viking period]]

In December 881, Vikings of this group sailed on at least three ships under their leader, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia|Godfrid]], up the Rhine. As they went, they plundered villages and towns or extorted money from their inhabitants (''Brandschatzung'').

Particularly affected were the cities of [[Cologne]], [[Bonn]], [[Neuss]], [[Jülich]] and [[Andernach]]. On their first visit to Cologne in January 882, after tough negotiations, Cologne paid a fortune in silver for their withdrawal (see also [[Danegeld]]). On their return journey, the same group again demanded payment of a sum of money, which the destitute citizens of Cologne could not afford, whereupon the city was burned to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs (1990), 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Normans, presumably from Denmark, probably also carried horses on their [[Viking ship]]s. In any case, they were very mobile, something that was aided by being able to utilise the old [[Roman road]]s of the Rhineland on the left bank of the Rhine. The Vikings turned westwards following this road system and plundered towns from [[Zülpich]] to [[Aachen]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

=== Raids on cultural centres in the Aachen area ===
[[File:Palais charlemagne.svg|thumb|Artist's impression of the [[Palace of Aachen]] (c. 800) with the [[octagon]] of the cathedral (top left), the thermal spa (bottom left) and the palace (bottom right)]]

When they had stormed the imperial city, the conquerors, presumably with calculated, strategic intent, desecrated [[Aachen Cathedral|St. Mary's Church]] (now the cathedral), the tomb of [[Charlemagne]] and the royal stables. After committing these outrages, they set the [[Palace of Aachen|palace]] and the [[Thermae|imperial baths]] on fire. In late December 881, they plundered the [[Kornelimünster Abbey|imperial abbey of Kornelimünster]], not far from Aachen, as well as the monasteries of [[Stablo Abbey|Stablo]] and [[Malmedy Abbey|Malmedy]] in the [[Ardennes]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

=== First attack on Prüm Abbey ===
On 6 January 882, [[Epiphany (holiday)|Three Kings' Day]], a detachment of Vikings which, according to historical reports, was about 300 strong, attacked the largest Frankish abbey, [[Prüm Abbey|Prüm]] in the [[Eifel]] mountains. In the abbey church was the grave of Emperor [[Lothair I]] who died there in 855 after concluding the [[Treaty of Prüm]]. Attached to the monastery was a [[hospital]] and an important [[monastic school]] in which the offspring of the Frankish nobility were educated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Willemsen (2004), 109&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbey also housed one of the most extensive [[monastic library|libraries]] in the Empire with its ''[[scriptorium]]''. Apart from Aachen, Prüm was the cultural centre of the Frankish Empire. The abbey had extensive estates; more than a hundred churches were under its administration; its lands extended far into the present-day Netherlands, and the forests along the Moselle also belonged to the monastery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

A band of peasants from the area resisted the attackers, but were massacred. As a result, the Vikings set all the buildings of the monastery on fire. The abbey burned down to the ground, ''"since there was no one left alive to fight the fire"''&lt;ref&gt;Regino of Prüm, 882&lt;/ref&gt;. Among the monastery's greatest treasures was one of the most precious [[relic]]s of [[Western Christianity]], the [[Sandals of Christ]], which were carried to safety before the Viking onslaught. Of the manuscript collection, however, which was often praised by chroniclers before, only about one tenth of the collection was able to be rescued in front of the marauding Vikings; the rest perished in the flames.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

=== 882 Moselle raid ===
The King of East Francia, [[Louis III of East Francia|Louis III]] raised an army and rushed to help the Rhinelanders. On 20 January, the king died unexpectedly in [[Frankfurt]], whereupon the army he led against the Vikings was disbanded. The Vikings then moved further up the Rhine. In the course of February and March 882 they attacked as far as [[Koblenz]], pillaging and murdering, but the city was able to resist them thanks to strong fortifications dating back to Roman times. However, the lands outside its walls were devastated. At the same time, in [[Mainz]], the dilapidated Roman walls were quickly fortified again and the citizens of Mainz began to dig a [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]] around the city. The Vikings, however, did not move from Koblenz to Mainz, but sailed up the Moselle and reached the Trier countryside during Easter week.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[File:Trier Porta Nigra BW 1.JPG|thumb|The city gate of [[Porta Nigra]] in Trier. Despite its Roman fortifications, Trier was conquered twice by the Vikings.]]

In [[Easter Week]], 882, the Nordic raiders attacked and destroyed the monasteries, churches and farmsteads outside the city walls of Trier. The imperial monastery of [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier|St. Maximin]] and the abbeys of {{ill|St. Martin's Abbey, Trier|lt=St. Martin|de|Abtei St. Martin}} and [[St. Symphorian's Abbey|St. Symphorian]], north of the ancient city wall, were destroyed; the latter never being rebuilt. The monastery of [[Basilica of St. Paulinus, Trier|St. Paulinus]] was spared.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriele B. Clemens, Lukas Clemens: ''Geschichte der Stadt Trier.'' Beck, Munich, 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-406-55618-0}}, pp. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Maundy Thursday]], 5 April, 882, the Vikings captured the city itself. After a few days of rest, they plundered Trier on [[Easter Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;As in Prüm, the attack occurred on a major holiday. Since it was the most important Christian holiday and there had been a break in the fighting after Trier was captured, it can be assumed that the pause and subsequent devastation of Trier were deliberately timed to coincide with Easter.&lt;/ref&gt; Among their targets was [[Trier Cathedral]].  [[Regino of Prüm]] records numerous victims among the population, but Archbishop [[Bertulf of Trier]] managed to escape to [[Metz]] with a few of his followers. Afterwards, some of the Vikings went down the Moselle with their booty to Koblenz, while the rest marched on Metz.

The Vikings advancing to Metz were met on 11 April 882 by an army led by the Bishop of Metz, [[Wala of Metz|Wala]], the Archbishop of Trier, Bertulf, and Count [[Adalhard II of Metz]] in the [[Battle of Remich]]. The battle was won by the invaders and Bishop Wala fell on the battlefield, alongside many armoured knights and peasants. However, their violent resistance and resultant Viking casualties caused the invaders to turn back, and they retreated north through the Eifel towards their army encampment.&lt;ref&gt;E.

Jahrhundert).'' pp. 273–274.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ceasefire of Ascloha in Spring 882 ==
[[File:Sceau de Charles le gros.jpg|thumb|upright|Coin with image of Charles III]]

After his return from Italy, Emperor [[Charles III of East Francia|Charles III]] held an [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in May 882, and raised a large army, in which [[Franks]], [[Bavarii|Bavarians]], [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabians]], [[Thuringians]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisians]] and [[Lombards]] participated. The army marched up before the fortified Viking camp named in one source as ''Ascloha'' ([[Asselt]] in the ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'', 882).&lt;ref&gt;For identification see also ''The Annals of Fulda,'' edited and translated by Timothy Reuter, Manchester/New York, 1992, p. 92, note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Another contemporary source, however, refers to ''Haslon'' as the place of negotiation, which is often equated with [[Kasteel Elsloo|Elsloo an der Maas]] ([[Regino of Prüm]], ''Chronica'', 882, specifically mentioned in the entry for the year 881).&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen (2004), 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles III besieged the [[Normans]] with his army at a safe distance and, after twelve days, began negotiations with thems. The result was a withdrawal of the invaders who were also paid from the church's goods. On the condition that the Viking leader [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia|Godfrid]] was [[baptism|baptised]], he was given [[Frisia]] as a [[fief]]. The peace agreement was additionally sealed by his [[wedding]] to a Frankish [[princess]]. The princess, [[Gisela of Nivelles|Gisla (Gisela)]] is said to be a daughter of King [[Lothair II]]. The Vikings left behind under the leadership of Sigfrid in Ascloha were initially discouraged from further pillaging by payments of money.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Raid of Summer 882 ==
As early as summer 882, Godfrid returned to the Rhineland with an army reinforced from his homeland for a second raid and devastated Cologne, Bonn and Andernach. Around Andernach, many churches and monasteries were looted and set alight.

[[Zutphen]] on the River [[IJssel]] and nearby [[Deventer]] were also torched during this rampage.&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen (2004), 132-136&lt;/ref&gt; Near Mainz, the Vikings were defeated by an army under [[Count Henry of Babenberg]] and the Archbishop of Mainz, [[Liutbert (archbishop of Mainz)|Liutbert]]. (episcopate 863-889);&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; they probably set fire to Cologne afterwards.

== Raid of Autumn 883 ==
The news of Godfrid's successes in the Rhineland and his acquisition of Frisia attracted other Vikings from Denmark. In autumn 883 they landed in Frisia, rowed up the Rhine with Godfrid's consent and set up camp near Duisburg. Once again, they devastated numerous villages that had just been rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;W. Vogel: ''Die Normannen und das Fränkische Reich bis zur Gründung der Normandie.'' p. 300. &lt;/ref&gt; The people of Cologne had previously strengthened their walls and were spared this time. When the Vikings passed by, Cologne's churches and monasteries were still charred [[ruin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen (2004), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, the Vikings withdrew from the [[Middle Rhine]] and settled permanently on the [[Lower Rhine (region)|Lower Rhine]]. They occupied [[Xanten]] and [[Duisburg]] and made small raids from there into the surrounding area, especially the region of Xanten and the [[Ruhrgebiet]].&lt;ref&gt;J.H.  Withof, A. Blank: ''Chronik der Stadt Duisburg''. p. 118 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=O1pC8wHf9JMC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Chronik+Duisburg+Wikinger&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PCa7UpnkMobCtAaYk4CQCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Chronik%20Duisburg%20Wikinger&amp;f=false online]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== 884 Frankish campaign against the Vikings ==
In 884, a body of troops led by Count Henry [[Popponids|of Babenberg]] succeeded in recapturing Duisburg, and the Vikings withdrew from the rest of the Lower Rhine region in return for more payments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

"'''We begin bombing in five minutes'''" is the last sentence of a controversial, off-the-record joke made by [[president of the United States|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984, during [[Cold War (1979–1985)|the "second Cold War"]].

While preparing for a scheduled radio address from his [[vacation home]] in California, President Reagan joked with those present about illegalizing and bombing the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]].  This joke was not broadcast live, but was recorded and later leaked to the public.  After some brief military confusion, the [[Soviet Union]] denounced the president's joke, as did Reagan's then-opponent in the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 US presidential election]], [[Walter Mondale]].  Reagan's impromptu comments have had significant staying power, being referenced, cited, and used as literary inspiration {{as of|2017|alt=as recently as 2017}}.

The actual address begins with the president announcing his signature on the [[Equal Access Act]]&lt;ref name="1984-08-11 speech" /&gt;, a key plank in [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1984|his reelection campaign]]&lt;ref name="2016-12-22 Rachel Maddow Show" /&gt;: "My fellow Americans: I'm pleased to tell you that today I signed legislation that will allow student religious groups to begin enjoying a right they've too long been denied—the freedom to meet in public high schools during nonschool hours, just as other student groups are allowed to do."&lt;ref name="1984-08-11 speech" /&gt;

It was prior to the speech itself though, while the president was joking with the [[NPR|National Public Radio]] [[audio engineer]]s during [[soundcheck]], that he riffed on his own speech saying, "My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] forever. We begin bombing in five minutes."&lt;ref name="2011-02-07 Deseret News" /&gt;  This sort of jovial pithiness wasn't uncommon for the Ronald Reagan; he was known to interject soundchecks, [[outtake]]s, and [[downtime]] with his humor to raise others' spirits&amp;mdash;in both [[show business]] and [[politics]].&lt;ref name="2017-02-13 Ozy" /&gt;

===Leak===
In the minutes before the president gave his speech, a live feed from [[Rancho del Cielo]] was still being transmitted to radio stations around the United States.  Many rebroadcasters were already recording the feed, and therefore the president's pre-speech joke, to be ready for the official transmission.  While many in the media heard the president's impromptu remarks as he gave them, they were not broadcast live.&lt;ref name="1984-08-14 Guardian" /&gt;

In October 1982, President Reagan had made similarly impolitic remarks about the [[Polish People's Republic]].  As he prepared to announce his cancellation of Poland's [[most favoured nation]] status (in retaliation for supression of the Polish [[trade union]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]), Reagan called the military government "a bunch of no-good, lousy bums."  These recorded comments were aired by "NCB".  As a result of this leak, members of the [[White House Correspondents' Association]] agreed not to publish such unprepared, [[off the record (journalism)|off-the-record]] presidential remarks in the future.&lt;ref name="1984-08-14 Guardian" /&gt;

[[File:Portraits of Assistants to President Ronald Reagan (cropped5).jpg|thumb|[[White House Press Secretary]] [[Larry Speakes]] (September 19, 1983)]]
Both [[CBS News]] and [[CNN|Cable News Network]] recorded the 1984 joke, but kept the president's remarks under wraps in accordance with the White House agreement.  [[Gannett News Service]] "eventually published" the remarks.  Then-[[White House Press Secretary]] [[Larry Speakes]] declined to comment on August 13, saying, "I don’t talk about off-the-record stuff."&lt;ref name="1984-08-14 Guardian" /&gt;

==Reactions==
===Soviet===
&lt;!-- militarily --&gt;The recording of Reagan's joke leaked by August 14, when it became world news.  On August 15, someone who the [[National Security Agency]] described to [[United States House of Representatives|US Representative]] [[Michael D. Barnes]] as "a wayward operator in [[Far Eastern Military District|the Soviet Far Eastern command]]", sent a coded message from [[Vladivostok]] that said, in part, "We now embark on military action against the U.S. forces."  Japanese and [[United States Intelligence Community|US intelligence]] decoded the message and raised the [[alert state]] in that part of the world; [[Soviet Navy|Soviet naval]] vessels in the [[North Pacific]], on the other hand, contacted Vladivostok in confusion.  The US never saw any evidence of Soviet attack preparations, and the alert status as promulgated by Vladivostok was canceled within 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="2016-12-22 Rachel Maddow Show" /&gt;

&lt;!-- poltically --&gt;Initially, on August 13, the deputy minister of [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Soviet foreign affairs]] (Valentin Kamenev) told reporters that, "I have nothing to say."&lt;ref name="1984-08-14 Guardian" /&gt;  By the next day, though, President Reagan's leaked comments were denounced by the [[government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]], ''[[Pravda]]'', ''[[Izvestia]]'', and [[TASS]] as "unprecedentedly hostile", evidencing the United States' insincerety at trying to improve [[Soviet Union–United States relations]], and [[abuse of office|abuse of the office of the president]].  "[[Western world|Western]] [[diplomat]]s" described the Soviet response as over-the-top in an effort to give themselves more collateral at the negotiating table with the US.&lt;ref name="1984-08-16 PPG" /&gt;  US officials were compelled to mollify the [[Soviet Union]] and assure the United States' [[Cold War]] adversary that "Reagan’s offhand remark did not reflect White House policies or U.S. military intentions."&lt;ref name="2010-08-11 Politico" /&gt;

===Domestic===
Reagan's [[opinion poll|poll numbers]] took a hit from the [[political gaffe]], temporarily raising the hopes of [[Walter Mondale]]-supporters in the run-up to the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 US presidential election]].&lt;ref name="2010-08-11 Politico" /&gt;  Mondale said of Reagan's joke, "A President has to be very, very careful with his words."&lt;ref name="1984-08-14 Guardian" /&gt;  Under the analysis of historian [[Craig Shirley]] and [[Ozy (magazine)|''Ozy'']] author Sean Braswell, the leak of Reagan's joke was poorly utilized by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]; "[criticism of the joke] actually worked against the Democrats and for Reagan […] as they came across as hypersensitive, and Reagan as calm, cool and collected."&lt;ref name="2017-02-13 Ozy" /&gt;

&lt;!-- analysis --&gt;Though pessimistically considered just humor in [[taste (sociology)#Bad taste|poor taste]], the private joke had public staying power due to Soviet–Western relations during [[Cold War (1979–1985)|the "second Cold War"]].&lt;ref name="2010-08-11 Politico" /&gt;  In 2011, the ''[[Deseret News]]'' enumerated Reagan's [[microphone gaffe]] as his sixth-best quote, noting the unbelievablility of its leakage only 87 days before the election.&lt;ref name="2011-02-07 Deseret News" /&gt;&lt;!-- COMMENTED AS WP:TRIVIA

A Soviet Union that did not stand-down, and took Reagan's joke as a [[declaration of war by the United States|declaration of]] [[World War III]], is a [[superpower]] in [[Charles Stross]]' [[alternate history]] [[novella]], "[[A Colder War]]".&lt;ref name="2010-08-11 Politico" /&gt; --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2342">The '''Witch of November''', or '''November Witch''', refers to the strong [[winds]] that frequently blow across the [[Great Lakes]] in autumn. The "witches" are caused by intense low [[atmospheric pressure]] over the Great Lakes pulling cold Canadian/Arctic air from the north or northwest and warm Gulf air from the south. When these cold and warm air masses collide, they can result in [[Beaufort scale|hurricane force]] winds that stir up large waves on the lakes.

[[Gordon Lightfoot]]'s song "[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald]]" makes reference to the Witch of November: the storm that wrecked the ''[[SS Edmund Fitzgerald|Edmund Fitzgerald]]'' was 978 mbar,&lt;ref&gt;Storm map [http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mqt/fitzgerald/galesa.php] Accessed 14 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to a borderline [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1/2 hurricane]]. Similar witches have caused numerous shipwrecks over the years. Another storm that hit in November 1998 was 967 mbar,&lt;ref&gt;Storm map [http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mqt/fitzgerald/galesb.php] Accessed 14 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to a solid [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 2|Category 2 hurricane]]. A still stronger storm, of [[October 2010 North American storm complex|October 2010]], brought [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]] record low barometric pressures of, respectively, 954.96 and 961.06 mbar&lt;ref&gt;All-time low pressure records [http://www.kare11.com/weather/weather_article.aspx?storyid=879215&amp;catid=80] Accessed 30 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; (both equivalent to a [[Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale#Category_3|category 3]] hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale) and lashed [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] with 81&amp;nbsp;mph wind gusts&lt;ref&gt;Star Tribune Storm Recap [http://www.startribune.com/local/105859538.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUycaEacyUs] Accessed 27 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and 19-foot seas&lt;ref&gt;NOAA Buoy Data [http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=45006] Accessed 27 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; during the night of October 26–27, 2010.
