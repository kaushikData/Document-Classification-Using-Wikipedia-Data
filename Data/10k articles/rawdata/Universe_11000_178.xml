The '''1991 Perfect Storm''', also known as '''The No-Name Storm''' (especially in the years immediately after it took place) and the '''Halloween Gale/Storm''', was a [[nor'easter]] that absorbed [[Hurricane Grace (1991)|Hurricane Grace]] and ultimately evolved back into a small unnamed [[hurricane]] late in its life cycle. The initial [[low pressure area|area of low pressure]] developed off [[Atlantic Canada]] on October 29. Forced southward by a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its north, it reached its peak intensity as a large and powerful [[cyclone]]. The storm lashed the east coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding before turning to the southwest and weakening. Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a [[subtropical cyclone]] before becoming a tropical storm. It executed a loop off the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] and turned toward the northeast. On November 1, the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane, with peak sustained winds of 75 miles per hour (120&amp;nbsp;km/h), although the [[National Hurricane Center]] left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in the precursor extratropical storm. It later received the name "the Perfect Storm" (playing off the [[perfect storm|common expression]]) after a conversation between Boston [[National Weather Service]] forecaster [[Robert Case]] and author [[Sebastian Junger]]. The system was the twelfth and final tropical cyclone, the eighth tropical storm, and fourth hurricane in the [[1991 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating.

Damage from the storm totaled over $200 million (1991 USD)&lt;ref name="ncdc"&gt;{{cite web|last=McCown|first=Sam|work=National Climatic Data Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=August 20, 2008|title="Perfect Storm" Damage Summary

Most of the damage occurred while the storm was extratropical, after waves up to {{convert|30|ft|m|-1}} struck the coastline from Canada to Florida and southeastward to Puerto Rico. In Massachusetts, where damage was heaviest, over 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged. To the north, more than 100 homes were affected in Maine, including the [[Bush compound|vacation home]] of then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]]. More than 38,000 people were left without power, and along the coast high waves inundated roads and buildings. In portions of New England, the damage was worse than that caused by [[Hurricane Bob]] two months earlier.

Aside from tidal flooding along rivers, the storm's effects were primarily concentrated along the coast. A [[Weather buoy|buoy]] off the coast of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of {{convert|100.7|ft|m}}, the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, the fishing vessel ''[[Andrea Gail]]'' sank, killing her crew of six and inspiring the [[The Perfect Storm (book)|book]], and later [[The Perfect Storm (film)|movie]], ''The Perfect Storm''. Off the shore of New York's [[Long Island]], an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued and one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off [[Staten Island]]. High waves swept two people to their deaths, one in Rhode Island and one in Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.

==Meteorological history==
{{Storm path|1991 Atlantic hurricane 8 track.png|alt=Storm track beginning southeast of Canada as an extratropical storm, moving westward toward New England, becoming tropical as it looped to the northeast, and later dissipating over Prince Edward Island}}
The Perfect Storm originated from a [[cold front]] that exited the east coast of the United States. On October 28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] extended from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on October 29. The cyclone significantly strengthened as a result of the temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity from the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the United States.&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt; It had an unusual retrograde motion for a [[nor'easter]], beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years.&lt;ref name="case"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Oceanographic &amp; Atmospheric Administration News|date=June 16, 2000|title=NOAA Meteorologist Bob Case, the Man Who Named the Perfect Storm|accessdate=July 1, 2011|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s444.htm| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716220940/http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s444.htm| archivedate= July 16, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most nor'easters affect New England from the southwest.&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=October 31, 1991|title=East battered by storm born off Canada; 4 lost|accessdate=July 3, 2011|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Md8cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GGQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6189,8218796&amp;dq=storm+new+england&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Unnamed TS storm 02 nov 1991 1305Z borders.jpg|thumb|right|The tropical storm making landfall west of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, on November 2]]
While situated about {{convert|390|mi|km}} south of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of up to {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="history2"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|title=The Perfect Storm|date=August 20, 2008|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=September 14, 2009|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/satellite/satelliteseye/cyclones/pfctstorm91/pfctstorm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nor'easter reached peak intensity at approximately 12:00 [[UTC]] on October 30 with its lowest pressure of 972 [[millibar]]s. The interaction between the extratropical storm and the high pressure system to its north created a significant pressure gradient, which created large waves and strong winds.&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt; Between the southern New England coast and the storm's center, the gradient was {{convert|70|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="erh"/&gt; A buoy located {{convert|264|mi|km}} south of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] reported a wave height of {{convert|100.7|ft|m}} on October 30. This became the highest recorded wave height on the [[Scotian Shelf]], which is the oceanic [[Continental shelf|shelf]] off the coast of Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name="Environment Canada Perfect Storm"/&gt; East of Cape Cod, a NOAA buoy located at {{Coord|41.1|-66.6}} reported maximum sustained winds of {{convert|56|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} with gusts to {{convert|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and a [[significant wave height]] (average height of the highest one-third of all waves) of {{convert|39|ft|m}} around 15:00 UTC on October 30. Another buoy, located at {{Coord|40.5|-69.5}}, reported maximum sustained winds of {{convert|61|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} with gusts to {{convert|72|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and a significant wave height of {{convert|31|ft|m}} near 00:00 UTC on October 31.&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt;

Upon peaking in intensity, the nor'easter turned southward and gradually weakened; by November 1, its pressure had risen to {{convert|998|mbar|inHg}}. The low moved over warm waters of the [[Gulf Stream]], where [[rainband|bands]] of [[atmospheric convection|convection]] around the center began to organize.&lt;ref name="8 TCR1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Pasch|first=Richard|title=Unnamed Hurricane Preliminary Report Page 1|date=|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=September 14, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1991-prelim/unnamed/prelim01.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the system attained [[subtropical storm|subtropical characteristics]]. On November 1, while the storm was moving in a counter-clockwise loop, a [[tropical cyclone]] had been identified at the center of the larger low.&lt;ref name="history4"&gt;{{Cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|title=Unnamed Hurricane|date=|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=September 14, 2009|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/satellite/satelliteseye/hurricanes/unnamed91/unnamed91.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207192407/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/satellite/satelliteseye/hurricanes/unnamed91/unnamed91.html|archivedate=December 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Although these conditions are rare, [[Hurricane Karl (1980)|Hurricane Karl]] during 1980 formed within a larger non-tropical weather system.)&lt;ref name="MWR"&gt;{{Cite web|first1=Richard |last1=Pasch |first2=Lixion |last2=Avila |title=Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1980 |date=March 26, 1992 |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=September 13, 2009 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1991.pdf |format=PDF |page=2686 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207000313/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1991.pdf |archivedate=December 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By around 14:00 UTC on November 1, an [[eye (cyclone)|eye feature]] was forming, and the tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity with [[maximum sustained winds]] of {{convert|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on}};&lt;ref name="8 TCR2"&gt;{{Cite web|first1=Richard|last1=Pasch|title=Unnamed Hurricane Preliminary Report Page 2|date=|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=September 14, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1991-prelim/unnamed/prelim02.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} these estimates, combined with reports from an Air Force Reserve Unit flight into the storm and confirmation that a [[Tropical cyclone#Mechanics|warm-core]] center was present, indicated that the system had become a Category 1 hurricane on the [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. The hurricane accelerated toward the northeast and quickly weakened back into a tropical storm. It made landfall near Halifax, Nova Scotia, at 14:00 UTC on November 2, with sustained winds of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. While the storm was approaching the coast, weather radars depicted curved rainbands on the western side of the system.&lt;ref name="history4"/&gt; After crossing over [[Prince Edward Island]],&lt;ref name="Environment Canada Perfect Storm"&gt;{{cite web|author=Canadian Hurricane Centre|date=September 14, 2010|title=1991-Unnamed "Perfect Storm"|accessdate=June 17, 2011|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Hurricane/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=B87EB885-1|publisher=Environment Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; the storm fully dissipated late on November 2.&lt;ref name="history4"/&gt;

==Preparations and naming==
[[File:Perfect storm.gif|left|thumb|The Perfect Storm to the south of Nova Scotia on October 30.]]
For several days, [[Numerical weather prediction|weather models]] forecast the development of a significant storm off New England.&lt;ref name="erh"&gt;{{cite web|first=Walter|last=Drag|publisher=Boston National weather Service Office|date=July 14, 2000|title=A comparative retrospective on the Perfect Storm|accessdate=July 1, 2011|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/box/PS.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the models were inadequate in forecasting coastal conditions, which in one instance failed to provide adequate warning. In addition, a post-storm assessment found an insufficient number of observation sites along the coast.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Summary|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=July 1, 2011|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/assessments/pdfs/pstorm1.pdf| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629070922/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/assessments/pdfs/pstorm1.pdf| archivedate= June 29, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 27, the [[Ocean Prediction Center]] noted that a "dangerous storm" would form within 36 hours, with its wording emphasizing the unusual nature of the storm.&lt;ref name="Hoke"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Hoke|work=Oceanic Prediction Center|date=February 16, 2005|title=The Ocean Prediction Center and "The Perfect Storm"|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=July 1, 2011|url=http://www.opc.ncep.noaa.gov/perfectstorm/mpc_ps_intro.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Weather Service]] likewise issued warnings for the potential storm, providing information to emergency service offices as well as the media.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; The public however was skeptical and did not recognize the threat.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; The timely warnings ultimately lowered the death toll;&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; whereas the Perfect Storm caused 13 deaths, the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978|blizzard of 1978]] killed 99 people, and the [[1938 New England hurricane]] killed 564 people.&lt;ref name="erh"/&gt;

From Massachusetts to Maine, thousands of people evacuated their homes and sought shelter.&lt;ref name="ap1031"/&gt; A state of emergency was declared for nine counties in Massachusetts, including [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]], as well as two in Maine.&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; In North Carolina, the National Weather Service offices in [[Hatteras, North Carolina|Hatteras]] and [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] first issued a heavy surf advisory on October 27, more than eight hours before the first reports of high waves. That same day, a [[coastal flood watch]] and later a warning was issued, along with a gale warning. The Hatteras NWS office ultimately released 19 coastal flood statements, as well as media reports explaining the threat from the wind and waves, and a state of emergency was declared for [[Dare County, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="ap1031"&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Rogers|date=October 31, 1991|title=Atlantic Storm Wallops East Coast|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Item|accessdate=July 3, 2011|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7ooiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=F68FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6508,7056631&amp;dq=storm+new+england&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warnings and lead times in the region were described as "very good".&lt;ref name="nc"/&gt;

In Canada, the threat from the storm prompted the cancellation of ferry service from [[Bar Harbor, Maine]], to [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]], as well as from Nova Scotia to Prince Edward Island and between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.&lt;ref name="Environment Canada Perfect Storm"/&gt;

In its [[tropical cyclone report]] on the hurricane, the National Hurricane Center only referred to the system as "Unnamed Hurricane".&lt;ref name="8 TCR1"/&gt; The Natural Disaster Survey Report called the storm "The Halloween Nor'easter of 1991".&lt;ref name="erh"/&gt; The "[[perfect storm]]" moniker was coined by author and journalist [[Sebastian Junger]] after a conversation with NWS Boston Deputy [[Meteorologist]] [[Robert Case]] in which Case described the convergence of weather conditions as being "perfect" for the formation of such a storm.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;  Other National Weather Service offices were tasked with issuing warnings for this storm in lieu of the typical NHC advisories.  The OPC posted warnings on the unnamed hurricane in its ''High Seas Forecasts''.&lt;ref name="Hoke"/&gt; The National Weather Service State Forecast Office in Boston issued ''Offshore Marine Forecasts'' for the storm.  Local NWS offices along the East coast covered the storm in their ''Coastal Waters Forecasts''.&lt;ref name="8 TCR4"&gt;{{Cite web|first1=Richard|last1=Pasch|title=Unnamed Hurricane Preliminary Report Page 4|year=1991|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=June 16, 2011|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1991-prelim/unnamed/prelim04.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1950, the [[National Hurricane Center]] named officially recognized tropical storms and hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane was reported to have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. This was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter, as the hurricane itself was not expected to pose a major threat to land. It was the eighth nameable storm of the [[1991 Atlantic hurricane season]].&lt;ref name="history4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=|title=Canadian Tropical Cyclone Season Summary for 1991|date=July 10, 2009|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|accessdate=September 14, 2009|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=en&amp;n=9D24F0EE-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had the system been named instead, it would have received the name ''Henri'', which was the next name on the 1991 list after Grace.

==Impact==
[[File:Perfect Storm Oceanfront flooding.jpg|thumb|left|Oceanfront flooding in [[Ocean City, New Jersey]]]]
The Halloween Storm of 1991 left significant damage along the east coast of the United States, primarily in [[Massachusetts]] and southern [[New Jersey]]. Across seven states, damage totaled over $200 million (1991 USD).&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; Over a three-day period, the storm lashed the northeastern United States with high waves,&lt;ref name="erh"/&gt; causing damage to beachfront properties from North Carolina to Maine.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; The coastal flooding damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses and closed roads and airports.&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt; In addition, high winds left about 38,000 people without power. The total without power was much less than for Hurricane Bob two months prior, and was fairly low due to little rainfall and the general lack of leaves on trees.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Record-Journal|date=October 31, 1991|title=Wind and water take toll along Connecticut Shore|accessdate=July 3, 2011|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ihxIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rgANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1620,180883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall there were thirteen confirmed deaths,&lt;ref name="erh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Environment Canada Perfect Storm"/&gt; including six on board ''[[Andrea Gail]]'', a swordfishing boat. The vessel departed [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]], for the waters off Nova Scotia. After encountering high seas in the middle of the storm, the vessel made its last radio contact late on October 28, about {{convert|180|mi|km}} northeast of [[Sable Island]]. ''Andrea Gail'' sank while returning to Gloucester, her debris washing ashore over the subsequent weeks. The crew of six was presumed killed after a Coast Guard search was unable to find them. The storm and the boat's sinking became the center-piece for [[Sebastian Junger]]'s best-selling non-fiction book [[The Perfect Storm (book)|''The Perfect Storm'']] (1997), which was adapted to a major Hollywood film in 2000 as [[The Perfect Storm (film)|''The Perfect Storm'']] starring [[George Clooney]].&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paula|last=Park|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=November 11, 1991|title=Search Ended for Lost Fishermen|accessdate=July 3, 2011|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y64cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3HsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6811,330103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the storm's severity, it was neither the costliest nor the strongest to affect the northeastern United States. It was weakening as it made its closest approach to land, and the highest tides occurred during the [[neap tide]], which is the time when tide ranges are minimal.&lt;ref name="erh"/&gt; The worst of the storm effects stayed offshore. A buoy {{convert|650|mi|km}} northeast of [[Nantucket]], which was {{convert|60|mi|km|}} west of ''Andrea Gail''{{'s}} last known position, recorded a {{convert|73|ft|m|abbr=on}} rise in wave height in 10 hours while the extratropical storm was still rapidly intensifying.

After the helicopter had attempted a rescue in the midst of the storm, an 84-person crew on the Coast Guard Cutter ''[[USCGC Tamaroa (WMEC-166)|Tamaroa]]'' arrived and rescued four members of the crew of five after six hours in hypothermic waters. The survivors were pilots Dave Ruvola and Graham Bushor, flight engineer Jim Miolli, and pararescue jumper John Spillane. The fifth member, pararescue jumper Rick Smith, was never found.&lt;ref name="ang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ang.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-091123-012.pdf |title=Surviving The Perfect Storm - Air National Guard |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203104703/http://www.ang.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-091123-012.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were all featured on the show I Shouldn't be Alive.&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=William H. |last=Thiesen |date=November 4, 2010 |title=History – CGC Tamaroa and "The Perfect Storm" |publisher=Coastguard Compass |accessdate=July 3, 2011 |url=http://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2010/11/history-cgc-tamaroa-and-%E2%80%9Cthe-perfect-storm%E2%80%9D/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318054758/http://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2010/11/history-cgc-tamaroa-and-%E2%80%9Cthe-perfect-storm%E2%80%9D/ |archivedate=March 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the storm's damage, President George H. W. Bush declared five [[List of counties in Maine|counties in Maine]], seven [[List of counties in Massachusetts|counties in Massachusetts]], and [[Rockingham County, New Hampshire]] to be disaster areas.&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; The declaration allowed for the affected residents to apply for low-interest repair loans.&lt;ref name="dec"/&gt; New Jersey governor [[Jim Florio]] requested a declaration for portions of the coastline, but the request was denied because of the funding needs of other disasters, such as [[Hurricane Hugo]], Hurricane Bob, and the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]].&lt;ref name="nj"/&gt; The [[American Red Cross]] opened service centers in four locations in Massachusetts to assist the storm victims by providing food, clothing, medicine, and shelter. The agency deployed five vehicles carrying cleanup units and food, and allocated $1.4 million to provide assistance to 3,000 families.&lt;ref name="dec"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer|agency=Associated Press|title=Red Cross Opens Assistance Shelters|date=November 2, 1991|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Sunday Telegraph]]|accessdate=July 3, 2011|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3o5KAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=W5QMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=storm%20new%20england&amp;pg=6685%2C372289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New England and Atlantic Canada===
Along the Massachusetts coastline, the storm produced {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} wave heights on top of a {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} high tide.&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; In [[Boston]], the highest tide was {{convert|14.3|ft|m|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="erh"/&gt; which was only {{convert|1|ft|cm|abbr=on}} lower than the record from the blizzard of 1978.&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; High waves on top of the storm tide reached about {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The storm produced heavy rainfall in southeastern Massachusetts, peaking at {{convert|5.5|in|mm}}.&lt;ref name="erh"/&gt; Coastal floods closed several roads, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. In addition to the high tides, the storm produced strong winds; [[Chatham, Massachusetts|Chatham]] recorded a gust of {{convert|78|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Damage was worst from [[Cape Ann]] in northeastern Massachusetts to Nantucket, with over 100 homes destroyed or severely damaged at [[Marshfield, Massachusetts|Marshfield]], [[North Beach, Massachusetts|North Beach]], and [[Brant Point Light|Brant Point]]. There were two injuries in the state, although there were no fatalities. Across Massachusetts, damage totaled in the hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt;
[[File:Perfect Storm Ocean City.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Street flooding in Ocean City, New Jersey, from the storm]]

Elsewhere in New England, waves up to {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} reached as far north as Maine,&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; along with tides that were {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} above normal.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; Significant flooding was reported in that state, along with high winds that left areas without power. A total of 49 houses were severely damaged, 2 were destroyed,&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; and overall more than 100 were affected.&lt;ref name="maine"&gt;{{cite news|first=William C.|last=Hidlay|date=November 1, 1991|title=Maine hit hard by storm|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|accessdate=July 3, 2011|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DqhJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KQ4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3345,8099&amp;dq=storm+new+england&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kennebunkport, Maine|Kennebunkport]], the storm blew out windows and flooded the vacation home of then-President [[George H.

Along the coast, damage was worse than that caused by Hurricane Bob two months prior.&lt;ref name="maine"/&gt; Across Maine, the storm left $7.9 million (1991 USD) in damage,&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; mostly in [[York County, Maine|York County]].&lt;ref name="maine"/&gt; More than half of the damage total was from property damage, with the remainder to transportation, seawalls, and public facilities.&lt;ref name="maine"/&gt; Although there were no deaths, there were two injuries in the state. In neighboring New Hampshire, coastal flooding affected several towns, destroying two homes. The storm destroyed three boats and damaged a lighthouse.&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; High waves destroyed or swept away over 50,000 lobster traps, representing $2 million in losses (1991 USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer|date=November 2, 1991|title=N.H. lobster industry says it was hit hard|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=July 3, 2011|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3o5KAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=W5QMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2962,372608&amp;dq=storm+new+england&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage was estimated at $5.6 million (1991 USD).&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; Further west, high winds and coastal flooding lashed the Rhode Island and Connecticut coasts, killing a man in [[Narragansett, Rhode Island]]. Winds reached {{convert|63|mph|km/h}} in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], causing power outages.&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt;

Off the coast of Atlantic Canada, the storm produced very high waves, flooding a ship near [[Sable Island]] and stranding another ship. Along the coast, the waves wrecked three small boats near [[Tiverton, Nova Scotia]], as well as nine boats in [[Torbay, Newfoundland and Labrador]]. In Nova Scotia, where the storm made landfall, precipitation reached 1.18 in (30&amp;nbsp;mm), and 20,000 people in [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia|Pictou County]] were left without power. The storm also caused widespread power outages in Newfoundland from its high winds, which reached 68&amp;nbsp;mph (110&amp;nbsp;km/h) near [[St. Lawrence, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Lawrence]]. There were at least 35 traffic accidents, one fatal, in [[Grand Falls-Windsor]] due to slick roads. Prior to the storm's formation, there was a record 4.4 in (116&amp;nbsp;mm) of snowfall across Newfoundland.&lt;ref name="Environment Canada Perfect Storm"/&gt; The storm caused no significant damage in Canada, other than these traffic accidents.&lt;ref name="8 TCR3"&gt;{{Cite web|first1=Richard|last1=Pasch|title=Unnamed Hurricane Preliminary Report Page 3|date=|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=September 14, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1991-prelim/unnamed/prelim03.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-Atlantic states===
[[Image:Halloween storm 30 oct 1991 1226Z.jpg|thumb|right|The cyclone near its closest approach to the United States]]
In New York and northern New Jersey, the storm system left the most coastal damage since the [[1944 Great Atlantic hurricane]]. Numerous boats were damaged or destroyed, killing two people off [[Staten Island]]. High winds swept a man off a bridge, killing him.&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; High waves flooded the beach at [[Coney Island, New York|Coney Island]]. In [[Sea Bright, New Jersey]], waves washed over a seawall, forcing 200 people to evacuate.&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt; Further inland, the [[Hudson River|Hudson]], [[Passaic River|Passaic]], and [[Hackensack River|Hackensack]] rivers experienced tidal flooding.&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt; Outside Massachusetts, damage was heaviest in southern New Jersey, where the cost was estimated at $75 million (1991 USD). Across the area, tide heights reached their highest since the 1944 hurricane, leaving severe coastal and back bay flooding and closing many roads. The storm caused significant beach erosion,&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; with 500,000 [[cubic yard]]s (382,000 cubic meters) lost in [[Avalon, New Jersey|Avalon]], as well as $10 million damage to the beach in [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]]. The presence of a [[dune]] system mitigated the erosion in some areas.&lt;ref name="nj"&gt;{{cite book|first=Margaret|last=Buchholz|author2=Larry Savadove|year=1993|title=Great Storms of the Jersey Shore|publisher=Down the Shore Publishing|isbn=0-945582-51-X|pages=148–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was damage to the [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] Boardwalk.&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt; Fire Island National Seashore was affected, washing away an entire row of waterfront houses in towns like [[Fair Harbor, New York|Fair Harbor]]. Following the storm, there was a [[moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on clamming in the state's bays, due to contaminated waters.&lt;ref name="nj"/&gt; Along the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], there was widespread water damage to homes, including ten affected houses in [[Sandbridge Beach]], Virginia. Tides in [[Ocean City, Maryland]], reached a record height of {{convert|7.8|ft|m|abbr=on}}, while elsewhere the tides were similar to the [[Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962]].&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt;

===Farther south===
In North Carolina along the [[Outer Banks]], high waves were initially caused by Hurricane Grace and later its interaction with a high pressure system. This produced gale-force winds and {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} waves in the town of [[Duck, North Carolina|Duck]]. Later, the extratropical predecessor to the unnamed hurricane produced additional high waves, causing oceanfront flooding from [[Cape Hatteras]] through the northern portions of [[Currituck County, North Carolina|Currituck County]]. Flooding was first reported on October 28, when the ocean covered a portion of [[North Carolina Highway 12]] north of [[Rodanthe, North Carolina|Rodanthe]];&lt;ref name="nc"/&gt; the route is the primary thoroughfare in the Outer Banks.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; [[Nags Head, North Carolina|Nags Head]], [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]], and [[Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina|Kill Devil Hills]] had large portions covered with water for several blocks away from the beach. The resultant flooding damaged 525 houses and 28 businesses and destroyed two motels and a few homes.&lt;ref name="nc"&gt;{{cite web|first=Joseph|last=Pelissier|year=1991|title=North Carolina Coastal Flood|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=June 16, 2011|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1991/unnamed/preloc/ncflood1.gif|format=GIF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage was estimated at $6.7 million (1991 USD).&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; Farther south, the storm left 14 people injured in Florida. There was minor beach erosion and flooding, which damaged two houses and destroyed the pier at [[Lake Worth, Florida|Lake Worth]].&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; In some locations, beaches gained additional sand from the wave action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Carl|last=Herzog|date=November 2, 1991|title=Erosion is a sampling of hurricane's potential|newspaper=Boca Raton News|accessdate=July 3, 2011|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tvVTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=z4wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6423,469152&amp;dq=storm+new+england&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two people went missing off [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] after their boat lost power.&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt; High waves destroyed a portion of [[Florida State Road A1A|State Road A1A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer|newspaper=The News-Journal|date=November 1, 1991|title=Wintry blast sends snow into Texas|accessdate=July 3, 2011|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Iw8qAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rNQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3703,111342&amp;dq=storm+new+england&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage in the state was estimated at $3 million (1991 USD).&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; High waves also affected Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt; In Puerto Rico, waves of {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} affected the island's north coast, which prompted 32 people to seek shelter. The waves swept a person off a large rock to his death.&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt;

{{italic title}}
The '''''AOS Checklist of North American Birds''''' is a checklist of the bird species found in [[North America|North]] and [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]] which is now maintained by the [[American Ornithological Society]] (AOS). The checklist was originally published by the AOS's predecessor, the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU). The Union merged with the [[Cooper Ornithological Society]] in 2016 to form the American Ornithological Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=AOU History | url=http://www.americanornithology.org/content/aou-history | publisher=American Ornithological Society | accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The checklist was first published in 1886;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=1886 | title=The Code of Nomenclature and Check-list of North American Birds Adopted by the American Ornithologists' Union | publisher =American Ornithologists' Union | place=New York | doi=10.5962/bhl.title.1538 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; the seventh edition of the checklist was published in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Checklist of North American Birds |year=1998 |publisher=American Ornithologists' Union |location=New York, US |isbn=1-891276-00-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now updated every year by an [[Open access journal|open-access]] article published in the ''[[The Ibis|Ibis]]''.&lt;ref name=checklist&gt;{{cite web | title=Checklist of North and Middle American Birds | publisher=American Ornithological Society | url=http://www.americanornithology.org/content/checklist-north-and-middle-american-birds | accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven editions and 54 supplements (minor updates) have been published in the last 127 years. According to [[Joel Asaph Allen]], the Codes of Nomenclature set out in the first edition of the Checklist "later became the basis of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], framed on essentially the same lines and departing from it in no essential respect, except in point of brevity, through omission of adequate illustrations of the rules, and thereby rendering necessary the issuance of official 'Opinions' to clear up obscure points."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Joel Asaph |year=1916 | title=Autobiographical notes and a bibliography of the scientific publications of Joel Asaph Allen | page=40 | publisher=[[American Museum of Natural History]] |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/44824381 |doi=10.5962/bhl.title.82666 | doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current version of the checklist is available online from the website of the American Ornithological Society.&lt;ref name=checklist/&gt; The list is updated regularly by the AOS's North American Classification Committee (NACC), which considers proposals related to [[Biological classification|classification]] and [[Binomial nomenclature|nomenclature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Checklist of North and Middle American Birds: Current Proposals | url=http://checklist.aou.org/nacc/proposals/current_proposals.html | publisher=American Ornithological Society | accessdate=22 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Checklist of North and Middle American Birds: Previous Proposals | url=http://checklist.aou.org/nacc/proposals/prior_proposals.html | publisher=American Ornithological Society | accessdate=22 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ali Akbar Salehi''' ({{lang-fa|علی‌اکبر صالحی}}, {{Audio-IPA|Ali Akbar Salehi from Iran pronunciation.ogg|pronunciation}}; born 24 March 1949) is an Iranian academic, diplomat and the head of [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran]]. He served as head of AEOI from 2009 to 2010 and was appointed to the post for a second time on 16 August 2013. Before his appointment of his current position, he was [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran|foreign affairs minister]] from 2010 to 2013.  He was also the Iranian representative in the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] from 1998 to 2003.

==Early life and education==
Salehi was born in [[Karbala]], [[Iraq]], on 24 March 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/01/irans-new-foreign-minister-ali-akbar-salehi.html|title=Iran's New Foreign Minister: Ali Akbar Salehi|date=31 January 2011|accessdate=15 May 2012|work=[[PBS]]|first=Mehrzhad|last=Boroujerdi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a bachelor of science degree in physics from the [[American University of Beirut]] in 1971 and a PhD in [[nuclear engineering]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=tavana&gt;{{cite news|title=The Man to Watch in Iran?|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/12/dispatch-ali-akbar-salehi-irans-foreign-minister-and-future-president.html|accessdate=10 February 2013|work=PBS|date=1 December 2011|author=Kambiz Tavana|author2=Arash Karami}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=irna13/&gt;&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/16333&lt;/ref&gt; Salehi is fluent in [[English Language|English]] and [[Arabic Language|Arabic]], in addition to his native [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://backchannel.al-monitor.com/index.php/2012/05/314/qa-with-david-albright-if-iran-comes-clean-on-weaponization-other-things-can-be-solved-much-more-easily/]&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as the chancellor of the [[Sharif University of Technology]]&lt;ref name=tavana/&gt; from 1982 to 1985 and once again from 1989 to 1993. While chancellor, Salehi was involved in an attempt to obtain [[dual-use]] technologies from a European supplier, according to [[David Albright]] of the [[Institute for Science and International Security]], citing some 1,600 [[telex]] documents from the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/IranianThreat/News/Article.aspx?id=270144|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=16 May 2012|accessdate=15 May 2012|title=US nuclear expert: Iranian FM Salehi linked to past program}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also chancellor of [[Imam Khomeini International University]] for two years (1988&amp;ndash;1989).

An ISIS ([[Institute for Science and International Security]]) report claims the Physics Research Center acted as a front in the late 1980s and early 1990s to obtain illicit nuclear technologies. ISIS claims that, as head of Sharif University, was aware of purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/15/us-iran-nuclear-usa-idUSBRE84E1O720120515|title=U.S. nuclear expert: Iran official linked to past program|work=Reuters|date=15 May 2012|accessdate=15 May 2012|last=Zakaria|first=Tabassum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salehi was appointed as permanent representative of Iran to [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] by [[President of Iran|the then president]] [[Mohammad Khatami]] on 13 March 1997 and remained in the post until 22 August 2005. On 18 December 2003, Salehi signed the [[Additional Protocol]] to the safeguard agreement, on behalf of Iran. He was replaced by [[Pirooz Hosseini]].

Salehi was deputy secretary-general of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] under [[Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu]] from 2007 to 2009. He resigned on 16 July 2009 when then President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] appointed Salehi as the new head of [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran|Iran's Atomic Energy Organization]], replacing [[Gholam Reza Aghazadeh]] who resigned on 10 July. Salehi resigned from office on 23 January 2011 when Ahmadinejad nominated him as foreign minister.

On 13 December 2010, Ahmadinejad dismissed [[Manouchehr Mottaki]] for unknown reasons and appointed Salehi in an acting capacity.&lt;ref name=michaelt&gt;{{cite news|last=Theodoulou|first=Michael|title=Ahmadinejad fires foreign minister on overseas trip|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/ahmadinejad-fires-foreign-minister-on-overseas-trip|accessdate=21 January 2013|newspaper=The National|date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 January 2011, Ahmadinejad nominated Salehi to become foreign minister.

'''α-Parinaric acid''' is a [[conjugated fatty acid|conjugated]] polyunsaturated [[fatty acid]]. Discovered by Tsujimoto and Koyanagi in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;Tsujimoto M, Koyanagi H. (1933). New unsaturated acid in the kernel oil of "akarittom", "Parinarium laurinum". I. ''Kogyo Kagaku Zasshi'' '''36''' (Suppl): 110–113.&lt;/ref&gt; it contains 18 carbon atoms and 4 [[conjugated system|conjugated]] double bonds. The repeating [[single bond]]-[[double bond]] structure of α-parinaric acid distinguishes it structurally and chemically from the usual "methylene-interrupted" arrangement of [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s that have double-bonds and single bonds separated by a [[methylene bridge|methylene unit]] (−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−). Because of the [[fluorescent]] properties conferred by the alternating double bonds, α-parinaric acid is commonly used as a molecular probe in the study of [[biological membranes|biomembranes]].

==Natural sources==
α-Parinaric acid occurs naturally in the seeds of the [[Atuna racemosa racemosa|makita tree]] (''Parinari laurina''), a tree found in [[Fiji]] and other [[Pacific islands]].  Makita seeds contain about 46% α-parinaric acid, 34% α-eleostearic acid as major components, with lesser amounts of [[saturated fatty acid]]s, [[oleic acid]] and [[linoleic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilditch TP et al. (1964). ''The Chemical Constitution of Natural Fats, Fourth Edition.''  pg.  253.&lt;/ref&gt; α-Parinaric acid is also found in the seed oil of ''[[Impatiens balsamina]]'', a member of the family ''[[Balsaminaceae]]''. The major fatty acids of ''[[Impatiens balsamina]]'' are 4.7% [[palmitic acid]], 5.8% [[stearic acid]], 2.8% [[arachidic acid]], 18.3% oleic acid, 9.2% linoleic acid, 30.1% linolenic acid and 29.1% α-parinaric acid.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8342-1342-7"&gt;{{cite book |author =Gunstone F.D.|title=Fatty Acid and Lipid Chemistry|publisher=Springer Verlag |location=Berlin |year=1996 |page=10 |isbn=0-8342-1342-7|oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also present in the [[fungus]] ''[[Clavulina cristata]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Endo S, Zhiping G, Takagi T. (1991). Lipid components of seven species of Basidiomycotina and three species of Ascomycotina. ''Journal of the Japan Oil Chemists' Society'' '''40'''(7): 574&amp;ndash;577.&lt;/ref&gt; and the plant ''Sebastiana brasiliensis'' (family [[Euphorbiaceae]]).&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer V, Tomberg W, Zucolotto M. (1996). Identification of alpha-parinaric acid in the seed oil of ''Sebastiana brasiliensis'' Sprengel (Euphorbiaceae). ''Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society'' '''73'''(5): 569&amp;ndash;573.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==

===Biosynthesis===
The biochemical mechanism by which α-parinaric acid is formed in the plant ''[[Impatiens balsamina]]'' was elaborated using techniques of [[molecular biology]]. The enzyme responsible for the creation of the conjugated double bonds was identified using [[expressed sequence tag]]s, and called a "conjugase". This enzyme is related to the family of fatty acid [[desaturase]] enzymes responsible for putting double bonds into fatty acids.&lt;ref name="pmid10536026"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Cahoon EB, Carlson TJ, Ripp KG, Schweiger BJ, Cook GA, Hall SE, Kinney AJ |title=Biosynthetic origin of conjugated double bonds: production of fatty acid components of high-value drying oils in transgenic soybean embryos |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=96 |issue=22 |pages=12935–40 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10536026 |pmc=23170 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.96.22.12935|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10536026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical synthesis===

α-Parinaric acid may be [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] chemically using α-[[linoleic acid]] as a starting compound. This synthesis enables the transformation of 1,4,7-octatriene methylene-interrupted ''cis'' double bonds of naturally occurring polyunsaturated fatty acids to 1,3,5,7-octatetraenes in high yield.&lt;ref name="pmid15351273"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Kuklev DV, Smith WL |title=Synthesis of four isomers of parinaric acid |journal=Chem.

==Uses==

===Membrane probes===
Both the alpha and beta (all ''trans'') isomers of parinaric acid are used as molecular probes of lipid-lipid interactions, by monitoring [[phase transition]]s in bilayer lipid membranes.&lt;ref name="pmid1057769"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Sklar LA, Hudson BS, Simoni RD |title=Conjugated polyene fatty acids as membrane probes: preliminary characterization |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=1649–53 |date=May 1975 |pmid=1057769 |pmc=432600 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.72.5.1649|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; α-Parinaric acid was shown to integrate normally into the [[lipid bilayer|phospholipid bilayer]] of mammalian cells,&lt;ref name="pmid914848"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Rintoul DA, Simoni RD |title=Incorporation of a naturally occurring fluorescent fatty acid into lipids of cultured mammalian cells |journal=J.

Biophys. Acta |volume=736 |issue=1 |pages=79–91 |date=December 1983 |pmid=6580918 |doi= 10.1016/0005-2736(83)90172-4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0005-2736(83)90172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; with minimal effects on the [[biophysical]] properties of the membrane. Molecular interactions with neighboring membrane lipids will affect the fluorescence of α-parinaric acid in predictable ways, and the subsequent subtle changes in energy intensities may be measured [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]].

Researchers have put α-parinaric to good use in the study of membrane biophysics. For example, it was used to help establish the existence of a "fluidity gradient" across the membrane bilayer of some [[tumor cell]]s ― the inner monolayer of the membrane is less fluid than the outer monolayer.&lt;ref name="pmid723938"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Schroeder F|title=Differences in fluidity between bilayer halves of tumour cell plasma membranes |journal=Nature |volume=276 |issue=5687 |pages=528–30|date=November 1978 |pmid=723938 |doi= 10.1038/276528a0|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lipid-protein interactions===
α-Parinaric acid is also used as a [[chromophore]] to study interactions between membrane proteins and lipids. Because of the similarity of α-parinaric acid to normal membrane lipids, it has minimal perturbing influence.&lt;ref name="pmid911814"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Sklar LA, Hudson BS, Simoni RD |title=Conjugated polyene fatty acids as fluorescent probes: binding to bovine serum albumin |journal=Biochemistry |volume=16 |issue=23 |pages=5100–8 |date=November 1977 |pmid=911814 |doi= 10.1021/bi00642a024|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By measuring shifts in the [[absorption spectrum]], enhancement of α-parinaric acid [[fluorescence]], induced [[circular dichroism]], and energy transfer between [[tryptophan]] amino acids in the protein and the bound chromophore, information may be gleaned about the molecular interactions between protein and lipid.&lt;ref name="pmid911814"/&gt; For example, this technique is used to investigate how fatty acids bind to [[serum albumin]] (a highly abundant blood protein),&lt;ref name="pmid216673"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Berde CB, Hudson BS, Simoni RD, Sklar LA |title=Human serum albumin.

==Cytotoxic effects on tumor cells==

α-Parinaric acid is [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] to human [[leukemia]] cells in [[cell culture]] at concentrations of 5 [[Micromolar#Molarity|μM]] or less, by sensitizing the tumor cells to [[lipid peroxidation]], the process where [[free radical]]s react with electrons from cell membrane lipids, resulting in cell damage.&lt;ref name="pmid1933865"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Cornelius AS, Yerram NR, Kratz DA, Spector AA |title=Cytotoxic effect of ''cis''-parinaric acid in cultured malignant cells |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=51 |issue=22 |pages=6025–30 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1933865 |doi= |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1933865}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similarly cytotoxic to malignant [[glioma]]s grown in cell culture.&lt;ref name="pmid7501114"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Traynelis VC, Ryken TC, Cornelius AS |title=Cytotoxicity of ''cis''-parinaric acid in cultured malignant gliomas |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=484–9 |date=September 1995 |pmid=7501114 |doi= 10.1097/00006123-199509000-00017|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0148-396X&amp;volume=37&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal (non-tumorous) [[astrocyte]]s grown in culture are far less sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of α-parinaric acid.&lt;ref name="pmid7501114" /&gt; This preferential toxicity towards tumor cells is due to a differential regulation of [[c-Jun N-terminal kinases|c-Jun N-terminal kinase]], and [[FOX proteins|forkhead transcription factors]] between malignant and normal cells.&lt;ref name="pmid17160503"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Zaheer A, Sahu SK, Ryken TC, Traynelis VC |title=''Cis''-parinaric acid effects, cytotoxicity, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase, forkhead transcription factor and Mn-SOD differentially in malignant and normal astrocytes |journal=Neurochem.

An '''aluminide''' is a compound that has [[aluminium]] with more [[electropositive]] elements. Since aluminium is near the [[nonmetal]]s on the periodic table, it can bond with metals differently from other metals. The properties of an aluminide would be intermediate between a metal alloy and an ionic compound.

==Examples==
* [[Magnesium aluminide]], MgAl
* [[Titanium aluminide]], TiAl
* [[Iron aluminide]], Fe3Al - a substitute for stainless steel
* [[Nickel aluminide]], Ni3Al

'''''Bringing Back the Bluestones''''' is a stage play by Derek Webb about a pressure group from [[Pembrokeshire]] campaigning to have the [[Stonehenge]] [[bluestone]]s returned to Wales. It followed the fortunes of Roy Brown as he sets up the group, Carreg Las ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] for "Blue Stone"), and campaigns for the return of the stones to the [[Preseli Hills]].

==History==
The play began as a short radio play by Derek Webb, but was developed into a stage play in 2002. The original production caused a sensation in Wales when the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' (a leading Welsh newspaper) carried an article reporting the premise the play was based on as true.&lt;ref&gt;''Western Mail'', 23 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that Carreg Las had argued that since Greece wanted the [[Elgin Marbles]] back, Wales should be able to lay claim to the Bluestones. The ''Western Mail'' ran a front page article, a leader column comment, and devoted a full colour half page to the story. Eminent historians and politicians were consulted. A spokesperson for [[English Heritage]], which looks after Stonehenge, reportedly "almost choked when asked about the possibility of dismantling Stonehenge". The story was subsequently taken up by other newspapers and radio stations throughout Wales and in [[Wiltshire]]. However, it turned out that the creation of Carreg Las was a spoof designed to generate publicity for the play. 

==Other developments==
In 2004, a few years after the first production, ''British Archaeology '' carried the following story: 
{{Quote|[[Robyn Lewis|Dr Robin Lewis]], [[Archdruid]] of the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards, wrote to the ''Daily Telegraph'': "Since the [[Stone of Scone]] was returned to Scotland a few years since, and it is clearly only a matter of time until the Elgin Marbles are returned to Greece, may I express a request that Stonehenge be returned to Wales?" Dr Lewis's appeal, made "on behalf of my fellow druids, bards and the rest of my Welsh compatriots", is not without precedent. Welsh pressure group Carreg Glas made a similar claim on Stonehenge in 2002, which turned out to be a prank to publicise a play called ''Bringing Back the Bluestones'' by Derek Webb. Carreg Glas' mad scheme won real-life supporters, so perhaps Archdruid Lewis' voice won’t be a lone one.&lt;ref&gt;''British Archaeology'' Issue 78 September 2004, ISSN 1357-4442.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
The story was also reported by the ''Milford Mercury''&lt;ref&gt;''Milford Mercury'' newspaper dated Friday 25 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3830547.stm Archdruid wants Stonehenge back] BBC, 22 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent adaptations==
The play was rewritten in 2010 for a performance by Fluellen Theatre Company at the [[Swansea Grand Theatre]], as part of their Lunchtime Theatre programme.  This new 1-act version subsequently transferred to deValence in Tenby and on to [[Theatr Gwaun]] in Fishguard where it attracted record audiences.  The main character in the play, Roy Brown, has subsequently been developed in a further comedy entitled ''Roy Brown: Untitled'' in which Roy sees modern art as a way of making quick money and turns out a number of "artworks" in quick succession.  The play was premiered in 2010 at Swansea's Grand Theatre. Webb is the author of several other plays which have been premiered at the theatre.  His most recent play was commemorating the 100th anniversary of the first flight from the UK to Ireland by [[Denys Corbett Wilson]] in April 1912.

'''Capital Power Income L.P.''' was a limited partnership that owned power generation assets in Canada and the United States.

Founded as '''TransCanada Power L.P.''' the company was renamed '''EPCOR Power L.P.''' after [[TransCanada Corporation]] sold its interest in the partnership to [[EPCOR Utilities Incorporated]] on September 1, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.transcanada.com/power/powerlp.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527061133/http://www.transcanada.com/power/powerlp.html |archive-date=2011-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then renamed on November 5, 2009 to reflect the transfer of ownership from EPCOR Utilities to its newly created spin-off [[Capital Power Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/November2009/05/c5359.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2146">The '''Coal Industry Commission Act 1919''' (c 1) was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom]], which set up a commission, led by [[Mr Justice Sankey]] (and so known as the "Sankey Commission"), to consider joint management or [[nationalisation]] of the coal mines. It also considered the issues of working conditions, wage and hours.

==Background==
A [[Royal Commission]], led by [[John Sankey, 1st Viscount Sankey|Sir John Sankey]], was called to examine the future of the mining industry. [[Leo Chiozza Money]], [[Sidney Webb]] and [[R.H. Tawney]] were the three economists on the commission, all broadly favourable to the miners. Others were appointed from business and the trade unions.

No agreement was reached and, when the commission reported in June 1919, it offered four separate approaches ranging from full [[nationalisation]] to untrammelled private ownership.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor (1965) ''The Oxford History of England: English History 1914-1945''. The public impact of the report was such that, in [[Ben Travers]]' comic novel ''[[A Cuckoo in the Nest]]'' (1921), the Rev. Cathcart Sloley-Jones, under the illusion that he was addressing a Member of Parliament, "lowered his voice into a rather sinister whisper: 'What is Lloyd George's real view of the miners' report?'"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissioners==
*[[Mr Justice Sankey]], chairman recommended nationalisation
*[[Frank Hodges (trade unionist)|Frank Hodges]], recommended nationalisation
*[[Leo Chiozza Money]]
*[[Robert Smillie]]
*[[Herbert Smith (trade unionist)|Herbert Smith]]

The '''coal industry in Wales''' has played an important role in the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[Wales]]. Coal mining expanded in the eighteenth century to provide fuel for the [[blast furnace]]s of the iron and copper industries that were expanding in [[South Wales]]. The industry had reached large proportions by the end of that century, and then further expanded to supply steam-coal for the [[steamship|steam vessels]] that were beginning to trade around the world. The [[Coal Exchange|Cardiff Coal Exchange]] set the world price for steam-coal and Cardiff became a major coal-exporting port. The [[South Wales Coalfield]] was at its peak in 1913 and was one of the largest coalfields in the world. It remained the largest coalfield in Britain until 1925.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite book |author=Hughes, Stephen R. |title=Collieries of Wales: Engineering and Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AHp8K45uCmwC&amp;pg=PA8 |year=1994 |publisher=[[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]] |location=Aberystwyth |isbn=978-1-871184-11-2 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supply of coal dwindled, and pits closed in spite of a [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|UK-wide strike against closures]]. The last deep mine in Wales, [[Tower Colliery]], closed in 2008, after thirteen years as a [[Cooperative|co-operative]] owned by its miners.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7200432.stm | title=Coal mine closes with celebration | accessdate=4 March 2016 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The South Wales Coalfield was not the only coal mining area of the country. There was a sizeable industry in [[Flintshire]] and [[Denbighshire]] in [[North East Wales|northeast Wales]], and coal was also mined in [[Anglesey]].&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

The [[South Wales Coalfield]] extends from parts of [[Pembrokeshire]] and [[Carmarthenshire]] in the west, through [[Swansea]], [[Neath Port Talbot]], [[Bridgend County Borough]], [[Rhondda Cynon Taf]], [[Merthyr Tydfil]], [[Caerphilly County Borough]] and [[Blaenau Gwent]] to [[Torfaen]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Wales (geological map)|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/South-Wales-map-1300.jpg|work=Geological Maps of Selected British Regions|publisher=[[Southampton University]]|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rocks comprising this area were laid down during the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Upper Carboniferous]] era. At that time warm seas invaded much of southern and northeastern Wales, coral reefs flourished and were laid down as limestone deposits. In South Wales particularly, extensive swamps developed where tree-size [[Lycopodiopsida|clubmosses]] and [[fern]]s grew. The decay of this vegetation as it died formed peat which became buried over the ensuing millennia by other sediments. Over long periods of time, the peat was consolidated and converted by the pressure of overlying layers into seams of coal. Although thinner than the original peat layers, some of the coal deposits in South Wales are of great thickness.&lt;ref name=Underground&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wales-underground.org.uk/geo.shtml |title=Environmental Change and Mineral Formation in Wales |work=Wales Underground |accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Denbighshire Coalfield extends from near [[Caergwrle]] in the north, to [[Wrexham]], [[Ruabon]], [[Rhosllannerchrugog]] and [[Chirk]] in the south, a small part extending into [[Shropshire]] in the [[Oswestry]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Geological Survey]], 2007 ''Bedrock Geology: UK South'', 1:625,000 scale geological map (5th edn), BGS, Keyworth, Notts&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel in the earth's crust and has a long history of being exploited. Archaeological evidence shows that it was burned in funeral pyres in Wales during the [[Bronze Age]] and cinders have been found in [[Roman Britain|Roman settlements in Britain]]. Originally the coal would have come from outcropping coal seams, and from lumps of sea coal gathered from the foreshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/technology/coal-mining |title=Coal mining |author=Ramani, Raja Venkat |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the seventeenth century, coal was being dug from shallow deposits for local use and by the beginning of the eighteenth century, a trade in coal was developing along the coast from such areas as Pembrokeshire, Llanelli and Swansea Bay. As surface deposits were exhausted by opencast mining, shallow pits were dug, and later [[bell pit]]s, with more coal being extracted from short galleries. Soon, horizontal shafts were being dug into the hillsides and barrows manoeuvred along wooden tracks.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], Wales was at the forefront of the development of new technologies for the mining industry.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt; These innovations included the use of water power for winding gear, the provision of mine ventilation, the use of steam engines for both winding and pumping and the use of underground tramways and canals for transport. Welsh mine-owners pioneered the use of horse-drawn and later steam railways to transport coal to the docks. The transfer from wood to coal as fuel that occurred during the Industrial Revolution was heavily influenced by Welsh innovations.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

The land under which coal could be found was generally in private ownership. [[John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute]] was a large landowner in South Wales and developed the coal and iron industries in Glamorganshire in the nineteenth century. Agriculture ceased to be the main source of employment in the county as mining and other industries came to the fore, and he transformed his South Wales estates into a major industrial enterprise. He commissioned surveys in 1817 and again in 1823 to 1824 which showed huge reserves of coal under his land. He sold some outlying parts of his estate in order to purchase other potentially more-productive areas, and claimed rights to minerals under certain [[common land]]s through his feudal titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Davies | first=John | year=1981 | title=Cardiff and the Marquesses of Bute |location=Cardiff | publisher=[[University of Wales Press]]| isbn= 9780708324639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- For page numbers see his article --&gt;

Lord Bute was one of the main forces behind the development of [[Cardiff Docks]] for the export of coal and iron from South Wales. By 1840, the network of canals and railways enabled 4.5 million tons of coal to be mined and transported. Of this, about half was used by the steel industry, about 750,000 tons went for export and the rest was used for other industrial and domestic use. By 1854, coal production had nearly doubled, and 2.5 million tons was being exported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Industry: 19th century coal mining |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/industry_coal02.shtml |newspaper=[[BBC Wales]] |date=15 August 2008 |accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Wales, the Flintshire manors of [[Ewloe]], [[Hopedale, Flintshire|Hopedale]], and [[Mostyn]] and the Denbighshire manor of [[Brymbo]] were reported to be making profits from trading coal during the 14th and 15th centuries. By 1593, coal was being exported from ports on the Dee Estuary. The trade developed swiftly and by 1616, the principle collieries were at [[Bagillt]], [[Tegeingl|Englefield]], [[Leaderbrook]], Mostyn, [[Uphfytton]] and [[Connah's Quay|Wepre]].&lt;ref name=nwales/&gt; Most mines were horizontal [[adit]]s or shallow [[bell pit]]s, though a few were becoming sufficiently large to have accumulations of water and ventilation problems.&lt;ref name=FHS&gt;{{cite journal |year=1971–1972 |title=The growth and development of settlement and population in Flintshire, 1801–1851 |journal=Flintshire Historical Society publications |volume=25 |url=http://welshjournals.llgc.org.uk/browse/viewpage/llgc-id:1256711/llgc-id:1259972/llgc-id:1260057/getText }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational anatomy''' is an interdisciplinary field of [[biology]] focused on quantitative investigation and modelling of anatomical shapes variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://team.inria.fr/asclepios/research/computational-anatomy/|title=Computational Anatomy – Asclepios|website=team.inria.fr|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icm.jhu.edu/research-areas-2/computational-anatomy/|title=JHU – Institute for Computational Medicine {{!}}   Computational Anatomy|website=icm.jhu.edu|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the development and application of mathematical, statistical and data-analytical methods for modelling and simulation of biological structures.

The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in [[anatomy]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[pure mathematics]], [[machine learning]], [[computational mechanics]], [[computational science]], [[biological imaging]], [[neuroscience]], [[physics]], [[probability]], and [[statistics]]; it also has strong connections with [[fluid mechanics]] and [[geometric mechanics]]. Additionally, it complements newer, interdisciplinary fields like [[bioinformatics]] and [[neuroinformatics]] in the sense that its interpretation uses metadata derived from the original sensor imaging modalities (of which [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] is one example). It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. It is similar in spirit to the history of [[Computational linguistics]], a discipline that focuses on the linguistic structures rather than the [[sensor]] acting as the [[transmission medium|transmission]] and communication medium(s).

In computational anatomy, the [[diffeomorphism]] group is used to study different coordinate systems via [[change of basis|coordinate transformations]] as generated via the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian velocities of flow]] in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Computational anatomy#Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms|flows between coordinates in Computational anatomy]] are constrained to be [[Computational anatomy#The Metric on geodesic flows of landmarks, surfaces, and volumes within the orbit|geodesic flows]] satisfying [[Computational anatomy#The action integral for Hamilton's principle on diffeomorphic flows|the principle of least action for the Kinetic energy of the flow]]. The kinetic energy is defined through a [[Computational anatomy#The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space|Sobolev smoothness]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; norm with strictly more than two generalized, [[square-integrable function|square-integrable]] derivatives for each component of the flow velocity, which guarantees that the flows in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; are diffeomorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Variational Problems on Flows of Diffeomorphisms for Image Matching|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2693614|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-02-20|last = Dupuis|first = Paul|authorlink = |last2 = Grenander|first2 = Ulf|authorlink2 = |others = |authorlink3 = |last3 = Miller, Michael|author-first# = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It also implies that the [[Computational anatomy#The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space|diffeomorphic shape momentum]] taken pointwise satisfying the [[Computational anatomy#The Euler–Lagrange equation on shape momentum for geodesics on the group of diffeomorphisms|Euler-Lagrange equation for geodesics]] is determined by its neighbors through spatial derivatives on the velocity field.  This separates the discipline from the case of [[Incompressible flow|incompressible fluids]]&lt;ref name=MR202082&gt;{{Cite journal |mr=202082 |title=Sur la géomérie différentielle des groupes de Lie de dimension infinie et ses applications à l'hydrodynamique des fluides parfaits |journal= Ann.

Computational anatomy intersects the study of [[Riemannian manifolds]] and nonlinear [[global analysis]], where groups of diffeomorphisms are the central focus. Emerging high-dimensional theories of shape&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Laurent Younes |title = Shapes and Diffeomorphisms |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783642120541|date=2010-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are central to many studies in Computational anatomy, as are questions emerging from the fledgling field of [[shape statistics]].
The metric structures in Computational anatomy are related in spirit to [[morphometrics]], with the distinction that Computational anatomy focuses on an infinite-dimensional space of [[coordinate system]]s transformed by a [[diffeomorphism]], hence the central use of the terminology [[#Diffeomorphometry: The Metric Space of Shapes and Forms|'''diffeomorphometry''']], the metric space study of coordinate systems via diffeomorphisms.

==Genesis==
At Computational anatomy's heart is the comparison of shape by recognizing in one shape the other. This connects it to [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]]'s developments [[On Growth and Form]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;which has led to scientific explanations of [[morphogenesis]], the process by which [[patterns]] are formed in [[Biology]]. [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Durer]]'s Four Books on Human Proportion were arguably the earliest works on Computational anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure|title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion durch Albrechten Durer von Nurerberg [sic.] erfunden und beschuben zu nutz allen denen so zu diser kunst lieb tragen|last=Durer|first=Albrecht|year=1528|publisher=Hieronymus Andreae Formschneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.uthscsa.edu/2012/03/albrecht-durers-human-proportions/|title=Albrecht Dürer's Human Proportions "  UT Health Science Center Library|last=Library|first=State of Texas, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio|website=library.uthscsa.edu|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themorgan.org/collection/printed-books-and-bindings/73192|title=Albrecht Dürer|website=The Morgan Library &amp; Museum|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of [[Noam Chomsky]] in his pioneering of [[Computational Linguistics]] inspired the original formulation of Computational anatomy as a generative model of shape and form from exemplars acted upon via transformations.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computational Anatomy: An Emerging Discipline|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=309082.309089|journal = Q.

Due to the availability of dense 3D measurements via technologies such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), Computational anatomy has emerged as a subfield of [[medical imaging]] and [[bioengineering]] for extracting anatomical coordinate systems at the morphome scale in 3D. The spirit of this discipline shares strong overlap with areas such as [[computer vision]] and [[kinematics]] of [[rigid bodies]], where objects are studied by analysing the [[group (mathematics)|groups]] responsible for the movement in question. Computational anatomy departs from computer vision with its focus on rigid motions, as the infinite-dimensional diffeomorphism group is central to the analysis of Biological shapes. It is a branch of the image analysis and pattern theory school at Brown University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brown University -- Pattern Theory Group: Home|url = http://www.dam.brown.edu/ptg/participants.shtml|website = www.dam.brown.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered by [[Ulf Grenander]]. In Grenander's general Metric [[Pattern Theory]], making spaces of '''patterns''' into a [[Complete metric space|metric space]] is one of the fundamental operations since being able to cluster and recognize anatomical configurations often requires a metric of close and far between shapes. The [[Computational anatomy#The Right Invariant Metric on Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphometry metric]]&lt;ref name="Miller 36"/&gt; of Computational anatomy measures how far two diffeomorphic changes of coordinates are from each other, which in turn induces a [[Computational anatomy#The Metric on Shapes and Forms|metric on the shapes and images]] indexed to them. The models of metric pattern theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = General Pattern Theory : A Mathematical Study of Regular Structures |author=Grenander, Ulf |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198536710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pattern Theory: From Representation to Inference|author = U. Grenander and M. I. Miller  |publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 2007-02-08|location = Oxford|isbn = 9780199297061}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular group action on the orbit of shapes and forms is a central tool to the formal definitions in Computational anatomy.

==History==
Computational anatomy is the study of shape and form at the [[morphome]] or [[gross anatomy]] millimeter, or [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] scale, focusing on the study of sub-[[manifolds]] of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3,&lt;/math&gt; points, curves surfaces and subvolumes of human anatomy.
An early modern computational neuro-anatomist was David Van Essen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Two-dimensional maps of the cerebral cortex |journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology|date = 1980-05-15 |pmid = 7410593|pages = 255–281|volume = 191|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/cne.901910208|first = D. C.|last = Van Essen|first2 = J. H.|last2 = Maunsell}}&lt;/ref&gt; performing some of the early physical unfoldings of the human brain based on printing of a human cortex and cutting. [[Jean Talairach|Jean Talairach's]]  publication of [[Talairach coordinates|Tailarach coordinates]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; is an important milestone at the morphome scale demonstrating the fundamental basis of local coordinate systems in studying neuroanatomy and therefore the clear link to [[Differential geometry|charts of differential geometry]]. Concurrently, virtual mapping in Computational anatomy across high resolution dense image coordinates was already happening in [[Ruzena Bajcsy|Ruzena Bajcy's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Multiresolution Elastic Matching |journal = Comput. Vision Graph. Image Process.|date = 1989-04-01 |pages = 1–21|volume = 46|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/S0734-189X(89)80014-3|first = Ruzena|last = Bajcsy|first2 = Stane|last2 = Kovačič}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fred Bookstein's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Principal Warps: Thin-Plate Splines and the Decomposition of Deformations |journal = IEEE Trans.

L.|last = Bookstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;  earliest developments based on [[Computed Tomography|Computed axial tomography]] and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance imagery]].
The earliest introduction of the use of flows of diffeomorphisms for transformation of coordinate systems in image analysis and medical imaging was by Christensen, Joshi, Miller, and Rabbitt.&lt;ref name="Christensen"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVVGAQAAIAAJ|title=A deformable neuroanatomy textbook based on viscous fluid mechanics: Proceedings of the ...

The first formalization of Computational Anatomy as an orbit of exemplar templates under [[diffeomorphism]] [[group action]] was in the original lecture given by Grenander and Miller with that title in May 1997 at the 50th Anniversary of the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |editor=   Walter Freiberger |title = Current and Future Challenges in the Applications of Mathematics |journal=Quarterly of Applied Mathematics }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent publication.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; This was the basis for the strong departure from much of the previous work on advanced methods for [[spatial normalization]] and [[image registration]] which were historically built on notions of addition and basis expansion. The structure preserving transformations central to the modern field of Computational Anatomy, [[homeomorphism]]s and [[diffeomorphism]]s carry smooth submanifolds smoothly. They are generated via [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian flows]] which &lt;nowiki/&gt;satisfy a law of composition of functions forming the group property, but are not additive.

The original model of Computational anatomy was as the triple, &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{P}) \ ,
&lt;/math&gt; the group  &lt;math&gt; g \in \mathcal{G} &lt;/math&gt;, the orbit of shapes and forms &lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;, and the probability laws &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; which encode the variations of the objects in the orbit. The template or collection of templates are elements in the orbit &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{temp} \in \mathcal {M} &lt;/math&gt; of shapes.

The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of the equations of motion of Computational Anatomy took off post 1997 with several pivotal meetings including the 1997 Luminy meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Colloque Mathematiques et reconnaissance de formes|url = https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~cohen/MSPCV/luminy.html|website = www.ceremade.dauphine.fr|accessdate = 2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Azencott&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Robert Azencott, mathématicien polyglotte {{!}} La Recherche|url = http://www.larecherche.fr/actualite/aussi/robert-azencott-mathematicien-polyglotte-01-12-2000-70634|website = www.larecherche.fr|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; school at [[École Normale Supérieure|Ecole-Normale Cachan]] on the "Mathematics of Shape Recognition" and the 1998 Trimestre at [[Institut Henri Poincaré|Institute Henri Poincar]]é organized by [[David Mumford]] "Questions Mathématiques en Traitement du Signal et de l'Image"  which catalyzed the Hopkins-Brown-ENS Cachan groups and subsequent developments and connections of Computational anatomy to developments in global analysis.

The developments in Computational Anatomy included the establishment of the Sobelev smoothness conditions on the diffeomorphometry metric to insure existence of solutions of [[Calculus of variations|variational]] problems in the space of diffeomorphisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mariom/AM282-01/PAPERS/LANDMARK/an-approach-of-pattern.pdf|title = An Approach of Pattern Recognition through Infinite Dimensional Diffeomorphism|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Trouve|first = Alain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Variational Problems on Flows of Diffeomorphisms for Image Matching|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=298828.298844|journal = Q.

These contributions of Computational anatomy to the global analysis associated to the infinite dimensional manifolds of subgroups of the diffeomorphism group is far from trivial. The original idea of doing differential geometry, curvature and geodesics on infinite dimensional manifolds goes back to [[Bernhard Riemann]]'s [[Habilitation]] (Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/|title=Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen|website=www.maths.tcd.ie|access-date=2016-03-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318034045/http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/|archivedate=2016-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=9783642351204|author=Bernhard Riemann |title=Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie |publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;); the key modern book laying the foundations of such ideas in global analysis are from Michor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Peter W.

==The deformable template orbit model of computational anatomy==
The model of human anatomy is a deformable template, an orbit of exemplars under group action. Deformable template models have been central to Grenander's Metric Pattern theory, accounting for typicality via templates, and accounting for variability via transformation of the template. An orbit under group action as the representation of the deformable template is a classic formulation from differential geometry.  The space of shapes are denoted &lt;math&gt;m \in \mathcal {M}&lt;/math&gt;, with the [[group action|group]] &lt;nowiki/&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{ G}, \circ )&lt;/math&gt; with law of composition &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;; the action of the group on shapes is denoted &lt;math&gt;g \cdot m&lt;/math&gt;, where the action of the group &lt;math&gt;g \cdot m \in \mathcal{M}, m \in \mathcal {M}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt; (g \circ g^\prime) \cdot m = g \cdot (g^\prime \cdot m)\in \mathcal { M} .&lt;/math&gt;

The orbit &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; of the template becomes the space of all shapes, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \doteq \{ m  = g \cdot m_\mathrm{temp}, g \in \mathcal{G} \}&lt;/math&gt;, being homogenous under the action of the elements of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Medial-temporal-lobe-structures.png|alt=FIgure showing different examples of shapes and forms in Computational Anatomy from MR imager.|thumb|Figure depicting three medial temporal lobe structures amgydala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus with fiducial landmarks depicted as well embedded in the MRI background.]]
The orbit model of computational anatomy is an abstract algebra - to be compared to [[linear algebra]]- since the groups act nonlinearly on the shapes. This is a generalization of the classical models of linear algebra, in which the set of finite dimensional &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^n &lt;/math&gt; vectors are replaced by the finite-dimensional anatomical submanifolds (points, curves, surfaces and volumes) and images of them, and the &lt;math&gt; n \times n &lt;/math&gt; matrices of linear algebra are replaced by coordinate transformations based on linear and affine groups and the more general high-dimensional diffeomorphism groups.

==Shapes and forms==
The central objects are shapes or forms in Computational anatomy, one set of examples being the 0,1,2,3-dimensional submanifolds of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, a second set of examples being images generated via [[medical imaging]] such as via [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. [[File:Subcortical-MRI-caudate-putamen.png|alt=Figure showing triangualted meshes generated from populations of many segmented MRI brains. Each different surface represents a different shape in shape space.|thumb|Triangulated mesh surfaces depicting subcortical structures amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, putamen, ventricles.The shapes are denoted &lt;math&gt;m(u), u \in U\subset {\mathbb R}^1 \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^2&lt;/math&gt; represented as triangulated meshes.]] The 0-dimensional manifolds are landmarks or fiducial points; 1-dimensional manifolds are curves such as sulcul and gyral curves in the brain; 2-dimensional manifolds correspond to boundaries of substructures in anatomy such as the subcortical structures of the [[midbrain]] or the gyral surface of the [[neocortex]];  subvolumes correspond to subregions of the human body, the [[heart]], the [[thalamus]], the kidney.

The landmarks &lt;math&gt; X \doteq \{ x_1,\dots,x_n \} \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; are a collections of points with no other structure, delineating important fiducials within human shape and form (see associated landmarked image).
The sub-[[manifold]] shapes such as surfaces &lt;math&gt; X \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; are collections of points modeled as parametrized by a local chart or [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] &lt;math&gt; m:U \subset {\mathbb R}^{1,2} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m(u), u \in U&lt;/math&gt; (see Figure showing shapes as mesh surfaces).
The images such as MR images or DTI images &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, and are dense functions
&lt;math&gt; I(x), x \in X \subset {\mathbb R}^{1,2,3} &lt;/math&gt; are scalars, vectors, and matrices (see Figure showing scalar image).

==Groups and group actions==
{{Further|Group actions in computational anatomy}}[[File:T1-weighted-MRI.png|alt=Two-dimensional scalar image depicting a section through a 3D brain at the level of the subcortical structures showing white, gray and CSF matter.|thumb|Showing an MRI section through a 3D brain representing a scalar image &lt;math&gt;I(x), x \in {\mathbb R}^2&lt;/math&gt; based on T1-weighting.]][[Group (mathematics)|Group]]s and [[group actions]] are familiar to the Engineering community with the universal popularization and standardization of [[linear algebra]] as a basic model for analyzing [[signals and systems]] in [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]] and [[applied mathematics]]. In linear algebra the matrix groups (matrices with inverses) are the central structure, with group action defined by the usual definition of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as an &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix, acting on &lt;math&gt;x \in {\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \times 1&lt;/math&gt;  vectors; the orbit in linear-algebra is the set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-vectors given by &lt;math&gt;y = A \cdot x \in {\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, which is a group action of the matrices through the orbit of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The central group in Computational anatomy defined on volumes in  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; are the [[diffeomorphisms]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G} \doteq Diff&lt;/math&gt; which are mappings with 3-components &lt;math&gt;\phi(\cdot) = (\phi_1(\cdot),\phi_2 (\cdot),\phi_3 (\cdot))&lt;/math&gt;, law of composition of functions &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^\prime (\cdot)\doteq \phi (\phi^\prime(\cdot)) &lt;/math&gt;, with inverse &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^{-1}(\cdot) =\phi ( \phi^{-1}(\cdot))= id&lt;/math&gt;.

Most popular are scalar images, &lt;math&gt;I(x),x \in {\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, with action on the right via the inverse.

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot I(x) = I \circ \phi^{-1} (x), x \in {\mathbb R}^3
&lt;/math&gt;.

For sub-[[manifold]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s &lt;math&gt; X \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;, parametrized by a chart or [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] &lt;math&gt; m(u), u \in U &lt;/math&gt;, the diffeomorphic action the flow of the position

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot m(u) \doteq \phi\circ m(u), u \in U
&lt;/math&gt;.

Several [[group actions in computational anatomy]] have been defined.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms==
For the study of [[rigid body]] [[kinematics]], the low-dimensional matrix [[Lie groups]] have been the central focus. The matrix groups are low-dimensional mappings, which are diffeomorphisms that provide one-to-one correspondences between coordinate systems, with a smooth inverse. The [[matrix group]] of rotations and scales can be generated via a closed form finite-dimensional matrices which are solution of simple ordinary differential equations with solutions given by the matrix exponential.

For the study of deformable shape in Computational anatomy, a more general diffeomorphism group has been the group of choice, which is the infinite dimensional analogue. The high-dimensional differeomorphism groups used in Computational Anatomy are generated via smooth flows  &lt;math&gt; \phi_t,  t \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; which satisfy the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt; as first introduced in.,&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christensen 1435–14472"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=G.

==The diffeomorphism group of computational anatomy==
The group of diffeomorphisms is very big. To ensure smooth flows of diffeomorphisms avoiding [[Advection#Solving the equation|shock-like solutions]] for the inverse,  the vector fields must be at least 1-time continuously differentiable in space.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;P. Dupuis, U. Grenander, M.I. Miller, Existence of Solutions on Flows of Diffeomorphisms, Quarterly of Applied Math, 1997.

1034, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; For diffeomorphisms on &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt;, vector fields are modelled as elements of the Hilbert space  &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; using the [[Sobolev space|Sobolev]] embedding theorems so that each element  has strictly greater than 2 generalized square-integrable spatial derivatives (thus &lt;math&gt;v_i \in H_0^3, i=1,2,3,&lt;/math&gt; is sufficient), yielding 1-time continuously differentiable functions.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

The diffeomorphism group are flows with vector fields absolutely integrable in Sobolev norm:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;

{{Hide | Sobolev smoothness and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space with Green's kernel |

===The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space===

The modelling approach used in Computational anatomy enforces a continuous differentiability condition on the vector fields by modelling the space of vector fields &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; as a [[reproducing kernel Hilbert space]] (RKHS), with the norm defined by a 1-1, differential operator&lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt;, Green's inverse &lt;math&gt;K = A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The norm of the Hilbert space is induced by the differential operator.  For &lt;math&gt; \sigma(v) \doteq Av \in V^*
&lt;/math&gt; a generalized function or distribution, define the linear form as &lt;math&gt; (\sigma|w)\doteq \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  \sum_i w_i(x) \sigma_i(dx)
&lt;/math&gt;. This determines the norm on &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; according to
:&lt;math&gt; \langle v , w \rangle_V \doteq \int_X A v \cdot w dx, \ \| v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_X Av \cdot v dx, \ v,w \in V \ .
&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is a differential operator, finiteness of the norm-square &lt;math&gt;  (Av|v) &lt; \infty
&lt;/math&gt; includes derivatives from the differential operator implying smoothness of the vector fields.The [[Sobolev embedding]] theorem arguments were made in&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; demonstrating that 1-continuous derivative is required for smooth flows.
For proper choice of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; (V,\| \cdot \|_V) &lt;/math&gt; is an RKHS with the operator &lt;math&gt; K = A^{-1}: V^* \rightarrow V &lt;/math&gt;  termed the [[Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation|Green's]] operator generated from the [[Green's function]] (scalar case) for the vector field case. The Green's kernels associated to the differential operator smooths since the kernel  &lt;math&gt; k(\cdot,\cdot)
&lt;/math&gt; is continuously differentiable in both variables implying

:&lt;math&gt; K\sigma (x)_i \doteq \sum_j \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  k_{ij}(x,y) \sigma_j(dy)
&lt;/math&gt;

Oftentimes, the familiar Euclidean metric is not directly applicable because the patterns of shapes and images don't form a vector space. In the [[Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler Equation on Geodesics|Riemannian orbit model of Computational anatomy]], diffeomorphisms acting on the forms &lt;math&gt;\phi \cdot m \in \mathcal {M}, \phi \in Diff_V, m \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; don't act linearly. There are many ways to define metrics, and for the sets associated to shapes the [[Hausdorff metric]] is another. The method we use to induce the [[Riemannian metric]] is&lt;nowiki/&gt; used to induce the metric on the orbit of shapes by defining it in terms of the metric length between diffeomorphic coordinate system transformations of the flows. Measuring the lengths of the geodesic flow between coordinates systems in the orbit of shapes is called '''diffeomorphometry'''.

===The right-invariant metric on diffeomorphisms===
Define the distance on the group of diffeomorphisms   {{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;
d_{Diff_V}(\psi, \varphi) = \inf_{v_t} \left(\int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t dx \ dt: \phi_0 = \psi, \phi_1 = \varphi, \dot \phi_t = v_t \circ \phi_t \right)^{1/2} \ ;

==The action integral for Hamilton's principle on diffeomorphic flows==

In classical mechanics the evolution of physical systems is described by solutions to the Euler–Lagrange equations associated to the [[Least-action principle]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of [[Hamilton's principle|Hamilton]]. This is a standard way, for example of obtaining [[Newton's laws of motion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of free particles. More generally, the Euler-Lagrange equations can be derived for systems of [[generalized coordinates]]. The Euler-Lagrange equation in Computational anatomy describes the geodesic shortest path flows between coordinate systems of the diffeomorphism metric. In Computational anatomy the generalized coordinates are the flow of the diffeomorphism and its Lagrangian velocity &lt;math&gt;\phi, \dot{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;, the two related via the Eulerian velocity &lt;math&gt;v \doteq \dot{\phi} \circ \phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. 
[[Hamilton principle|Hamilton's principle]] for generating the Euler-Lagrange equation requires the action integral on the Lagrangian given by 
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;J(\phi) \doteq \int_0^1 L(\phi_t,\dot \phi_t) dt \ ;&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Hamiltonian-Integrated-Lagrangian}}}}
the Lagrangian is given by the kinetic energy:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; 
 L(\phi_t, \dot \phi_t ) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int_X A (\dot \phi_t \circ \phi_t^{-1}) \cdot (\dot \phi_t \circ \phi_t^{-1} ) dx
= \frac{1}{2} \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t \ dx \ .
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Lagrangian-Kinetic-Energy}}}}

==Diffeomorphic or Eulerian shape momentum==
In computational anatomy, &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; was first called the '''Eulerian or diffeomorphic shape momentum'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MILLER|first=MICHAEL I.|last2=TROUVÉ|first2=ALAIN|last3=YOUNES|first3=LAURENT|date=2006-01-31|title=Geodesic Shooting for Computational Anatomy |journal=Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision|volume=24|issue=2|pages=209–228|doi=10.1007/s10851-005-3624-0 |pmc=2897162|pmid=20613972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  since when integrated against Eulerian velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; gives energy density, and since there is a [[Computational anatomy#Conservation laws on diffeomorphic shape momentum for computational anatomy|conservation of diffeomorphic shape momentum]] which holds. The operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the generalized [[moment of inertia]] or inertial operator.

==The Euler–Lagrange equation on shape momentum for geodesics on the group of diffeomorphisms==
{{Further|Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy}}

Classical calculation of the Euler-Lagrange equation from [[Hamilton principle|Hamilton's principle]] requires the perturbation of the Lagrangian on the vector field in the kinetic energy with respect to first order perturbation of the flow. This requires adjustment by the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket of vector field]], given by operator &lt;math&gt; ad_v: w \in V \mapsto V &lt;/math&gt;  which involves the Jacobian given by 
:&lt;math&gt; ad_v[w]\doteq [v,w]\doteq (Dv)w-(Dw)v \in V &lt;/math&gt;.
:
Defining the adjoint &lt;math&gt; ad_v^*: V^* \rightarrow V^*,  &lt;/math&gt; then the first order variation gives the Eulerian shape momentum &lt;math&gt;Av \in V^*&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the generalized equation:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} Av_t + ad_{v_t}^* (Av_t)=0  \ , \ t \in [0,1] \  ;
&lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|EL-General}}}}

meaning for all smooth &lt;math&gt; w \in V ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \int_X \left( \frac{d}{dt} Av_t + ad_{v_t}^* (Av_t) \right) \cdot w dx =  \int_X \frac{d}{dt} Av_t \cdot  w dx + \int_X Av_t \cdot ((Dv_t)w-(Dw)v_t) dx =0 . &lt;/math&gt;

Computational anatomy is the study of the motions of submanifolds, points, curves, surfaces and volumes.
Momentum associated to points, curves and surfaces are all singular, implying the momentum is concentrated on subsets of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; which are dimension &lt;math&gt; \leq 2 &lt;/math&gt; in [[Lebesgue measure]]. In such cases, the energy is still well defined &lt;math&gt; (Av_t\mid v_t) &lt;/math&gt; since although &lt;math&gt; Av_t &lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function, the vector fields are smooth and the Eulerian momentum is understood via its action on smooth functions. The perfect illustration of this is even when it is a superposition of delta-diracs, the velocity of the coordinates in the entire volume move smoothly.The Euler-Lagrange equation ({{EquationNote|EL-General}}) on diffeomorphisms for generalized functions &lt;math&gt; Av \in V^* &lt;/math&gt; was derived in.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;M.I. Miller, A. Trouve, L. Younes, Geodesic Shooting in Computational Anatomy, IJCV, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler Equation on Geodesics|Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler-Lagrange Equation on Geodesics]] derivations are provided in terms of the adjoint operator and the Lie bracket for the group of diffeomorphisms. It has come to be called EPDiff equation for diffeomorphisms connecting to the Euler-Poincare method having been studied in the context of the inertial operator &lt;math&gt;A=identity&lt;/math&gt;  for incompressible, divergence free, fluids.&lt;ref name="Mumford" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holm | first1 = DD | last2 = Marsden | first2 = JE | last3 = Ratiu | first3 = TS | year = 1998 | title = The Euler-Poincaré equations and semidirect products with applications to continuum theories | url = | journal = Adv.

==Riemannian exponential (geodesic positioning) and Riemannian logarithm (geodesic coordinates)==
{{Further|Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy}}
In Medical imaging and Computational anatomy, positioning and coordinatizing shapes are fundamental operations; the system for positioning anatomical coordinates and shapes built on the metric and the Euler-Lagrange equation a geodesic positioning system as first explicated in Miller Trouve and Younes.&lt;ref name="Miller 36"/&gt;
Solving the geodesic from the initial condition &lt;math&gt; v_0 &lt;/math&gt; is termed the '''Riemannian-exponential,''' a mapping &lt;math&gt; Exp_{\rm id}(\cdot): V \to Diff_V

The Riemannian exponential satisfies &lt;math&gt;
Exp_{id} (v_0)= \phi_1 &lt;/math&gt; for initial condition &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_0 = v_0&lt;/math&gt;, vector field dynamics &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_t = v_t \circ \phi_t, t \in [0,1]

  Log_{ id}( \varphi) = v_0 \ \text{initial condition of EL geodesic } \dot \phi_0 = v_0, \phi_0=id,  \phi_1=\varphi \ .

Extended to the entire group they become

This function is the extended Hamiltonian. The [[Pontryagin maximum principle]]&lt;ref name="Miller null2"/&gt; gives the optimizing vector field which determines the geodesic flow satisfying &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_t = v_t \circ \phi_t , \phi_0=id,&lt;/math&gt; as well as the reduced Hamiltonian 
:&lt;math&gt; H(\phi_t,p_t) \doteq \max_v H( \phi_t, p_t,v) \ . &lt;/math&gt;
The Lagrange multiplier in its action as a linear form has its own inner product of the canonical momentum acting on the velocity of the flow which is dependent on the shape, e.g. for landmarks a sum, for surfaces a surface integral, and. for volumes it is a volume integral with respect to &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; on  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. In all cases the Greens kernels carry weights which are the canonical momentum evolving according to an ordinary differential equation which corresponds to EL but is the geodesic reparameterization in canonical momentum. The optimizing vector field is given by

&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Computational anatomy#Landmark or pointset geodesics|geodesics have Eulerian shape momentum which are a superposition of delta distributions]] travelling with the finite numbers of particles; the diffeomorphic flow of coordinates have velocities in the range of weighted Green's Kernels. For surfaces, the momentum is a [[Computational anatomy#Surface geodesics|surface integral of delta distributions]] travelling with the surface.&lt;ref name="Miller 36" /&gt;

The geodesics connecting coordinate systems satisfying {{EquationNote|EL-General}} have stationarity of the Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian is given by the extremum along the path &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H(\phi,p) = \max_v H(\phi,p,v)
&lt;/math&gt;, equalling the {{EquationNote|Lagrangian-Kinetic-Energy}}  and is stationary along {{EquationNote|EL-General}}. Defining the geodesic velocity at the identity &lt;math&gt;v_0 = \arg \max_v H(\phi_0,p_0,v)
&lt;/math&gt;, then along the geodesic
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;H(\phi_t,p_t) = H(\phi_0,p_0)=\frac{1}{2} \int_X p_0 \cdot v_0 dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_X Av_0 \cdot v_0 dx=\frac{1}{2} \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t dx
 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Hamiltonian-Geodesics}}}}The stationarity of the Hamiltonian demonstrates the interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier as momentum; integrated against velocity &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi&lt;/math&gt; gives energy density. The canonical momentum has many names.

==The metric on geodesic flows of landmarks, surfaces, and volumes within the orbit==
In Computational anatomy the submanifolds are pointsets, curves, surfaces and subvolumes which are the basic primitives. The geodesic flows between the submanifolds determine the distance, and form the basic measuring and transporting tools of [[diffeomorphometry]]. At  &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; the geodesic has vector field &lt;math&gt;v_0 = K p_0&lt;/math&gt; determined by the conjugate momentum and the Green's kernel of the inertial operator defining the Eulerian momentum &lt;math&gt;K=A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The metric distance between coordinate systems connected via the geodesic determined by the induced distance between identity and group element:
:&lt;math&gt;d_{Diff_V}(id,\varphi) = \|Log_{id}(\varphi)\|_V=\| v_0 \|_V = \sqrt{2H(id,p_0)}&lt;/math&gt;

==[[Conservation law (physics)|Conservation law]]s on diffeomorphic shape momentum for computational anatomy==
Given the least-action there is a natural definition of momentum associated to generalized coordinates; the quantity acting against velocity gives energy. The field has studied two forms, the momentum associated to the Eulerian vector field termed '''Eulerian diffeomorphic shape momentum''', and the momentum associated to the initial coordinates or canonical coordinates termed '''canonical diffeomorphic shape momentum'''. Each has a conservation law.The conservation of momentum goes hand in hand with the {{EquationNote|EL-General}}. In Computational anatomy, &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; is the Eulerian [[Momentum]] since when integrated against Eulerian velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; gives energy density; operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the generalized [[moment of inertia]] or inertial operator which acting on the Eulerian velocity gives momentum which is conserved along the geodesic: {{NumBlk|:|

The running cost is reduced to the initial cost determined by &lt;math&gt;v_0=Kp_0&lt;/math&gt; of  {{EquationNote|Kernel-Surf.-Land.-Geodesics}}.

===High Angular Resolution Diffusion Image (HARDI) matching in computational anatomy===
{{Further| Group actions in computational anatomy | LDDMM#LDDMM ODF}}

High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) addresses the well-known limitation of DTI, that is, DTI can only reveal one dominant fiber orientation at each location. HARDI measures diffusion along &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; uniformly distributed directions on the sphere and can characterize more complex fiber geometries. HARDI can be used to reconstruct an [[orientation distribution function]] (ODF) that characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules. The ODF is a function defined on a unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb{S}}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Dense LDDMM ODF matching &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Du|first1=J|last2=Goh|first2=A|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Diffeomorphic metric mapping of high angular resolution diffusion imaging based on Riemannian structure of orientation distribution functions|journal=IEEE Trans Med Imaging|date=2012|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1033|doi=10.1109/TMI.2011.2178253|pmid=22156979}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes the HARDI data as ODF at each voxel and solves the LDDMM variational problem in the space of ODF. In the field of [[information geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amari|first1=S|title=Differential-Geometrical Methods in Statistics|date=1985|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; the space of ODF forms a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher-Rao metric. For the purpose of LDDMM ODF mapping, the square-root representation is chosen because it is one of the most efficient representations found to date as the various Riemannian operations, such as geodesics, exponential maps, and logarithm maps, are available in closed form. In the following, denote square-root ODF (&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative to ensure uniqueness and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The variational problem for matching assumes that two ODF volumes can be generated from one to another via flows of diffeomorphisms &lt;math&gt; \phi_t &lt;/math&gt;, which are solutions of ordinary differential equations 
&lt;math&gt; \dot \phi_t = v_t (\phi_t), t \in [0,1], &lt;/math&gt; starting from
the identity map &lt;math&gt;\phi_0={id} &lt;/math&gt;. Denote the action of the diffeomorphism on template  as &lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}({\bf s},x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; are respectively the coordinates of the unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt; and the image domain, with the target indexed similarly, &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}({\bf s}, x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt;.

The group action of the diffeomorphism on the template is given according to
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi (x)\doteq  (D\phi_1) \psi \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x), x \in X &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; (D\phi_1) &lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of the affined transformed ODF and is defined as
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(D \phi_1) \psi\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x) =   \sqrt{\frac{\det{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1}} }{\left\|{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} } {\bf s} \right\|^3} } \quad
\psi \left( \frac{(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}}{\|(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}\|}, \phi_1^{-1}(x) \right) .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
:
This group action of diffeomorphisms on ODF reorients the ODF and reflects changes in both the magnitude of &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; and the sampling directions of &lt;math&gt; \bf s &lt;/math&gt; due to affine transformation. It guarantees that the volume fraction of fibers oriented toward a small patch must remain the same after the patch is transformed. 
:
The LDDMM variational problem is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
C(v) = \inf_{v: \dot \phi_t =
v_t \circ \phi_t,\phi_0={
id}}\int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t dx \ dt 
 +\lambda \int_{x\in\Omega}\|\log_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}} \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}(\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}(x))\|^2_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}dx 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

where the logarithm of &lt;math&gt; \psi_1, \psi_2 \in \Psi &lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\|\log_{\psi_1}(\psi_2)\|_{\psi_1} 
=\cos^{-1} \langle \psi_1, \psi_2 \rangle = 
\cos^{-1}\left(\int_{{\bf s}\in {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi_1({\bf s}) \psi_2({\bf s})d{\bf s}\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the normal dot product between points in the sphere under the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}^2 &lt;/math&gt; metric.

The principle mode of variation represented by the orbit model is change of coordinates. For setting in which pairs of images are not related by diffeomorphisms but have photometric variation or image variation not represented by the template, [[active appearance model]]ling has been introduced, originally by Edwards-Cootes-Taylor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Active appearance models |publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 1998-06-02|isbn = 9783540646136|pages = 484–498|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science |first = T.

In the context of Computational Anatomy in which metrics on the anatomical orbit has been studied, '''metamorphosis''' for modelling structures such as tumors and photometric changes which are not resident in the template was introduced in&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; for Magnetic Resonance image models, with many subsequent developments extending the metamorphosis framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Metamorphoses Through Lie Group Action|date = 2005-01-01|first = Alain|last = Trouvé|first2 = Laurent|last2 = Younes|citeseerx = 10.1.1.157.8752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|title = The Euler-Poincare theory of Metamorphosis |eprint=0806.0870 |date = 2008-06-04|first = Darryl D.|last = Holm|first2 = Alain|last2 = Trouve|first3 = Laurent|last3 = Younes|class=cs.CV }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|title = Metamorphosis of Images in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces|eprint=1409.6573|date = 2014-09-23|first = Casey L.|last = Richardson|first2 = Laurent|last2 = Younes|class=math.OC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For image matching the image metamorphosis framework enlarges the action so that &lt;math&gt; t \mapsto (\phi_t,I_t) &lt;/math&gt; with action &lt;math&gt; \phi_t \cdot I_t \doteq I_t \circ \phi_t^{-1}  &lt;/math&gt;. In this setting metamorphosis combines both the diffeomorphic coordinate system transformation of Computational Anatomy as well as the early [[morphing]] technologies which only faded or modified the photometric or image intensity alone.

Then the matching problem takes a form with equality boundary conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;
\min_{(v,I)}
\frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \left( \int_X A v_t \cdot v_t dx +
\| \dot I_t \circ \phi_t^{-1} \|^2 / \sigma^2 \right) \, dt  \text{ subject to} \ \phi_0=id, I_0=\text{fixed}, I_1=\text{fixed}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Matching landmarks, curves, surfaces==
Transforming coordinate systems based on [[Landmark point]] or [[fiducial marker]] features dates back to Bookstein's early work on small deformation spline methods&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Principal Warps: Thin-Plate Splines and the Decomposition of Deformations|url = http://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tp/1989/06/i0567.pdf|journal = IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|date = 1989-01-01 |pages = 567–585|volume = 11|issue = 6|doi = 10.1109/34.24792|first = F. L.|last = Bookstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; for interpolating correspondences defined by fiducial points to the two-dimensional or three-dimensional background space in which the fiducials are defined. Large deformation landmark methods came on in the late 90's.&lt;ref name="Miller 209–228"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Joshi 1357–1370"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geodesic Interpolating Splines|url = |doi=10.1007/3-540-44745-8_34|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2001-09-03|isbn = 9783540425236|pages = 513–527|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|first = Vincent|last = Camion|first2 = Laurent|last2 = Younes|editor-first = Mário|editor-last = Figueiredo|editor-first2 = Josiane|editor-last2 = Zerubia|editor-first3 = Anil K.|editor-last3 = Jain|citeseerx = 10.1.1.57.7394}}&lt;/ref&gt; The above Figure depicts a series of landmarks associated three brain structures, the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus.

Matching geometrical objects like unlabelled point distributions, curves or surfaces is another common problem in Computational Anatomy. Even in the discrete setting where these are commonly given as vertices with meshes, there are no predetermined correspondences between points as opposed to the situation of landmarks described above. From the theoretical point of view, while any submanifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; d=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt; can be parameterized in local charts &lt;math&gt; m: u \in U \subset {\mathbb R}^{0,1,2,3} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, all reparametrizations of these charts give geometrically the same manifold. Therefore, early on in Computational anatomy, investigators have identified the necessity of parametrization invariant representations. One indispensable requirement is that the end-point matching term between two submanifolds is itself independent of their parametrizations. This can be achieved via concepts and methods borrowed from [[Geometric measure theory]], in particular [[Current (mathematics)|currents]]&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Surface matching via currents |journal = Information Processing in Medical Imaging: Proceedings of the ...

[[LDDMM#Joshi's original LDDMM landmark matching|for large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping for landmarks]] is given.

===Measure matching: unregistered landmarks===
Glaunes and co-workers first introduced diffeomorphic matching of pointsets in the general setting of matching distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Glaunes|first=J.|last2=Trouve|first2=A.|last3=Younes|first3=L.|date=2004-06-01|title=Diffeomorphic matching of distributions: a new approach for unlabelled point-sets and sub-manifolds matching|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1315234&amp;url=http%253A%252F%252Fieeexplore.ieee.org%252Fxpls%252Fabs_all.jsp%253Farnumber%253D1315234|journal=Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2004.

The template and target discrete point clouds are represented as two weighted sums of Diracs &lt;math&gt; \mu_{m} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_i \delta_{x_i} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu_{m^\prime} = \sum_{i=1}^{n^\prime} \rho^{\prime}_{i} \delta_{x^{\prime}_{i}} &lt;/math&gt; living in the space of [[signed measure]]s of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. The space is equipped with a Hilbert metric obtained from a real positive kernel &lt;math&gt; k(x,y) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, giving the following norm:

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mu_{m} \|_\mathrm{mea}^2 = \sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \rho_i \rho_j k(x_i,x_j)
&lt;/math&gt;

The matching problem between a template and target point cloud may be then formulated using this kernel metric for the endpoint matching term:

: &lt;math&gt;
\min_{\phi: v=\dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int
     (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt  +\frac{1}{2} \| \mu_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mu_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{mea}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mu_{\phi_1 \cdot m} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_i \delta_{\phi_1(x_i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the distribution transported by the deformation.

===Curve matching===
In the one dimensional case, a curve in 3D can be represented by an embedding &lt;math&gt; m: u \in [0,1] \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, and the group action of ''Diff'' becomes &lt;math&gt; \phi \cdot m = \phi \circ m&lt;/math&gt;. However, the correspondence between curves and embeddings is not one to one as the any reparametrization &lt;math&gt;m \circ \gamma&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; a diffeomorphism of the interval [0,1], represents geometrically the same curve. In order to preserve this invariance in the end-point matching term, several extensions of the previous 0-dimensional measure matching approach can be considered.

* '''Curve matching with currents'''
In the situation of oriented curves, currents give an efficient setting to construct invariant matching terms. In such representation, curves are interpreted as elements of a functional space dual to the space vector fields, and compared through kernel norms on these spaces. Matching of two curves &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m^\prime&lt;/math&gt; writes eventually as the variational problem

: &lt;math&gt;
\min_{\phi: v=\dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int
     (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt  +\frac{1}{2} \| \mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

with the endpoint term &lt;math&gt; E(\phi_1) = \| \mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2/2 &lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the norm

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mathcal{C}_{m} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2 = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 K_C(m(u),m(v)) \partial m(u) \cdot \partial m(v) \, du \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

the derivative &lt;math&gt; \partial m(u)&lt;/math&gt; being the tangent vector to the curve and &lt;math&gt; K_{\mathcal{C}} &lt;/math&gt; a given matrix kernel of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. Such expressions are invariant to any positive reparametrizations of &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m'&lt;/math&gt;, and thus still depend on the orientation of the two curves.

* '''Curve matching with varifolds'''
Varifold is an alternative to currents when orientation becomes an issue as for instance in situations involving multiple bundles of curves for which no "consistent" orientation may be defined. Varifolds directly extend 0-dimensional measures by adding an extra tangent space direction to the position of points, leading to represent curves as measures on the product of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; and the [[Grassmannian]] of all straight lines in &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. The matching problem between two curves then consists in replacing the endpoint matching term by &lt;math&gt; E(\phi_1) = \| \mathcal{V}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{V}_{m^\prime} \|_{cur}^2/2 &lt;/math&gt; with varifold norms of the form:

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mathcal{V}_m \|_{var}^2 = \int_{0}^1 \int_{0}^1 k_{\mathbb{R}^3}(m(u),m(v)) k_{\mathbf{Gr}}\left([\partial m(u)],[\partial m(v)] \right) {{|}}\partial m(u){{|}} {{|}}\partial m(v) {{|}} \, du \, dv 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; [\partial m(u)]&lt;/math&gt; is the non-oriented line directed by tangent vector &lt;math&gt; \partial m(u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_{\mathbb{R}^3}, k_{\mathbf{Gr}}&lt;/math&gt; two scalar kernels respectively on  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; and the Grassmannian. Due to the inherent non-oriented nature of the Grassmannian representation, such expressions are invariant to positive and negative reparametrizations.

===Surface matching===
Surface matching share many similarities with the case of curves. Surfaces in &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; are parametrized in local charts by embeddings &lt;math&gt; m: u \in U \subset {\mathbb R}^{2} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, with all reparametrizations &lt;math&gt; m\circ \gamma &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; a diffeomorphism of U being equivalent geometrically. Currents and varifolds can be also used to formalize surface matching.

* '''Surface matching with currents'''
Oriented surfaces can be represented as 2-currents which are dual to differential 2-forms. In &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, one can further identify 2-forms with vector fields through the standard wedge product of 3D vectors. In that setting, surface matching writes again:

: &lt;math&gt;
\min_{\phi: v=\dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int
     (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt  +\frac{1}{2} \| \mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

with the endpoint term &lt;math&gt; E(\phi_1) = \| \mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2/2 &lt;/math&gt; given through the norm

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mathcal{C}_{m} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2 = \iint_{U\times U} K_C(m(u),m(v)) \vec{n}(u) \cdot \vec{n}(v) \, du \, dv

* '''Surface matching with varifolds'''
For non-orientable or non-oriented surfaces, the varifold framework is often more adequate. Identifying the parametric surface &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; with a varifold &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{V}_m &lt;/math&gt; in the space of measures on the product of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; and the Grassmannian, one simply replaces the previous current metric &lt;math&gt; \| \mathcal{C}_{m} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2 &lt;/math&gt; by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mathcal{V}_{m} \|_\mathrm{var}^2 = \iint_{U\times U} k_{\mathbb{R}^3}(m(u),m(v)) k_{\mathbf{Gr}}\left([\vec{n}(u)],[\vec{n}(v)] \right) {{|}}\vec{n}(u){{|}} {{|}}\vec{n}(v) {{|}} \, du \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; [\vec{n}(u)] &lt;/math&gt; is the (non-oriented) line directed by the normal vector to the surface.

==Growth and atrophy from longitudinal time-series==

There are many settings in which there are a series of measurements, a time-series to which the underlying
coordinate systems will be matched and flowed onto. This occurs for example

An observed time sequence is given and the goal is to infer the time flow of geometric change of coordinates carrying the exemplars or templars through the period of observations.

The generic time-series matching problem considers the series of times is &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; t_1 &lt; \dots t_K = 1&lt;/math&gt;. The flow optimizes at the series of costs &lt;math&gt;E(t_k), k=1, \dots, K&lt;/math&gt; giving optimization problems of the form

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{\phi:v= \dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}, \phi_0=id} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt +\sum_{k=1}^K E( \phi_{t_k})

==Statistical shape theory in computational anatomy==
{{Further|Statistical shape analysis|Shape theory (mathematics)}}

[[Shape]] in computational anatomy is a local theory, indexing shapes and structures to templates to which they are [[bijectively]] mapped. [[Statistical shape analysis|Statistical shape]] in Computational Anatomy is the empirical study of diffeomorphic correspondences between populations and common template coordinate systems.  This is a strong departure from [[Procrustes|Procrustes Analyses]] and shape theories pioneered by [[David George Kendall|David G. Kendall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Survey of the Statistical Theory of Shape|jstor=2245331|journal = Statistical Science|date = 1989-01-01|pages = 87–99|volume = 4|issue = 2|first = David G.|last = Kendall|doi=10.1214/ss/1177012582}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that the central group of Kendall's theories are the finite-dimensional Lie groups, whereas the theories of shape in Computational Anatomy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1007/978-88-7642-387-1_4|publisher = Scuola Normale Superiore|date = 2012-01-01|isbn = 9788876423888|pages = 43–53|series = Colloquia |first = David|last = Mumford|editor-first = Umberto|editor-last = Zannier|title = Colloquium de Giorgi 2009|chapter = The geometry and curvature of shape spaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 1st|title = Shapes and Diffeomorphisms |author=Laurent Younes |publisher = Springer|date = 2010-05-25|isbn = 9783642120541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Spaces and Manifolds of Shapes in Computer Vision: An Overview |journal = Image Vision Comput.|date = 2012-06-01 |pages = 389–397|volume = 30|issue = 6–7|doi = 10.1016/j.imavis.2011.09.009|first = Laurent|last = Younes}}&lt;/ref&gt; have focused on the diffeomorphism group, which to first order via the Jacobian can be thought of as a field–thus infinite dimensional–of low-dimensional Lie groups of scale and rotations. 
[[File:Subcortical structures embedded in two-dimensional momentum space.png|alt=showing man sub-cortical structures|thumb|Figure showing hundreds of sub-cortical structures embedded in two-dimensional momentum space generated from the first two eigenvectors of the empirical co-variance estimated from the population of shapes.]]
The random orbit model provides the natural setting to understand empirical shape and shape statistics within Computational anatomy since the non-linearity of the induced probability law on anatomical shapes and forms 
&lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; is induced via the reduction to the vector fields &lt;math&gt; v_0 \in V &lt;/math&gt; at the tangent space at the identity of the diffeomorphism group. The successive flow of the Euler equation induces the random space of shapes and forms &lt;math&gt;Exp_{id}(v_0) \cdot m \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

Performing empirical statistics on this tangent space at the identity is the natural way for inducing probability laws on the statistics of shape. Since both the vector fields and the Eulerian momentum &lt;math&gt;Av_0&lt;/math&gt; are in a Hilbert space the natural model is one of a Gaussian random field, so that given test function &lt;math&gt;w \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then the inner-products with the test functions are Gaussian distributed with mean and covariance.

This is depicted in the accompanying figure where sub-cortical brain structures are depicted in a two-dimensional coordinate system based on inner products of their initial vector fields that generate them from the template is shown in a 2-dimensional span of the Hilbert space.

The study of shape and statistics in populations are local theories, indexing shapes and structures to templates to which they are bijectively mapped. Statistical shape is then the study of diffeomorphic correspondences relative to the template. A core operation is the generation of templates from populations, estimating a shape that is matched to the population. There are several important methods for generating templates including methods based on [[Frechet]] averaging,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unbiased diffeomorphic atlas construction for computational anatomy|journal = NeuroImage|date = 2004-01-01|pages = 151–160|volume = 23|first = S.|last = Joshi|first2 = Brad|last2 = Davis|first3 = B.

'''Diamond''' is a [[Allotropes of carbon|solid form of the element carbon]] with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called [[diamond cubic]]. At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|room temperature and pressure]], another solid form of carbon known as [[graphite]] is the [[Chemical stability|chemically stable]] form, but diamond almost never converts to it. Diamond has the highest [[Scratch hardness|hardness]] and [[thermal conductivity]] of any natural material,  properties that are utilized in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools. They are also the reason that [[diamond anvil cell]]s can subject materials to pressures found deep in the Earth.

Because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid, few types of impurity can contaminate it (two exceptions being [[boron]] and [[nitrogen]]). Small numbers of [[lattice defect|defects]] or impurities (about one per million of lattice atoms) color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), brown (defects), green (radiation exposure), purple, pink, orange or red. Diamond also has relatively high [[optical dispersion]] (ability to disperse light of different colors).

Most natural diamonds have ages between 1&amp;nbsp;billion and 3.5&amp;nbsp;billion years. Most were formed at depths between {{convert|150|and|250|sp=us|km}} in the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], although a few have come from as deep as {{convert|800|sp=us|km}}. Under high pressure and temperature, carbon-containing fluids dissolved minerals and replaced them with diamonds. Much more recently (tens to hundreds of million years ago), they were carried to the surface in [[volcanic eruptions]] and deposited in [[igneous rock]]s known as [[kimberlite]]s and [[lamproite]]s.

[[Synthetic diamond]]s can be grown from high-purity carbon under high pressures and temperatures or from [[hydrocarbon]] gas by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). [[Diamond simulant|Imitation diamonds]] can also be made out of materials such as [[cubic zirconia]] and [[silicon carbide]]. Natural, synthetic and imitation diamonds are most commonly distinguished using optical techniques or thermal conductivity measurements.

==Material properties==
{{Main|Material properties of diamond}}
Diamond is a solid form of pure carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal. Solid carbon comes in different forms known as [[allotrope]]s depending on the type of chemical bond. The two most common [[allotropes of carbon|allotropes of pure carbon]] are diamond and [[graphite]].

Diamonds have been adapted for many uses because of the material's exceptional physical characteristics. Most notable are its extreme hardness and thermal conductivity (900–{{val|2320|u=W·m{{Sup|−1}}·K{{Sup|−1}}}}),&lt;ref name=PNU&gt;

===Thermodynamics===
[[File:Carbon basic phase diagram.png|thumb|Theoretically predicted [[phase diagram]] of carbon]]
The equilibrium pressure and temperature conditions for a transition between graphite and diamond is well established theoretically and experimentally. The pressure changes linearly between {{val|1.7|ul=GPa}} at {{val|0|u=K}} and {{val|12|u=GPa}} at {{val|5000|u=K}} (the diamond/graphite/liquid [[triple point]]).&lt;ref name=Bundy&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bundy |first1=P. |last2=Bassett |first2=W.

However, the phases have a wide region about this line where they can coexist. At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|normal temperature and pressure]], {{convert|20|C|K}} and {{convert|1|atm|MPa}}, the stable phase of carbon is graphite, but diamond is [[metastable]] and its rate of conversion to graphite is negligible.&lt;ref name=ChemThermo/&gt; However, at temperatures above about {{val|4500|u=K}}, diamond rapidly converts to graphite. Rapid conversion of graphite to diamond requires pressures well above the equilibrium line: at {{val|2000|u=K}}, a pressure of {{val|35|u=GPa}} is needed.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt;

Above the triple point, the melting point of diamond increases slowly with increasing pressure; but at pressures of hundreds of GPa, it decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Xiaofei |last2=Scandolo |first2=Sandro |last3=Car |first3=Roberto |title=Carbon Phase Diagram from ''Ab Initio'' Molecular Dynamics |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=25 October 2005 |volume=95 |issue=18 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.185701}}&lt;/ref&gt; At high pressures, [[silicon]] and [[germanium]] have a BC8 [[Cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and a similar structure is predicted for carbon at high pressures.

===Crystal structure===
{{See also|Crystallographic defects in diamond}}
[[File:Diamond structure.gif|thumb|Diamond unit cell, showing the tetrahedral structure.]]
The most common crystal structure of diamond is called [[diamond cubic]]. It is formed of [[unit cell]]s (see the figure) stacked together. Although there are 18 atoms in the figure, each corner atom is shared by eight unit cells and each atom in the center of a face is shared by two, so there are a total of eight atoms per unit cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rajendran |first1=V. |title=Materials science |date=2004 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Pub |isbn=9780070583696 |pages=2.16–2.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each side of the unit cell is 3.57 [[angstrom]]s in length.&lt;ref name=Ashcroft&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ashcroft |first1=Neil W. |last2=Mermin |first2=N. David |title=Solid state physics |date=1976 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |isbn=0030839939 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A diamond cubic lattice can be thought of as two interpenetrating [[face-centered cubic]] lattices with one displaced by 1/4 of the diagonal along a cubic cell, or as one lattice with two atoms associated with each lattice point.&lt;ref name=Ashcroft/&gt; Looked at from a {{math|&amp;lt;1 1 1&amp;gt;}} [[Miller index|crystallographic direction]], it is formed of layers stacked in a repeating ABCABC ... pattern. Diamonds can also form an ABAB ... structure, which is known as hexagonal diamond or [[lonsdaleite]], but this is far less common and is formed under different conditions from cubic carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Molecular models of porous carbons|last1=Bandosz |first1=Teresa J. |last2=Biggs |first2=Mark J. |last3=Gubbins |first3=Keith E. |last4=Hattori |first4=Y. |last5=Iiyama |first5=T. |last6=Kaneko |first6=Tatsumi |last7=Pikunic |first7=Jorge |last8=Thomson |first8=Kendall|editor-last1=Radovic |editor-first1=Ljubisa R. |title=Chemistry and physics of carbon |volume=28 |date=2003 |publisher=Marcel Dekker |isbn=9780824709877 |pages=46-47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal habit===

Diamonds occur most often as [[euhedral]] or rounded [[octahedron|octahedra]] and [[Crystal twinning|twinned]] octahedra known as ''[[macle]]s''. As diamond's crystal structure has a cubic arrangement of the atoms, they have many [[facet]]s that belong to a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], octahedron, [[rhombicosidodecahedron]], [[tetrakis hexahedron]] or [[disdyakis dodecahedron]]. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can be elongated. Diamonds (especially those with rounded crystal faces) are commonly found coated in ''nyf'', an opaque gum-like skin.&lt;ref&gt;

Some diamonds have opaque fibers. They are referred to as ''opaque'' if the fibers grow from a clear substrate or ''fibrous'' if they occupy the entire crystal. Their colors range from yellow to green or gray, sometimes with cloud-like white to gray impurities. Their most common shape is cuboidal, but they can also form octahedra, dodecahedra, macles or combined shapes. The structure is the result of numerous impurities with sizes between 1 and 5 microns. These diamonds probably formed in kimberlite magma and sampled the volatiles.&lt;ref name=Cartigny&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cartigny|first1=Pierre|last2=Palot|first2=Médéric|last3=Thomassot|first3=Emilie|last4=Harris|first4=Jeff W.|title=Diamond Formation: A Stable Isotope Perspective|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|date=30 May 2014|volume=42|issue=1|pages=699–732|doi=10.1146/annurev-earth-042711-105259|bibcode=2014AREPS..42..699C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamonds can also form polycrystalline aggregates.

===Mechanical properties===
====Hardness====
[[File:Vickers anvil diamons.jpg|thumb|The extreme hardness of diamond in certain orientations makes it useful in materials science, as in this pyramidal diamond embedded in the working surface of a [[Vickers hardness test]]er.]]
Diamond is the hardest known natural material on both the [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers scale]] and the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Diamond's great hardness relative to other materials has been known since antiquity, and is the source of its name.

Diamond hardness depends on its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the [[Miller index#Case of cubic structures|&lt;111&gt;]] direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=142–147|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jtC1mUFZfQcC&amp;pg=PA143|title=Properties, Growth and Applications of Diamond|last1=Neves | first1= A. J. |last2= Nazaré | first2= M. H.|publisher=[[Institution of Engineering and Technology]]|year= 2001|isbn=0-85296-785-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, whereas it might be possible to scratch some diamonds with other materials, such as [[boron nitride]], the hardest diamonds can only be scratched by other diamonds and [[Aggregated diamond nanorod|nanocrystalline diamond aggregates]].

The hardness of diamond contributes to its suitability as a gemstone. Because it can only be scratched by other diamonds, it maintains its polish extremely well. Unlike many other gems, it is well-suited to daily wear because of its resistance to scratching—perhaps contributing to its popularity as the preferred gem in [[engagement ring|engagement]] or [[wedding ring]]s, which are often worn every day.

The hardest natural diamonds mostly originate from the [[Copeton Dam|Copeton]] and [[Bingara]] fields located in the [[New England (Australia)|New England]] area in [[New South Wales]], Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness is associated with the [[crystal growth]] form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness. It is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are harder than the diamonds used in hardness gauges.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Toughness====
Somewhat related to hardness is another mechanical property ''toughness'', which is a material's ability to resist breakage from forceful impact. The [[toughness]] of natural diamond has been measured as 7.5–10 [[Megapascal|MPa]]·m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its resistance to breakage. Diamond has a [[cleavage plane]] and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. [[Diamond cutting|Diamond cutters]] use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting.&lt;ref name=harlow/&gt; "Impact toughness" is one of the main indexes to measure the quality of synthetic industrial diamonds.

====Yield strength====
Diamond has compressive yield strength of 130–140{{nbsp}}GPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eremets |first1=Mikhail I. |last2=Trojan |first2=Ivan A. |last3=Gwaze |first3=Patience |last4=Huth |first4=Joachim |last5=Boehler |first5=Reinhard |last6=Blank |first6=Vladimir D. |title=The strength of diamond |journal=Applied Physics Letters |date=3 October 2005 |volume=87 |issue=14 |pages=141902 |doi=10.1063/1.2061853}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exceptionally high value, along with the hardness and transparency of diamond, are the reasons that [[diamond anvil]] cells are the main tool for high pressure experiments.&lt;ref name=Dubrovinsky&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dubrovinsky |first1=Leonid |last2=Dubrovinskaia |first2=Natalia |last3=Prakapenka |first3=Vitali B |last4=Abakumov |first4=Artem M |title=Implementation of micro-ball nanodiamond anvils for high-pressure studies above 6 Mbar |journal=Nature Communications |date=23 October 2012 |volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1038/ncomms2160}}&lt;/ref&gt; These anvils have reached pressures of {{val|600|u=GPa}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/nov/02/improved-diamond-anvil-cell-allows-higher-pressures-than-ever-before Improved diamond anvil cell allows higher pressures ''Physics World'' November 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; Much higher pressures may be possible with nanocrystalline diamonds.&lt;ref name=Dubrovinsky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Improved diamond-anvil cell allows higher pressures than ever before – Physics World |url=https://physicsworld.com/a/improved-diamond-anvil-cell-allows-higher-pressures-than-ever-before/ |accessdate=1 November 2018 |work=Physics World |date=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical conductivity===
Other specialized applications also exist or are being developed, including use as [[semiconductor]]s: some [[blue diamonds]] are natural semiconductors, in contrast to most diamonds, which are excellent [[Insulator (electricity)|electrical insulators]].&lt;ref name="boron"/&gt; The conductivity and blue color originate from boron impurity. Boron substitutes for carbon atoms in the diamond lattice, donating a hole into the [[valence band]].&lt;ref name="boron"&gt;

Substantial conductivity is commonly observed in nominally [[Doping (semiconductor)|undoped]] diamond grown by [[Chemical vapor deposition of diamond|chemical vapor deposition]]. This conductivity is associated with hydrogen-related species adsorbed at the surface, and it can be removed by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] or other surface treatments.&lt;ref name="Landstrass"&gt;

===Surface property===
Diamonds are naturally [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] and [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], which means the diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water, but can be easily wet and stuck by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds. However, when diamond surfaces are chemically modified with certain ions, they are expected to become so [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] that they can stabilize multiple layers of [[ice|water ice]] at [[human body temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink1 = Alex Wissner-Gross | first1 = A.

The surface of diamonds is partially oxidized. The oxidized surface can be reduced by heat treatment under hydrogen flow. That is to say, this heat treatment partially removes oxygen-containing functional groups. But diamonds (sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;C) are unstable against high temperature (above about {{convert|400|C}}) under atmospheric pressure. The structure gradually changes into sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C above this temperature. Thus, diamonds should be reduced under this temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Ayaka Fujimoto |first1=A. |last1=Fujimoto |first2=Y. |last2=Yamada |first3=M. |last3=Koinuma |first4=S. |last4=Sato |doi=10.1021/acs.analchem.6b01327 |title=Origins of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;C peaks in C&lt;sub&gt;1s&lt;/sub&gt; X-ray Photoelectron Spectra of Carbon Materials |journal=[[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Analytical Chemistry]] |volume=88 |page=6110 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical stability===
Diamonds are not very reactive. Under room temperature diamonds do not react with any chemical reagents including strong acids and bases. A diamond's surface can only be oxidized at temperatures above about {{convert|850|C}} in air. Diamond also reacts with fluorine gas above about {{convert|700|C}}.

Diamond has a wide [[bandgap]] of {{val|5.5|ul=eV}} corresponding to the deep [[ultraviolet]] wavelength of 225 nanometers. This means that pure diamond should transmit visible light and appear as a clear colorless crystal. Colors in diamond originate from lattice defects and impurities. The diamond crystal lattice is exceptionally strong, and only atoms of [[nitrogen]], [[boron]] and [[hydrogen]] can be introduced into diamond during the growth at significant concentrations (up to atomic percents). Transition metals [[nickel]] and [[cobalt]], which are commonly used for growth of synthetic diamond by high-pressure high-temperature techniques, have been detected in diamond as individual atoms; the maximum concentration is 0.01% for nickel&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order of increasing rarity, yellow diamond is followed by brown, colorless, then by blue, green, black, pink, orange, purple, and red.&lt;ref name=harlow/&gt; "Black", or [[Carbonado]], diamonds are not truly black, but rather contain numerous dark inclusions that give the gems their dark appearance. Colored diamonds contain impurities or structural defects that cause the coloration, while pure or nearly pure diamonds are transparent and colorless. Most diamond impurities replace a carbon atom in the [[crystal lattice]], known as a [[carbon flaw]]. The most common impurity, nitrogen, causes a slight to intense yellow coloration depending upon the type and concentration of nitrogen present.&lt;ref name=harlow/&gt; The [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA) classifies low saturation yellow and brown diamonds as diamonds in the ''normal color range'', and applies a grading scale from "D" (colorless) to "Z" (light yellow). Diamonds of a different color, such as blue, are called ''fancy colored'' diamonds and fall under a different grading scale.&lt;ref name=harlow/&gt;

===Identification===
Diamonds can be identified by their high thermal conductivity. Their high [[refractive index]] is also indicative, but other materials have similar refractivity. Diamonds cut glass, but this does not positively identify a diamond because other materials, such as quartz, also lie above glass on the [[Mohs scale]] and can also cut it. Diamonds can scratch other diamonds, but this can result in damage to one or both stones. Hardness tests are infrequently used in practical gemology because of their potentially destructive nature.&lt;ref name=read/&gt; The extreme hardness and high value of diamond means that gems are typically polished slowly, using painstaking traditional techniques and greater attention to detail than is the case with most other gemstones;&lt;ref name=hazen&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fNJQok6N9_MC&amp;pg=PA7|pages=7–10|title=The diamond makers|last=Hazen | first= R. M.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-521-65474-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; these tend to result in extremely flat, highly polished facets with exceptionally sharp facet edges. Diamonds also possess an extremely high refractive index and fairly high dispersion. Taken together, these factors affect the overall appearance of a polished diamond and most [[diamantaires]] still rely upon skilled use of a [[loupe]] (magnifying glass) to identify diamonds "by eye".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Jm3FwBiHaI4C&amp;pg=PA37|pages=34–37|title=Synthetic, Imitation and Treated Gemstones|last=O'Donoghue | first= M.|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|year= 1997|isbn=0-7506-3173-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most diamonds come from the [[Mantle (geology)|Earth's mantle]], and most of this section discusses those diamonds. However, there are other sources. Some blocks of the crust, or [[terrane]]s, have been buried deep enough as the crust thickened so they experienced [[ultra-high-pressure metamorphism]].

A common misconception is that diamonds are formed from highly compressed [[coal]]. Coal is formed from buried prehistoric plants, and most diamonds that have been dated are far older than the first [[Embryophyte|land plants]]. It is possible that diamonds can form from coal in [[subduction zone]]s, but diamonds formed in this way are rare, and the carbon source is more likely [[carbonate]] rocks and organic carbon in sediments, rather than coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Surface distribution===
[[File:World geologic provinces.jpg|thumb|[[Geologic province]]s of the world. The pink and orange areas are [[shield (geology)|shields]] and [[Platform (geology)|platforms]], which together constitute cratons.]]
Diamonds are far from evenly distributed over the Earth. A rule of thumb known as Clifford's rule states that they are almost always found in kimberlites on the oldest part of [[craton]]s, the stable cores of continents with typical ages of 2.5 billion years or more.&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pohl"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pohl|first1=Walter L.|title=Economic Geology: Principles and Practice|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444394863}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|314}} However, there are exceptions. The [[Argyle diamond mine]] in [[Australia]], the largest producer of diamonds by weight in the world, is located in a ''mobile belt'', also known as an ''[[orogeny|orogenic belt]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Allaby|first1=Michael|title=mobile belt |encyclopedia=A dictionary of geology and earth sciences|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780191744334|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; a weaker zone surrounding the central craton that has undergone compressional tectonics. Instead of kimberlite, the host rock is [[lamproite]]. Lamproites with diamonds that are not economically viable are also found in the United States, India and Australia.&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt; In addition,  diamonds in the [[Algoman orogeny|Wawa belt]] of the Superior province in [[Canada]] and microdiamonds in the [[Northeastern Japan arc|island arc of Japan]] are found in a type of rock called [[lamprophyre]].&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt;

Kimberlites can be found in narrow (1&amp;ndash;4 meters) dikes and sills, and in pipes with diameters that range from about 75 meters to 1.5 kilometers. Fresh rock is dark bluish green to greenish gray, but after exposure rapidly turns brown and crumbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kjarsgaard|first1=B. A.|chapter=Kimberlite pipe models: significance for exploration|editor-last1=Milkereit|editor-first1=B.|title=Proceedings of Exploration 07: Fifth Decennial International Conference on Mineral Exploration|date=2007|publisher=[[Decennial Mineral Exploration Conferences]], 2007|pages=667&amp;ndash;677|url=http://www.dmec.ca/ex07-dvd/E07/pdfs/46.pdf|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hybrid rock with a chaotic mixture of small minerals and rock fragments ([[clastic rock|clasts]]) up to the size of watermelons. They are a mixture of [[xenocryst]]s and [[xenolith]]s (minerals and rocks carried up from the lower crust and mantle), pieces of surface rock, altered minerals such as [[Serpentine subgroup|serpentine]], and new minerals that crystallized during the eruption. The texture varies with depth. The composition forms a continuum with [[carbonatite]]s, but the latter have too much oxygen for carbon to exist in a pure form. Instead, it is locked up in the mineral [[calcite]] ([[calcium|Ca]][[carbon|C]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt;

All three of the diamond-bearing rocks (kimberlite, lamproite and lamprophyre) lack certain minerals ([[melilite]] and [[kalsilite]]) that are incompatible with diamond formation. In kimberlite, [[olivine]] is large and conspicuous, while lamproite has Ti-[[phlogopite]] and lamprophyre has [[biotite]] and [[amphibole]]. They are all derived from magma types that erupt rapidly from small amounts of melt, are rich in [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatiles]] and [[magnesium oxide]], and are less [[redox|oxidizing]] than more common mantle melts such as [[basalt]]. These characteristics allow the melts to carry diamonds to the surface before they dissolve.&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt;

===Exploration===
[[File:Diavik Mine.tif|thumb|upright|Diavik Mine, on an island in Lac de Gras in northern Canada.]]
Kimberlite pipes can be difficult to find. They weather quickly (within a few years after exposure) and tend to have lower topographic relief than surrounding rock. If they are visible in outcrops, the diamonds are never visible because they are so rare. In any case, kimberlites are often covered with vegetation, sediments, soils or lakes. In modern searches, [[geophysical survey|geophysical methods]] such as [[aeromagnetic survey]]s, [[Electrical resistivity tomography|electrical resistivity]] and [[gravimetry]], help identify promising regions to explore. This is aided by isotopic dating and modeling of the geological history. Then surveyors must go to the area and collect samples, looking for kimberlite fragments or ''indicator minerals''. The latter have compositions that reflect the conditions where diamonds form, such as extreme melt depletion or high pressures in [[eclogite]]s. However, indicator minerals can be misleading; a better approach is [[geothermobarometry]], where the compositions of minerals are analyzed as if they were in equilibrium with mantle minerals.&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt;

Finding kimberlites requires persistence, and only a small fraction contain diamonds that are commercially viable. The only major discoveries since about 1980 have been in Canada. Since existing mines have lifetimes of as little as 25 years, there could be a shortage of new diamonds in the future.&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt;

===Ages===
Diamonds are dated by analyzing inclusions using the decay of radioactive isotopes. Depending on the elemental abundances, one can look at the decay of [[Rubidium–strontium dating|rubidium to strontium]], [[Samarium–neodymium dating|samarium to neodymium]], [[Uranium–lead dating|uranium to lead]], [[Argon–argon dating|argon-40 to argon-39]], or [[Rhenium–osmium dating|rhenium to osmium]]. Those found in kimberlites have ages ranging from 1 to 3.5 billion years, and there can be multiple ages in the same kimberlite, indicating multiple episodes of diamond formation. The kimberlites themselves are much younger. Most of them have ages between tens of millions and 300 million years old, although there are some older exceptions (Argyle, [[Premier Mine|Premier]] and Wawa). Thus, the kimberlites formed independently of the diamonds and served only to transport them to the surface.&lt;ref name=Cartigny/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt; Kimberlites are also much younger than the cratons they have erupted through. The reason for the lack of older kimberlites is unknown, but it suggests there was some change in mantle chemistry or tectonics. No kimberlite has erupted in human history.&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt;

===Origin in mantle===
[[File:Eclogite, détail de la roche.jpg|thumb|Eclogite with centimeter-size garnet crystals.]]
Most gem-quality diamonds come from depths of 150 to 250 kilometers in the lithosphere. Such depths occur below cratons in ''mantle keels'', the thickest part of the lithosphere. These regions have high enough pressure and temperature to allow diamonds to form and they are not convecting, so diamonds can be stored for billions of years until a kimberlite eruption samples them.&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt;

Host rocks in a mantle keel include [[harzburgite]] and [[lherzolite]], two type of [[peridotite]]. The most dominant rock type in the upper mantle, peridotite is an [[igneous rock]] consisting mostly of the minerals [[olivine]] and [[pyroxene]]; it is low in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] and high in [[magnesium]]. However, diamonds in peridotite rarely survive the trip to the surface.&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt; Another common source that does keep diamonds intact is [[eclogite]], a [[metamorphic]] rock that typically forms from [[basalt]] as an oceanic plate plunges into the mantle at a [[Subduction|subduction zone]].&lt;ref name=Cartigny/&gt;

A smaller fraction of diamonds (about 150 have been studied) come from depths of 330&amp;ndash;660 kilometers, a region that includes the [[Transition zone (Earth)|transition zone]]. They formed in eclogite but are distinguished from diamonds of shallower origin by inclusions of [[majorite]] (a form of [[garnet]] with excess silicon). A similar proportion of diamonds comes from the lower mantle at depths between 660 and 800 kilometers.&lt;ref name=Cartigny/&gt;

Diamond is thermodynamically stable at high pressures and temperatures, with the phase transition from [[graphite]] occurring at greater temperatures as the pressure increases. Thus, underneath continents it becomes stable at temperatures of 950 degrees Celsius and pressures of 4.5 gigapascals, corresponding to depths of 150 kilometers or greater. In subduction zones, which are colder, it becomes stable at temperatures of 800 degrees C and pressures of 3.5 gigapascals. At depths greater than 240 km, iron-nickel metal phases are present and carbon is likely to be either dissolved in them or in the form of [[carbide]]s. Thus, the deeper origin of some diamonds may reflect unusual growth environments.&lt;ref name=Cartigny/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt;

In 2018 the first known natural samples of a phase of ice called [[Ice VII]] were found as inclusions in diamond samples. The inclusions formed at depths between 400 and 800 kilometers, straddling the upper and lower mantle, and provide evidence for water-rich fluid at these depths.&lt;ref name=Cartier&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cartier|first1=Kimberly|title=Diamond Impurities Reveal Water Deep Within the Mantle|journal=Eos|date=2 April 2018|volume=99|doi=10.1029/2018EO095949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perkins&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perkins|first1=Sid|title=Pockets of water may lie deep below Earth’s surface|journal=Science|date=8 March 2018|doi=10.1126/science.aat5630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon sources===
The amount of carbon in the mantle is not well constrained, but its concentration is estimated at 0.5 to 1 parts per thousand.&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt; It has two [[Stable nuclide|stable isotopes]], [[Carbon-12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]], in a ratio of approximately 99:1 by mass. This ratio has a wide range in meteorites, which implies that it was probably also broad in the early Earth. It can also be altered by surface processes like [[photosynthesis]]. The fraction is generally compared to a standard sample using a ratio [[Isotopic signature#Carbon isotopes|δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] expressed in parts per thousand. Common rocks from the mantle such as basalts, carbonatites and kimberlites have ratios between -8 and -2. On the surface, organic sediments have an average of -25 while carbonates have an average of 0.&lt;ref name=Cartigny/&gt;

Populations of diamonds from different sources have distributions of δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C that vary markedly. Peridotitic diamonds are mostly within the typical mantle range; eclogitic diamonds have values from -40 to +3, although the peak of the distribution is in the mantle range. This variability implies that they are not formed from carbon that is ''primordial'' (having resided in the mantle since the Earth formed). Instead, they are the result of tectonic processes, although (given the ages of diamonds) not necessarily the same tectonic processes that act in the present.&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt;

===Formation and growth===
Diamonds in the mantle form through a ''[[metasomatism|metasomatic]]'' process where a C-O-H-N-S fluid or melt dissolves minerals in a rock and replaces them with new minerals. (The vague term C-O-H-N-S is commonly used because the exact composition is not known.) Diamonds form from this fluid either by reduction of oxidized carbon (e.g., CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or oxidation of a reduced phase such as [[methane]].&lt;ref name=Cartigny/&gt;

Using probes such as polarized light, [[photoluminescence]] and [[cathodoluminescence]], a series of growth zones can be identified in diamonds. The characteristic pattern in diamonds from the lithosphere involves a nearly concentric series of zones with very thin oscillations in luminescence and alternating episodes where the carbon is resorbed by the fluid and then grown again. Diamonds from below the lithosphere have a more irregular, almost polycrystalline texture, reflecting the higher temperatures and pressures as well as the transport of the diamonds by convection.&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt;

===Transport to the surface===
[[File:VolcanicPipe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Diagram of a volcanic pipe]]
Geological evidence supports a model in which kimberlite magma rose at 4&amp;ndash;20 meters per second, creating an upward path by [[hydraulic fracturing]] of the rock. As the pressure decreases, a vapor phase [[exsolution|exsolves]] from the magma, and this helps to keep the magma fluid. At the surface, the initial eruption explodes out through fissures at high speeds (over 200 meters per second). Then, at lower pressures, the rock is eroded, forming a pipe and producing fragmented rock ([[breccia]]). As the eruption wanes, there is [[pyroclastic]] phase and then metamorphism and hydration produces [[serpentinite]]s.&lt;ref name=Shirey2013/&gt;

===In space===
{{Main|Extraterrestrial diamonds}}
Although diamonds on [[Earth]] are rare, they are very common in space. In [[meteorite]]s, about 3 percent of the carbon is in the form of [[nanodiamond]]s, having diameters of a few nanometers. Sufficiently small diamonds can form in the cold of space because their lower [[surface energy]] makes them more stable than graphite. The isotopic signatures of some nanodiamonds indicate they were formed outside the Solar System in stars.&lt;ref name=Tielens&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tielens |first1=A. G. G.

The most familiar uses of diamonds today are as gemstones used for [[adornment]], and as industrial abrasives for cutting hard materials. The markets for gem-grade and industrial-grade diamonds value diamonds differently.

===Gem-grade diamonds===
{{Main|Diamond (gemstone)}}

The [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of white light into [[spectral color]]s is the primary gemological characteristic of gem diamonds. In the 20th century, experts in gemology developed methods of grading diamonds and other gemstones based on the characteristics most important to their value as a gem. Four characteristics, known informally as the ''four Cs'', are now commonly used as the basic descriptors of diamonds: these are its mass in ''[[Carat (unit)|carats]]'' (a carat begin equal to 0.2 grams), ''[[Diamond cut|cut]]'' (quality of the cut is graded according to [[aspect ratio|proportions]], [[symmetry]] and [[polishing|polish]]), ''[[Diamond color|color]]'' (how close to white or colorless; for fancy diamonds how intense is its hue), and ''[[Diamond clarity|clarity]]'' (how free is it from [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]]). A large, flawless diamond is known as a [[Paragon (diamond)|paragon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DIWEi5Hg93gC&amp;pg=PA42|page=42|last=Hesse|first= R. W.|title=Jewelrymaking through history| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| year= 2007|isbn=0-313-33507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large trade in gem-grade diamonds exists. Although most gem-grade diamonds are sold newly polished, there is a well-established market for resale of polished diamonds (e.g. pawnbroking, auctions, second-hand jewelry stores, diamantaires, bourses, etc.). One hallmark of the trade in gem-quality diamonds is its remarkable concentration: wholesale trade and diamond cutting is limited to just a few locations; in 2003, 92% of the world's diamonds were cut and polished in [[Surat]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;

One contributory factor is the geological nature of diamond deposits: several large primary kimberlite-pipe mines each account for significant portions of market share (such as the [[Jwaneng diamond mine|Jwaneng mine]] in Botswana, which is a single large-pit mine that can produce between {{convert|12500000|and|15000000|carat|kg}} of diamonds per year&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Secondary alluvial diamond deposits, on the other hand, tend to be fragmented amongst many different operators because they can be dispersed over many hundreds of square kilometers (e.g., alluvial deposits in Brazil).

The production and distribution of diamonds is largely consolidated in the hands of a few key players, and concentrated in traditional diamond trading centers, the most important being Antwerp, where 80% of all rough diamonds, 50% of all cut diamonds and more than 50% of all rough, cut and industrial diamonds combined are handled.&lt;ref name=India&gt;

The [[De Beers]] company, as the world's largest diamond mining company, holds a dominant position in the industry, and has done so since soon after its founding in 1888 by the British imperialist [[Cecil Rhodes]]. De Beers is currently the world's largest operator of diamond production facilities (mines) and [[Distribution (business)|distribution channels]] for gem-quality diamonds. The Diamond Trading Company (DTC) is a subsidiary of De Beers and markets rough diamonds from De Beers-operated mines. De Beers and its subsidiaries own mines that produce some 40% of annual world diamond production. For most of the 20th century over 80% of the world's rough diamonds passed through De Beers,&lt;ref&gt;

Further down the supply chain, members of The [[World Federation of Diamond Bourses]] (WFDB) act as a medium for wholesale diamond exchange, trading both polished and rough diamonds. The WFDB consists of independent diamond bourses in major cutting centers such as Tel Aviv, Antwerp, Johannesburg and other cities across the USA, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name=harlow/&gt; In 2000, the WFDB and The International Diamond Manufacturers Association established the [[World Diamond Council]] to prevent the trading of diamonds used to fund war and inhumane acts. WFDB's additional activities include sponsoring the [[World Diamond Congress]] every two years, as well as the establishment of the ''[[International Diamond Council]]'' (IDC) to oversee diamond grading.

Once purchased by Sightholders (which is a trademark term referring to the companies that have a three-year supply contract with DTC), diamonds are cut and polished in preparation for sale as gemstones ('industrial' stones are regarded as a by-product of the gemstone market; they are used for abrasives).&lt;ref name=polish&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fkBJ0HL34WsC&amp;pg=PA297 | pages = 297–299 | title = Africa's silk road | last1 = Broadman | first1 = H.

Recently, diamond cutting centers have been established in China, India, [[Thailand]], Namibia and Botswana.&lt;ref name=polish/&gt; Cutting centers with lower cost of labor, notably Surat in [[Gujarat|Gujarat, India]], handle a larger number of smaller carat diamonds, while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds are more likely to be handled in Europe or North America. The recent expansion of this industry in India, employing low cost labor, has allowed smaller diamonds to be prepared as gems in greater quantities than was previously economically feasible.&lt;ref name="India" /&gt;

Diamonds prepared as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called ''bourses''. There are 28 registered diamond bourses in the world.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourses are the final tightly controlled step in the diamond supply chain; wholesalers and even retailers are able to buy relatively small lots of diamonds at the bourses, after which they are prepared for final sale to the consumer. Diamonds can be sold already set in jewelry, or sold unset ("loose"). According to the Rio Tinto Group, in 2002 the diamonds produced and released to the market were valued at US$9&amp;nbsp;billion as rough diamonds, US$14&amp;nbsp;billion after being cut and polished, US$28&amp;nbsp;billion in wholesale diamond jewelry, and US$57&amp;nbsp;billion in retail sales.&lt;ref&gt;

Mined rough diamonds are converted into gems through a multi-step process called "cutting".
Diamonds are extremely hard, but also brittle and can be split up by a single blow. Therefore, diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills, scientific knowledge, tools and experience. Its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond luster, that is dispersion of white light, whereas the number and area of facets would determine the weight of the final product. The weight reduction upon cutting is significant and can be of the order of 50%.&lt;ref name=x50&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=jPT6JADCqgwC&amp;pg=PA280 | page = 280 | title = Handbook of carbon, graphite, diamond, and fullerenes: properties, processing, and applications | last = Pierson | first = Hugh O. | publisher = William Andrew | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-8155-1339-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several possible shapes are considered, but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific, but also practical considerations. For example, the diamond might be intended for display or for wear, in a ring or a necklace, singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape.&lt;ref name=antique&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Y84qRt6nz-8C&amp;pg=PA88 | pages = 82–102 | title = Antique jewellery: its manufacture, materials and design | last = James | first = Duncan S. | publisher = Osprey Publishing | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-7478-0385-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them may be considered as classical, such as [[Diamond cut|round]], [[Pear Cut Diamond|pear]], [[Marquise Diamond|marquise]], [[Oval Cut Diamond|oval]], [[hearts and arrows]] diamonds, etc. Some of them are special, produced by certain companies, for example, [[Phoenix Cut Diamond|Phoenix]], [[Cushion Cut Diamond|Cushion]], [[Sole Mio Cut Diamond|Sole Mio]] diamonds, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kristallsmolensk.com/backstage/benchmarks/shapes/|title=The Classical and Special Shapes of Diamonds|publisher=kristallsmolensk.com|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most time-consuming part of the cutting is the preliminary analysis of the rough stone. It needs to address a large number of issues, bears much responsibility, and therefore can last years in case of unique diamonds. The following issues are considered:
*The hardness of diamond and its ability to cleave strongly depend on the crystal orientation. Therefore, the crystallographic structure of the diamond to be cut is analyzed using [[X-ray diffraction]] to choose the optimal cutting directions.
*Most diamonds contain visible non-diamond inclusions and crystal flaws. The cutter has to decide which flaws are to be removed by the cutting and which could be kept.
*The diamond can be split by a single, well calculated blow of a hammer to a pointed tool, which is quick, but risky. Alternatively, it can be cut with a [[diamond saw]], which is a more reliable but tedious procedure.&lt;ref name=antique/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=X3qe9jzYUAQC&amp;pg=PA984 | pages = 984–992 | title = Handbook of industrial diamonds and diamond films|last1 = Prelas | first1 = Mark Antonio | last2 = Popovici | first2 = Galina | last3 = Bigelow | first3 = Louis K. | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-8247-9994-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After initial cutting, the diamond is shaped in numerous stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, which is a responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=i9kDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA760 | pages = 760–764 | title = Gem Cutting | journal = [[Popular Mechanics]] | year = 1940 | volume = 74 | issue = 5 | issn = 0032-4558 | publisher = Hearst Magazines }}&lt;/ref&gt; After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various [[diamond enhancement]] techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.&lt;ref name=read&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC&amp;pg=PA166 | pages = 165–166 | title = Gemmology | last = Read | first = P.

====Marketing====
[[File:Diamond Balance Scale 0.01 - 25 Carats Jewelers Measuring Tool.jpg|thumb|Diamond Balance Scale 0.01 - 25 Carats Jewelers Measuring Tool]]
Marketing has significantly affected the image of diamond as a valuable commodity.

[[N. W. Ayer &amp; Son]], the advertising firm retained by [[De Beers]] in the mid-20th century, succeeded in reviving the American diamond market. And the firm created new markets in countries where no diamond tradition had existed before. N. W. Ayer's marketing included [[product placement]], advertising focused on the diamond product itself rather than the De Beers brand, and associations with celebrities and royalty. Without advertising the De Beers brand, De Beers was advertising its competitors' diamond products as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamonds.net/news/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=33243 |title=Keep the Diamond Dream Alive | first = Martin | last = Rapaport | work = Rapaport Magazine | publisher = Diamonds.net |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was not a concern as De Beers dominated the diamond market throughout the 20th century. De Beers' market share dipped temporarily to 2nd place in the global market below Alrosa in the aftermath of the global economic crisis of 2008, down to less than 29% in terms of carats mined, rather than sold.&lt;ref name="jckonline.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=JCK Staff |url=http://www.jckonline.com/2011/01/26/10-things-rocking-industry |title=10 Things Rocking the Industry |work=JCK |publisher=Jckonline.com |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=September 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107102249/http://www.jckonline.com/2011/01/26/10-things-rocking-industry |archivedate=January 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign lasted for decades but was effectively discontinued by early 2011. De Beers still advertises diamonds, but the advertising now mostly promotes its own brands, or licensed product lines, rather than completely "generic" diamond products.&lt;ref name="jckonline.com"/&gt;  The campaign was perhaps best captured by the slogan "[[a diamond is forever]]".&lt;ref name=sell /&gt;  This slogan is now being used by De Beers Diamond Jewelers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bates |first=Rob |url=http://www.jckonline.com/blogs/cutting-remarks/2011/01/14/interview-forevermark-ceo |title=Interview with Forevermark CEO |work=JCK |publisher=Jckonline.com |date=January 14, 2011 |accessdate=September 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128004942/http://www.jckonline.com/blogs/cutting-remarks/2011/01/14/interview-forevermark-ceo |archivedate=November 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a jewelry firm which is a 50%/50% joint venture between the De Beers mining company and [[LVMH]], the luxury goods conglomerate.

Brown-colored diamonds constituted a significant part of the diamond production, and were predominantly used for industrial purposes. They were seen as worthless for jewelry (not even being assessed on the [[diamond color]] scale). After the development of Argyle diamond mine in Australia in 1986, and marketing, brown diamonds have become acceptable gems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_WI86J88ydAC&amp;pg=PA34|page=34|title=The nature of diamonds|first=George E. | last = Harlow|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-521-62935-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zNicdkuulE4C&amp;pg=PA416|page=416|title=Industrial minerals &amp; rocks|first = Jessica Elzea | last = Kogel|publisher= Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration (U.S.)|year=2006|isbn=0-87335-233-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change was mostly due to the numbers: the Argyle mine, with its {{convert|35000000|carat|kg}} of diamonds per year, makes about one-third of global production of natural diamonds;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=August 4, 2009 |url=http://www.costellos.com.au/diamonds/industry.html |title=The Australian Diamond Industry |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716170624/http://www.costellos.com.au/diamonds/industry.html |archivedate=July 16, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of Argyle diamonds are brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=068-M3xrDSQC&amp;pg=PT158 | page = 158 | title = Diamond deposits: origin, exploration, and history of discovery | last1 = Erlich | first1 = Edward | last2 = Dan Hausel| first2 = W.| publisher = SME | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-87335-213-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and thermal conductivity, making many of the gemological characteristics of diamonds, such as the [[4 Cs]], irrelevant for most applications. 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about {{convert|135000000|carat|kg}} annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones and are used industrially.&lt;ref name="minerals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minerals.net/mineral/diamond.aspx|title=Diamond: The mineral Diamond information and pictures|publisher=minerals.net|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to mined diamonds, synthetic diamonds found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another {{convert|570000000|carat|kg}} of synthetic diamond is produced annually for industrial use (in 2004; in 2014 it is {{convert|4500000000|carat|kg}}, 90% of which is produced in China). Approximately 90% of diamond [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding grit]] is currently of synthetic origin.&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;

The boundary between gem-quality diamonds and industrial diamonds is poorly defined and partly depends on market conditions (for example, if demand for polished diamonds is high, some lower-grade stones will be polished into low-quality or small gemstones rather than being sold for industrial use). Within the category of industrial diamonds, there is a sub-category comprising the lowest-quality, mostly opaque stones, which are known as [[bort]].&lt;ref name=spear&gt;

Industrial use of diamonds has historically been associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond can be used to polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped [[drill bit]]s and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an [[abrasive]]. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes.&lt;ref&gt;

Roughly 49% of diamonds originate from [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]], although significant sources of the mineral have been discovered in [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Russia]], [[Brazil]], and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt; They are mined from kimberlite and lamproite volcanic pipes, which can bring diamond crystals, originating from deep within the Earth where high pressures and temperatures enable them to form, to the surface. The mining and distribution of natural diamonds are subjects of frequent controversy such as concerns over the sale of ''[[blood diamond]]s'' or ''conflict diamonds'' by African [[paramilitary]] groups.&lt;ref name=conflict&gt;

Only a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care is required not to destroy larger diamonds, and then sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of [[X-ray fluorescence]], after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of [[X-ray]]s became commonplace,&lt;ref name=x50/&gt; the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.&lt;ref name=harlow&gt;

{{Main|Kimberley Process|Blood diamond|Child labour in the diamond industry}}
In some of the more politically unstable central African and west African countries, revolutionary groups have taken control of [[List of diamond mines|diamond mines]], using proceeds from diamond sales to finance their operations. Diamonds sold through this process are known as ''conflict diamonds'' or ''blood diamonds''.&lt;ref name=conflict/&gt;

In response to public concerns that their diamond purchases were contributing to war and [[human rights abuses]] in [[central Africa|central]] and [[West Africa|western]] Africa, the [[United Nations]], the diamond industry and diamond-trading nations introduced the [[Kimberley Process]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=kimb&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hWrEcl2ydzEC&amp;pg=PA305|pages=305–313|title=Resource politics in Sub-Saharan Africa|last1 = Basedau | first1 = M. | last2 = Mehler | first2 = A. | year = 2005 | publisher = GIGA-Hamburg|isbn=3-928049-91-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kimberley Process aims to ensure that conflict diamonds do not become intermixed with the diamonds not controlled by such rebel groups. This is done by requiring diamond-producing countries to provide proof that the money they make from selling the diamonds is not used to fund criminal or revolutionary activities. Although the Kimberley Process has been moderately successful in limiting the number of conflict diamonds entering the market, some still find their way in. According to the International Diamond Manufacturers Association, conflict diamonds constitute 2–3% of all diamonds traded.&lt;ref&gt;

Two are pale blue, one is pale yellow, one is green-blue, one is dark blue and one green-yellow.|Synthetic diamonds of various colors grown by the high-pressure high-temperature technique]]
Synthetic diamonds are diamonds manufactured in a laboratory, as opposed to diamonds mined from the Earth. The gemological and industrial uses of diamond have created a large demand for rough stones. This demand has been satisfied in large part by synthetic diamonds, which have been manufactured by various processes for more than half a century. However, in recent years it has become possible to produce gem-quality synthetic diamonds of significant size.&lt;ref name="AMNH"/&gt;  It is possible to make colorless synthetic gemstones that, on a molecular level, are identical to natural stones and so visually similar that only a gemologist with special equipment can tell the difference.&lt;ref name="bain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bain.com/Images/PR_BAIN_REPORT_The_global_diamond_industry.pdf|title=The Global Diamond Industry: Lifting the Veil of Mystery|publisher=[[Bain and Company|Bain &amp; Company]]|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular method of growing synthetic diamond is [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 [[methane]] to [[hydrogen]]) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]] in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] ignited by [[microwaves]], [[hot filament]], [[Electric arc|arc discharge]], [[welding torch]] or [[laser]].&lt;ref name=CVD&gt;

===Simulants===
{{Main|Diamond simulant}}
[[File:Moissanite ring.JPG|thumb|alt=A round sparkling, clear gemstone with many facets.|Gem-cut synthetic silicon carbide set in a ring]]
A diamond simulant is a non-diamond material that is used to simulate the appearance of a diamond, and may be referred to as diamante. [[Cubic zirconia]] is the most common. The gemstone [[moissanite]] (silicon carbide) can be treated as a diamond simulant, though more costly to produce than cubic zirconia. Both are produced synthetically.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enhancements===
{{Main|Diamond enhancement}}
Diamond enhancements are specific treatments performed on natural or synthetic diamonds (usually those already cut and polished into a gem), which are designed to better the gemological characteristics of the stone in one or more ways. These include laser drilling to remove inclusions, application of sealants to fill cracks, treatments to improve a white diamond's color grade, and treatments to give fancy color to a white diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kCc80Q4gzSgC&amp;pg=PA115|page=115|title=The diamond formula|last = Barnard | first =  A. S. |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2000|isbn=0-7506-4244-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coatings are increasingly used to give a diamond simulant such as cubic zirconia a more "diamond-like" appearance. One such substance is [[diamond-like carbon]]—an amorphous carbonaceous material that has some physical properties similar to those of the diamond. Advertising suggests that such a coating would transfer some of these diamond-like properties to the coated stone, hence enhancing the diamond simulant. Techniques such as [[Raman spectroscopy]] should easily identify such a treatment.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===
Early diamond identification tests included a scratch test relying on the superior hardness of diamond. This test is destructive, as a diamond can scratch another diamond, and is rarely used nowadays. Instead, diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity. Electronic thermal probes are widely used in the gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered [[thermistor]]s mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | inventor1-first = J. F. | inventor1-last = Wenckus | country = US | number = 4488821 | title = Method and means of rapidly distinguishing a simulated diamond from natural diamond | pubdate = December 18, 1984 | fdate = 1982-11-24 | pridate = 1981-03-03 | assign1 = Ceres Electronics Corporation }}; {{US patent|4488821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the thermal probe can separate diamonds from most of their simulants, distinguishing between various types of diamond, for example synthetic or natural, irradiated or non-irradiated, etc., requires more advanced, optical techniques. Those techniques are also used for some diamonds simulants, such as silicon carbide, which pass the thermal conductivity test. Optical techniques can distinguish between natural diamonds and synthetic diamonds. They can also identify the vast majority of treated natural diamonds.&lt;ref name=raman&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W2cSkEsWbSkC&amp;pg=PA387|pages=387–394|title=Raman spectroscopy in archaeology and art history|last1 = Edwards | first1 = H.

M|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|year=2005|isbn=0-85404-522-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Perfect" crystals (at the atomic lattice level) have never been found, so both natural and synthetic diamonds always possess characteristic imperfections, arising from the circumstances of their crystal growth, that allow them to be distinguished from each other.&lt;ref name=spot/&gt;

Laboratories use techniques such as spectroscopy, microscopy and luminescence under shortwave ultraviolet light to determine a diamond's origin.&lt;ref name=raman/&gt; They also use specially made instruments to aid them in the identification process. Two screening instruments are the ''DiamondSure'' and the ''DiamondView'', both produced by the [[Diamond Trading Company|DTC]] and marketed by the GIA.&lt;ref&gt;

Several methods for identifying synthetic diamonds can be performed, depending on the method of production and the color of the diamond. CVD diamonds can usually be identified by an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the [[Swiss Gemmological Institute]]'s&lt;ref&gt;

Screening devices based on diamond type detection can be used to make a distinction between diamonds that are certainly natural and diamonds that are potentially synthetic. Those potentially synthetic diamonds require more investigation in a specialized lab. Examples of commercial screening devices are D-Screen (WTOCD / HRD Antwerp) and Alpha Diamond Analyzer (Bruker / HRD Antwerp).

==Stolen diamonds==
Occasionally large thefts of diamonds take place. In February 2013 armed robbers carried out a [[Brussels Airport diamond heist|raid at Brussels Airport]] and escaped with gems estimated to be worth $50m (£32m; 37m euros). The gang broke through a perimeter fence and raided the cargo hold of a Swiss-bound plane. The gang have since been arrested and large amounts of cash and diamonds recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22447516 | work=BBC News | title=Arrests over $50m Belgium airport diamond heist | date=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification of stolen diamonds presents a set of difficult problems. Rough diamonds will have a distinctive shape depending on whether their source is a mine or from an alluvial environment such as a beach or river—alluvial diamonds have smoother surfaces than those that have been mined. Determining the provenance of cut and polished stones is much more complex.

The [[Kimberley Process]] was developed to monitor the trade in rough diamonds and prevent their being used to fund violence. Before exporting, rough diamonds are certificated by the government of the country of origin. Some countries, such as Venezuela, are not party to the agreement. The Kimberley Process does not apply to local sales of rough diamonds within a country.

Diamonds may be etched by laser with marks invisible to the naked eye. [[Lazare Kaplan International|Lazare Kaplan]], a US-based company, developed this method. However, whatever is marked on a diamond can readily be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21525403 | work=BBC News | title=Who, What, Why: How do you spot a stolen diamond? | date=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21504112 | work=BBC News | title=Brussels diamond robbery nets 'gigantic' haul | date=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Diamond (gemstone)}}
The name ''diamond'' is derived from the ancient Greek ''αδάμας'' ''(adámas''), "proper", "unalterable", "unbreakable", "untamed", from [[:wiktionary:ἀ-|ἀ-]] (a-), "un-" + ''δαμάω'' (''damáō''), "I overpower", "I tame".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamonds are thought to have been first recognized and mined in [[India]], where significant [[alluvial deposit]]s of the stone could be found many centuries ago along the rivers [[Penner River|Penner]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Godavari River|Godavari]]. Diamonds have been known in India for at least 3,000 years but most likely 6,000 years.&lt;ref name=hershey&gt;

In 1772, the French scientist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] used a lens to concentrate the rays of the sun on a diamond in an atmosphere of [[oxygen]], and showed that the only product of the combustion was [[carbon dioxide]], proving that diamond is composed of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;See:

'''EDELWEISS''' ( '''E'''xpérience pour '''DE'''tecter '''L'''es '''W'''IMPs '''E'''n '''S'''ite '''S'''outerrain) is a [[dark matter]] search experiment located at the [[Modane Underground Laboratory]] in France. The experiment uses [[cryogenic detectors]], measuring both the [[phonon]] and [[ionization]] signals produced by particle interactions in [[germanium]] crystals. This technique allows nuclear recoils events to be distinguished from electron recoil events.

The [[European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array|EURECA]] project is a proposed future dark matter experiment, which will involve researchers from EDELWEISS and the [[Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers|CRESST]] dark matter search.

== Dark matter ==
{{Main|dark matter}}

Dark matter is material which does not emit or absorb light. Measurements of the [[rotation curves]] of [[spiral galaxies]] suggest it makes up the majority of the mass of galaxies; and precision measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] suggest it accounts for a significant fraction of the density of the Universe.

A possible explanation of dark matter comes from [[particle physics]]. WIMP ([[Weakly Interacting Massive Particle]]) is a general term for hypothetical particles which interact only through the [[weak interaction|weak nuclear]] and [[gravitation|gravitational force]]. This theory suggests our galaxy is surrounded by a dark halo of such particles. EDELWEISS is one of a number of dark matter search experiments aiming to directly detect WIMP dark matter, by detecting the elastic scattering of a WIMP off an atom within a particle detector. As the interaction rate is so low, this requires sensitive detectors, good background discrimination, and a deep underground site (to reduce the background from [[cosmic rays]]).

==Experiment==
EDELWEISS is located in the Modane underground laboratory, in the Fréjus road tunnel between France and Italy, below 1800m of rock. A 20&amp;nbsp;cm [[lead]] shield reduces the gamma background, and a [[polyethylene]] shield reduces the [[neutron]] flux. All materials close to the detectors are screened for radiopurity. A [[dilution refrigerator]] is used to cool the detectors, built in the opposite orientation to most instruments with the detectors at the top and the refrigeration mechanism below.

EDELWEISS uses high purity [[germanium]] cryogenic bolometers cooled to 20 milliKelvin above absolute zero. The [[phonon]] and [[ionization]] signals produced by a particle interaction are measured. This allows background events to be rejected as nuclear recoils events (produced by WIMP or neutron interactions) produce much less ionization than electron recoil events (produced by alpha, beta and gamma radiation). The detectors are similar to those used by the [[Cryogenic Dark Matter Search|CDMS]] experiment. Simultaneous detection of ionization and heat with semiconductors at low temperature was an original idea by [[Lawrence M. Krauss]], [[Mark Srednicki]] and [[Frank Wilczek]].&lt;ref name="Krauss"&gt;

 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.33.2079
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major limitation of early detectors was the problem of surface events. Due to incomplete charge collection, a particle interaction near the surface of the crystal gave no ionization signal, so electron recoils near the surface could be mistaken for nuclear recoils. To avoid this, the collaboration developed new detectors with interdigitised electrodes. Different voltages are applied to a series of electrodes so the direction of electric field is different near the surface of the crystal, allowing over 99.5% of surface events to be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:eFluor Nanocrystal Vials.jpg|thumb|300px|eFluor Nanocrystals under UV-excitation]]

'''eFluor nanocrystals''' are a class of [[fluorophores]] made of [[semiconductor]] [[quantum dots]]. The nanocrystals can be provided as either primary [[amine]], [[carboxylate]], or non-functional groups on the surface, allowing conjugation to biomolecules of a researcher's choice. The nanocrystals can be conjugated to primary [[antibodies]] which are used for [[flow cytometry]], [[immunohistochemistry]], [[microarrays]], in vivo imaging and [[microscopy]].

==Size==
The optical emission properties of eFluor Nanocrystals are primarily dictated by their size, as discussed in the next section.  There are at least two aspects to consider when discussing the "size" of a quantum dot: the physical size of the semiconductor structure, and the size of the entire quantum dot [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] including the associated [[ligand]]s and hydrophilic coating.  The size of the semiconductor structure is tabulated below, and reflects the diameter of the spherical quantum dot without ligands.  eFluor Nanocrystals are rendered water-dispersable with a patented poly-ethylene glycol ([[Polyethylene glycol|PEG]]) lipid layer that functions as both a protective hydrophilic coating around the quantum dot, as well as reducing non-specific binding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Designing materials for biology and medicine |first=R. |last=Langer |first2=D.A. |last2=Tirrell |journal=Nature |volume=428 |pages=487–492 |date=1 April 2004 |doi=10.1038/nature02388}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By [[dynamic light scattering]] measurements, the [[hydrodynamic radius]] of all eFluor Nanocrystals ranges from 10–13{{nbsp}}nm.

== Properties and structure ==
Quantum dots are unique fluorophores relative to organic [[dye]]s, like [[fluorescein]] or [[rhodamine]] because they are composed of semiconductor metals, instead of a π-conjugated carbon-bonding framework.  With organic dyes, the length of the π-conjugated framework ([[quantum confinement]]), as well as side-groups (electron donating/withdrawing or [[halogens]]) tend to dictate the absorption and emission spectra of the molecule.  Semiconductor quantum dots also work on the concept of quantum confinement, (often referred to as "[[Particle in a Box]]" theory) where an [[exciton]] is formed inside the crystal lattice by an incident [[photon]] of higher energy.  The electron and hole of the exciton have an interaction energy that is tuned by changing the physical size of the quantum dot.  The absorption and emission colors are tuned such that smaller quantum dots confine the exciton into a tighter physical space and increase the energy.  Alternatively, a larger quantum dot confines the exciton into a larger physical space, lowering the interaction energy of the electron and hole, and decreasing the energy of the system.  As shown in the table above, the diameter of the CdSe quantum dots is related to the emission energy such that the smaller quantum dots emit photons toward the blue wavelength range (higher energy) and the larger quantum dots emit photons toward the red wavelength range (lower energy.)

To the right are representative absorption (blue) and emission (red) spectra for the eFluor-605 nanocrystal.

The [[photoluminescence]] spectra of quantum dots are also unique relative to organic dyes in that they are typically [[Gaussian]]-shaped curves with no [[red-tailing]] to the spectrum.  The width of the photoluminescence peak represents the heterogeneity in size dispersion of the quantum dots, where a large size dispersion will lead to broad emission peaks, and tight size-dispersion will lead to narrow emission peaks, often quantified by the [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM) value.  eFluor Nanocrystals are specified at ≤30{{nbsp}}nm FWHM for the CdSe nanocrystals, and ≤70{{nbsp}}nm FWHM for the InGaP eFluor 700 nanocrystals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3726">'''Electrostriction''' (cf. [[magnetostriction]]) is a property of all electrical non-conductors, or [[dielectrics]], that causes them to change their shape under the application of an [[electric field]].

== Explanation ==
Electrostriction is a property of all dielectric materials, and is caused by a slight displacement of [[ion]]s in the crystal lattice upon being exposed to an external electric field. Positive ions will be displaced in the direction of the field, while negative ions will be displaced in the opposite direction. This displacement will accumulate throughout the bulk material and result in an overall strain (elongation) in the direction of the field. The thickness will be reduced in the orthogonal directions characterized by [[Poisson's ratio]]. All insulating materials consisting of more than one type of atom will be ionic to some extent due to the difference of electronegativity of the atoms, and therefore exhibit electrostriction.

The resulting [[strain (materials science)|strain]] (ratio of deformation to the original dimension) is proportional to the square of the [[polarization density|polarization]]. Reversal of the electric field does not reverse the direction of the deformation.

More formally, the electrostriction coefficient is a [[Tensor#Tensor rank|fourth rank]] [[tensor]] (&lt;math&gt;Q_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt;), relating the second-order strain tensor (&lt;math&gt;x_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;) and the first-order electric [[polarization density]] (&lt;math&gt;P_m&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;math&gt;x_{ij} = Q_{ijkl} P_k P_l&lt;/math&gt;

The related [[piezoelectric effect]] occurs only in a particular class of dielectrics.  Electrostriction applies to all crystal symmetries, while the piezoelectric effect only applies to the 20 piezoelectric [[Crystal_structure#Point_groups|point groups]].  Electrostriction is a [[quadratic function|quadratic]] effect, unlike piezoelectricity, which is a [[linear]] effect.

== Materials ==
Although all dielectrics exhibit some electrostriction, certain engineered ceramics, known as [[relaxor ferroelectric]]s, have extraordinarily high electrostrictive constants.  The most commonly used are
* [[lead magnesium niobate]] (PMN)
* [[lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate]] (PMN-PT)
* [[lead lanthanum zirconate titanate]] (PLZT)

== Magnitude of effect ==

Electrostriction can produce a strain of 0.1% at a field strength of 2 million volts per meter (2 MV/m) for the material called PMN-15 (TRS website listed in the references below). The effect appears to be quadratic at low field strengths (up to 0.3 MV/m) and roughly linear after that, up to a maximum field strength of 4 MV/m {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Therefore, devices made of such materials are normally operated around a bias voltage in order to behave nearly linearly. This will probably cause deformations to lead to a change of electric charge, but this is unconfirmed.

== Applications ==

* [[Sonar]] projectors for submarines and surface vessels
* [[Actuator]]s for small displacements

'''Epoxide docosapentaenoic acids''' ('''epoxydocosapentaenoic acids''', '''EDPs''', or '''EpDPEs''') are metabolites of the 22-carbon straight-chain [[omega-3 fatty acid]], [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA).  Cell types that express certain cytochrome P450 (CYP) [[epoxygenase]]s metabolize [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]'s (PUFAs) by converting one of their double bonds to an [[epoxide]].  In the best known of these metabolic pathways, cellular CYP epoxygenases metabolize the 20-carbon straight-chain [[omega-6 fatty acid]], [[arachidonic acid]], to [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]s (EETs); another CYP epoxygenase pathway metabolizes the  20-carbon omega-3 fatty acid, [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), to [[epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid]]s (EEQs). CYP epoxygenases similarly convert various other PUFAs to epoxides (see [[epoxygenase]]) These epoxide metabolites have a variety of activities.  However, essentially all of them are rapidly converted to their corresponding, but in general far less active, [[Vicinal (chemistry)]] dihydroxy fatty acids by ubiquitous cellular [[Soluble epoxide hydrolase]] (sEH; also termed Epoxide hydrolase 2).  Consequently, these epoxides, including EDPs, operate as short-lived signaling agents that regulate the function of their parent or nearby cells.  The particular feature of EDPs (and EEQs) distinguishing them from EETs is that they derive from omega-3 fatty acids and are suggested to be responsible for some of the  beneficial effects attributed to omega-3 fatty acids and omega-3-rich foods such as [[fish oil]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25244930 | year = 2014 | author1 = Fleming | first1 = I | title = The pharmacology of the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase/soluble epoxide hydrolase axis in the vasculature and cardiovascular disease | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 1106–40 | doi = 10.1124/pr.113.007781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
EDPs are [[epoxide]] eicosapentaenoic acid metabolites of DHA.  DHA has 6 cis (see [[Cis–trans isomerism]]) [[Double bond]]s each one of which is located between carbons 4-5, 7-8, 10-11, 13-14, 16-17, or 19-20. Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases attack any one of these double bounds to form a respective docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) epoxide regioisomer (see [[Structural isomer]], section on position isomerism (regioisomerism)).  A given epoxygenase may therefore convert DHA to 4,5-EDP (i.e. 4,5-epoxy-7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 7,8-EDP (i.e. 7,8-epoxy-4''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 10,11-EDP (i.e. 10,11-epoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 13,14-EDP (i.e. 13,14-epoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 16,17-EDP (i.e. 16,17-epoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',19''Z''-DPA, or 19,20-EDP (i.e. 19,20-epoxy-4''Z'', 7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z''-DPA. The epoxygenase enzymes generally form both ''R''/''S'' [[enantiomers]] at each former double bound position; for example, cytochrome P450 epoxidases attack DHA at the 16,17-double bond position to form two epoxide enantiomers, 16''R'',17''S''-EDP and 16''S'',17''S''-EDP.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25093613 | pmc = 4314516 | year = 2015 | author1 = Spector | first1 = A.

==Production==
Enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily that are classified as epoxygenases based on their ability to metabolize PUFA, particularly arachidonic acid, to epoxides include: CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2E, CYP2J, and within the CYP3A subfamily, CYP3A4. In humans, [[CYP2C8]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C19]], [[CYP2J2]], and possibly [[CYP2S1]] [[isoforms]] appear to be the principal epoxygenases responsible for metabolizing arachidonic acid to EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Production]]).  In general, these same CYP epoxygenases also metabolize DHA to EDP (as well as EPA to EEQ; CYP2S1 has not yet been tested for DHA-metabolizing ability), doing so at rates that are often greater than their rates in metabolizing arachidonic acid to EETs; that is, DHA (and EPA) appear to be preferred over arachidonic acid as substrates for many of the CYP epoxygenases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25330284 | year = 2015 | author1 = Frömel | first1 = T | title = Whatever happened to the epoxyeicosatrienoic Acid-like endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor?

H. | doi = 10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.09.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the cited CYP's, [[CYP4A11]], [[CYP4F8]], [[CYP4F12]], [[CYP1A1]], [[CYP1A2]], and [[CYP2E1]], which are classified as CYP monooxygenase rather than CYP epoxygeanses because they metablize arachidonic acid to monohydroxy eicosatetraenoic acids (see [[20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]]), i.e. 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and/or 20-hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid, take on epoxygease activity in converting DHA primarily to 19,20-EDP isomers (see [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]).&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2011. p 16"/&gt; The CYP450 epoxygenases capable of metabolizing DHA to EDPs are wildly distributed in organs and tissues such as the liver, kidney, heart, lung, pancreas, intestine, blood vessels, blood leukocytes, and brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18952572 | pmc = 2674692 | year = 2009 | author1 = Spector | first1 = A. A. | title = Arachidonic acid cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway | journal = The Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 50 Suppl | pages = S52–6 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.R800038-JLR200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23865864 | year = 2013 | author1 = Xu | first1 = M | title = Cytochrome P450 2J2: Distribution, function, regulation, genetic polymorphisms and clinical significance | journal = Drug Metabolism Reviews | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 311–52 | last2 = Ju | first2 = W | last3 = Hao | first3 = H | last4 = Wang | first4 = G | last5 = Li | first5 = P | doi = 10.3109/03602532.2013.806537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These tissues are known to metabolize arachidonic acid to EETs; it has been shown or is presumed that they also metabolize DHA to EPD's.

The EDPs are commonly made by the stimulation of specific cell types by the same mechanisms which produce EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]).  That is, cell stimulation causes DHA to be released from the ''sn-2'' position of their membrane-bound cellular [[phospholipid]] pools through the action of a [[Phospholipase A2]]-type enzyme and the subsequent attack of the released DHA by CYP450 epoxidases. It is notable that the consumption of omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets dramatically raises the serum and tissue levels of EDPs and EEQs in animals as well as humans.  Indeed, this rise in EDP (and EEQ) levels in humans is by far the most prominent change in the profile of PUFA metabolites caused by dietary omega-3 fatty acids and, it is suggested, may be responsible for at least some of the beneficial effects ascribed to dietary omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Lipid Res 1164"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24634501 | pmc = 4031946 | year = 2014 | author1 = Fischer | first1 = R | title = Dietary omega-3 fatty acids modulate the eicosanoid profile in man primarily via the CYP-epoxygenase pathway | journal = The Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 1150–1164 | last2 = Konkel | first2 = A | last3 = Mehling | first3 = H | last4 = Blossey | first4 = K | last5 = Gapelyuk | first5 = A | last6 = Wessel | first6 = N | last7 = von Schacky | first7 = C | last8 = Dechend | first8 = R | last9 = Muller | first9 = D.

==EDP metabolism==
Similar to EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]), EDPs are rapidly metabolized in cells by a cytosolic [[soluble epoxide hydrolase]] (sEH, also termed Epoxide hydrolase 2 [EC 3.2.2.10.]) to form their corresponding [[Vicinal (chemistry)]] [[diol]] dihydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids. Thus, sEH converts 19,20-EDP to 19,10-dihdroxydocosapentaenoic acid (DPA), 16,17-EDP to 16,17-dihydroxy-DPA, 13,14-EDP to 13,14-dihydroxy-DPA, 10,11-EDP to 10,11-dihydroxy-DPA, and 7,8-EDP to 7,8-dihydroxy-EDP; 4,5-EDP is unstable and therefore generally not detected in cells.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23701967 | pmc = 3733540 | year = 2013 | author1 = Harris | first1 = T. R. | title = Soluble epoxide hydrolase: Gene structure, expression and deletion | journal = Gene | volume = 526 | issue = 2 | pages = 61–74 | last2 = Hammock | first2 = B. D. | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dihydroxy-EDP products, like their epoxy precursors, are [[enantiomer]] mixtures; for instance, sEH converts 16,17-EDP to a mixture of 16(''S''),17(''R'')-dihydroxy-DPA and 16(''R''),1y(''S'')-dihydroxy-DPA.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt; These dihydroxy-DPAs typically are far less active than their epoxide precursors.  The sEH pathway acts rapidly and is by far the predominant pathway of EDP inactivation; its operation causes EDPs to function as short-lived mediators whose actions are limited to their parent and nearby cells, i.e. they are [[autocrine]] and [[paracrine]] signaling agents, respectively.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23011468 | year = 2013 | author1 = Bellien | first1 = J | title = Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid pathway in human health and diseases | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 188–96 | last2 = Joannides | first2 = R | doi = 10.1097/FJC.0b013e318273b007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26621325 | year = 2016 | author1 = He | first1 = J | title = Soluble epoxide hydrolase: A potential target for metabolic diseases | journal = Journal of Diabetes | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 305–13 | last2 = Wang | first2 = C | last3 = Zhu | first3 = Y | last4 = Ai | first4 = D | doi = 10.1111/1753-0407.12358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the sEH pathway, EDPs, similar to the EETs, may be acylated into phospholipids in an [[Acylation]]-like reaction; this pathway may serve to limit the action of EETs or store them for future release.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  Finally, again similar to the EETs, EDPs are subject to inactivation by being further metabolized b [[Beta oxidation]].&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25240260 | pmc = 4254344 | year = 2014 | author1 = Wagner | first1 = K | title = The role of long chain fatty acids and their epoxide metabolites in nociceptive signaling | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 113-115 | pages = 2–12 | last2 = Vito | first2 = S | last3 = Inceoglu | first3 = B | last4 = Hammock | first4 = B.

==Clinical significance==
EDPs have not be studied nearly as well as the EETs.  This is particularly the case for animal studies into their potential clinical significance.  In comparison to a selection of the many activities attributed to the EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]), animal studies reported to date find that certain EDPs (16,17-EDP and 19,20-EDP have been most often examined) are: '''1)''' more potent than EETs in decreasing hypertension and pain perception; '''2)''' more potent than or at least equal in potency to the EETs in suppressing inflammation; and '''3)''' act oppositely from the EETs in that EDPs inhibit [[angiogenesis]], endothelial cell migration, endothelial cell proliferation, and the growth and metastasis of human breast and prostate cancer cell lines whereas EETs have stimulatory effects in each of these systems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt; As indicated in the Metabolism section, consumption of omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets dramatically raises the serum and tissue levels of EDPs and EEQs in animals as well as humans and in humans is by far the most prominent change in the profile of PUFA metabolites caused by dietary omega-3 fatty acids. Hence, the metabolism of DHA to EDPs (and EPA to EEQs) may be responsible for at least some of the beneficial effects ascribed to dietary omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Lipid Res 1164"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt;

'''Eugene Franklin Mallove''' (June 9, 1947&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; May 14, 2004) was an American scientist, science writer, editor, and publisher of ''[[Infinite Energy (magazine)|Infinite Energy]]'' magazine, and founder of the nonprofit organization [[New Energy Foundation]].  He was a proponent of [[cold fusion]], and a supporter of its research and related exploratory alternative energy topics, several of which are sometimes characterised as "[[fringe science]]".

Mallove authored ''Fire from Ice'', a book detailing the 1989 report of tabletop [[cold fusion]] from [[Stanley Pons]] and [[Martin Fleischmann]] at the [[University of Utah]]. Among other things, the book claims the team did produce "greater-than-unity" output energy in an experiment successfully replicated on several occasions, but that the results were suppressed through an organized campaign of ridicule from mainstream physicists, including those studying [[Nuclear fusion|controlled thermonuclear fusion]], trying to protect their research and funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Ice-Searching-Behind-Fusion/dp/1892925028|title=Fire from Ice: Searching for the Truth Behind the Cold Fusion Furor|last=Mallove|first=Eugene J.|date=1999-08-01|publisher=Infinite Energy Pr|isbn=9781892925022|location=Concord, NH?|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mallove was murdered in 2004 while cleaning out his former childhood home, which had been rented out. Three people have been arrested and charged in connection with the killing; two were convicted of first-degree manslaughter&lt;ref name = "Norwichbulletin20120420"/&gt; and murder,&lt;ref name="necn2015" /&gt; in 2012 and 2014; the third pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in 2015.&lt;ref name="barry2015" /&gt;

==Biography==
Eugene Franklin Mallove was born on June 9, 1947 to Gladys (nee' Alexander)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/norwichbulletin/obituary.aspx?pid=149622538]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mitchell Mallove. He grew up in Norwich, Connecticut and graduated from the Norwich Free Academy in 1965. From an early age, he showed great interest in science and especially astronomy.  While in Boston, he met Joanne Smith, who was a student at Boston University.  On September 9, 1970, Gene and Joanne married. They had two children, Kimberlyn, born in 1974, and Ethan, born in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infinite-energy.com/genemallovecollection/biography.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugene Mallove held a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] (1969) and [[Master of Science|MS]] degree (1970) in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and a [[Doctor of Science|ScD]] degree (1975) in environmental health sciences from [[Harvard University]].  He had worked for technology engineering firms such as [[Hughes Research Laboratories]], the Analytic Science Corporation, and MIT's [[Lincoln Laboratory]], and he consulted in [[research and development]] of new energies.

In 1981, he and Gregory Matloff wrote a classic paper about using [[solar sail]]s to reach [[Alpha Centauri]], the nearest star to our sun. They calculated that the trip would take several hundred years and that the ship would have to withstand accelerations of 60 [[g-force|g]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilster, 2004, p. 124; Matloff, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matloff, 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tIfJM8Nu8iYC&amp;pg=PA52 52]&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote several papers on that and other proposed methods of space travel, such as [[laser propulsion]], the [[Bussard ramjet]],&lt;ref&gt;Matloff, 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tIfJM8Nu8iYC&amp;pg=PA117 117]&lt;/ref&gt; and  exotic fuels that could give very high power.&lt;ref&gt;Matloff, 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tIfJM8Nu8iYC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;vq=mallove&amp;dq=mallove 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand section|1=details of the MIT dispute|date=August 2012}}
Mallove taught science journalism at [[MIT]] and [[Boston University]] and was chief science writer at MIT's news office, a position he left as part of a dispute with the school over cold fusion.

He was a science writer and broadcaster with the [[Voice of America]] radio service and author of three science books:  ''The Quickening Universe: Cosmic Evolution and Human Destiny'' (1987, St. Martin’s Press), ''The Starflight Handbook: A Pioneer’s Guide to Interstellar Travel'' (1989, John Wiley &amp; Sons, with co-author Gregory Matloff), and ''Fire from Ice: Searching for the Truth Behind the Cold Fusion Furor'' (1991, John Wiley &amp; Sons).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Book review of Fire from Ice |journal= [[Journal of Scientific Exploration]] |volume= 6 |issue= 1 |pages= 81–84 |year= 1992 |url= http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/reviews/reviews_06_1_bauer.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100706165548/http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/reviews/reviews_06_1_bauer.pdf |archivedate= 2010-07-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also published articles for numerous magazines and newspapers.

Mallove was a member of the Aurora Biophysics Research Institute (ABRI), one of the founders of the International Society of the Friends of Aetherometry, a member of its Organizing Committee, a co-inventor of the HYBORAC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetherenergy.com/Letters/mallove_letter2.php Report by Mallove] on HYBORAC and other similar technologies.&lt;/ref&gt; technology and one of the main evaluators of ABRI&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abrisci.com/ ABRI] organizational website.&lt;/ref&gt; technologies.

His alternative energy research included studying the reproduction of [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s [[Orgone]] Motor by Dr. Paulo Correa and Alexandra Correa, as well as the evolution of heat in the [[Wilhelm Reich#Experiment with Einstein|Reich-Einstein experiment]].  He was among the scientists and engineers who claimed to have confirmed the output of excess electric energy from tuned pulsed plasmas in vacuum arc discharges.

Mallove's combative stance against what he saw as the hypocrisy of mainstream science gave him a high-profile. Among other things, he was a frequent guest on the American radio program ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]''.

In 1992, Mallove was a consultant on the ERR (Electromagnetic Radiation Receiver) project at the Noah’s Ark Research Facility in the Philippines. He is also credited as a "cold fusion technical consultant", for providing advice to the producers of the movie ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]'' from 1997, with a plot revolving around cold fusion formulas.

Eugene Mallove was a notable proponent and supporter of research into cold fusion. He authored the book ''Fire from Ice'', which details the 1989 report of table-top cold fusion from [[Stanley Pons]] and [[Martin Fleischmann]] at the [[University of Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;Fleischmann, M., S. Pons, and M. Hawkins, Electrochemically induced nuclear fusion of deuterium. J. Electroanal. Chem., 1989. 261: p. 301 and errata in Vol. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; The book claims the team did produce "greater-than-unity" output energy in an experiment that was successfully replicated on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Mallove, E. J. (1999). ''Fire from Ice: Searching for the Truth Behind the Cold Fusion Furor'', Infinite Energy Press, United States of America, {{ISBN|1-892925-02-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mallove claims that the results were suppressed through an organized campaign of ridicule from mainstream physicists.

==Death==
Eugene Mallove was killed on May 14, 2004 in [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]], [[Connecticut]], while cleaning a recently vacated rental property owned by his parents, the home he grew up in.

On May 22, 2011, a state prosecutor said that they were charging a third person in connection with the killing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5534">The '''fermion doubling problem''' is a problem that is encountered when naively trying to put [[fermionic field]]s on a [[lattice field theory|lattice]]. It consists in the appearance of spurious states, such that one ends up having 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; fermionic particles (with ''d'' the number of discretized dimensions) for each original fermion. In order to solve this problem, several strategies are in use, such as [[Wilson fermion]]s and [[staggered fermion]]s.

==Mathematical overview==
The action of a [[free field|free]] [[Dirac fermion]] in ''d'' dimensions,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As the lattice discretization is always defined in Euclidean spacetime, we will suppose the suitable [[Wick rotation]] has been performed. Herefore, no difference will be made between covariant and cotravariant indices.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[mass]] ''m'', and in the continuum (i.e. without discretization) is commonly given as
:&lt;math&gt; S = \int d^dx \; \bar\psi (\partial\!\!\!/ + m) \psi \;.&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the [[Feynman slash notation]] was used to write
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_\mu a^{\mu} = a\!\!\!/ &lt;/math&gt;
where γ&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[gamma matrices]]. When this action is discretized on a cubic lattice, the fermion field ψ(''x'') is replaced with a discretized version ψ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''x'' now denotes the lattice site. The derivative is replaced by the [[finite difference]]. The resulting action is now:&lt;ref name=wiese&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chandrasekharan | last2 = Wiese | title = An Introduction to chiral symmetry on the lattice | journal = Prog. Part. Nucl. Phys. | volume = 53 | pages = 373 | date = 2004 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146641004000948 | doi = 10.1016/j.ppnp.2004.05.003|arxiv = hep-lat/0405024 |bibcode = 2004PrPNP..53..373C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; S = a^d \sum_{x,\mu} \frac1{2a} (\bar\psi_x\gamma_\mu\psi_{x+\hat\mu} - \bar\psi_{x+\hat\mu}\gamma_\mu\psi_x) + a^d \sum_x m\bar\psi_x\psi_x \;,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' is the lattice spacing and &lt;math&gt;\hat\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of length ''a'' in the μ direction. When one computes the inverse fermion propagator in [[momentum space]], one readily finds:&lt;ref name="wiese" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; S^{-1}(p) = m + \frac ia \sum_\mu \gamma_\mu \sin(p_\mu a) \;. &lt;/math&gt;
Due to the finite lattice spacing the momenta ''p''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; have to be inside the (first) [[Brillouin zone]], which is typically taken to be the interval [−{{Pi}}/''a'',+{{Pi}}/''a''].

When simply taking the limit ''a'' → 0 in the above inverse propagator, one recovers the correct continuum result. However, when instead expanding this expression around a value of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; where one or more of the components are at the corners of the Brillouin zone (i.e. equal to {{Pi}}/''a''), one finds the same continuum form again, although the sign in front of the gamma matrix can change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv | last = Gupta | eprint = hep-lat/9807028 | title = Introduction to lattice QCD | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Due to these changes in sign, the [[chiral anomaly]] cancels exactly, which is not in agreement with phenomenology.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that, when one of the components of the momentum is near {{Pi}}/''a'', the discretized fermion field will again behave like a continuum fermion. This can happen with all ''d'' components of the momentum, leading to —with the original fermion with momentum near the origin included— 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; different "tastes" (in analogy to [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]]).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As the action of scalars contains second derivatives, a similar procedure in this case would lead to a quadratic inverse propagator, which does not have these doublers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Nielsen–Ninomiya theorem==
[[Holger Bech Nielsen|Nielsen]] and Ninomiya proved a theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | last2 = Ninomiya | authorlink1 = Holger Bech Nielsen | title = Absence of Neutrinos on a Lattice | journal = Nucl. Phys. B | volume = 185 | year = 1981 | pages = 20 | doi = 10.1016/0550-3213(81)90361-8|bibcode = 1981NuPhB.185...20N }}&lt;br/&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | last2 = Ninomiya | authorlink1 = Holger Bech Nielsen | title = No go theorem for regularizing chiral fermions | journal = Phys.

The only way to get rid of the doublers is by violating one of the presuppositions of the theorem —for example:
* [[Wilson fermion]]s explicitly violate chiral symmetry, giving an infinitely high mass to the doublers which then decouple.
* So-called "[[perfect fermions|perfect lattice fermions]]" have a nonlocal action.
* [[Staggered fermion]]s
* [[Twisted mass fermions]]
* [[Ginsparg–Wilson fermions]]
* [[Domain wall fermions]]
* [[Overlap fermions]]

Specifically, they include [[Aldehyde|aldehydes]], [[Ester|esters]], and [[Alcohol|alcohols]] of 6-carbon compounds released after wounding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-11101536|title=Plants send SOS signal to insects|last=Gill|first=Victoria|date=2010-08-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds are very quickly produced and emitted, and are used by nearly every green plant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Plants constantly release GLVs, but un-stressed plants release them in much smaller amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Li|first=Tao|title=Neighbour Recognition Through Volatile-Mediated Interactions|date=2016|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-33498-1_7|work=Signaling and Communication in Plants|pages=153–174|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-33498-1_7|isbn=9783319334967|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these chemicals act as [[Signaling (telecommunications)|signaling]] compounds between either plants of the same species, of other species, or even vastly different lifeforms like insects. Some, although not necessarily all, of these chemicals act essentially as plant [[pheromones]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Green leaf volatiles#cite note-2|[12]]]&lt;/sup&gt; GLVs also have antimicrobial properties to prevent infection at the site of injury.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Uses ==
GLVs are used in both plant-plant and plant-insect interactions. They usually serve as a warning signal of oncoming causes of tissue damage. When a plant is attacked, it emits GLVs into the environment through the air&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scala|first=Alessandra|last2=Allmann|first2=Silke|last3=Mirabella|first3=Rossana|last4=Haring|first4=Michel A.|last5=Schuurink|first5=Robert C.|date=2013-08-30|title=Green Leaf Volatiles: A Plant’s Multifunctional Weapon against Herbivores and Pathogens|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3794753/|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=14|issue=9|pages=17781–17811|doi=10.3390/ijms140917781|issn=1422-0067|pmc=3794753|pmid=23999587}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Undamaged neighboring plants perceive these GLV signals and activate the expression of genes related to the plants defense mechanisms&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. This allows the plant emitting the GLVs and the neighboring plants to enter a primed state. In this primed state plants activate their defenses systems more quickly and in a stronger concentration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ul Hassan|first=Muhammad Naeem|last2=Zainal|first2=Zamri|last3=Ismail|first3=Ismanizan|date=August 2015|title=Green leaf volatiles: biosynthesis, biological functions and their applications in biotechnology|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25865366|journal=Plant Biotechnology Journal|volume=13|issue=6|pages=727–739|doi=10.1111/pbi.12368|issn=1467-7652|pmid=25865366}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The amount of GLVs that a wounded plant emits is directly related to the severity of the injury, so the concentration of GLVs in the atmosphere and the frequency of exposure both play a role in neighboring plants successfully entering a primed state&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

In plant-insect interactions, GLVs are used as a form of defense. They alert [[predators]] to the locations of [[Herbivore|herbivores]] that are preying on the plant and causing tissue damage. For example, a study done by Northwestern University found that [[Parasitoid wasp|parasitic wasps]] are more attracted to plants that are emitting GLVs due to wounding from herbivores than to plants that are emitting GLVs due to mechanical damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/research-projects/i/17/8517.html|title=How isomerisation of green leaf volatiles affects plant-insect interactions|last=sitewriter|website=www.nwo.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to determine if plants are capable of recognizing and distinguishing between GLVs, a study was done at University of California Davis where researchers exposed plants to GLVs emitted by a mechanically damaged tomato plant, and to GLVs emitted by a tomato plant that had been damaged by herbivores.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsui|first=Kenji|last2=Sugimoto|first2=Kohichi|last3=Mano|first3=Jun'ichi|last4=Ozawa|first4=Rika|last5=Takabayashi|first5=Junji|date=2012-04-30|title=Differential Metabolisms of Green Leaf Volatiles in Injured and Intact Parts of a Wounded Leaf Meet Distinct Ecophysiological Requirements|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036433|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=e36433|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0036433|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3340338|pmid=22558466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers observed a difference in the plants reaction, showing an increase in the proteins related to defense mechanisms for the plant exposed to the herbivore GLVs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This supports the theory that plants are able to distinguish between different GLVs, and react differently depending on which signal they receive.

== Antimicrobial Properties ==
Other benefits of Green Leaf Volatiles are that at the site of damage, GLVs are released in high concentrations and act as [[antimicrobial]] agents to make the plant more resistant to bacterial or fungal [[Infection|infections]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brilli|first=Federico|last2=Ruuskanen|first2=Taina M.|last3=Schnitzhofer|first3=Ralf|last4=Müller|first4=Markus|last5=Breitenlechner|first5=Martin|last6=Bittner|first6=Vinzenz|last7=Wohlfahrt|first7=Georg|last8=Loreto|first8=Francesco|last9=Hansel|first9=Armin|date=2011-05-26|title=Detection of Plant Volatiles after Leaf Wounding and Darkening by

To study the anti-fungal properties of GLVs, researchers at the University of Arizona influenced how plants expressed HPL, the main [[enzyme]] of GLV synthesis&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ul Hassan|first=Muhammad Naeem|last2=Zainal|first2=Zamri|last3=Ismail|first3=Ismanizan|date=2015-04-10|title=Green leaf volatiles: biosynthesis, biological functions and their applications in biotechnology|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pbi.12368|journal=Plant Biotechnology Journal|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=727–739|doi=10.1111/pbi.12368|issn=1467-7644}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Scientists compared the rates of fungal spore growth in HPL over-expressing and HPL silencing mutants to the wild type plants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Results from the study showed lower rates of fungal growth and higher GLV emissions on the HPL over-expressing mutants, while the HPL silencing mutants showed higher rates of fungal growth and lower GLV emissions, which supports the hypothesis that GLVs have antimicrobial properties.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The antimicrobial properties of GLVs have also been part of an [[evolutionary arms race]] that raise questions for scientists. During an infection, plants emit GLVs to act as microbial agents, but bacteria and viruses have adapted to use these GLVs to their own benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-08-01|title=Crosstalk between abiotic and biotic stress responses: a current view from the points of convergence in the stress signaling networks|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526606000884|journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=436–442|doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2006.05.014|issn=1369-5266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common example of this is found in the red raspberry. When the red raspberry plant is infected, the virus influences it to produce more GLVs, which attract the red raspberry aphid.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engelberth|first=Juergen|last2=Alborn|first2=Hans T.|last3=Schmelz|first3=Eric A.|last4=Tumlinson|first4=James H.|date=2004-02-10|title=Airborne signals prime plants against insect herbivore attack|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/6/1781|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=101|issue=6|pages=1781–1785|doi=10.1073/pnas.0308037100|issn=0027-8424|pmid=14749516}}&lt;/ref&gt; These GLVs cause more aphids to come and to feed on the plant for longer, giving the virus better chances of being ingested and spread more widely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Researchers are now trying to determine whether under infectious conditions plants emit GLVs for their benefit, or if bacteria and viruses induce the release of these compounds for their own benefit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dombrowski|first=James E.|last2=Martin|first2=Ruth C.|date=2018-01-29|title=Activation of MAP kinases by green leaf volatiles in grasses|url=https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-017-3076-9|journal=BMC Research Notes|language=En|volume=11|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s13104-017-3076-9|issn=1756-0500|pmc=5789745|pmid=29378628}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

She founded and is the chief executive of [[Good Energy]], a leading [[renewable energy]] company in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Origins and education==
Davenport was born in [[Haslemere]], Surrey, in 1968.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;Tim Webb, [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/naturalresources/article3625729.ece ''The Good Life still means Sustainability''], The Times, 10 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;Emma Sinclair, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/9799277/How-Juliet-Davenport-went-from-scientist-to-chief-executive.html ''How Juliet Davenport went from science to chief executive''], Daily Telegraph, 14 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

She read physics as an undergraduate at [[Merton College, Oxford]] before taking a master's degree in economics and environmental economics at [[Birkbeck, University of London]]. She also worked for a year at the [[European Commission]] on European energy policy and at the [[European Parliament]] on carbon taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tran, [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/jun/25/ethicalbusiness.economicdispatch ''Ethical powerhouse''], The Guardian, 25 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Davenport began working with Energy for Sustainable Development, an environmental consultancy.

The '''Kawęczyn Heat Plant''' is a coal-fired heat plant at [[osiedle]] Kawęczyn in [[Rembertów]] district of [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. It was operated by [[Vattenfall]] but their Polish operations were taken over by Polish energy company [[PGNiG]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://termika.pgnig.pl/about-pgnig-termika/our-plants/ | title = Our Plants | accessdate = 2014-02-18 | author = PGNiG Termika | work = PGNiG Termika | language = Polish | quote = PGNiG TERMIKA owns five plants: HP Kawęczyn, CHP Pruszków, CHP Siekierki, CHP Żerań and HP Wola. They produce approximately 401 million GJ of heat which covers 70% of the demand in Warsaw and 60% in Pruszków, Piastów and Michałowice. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222181945/http://termika.pgnig.pl/about-pgnig-termika/our-plants/ | archivedate = 2014-02-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31922">[[File:Conventional-lathe.jpg|thumb|A [[metal lathe]] is an example of a machine tool]]
A '''machine tool''' is a [[machine]] for shaping or [[machining]] metal or other rigid materials, usually by cutting, boring, [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], shearing, or other forms of deformation.  Machine tools employ some sort of tool that does the cutting or shaping.  All machine tools have some means of constraining the workpiece and provide a guided movement of the parts of the machine.   Thus the relative movement between the workpiece and the [[cutting tool]] (which is called the '''toolpath''') is controlled or constrained by the machine to at least some extent, rather than being entirely "offhand" or "[[wikt:freehand#Adjective|freehand]]".

The precise definition of the term ''machine tool'' varies among users, as discussed [[#Nomenclature and key concepts, interrelated|below]]. While all machine tools are "machines that help people to make things", not all factory machines are machine tools.

Today machine tools are typically powered other than by human muscle (e.g., electrically, hydraulically, or via [[line shaft]]), used to make manufactured parts (components) in various ways that include cutting or certain other kinds of deformation.

With their inherent precision, machine tools enabled the economical production of [[interchangeable parts]].

==Nomenclature and key concepts, interrelated==
Many [[history of technology|historians of technology]] consider that true machine tools were born when the toolpath first became guided by the machine itself in some way, at least to some extent, so that direct, [[wikt:freehand#Adjective|freehand]] human guidance of the toolpath (with hands, feet, or mouth) was no longer the only guidance used in the cutting or forming process. In this view of the definition, the term, arising at a time when all tools up till then had been [[hand tool]]s, simply provided a label for "tools that were machines instead of hand tools". Early lathes, those prior to the late [[medieval]] period, and modern woodworking lathes and [[potter's wheel]]s may or may not fall under this definition, depending on how one views the headstock [[spindle (tool)|spindle]] itself; but the earliest historical records of a lathe with direct mechanical control ''of the cutting tool's path'' are of a screw-cutting lathe dating to about 1483.&lt;ref name="Moore1970p137"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1970|p=137, figure 213}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This lathe "produced screw threads out of wood and employed a true compound slide rest".

The mechanical toolpath guidance grew out of various root concepts:

* First is the [[spindle (tool)|spindle]] concept itself, which constrains workpiece or tool movement to [[rotation around a fixed axis]]. This ancient concept predates machine tools per se; the earliest lathes and [[potter's wheel]]s incorporated it for the workpiece, but the movement of the tool itself on these machines was entirely freehand.
* The machine slide, which has many forms, such as dovetail ways, box ways, or cylindrical column ways. Machine slides constrain tool or workpiece movement [[wikt:linear#Adjective|linearly]]. If a stop is added, the ''length'' of the line can also be accurately controlled. (Machine slides are essentially a subset of [[linear bearing]]s, although the language used to classify these various [[machine element]]s includes [[connotation|connotative]] boundaries; some users in some contexts would contradistinguish elements in ways that others might not.)
* Tracing, which involves following the contours of a model or template and transferring the resulting motion to the toolpath.
* [[Cam]] operation, which is related in principle to tracing but can be a step or two removed from the traced element's matching the reproduced element's final shape. For example, several cams, no one of which directly matches the desired output shape, can actuate a complex toolpath by creating component [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] that add up to a net toolpath.
* [[Van_der_Waals_force|Van Der Waals Force]] between like metals is high; freehand manufacture as described below in History of square plates produces only square, flat, machine tool components, accurate to millionths of an inch, but of nearly no variety. The process of feature replication allows the flatness and squareness of a milling machine or the roundness, lack of taper, and squareness of the two axes of a lathe machine to be transferred to a machined work piece with accuracy and precision better than a thousandth of an inch, not as fine as millionths of an inch. As the fit between sliding parts of a made product, machine, or machine tool approaches this critical thousandth of an inch measurement, lubrication and capillary action combine to prevent Van Der Walls force from welding like metals together, extending the lubricated life of sliding parts by a factor of thousands to millions; the disaster of oil depletion in the conventional automotive engine is an accessible demonstration of the need, and in aerospace design, like-to-unlike design is used along with solid lubricants to prevent Van Der Walls welding from destroying mating surfaces.

Abstractly programmable toolpath guidance began with mechanical solutions, such as in [[musical box]] cams and [[Jacquard loom]]s. The [[technological convergence|convergence]] of programmable mechanical control with machine tool toolpath control was delayed many decades, in part because the programmable control methods of musical boxes and looms lacked the rigidity for machine tool toolpaths. Later, electromechanical solutions (such as [[servomechanism|servos]]) and soon electronic solutions (including [[computer]]s) were added, leading to [[numerical control|numerical control and computer numerical control]].

When considering the difference between freehand toolpaths and machine-constrained toolpaths, the concepts of [[accuracy and precision]], [[efficiency]], and [[productivity]] become important in understanding ''why'' the machine-constrained option adds [[value (economics)|value]]. 

Matter-Additive, Matter-Preserving, and Matter-Subtractive "Manufacturing" can proceed in 16 ways: The work may be held in a hand or a clamp; the tool may be held in a hand (the other hand) or a clamp; the power can come from the hand(s) holding the tool and/or the work, or from some external source, including a foot treadle by the same worker, or a motor without limitation; and the control can come from the hand(s) holding the tool and/or the work, or from some other source, including computer numerical control. With two choices for each of four parameters, the types are enumerated to sixteen types of Manufacturing, where Matter-Additive might mean painting on canvas as readily as it might mean 3D printing under computer control, Matter-Preserving might mean forging at the coal fire as readily as stamping license plates, and Matter-Subtracting might mean casually whittling a pencil point as readily as it might mean precision grinding the final form of a laser deposited turbine blade.

Humans are generally quite talented in their freehand movements; the drawings, paintings, and [[sculpture]]s of artists such as [[Michelangelo]] or [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and of countless other talented people, show that human freehand toolpath has great potential. The [[value (economics)|value]] that machine tools added to these human talents is in the areas of rigidity (constraining the toolpath despite thousands of [[newton (unit)|newtons]] ([[pound-force|pounds]]) of force fighting against the constraint), [[accuracy and precision]], [[efficiency]], and [[productivity]]. With a machine tool, toolpaths that no human muscle could constrain can be constrained; and toolpaths that are technically possible with freehand methods, but would require tremendous time and skill to execute, can instead be executed quickly and easily, even by people with little freehand talent (because the machine takes care of it). The latter aspect of machine tools is often referred to by historians of technology as "building the skill into the tool", in contrast to the toolpath-constraining skill being in the ''person'' who wields the tool. As an example, it is ''physically possible'' to make [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] screws, bolts, and nuts entirely with freehand toolpaths. But it is ''economically practical'' to make them only with machine tools.

In the 1930s, the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) referenced the definition of a machine tool as "any machine operating by other than hand power which employs a tool to work on metal".&lt;ref name="Jerome1934"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jerome|1934|p=178, Ch. 4, Note 75}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrowest [[colloquial]] sense of the term reserves it only for machines that perform metal cutting—in other words, the many kinds of [conventional] [[machining]] and [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]]. These processes are a type of deformation that produces [[swarf]]. However, [[economist]]s use a slightly broader sense that also includes metal deformation of other types that squeeze the metal into shape without cutting off swarf, such as rolling, stamping with [[die (manufacturing)|dies]], shearing, [[swaging]], [[rivet]]ing, and others. Thus [[machine press|presses]] are usually included in the economic definition of machine tools. For example, this is the breadth of definition used by [[Max Holland]] in his history of Burgmaster and Houdaille,&lt;ref name="Holland1989"&gt;{{Harvnb|Holland|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also a history of the machine tool industry in general from the 1940s through the 1980s; he was reflecting the sense of the term used by Houdaille itself and other firms in the industry. Many reports on machine tool [[export]] and [[import]] and similar economic topics use this broader definition.

The colloquial sense implying [conventional] metal cutting is also growing obsolete because of changing technology over the decades. The many more recently developed processes labeled "machining", such as [[electrical discharge machining]], [[electrochemical machining]], [[electron beam machining]], [[photochemical machining]], and [[ultrasonic machining]], or even [[plasma cutting]] and [[water jet cutter|water jet cutting]], are often performed by machines that could most logically be called machine tools. In addition, some of the newly developed [[additive manufacturing]] processes, which are not about cutting away material but rather about adding it, are done by machines that are likely to end up labeled, in some cases, as machine tools. In fact, [[machine tool builder]]s are already developing machines that include both [[subtractive manufacturing|subtractive]] and [[additive manufacturing]] in one work envelope,&lt;ref name="Zelinski_2013-11-08"&gt;{{Citation |last=Zelinski |first=Peter |date=2013-11-08 |title=Hybrid machine combines milling and additive manufacturing |journal=[[Modern Machine Shop]] |url=http://www.mmsonline.com/blog/post/hybrid-machine-combines-milling-and-additive-manufacturing |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and retrofits of existing machines are underway.&lt;ref name="Zelinski_2014-02-21"&gt;{{Citation |last=Zelinski |first=Peter |date=2014-02-21 |title=The capacity to build 3D metal forms is a retrofittable option for subtractive CNC machine tools |journal=[[Modern Machine Shop]] Additive Manufacturing supplement |url=http://www.additivemanufacturinginsight.com/articles/add-on-additive-manufacturing |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[natural language]] use of the terms varies, with subtle [[connotation|connotative]] boundaries. Many speakers resist using the term "machine tool" to refer to [[woodworking machine]]ry (joiners, table saws, routing stations, and so on), but it is difficult to maintain any true logical dividing line, and therefore many speakers accept a broad definition. It is common to hear machinists refer to their machine tools simply as "machines". Usually the [[mass noun]] "machinery" encompasses them, but sometimes it is used to imply only those machines that are being excluded from the definition of "machine tool". This is why the machines in a food-processing plant, such as conveyors, mixers, vessels, dividers, and so on, may be labeled "machinery", while the machines in the factory's tool and die department are instead called "machine tools" in contradistinction. As for the 1930s NBER definition quoted above, one could argue that its specificity to metal is obsolete, as it is quite common today for particular lathes, milling machines, and machining centers (definitely machine tools) to work exclusively on plastic cutting jobs throughout their whole working lifespan. Thus the NBER definition above could be expanded to say "which employs a tool to work on metal ''or other materials of high hardness''". And its specificity to "operating by other than hand power" is also problematic, as machine tools can be powered by people if appropriately set up, such as with a [[treadle]] (for a [[lathe]]) or a hand lever (for a [[shaper]]). Hand-powered shapers are clearly "the 'same thing' as shapers with electric motors except smaller", and it is trivial to power a [[micro lathe]] with a hand-cranked belt pulley instead of an electric motor. Thus one can question whether power source is truly a key distinguishing concept; but for economics purposes, the NBER's definition made sense, because most of the commercial value of the existence of machine tools comes about via those that are powered by electricity, hydraulics, and so on. Such are the vagaries of [[natural language]] and [[controlled vocabulary]], both of which have their places in the business world.

== History ==
Forerunners of machine tools included bow drills and potter's wheels, which had existed in ancient Egypt prior to 2500 BC, and lathes, known to have existed in multiple regions of Europe since at least 1000 to 500 BC.&lt;ref name="Woodbury_1972_1961_pp18-35"&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|pp=18–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not until the later [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]] that the modern concept of a machine tool—a class of machines used as tools in the making of metal parts, and incorporating machine-guided toolpath—began to evolve. [[Clockmaker]]s of the Middle Ages and [[polymath|renaissance men]] such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] helped expand humans' technological milieu toward the preconditions for industrial machine tools. During the 18th and 19th centuries, and even in many cases in the 20th, the builders of machine tools tended to be the same people who would then use them to produce the end products (manufactured goods). However, from these roots also evolved an industry of machine tool builders as we define them today, meaning people who specialize in building machine tools for sale to others.

Historians of machine tools often focus on a handful of major industries that most spurred machine tool development. In order of historical emergence, they have been [[firearm]]s (small arms and [[artillery]]); [[horology|clocks]]; textile machinery; steam engines ([[stationary steam engine|stationary]], [[marine steam engine|marine]], [[locomotive|rail]], and [[history of steam road vehicles|otherwise]]) (the story of how [[James Watt|Watt]]'s need for an accurate cylinder spurred Boulton's boring machine is discussed by [[Joseph Wickham Roe|Roe]]&lt;ref name="Roe1916"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;); [[sewing machine]]s; [[bicycle]]s; [[automobile]]s; and [[aircraft]]. Others could be included in this list as well, but they tend to be connected with the root causes already listed. For example, [[rolling-element bearing]]s are an industry of themselves, but this industry's main drivers of development were the vehicles already listed—trains, bicycles, automobiles, and aircraft; and other industries, such as tractors, farm implements, and tanks, borrowed heavily from those same parent industries.

Machine tools filled a need created by textile machinery during the [[Industrial Revolution]] in England in the middle to late 1700s.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;  Until that time machinery was made mostly from wood, often including gearing and shafts.  The increase in [[mechanization]] required more metal parts, which were usually made of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]].  Cast iron could be cast in molds for larger parts, such as engine cylinders and gears, but was difficult to work with a file and could not be hammered.  Red hot wrought iron could be hammered into shapes.  Room temperature wrought iron was worked with a file and chisel and could be made into gears and other complex parts; however, hand working lacked precision and was a slow and expensive process.

[[James Watt]] was unable to have an accurately bored cylinder for his first steam engine, trying for several years until [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented a suitable boring machine in 1774, boring Boulton &amp; Watt's first commercial engine in 1776.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

The advance in the accuracy of machine tools can be traced to Henry Maudslay and refined by Joseph Whitworth. That Maudslay had established the manufacture and use of master plane gages in his shop (Maudslay &amp; Field) located on Westminster Road south of the Thames River in London about 1809, was attested to by James Nasmyth who was employed by Maudslay in 1829 and Nasmyth documented their use in his autobiography.

The process by which the master plane gages were produced dates back to antiquity but was refined to an unprecedented degree in the Maudslay shop. The process begins with three square plates each given an identification (ex., 1,2 and 3). The first step is to rub plates 1 and 2 together with a marking medium (called bluing today) revealing the high spots which would be removed by hand scraping with a steel scraper, until no irregularities were visible. This would not produce true plane surfaces but a "ball and socket" concave-concave and convex-convex fit, as this mechanical fit, like two perfect planes, can slide over each other and reveal no high spots. The rubbing and marking are repeated after rotating 2 relative to 1 by 90 degrees to eliminate concave-convex "potato-chip" curvature. Next, plate number 3 is compared and scraped to conform to plate number 1 in the same two trials. In this manner plates number 2 and 3 would be identical. Next plates number 2 and 3 would be checked against each other to determine what condition existed, either both plates were "balls" or "sockets" or "chips" or a combination. These would then be scraped until no high spots existed and then compared to plate number 1. Repeating this process of comparing and scraping the three plates could produce plane surfaces accurate to within millionths of an inch (the thickness of the marking medium).

The traditional method of producing the surface gages used an abrasive powder rubbed between the plates to remove the high spots, but it was Whitworth who contributed the refinement of replacing the grinding with hand scraping. Sometime after 1825 Whitworth went to work for Maudslay and it was there that Whitworth perfected the hand scraping of master surface plane gages. In his paper presented to the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Glasgow in 1840, Whitworth pointed out the inherent inaccuracy of grinding due to no control and thus unequal distribution of the abrasive material between the plates which would produce uneven removal of material from the plates.

With the creation of master plane gages of such high accuracy, all critical components of machine tools (i.e., guiding surfaces such as machine ways) could then be compared against them and scraped to the desired accuracy.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;
The first machine tools offered for sale (i.e., commercially available) were constructed by [[Matthew Murray]] in England around 1800.&lt;ref name="Moore1970"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1970}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Henry Maudslay]], [[James Nasmyth]], and [[Joseph Whitworth]], soon followed the path of expanding their entrepreneurship from manufactured end products and [[millwright]] work into the realm of building machine tools for sale.

Important early machine tools included the slide rest lathe, [[screw-cutting lathe]], [[turret lathe]], [[milling machine]], pattern tracing lathe, [[shaper]], and [[planer (metalworking)|metal planer]], which were all in use before 1840.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;  With these machine tools the decades-old objective of producing [[interchangeable parts]] was finally realized.  An important early example of something now taken for granted was the standardization of screw fasteners such as nuts and bolts.  Before about the beginning of the 19th century, these were used in pairs, and even screws of the same machine were generally not interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Rybczynsky, ''One Good Turn'', 2000, {{ISBN|0-684-86729-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Methods were developed to cut screw thread to a greater precision than that of the feed screw in the lathe being used.  This led to the bar [[Meter|length standard]]s of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

American production of machine tools was a critical factor in the Allies' victory in World War II.  Production of machine tools tripled in the United States in the war.  No war was more industrialized than World War II, and it has been written that the war was won as much by [[machine shop]]s as by machine guns.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur. ''Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II,'' pp. 87, 112, 121, 146-50, 161, Random House, New York, NY. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-6964-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Dana T.

The production of machine tools is concentrated in about 10 countries worldwide: China, Japan, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, USA, Austria, Spain and a few others. Machine tool innovation continues in several public and private research centers worldwide.

==Drive power sources==
&lt;blockquote&gt;“all the turning of the iron for the cotton machinery built by [[Samuel Slater|Mr. Slater]] was done with hand chisels or tools in lathes turned by cranks with hand power”.  [[David Wilkinson (machinist)|David Wilkinson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomson|2009|pp=24|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Machine tools can be powered from a variety of sources.  Human and animal power (via [[crank (mechanism)|crank]]s, [[treadle]]s, [[treadmill]]s, or [[treadwheel]]s) were used in the past, as was water power (via [[water wheel]]); however, following the development of high-pressure steam engines in the mid 19th century, factories increasingly used steam power.  Factories also used hydraulic and pneumatic power.  Many small workshops continued to use water, human and animal power until [[electrification]] after 1900.&lt;ref name = "Hunter&amp;Bryant 1991"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Today most machine tools are powered by electricity; however, hydraulic and pneumatic power are sometimes used, but this is uncommon.

==Automatic control==
{{see also|History of numerical control}}
Machine tools can be operated manually, or under automatic control.  Early machines used [[flywheel]]s to stabilize their motion and had complex systems of gears and levers to control the machine and the piece being worked on.  Soon after World War II, the [[numerical control]] (NC) machine was developed. NC machines used a series of numbers punched on [[paper tape]] or [[punched card]]s to control their motion.  In the 1960s, [[computers]] were added to give even more flexibility to the process. Such machines became known as [[computerized numerical control (CNC) machines]].  NC and CNC machines could precisely repeat sequences over and over, and could produce much more complex pieces than even the most skilled tool operators.

Before long, the machines could automatically change the specific cutting and shaping tools that were being used.  For example, a [[drill]] machine might contain a magazine with a variety of [[drill bit]]s for producing holes of various sizes.  Previously, either machine operators would usually have to manually change the bit or move the work piece to another station to perform these different operations. The next logical step was to combine several different machine tools together, all under computer control.  These are known as [[machining center]]s, and have dramatically changed the way parts are made.

== Examples ==
Examples of machine tools are:

* [[Broach (metalwork)|Broaching machine]]
* [[Drill#Drill press|Drill press]]
* [[Gear shaper]]
* [[Hobbing machine]]
* [[Hone]]
* [[Lathe (tool)|Lathe]]
* [[Screw machine (automatic lathe)|Screw machine]]s
* [[Milling machine]]
* [[Shear (sheet metal)]]
* [[Shaper]]
* [[Saws]]
* [[Planer (metalworking)|Planer]]
* [[Stewart platform]] mills
* [[Grinding machine]]s
* Multitasking machines (MTMs)—CNC machine tools with many axes that combine turning, milling, grinding, and material handling into one highly automated machine tool

When fabricating or shaping parts, several techniques are used to remove unwanted metal.  Among these are:

* [[Electrical discharge machining]]
* [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)]]
* [[cutting tool (metalworking)|Multiple edge cutting tools]]
* Single edge cutting tools

Other techniques are used to ''add'' desired material. Devices that fabricate components by selective ''addition'' of material are called [[rapid prototyping]] machines.

== Machine tool manufacturing industry ==

The worldwide market for machine tools was approximately $81 billion in production in 2014 according to a survey by market research firm Gardner Research.&lt;ref name="gardner"&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 World Machine-Tool Output and Consumption Survey|url=https://www.gardnerweb.com/cdn/cms/GR-2015-WMTS.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921224058/https://www.gardnerweb.com/cdn/cms/GR-2015-WMTS.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-21|website=Gardner Business Media, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest producer of machine tools was China with $23.8 billion of production followed by Germany and Japan at neck and neck with $12.9 billion and $12.88 billion respectively.&lt;ref name="gardner"/&gt; South Korea and Italy rounded out the top 5 producers with revenue of $5.6 billion and $5 billion respectively.&lt;ref name="gardner"/&gt;

The '''Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord''' (Midwestern Accord) is a regional agreement by six governors of states in the [[Midwestern United States|US Midwest]] who are members of the [[Midwestern Governors Association]] (MGA), and the premier of one Canadian province, whose purpose is to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions to combat [[climate change]].  The accord has been inactive since March 2010, when an advisory group presented a plan for action to the association with a scheduled implementation date of January 2012. Signatories to the accord are the US states of [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Illinois]],  [[Iowa]], [[Michigan]], [[Kansas]],  and the Canadian Province of [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref name="hometownsource_com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hometownsource.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3098&amp;Itemid=29|title=10 Midwestern leaders sign greenhouse gas reduction accord|date=2007-11-15|publisher=hometownsource.com|accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers of the accord are [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], and [[South Dakota]], as well as the Canadian Province of [[Ontario]].

While the Midwest has intensive manufacturing and agriculture sectors, making it the most coal-dependent region in North America, it also has significant renewable energy resources and is particularly vulnerable to the climate change caused by burning coal and other fossil fuels. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burning Coal, Burning Cash: Ranking the States that Import the Most Coal — 2014 Update|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/smart-energy-solutions/decrease-coal/burning-coal-burning-cash-2014-update-state-coal-imports.html|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Midwest Regional Impacts|url=http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/highlights/regions/midwest|website=2014 National Climate Assessment|publisher=U.S. Global Change Research Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Midwestern Accord was the fourth tier of the MGA Energy Security and Climate Stewardship Summit Platform, signed on November 15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midwesterngovernors.org/publications/energyplatform.pdf MGA Energy Security and Climate Stewardship Summit Platform]&lt;/ref&gt; It established the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program,&lt;ref name="hometownsource_com"/&gt; which aimed to:
*  establish greenhouse gas reduction targets and time frames consistent with signing states' targets;
*  develop a market-based and multi-sector cap-and-trade mechanism to help achieve those reduction targets;
*  establish a system to enable tracking, management, and crediting for entities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and
*  develop and implement additional steps as needed to achieve the reduction targets, such as a [[low-carbon fuel standard]]s and regional incentives and funding mechanisms.

Through the Midwestern Accord, the governors agreed to establish a Midwestern greenhouse gas reduction program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their states, as well as a working group to provide recommendations regarding the implementation of the accord. In June 2009, the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord Advisory Group finalized its [http://www.midwesternaccord.org/GHG%20Draft%20Advisory%20Group%20Recommendations.pdf draft recommendations]. In March 2010 the advisory group presented a plan to the MGA that called for implementation beginning in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lehmann|first1=Evan|title=Midwest Regional Carbon Pact Faces Delays and Rising Partisanship|url=https://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/02/19/19climatewire-midwest-regional-carbon-pact-faces-delays-an-40140.html|publisher=Climatewire|date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; No further action was taken, as leadership in several of the states switched positions on climate policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paulson|first1=Ken|title=Midwest cap and trade: Not dead, just sleeping|url=http://www.midwestenergynews.com/2011/03/04/midwest-cap-and-trade-is-it-dead-or-no/|publisher=Midwest Energy News|date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mullard 5-10''' was a [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] for a [[valve amplifier]] designed by the British [[vacuum tube|valve]] company, [[Mullard]] in 1954 at the Mullard Applications Research Laboratory (ARL) in Mitcham Surrey UK, part of the New Road factory complex, to take advantage of their particular products. The circuit was first published in [[Practical Wireless]] magazine.

The amplifier featured five valves and an output of 10 watts - hence '5-10'. Of those valves, one was a [[full-wave rectifier]] (an EZ80 or EZ81), one was a pre-amplifier [[pentode]] [[EF86]] and one a double-triode [[12AX7|ECC83]] as [[phase splitter]]. The power amplification was handled by a pair of [[EL84]] working in [[Electronic amplifier|push-pull]] configuration.

The [[frequency response]] of the circuit was from 40Hz to 20,000Hz with less than 0.2% [[Total harmonic distortion|THD]]. 

In 1959 Mullard published its famous booklet "[[Mullard Circuits for Audio Amplifiers]]" covering a range of amplifier and pre-amplifier circuits using valves developed within the Receiving Valve Development Department at the New Road factory.

The circuit design of the Mullard 5-10, together with the recommended Partridge [[Transformer#Output transformer|output transformers]], was famous for its unique sound reproduction and many variations of this amplifier (including Mullard's own 20-watt version, the Mullard 5-20 using the [[EL34]]) were in widespread use until the end of the valve era; similar designs are still manufactured as expensive equipment for valve audiophiles{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}.

'''Municipal solid waste''' ('''MSW'''), commonly known as '''trash''' or '''garbage''' in the [[American English|United States]] and '''rubbish''' in [[British English|Britain]], is a [[List of waste types|waste type]] consisting of everyday items that are discarded by the public. "Garbage" can also refer specifically to [[food waste]], as in a [[garbage disposal]]; the two are sometimes collected separately.

In the European Union, the semantic definition is 'mixed municipal waste,' given waste code 20 03 01 in the European Waste Catalog. Although the waste may originate from a number of sources that has nothing to do with a municipality, the traditional role of municipalities in collecting and managing these kinds of waste have produced the particular etymology 'municipal.'

==Composition==
The composition of municipal solid waste varies greatly from [[municipality]] to municipality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/09593330.2016.1158322 | volume=37 | title=Characterization of municipal solid waste in high-altitude sub-tropical regions | year=2016 | journal=Environmental Technology | pages=2627–2637 | last1 = Kumar | first1 = Sunil | last2 = Dhar | first2 = Hiya | last3 = Nair | first3 = Vijay V. | last4 = Bhattacharyya | first4 = J. K. | last5 = Vaidya | first5 = A. N. | last6 = Akolkar | first6 = A. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it changes significantly with time. In municipalities which have a well developed waste recycling system, the waste stream mainly consists of intractable wastes such as plastic film and non-recyclable packaging materials. At the start of the 20th century, the majority of domestic waste (53%) in the UK consisted of [[coal ash]] from open fires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciwm.co.uk/web/FILES/About_CIWM/100_yrs_London_and_SE_centre.pdf Centenary history of waste and waste managers in London and south east England- Page 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813042213/http://www.ciwm.co.uk/web/FILES/About_CIWM/100_yrs_London_and_SE_centre.pdf |date=2013-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In developed areas without significant recycling activity it predominantly includes [[Green waste|food wastes, market wastes, yard wastes]], [[plastic container]]s and product packaging materials, and other miscellaneous solid wastes from residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/ Non-hazardous Waste] U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Municipal Solid Waste&lt;/ref&gt; Most definitions of municipal solid waste do not include [[industrial waste]]s, agricultural wastes, [[medical waste]], radioactive waste or [[sewage sludge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/page/mswaste/msw.html Municipal Solid Waste] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120233733/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/page/mswaste/msw.html |date=2010-11-20 }} U.S. Energy Information Administration&lt;/ref&gt; Waste collection is performed by the [[municipality]] within a given area. The term ''residual waste'' relates to waste left from household sources containing materials that have not been separated out or sent for reprocessing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countryside.wales.gov.uk/fe/master.asp?n1=366&amp;n2=213&amp;n3=896 Mechanical Biological Treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070927193038/http://www.countryside.wales.gov.uk/fe/master.asp?n1=366&amp;n2=213&amp;n3=896 |date=2007-09-27 }} Welsh Assembly (2005) Mechanical Biological Treatment, Environment Countryside and Planning Website, Welsh Assembly&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waste]] can be classified in several ways but the following list represents a typical classification:

*[[Biodegradable waste]]: [[food waste|food and kitchen waste]], [[green waste]], [[paper]] (most can be recycled although some difficult to compost plant material may be excluded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/sorting/organics-green-bin/|publisher=Christchurch City Council|title=Organics -Green Bin|access-date=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*[[Recycling|Recyclable]] materials: [[paper]], [[cardboard]], [[glass]], [[bottle]]s, [[jar]]s, [[tin can]]s, [[aluminum can]]s, [[aluminum foil]], [[metal]]s, certain [[plastic]]s, [[fabric]]s, [[clothes]], [[tire]]s, [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], etc.
*[[Chemically inert|Inert]] waste: [[construction and demolition waste]], [[soil|dirt]], [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s, [[debris]]
*Electrical and [[electronic waste]] (WEEE) - [[home appliance|electrical appliance]]s, [[lamp (electrical component)|light bulb]]s, [[washing machine]]s, [[Television|TV]]s, [[computer]]s, screens, [[mobile phone]]s, [[alarm clock]]s, [[watch]]es, etc.
*Composite wastes: waste [[clothing]], Tetra Packs, waste plastics such as toys
*[[Hazardous waste]] including most [[paint]]s, [[chemical]]s, [[tire]]s, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[light bulb]]s, electrical appliances, [[fluorescent lamp]]s, [[aerosol spray|aerosol spray cans]], and [[fertilizer]]s
*[[Toxic waste]] including [[pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, and [[fungicide]]s
*[[Biomedical waste]], expired [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, etc.

== Components of solid waste management ==
[[File:Tri des déchets (cropped).jpg|thumb|Bins to collect [[Paper recycling|paper]], [[Aluminium recycling|aluminium]], [[Glass recycling|glass]], [[PET bottle recycling|PET bottles]] and incinerable waste.]]

The municipal solid waste industry has four components: [[recycling]], [[compost]]ing, [[landfill|disposal]], and [[waste-to-energy]] via incineration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/page/mswaste/msw.html Nonhazardous waste] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120233733/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/page/mswaste/msw.html |date=2010-11-20 }} U.S. Energy Information Administration&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single approach that can be applied to the management of all waste streams, therefore the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], a [[U.S. federal government]] agency, developed a hierarchy ranking strategy for municipal solid waste.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sftool.gov/explore/green-building/section/57/solid-waste/system-overview System Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Waste hierarchy|Waste Management Hierarchy]] is made up of four levels ordered from most preferred to least preferred methods based on their environmental soundness: Source reduction and reuse; recycling or composting; [[energy recovery]]; treatment and disposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/hierarchy.htm Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts and Figures]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collection ===
The functional element of collection includes not only the gathering of solid waste and recyclable materials, but also the transport of these materials, after collection, to the location where the collection vehicle is emptied. This location may be a materials processing facility, a transfer station or a landfill disposal site.

=== Waste handling and separation, storage and processing at the source ===
Waste handling and separation involves activities associated with waste management until the waste is placed in storage containers for collection. Handling also encompasses the movement of loaded containers to the point of collection. Separating different types of waste components is an important step in the handling and storage of solid waste at the source.

=== Segregation and processing and transformation of solid wastes ===
The types of means and facilities that are now used for the recovery of waste materials that have been separated at the source include curbside ('kerbside' in the UK) collection, drop-off and buy-back centers. The separation and processing of wastes that have been separated at the source and the separation of commingled wastes usually occur at a materials recovery facility, transfer stations, combustion facilities and treatment plants.

=== Transfer and transport ===
This element involves two main steps. First, the waste is transferred from a smaller collection vehicle to larger transport equipment. The waste is then transported, usually over long distances, to a processing or disposal site.

=== Disposal ===
[[Image:Mixed municipal waste.JPG|right|thumbnail|200px|Mixed municipal waste, [[Hiriya]], [[Tel Aviv]] ]]
Today, the disposal of wastes by land filling or land spreading is the ultimate fate of all solid wastes, whether they are residential wastes collected and transported directly to a landfill site, residual materials from [[materials recovery facilities]] (MRFs), residue from the combustion of solid waste, [[compost]], or other substances from various solid waste processing facilities. A modern sanitary landfill is not a dump; it is an engineered facility used for disposing of solid wastes on land without creating nuisances or hazards to public health or safety, such as the problems of insects and the contamination of [[ground water]].

=== Reusing ===
In the recent years environmental organizations, such as [[Freegle]] or [[Freecycle Network]], have been gaining popularity for their online reuse networks. These networks provide a worldwide online registry of unwanted items that would otherwise be thrown away, for individuals and nonprofits to reuse or recycle. Therefore, this free Internet-based service reduces landfill pollution and promotes the [[gift economy]].

===Landfills===
[[Landfill]]s are created by land dumping. Land dumping methods vary, most commonly it involves the mass dumping of waste into a designated area, usually a hole or sidehill. After the waste is dumped, it is then compacted by large machines. When the dumping cell is full, it is then "sealed" with a plastic sheet and covered in several feet of dirt. This is the primary method of dumping in the United States because of the low cost and abundance of unused land in North America. Landfills pose the threat of pollution, and can intoxicate ground water. The signs of pollution are effectively masked by disposal companies and it is often hard to see any evidence. Usually landfills are surrounded by large walls or fences hiding the mounds of debris. Large amounts of chemical odor eliminating agent are sprayed in the air surrounding landfills to hide the evidence of the rotting waste inside the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Heather|title=Gone Tomorrow: The Hidden Life of Garbage &lt;!--all that follows appears to be spurious - book was not published by Bedford/St. Martins, is not dated 2015, does not have an ISBN anywhere close to this, looked at book preview and info in article is not included in book at those pages |date=12 March 2015|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|isbn=978-0-312-6784-1|pages=188-190--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy generation ===
Municipal solid waste can be used to generate energy. Several technologies have been developed that make the processing of MSW for energy generation cleaner and more economical than ever before, including landfill gas capture, combustion, [[pyrolysis]], [[gasification]], and [[plasma arc gasification|plasma arc ''gasification'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eesi.org/files/eesi_msw_issuebrief_072109.pdf Environmental and Energy Study Institute Issue Brief]&lt;/ref&gt; While older waste incineration plants emitted a lot of pollutants, recent regulatory changes and new technologies have significantly reduced this concern. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) regulations in 1995 and 2000 under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] have succeeded in reducing emissions of [[dioxins]] from [[waste-to-energy]] facilities by more than 99 percent below 1990 levels, while mercury emissions have been reduced by over 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ncer/publications/research_results_needs/combustionEmmissionsReport.pdf Combustion Emissions from Hazardous Waste Incinerators, Boilers and Industrial Furnaces, and Municipal Solid Waste Incinerators- Results from Five STAR Grants and Research Needs U.S. EPA]&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA noted these improvements in 2003, citing waste-to-energy as a power source "with less environmental impact than almost any other source of [[electricity]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wte.org/userfiles/file/epaletter.pdf U.S. EPA Letter to Maria Zannes, President, Integrated Waste Services Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928085741/http://www.wte.org/userfiles/file/epaletter.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''neutrino''' ({{IPAc-en|n|uː|ˈ|t|r|iː|n|oʊ}} or {{IPAc-en|nj|uː|ˈ|t|r|iː|n|oʊ}}) (denoted by the Greek letter [[Nu (letter)|ν]]) is a [[fermion]] (an [[elementary particle]] with [[spin-1/2|half-integer spin]]) that interacts only via the [[weak interaction|weak subatomic force]] and [[gravity]].&lt;ref name="Close"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jayawardhana"/&gt; The [[mass]] of the neutrino is much smaller than that of the other known elementary particles.&lt;ref name="Mertens"/&gt; Although only differences of squares of the three mass values are known as of 2016,&lt;ref name="Capozzi"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Capozzi|first1=F. |last2=Lisi |first2=E. |last3=Marrone |first3=A. |last4=Montanino |first4=D. |last5=Palazzo |first5=A. |year=2016 |title=Neutrino masses and mixings: Status of known and unknown 3ν parameters |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=908 |pages=218–234 |arxiv=1601.07777 |bibcode=2016NuPhB.908..218C |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2016.02.016|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosmology|cosmological]] observations imply that the sum of the three masses must be less than one millionth that of the electron.&lt;ref name="Mertens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PDG mass sum"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olive |first=K.

[[Weak interactions]] create neutrinos in one of three leptonic [[Flavor (particle physics)|flavors]]: [[electron neutrino]]s {{nowrap|({{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}),}} [[muon neutrino]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}), or [[tau neutrino]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Tau neutrino}}), in association with the corresponding charged lepton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nakamura |first1=K. | last2=Petcov | first2=S.T. |journal=Chin.

A neutrino created with a specific flavor is in an associated specific [[quantum superposition]] of all three mass states. As a result, neutrinos [[Neutrino oscillation|oscillate]] between different flavors in flight. For example, an electron neutrino produced in a [[beta decay]] reaction may interact in a distant detector as a muon or tau neutrino.&lt;ref name="GrossmanLipkin"&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=hep-ph/9607201 |bibcode=1997PhRvD..55.2760G |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.2760 |title=Flavor oscillations from a spatially localized source — A simple general treatment |journal=Physical Review D |volume=55 |issue=5 |page=2760 | year=1997 |last1=Grossman |first1=Juval |last2=Lipkin |first2= Harry J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilenky"&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1602.00170 |bibcode=2016NuPhB.908....2B |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2016.01.025 |title=Neutrino oscillations: From a historical perspective to the present status |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=908 |pages=2–13 |year=2016 |first1=S. |last1=Bilenky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each neutrino, there also exists a corresponding [[antiparticle]], called an [[#Antineutrinos|''antineutrino'']], which also has half-integer spin and no electric charge. They are distinguished from the neutrinos by having opposite signs of [[lepton number]] and [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]]. To conserve total lepton number, in nuclear [[beta decay]], electron neutrinos appear together with only positrons (anti-electrons) or electron-antineutrinos, and electron antineutrinos with electrons or electron neutrinos.&lt;ref name="Neutrinos"&gt;{{cite web| title=Neutrinos | url=http://www.particlecentral.com/neutrinos_page.html |publisher=Four Peaks Technologies |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservation of lepton number"&gt;{{cite web |title=Conservation of lepton number |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/particles/parint.html#c3 |series=HyperPhysics |publisher=Georgia State University |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutrinos are created by various [[radioactive decay]]s, including in [[beta decay]] of [[atomic nuclei]] or [[hadron]]s, [[nuclear reaction]]s such as those that take place in the core of a [[star]] or artificially in [[nuclear reactor]]s, [[nuclear bomb]]s or [[particle accelerator]]s, during a [[supernova]], in the spin-down of a [[neutron star]], or when accelerated particle beams or [[cosmic ray]]s strike atoms. The majority of neutrinos in the vicinity of the Earth are from nuclear reactions in the Sun.

For study, neutrinos can be created artificially with nuclear reactors and particle accelerators. There is intense research activity involving neutrinos, with goals that include the determination of the three neutrino mass values, the measurement of the degree of [[CP violation]] in the leptonic sector (leading to [[Leptogenesis (physics)|leptogenesis]]); and searches for evidence of physics beyond the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]], such as [[neutrinoless double beta decay]], which would be evidence for violation of lepton number conservation.

==History==

===Pauli's proposal===
The neutrino&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;More specifically, Pauli postulated what is now called the ''electron neutrino''. Two other types were discovered later: ''see'' [[#Neutrino_flavors_anchor|Neutrino flavor]] ''below''.&lt;/ref&gt; was postulated first by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in 1930 to explain how [[beta decay]] could conserve [[conservation of energy|energy]], [[conservation of momentum|momentum]], and [[conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]] ([[Spin (physics)|spin]]). In contrast to [[Niels Bohr]], who proposed a statistical version of the conservation laws to explain the observed [[Beta decay#Neutrinos in beta decay|continuous energy spectra in beta decay]], Pauli hypothesized an undetected particle that he called a "neutron", using the same ''-on'' ending employed for naming both the [[proton]] and the [[electron]]. He considered that the new particle was emitted from the nucleus together with the electron or beta particle in the process of beta decay.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode= 1978PhT....31i..23B |doi=10.1063/1.2995181 |title=The idea of the neutrino |journal=Physics Today |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=23–28 |year=1978 |last1=Brown |first1=Laurie M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[Niels Bohr]] was notably opposed to this interpretation of beta decay – he was ready to accept that energy, momentum, and angular momentum were not conserved quantities at the atomic level.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Chadwick]] discovered a much more massive neutral nuclear particle in 1932 and named it a [[neutron]] also, leaving two kinds of particles with the same name. Earlier (in 1930) Pauli had used the term "neutron" for both the neutral particle that conserved energy in beta decay, and a presumed neutral particle in the nucleus; initially he did not consider these two neutral particles as distinct from each other.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; The word "neutrino" entered the scientific vocabulary through [[Enrico Fermi]], who used it during a conference in Paris in July&amp;nbsp;1932 and at the Solvay Conference in October&amp;nbsp;1933, where Pauli also employed it. The name (the [[Italian language|Italian]] equivalent of "little neutral one") was jokingly coined by [[Edoardo Amaldi]] during a conversation with Fermi at the Institute of Physics of via Panisperna in Rome, in order to distinguish this light neutral particle from Chadwick's heavy neutron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Amaldi, E. |date=1984 |title=From the discovery of the neutron to the discovery of nuclear fission |journal=Phys. Rep. |volume=111 |issue=1–4 |page=306 |bibcode=1984PhR...111....1A |doi=10.1016/0370-1573(84)90214-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Fermi's interaction|Fermi's theory of beta decay]], Chadwick's large neutral particle could decay to a proton, electron, and the smaller neutral particle (now called an ''electron antineutrino''):
:{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron-}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}}

Fermi's paper, written in 1934, unified Pauli's neutrino with [[Paul Dirac]]'s [[positron]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s neutron–proton model and gave a solid theoretical basis for future experimental work. The journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] rejected Fermi's paper, saying that the theory was "too remote from reality". He submitted the paper to an Italian journal, which accepted it, but the general lack of interest in his theory at that early date caused him to switch to experimental physics.&lt;ref name=Close2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Close, F. |date=2012 |title=Neutrino |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0199695997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fermi, E. |date=1934 |title=Versuch einer Theorie der β-Strahlen.

By 1934 there was experimental evidence against Bohr's idea that energy conservation is invalid for beta decay: At the [[Solvay conference]] of that year, measurements of the energy spectra of beta particles (electrons) were reported, showing that there is a strict limit on the energy of electrons from each type of beta decay. Such a limit is not expected if the conservation of energy is invalid, in which case any amount of energy would be statistically available in at least a few decays. The natural explanation of the beta decay spectrum as first measured in 1934 was that only a limited (and conserved) amount of energy was available, and a new particle was sometimes taking a varying fraction of this limited energy, leaving the rest for the beta particle. Pauli made use of the occasion to publicly emphasize that the still-undetected "neutrino" must be an actual particle.&lt;ref name=Close2012/&gt;{{rp|25}}

===Direct detection===

In 1942, [[Wang Ganchang]] first proposed the use of [[Electron capture|beta capture]] to experimentally detect neutrinos.&lt;ref&gt;

In this experiment, now known as the [[Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment]], antineutrinos created in a nuclear reactor by beta decay reacted with protons to produce [[neutron]]s and [[positron]]s:

:{{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron+}}

The positron quickly finds an electron, and they [[Annihilation|annihilate]] each other. The two resulting [[gamma ray]]s (γ) are detectable. The neutron can be detected by its capture on an appropriate nucleus, releasing a gamma ray. The coincidence of both events – positron annihilation and neutron capture – gives a unique signature of an antineutrino interaction.

In February 1965, the first neutrino found in nature was identified in one of South Africa's gold mines by a group which included [[Friedel Sellschop]].&lt;ref&gt; "National Awards and Honors".

Retrieved 2007-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment was performed in a specially prepared chamber at a depth of 3 km in the ERPM mine near Boksburg. A plaque in the main building commemorates the discovery. The experiments also implemented a primitive neutrino astronomy and looked at issues of neutrino physics and weak interactions.&lt;ref&gt; R Tegen (2001). "A review of the SA Neutrino experiment".

===Neutrino flavor{{anchor|Neutrino_flavors_anchor}}===
The antineutrino discovered by Cowan and Reines is the antiparticle of the [[electron neutrino]].

In 1962, [[Leon M. Lederman]], [[Melvin Schwartz]] and [[Jack Steinberger]] showed that more than one type of neutrino exists by first detecting interactions of the [[muon]] neutrino (already hypothesised with the name ''neutretto''),&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |first=I. V. |last=Anicin |date=2005 |title=The neutrino – its past, present, and future |journal=SFIN (Institute of Physics, Belgrade) Year XV |series=A: Conferences |id=No. A (00) |volume=2 |issue=2002 |pages=3–59 |arxiv=physics/0503172 |bibcode=2005physics...3172A}}&lt;/ref&gt; which earned them the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|1988 Nobel Prize in Physics]].

When the third type of [[lepton]], the [[tau (particle)|tau]], was discovered in 1975 at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]], it too was expected to have an associated neutrino (the tau neutrino). First evidence for this third neutrino type came from the observation of missing energy and momentum in tau decays analogous to the beta decay leading to the discovery of the electron neutrino. The first detection of tau neutrino interactions was announced in 2000 by the [[DONUT|DONUT collaboration]] at [[Fermilab]]; its existence had already been inferred by both theoretical consistency and experimental data from the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]].&lt;ref name=tauonpress&gt;{{cite news |date=20 July 2000 |title=Physicists find first direct evidence for Tau neutrino at Fermilab |url=http://www.fnal.gov/pub/presspass/press_releases/donut.html |publisher=Fermilab |quote=In 1989, experimenters at CERN found proof that the tau neutrino is the third and last light neutrino of the Standard Model, but a direct observation was not yet feasible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar neutrino problem===
{{Main|Solar neutrino problem}}
In the 1960s, the now-famous [[Homestake experiment]] made the first measurement of the flux of electron neutrinos arriving from the core of the Sun and found a value that was between one third and one half the number predicted by the [[Standard Solar Model]]. This discrepancy, which became known as the [[solar neutrino problem]], remained unresolved for some thirty years, while possible problems with both the experiment and the solar model were investigated, but none could be found. Eventually it was realized that both were correct, but rather it was the neutrinos themselves that were far more interesting than expected.  It was postulated that the three neutrinos had nonzero and slightly but indistinguishably different masses, and could therefore oscillate into undetectable flavors on their flight to the Earth.  This hypothesis was investigated by a new series of experiments, thereby opening a new major field of research that still continues.  Eventual confirmation of the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation led to two Nobel prizes, to [[Raymond Davis, Jr.]], who conceived and led the Homestake experiment, and to [[Arthur B. McDonald|Art McDonald]], who led the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory|SNO]] experiment, which could detect all of the neutrino flavors and found no deficit.&lt;ref name=SNO2001/&gt;

===Oscillation===
{{main|Neutrino oscillation}}
A practical method for investigating neutrino oscillations was first suggested by [[Bruno Pontecorvo]] in 1957 using an analogy with [[kaon]] [[kaon oscillation|oscillations]]; over the subsequent 10 years he developed the mathematical formalism and the modern formulation of vacuum oscillations. In 1985 [[Stanislav Mikheyev]] and [[Alexei Smirnov (physicist)|Alexei Smirnov]] (expanding on 1978 work by [[Lincoln Wolfenstein]]) noted that flavor oscillations can be modified when neutrinos propagate through matter. This so-called [[Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect]] (MSW effect) is important to understand because many neutrinos emitted by fusion in the Sun pass through the dense matter in the [[solar core]] (where essentially all solar fusion takes place) on their way to detectors on Earth.

Starting in 1998, experiments began to show that solar and atmospheric neutrinos change flavors (see [[Super-Kamiokande]] and [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]]). This resolved the solar neutrino problem: the electron neutrinos produced in the Sun had partly changed into other flavors which the experiments could not detect.

Although individual experiments, such as the set of solar neutrino experiments, are consistent with non-oscillatory mechanisms of neutrino flavor conversion, taken altogether, neutrino experiments imply the existence of neutrino oscillations. Especially relevant in this context are the reactor experiment [[KamLAND]] and the accelerator experiments such as [[MINOS]]. The KamLAND experiment has indeed identified oscillations as the neutrino flavor conversion mechanism involved in the solar electron neutrinos. Similarly MINOS confirms the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos and gives a better determination of the mass squared splitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Maltoni |author2=T. Schwetz |author3=M. Tórtola |author4=J. W. F. Valle |date=2004 |title=Status of global fits to neutrino oscillations |journal=[[New Journal of Physics]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=122 |arxiv=hep-ph/0405172 |bibcode=2004NJPh....6..122M |doi=10.1088/1367-2630/6/1/122}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Takaaki Kajita]] of Japan and [[Arthur B. McDonald]] of Canada received the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physics for their landmark finding, theoretical and experimental, that neutrinos can change flavors.

===Cosmic neutrinos===
Raymond Davis, Jr. and [[Masatoshi Koshiba]] were jointly awarded the 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. Both conducted pioneering work on [[solar neutrino]] detection, and Koshiba's work also resulted in the first real-time observation of neutrinos from the [[SN 1987A]] [[supernova]] in the nearby [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. These efforts marked the beginning of [[neutrino astronomy]].&lt;ref name= "Pagliaroli2009"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2009APh....31..163P |title=Improved analysis of SN1987A antineutrino events |journal=Astroparticle Physics |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=163–176 |author1=Pagliaroli |first1=G.|last2=Vissani |first2=F. |last3=Costantini |first3=M.

==Properties and reactions==
The neutrino has half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]] (½&amp;#x202f;ħ) and is therefore a [[fermion]]. Also being leptons, neutrinos have been observed to interact through only the [[weak nuclear force|weak force]], although it is assumed that they also interact gravitationally.

===Flavor, mass, and their mixing===
Weak interactions create neutrinos in one of three leptonic [[Flavor (particle physics)|flavors]]: [[electron neutrino]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}), [[muon neutrino]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}), or [[tau neutrino]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Tau neutrino}}), in association with the corresponding [[electron]], [[muon]], and [[tau (particle)|tau]] charged leptons, respectively.&lt;ref name="PDG mixing"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nakamura |first1=K. |last2=Petcov |first2=S.T. |journal=Chin.

Although neutrinos were long believed to be massless, it is now known that there are also three discrete neutrino masses, but they don't correspond uniquely to the three flavors. Although only differences of squares of the three mass values are known as of 2016,&lt;ref name="Capozzi"/&gt; experiments have shown that these masses are tiny in magnitude. From [[cosmology|cosmological]] measurements, it has been calculated that the sum of the three neutrino masses must be less than one millionth that of the electron.&lt;ref name="Mertens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PDG mass sum"/&gt;

More formally, neutrino flavor [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstates]] are not the same as the neutrino mass eigenstates (simply labelled 1, 2, 3). As of 2016, it is not known which of these three is the heaviest. In analogy with the mass hierarchy of the charged leptons, the configuration with mass&amp;nbsp;2 being lighter than mass&amp;nbsp;3 is conventionally called the "normal hierarchy", while in the "inverted hierarchy", the opposite would hold. Several major experimental efforts are underway to help establish which is correct.&lt;ref name="hierarchy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neutrino mass hierarchy |url=http://www.hyper-k.org/en/physics/phys-hierarchy.html |publisher=[[Kamioka Observatory#Hyper-Kamiokande|Hyper-Kamiokande]] |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A neutrino created in a specific flavor eigenstate is in an associated specific [[quantum superposition]] of all three mass eigenstates.  This is possible because the three masses differ so little that they cannot be experimentally distinguished within any practical flight path, due to the [[uncertainty principle]].  The proportion of each mass state in the produced pure flavor state has been found to depend strongly on that flavor. The relationship between flavor and mass eigenstates is encoded in the [[PMNS matrix]]. Experiments have established values for the elements of this matrix.&lt;ref name="Capozzi"/&gt;

The existence of a neutrino mass allows the possibility of a tiny neutrino [[magnetic moment]], in which case neutrinos could interact electromagnetically as well; no such interaction has been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Giunti |first=Carlo |last2=Studenikin |first2=Alexander |year=2015 |title=Neutrino electromagnetic interactions: A window to new physics |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=531–591 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.87.531 |arxiv=1403.6344 |bibcode=2015RvMP...87..531G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flavor oscillations===
{{Main|Neutrino oscillation}}
Neutrinos [[Neutrino oscillation|oscillate]] between different flavors in flight. For example, an electron neutrino produced in a [[beta decay]] reaction may interact in a distant detector as a muon or tau neutrino, as defined by the flavor of the charged lepton produced in the detector. This oscillation occurs because the three mass state components of the produced flavor travel at slightly different speeds, so that their quantum mechanical [[wave packet]]s develop relative [[Phase (waves)#phase shift|phase shift]]s that change how they combine to produce a varying superposition of three flavors. Each flavor component thereby oscillates [[Sine wave|sinusoidally]] as the neutrino travels, with the flavors varying in relative strengths.  The relative flavor proportions when the neutrino interacts represent the relative probabilities for that flavor of interaction to produce the corresponding flavor of charged lepton.&lt;ref name="GrossmanLipkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilenky"/&gt;

There are other possibilities in which neutrino could oscillate even if they were massless. If [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz symmetry]] were not an exact symmetry, neutrinos could experience [[Lorentz-violating neutrino oscillations|Lorentz-violating oscillations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=hep-ph/0309025 |bibcode=2004PhRvD..69a6005A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.69.016005 |title=Lorentz andCPTviolation in neutrinos |journal=Physical Review D |volume=69 |issue=1 |page=016005 |year=2004 |last1=Alan Kostelecký |first1=V. |last2=Mewes |first2=Matthew |hdl=2022/18691 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect===
{{Main|Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect}}
Neutrinos traveling through matter, in general, undergo a process analogous to [[Speed of light#In a medium|light traveling through a transparent material]]. This process is not directly observable because it does not produce [[ionizing radiation]], but gives rise to the [[MSW effect]]. Only a small fraction of the neutrino's energy is transferred to the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2015/advanced-physicsprize2015.pdf |series=Scientific background on the Nobel Prize in Physics |year=2015 |title=Neutrino Oscillations |pages=15–16 |department=Class for Physics of the RSAC |publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences |website=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antineutrinos===
{{antimatter}}
For each neutrino, there also exists a corresponding [[antiparticle]], called an ''antineutrino'', which also has no electric charge and half-integer spin. They are distinguished from the neutrinos by having opposite signs of [[lepton number]] and opposite [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]]. As of 2016, no evidence has been found for any other difference.  In all observations so far of leptonic processes (despite extensive and continuing searches for exceptions), there is no overall change in lepton number; for example, if total lepton number is zero in the initial state, electron neutrinos appear in the final state together with only positrons (anti-electrons) or electron-antineutrinos, and electron antineutrinos with electrons or electron neutrinos.&lt;ref name="Neutrinos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservation of lepton number"/&gt;

Antineutrinos are produced in [[nuclear reaction|nuclear]] [[beta decay]] together with a [[beta particle]], in which, e.g., a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino. All antineutrinos observed thus far possess right-handed [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] (i.e. only one of the two possible spin states has ever been seen), while neutrinos are left-handed. Nevertheless, as neutrinos have mass, their helicity is [[Frame of reference|frame]]-dependent, so it is the related frame-independent property of chirality that is relevant here.

Antineutrinos were first detected as a result of their interaction with protons in a large tank of water. This was installed next to a nuclear reactor as a controllable source of the antineutrinos (See: [[Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment]]).
Researchers around the world have begun to investigate the possibility of using antineutrinos for reactor monitoring in the context of preventing the [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation of nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006 |publisher=LLNL/SNL |title=Applied Antineutrino Physics Project |id=LLNL-WEB-204112 |url=http://neutrinos.llnl.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |date=2007 |conference=Applied Antineutrino Physics |title=Workshop |url=http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/AAP2007/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112083328/http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/AAP2007/ |archivedate=2007-11-12 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=13 March 2008 |title=New tool to monitor nuclear reactors developed |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=2008-03-16 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080313091522.htm |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majorana mass===
{{See also|seesaw mechanism}}
Because antineutrinos and neutrinos are neutral particles, it is possible that they are the same particle. Particles that have this property are known as [[Majorana particle]]s, after the Italian physicist [[Ettore Majorana]] who first proposed the concept. For the case of neutrinos this theory has gained popularity as it can be used, in combination with the [[seesaw mechanism]], to explain why neutrino masses are so small compared to those of the other elementary particles, such as electrons or quarks. Majorana neutrinos have the property that the neutrino and antineutrino could be distinguished only by [[chirality (physics)|chirality]]; what experiments observe as a difference between the neutrino and antineutrino could simply be due to one particle with two possible chiralities.

It is not yet known whether neutrinos are [[Majorana particle|Majorana]] or [[Dirac fermion|Dirac]] particles; it is possible to test this property experimentally. For example, if neutrinos are indeed Majorana particles, then lepton-number violating processes such as [[neutrinoless double beta decay]] would be allowed, while they would not if neutrinos are [[Dirac fermion|Dirac]] particles. Several experiments have been and are being conducted to search for this process, e.g. [[Germanium Detector Array|GERDA]].&lt;ref name="neutrino-fundamentals"&gt;{{cite book |first1=C. |last1=Giunti |first2=C.W. |last2=Kim |date=2007 |title=Fundamentals of Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SdAcSwTR0CgC&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;dq=majorana%20neutrino%20helicity&amp;pg=PA255 |page=255 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-850871-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SNO+]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andringa|first=S.|last2=Arushanova|first2=E.|last3=Asahi|first3=S.|last4=Askins|first4=M.|last5=Auty|first5=D.

===Nuclear reactions===
Neutrinos can interact with a nucleus, changing it to another nucleus. This process is used in radiochemical [[neutrino detector]]s. In this case, the energy levels and spin states within the target nucleus have to be taken into account to estimate the probability for an interaction. In general the interaction probability increases with the number of neutrons and protons within a nucleus.&lt;ref name=SNO2001&gt;

It is very hard to uniquely identify neutrino interactions among the natural background of radioactivity. For this reason, in early experiments a special reaction channel was chosen to facilitate the identification: the interaction of an antineutrino with one of the hydrogen nuclei in the water molecules. A hydrogen nucleus is a single proton, so simultaneous nuclear interactions, which would occur within a heavier nucleus, don't need to be considered for the detection experiment. Within a cubic metre of water placed right outside a nuclear reactor, only relatively few such interactions can be recorded, but the setup is now used for measuring the reactor's plutonium production rate.

===Induced fission===
Very much like [[neutron]]s do in [[nuclear reactor]]s, neutrinos can induce [[fission reaction]]s within heavy [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/0308350 |bibcode=2004PhRvL..92k1101K |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.111101 |pmid=15089120 |title=Neutrino-Induced Fission of Neutron-Rich Nuclei |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=92 |issue=11 |page=111101 |year=2004 |last1=Kolbe |first1=E. |last2=Langanke |first2=K. |last3=Fuller |first3=G. M. |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/638993 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, this reaction has not been measured in a laboratory, but is predicted to happen within stars and supernovae. The process affects the [[Abundance of the chemical elements#Abundance of elements in the Universe|abundance of isotopes]] seen in the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="PhLB. 2005"/&gt; Neutrino fission of [[deuterium]] nuclei has been observed in the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]], which uses a [[heavy water]] detector.

=== No self interaction ===

There are three known types (''[[flavor (particle physics)|flavors]]'') of neutrinos: electron neutrino {{SubatomicParticle|electron neutrino}}, muon neutrino {{SubatomicParticle|muon neutrino}} and tau neutrino {{SubatomicParticle|tau neutrino}}, named after their partner [[lepton]]s in the [[Standard Model]] (see table at right). The current best measurement of the number of neutrino types comes from observing the decay of the [[W and Z bosons|Z boson]]. This particle can decay into any light neutrino and its antineutrino, and the more types of light neutrinos&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In this context, "light neutrino" means neutrinos with less than half the mass of the Z&amp;nbsp;boson.&lt;/ref&gt; available, the shorter the lifetime of the Z&amp;nbsp;boson. Measurements of the Z lifetime have shown that the number of light neutrino flavors that couple to the Z is 3.&lt;ref name="PDG mixing"/&gt; The correspondence between the six [[quark]]s in the Standard Model and the six leptons, among them the three neutrinos, suggests to physicists' intuition that there should be exactly three types of neutrino. Proof that there are only three kinds of neutrinos remains an elusive goal of particle physics.

==Research==
There are several active research areas involving the neutrino. Some are concerned with testing predictions of neutrino behavior. Other research is focused on measurement of unknown properties of neutrinos, especially their masses and [[CP violation]], as they cannot be predicted with existing theories.

===Detectors near artificial neutrino sources===
International scientific collaborations install large neutrino detectors near nuclear reactors or in neutrino beams from particle accelerators to better constrain the neutrino masses and the values for the magnitude and rates of oscillations between neutrino flavors. These experiments are thereby searching for the existence of CP violation in the neutrino sector; that is, whether or not the laws of physics treat neutrinos and antineutrinos differently.&lt;ref name="Capozzi"/&gt;

The [[KATRIN]] experiment in Germany has begun to acquire data in June 2018&lt;ref name=katrin_start&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pro-physik.de/details/physiknews/11069692/Die_Neutrino-Waage_geht_in_Betrieb.html |title=Die Neutrino-Waage geht in Betrieb Physik Journal |department=Physik News |website=pro-physik.de |date=2018-06-12 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the value of the mass of the electron neutrino, with other approaches to this problem in the planning stages.&lt;ref name="Mertens"/&gt;

===Tests of neutrino oscillation===
On 19&amp;nbsp;July 2013, the results from the [[T2K experiment]] presented at the [[European Physical Society]] Conference on High Energy Physics in Stockholm, Sweden, confirmed neutrino oscillation theory.&lt;ref name="PhysicsNews20130719"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.physnews.com/physics-news/cluster637855326/ |title=Neutrino shape-shift points to new physics |newspaper=Physics News |date=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC20130719"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23366318 |title=Neutrino 'flavour' flip confirmed |publisher=BBC News |date=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravitational effects===
Despite their tiny masses, neutrinos are so numerous that their gravitational force can influence other matter in the universe.

The three known neutrino flavors are the only established [[elementary particle]] candidates for [[dark matter]], specifically [[hot dark matter]], although that possibility appears to be largely ruled out by observations of the [[cosmic microwave background]]. If heavier sterile neutrinos exist, they might serve as [[warm dark matter]], which still seems plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume=72 |number=17 |year=1994 |pages=17–20 |title=Sterile neutrinos as dark matter |first1=Scott |last1=Dodelson |first2=Lawrence M. |last2=Widrow |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.72.17 |pmid=10055555 |bibcode=1994PhRvL..72...17D |journal=Physical Review Letters |arxiv=hep-ph/9303287 |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/248005 |type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sterile neutrino searches===
Other efforts search for evidence of a [[sterile neutrino]] – a fourth neutrino flavor that does not interact with matter like the three known neutrino flavors.&lt;ref name="Quanta"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=On a hunt for a ghost of a particle |magazine=[[Quanta Magazine]] |publisher=[[Simons Foundation]] |date=8 December 2016 |first1=Maggie |last1=McKee }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WhitePaper"&gt;{{cite report |arxiv=1204.5379 |bibcode=2012arXiv1204.5379A |title=Light Sterile Neutrinos |series=White Paper |year=2012 |first1=K.

Therefore, heavy sterile neutrinos would have a mass of at least 45.6&amp;nbsp;GeV.

The existence of such particles is in fact hinted by experimental data from the [[LSND]] experiment. On the other hand, the currently running [[MiniBooNE]] experiment suggested that sterile neutrinos are not required to explain the experimental data,&lt;ref name="PhysRevD"&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=hep-ph/0609177 |bibcode=2007PhRvD..75a3011K |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.75.013011 |title=LeptonicCPviolation studies at MiniBooNE in the (3+2) sterile neutrino oscillation hypothesis |journal=Physical Review D |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=013011 |year=2007 |last1=Karagiorgi |first1=G. |last2=Aguilar-Arevalo |first2=A. |last3=Conrad |first3=J.

===Neutrinoless double-beta decay searches===
Another hypothesis concerns "neutrinoless double-beta decay", which, if it exists, would violate lepton number conservation and imply a minuscule splitting (or difference) between the physical masses of what are conventionally called a “neutrino” and its corresponding “antineutrino” having the opposite sign in its lepton number. Searches for this mechanism are underway but have not yet found strong evidenced for it. If they were to, then what are now called antineutrinos could not be true antiparticles. The resulting ''six'' distinct neutrinos would have no distinct antiparticle partner.&lt;ref name="PDG 0nu2beta"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vogel |first1=P. | last2=Piepke |first2=A. |journal= Chin.

===Speed===
{{Main|Measurements of neutrino speed}}

Before neutrinos were found to oscillate, they were generally assumed to be massless, propagating at the [[speed of light]]. According to the theory of [[special relativity]], the question of neutrino [[velocity]] is closely related to their [[mass]]: if neutrinos are massless, they must travel at the speed of light, and if they have mass they cannot reach the speed of light. Due to their tiny mass, the predicted speed is extremely close to the speed of light in all experiments, and current detectors are not sensitive to the expected difference.

Also some [[Lorentz violation|Lorentz-violating]] variants of [[quantum gravity]] might allow faster-than-light neutrinos. A comprehensive framework for Lorentz violations is the [[Standard-Model Extension]] (SME).

In the early 1980s, first measurements of neutrino speed were done using pulsed [[pion]] beams (produced by pulsed proton beams hitting a target). The pions decayed producing neutrinos, and the neutrino interactions observed within a time window in a detector at a distance were consistent with the speed of light. This measurement was repeated in 2007 using the [[MINOS]] detectors, which found the speed of {{val|3|ul=GeV}} neutrinos to be, at the 99% confidence level, in the range between {{val|0.999976|ul=c}} and {{val|1.000126|ul=c}}.  The central value of 1.000051''c'' is higher than the speed of light but is also consistent with a velocity of exactly ''c'' or even slightly less.

A similar observation was made, on a much larger scale, with [[supernova 1987A]] (SN 1987A). 10&amp;nbsp;MeV antineutrinos from the supernova were detected within a time window that was consistent with the speed of light for the neutrinos.

In September&amp;nbsp;2011, the [[OPERA experiment|OPERA collaboration]] released calculations showing velocities of 17&amp;nbsp;GeV and 28&amp;nbsp;GeV neutrinos exceeding the speed of light in their experiments (see [[Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly]]). In November&amp;nbsp;2011, OPERA repeated its experiment with changes so that the speed could be determined individually for each detected neutrino. The results showed the same faster-than-light speed. In February&amp;nbsp;2012, reports came out that the results may have been caused by a loose fiber optic cable attached to one of the atomic clocks which measured the departure and arrival times of the neutrinos. An independent recreation of the experiment in the same laboratory by [[ICARUS (experiment)|ICARUS]] found no discernible difference between the speed of a neutrino and the speed of light.&lt;ref name="Arxiv-20120316"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2012.05.033 |arxiv=1203.3433 |bibcode = 2012PhLB..713...17I |title=Measurement of the neutrino velocity with the ICARUS detector at the CNGS beam |journal=Physics Letters B |volume=713 |pages=17–22 |year=2012 |last1=Antonello |first1=M. |last2=Aprili |first2=P. |last3=Baiboussinov |first3=B. |last4=Baldo Ceolin |first4=M. |last5=Benetti |first5=P. |last6=Calligarich |first6=E. |last7=Canci |first7=N. |last8=Centro |first8=S. |last9=Cesana |first9=A. |last10=Cieślik |first10=K. |last11=Cline |first11=D.B. |last12=Cocco |first12=A.G. |last13=Dabrowska |first13=A. |last14=Dequal |first14=D. |last15=Dermenev |first15=A. |last16=Dolfini |first16=R. |last17=Farnese |first17=C. |last18=Fava |first18=A. |last19=Ferrari |first19=A. |last20=Fiorillo |first20=G. |last21=Gibin |first21=D. |last22=Gigli Berzolari |first22=A. |last23=Gninenko |first23=S. |last24=Guglielmi |first24=A. |last25=Haranczyk |first25=M. |last26=Holeczek |first26=J. |last27=Ivashkin |first27=A. |last28=Kisiel |first28=J. |last29=Kochanek |first29=I. |last30=Lagoda |first30=J. |display-authors=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass===
{{unsolved|physics|Can we measure the neutrino masses? Do neutrinos follow [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Dirac]] or [[Majorana fermion|Majorana]] statistics?}}
The [[Standard Model]] of particle physics assumed that neutrinos are massless. The experimentally established phenomenon of neutrino oscillation, which mixes neutrino flavour states with neutrino mass states (analogously to [[Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix|CKM mixing]]), requires neutrinos to have nonzero masses.&lt;ref name="PhysRevD1"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1980PhRvD..22.2227S |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.22.2227 |title=Neutrino masses in SU(2) ⊗ U(1) theories |journal=Physical Review D |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=2227–2235 |year=1980 |last1=Schechter |first1=J. |last2=Valle |first2=J.W.F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massive neutrinos were originally conceived by [[Bruno Pontecorvo]] in the 1950s. Enhancing the basic framework to accommodate their mass is straightforward by adding a right-handed Lagrangian.

Providing for neutrino mass can be done in two ways, and some proposals use both:
#If, like other fundamental Standard Model particles, mass is generated by the [[Dirac fermion|Dirac mechanism]], then the framework would require an [[Special unitary group#n = 2|SU(2) singlet]]. This particle would have the [[Yukawa interaction]]s with the neutral component of the [[Higgs boson|Higgs]] [[Doublet state|doublet]], but otherwise would have no interactions with Standard Model particles, so is called a “sterile” neutrino.
#Or, mass can be  generated by the [[Majorana mass|Majorana mechanism]], which would require the neutrino and antineutrino to be the same particle.

The strongest upper limit on the masses of neutrinos comes from [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]: the [[Big Bang]] model predicts that there is a fixed ratio between the number of neutrinos and the number of [[photon]]s in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background]]. If the total energy of all three types of neutrinos exceeded an average of {{val|50|ul=eV}} per neutrino, there would be so much mass in the universe that it would collapse.&lt;ref name="Hut1979"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0370-2693(79)90039-X |bibcode=1979PhLB...87..144H |title=A cosmological upper limit on the mass of heavy neutrinos |journal=Physics Letters B |volume=87 |issue=1–2 |pages=144–146 |year=1979 |last1=Hut |first1=P. |last2=Olive |first2=K.A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This limit can be circumvented by assuming that the neutrino is unstable, but there are limits within the Standard Model that make this difficult. A much more stringent constraint comes from a careful analysis of cosmological data, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, [[galaxy survey]]s, and the [[Lyman-alpha forest]]. These indicate that the summed masses of the three neutrinos must be less than {{val|0.3|u=eV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/0602155 |bibcode=2006JCAP...06..019G |doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2006/06/019 |title=The neutrino mass bound from WMAP 3&amp;nbsp;year data, the baryon acoustic peak, the SNLS supernovae and the Lyman-α forest |journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics |volume=2006 |issue=6 |page=019 |year=2006 |last1=Goobar |first1=Ariel |last2=Hannestad |first2=Steen |last3=Mörtsell |first3=Edvard |last4=Tu |first4=Huitzu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, research results at the [[Super-Kamiokande]] neutrino detector determined that neutrinos can oscillate from one flavor to another, which requires that they must have a nonzero mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=hep-ex/9805021 |bibcode=1998PhRvL..81.1158F |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.1158 |title=Measurements of the Solar Neutrino Flux from Super-Kamiokande's First 300 Days |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=1158–1162 |year=1998 |last1=Fukuda |first1=Y. |last2=Hayakawa |first2=T. |last3=Ichihara |first3=E. |last4=Inoue |first4=K. |last5=Ishihara |first5=K. |last6=Ishino |first6=H. |last7=Itow |first7=Y. |last8=Kajita |first8=T. |last9=Kameda |first9=J. |last10=Kasuga |first10=S. |last11=Kobayashi |first11=K. |last12=Kobayashi |first12=Y. |last13=Koshio |first13=Y. |last14=Martens |first14=K. |last15=Miura |first15=M. |last16=Nakahata |first16=M. |last17=Nakayama |first17=S. |last18=Okada |first18=A. |last19=Oketa |first19=M. |last20=Okumura |first20=K. |last21=Ota |first21=M. |last22=Sakurai |first22=N. |last23=Shiozawa |first23=M. |last24=Suzuki |first24=Y. |last25=Takeuchi |first25=Y. |last26=Totsuka |first26=Y. |last27=Yamada |first27=S. |last28=Earl |first28=M. |last29=Habig |first29=A. |last30=Hong |first30=J.

If the neutrino is a [[Majorana fermion|Majorana particle]], the mass may be calculated by finding the [[half-life]] of [[Double beta decay|neutrinoless double-beta decay]] of certain nuclei.

===Size===
Standard Model neutrinos are fundamental point-like particles, without any width or volume. Since the neutrino is an elementary particle it does not have a size in the same sense as everyday objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |date=2 June 2009 |work=National Geographic News |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090602-particles-larger-than-galaxies.html |title=Particles Larger than Galaxies Fill the Universe?}}&lt;/ref&gt; An effective size can be defined using their electroweak [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] (apparent size in [[electroweak interaction]]). The characteristic areas for the electroweak interaction are measured in units called [[Barn (unit)|nanobarn]]s&amp;nbsp;(nb) which are 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm² or 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m², roughly the area of a disc a little more than 0.3&amp;nbsp;[[Orders of magnitude (length)#1 attometre|attometer]] in diameter, or about 1 billionth of the size of a uranium nucleus. The electron neutrino cross section is 3.2&amp;nbsp; nanobarns the muon neutrino cross section is 1.7&amp;nbsp;nanobarns, and the tau neutrino 1.0&amp;nbsp;nanobarn. These scattering cross sections depend on no other properties than the masses of the corresponding charged leptons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1985PhRvD..31.1091L |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.31.1091 |pmid=9955801 |title=Characteristic size for the neutrino |journal=Physical Review D |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=1091–1096 |year=1985 |last1=Lucio |first1=J.

Properties associated with conventional "size" are absent: neutrinos cannot be condensed to form a separate uniform substance and they have no minimal distance between them.

===Chirality===
{{main|Sterile neutrino}}
Experimental results show that (nearly) all produced and observed neutrinos have left-handed [[Helicity (particle physics)|helicities]] (spins antiparallel to [[Momentum|momenta]]), and all antineutrinos have right-handed helicities, within the margin of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldhaber |first1=M. |last2=Grodzins |first2=L. |last3=Sunyar |first3=A. W. |date=1958-01-01 |title=Helicity of Neutrinos |journal=Physical Review |volume=109 |issue=3 |pages=1015–1017 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.109.1015 |bibcode=1958PhRv..109.1015G}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the massless limit, it means that only one of two possible [[chirality (physics)|chiralities]] is observed for either particle. These are the only chiralities included in the [[Standard Model]] of particle interactions.

It is possible that their counterparts (right-handed neutrinos and left-handed antineutrinos) simply do not exist. If they do, their properties are substantially different from observable neutrinos and antineutrinos. It is theorized that they are either very heavy (on the order of [[GUT scale]]—see ''[[Seesaw mechanism]]''), do not participate in weak interaction (so-called ''[[sterile neutrino]]s''), or both.

The existence of nonzero neutrino masses somewhat complicates the situation. Neutrinos are produced in weak interactions as chirality eigenstates. Chirality of a massive particle is not a constant of motion; helicity is, but the chirality operator does not share eigenstates with the helicity operator. Free neutrinos propagate as mixtures of left- and right-handed helicity states, with mixing amplitudes on the order of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;/''E''. This does not significantly affect the experiments, because neutrinos involved are nearly always ultrarelativistic, and thus mixing amplitudes are vanishingly small. Effectively, they travel so quickly and time passes so slowly in their rest-frames that they do not have enough time to change over any observable path. For example, most solar neutrinos have energies on the order of {{val|0.100|u=MeV}}–{{val|1|u=MeV}}, so the fraction of neutrinos with "wrong" helicity among them cannot exceed {{val|e=-10}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=B.

==Sources==

===Artificial===

====Reactor neutrinos====
[[Nuclear reactor]]s are the major source of human-generated neutrinos. The majority of energy in a nuclear reactor is generated by fission (the four main fissile isotopes in nuclear reactors are {{SimpleNuclide2|uranium|235|link=yes}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|uranium|238|link=yes}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|plutonium|239|link=yes}} and {{SimpleNuclide2|plutonium|241|link=yes}}), the resultant neutron-rich daughter nuclides rapidly undergo additional [[beta decay]]s, each converting one neutron to a proton and an electron and releasing an electron antineutrino ({{nobr|{{subatomic particle|neutron}} → {{subatomic particle|proton}} + {{subatomic particle|electron}} + {{subatomic particle|electron antineutrino}}}}). Including these subsequent decays, the average nuclear fission releases about {{val|200|u=MeV}} of energy, of which roughly 95.5% is retained in the core as heat, and roughly 4.5% (or about {{val|9|u=MeV}})&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is radiated away as antineutrinos. For a typical nuclear reactor with a thermal power of {{val|4000|ul=MW}},&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Like all [[thermal power plant]]s, only about one third of the heat generated can be converted to electricity, so a {{val|4000|u=MW}} reactor would produce only {{val|1300|u=MW}} of electric power, with {{val|2700|u=MW}} being [[waste heat]].&lt;/ref&gt; the total power production from fissioning atoms is actually {{val|4185|u=MW}}, of which {{val|185|u=MW}} is radiated away as antineutrino radiation and never appears in the engineering. This is to say, {{val|185|u=MW}} of fission energy is ''lost'' from this reactor and does not appear as heat available to run turbines, since antineutrinos penetrate all building materials practically without interaction.

The antineutrino energy spectrum depends on the degree to which the fuel is burned (plutonium-239 fission antineutrinos on average have slightly more energy than those from uranium-235 fission), but in general, the ''detectable'' antineutrinos from fission have a peak energy between about 3.5 and {{val|4|u=MeV}}, with a maximum energy of about {{val|10|u=MeV}}.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no established experimental method to measure the flux of low-energy antineutrinos. Only antineutrinos with an energy above threshold of {{val|1.8|u=MeV}} can trigger [[inverse beta decay]] and thus be unambiguously identified (see {{section link||Detection}} below). An estimated 3% of all antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor carry an energy above this threshold. Thus, an average nuclear power plant may generate over {{val|e=20}} antineutrinos per second above this threshold, but also a much larger number (97%/3% ≈ 30 times this number) below the energy threshold, which cannot be seen with present detector technology. The ND280 detector has been proposed as a viable safeguard unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=J. Carroll |author2=J. Coleman |author3=M. Lockwood |author4=C. Metelko |author5=M. Murdoch |author6=Y.

====Accelerator neutrinos====
Some [[particle accelerator]]s have been used to make neutrino beams. The technique is to collide [[proton]]s with a fixed target, producing charged [[pion]]s or [[kaon]]s. These unstable particles are then magnetically focused into a long tunnel where they decay while in flight. Because of the [[Lorentz transformation|relativistic boost]] of the decaying particle, the neutrinos are produced as a beam rather than isotropically. Efforts to construct an accelerator facility where neutrinos are produced through [[muon]] decays are ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |collaboration=[http://www.hep.ph.ic.ac.uk/iss/wg1-phys-phen/index.html ISS Physics Working Group] |displayauthors=1 |year=2009 |title=Physics at a future neutrino factory and super-beam facility |journal=[[Reports on Progress in Physics]] |volume=72 |issue=10 |page=6201 |arxiv=0710.4947 |bibcode=2009RPPh...72j6201B |doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/10/106201 |last1=Bandyopadhyay |first1=A. |last2=Choubey |last3=Gandhi |last4=Goswami |last5=Roberts |last6=Bouchez |last7=Antoniadis |last8=Ellis |last9=Giudice |last10=Schwetz |last11=Umasankar |last12=Karagiorgi |last13=Aguilar-Arevalo |last14=Conrad |last15=Shaevitz |last16=Pascoli |last17=Geer |last18=Campagne |last19=Rolinec |last20=Blondel |last21=Campanelli |last22=Kopp |last23=Lindner |last24=Peltoniemi |last25=Dornan |last26=Long |last27=Matsushita |last28=Rogers |last29=Uchida |last30=Dracos }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a setup is generally known as a [[Neutrino Factory|"neutrino factory"]].

====Nuclear weapons====
[[Nuclear weapon]]s also produce very large quantities of neutrinos. [[Fred Reines]] and [[Clyde Cowan]] considered the detection of neutrinos from a bomb prior to their search for reactor neutrinos; a fission reactor was recommended as a better alternative by Los Alamos physics division leader J.M.B. Kellogg.&lt;ref&gt;

===Geologic===
{{main|Geoneutrino}}
Neutrinos are produced together with the natural [[background radiation]]. In particular, the decay chains of {{SimpleNuclide2|uranium|238|link=yes}} and {{SimpleNuclide2|thorium|232|link=yes}} isotopes, as well as{{SimpleNuclide2|potassium|40|link=yes}}, include [[beta decay]]s which emit antineutrinos. These so-called geoneutrinos can provide valuable information on the Earth's interior. A first indication for geoneutrinos was found by the [[KamLAND]] experiment in 2005, updated results have been presented by KamLAND&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=KamLAND Collaboration |last2=Gando |first2=A. |last3=Gando |first3=Y. |last4=Hanakago |first4=H. |last5=Ikeda |first5=H. |last6=Inoue |first6=K. |last7=Ishidoshiro |first7=K. |last8=Ishikawa |first8=H. |last9=Koga |first9=M. |date=2013-08-02 |title=Reactor on-off antineutrino measurement with KamLAND |journal=Physical Review D |volume=88 |issue=3 |page=033001 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.033001 |bibcode=2013PhRvD..88c3001G |arxiv=1303.4667}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Borexino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Borexino Collaboration |last2=Agostini |first2=M. |last3=Appel |first3=S. |last4=Bellini |first4=G. |last5=Benziger |first5=J. |last6=Bick |first6=D. |last7=Bonfini |first7=G. |last8=Bravo |first8=D. |last9=Caccianiga |first9=B. |date=2015-08-07 |title=Spectroscopy of geoneutrinos from 2056&amp;nbsp;days of Borexino data |journal=Physical Review D |volume=92 |issue=3 |page=031101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.92.031101 |bibcode=2015PhRvD..92c1101A |arxiv=1506.04610}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main background in the geoneutrino measurements are the antineutrinos coming from reactors.

===Atmospheric===
Atmospheric neutrinos result from the interaction of [[cosmic ray]]s with atomic nuclei in the [[Earth's atmosphere]], creating showers of particles, many of which are unstable and produce neutrinos when they decay. A collaboration of particle physicists from [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] (India), [[Osaka City University]] (Japan) and [[Durham University]] (UK) recorded the first cosmic ray neutrino interaction in an underground laboratory in [[Kolar Gold Fields]] in India in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.

===Solar===
{{main|Solar neutrino}}
Solar neutrinos originate from the [[nuclear fusion]] powering the [[Sun]] and other stars.
The details of the operation of the Sun are explained by the [[Standard Solar Model]]. In short: when four protons fuse to become one [[helium]] nucleus, two of them have to convert into neutrons, and each such conversion releases one electron neutrino.

The Sun sends enormous numbers of neutrinos in all directions. Each second, about 65 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] ({{val|6.5|e=10}}) solar neutrinos pass through every square centimeter on the part of the Earth orthogonal to the direction of the Sun.&lt;ref name="J. Bahcall et al. 2005 L85–L88"/&gt; Since neutrinos are insignificantly absorbed by the mass of the Earth, the surface area on the side of the Earth opposite the Sun receives about the same number of neutrinos as the side facing the Sun.

When such stars collapse, matter [[densities]] at the core become so high ({{val|e=17|u=kg/m3}}) that the [[degeneracy pressure|degeneracy]] of electrons is not enough to prevent protons and electrons from combining to form a neutron and an electron neutrino. A second and more important neutrino source is the thermal energy (100&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]]s) of the newly formed neutron core, which is dissipated via the formation of neutrino–antineutrino pairs of all flavors.&lt;ref name=Mannbook&gt;

Colgate and White's theory of supernova neutrino production was confirmed in 1987, when neutrinos from [[SN 1987A|Supernova&amp;nbsp;1987A]] were detected. The water-based detectors [[Kamiokande II]] and [[Irvine–Michigan–Brookhaven (detector)|IMB]] detected 11 and 8&amp;nbsp;antineutrinos ([[lepton number]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1) of thermal origin,&lt;ref name=Mannbook /&gt; respectively, while the scintillator-based [[Baksan Neutrino Observatory|Baksan]] detector found 5&amp;nbsp;neutrinos ([[lepton number]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1) of either thermal or electron-capture origin, in a burst less than 13&amp;nbsp;seconds long. The neutrino signal from the supernova arrived at earth several hours before the arrival of the first electromagnetic radiation, as expected from the evident fact that the latter emerges along with the shock wave. The exceptionally feeble interaction with normal matter allowed the neutrinos to pass through the churning mass of the exploding star, while the electromagnetic photons were slowed.

Because neutrinos interact so little with matter, it is thought that a supernova's neutrino emissions carry information about the innermost regions of the explosion. Much of the ''visible'' light comes from the decay of radioactive elements produced by the supernova shock wave, and even light from the explosion itself is scattered by dense and turbulent gases, and thus delayed. The neutrino burst is expected to reach Earth before any electromagnetic waves, including visible light, gamma rays, or radio waves. The exact time delay of the electromagnetic waves' arrivals depends on the velocity of the shock wave and on the thickness of the outer layer of the star. For a Type&amp;nbsp;II supernova, astronomers expect the neutrino flood to be released seconds after the stellar core collapse, while the first electromagnetic signal may emerge hours later, after the explosion shock wave has had time to reach the surface of the star. The [[Supernova Early Warning System]] project uses a network of neutrino detectors to monitor the sky for candidate supernova events; the neutrino signal will provide a useful advance warning of a star exploding in the [[Milky Way]].

Although neutrinos pass through the outer gases of a supernova without scattering, they provide information about the deeper supernova core with evidence that here, even neutrinos scatter to a significant extent. In a supernova core the densities are those of a neutron star (which is expected to be formed in this type of supernova),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marciabartusiak.com/uploads/8/5/8/9/8589314/sanduleak.pdf |title=The Short Life and Violent Death of Sanduleak-69 |author=Marcia Bartusiak }}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming large enough to influence the duration of the neutrino signal by delaying some neutrinos. The 13&amp;nbsp;second-long neutrino signal from SN&amp;nbsp;1987A lasted far longer than it would take for unimpeded neutrinos to cross through the neutrino-generating core of a supernova, expected to be only 3200 kilometers in diameter for SN&amp;nbsp;1987A.

The number of neutrinos counted was also consistent with a total neutrino energy of {{val|2.2|e=46|u=joules}}, which was estimated to be nearly all of the total energy of the supernova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=0810.0466 |title=Improved analysis of SN1987A antineutrino events |journal=Astroparticle Physics |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=163–176 |last1=Pagliaroli |first1=G. |last2=Vissani |first2=F. |last3=Costantini |first3=M.

For an average supernova, approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;+57&lt;/sup&gt; (an [[octodecillion]]) neutrinos are released, but the actual number detected at a terrestrial detector &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; will be far smaller, at the level of

&lt;math&gt;N \sim 10^4 \left(\frac{M}{25 \mathrm{kton}}\right) \left(\frac{d}{10 \mathrm{kpc}}\right)^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the detector (with e.g. [[Super Kamiokande]] having a mass of 50&amp;nbsp;kton) and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the supernova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beacom |first1=J.F. |last2=Vogel |first2=P. |title=Can a supernova be located by its neutrinos? |journal=Phys.

===Supernova remnants===
The energy of supernova neutrinos ranges from a few to several tens of MeV. The sites where [[cosmic rays]] are accelerated are expected to produce neutrinos that are at least one million times more energetic, produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova explosions: the [[supernova remnant]]s. The origin of the cosmic rays was attributed to supernovas by [[Walter Baade]] and [[Fritz Zwicky]]; this hypothesis was refined by [[Vitaly L. Ginzburg]] and Sergei I. Syrovatsky who attributed the origin to supernova remnants, and supported their claim by the crucial remark, that the cosmic ray losses of the Milky Way is compensated, if the efficiency of acceleration in supernova remnants is about 10 percent. Ginzburg and Syrovatskii's hypothesis is supported by the specific mechanism of "shock wave acceleration" happening in supernova remnants, which is consistent with the original theoretical picture drawn by [[Enrico Fermi]], and is receiving support from observational data. The very-high-energy neutrinos are still to be seen, but this branch of neutrino astronomy is just in its infancy. The main existing or forthcoming experiments that aim at observing very-high-energy neutrinos from our galaxy are [[Baikal Deep Underwater Neutrino Telescope|Baikal]], [[Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array|AMANDA]], [[IceCube]], [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]], [[Neutrino Mediterranean Observatory|NEMO]] and [[Nestor Project|Nestor]]. Related information is provided by [[ultra-high-energy gamma ray|very-high-energy gamma ray]] observatories, such as [[VERITAS]], [[High Energy Stereoscopic System|HESS]] and [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]]. Indeed, the collisions of cosmic rays are supposed to produce charged pions, whose decay give the neutrinos, and also neutral pions, whose decay give gamma rays: the environment of a supernova remnant is transparent to both types of radiation.

Still-higher-energy neutrinos, resulting from the interactions of extragalactic cosmic rays, could be observed with the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] or with the dedicated experiment named [[ANtarctic Impulse Transient Antenna|ANITA]].

===Big Bang===
{{Main|Cosmic neutrino background}}
It is thought that, just like the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] left over from the [[Big Bang]], there is a background of low-energy neutrinos in our Universe. In the 1980s it was proposed that these may be the explanation for the [[dark matter]] thought to exist in the universe. Neutrinos have one important advantage over most other dark matter candidates: it is known that they exist. This idea also has serious problems.

From particle experiments, it is known that neutrinos are very light. This means that they easily move at speeds close to the [[speed of light]]. For this reason, dark matter made from neutrinos is termed "[[hot dark matter]]". The problem is that being fast moving, the neutrinos would tend to have spread out evenly in the [[universe]] before cosmological expansion made them cold enough to congregate in clumps. This would cause the part of [[dark matter]] made of neutrinos to be smeared out and unable to cause the large [[galaxy|galactic]] structures that we see.

These same galaxies and [[galaxy groups and clusters|groups of galaxies]] appear to be surrounded by dark matter that is not fast enough to escape from those galaxies. Presumably this matter provided the gravitational nucleus for [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation]]. This implies that neutrinos cannot make up a significant part of the total amount of dark matter.

From cosmological arguments, relic background neutrinos are estimated to have density of 56 of each type per cubic centimeter and temperature {{val|1.9|u=K}} ({{val|1.7|e=-4|u=eV}}) if they are massless, much colder if their mass exceeds {{val|0.001|u=eV}}. Although their density is quite high, they have not yet been observed in the laboratory, as their energy is below thresholds of most detection methods, and due to extremely low neutrino interaction cross-sections at sub-eV energies. In contrast, [[boron-8]] solar neutrinos—which are emitted with a higher energy—have been detected definitively despite having a space density that is lower than that of relic neutrinos by some 6 orders of magnitude.

==Detection==
{{Main|Neutrino detector}}

Neutrinos cannot be detected directly, because they do not ionize the materials they are passing through (they do not carry electric charge and other proposed effects, like the MSW effect, do not produce traceable radiation). A unique reaction to identify antineutrinos, sometimes referred to as [[inverse beta decay]], as applied by Reines and Cowan (see below), requires a very large detector to detect a significant number of neutrinos. All detection methods require the neutrinos to carry a minimum threshold energy. So far, there is no detection method for low-energy neutrinos, in the sense that potential neutrino interactions (for example by the MSW effect) cannot be uniquely distinguished from other causes. Neutrino detectors are often built underground to isolate the detector from [[cosmic ray]]s and other background radiation.

Antineutrinos were first detected in the 1950s near a nuclear reactor. [[Frederick Reines|Reines]] and [[Clyde Cowan|Cowan]] used two targets containing a solution of [[cadmium chloride]] in water. Two scintillation detectors were placed next to the cadmium targets. Antineutrinos with an energy above the threshold of {{val|1.8|u=MeV}} caused charged current interactions with the protons in the water, producing positrons and neutrons. This is very much like {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}} decay, where energy is used to convert a proton into a neutron, a [[positron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Positron}}) and an [[electron neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron Neutrino}}) is emitted:

From known {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}} decay:

: Energy + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}

In the Cowan and Reines experiment, instead of an outgoing neutrino, you have an incoming antineutrino ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron Antineutrino}}) from a nuclear reactor:

: Energy (&gt;{{val|1.8|u=MeV}}) + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}}

The resulting positron annihilation with electrons in the detector material created photons with an energy of about {{val|0.5|u=MeV}}. Pairs of photons in coincidence could be detected by the two scintillation detectors above and below the target. The neutrons were captured by cadmium nuclei resulting in gamma rays of about {{val|8|u=MeV}} that were detected a few microseconds after the photons from a positron annihilation event.

Since then, various detection methods have been used. [[Super Kamiokande]] is a large volume of water surrounded by [[photomultiplier tube]]s that watch for the [[Cherenkov radiation]] emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an [[electron]] or [[muon]] in the water. The [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] is similar, but uses [[heavy water]] as the detecting medium, which uses the same effects, but also allows the additional reaction any-flavor neutrino photo-dissociation of deuterium, resulting in a free neutron which is then detected from gamma radiation after chlorine-capture. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of [[chlorine]] or [[gallium]] which are periodically checked for excesses of [[argon]] or [[germanium]], respectively, which are created by electron-neutrinos interacting with the original substance. [[MINOS]] used a solid plastic [[scintillator]] coupled to photomultiplier tubes, while [[Borexino]] uses a liquid [[pseudocumene]] scintillator also watched by photomultiplier tubes and the [[NOνA]] detector uses liquid scintillator watched by [[avalanche photodiode]]s. The [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory]] uses {{val|1|u=km3}} of the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] near the [[south pole]] with photomultiplier tubes distributed throughout the volume.
The University of Liverpool ND280 detector employs the novel use of gadolinium encased light detectors in a temperature controlled magnetic field capturing double light pulse events. The T2K experiment developed the technology and practical experiments were successful in both Japan and at Wylfa power station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McCauley, N. |author2=Wang, H. |author3=Christodoulou, G. |author4=Jamieson, B. |author5=Lasorak, P. |date=September 2017 |title= Selection of electron (anti-)neutrinos at the T2K near detector ND280 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319925856 |journal=[[Journal of Physics]] |series=Conference Series |volume=888 |issue=1 |pages=012218 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific interest==
Neutrinos' low mass and neutral charge mean they interact exceedingly weakly with other particles and fields. This feature of weak interaction interests scientists because it means neutrinos can be used to probe environments that other radiation (such as light or radio waves) cannot penetrate.

Using neutrinos as a probe was first proposed in the mid-20th century as a way to detect conditions at the core of the Sun. The solar core cannot be imaged directly because electromagnetic radiation (such as light) is diffused by the great amount and density of matter surrounding the core. On the other hand, neutrinos pass through the Sun with few interactions. Whereas photons emitted from the solar core may require 40,000 years to diffuse to the outer layers of the Sun, neutrinos generated in stellar fusion reactions at the core cross this distance practically unimpeded at nearly the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;

Neutrinos are also useful for probing astrophysical sources beyond the Solar System because they are the only known particles that are not significantly [[attenuation|attenuated]] by their travel through the interstellar medium. Optical photons can be obscured or diffused by dust, gas, and background radiation. High-energy [[cosmic rays]], in the form of swift protons and atomic nuclei, are unable to travel more than about 100 [[megaparsec]]s due to the [[Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit]] (GZK cutoff). Neutrinos, in contrast, can travel even greater distances barely attenuated.

The galactic core of the [[Milky Way]] is fully obscured by dense gas and numerous bright objects. Neutrinos produced in the galactic core might be measurable by Earth-based [[neutrino telescope]]s.&lt;ref name=Close2012 /&gt;

Another important use of the neutrino is in the observation of [[supernova]]e, the explosions that end the lives of highly massive stars. The core collapse phase of a supernova is an extremely dense and energetic event. It is so dense that no known particles are able to escape the advancing core front except for neutrinos. Consequently, supernovae are known to release approximately 99% of their radiant energy in a short (10-second) burst of neutrinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://focus.aps.org/story/v24/st4 |title=Physics – Supernova Starting Gun: Neutrinos |journal=Physics |volume=24 |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2012-04-05|last1=Minkel |first1=J. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; These neutrinos are a very useful probe for core collapse studies.

The rest mass of the neutrino is an important test of cosmological and astrophysical theories (see ''[[Dark matter]]''). The neutrino's significance in probing cosmological phenomena is as great as any other method, and is thus a major focus of study in astrophysical communities.&lt;ref name="SciAm-Gelmini"&gt;{{cite magazine |author1=Gelmini, G.B. |author2=Kusenko, A. |author2-link=Alexander Kusenko |author3=Weiler, T.J. |date=May 2010 |title=Through Neutrino Eyes |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=through-neutrino-eyes |magazine=[[Scientific American]] |volume=302 |issue=5 |pages=38–45 |bibcode=2010SciAm.302e..38G |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0510-38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of neutrinos is important in [[particle physics]] because neutrinos typically have the lowest mass, and hence are examples of the lowest-energy particles theorized in extensions of the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics.

In November 2012, American scientists used a particle accelerator to send a coherent neutrino message through 780 feet of rock. This marks the first use of neutrinos for communication, and future research may permit binary neutrino messages to be sent immense distances through even the densest materials, such as the Earth's core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stancil |first1=D.

'''The Nigeria gully erosion crisis''' has been ongoing since before 1980, and affects communities large and small.  It is an [[ecological crisis|ecological]], [[environmental disaster|environmental]], [[economic collapse|economic]], and [[humanitarian crisis|humanitarian]] disaster resulting in [[land degradation]], loss of lives, and properties worth millions of dollars. The estimated number of [[gullies]] in the country is at 3,000. Gullies and areas exposed to erosion in [[Southeastern Nigeria]] tripled from about 1.33% (1,021 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in 1976 to about 3.7% (2,820 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in 2006 making the region the most affected region in the country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=The World|date=2012-04-12|title=Nigeria - Erosion and Watershed Management Project|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/728741468334143813/Nigeria-Erosion-and-Watershed-Management-Project|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

Gullies are majorly caused by [[surface runoff]], the [[erosion]] occurs, notably, in [[gully|gullies]], which grow wider and deeper with each rainfall.  Many of the gullies have become [[ravine]]s, which can be dozens or hundreds of feet deep. Some natural processes can induce gullies, such as high amounts of rainfall, poor [[Infiltration (hydrology)|soil infiltration]] and unfavorable [[Drainage basin|catchment shape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/land-and-soil/soil-degradation/gully-erosion|title=Gully erosion|last=author|website=NSW Environment &amp; Heritage|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in Nigeria, the causes of gully formation can be largely attributed to human activities such as:
*[[File:Poorly terminated drain.jpg|thumb|Poorly terminated drain, a major cause of gully erosion]]Poor [[Highway engineering|road design]], [[construction]] and abrupt termination of [[Drainage|drains]]: When drains are not properly terminated, the flow in them usually with high [[pressure]] will disperse the earth below causing gullies rather than flow to lower catchment areas.
* Poor [[waste management]] practices: Poor waste management practices such as dumping of [[Waste|refuse]] into drains and [[Waterway|waterways]] prevent the proper flow of water. This practice results in [[Flood|flooding]] and if unchecked, it can lead to erosion of the top layer of the soil. 
* Unsustainable [[land use]] practices: Practices such as improper [[sand mining]] strips away the top soil and tilling process associated with [[Agriculture|crop cultivation]] loosens the top soil, creating paths for runoff. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Though concentrated in several towns and states in the Southeastern part of the country, the [[crisis]] affects all Nigerians indirectly. Homes and structures routinely collapse, as the gullies expand with each [[wet season|rainy season]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voanews.com/content/erosion-threatens-nigeria-villages/1680362.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Unchecked, the phenomenon will eventually transform the region into a [[badlands|badland]].

==Impact==
Impacts caused by this environmental menace includes:
* loss of [[infrastructure]] including roads, houses, and other real estate.
* loss of agricultural land and [[vegetation]].
* Increased [[siltation]] in rivers leading to flooding.
* Increased [[sedimentation]] in waterways.

==Major interverntions==

In 2010, President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan made a request to the [[World Bank]] Nigeria office for assistance in addressing the challenges of gully erosion, emerging Land degradation and environmental insecurity in the country. This request resulted in the formation of the [[Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project]] (NEWMAP), an eight (8) year multi-sectoral project aimed at addressing gully erosion in the Southern Nigeria and land degradation in the Northern Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newmap.gov.ng/about-us/|title=About Us – NEWMAP|website=newmap.gov.ng|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before this intervention, several interventions failed to address the challenge of gully erosion mainly because of inefficiencies in designing proper structures and lack of commitment by the locals to take action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

However, in some areas like Madona gully site, Awhum community Enugu State, and Okudu community Imo State, some sustainable interventions base on good practices were employed. These interventions addressed the menace of gully erosion in those areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Pipe recovery''' is a specific [[Wireline (cabling)|wireline]] operation used in the [[Petroleum industry|oil and gas industry]], when the [[drill string]] becomes stuck downhole. Stuck pipe prevents the [[drill rig]] from continuing operations. This results in costly downtime, ranging anywhere from $10,000-1,000,000 per day of downtime, therefore it is critical to resolve the problem as quickly as possible. Pipe recovery is the process by which the location of the stuck pipe is identified, and the free pipe is separated from the stuck pipe. This allows fishing tools to subsequently be run down hole to latch onto and remove the stuck pipe.

== Causes of Stuck Pipe==
[[File:Pipe_Recovery,_Coil_Tubing.jpg|thumb|right|Wireline truck rigged up to a coil tubing unit in order to cut the coil tubing.]]
;Differentially Stuck Pipe
The geological formation downhole occasionally has a significantly lower pressure than the [[drilling fluid]] being used. When the pipe string comes into contact with the exposed formation the difference in pressure will cause the pipe to be sucked against the formation. If the rig is able to circulate drilling fluid back to the surface that is often a good indication of differentially stuck pipe. One technique for freeing the stuck pipe, or avoiding the issue to begin with, is to rotate the pipe string while pulling out of the hole.
;Key Seated Stuck Pipe
Key seating occurs when the drill string becomes off-centered in the wellbore, and the pipe collars become caught on a deviation in the wellbore. If the rig is able to move the drill string freely downhole, but every time the drill string is pulled upward it becomes stuck at the same point, then it is likely that the pipe is caught in a key seat.
;Cave-in Stuck Pipe
An unstable formation can result in a cave in. The collapse of the formation can pin the pipe inside the wellbore preventing its movement.
;Mechanically Stuck Pipe:
This can be the result of objects, i.e. slips or pipe wrenches, being dropped down the hole lodging against the [[Bottom hole assembly|BHA.]]
[[File:Bent Tubing.jpg|thumb|X220px|Bent 2 7/8" Tubing]]
;Communication between Wells
In areas with a high concentration of oil wells, it is not unusual for wells to communicate through the formation for distances of up to mile. During a fracing operation thousands of gallons of fluid and sand are pumped down one well to open up the formation surrounding that wellbore. Often large amounts of that proppant and fluid will travel through the formation and into a nearby well. This sand can lodge on top of a packer or coil tubing in the well sticking the pipe. 
;Tubing Stuck in Production Wells:
Tubing in production wells is often exposed to a number of highly corrosive chemicals, such as [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.]]&lt;ref&gt;EPA Article on H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S Corrosion [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/200048ZZ.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1991%20Thru%201994&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C91THRU94%5CTXT%5C00000001%5C200048ZZ.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1]&lt;/ref&gt; This corrosion can deteriorate the tubing to the point that it separates from the [[wellhead]] causing the tubing to fall downhole. The impact of several thousands of pounds of tubing on the bottom of the hole can severely damage the tubing, causing kinks or a corkscrew effect in the tubing, making it difficult to retrieve out of the hole. Sand coming in through holes in the casing or a malfunctioning production packer can also cause tubing to become stuck in production wells.

== Free point ==
{{howto|date=July 2018}}
The term free point is used to describe the delineating point between the stuck pipe and the free pipe in a pipe string. Every joint of pipe above the free point is free, meaning it can rotate freely and be moved in and out of the hole, provided it was not attached to the remaining joints of stuck pipe below the free point. A good way to visualize this is to hold a piece of string with your left hand. With your right hand grab the bottom third of that string. The 2/3rds of the string above your right hand would be considered free, since you can move the string however you may like. The section of string inside and below your right hand is stuck, since no matter what you do to the free string it will not affect the string in or below your right hand.

;Pipe Stretch Free Point Estimate:
The pipe stretch free point estimate is a good starting point for identifying the free point.
#Pull the drillstring to the pipe's neutral weight, which is the combined weight of [[Traveling block|blocks]] and the weight of the drill string and make a mark(X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(in) at the top of the rotary table.
#Identify the recommended overpull by multiplying 2208.5 by pipe weight/ft. Pull the calculated overpull(F) (Not to exceed the yield strength of the pipe) causing the free portion of the pipe to stretch to a new position (X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)‍(in).
#Use the following equation to calculate the free point from the rig floor:

:::{{font|size=110%|text=L&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;735,294(X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)W&lt;sub&gt;dp&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;F}}

::where L&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; = depth of stuck point (ft), (X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)= The stretch of the pipe from the reference point (in.), W&lt;sub&gt;dp&lt;/sub&gt; = weight of drill pipe (lbs/ft), and F = the additional pull required (lbs.) It is important to note that the stretch test does not take into account drill collars, heavyweight drill pipe, and/or wellbore deviation.&lt;ref&gt;Pg. 417 Petroleum Engineering Handbook for the Practicing Engineer, Volume 2 by M.A. Mian [https://books.google.com/books?id=SX6PTJq5I04C&amp;pg=PA417&amp;lpg=PA417&amp;dq=pipe+stretch++free+point&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xh589WTsZx&amp;sig=5zFxSOmaN_8yzxohK7uvtNIxCts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6v-TUO6vIuOA2wWQvoGYAg&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pipe%20stretch%20%20free%20point&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tools are operated using a [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]] truck.

;Traditional Free Point Tools:
[[File:Freepoint tool.pdf|300x500px|thumbnail|Applied Electronic Systems Traditional [[Free point]] Tool]] The traditional freepoint tool is an electromechanical tool designed to measure the amount of torque or stretch of a given length of tubing, drill pipe, or casing. The traditional freepoint tool uses either bow springs or magnets to anchor itself inside the pipe. After obtaining an estimate of the free point by using the pipe stretch estimate technique, the traditional freepoint tool is run in the hole to 1000 feet above the estimated stuck point. The tool is anchored in place. Stretch and or torque is then applied to the pipe. This allows the pipe recovery engineer to obtain a baseline reading of the free pipe. This will give him a starting point to compare his later freepoint readings to. The tool is then run roughly 500 feet past the estimated stuck point. Stretch and torque are applied, and readings are taken. If the tool indicates that the pipe is stuck at that point the tool is pulled uphole and readings are taken again. By applying the bracketing technique, the pipe recovery engineer is quickly able to identify the exact point that the pipe is free.&lt;ref&gt;Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)Journal Paper "An Overview of Free Point Tools," DEC 1998 [http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/app/Preview.do?paperNumber=00016154&amp;societyCode=SPE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ge-energy.com/products_and_services/products/wireline_systems/pipe_recovery_technology_free_point_tool.jsp GE Sondex Freepoint Indicator]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Halliburton Free Point Tool
The Halliburton Freepoint Tool is based around the magnetorestrictive property of steel. This principle states that when torque or stretch is applied to free pipe, the magnetization will change. Stuck pipe will have no change in magnetization. There is a magnet on the bottom of the tool that creates a small magnetic field. There are four co-planar orthogonal multi-axis high sensitivity magnetometers located above the magnet. The magnetometers measure the change in the magnetization of the pipe. The pipe is set at neutral weight, then the tool is run downhole logging the entire pipe string. Once it is at the bottom of the string, torque or stretch is applied to the pipe. The tool is then pulled uphole logging the entire string. The tool will detect differences in the magnetization of the pipe, thereby indicating free and stuck sections of pipe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Offshore Technology Conference|Offshore Technologies Conference (OTC)]] Conference Paper (2010) [http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=OTC-20933-MS ''Game Changing Technology Developments for Safe and Cost Effective Determination of Free Point in Horizontal and Vertical Wells'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SPE Case Histories of a New Wireline Logging Tool for Determination of Free Point in Support of Drilling and Pipe Recovery Operations [http://www.spe.org/events/lacpec/2009/en/technical/documents/119907_CalvinKessler.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Backing off pipe ==
Backing off pipe, is an industry term which means unscrewing the pipe at a desired depth downhole.

;Inside Back Off or String Shot:
Once the free point of a stuck pipe string is determined, the stringshot back-off service can be used to remove the free portion from the well. The string-shot is a metal rod wrapped in explosive primer cord. The back-off procedure applies left-hand torque to the stuck pipe string. The CCL is used to help position the string shot at the predetermined pipe joint, and then the string shot is detonated.&lt;ref&gt;http://wirelinehq.com/wireline-basics/wireline-casing-collar-locator/&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion produces a similar effect as an intense hammer blow and allows the joint to be unscrewed at the proper connection. Several factors such as pipe size, weight and condition, back-off depth, mud or borehole fluid weight and well temperature are carefully considered when making up the proper string-shot assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://c14503045.r45.cf2.rackcdn.com/v1/82c9d753f1526807964d1205f80114b3/30216-pipe-recovery_-brochure.pdf Baker Hughes Pipe Recovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Manual Back Off:
Manual back offs are the least preferred technique for removing free pipe from the hole since there is very little control. When performing a manual back off you take the desired back off depth(ft.) and multiply it by the weight of one foot of pipe. This will give you a rough estimate of the neutral weight of the pipe at the desired depth. By setting the pipe at neutral weight at the desired depth you are reducing any tension on the threads at the desired depth, thereby increasing your odds of the pipe unscrewing there. The driller will pickup the string to the back off neutral weight, and then left hand torque is applied until the pipe unscrews. There is no guarantee that the pipe will unscrew at the desired point making the manual back off the last resort for backing off pipe.

== Tools for cutting pipe ==
;Chemical Cutter
Chemical cutters use a propellant to generate pressure forcing the chemical, usually Bromine Trifluoride, through a catalyst. The resulting chemical reaction is expelled through the severing head of the cutter at a high temperature and pressure, which cuts the wall of the tubing. The resulting cut is a very smooth cut that does not require any dressing before further pipe recovery operations can take place.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;SPE, "Effect of Well Variables on the Performance of Chemical, Jet, and RCT Tubing Cutters",SEP 2009 [http://www.spe.org/ejournals/jsp/journalapp.jsp?pageType=Preview&amp;jid=EDC&amp;mid=SPE-110776-PA]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jet Cutter, Coiled Tubing.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|1.375in OD Jet Cutter used for cutting coiled tubing.]]

;Jet Cutters
Jet cutters use a circular-shaped charge to produce the cutting action. Jet cutters are capable of severing pipe despite significant downhole pressure. This makes them an ideal choice for extremely deep wells, greater than 20,000 feet deep. They typically leave a flare on the severed pipe string. This flare must be removed, typically by using a mill, before further fishing operations can take place.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adam"&gt;SPE Conference Paper, "Drill Pipe Cutting At Ultra High Pressure: A Proven Capability For Stuck Pipe Hazards", 1-3 MAR 2011 [http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=SPE-139511-MS&amp;soc=SPE]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RCT Cut 2.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright=.6|2 3/8in tubing cut with a RCT]]

;Radial Cutting Torch(RCT)
Radial cutting torches use a mixture of powdered metals contained inside the torch body, those metals burn at a very high temperature on ignition by the gas generator. The resultant molten plasma is then ejected through the radial graphic ceramic nozzle and onto the target tubing. The result is a clean, non flared cut. The highly energized plasma is capable of overcoming nearly any wellbore condition, and has a cutting success rate of 77%.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; The RCT does not contain explosives; this greatly reduces transportation costs and logistical problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcroiltools.com/PRODUCTS/RadialCuttingTorch/tabid/83/Default.aspx MCR Oil Tools-RCT]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Drill Collar Severing Tool (DCST)
The Drill Collar Severing Tool is often used to separate heavy weight drill pipe or drill collars. The DCST contains an explosive charge at either end of the tool; both charges are detonated simultaneously. The explosive shock waves meet in the center of the tool and combine to produce a very high energy wave capable of cutting through the thickest of pipe. The severed pipe is typically split and deformed, requiring milling.&lt;ref name="adam"/&gt;

'''Nunca Máis''' ({{lang-gl|'Never Again'}}, {{lang-es|Nunca Más}}) is the name and slogan of a popular movement in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (Spain) formed in response to the [[Prestige oil spill|Prestige ship environmental disaster]] in 2002.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The movement's banner is based on the [[Flag of Galicia|Galician flag]], but with a blue diagonal on a black field, rather than a blue diagonal on a white field. The movement describes itself as representing a broad swathe of civil society.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

''Nunca Máis'' organized a number of demonstrations to ensure the official recognition of Galicia as a catastrophe zone and the immediate resource base to repair the economic, social, environmental and health problems resulting from the disaster. It also called for the set in of motion of disaster prevention systems, in order to avoid disasters like this from occurring. The demonstrations were attended by thousands on successive days.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

On August 11, 2006, the ''Plataforma Nunca Máis'' announced their reactivation to fight against the wave of forest fires that had been started throughout Galicia. A number of rallies in the Galician capital, [[Santiago de Compostela]], were organised, with large numbers attending.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

''Nunca Máis'' acts as a co-ordinator of other associations, namely cultural, civic and ecologist associations. In this fashion, ''Nunca Máis'' could be considered as of being made up of a series of other associations, despite having its own directive board.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

'''Pop''Offsets''''' was a web-based, carbon offsetting project of [[Population Matters]], (formerly known as the Optimum Population Trust). In 2018 the project was superseded by [https://www.populationmatters.org/empower-to-plan/ Empower to Plan], a crowdfunding project for supporting family planning providers.

== Population Matters ==

Founded in 1991, [[Population Matters]] is a leading [[UK]] campaigning charity concerned with the effects of current [[world population]] growth on the [[natural environment]], particularly regarding [[climate change]]. It advocates for population stabilisation through improved access to rights-based family planning schemes. Population Matters commissioned a research paper entitled ""“Fewer Emitters, Lower Emissions, Less Cost”"" which indicates that addressing unmet needs for family planning is the most cost-effective way of reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and climate change – possibly less than one third of the cost of other technological fixes – without any environmental downsides. They estimate that every $7 (£4) spent on family planning saves one tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A similar reduction would require a $13 (£8) investment in tree planting, $24 (£15) in wind power, $41 (£31) in solar energy and $92 (£56) in hybrid vehicle technology.

Launched on 3 December 2009, just days before the [[Copenhagen Climate Summit]], PopOffsets was the first and only carbon offsetting scheme worldwide investing its funds in rights-based family planning schemes, health programs, relationship and sex education. Population Matters considers that investing in family planning services is vital for environmental sustainability, with particular regards to women who have little or no access to these services. Every year there are 80 million unintended pregnancies in the world, which could be averted by making sex education and family planning services accessible to everyone. Details of PopOffsets were circulated to every British MP.

== How it worked ==

The PopOffsets web-project offered a step-by-step guide enabling contributors to make online donations to Population Matters, in order to support rights-based family planning schemes. Contributors could calculate their estimated annual amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in their country of residence, using a “CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; calculator”. The calculator divided the total amount of the chosen country’s CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by the number of its citizens. The contributor could then decide to offset his/her annual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions or to opt for a “one-off” amount, by determining the exact amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that he/she is wishing to offset.

== Funding ==

The funds gathered from online donations were distributed between rights-based family planning schemes, contraceptive services and supplies, sex and relationship education and health programs. Population Matters aims to use the majority of its funds to meet the needs of over 200 million women worldwide who do not have access to family planning services.

== Media coverage ==

The launch of the Pop Offset project on 3rd December 2009 received international media coverage from both print and broadcast media outlets, including in [[The Guardian]], [[The Times]], [[The Sunday Express]], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]], [[Reuters]], [[BBC]] and [[Channel 4]].

== Criticism ==

The PopOffsets program received some [https://makewealthhistory.org/2009/12/03/population-offsets-a-marriage-of-misconceptions/ criticism] mostly on the grounds that populations of developing countries, although bearing high birth rates, are not responsible for creating high levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Population Matters, however, stressed that reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; outputs by the wealthiest is a vital component of any strategy. Note that the replacement Empower to Plan scheme has no carbon offsetting component.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2531">'''Power pooling''' is used to balance [[electrical load]] over a larger network ([[electrical grid]]) than a single utility.  It is a mechanism for interchange of power between two and more utilities which provide or generate [[electricity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Sivanagaraju, S.  |author2=Sreenivasan, G. |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Load frequency Control - II|title=Power System Operation And Control|location=Chennai, India|publisher=Pearson|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9GkhHYorvDAC&amp;pg=PA313 313&amp;ndash;]|isbn=978-81-317-2662-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For exchange of power between two utilities there is an interchange agreement which is signed by them, but signing up an interchange agreement between each pair of utilities within a system can be a difficult task where several large utilities are interconnected. Thus, it is more advantageous to form a power pool with a single agreement that all join. That agreement provides established terms and conditions for pool members and is generally more complex than a bilateral agreement.

In one model, the power pool, formed by the utilities, has a control dispatch office from where the pool is administered. All the tasks regarding interchange of power and the settlement of disputes are assigned to the pool administrator.

The formation of power pools provide the following potential advantages:
#Decrease in operating costs
#Saving in reserve capacity requirements
#Help from pool in unit commitment
#Minimization of costs of maintenance scheduling
#More reliable operation

The formation of a power pool is associated with a number of problems and constraints. These include:
#Pool agreement may be very complex
#Costs associated with establishing central dispatch office and the needed communication and computational facilities
#The opposition of pool members to give up their rights to engage in independent transactions outside the pool.
#The complexity towards dealing with regulatory authorities, if pool operates in more than one state.
#The effort by each member of the pool to maximize its savings.

Power pooling is very important for extending energy control over a large area served by multiple utilities.

[[File:Protective Relays Hydroelectric Station.JPG|thumb|right|Electromechanical protective relays at a [[hydroelectric]] generating plant. The relays are in round glass cases. The rectangular devices are test connection blocks, used for testing and isolation of instrument transformer circuits.]]
In [[electrical engineering]], a '''protective relay''' is a [[relay]] device designed to trip a [[circuit breaker]] when a fault is detected.{{r|YGP|page1= 4}} The first protective relays were electromagnetic devices, relying on coils operating on moving parts to provide detection of abnormal operating conditions such as over-current, over-voltage, reverse [[electric power|power]] flow, over-frequency, and under-frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://library.e.abb.com/public/c1256d32004634bac1256e19006fd705/PAPER_2001_08_en_100_Years_of_Relay_Protection__the_Swedish_ABB_Relay_History.pdf|title= 100 years of relay protection, the Swedish ABB relay history|date= |accessdate= 30 December 2015|website= |publisher= ABB|last= Lundqvist|first= Bertil}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Microprocessor-based digital protection relays now emulate the original devices, as well as providing types of protection and supervision impractical with electromechanical relays. Electromechanical relays provide only rudimentary indication of the location and origin of a fault. &lt;ref name="Pacworld"&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://www.pacw.org/issue/september_2014_issue/history/protection_history/complete_article/1.html|title= Protection History|last= Schossig|first= Walter|date= September 2014|magazine= Pacworld|doi= |pmid= |access-date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases a single microprocessor relay provides functions that would take two or more electromechanical devices. By combining several functions in one case, numerical relays also save capital cost and maintenance cost over electromechanical relays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Microprocessor-Based Transmission Line Relay Applications |last=Mooney |first=Joe |publisher=Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc. |date=March 25–28, 1996 |conference=American Public Power Association's Engineering &amp; Operations Workshop |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |url=https://www.selinc.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2403 |page=1}}&lt;!--Archived at http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.69.7874--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to their very long life span, tens of thousands of these "silent sentinels"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title= Silent Sentinels|publisher= Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company|year= 1940|isbn= |location= Newark, New Jersey|pages= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; are still protecting transmission lines and electrical apparatus all over the world. Important transmission lines and generators have cubicles dedicated to protection, with many individual electromechanical devices, or one or two microprocessor relays.

The theory and application of these protective devices is an important part of the education of a [[power engineering|power engineer]] who specializes in [[power system protection]]. The need to act quickly to protect circuits and equipment as well as the general public often requires protective relays to respond and trip a breaker within a few thousandths of a second. In some instances these clearance times are prescribed in legislation or operating rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= AEMC - Current Rules|url= http://www.aemc.gov.au/energy-rules/national-electricity-rules/current-rules|website= www.aemc.gov.au|accessdate= 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A maintenance or testing program is used to determine the performance and availability of protection systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Protection System Maintenance - A Technical Reference|url= http://www.nerc.com/docs/pc/spctf/Relay_Maintenance_Tech_Ref_approved_by_PC.pdf|website= www.nerc.com|pages= 1|accessdate= 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the end application and applicable legislation, various standards such as ANSI C37.90, IEC255-4, IEC60255-3, and IAC govern the response time of the relay to the fault conditions that may occur.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Operation principles==
Electromechanical protective relays operate by either [[magnetic attraction]], or [[electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]].{{r|Mason|page1=14}} Unlike switching type electromechanical [[relay]]s with fixed and usually ill-defined operating voltage thresholds and operating times, protective relays have well-established, selectable, and adjustable time and current (or other operating parameter) operating characteristics. Protection relays may use arrays of induction disks, shaded-pole,{{r|Mason|page1=25}} magnets, operating and restraint coils, solenoid-type operators, telephone-relay contacts,{{what|date=October 2016}} and phase-shifting networks.

Protective relays can also be classified by the type of measurement they make.{{r|PRAG|page1=92}} A protective relay may respond to the magnitude of a quantity such as voltage or current. Induction relays can respond to the product of two quantities in two field coils, which could for example represent the power in a circuit.

"It is not practical to make a relay that develops a torque equal to the quotient of two a.c. quantities. This, however is not important; the only significant condition for a relay is its setting and the setting can be made to correspond to a ratio regardless of the component values over a wide range."{{r|PRAG|page1=92}}

Several operating coils can be used to provide "bias" to the relay, allowing the sensitivity of response in one circuit to be controlled by another. Various combinations of "operate torque" and "restraint torque" can be produced in the relay.

By use of a permanent magnet in the [[magnetic circuit]], a relay can be made to respond to current in one direction differently from in another. Such [[relay#Polarized relay|polarized relays]] are used on direct-current circuits to detect, for example, reverse current into a generator. These relays can be made bistable, maintaining a contact closed with no coil current and requiring reverse current to reset. For AC circuits, the principle is extended with a polarizing winding connected to a reference voltage source.

Lightweight contacts make for sensitive relays that operate quickly, but small contacts can't carry or break heavy currents. Often the measuring relay will trigger auxiliary telephone-type armature relays.

In a large installation of electromechanical relays, it would be difficult to determine which device originated the signal that tripped the circuit. This information is useful to operating personnel to determine the likely cause of the fault and to prevent its re-occurrence. Relays may be fitted with a "target" or "flag" unit, which is released when the relay operates, to display a distinctive colored signal when the relay has tripped.&lt;ref name=GEC97/&gt;

==Types according to construction==

===Electromechanical===
Electromechanical relays can be classified into several different types as follows:
{|
|-
| valign="top" |
*attracted armature
*moving coil
| valign="top" |
*induction
*motor operated
| valign="top" |
*mechanical
*thermal
|}
"Armature"-type relays have a pivoted lever supported on a hinge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Relay Design and Construction|url= https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-6459-7_2|publisher= Springer US|date= 1968-01-01|isbn= 978-1-4684-6461-0|pages= 29–49|doi= 10.1007/978-1-4684-6459-7_2|first= A. R. van C.|last= Warrington}}&lt;/ref&gt; or knife-edge pivot, which carries a moving contact. These relays may work on either alternating or direct current, but for alternating current, a shading coil on the pole{{r|Mason|page1=14}} is used to maintain contact force throughout the alternating current cycle. Because the air gap between the fixed coil and the moving armature becomes much smaller when the relay has operated, the current required to maintain the relay closed is much smaller than the current to first operate it. The "returning ratio"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Power System Protection: Systems and methods|last= IEE|editor= Electricity Council |publisher= Peter Peregrinus|year= 1981|isbn= 9780906048535|location= London|pages= 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "differential" is the measure of how much the current must be reduced to reset the relay.

A variant application of the attraction principle is the plunger-type or solenoid operator. A [[reed relay]] is another example of the attraction principle.

"Moving coil" meters use a loop of wire turns in a stationary magnet, similar to a [[galvanometer]] but with a contact lever instead of a pointer. These can be made with very high sensitivity. Another type of moving coil suspends the coil from two conductive ligaments, allowing very long travel of the coil.

===Induction disc overcurrent relay===
[[File:Induction Disc Over Current Relay.jpg|thumb|240x240px|When the input current is above the current limit, the disk rotates, the contact moves left and reaches the fixed contact. The scale above the plate indicates the delay-time.]]
"Induction" disk meters work by inducing currents in a disk that is free to rotate; the rotary motion of the disk operates a contact. Induction relays require alternating current; if two or more coils are used, they must be at the same frequency otherwise no net operating force is produced.&lt;ref name=GEC97&gt;''Protective Relays Application Guide 3rd Edition'', GEC Alsthom Measurements Ltd. 1987, no ISBN, pages 9-10, 83-93&lt;/ref&gt; These electromagnetic relays use the induction principle discovered by [[Galileo Ferraris]] in the late 19th century. The magnetic system in induction disc overcurrent relays is designed to detect overcurrents in a power system and operate with a pre-determined time delay when certain overcurrent limits have been reached. In order to operate, the magnetic system in the relays produces torque that acts on a metal disc to make contact, according to the following basic current/torque equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Principles of Power System |author=Metha,V.K. &amp; Rohit |isbn= |date= July 2008|publisher=S Chand|chapter=Chapter 21|pages=503|edition= 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T \propto \phi_s \times \phi_u \sin \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\phi_u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_s&lt;/math&gt; are the two fluxes and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the phase angle between the fluxes

The following important conclusions can be drawn from the above equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fundamentals of Power System Protection|author1=Paithankar, Y.G.  |author2=Bhide, S.R.  |lastauthoramp=yes |isbn=978-81-203-4123-4 |date= July 2013|publisher=PHI Learning|chapter= |edition= 2nd|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Two alternating fluxes with a phase shift are needed for torque production.
*Maximum torque is produced when the two alternating fluxes are 90 degrees apart.
*The resultant torque is steady and not a function of time.

The relay's primary winding is supplied from the power systems current transformer via a plug bridge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Protection of Power System|author=Bakshi, U.A. &amp; A.V. |isbn= 978-81-8431-606-3 |year=2010 |publisher=Technical Publications|chapter= Chapter 1|page= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is called the plug setting multiplier (psm). Usually seven equally spaced tappings or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity. The primary winding is located on the upper electromagnet. The secondary winding has connections on the upper electromagnet that are energised from the primary winding and connected to the lower electromagnet. Once the upper and lower electromagnets are energised they produce eddy currents that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the flux paths. This relationship of eddy currents and fluxes creates torque proportional to the input current of the primary winding, due to the two flux paths being out of phase by 90°.

In an overcurrent condition, a value of current will be reached that overcomes the control spring pressure on the spindle and the braking magnet, causing the metal disc to rotate towards the fixed contact. This initial movement of the disc is also held off to a critical positive value of current by small slots that are often cut into the side of the disc. The time taken for rotation to make the contacts is not only dependent on current but also the spindle backstop position, known as the time multiplier (tm). The time multiplier is divided into 10 linear divisions of the full rotation time.

Providing the relay is free from dirt, the metal disc and the spindle with its contact will reach the fixed contact, thus sending a signal to trip and isolate the circuit, within its designed time and current specifications. Drop off current of the relay is much lower than its operating value, and once reached the relay will be reset in a reverse motion by the pressure of the control spring governed by the braking magnet.

===Static===
Application of electronic amplifiers to protective relays was described as early as 1928, using [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers and continued up to 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Power System Protection and Switchgear|last= Ram|first= Badri|origyear= 1994|publisher= Tata McGraw-Hill|year= 2007|isbn= 9780074623503|location= New Dehli|pages= 7|last2= Vishwakarma|first2= D.N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devices using electron tubes were studied but never applied as commercial products, because of the limitations of vacuum tube amplifiers. A relatively large standby current is required to maintain the tube filament temperature; inconvenient high voltages are required for the circuits, and vacuum tube amplifiers had difficulty with incorrect operation due to noise disturbances.

[[Static relay]]s have no or few moving parts, and became practical with the introduction of the [[transistor]]. Measuring elements of static relays have been successfully and economically built up from [[diode]]s, [[zener diode]]s, [[avalanche diode]]s, [[unijunction transistor]]s, p-n-p and n-p-n [[bipolar transistor]]s, [[field effect transistor]]s or their combinations.{{r|TSRAO|page1= 6}} Static relays offer the advantage of higher sensitivity than purely electromechanical relays, because power to operate output contacts is derived from a separate supply, not from the signal circuits. Static relays eliminated or reduced [[contact bounce]], and could provide fast operation, long life and low maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Switchgear and Power System Protection |last= Singh|first= Ravindra P. |publisher= PHI Learning Private Limited|year= 2009 |isbn= 978-81-203-3660-5|location= New Dehli|pages= 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital===

A microprocessor-based digital protection relay can replace the functions of many discrete electromechanical instruments. These relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor. The digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete electromechanical relays in one device,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Digital Protection: Protective Relaying from Electromechanical to Microprocessor|last= Singh|first= L.P.|publisher= New Age International|year= 1997|isbn= |location= New Dehli|pages= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; simplifying protection design and maintenance. Each digital relay can run self-test routines to confirm its readiness and alarm if a fault is detected. Digital relays can also provide functions such as communications ([[SCADA]]) interface, monitoring of contact inputs, metering, waveform analysis, and other useful features. Digital relays can, for example, store multiple sets of protection parameters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= |title=Novel Applications of a Digital Relay with Multiple Setting Groups |first1=Demetrios A. |last1=Tziouvaras |first2=William D. |last2=Hawbaker |author= |author-link= |date= October 1990 |conference=17th Annual Western Protective relay Conference, Spokane,Washington |conference-url= |editor= |others= |volume= |edition= |book-title= |publisher= |archive-url= |archive-date= |location= |pages= |format= |id= |isbn= |bibcode= |oclc= |doi= |access-date= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= |language= |page= |at= |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows the behavior of the relay to be changed during maintenance of attached equipment. Digital relays also can provide protection strategies impossible to implement with electromechanical relays. This is particularly so in long distance high voltage or multi-terminal circuits or in lines that are series or shunt compensated{{r|DPFPS|page1= 3}} They also offer benefits in self-testing and communication to supervisory control systems.

===Numerical===
The distinction between digital and numerical protection relay rests on points of fine technical detail, and is rarely found in areas other than Protection{{r|NPAG|page1= Ch 7, pp 102}}. Numerical relays are the product of the advances in technology from digital relays. Generally, there are several different types of numerical protection relays. Each type, however, shares a similar architecture, thus enabling designers to build an entire system solution that is based on a relatively small number of flexible components.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite techreport |first=Kaustubh |last=Gadgil|title=A Numerical Protection Relay Solution |number=SLAA466 |institution=Texas Instruments|year=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They use high speed processors executing appropriate algorithms{{r|TSRAO|page1= 51}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Algorithms and hardware design of modern numeric overcurrent and distance relays|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4553897|journal= Second International Conference on Electrical Engineering, 2008.

==Relays by functions==
The various protective functions available on a given relay are denoted by standard [[ANSI device numbers]]. For example, a relay including function 51 would be a timed overcurrent protective relay.

===Overcurrent relay===
An [[overcurrent]] relay is a type of protective relay which operates when the load current exceeds a pickup value. The [[ANSI device number]] is 50 for an instantaneous over current (IOC) or a Definite Time Overcurrent (DTOC). In a typical application the over current relay is connected to a current transformer and calibrated to operate at or above a specific current level. When the relay operates, one or more contacts will operate and energize to trip (open) a circuit breaker. The Definite Time Overcurrent Relay has been used extensively in the United Kingdom but its inherent issue of operating slower for faults closer to the source led to the development of the IDMT relay.{{r|YGP|page1= pp 30-31}} 

=== Inverse definite minimum time ===
The inverse definite minimum time (IDMT) protective relays were developed to overcome the shortcomings of the Definite Time Overcurrent Relays.{{r|YGP|page1=pp 30-31}}{{r|PPSP|page1=134}}

If the source impedance remains constant and the fault current changes appreciably as we move away from the  relay then it is advantageous to use IDMT overcurrent protection{{r|GRD110|page1=11}} to achieve high speed protection over a large section of the protected circuit.{{r|NPAG|page1=127}} However, if the source impedance is significantly larger than the feeder impedance then the characteristic of the IDMT relay cannot be exploited and DTOC may be utilized.{{r|PB|page1=42}}  Secondly if the source impedance varies and becomes weaker with less generation during light loads then this leads to slower clearance time hence negating the purpose of the IDMT relay.{{r|Warrington|page1=143}}

[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard 60255-151 specifies the IDMT relay curves as shown below. The four curves in Table 1 are derived from the now withdrawn [[British Standard]] BS 142.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BS 142-0:1992 - Electrical protection relays. General introduction and list of Parts|url = http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000000259901|website = shop.bsigroup.com|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other five, in Table 2, are derived from the  ANSI standard C37.112.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = IEEE Standard Inverse-Time Characteristic Equations for Overcurrent Relays|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=554945|journal = IEEE Std C37.112-1996|date = 1997-01-01|pages = i-|doi = 10.1109/IEEESTD.1997.81576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is more common to use IDMT relays for current  protection it is possible to utilize IDMT mode of operation for voltage protection{{r|REU610|page1=3}}. It is possible to program customised curves in some protective relays{{r|GEF35|page1=pp Ch2-9}} and other manufacturers{{r|SPAJ|page1=18}} have special curves specific to their relays. Some numerical relays can be used to provide inverse time overvoltage protection{{r|SEL1|page1=6}} or negative sequence overcurrent protection.{{r|NEGSEQ|page1=915}}

I&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = is the ratio of the fault current to the relay setting current or a Plug Setting Multiplier.{{r|Badri|page1=pp 73}} "Plug" is a reference from the electromechanical relay era and were available in discrete{{r|YGP|page1=pp 37}} steps.  TD is the Time Dial setting.

&lt;math&gt;PSM= \frac{Primary \ fault \ current}{Relay \ current \ setting \ \times \ CT \ ratio}&lt;/math&gt;

The above equations result in a "family" of curves  as a result of using different time multiplier setting (TMS) settings. It is evident from the relay characteristic equations  that a larger TMS will result in a slower clearance time for a given PMS (I{{sub|r}}) value.

===Distance relay/Impedance relay===
Distance relays differ in principle from other forms of protection in that their performance is not governed by the magnitude of the current or voltage in the protected circuit but rather on the ratio of these two quantities.  Distance relays are actually double actuating quantity relays with one coil energized by voltage and other coil by current.  The current element produces a positive or pick up torque while the voltage element produces a negative or reset torque.  The relay operates only when the '''V/I''' ratio falls below a predetermined value(or set value).  During a fault on the transmission line the fault current increases and the voltage at the fault point decreases.  The V/I &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= |title=Z = V/I Does Not Make a Distance Relay |first1=J. |last1=Roberts |first2=A |last2=Guzman |first3=E.O. |last3=Schweitzer, III |author= |author-link= |date= October 1993 |conference=20th Annual Western Protective relay Conference, Spokane,Washington |conference-url= |editor= |others= |volume= |edition= |book-title= |publisher= |archive-url= |archive-date= |location= |pages= |format= |id= |isbn= |bibcode= |oclc= |doi= |access-date= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= |language= |page= |at= |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ratio is measured at the location of [[Current transformer|CTs]] and [[Transformer types#Voltage transformer or potential transformer|PTs]].  The voltage at the PT location depends on the distance between the PT and the fault. If the measured voltage is lesser, that means the fault is nearer and vice versa. Hence the protection called Distance relay. The load flowing through the line appears as an impedance to the relay and sufficiently large loads (as impedance is inversely proportional to the load)  can lead to a trip of the relay even in the absence of a fault.{{r|RinconPerez2012|page1=467}}

===Current differential protection scheme===
A differential scheme acts on the difference between current entering a protected zone (which may be a bus bar, generator, transformer or other apparatus) and the current leaving that zone. A fault outside the zone gives the same fault current at the entry and exit of the zone, but faults within the zone show up as a difference in current. 

"The differential protection is 100% selective and therefore only responds to faults within its protected zone. The boundary of the protected zone is uniquely defined by the location of the [[current transformer]]s. Time grading with other protection systems is therefore not required, allowing for tripping without additional delay. Differential protection is therefore suited as fast main protection for all important plant items."{{r|Ziegler|page1=15}} 

Differential protection can be used to provide protection for zones with multiple terminals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Multi-Terminal Line Differential Protection |last=Moxley &amp; Lippert |url=https://w3.usa.siemens.com/smartgrid/us/en/transmission-grid/products/protection-relays/Documents/Multi-Terminal%2520Line%2520Diff%2520Protection%2520-%2520Moxley-Lippert.pdf |website=siemens.com |accessdate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |conference=63rd Annual Conference for Protective Relay Engineers |last1=Miller |first1=H. |last2=Burger |first2=J. |last3= Fischer |first3=N. |last4=Kasztenny |first4=B. |date= 2010 |doi= 10.1109/CPRE.2010.5469504 |publisher=IEEE |ISBN=978-1-4244-6073-1 |title=Modern Line Current Differential Protection Solutions |url=https://www.selinc.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6390 |page=3 |location=College Station, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used to protect lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= https://library.e.abb.com/public/a4fa838ad3627aa2c125735a002e7653/SA2007-000664_A_en_Practical_Experience_from_Multiterminal_Line_Differential_Protection_Installations.pdf|title= New and re-discovered theories and practices in relay protection |last= Gajić|first= Z.|conference= Relay Protection and Substation Automation of Modern Power Systems |doi= |pmid= |access-date= 11 January 2016|last2= Brnčić,|first2= I.|last3= Einarsson,|first3= T.|displayauthors= 3|first4= B.|last4= Ludqvist |date= September 2009 |publisher=CIGRE |book-title= |pages=1 |location= Cheboksary Chuvashia |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; generators, motors, transformers, and other electrical plant.

Current transformers in a differential scheme must be chosen to have near-identical response to high overcurrents. If a "through fault" results in one set of current transformers saturating before another, the zone differential protection will see a false "operate" current and may false trip. 

GFCI ([[ground fault circuit interrupter]]) circuit breakers combine overcurrent protection and differential protection (non-adjustable) in standard, commonly available modules.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=July 2016}}

===Directional relay===
A directional relay uses an additional polarizing source of voltage or current to determine the direction of a fault. Directional elements respond to the phase shift between a polarizing quantity and an operate quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |conference=63rd Annual Conference for Protective Engineers |last1=Zimmerman |first1=Karl |last2=Costello |first2=David |date=March 2010 |url=https://www.selinc.com/Workarea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=7273 |publisher=IEEE |title=Fundamentals and Improvements for Directional Relays |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1109/cpre.2010.5469483 |ISBN=978-1-4244-6073-1 |location=College Station, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fault can be located upstream or downstream of the relay's location, allowing appropriate protective devices to be operated inside or outside of the zone of protection.

===Synchronism check===
A synchronism checking relay provides a contact closure when the frequency and phase of two sources are similar to within some tolerance margin. A "synch check" relay is often applied where two power systems are interconnected, such as at a switchyard connecting two power grids, or at a generator circuit breaker to ensure the generator is synchronized to the system before connecting it.

==Power source==
The relays can also be classified on the type of power source that they use to work.
[[File:Image-Relay.jpg|thumb|right|A dual powered protection relay powered by the current obtained from the line by a CT. The striker is also shown]]

* Self-powered relays operate on energy derived from the protected circuit, through the current transformers used to measure line current, for example. This eliminates the cost and reliability question of a separate supply. 
* Auxiliary powered relays rely on a battery or external ac supply. Some relays can use either AC or DC. The auxiliary supply must be highly reliable during a system fault. 
* Dual powered relays can be also auxiliary powered, so all batteries, chargers and other external elements are made redundant and used as a backup.

The '''Renewable Energy Certificates Registry''' ('''REC-registry''') is an internet-based registry system established by the [[Renewable energy in Australia|Australian Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000]] (the Act),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/0/8994EB68074BFB4CCA257590000D85C9?OpenDocument ''Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000'']&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained by the [[Clean Energy Regulator]].

The REC-registry:
* facilitates the creation, registration, transfer and surrender of large-scale generation certificates (LGCs) and small-scale technology certificates (STCs),
* tracks the ownership and status of all certificates,
* provides access to the STC clearing house, and
* maintains various public registers as required by the Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rec-registry.gov.au/rec-registry/app/home Welcome to the REC Registry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1 January 2011, the primary mechanism in the [[Energy policy of Australia#Renewable energy targets|renewable energy target]] (RET) was the renewable energy certificate (REC). From 1 January 2011 RECs were split into small-scale technology certificates (STCs) and large-scale generation certificates (LGCs). RECs are still used as a general term covering both STCs and LGCs. 

All certificates must be created in the REC-registry before they can be bought, sold, traded or surrendered. Participants must hold an account and be registered as a REC-registry user to create, view or transfer certificates.

The layers are bonded by heat treatment.&lt;ref name="Rosco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roscocanoes.com.au/FAQ%60s/Materials%20%20Manufactoring/Royalex%20(RX)-253.aspx|title=Royalex (RX)|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for manufacture of durable, mid-priced [[canoe]]s.

==Development==
Royalex is basically a board comprising a 'sandwich' of standard rigid ABS sheets in the core of which is an ABS layer designed to foam/expand during the heating stage prior to vacuum forming.

Thus Royalex can be designed to form virtually any finished thickness to suit the end application. One just adds extra sheets.

Since ABS has a poor resistance to UV a thin outer layer of UV resistant vinyl is generally included. This can be self-coloured or painted.

ABS is a [[copolymer]] of rubber and thermoplastic, Acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene. It was developed at US Rubber Co's Chicago plant by Bob Pooley and was simply called Royalite. US Rubber was later renamed Uniroyal - a blanket name to encapsulate their worldwide enterprises, which previously had separate names.

Later Bob Pooley and associates continued work on Royalite to introduce a foaming/expandable element. This was accomplished at the Uniroyal plant in Warsaw, Indiana. The resulting product was named Royalex to recognise the expanding core.

Although extremely versatile as well as being very [[toughness|tough]], the material was expensive compared to available alternatives. Even so, many industries were attracted to evaluate Royalex. Items produced included Caravans (vacuum formed in two halves) the top was a mirror image of the base so that only one forming tool was required. White Motors introduced a limited run of tractor cabs. A company was formed to produce a repro of the famous 'Coffin nosed' Cord Deusenberg.
Gene Bordinat, Chief Designer at Ford designed a concept car in Royalex in 1965. This resulted in the 'Ford XP Bordinat Cobra'.

The writer brought both of these cars to London, England to show at the International Plastics Exhibition and for exposure to the then extensive automotive producers.

Royalex was extremely tough but if hit hard enough could be dented. If this happened such dents could be recovered by applying a hand held hot air gun which re-expanded the core to blow out the dent.

Sadly the cost, as well as the need to accost a different build technique when using Royalex, mitigated against its acceptance in large scale production and eventually simple canoe bodies became the main product. An additional reason was that following the breakup of the Uniroyal empire, product specialists were lost and there was no longer a team to drive the concept.

Royalex was developed by [[Uniroyal]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name = "missoulian"&gt;{{Cite news

In 2000 the Spartech Corporation took over the Uniroyal Royalex Manufacturing Division and secured the rights to manufacture Royalex at their factory in [[Warsaw, Indiana]].&lt;ref name = "plasticandwh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mv.com/users/morris/paddling/boat-repair/plastics.html|title=Plastics and Whitewater Boats|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, plastics company PolyOne, of [[Avon Lake, Ohio]] purchased Spartech, and decided to shut down Royalex production due to its low volume. The last sheets of Royalex were shipped from the factory in December, 2013.&lt;ref name = "missoulian"/&gt; Production will be shut down in April 2014.&lt;ref name = "rapidmediawhitewater"&gt;{{Cite web

==Uses==
The best known use of Royalex is for the manufacture of [[canoe]] [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s. Royalex is lighter, more resistant to UV damage from sunlight, is more rigid, and has greater structural memory than non-composite plastics used for this purpose, such as polyethylene. It is also quieter, faster, and more user friendly in cold or hot conditions than aluminium, described by canoeist [[Kent Ford (canoeist)|Kent Ford]] described as "noisy, heavy and hot."&lt;ref name = "canoeandkayak"&gt;{{Cite news

Royalex is heavier than fiber-reinforced composites, such as fiberglass, Kevlar, or graphite, and therefore less suited for high-performance paddling. However, Royalex is cheaper than Kevlar or carbon fiber, with better durability on rocky rivers.&lt;ref name = "missoulian"/&gt; Royalex canoes are lighter than polyethylene canoes.&lt;ref name = "canoeandkayak"/&gt;

{{globalize|date=October 2016}}
'''Solid wood''' is a term most commonly used to distinguish between ordinary [[lumber]] and [[engineered wood]], but it also refers to structures that do not have hollow spaces. Engineered wood products are manufactured by binding together [[wood]] strands, [[wood fiber|fibers]], or [[wood veneer|veneers]] with [[adhesive]]s to form a [[composite material]]. Engineered wood includes [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]] (OSB) and [[fiberboard]]. The fact that a product is made from solid wood is often touted in advertisements. However, using solid wood has advantages and disadvantages. 

==Comparison with engineered wood==
Perhaps the greatest advantage of solid wood is that the wood is the same all the way through, so repairs are relatively easy. Repairs to veneer are much more difficult and sometimes impossible.  

Solid wood furniture is strong enough to easily satisfy all furniture applications, and it can last for centuries. Society is still questioning whether furniture made of plywood (often made from pine) can do the same. Plywood and other engineered wood products used to make furniture are typically covered with a veneer such as Cherry. A definition of solid wood may be seen at :http://www.definitions.net/definition/solid%20wood

It is common today for furniture manufacturers and retailers to advertise such veneered plywood furniture as made of "wood solids with cherry veneers". Most customers believe that to mean solid planks of less expensive woods such as poplar, etc., with expensive woods such as cherry used for veneers. However, "wood solids" is a term of art. The "wood solids" are simply plywood, or another engineered wood product.

In the USA, the Federal Trade Commission doesn't allow furniture to be advertised as made of "solid wood" unless all exposed surfaces are in fact solid wood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/os/decisions/docs/vol114/FTC_VOLUME_DECISION_114_(_JANUARY_-_DECEMBER_1991)PAGES_486-586.pdf#page=47&lt;/ref&gt; Solid wood is expensive. Engineered wood (often advertised as wood solids) is not.

==Solid wood vs. hollow wood==
One of the most frequently made hollow wood structures are hollow core doors. Hollow core doors are much lighter than solid wood doors, cheaper and are easier to install. However, [[sound]] travels more freely through them, which can be a problem if the house is noisy or the occupants desire a lot of privacy. Also, hollow core doors should not be used as doors to the outside because they can more easily be broken open by robbers. Solid wood doors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Factors To Consider When Buying Just About Any Solid Wood Door |website=Glass Sliding Doors |type=Blog |language=en |date=24 May 2013 |url=http://glassslidingdoors.org/factors-to-consider-when-buying-just-about-any-solid-wood-door/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002003603/http://glassslidingdoors.org/factors-to-consider-when-buying-just-about-any-solid-wood-door/ |archive-date=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; are slightly more [[fire]] resistant because the fire has to burn through more material, however, using a [[steel]] door will increase fire resistance by a much larger margin.

The '''Stone of the Pregnant Woman''' ({{lang-ar|Hajar el Hibla|script=Latn|italic=yes}}) or '''Stone of the South''' is a [[Roman monolith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adam|first=Jean Pierre|title=Roman Building: Materials and Techniques|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415208666|author2=Anthony Mathews |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Baalbek]] (ancient Heliopolis), [[Lebanon]]. Together with another ancient stone block nearby, it is among the [[List of largest monoliths in the world|largest monoliths ever quarried]]. The two building blocks were presumably intended for the nearby [[Roman temple]] complex, possibly as an addition to the so-called [[trilithon]], and are characterised by a [[monolith]]ic gigantism that was unparallelled in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].

One says the monolith is named after a pregnant woman who tricked the people of Baalbek into believing that she knew how to move the giant stone if only they would feed her until she gave birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruprechtsberger|1999|pp=12f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say the name comes from the legends that pregnant [[jinn]] were assigned the task of cutting and moving the stone,&lt;ref name="Hanauer1907"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanauer|first=James Edward|title=Folk-lore of the Holy Land: Moslem, Christian and Jewish|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4cTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=12 March 2013|year=1907|publisher=Duckworth &amp; Company|pages=74–}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others say that the name reflects the belief that a woman who touches the stone experiences an increase in fertility.&lt;ref name="Doyle2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Paul|title=Lebanon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzsRk0hvb_MC&amp;pg=PA213|accessdate=12 March 2013|date=2012-03-01|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=9781841623702|pages=213–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The stone block still lies in the [[Classical antiquity|ancient]] quarry at a distance of 900&amp;nbsp;m from the Heliopolis temple complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruprechtsberger|1999|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, a [[geodesy|geodetic]] team of the [[Austria]]n city of [[Linz]] conducted topographical measurements at the site which aimed at establishing the exact dimensions of the two monoliths and their possible use in the construction of the gigantic [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruprechtsberger|1999|pp=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their calculations, the block weighs 1,000.12&amp;nbsp;[[Tonne|t]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruprechtsberger|1999|p=15}}, the calculation is based on a length of 21&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;/ref&gt; thus practically confirming older estimations such as that of [[Jean-Pierre Adam]].&lt;ref name="Adam 1977, 52"&gt;{{harvnb|Adam|1977|p=52}}: 970&amp;nbsp;t&lt;/ref&gt;

The rectangular stone block is:
* 20.31–20.76 m long&lt;ref name="Ruprechtsberger 1999, 15"&gt;{{harvnb|Ruprechtsberger|1999|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 4 m wide at the base&lt;ref name="Ruprechtsberger 1999, 15"/&gt;
* 4.14–5.29 m wide at the top&lt;ref name="Ruprechtsberger 1999, 15"/&gt;
* 4.21–4.32 m high&lt;ref name="Ruprechtsberger 1999, 15"/&gt;
* Has an estimated density of 2.6–2.8 [[Gram|g]]/cm³&lt;ref name="Ruprechtsberger 1999, 15"/&gt;

== Second monolith ==
[[File:Baalbek- largest stone.jpg|thumb|The second Roman monolith, discovered at Baalbek in the 1990s and weighing 1242 t.]]

A second ancient monolith was discovered in the same quarry in the 1990s. With its weight estimated at 1242 t, it surpasses even the dimension of the ''Stone of the Pregnant Woman''.&lt;ref name="Ruprechtsberger 1999, 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Ruprechtsberger|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are dimensions of the rectangular stone block, assuming that its shape is consistent in its still-buried parts:
* 19.5–20.5 m long&lt;ref name="Ruprechtsberger 1999, 17"/&gt;
* 4.34–4.56 m wide&lt;ref name="Ruprechtsberger 1999, 17"/&gt;
* 4.5 m high&lt;ref name="Ruprechtsberger 1999, 17"/&gt;
* Has an estimated density of 2.6–2.8 g/cm³&lt;ref name="Ruprechtsberger 1999, 17"/&gt;

== Third monolith == 
A third ancient monolith was discovered in the same quarry in 2014 by the [[German Archaeological Institute]]. Its weight is estimated at around 1650 t, making it the largest stone ever carved by human hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Archaeologists Discover The World's Largest Ancient Stone Block| work = io9| accessdate = 2014-11-29| url = http://io9.com/archaeologists-discover-the-worlds-largest-ancient-ston-1664281050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It measures:
* 19.6 m long
* 6 m wide
* at least 5.5 m high (still partly buried)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5153">The '''water associated fraction''' ('''WAF'''), sometimes termed the '''water-soluble fraction''' ('''W.S.F.'''), is the solution of low [[molecular mass]] [[hydrocarbon]]s naturally released from [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbon mixture]]s in contact with [[water]]. Although generally regarded as [[hydrophobic]], many petroleum hydrocarbons are [[water-soluble|soluble]] in water to a limited extent. This combination often also contains less soluble, higher molecular mass components, and more soluble products of [[chemical degradation|chemical]] and [[biological degradation]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison G, Lamont N. Simulated Time-based Studies To Evaluate Changes In Crude Oil Composition Through Evaporation And Biodegradation. Wessex Institute of Technology Oil and Hydrocarbon Spill Conference Greece 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
Low molecular mass [[Chemical compound|compound]]s account for much of the [[toxicity|toxic]] nature of hydrocarbon [[oil spill|spills]]. In particular, [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[ethyl benzene]] and the [[xylene]]s ([[BTEX]]) are of great [[Environmental quality|environment]]al interest due to their availability to [[organism]]s. This availability, also influenced by [[Volatile organic compound|volatility]] and [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], impacts on [[biodegradation]] and [[bioremediation]] in water and [[soil]] environments, with even dissolved components within [[pore water]] considered [[bioavailability|bioavailable]].&lt;ref&gt;Megharaj M, Ramakrishnan B, Venkateswarlu K, Sethunathan N, Naidu R. Bioremediation approaches for organic pollutants: A critical perspective. Environment International 2011;37(8):1362-1375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concentration==
The WAF is found in greatest concentration in close proximity to the bulk phase of hydrocarbons, the progress of which is often limited by physical containment measures such as [[oil boom|booms]]. The dissolved components of petroleum mixtures such as [[crude oil]] can become subject to the transport mechanisms of the bulk aqueous phase.&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Soil Mechanics. 6th rev. ed. E and FN Spon, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reusser D, Istok J, Beller H, Field J. In situ transformation of deuterated toluene and xylene to benzylsuccinic acid analogues in BTEX-contaminant|contaminated aquifers.

Poler fuel constituents: compound identification and equilibrium partitioning between non aqueous phase liquids and water. Environmental Science and Technology 2002;36(19):4074-4080.&lt;/ref&gt; Source identification of these can therefore become problematic without the visual indications usually expected with petroleum hydrocarbon spills. However, after relatively short periods of exposure, the [[chemical profile]] of the original oils is still largely intact, allowing [[chemical analysis]] to provide identification and discriminate between different petroleum sources.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont N. The screening of petroleum hydrocarbons based on the water associated fraction. Global Forensic Science today 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution==
In freshwater aquatic environments, [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] is the greatest physical [[weathering]] process after [[evaporation]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt T, Kleinert P, Stengel C, Goss K, Haderlein S. Poler fuel constituents: compound identification and equilibrium partitioning between non aqueous phase liquids and water. Environmental Science and Technology 2002;36(19):4074-4080.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the same conditions, the rate of dissolution is between 0.01% and 1% of the rate of evaporation for [[alkane]]s and [[aromatic compound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gill R, Robotham P. Input, behaviour and fates of petroleum hydrocarbons. In Trett M, Green J, editors. The fate and effects of oil in freshwater: Elsevier Applied Science, 1989;41-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Once dissolved, these components are more available to organisms and therefore susceptible to biodegradation processes and experience increased rates of [[photochemical degradation|photochemical]] and chemical degradation.&lt;ref&gt;Brown M. Biodegradation of oil in freshwater. In Trett M, Green J, editors. The fate and effects of oil in freshwater: Elsevier Applied Science, 1989;197-213.&lt;/ref&gt; These components represent some of the most toxic oil ingredients because of their increased bioavailability, with reduction in toxicity occurring on [[emulsification]] or [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] to [[colloid]]s which restrict availability to organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Suthersan S, Natural and enhanced remediation systems. CRC, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamont N. The screening of petroleum hydrocarbons based on the water associated fraction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2473">'''Water cycle management''' relates to all planning, strategy development, operational and tactical decisions to optimize the [[water cycle]] to satisfy human or environmental objectives. It is used in different organizations to mean management of a sub-set of the whole water cycle. In Australia, it has been adopted to encompass the [[fresh water]] to [[sewage disposal]] cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/water/policy/total-water-cycle-management.html Queensland Government - Total Water Cycle Management]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/Urban-water/Country-Towns-Program/Best-practice-management/Integrated-Water-Cycle-Management/Integrated-Water-Cycle-Management/default.aspx New South Wales Government Integrated water cycle management]&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, it refers to a more holistic view of the water cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irrigationfutures.org.au/projects.asp?ID=33 Cooperative Research Centre for irrigation futures - water cycle management]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better Urban Water Management|url=http://www.water.wa.gov.au/planning-for-the-future/water-and-land-use-planning/better-urban-water-management|website=Government of Western Australia Department of Water}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scientific and engineering disciplines may be involved in water cycle management:
* [[Meteorology]] deals with predicting and measuring [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] 
* [[Water resource management]] deals with the management overview of fresh [[water resources]] available in defined areas
* [[Hydrology]] measures water flow in river  and underground and predicts flow patterns using outputs from meteorology together with mathematical modelling of [[river]] and [[groundwater]] flow
* Water engineering encompasses [[water treatment]], [[Sewerage]] and [[sewage treatment]] amongst other disciplines, providing clean water to homes and business and taking away contaminated water to be cleaned and made available for re-use.
* [[Water conservation]] deals principally with techniques and practices for minimizing use of water whilst achieving  desired objectives.
* [[Environmental monitoring]] provides information and trends on the impact of policies adopted in water cycle management on [[eco-system]]s and sensitive biota; for example the effects of reduced river flows on [[salmon]] spawning.
