'''Adult animation''', '''adult cartoon''' or '''mature animation''', is any type of [[animation|animated]] motion work that is mainly targeted towards adults and older adolescents, as opposed to children or all-ages audiences. Works in this genre may be considered adult for any number of reasons, such as complex themes, sexual or suggestive content, graphic violence, profane language or dark humor. Works in this genre may explore philosophical, political, or social issues. Some productions are noted for sophisticated and/or experimental storytelling and animation techniques.

In the United States, before the enforcement of the [[Hays Code]], some cartoon shorts contained humor that was aimed at adult audience members rather than children. Following the introduction of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]], [[independent animation]] producers attempted to establish an alternative to mainstream animation. Initially, few animation studios in the United States attempted to produce animation for adult audiences, but later examples of animation produced for adults would gain mainstream attention and success.

==History==

===United States===
====Pre-code animation====
The earliest cartoon series were based upon popular [[comic strip]]s, and were directed at family audiences. Most animation produced during the [[silent film]] era was not intended to be shown to any specific age group, but occasionally contained humor that was directed at adult audience members, including risqué jokes.&lt;ref name="Cohen-9"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Animation and censorship in the silent film era |pages=9–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumed audience of these early cartoons, particularly ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', has alternated from their initial unspecific audience, to children, and back to general audiences as "classics".{{Disputed inline|"Early" cartoons|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first1=Jason|last1=Mittell|title=Genre and Television|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135458836|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known instance of censorship in animation occurred when the censorship board of Pennsylvania requested that references to [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] be removed from [[Walt Disney]]'s 1925 short ''[[Alice Comedies|Alice Solves a Puzzle]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-9"/&gt; One of the earliest animated [[pornographic films]] was ''[[Eveready Harton in Buried Treasure]]'', produced circa 1928. It has often been suggested that the film was produced for a private party in honor of [[Winsor McCay]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-9"/&gt; Rumors suggest that the film was developed in [[Cuba]] years after it was completed, because no lab in New York City would process the film.&lt;ref name="Cohen-9"/&gt; When a print was screened in San Francisco in the late 1970s, the program notes attributed the animation to [[George Stallings]], George Canata, Rudy Zamora, Sr. and [[Walter Lantz]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-9"/&gt;

The [[Motion Picture Association of America]], then known as the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association, was established in 1922 as the result of public objection to adult content in films, and a series of guidelines were established, suggesting content that should not be portrayed in films.&lt;ref name="Cohen-9"/&gt; Until the [[Hays Code]] was enforced, many animated shorts featured suggestive content, including [[sexual innuendo]], references to alcohol and drug use, and mild [[profanity]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-13"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Pre-Code films – the early sound era |pages=13–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1933 short ''[[Bosko's Picture Show]]'', [[Bosko]] appears to use adult words, although it has also been suggested that the character is saying "[[fox]]", or even "[[mug]]".&lt;ref name="Cohen-13"/&gt;

The [[Betty Boop]] series was known for its use of jokes that would eventually be considered taboo following the enforcement of the Hays Code, including the use of nudity.&lt;ref name="Cohen-13" /&gt; Betty Boop was initially drawn as a dog, and cast as the girlfriend of another Fleischer character, [[Bimbo (Fleischer)|Bimbo]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-13" /&gt; Betty was redesigned as a human, but the series continued to suggest a love relationship between the two that went farther than the normal relationship between humans and their pets.&lt;ref name="Cohen-13" /&gt; The short ''[[Is My Palm Read]]'' contains a scene in which Betty is shown as a child between the ages of four and five, bathing in the nude.&lt;ref name="Cohen-13" /&gt; In the 1970s, this scene was shown out of context in performances by [[Oingo Boingo|The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo]]. Concert audiences were not aware that Betty was supposed to be a baby in the sequence.&lt;ref name="Cohen-13" /&gt;

Another short, ''Bamboo Isle'', contains a sequence in which Betty dances the [[hula]] topless, wearing only a [[lei (garland)|lei]] over her breasts and a [[grass skirt]]. According to animator [[Shamus Culhane]], [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] were shocked by the sequence, but because it was a major sequence, it could not be cut out of the film. Culhane also states that he does not remember any instance in which the film was censored.&lt;ref name="Cohen-13"/&gt; Betty’s hula animation was reused for a cameo appearance with [[Popeye the Sailor]] in his self-titled animated debut short.

Following the enforcement of the Hays Code, Betty's clothing was redesigned, and all future shorts portrayed her with a longer dress which did not portray her physique and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Cohen-20"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=The effects of censorship on the Fleischer Studios |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shorts produced following the enforcement of the Hays Code were also less surreal in nature, and Betty was portrayed as a rational adult.&lt;ref name="Cohen-20"/&gt;

====After the Hays Code====

=====Ralph Bakshi=====
[[File:RalphBakshiJan09.jpg|thumb|left|Ralph Bakshi successfully established an alternative to mainstream animation through independent and adult-oriented productions in the 1970s.]]
By the late-1960s, animator [[Ralph Bakshi]] felt that he could not continue to produce the same kind of animation as he had in the past. Bakshi was quoted in a 1971 article for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as saying that the idea of "grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers, while American planes are dropping bombs in [[Vietnam]] and kids are marching in the streets, is ludicrous."&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartOne/FritzOne.htm |title=The Filming of ''Fritz the Cat'': Bucking the Tide |accessdate=2 March 2007 |author=Barrier, Michael |authorlink=Michael Barrier (historian) |date=Spring 1972 |publisher=Funnyworld, No. 14 |quote= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070415194357/http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartOne/FritzOne.htm| archivedate= 15 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; With producer [[Steve Krantz]], Bakshi founded his own studio, Bakshi Productions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |page=54 |chapter=First Gigs }}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators. He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time.{{sfn|Sito|2006|page=50}}

In 1969, [[Ralph's Spot]] was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for [[Coca-Cola]] and ''[[Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse]]'', a series of educational shorts paid for by [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Television/radio Age |year=1969 |publisher=Television Editorial Corp |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=58; 62–63; 80–81 |chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. Bakshi soon developed ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'', a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt; While browsing the East Side Book Store on [[St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)|St. Mark's Place]], Bakshi came across a copy of [[Robert Crumb]]'s ''[[Fritz the Cat]]''. Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt;

''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'' was the first animated film to receive an [[X-rated|X rating]] from the MPAA, and the highest grossing independent animated film of all time.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt; While the film is widely noted in its innovation for featuring content that had not been portrayed in American animation before, such as explicit sexuality and violence, the film also offered commercial potential for alternative and independent animated films in the [[United States]], as the film offered a mature, satirical portrayal of the 1960s, including portrayal of drug use, political tension and race relations.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=John |title=Masters of Animation |year=2001 |publisher=Watson-Guptill |isbn=0-8230-3041-5 |pages=18–29 |chapter=Ralph Bakshi }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi has been credited for playing an important role in establishing animation as a medium where any story can be told, rather than a medium for children.&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert W. |last=Butler |title=''Animated films are banging seriously at the academy’s glass ceiling'' |url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/story/1008376.html |work=[[The Kansas City Star]] |date=31 January 2009 |accessdate=2 March 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the acceptance of Bakshi's features, the director suggested that ''[[War and Peace]]'' could be produced as an animated film.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

Because of the perception that ''Fritz the Cat'' was pornographic, Krantz attempted to appeal the film's rating, but the MPAA refused to hear the appeal.&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Ralph Bakshi's ''Fritz the Cat'' and ''Heavy Traffic'' |pages=81–84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', and the film's acceptance into the [[1972 Cannes Film Festival]] cleared up previous misconceptions.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt; Bakshi then simultaneously directed a number of animated films, starting with ''[[Heavy Traffic]]''. Krantz was nervous about showing too much nudity and sexual content, and had several versions of some scenes animated.&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt; Thanks to ''Heavy Traffic'', Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since [[Walt Disney]] to have two financially successful films released back-to-back.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|page=275}} Although the film was critically praised, it was banned by the film censorship board in the province of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] when it was originally released.&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt;

Bakshi's next film, ''[[Coonskin (film)|Coonskin]]'' was produced by [[Albert S. Ruddy]]. The film, culled from Bakshi's interest in African-American history in America, was an attack on racism and racist stereotypes.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Darius |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= St. Martin's Griffin|location= New York|isbn=0-312-13192-5 |chapter=Rappin' with the rib-ticklin' Ralph Bakshi |pages=117–123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi hired several African-American animators to work on ''Coonskin'' and another feature, ''[[Hey Good Lookin' (film)|Hey Good Lookin']]'',&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=''Coonskin'' |pages=84–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Brenda Banks]], the first African-American female animator.{{sfn|Sito|2006|pages=230–231}} After the release was stalled by protests from the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], which accused both the film and Bakshi himself of being racist, the film was given [[limited release|limited distribution]], advertised as an [[exploitation film]], and soon disappeared from theaters.&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt;

Bakshi avoided controversy by producing [[fantasy film]]s, including ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]''. Bakshi did not produce another animated feature film after the 1992 release of ''[[Cool World]]''.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; In 2015, after securing funding through a [[Kickstarter]] campaign, he released the short film ''[[Last Days of Coney Island]]'' on the internet.

=====Other animated features=====
Although some adult-oriented animated films achieved success, very few animation studios in the United States produced explicitly adult animation during the 1970s, and much of the adult-oriented animation produced in the 1980s and 1990s was critically and commercially unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; Krantz produced ''[[The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat]]'' without Bakshi's involvement, and it was released in June 1974 to negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sabin |first1=Roger |title=Comic Books for Adults |year=1992 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0-415-04419-7 |page=212 |chapter=Aspects }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Swenson]] developed ''[[Down and Dirty Duck]]'' as a project for [[Flo and Eddie]] ([[Howard Kaylan]] and [[Mark Volman]], formerly of [[The Turtles]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]]) under the title ''Cheap!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |chapter=Dirty Duck |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9|page=66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen-89"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Charles Swenson's ''Dirty Duck'' |pages=89–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, produced by [[Roger Corman]], was released on June 13, 1977&lt;ref&gt;Kaylan, Howard, "Getting Spit On By the Boss Himself!". ''Shell Shocked''. P. 215. Backbeat, 2013. 978-1-61780-846-3.&lt;/ref&gt; under the title ''Dirty Duck'', and received negative reviews.&lt;ref name="Cohen-89"/&gt; 

However, in 1987, [[Italian-Canadian]] cartoonist [[Danny Antonucci]], who would later create the television series ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' for [[Cartoon Network]], released a successful short film titled ''[[Lupo the Butcher]]''. The short follows the story of a psychotic, temperamental butcher who swears at his meat when the smallest things go wrong. Produced by [[Marv Newland]]'s International Rocketship Limited, ''Lupo the Butcher'' has become a cult following and opened floodgates to irreverent adult animated series.&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;Mac, Gabe (August 25, 2006).

Animated films portraying serious stories began to regain notice from mainstream audiences in the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; ''[[Persepolis (film)|Persepolis]]'', a 2007 adaptation of [[Marjane Satrapi]]'s [[Persepolis (comics)|autobiographical graphic novel]], won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]]&lt;ref name="Lankarani"&gt;{{cite news |first=Leily |last=Lankarani |title=''Hollywood Comes To Tehran'' |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/02/28/world/worldwatch/entry4835653.shtml |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=28 February 2009 |accessdate=2 March 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090305055632/http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/02/28/world/worldwatch/entry4835653.shtml| archivedate= 5 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=2008 Oscars- 80th Academy Awards Nominations Coverage – Nominees| url= http://www.digitalhit.com/academy/80/nominees.shtml | date= 22 January 2008| accessdate= 19 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iran]]ian government protested the film's inclusion in the Festival,&lt;ref name="Lankarani"/&gt; but later allowed the film to be screened in a censored version, which altered the film's sexual content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Rare Iran screening for controversial film &lt;nowiki&gt;'Persepolis'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j42rPk2BytF_nzJMitnhfe-sP4hw |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=14 February 2008 |accessdate=2 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522125111/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j42rPk2BytF_nzJMitnhfe-sP4hw |archivedate=22 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 [[Israel]]i film ''[[Waltz with Bashir]]'', an animated [[Documentary film|documentary]] involving the [[1982 Lebanon War]], was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Beth |last=Saulnier |title=''&lt;nowiki&gt;'Waltz with Bashir'&lt;/nowiki&gt; offers a unique resonance'' |url=http://www.theithacajournal.com/article/20090226/ENTERTAINMENT02/902260307 |work=[[The Ithaca Journal]] |date=26 February 2009 |accessdate=2 March 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 film ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke (film)|The Killing Joke]]'' was the first film in the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]] series and the first animated [[Batman]] film to receive an R rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], with [[Warner Bros.

====Festivals====
In 1988, [[San Francisco]] exhibitor [[Expanded Cinema]] screened a compilation of adult-oriented animated shorts under the title "Outrageous Animation".&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Programs of shorts – from the Tournée of animation to Sick &amp; Twisted shows |pages=102–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising the package as containing "the wildest cartoons ever", the screenings contained shorts produced outside the United States, as well as independently produced American shorts.&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt; Reviews of the festival were mixed. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' writer [[Mick LaSalle]] hated almost everything screened at the festival, with the exception of [[Bill Plympton]]'s ''[[One of Those Days]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt; In ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', David Armstrong gave the show a three-star review and described the films screened as having "some of the rude vitality of the great old Warner Bros. cartoons —and a good deal of the sexual explicitness denied those old favorites from a more cautious age."&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt;

In 1990, Mellow Manor Productions began screening films under the title ''[[Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt; Founders Craig "Spike" Decker and Mike Gribble promoted their festival by handing out flyers on the streets rather than with traditional promotional techniques.&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt; In 1991, Decker and Gribble screened their first "All Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation", promising "wild and zany films that could never be shown to our 'normal audience'".&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt; The festival screened newer independent shorts, as well as older shorts such as ''Bambi Meets Godzilla'', and ''Thank You Mask Man''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt; Although the festival promoted works by animators who would later gain mainstream success, such as [[Bill Plympton]], [[Mike Judge]], [[Trey Parker]] and [[Don Hertzfeldt]], many reviewers dismissed the bulk of the programming as [[shock value]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt;

In 2003, Judge and Hertzfeldt created a new touring festival of animation marketed towards adults and college students. [[The Animation Show]] brought animated shorts into more North American theaters than any previous commercial festival.&lt;ref name="animation show"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animationshow.com/About |title=About The Animation Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Television animation====
From 1972 to 1974, [[Hanna-Barbera]] produced ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]'', an adult-oriented sitcom in the style of ''[[All in the Family]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McNeil |first1=Alex |title=Total Television: A Comprehensive Guide to Programming from 1948 to 1980 |year=1980 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0-14-004911-8 |page=755 |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series dealt with subjects such as [[feminism]] and the [[generation gap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jerome |first1=Fiona |last2=Dickson |first2=Seth |title=Classic TV: The Friends, The Foes, The Fighters of Crime, The Good, The Glam, and The Famous Last Line |year=2006 |isbn=1-4027-3672-X |page=16 |chapter=Before ''The Simpsons'' |publisher=Main Street |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of animated television programs appeared which challenged the [[Standards &amp; Practices]] guidelines, including ''[[The Simpsons]]'',&lt;ref name="Cohen-144"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Breaking the rules in the 1990s |pages=144–146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[The Critic]]'', ''[[The Brothers Grunt]]'' and ''[[Duckman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mangan |first=Jennifer|title="Modern Life Not Meant For Kids" - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=April 7, 2014 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/doc/283626453.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Breaking the rules in the 1990s |pages=143–144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' aired in prime time, therefore it was not censored as much as programs intended to air on Saturday mornings.&lt;ref name="Cohen-144"/&gt; In addition to the show's portrayal of brief nudity and mild language, the series has dealt with mature themes and subjects such as death, gambling addiction, religion and suicide.&lt;ref name="Cohen-144"/&gt;

In 1989, ''The Simpsons'' began airing on [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] in prime time, becoming a massive hit among American audiences. In response, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] each developed animated series to air in prime time, but none of the shows were successful.&lt;ref name="PrimeTimeAnimation"&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first=Carol A. |editor1-last=Stabile |editor2-first=Mark |editor2-last=Harrison |title=Prime Time Animation: Television Animation and American Culture |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-28326-4 |pages=79–80 |chapter=The second prime time animation boom }}&lt;/ref&gt; One series, ''[[Capitol Critters]]'', focused on subjects such as gun control, interracial violence and political corruption.&lt;ref name="Lowry"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lowry |first1=Brian |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Variety Television Reviews 1991–92 |year=1994 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0-8240-3796-0 |chapter=Capitol Critters |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the series, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' critic Brian Lowry wrote that he felt that the series' approach was "muddled", and that "the bland central character and cartoonish elements [...] will likely be off-putting to many adults, who won't find the political satire biting enough to merit their continued attention. Similarly, kids probably won't be as smitten with the cartoon aspects or look".&lt;ref name="Lowry"/&gt; The series was cancelled after one month.&lt;ref name="PrimeTimeAnimation"/&gt; ''The Critic'' was somewhat more successful, but achieved low ratings because of ABC's sporadic scheduling, and was cancelled by the network.&lt;ref name="PrimeTimeAnimation"/&gt; Fox picked up the series, but cancelled it four months later.&lt;ref name="PrimeTimeAnimation"/&gt; While Fox allowed ''The Simpsons'' to portray animated depictions of human buttocks, ABC would not allow similar scenes to appear on ''The Critic''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-144"/&gt;

''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' was controversial for its portrayal of brief nudity, profanity and violence.&lt;ref name="Cohen-146"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=''Beavis &amp; Butt-head'' and the S&amp;P Rules |pages=146–148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the series was intended for adult audiences, it was shown in the afternoons, and multiple parents claimed that their children had imitated the show's characters.&lt;ref name="Cohen-146"/&gt; The first instance of such an accusation occurred when animal lovers in [[Santa Cruz, California]] claimed that someone had blown up a cat after seeing Beavis and Butt-head perform this act on television.&lt;ref name="Cohen-146"/&gt; In actuality, no such scene had ever been portrayed.&lt;ref name="Cohen-146"/&gt; When a five-year-old boy in Ohio set his bed on fire, killing his two-year-old sister, critics claimed that the incident was the result of an episode involving fire, although it has never been proven that the boy had ever watched the series.&lt;ref name="Cohen-146"/&gt; [[MTV]] responded by moving the series to a later airtime and adding disclaimers to future episodes stating explicitly not to imitate the actions of the characters, as well as removing all references to fire from the episodes.&lt;ref name="Cohen-146"/&gt;

Discussions involving a series based upon Trey Parker and [[Matt Stone]]'s video Christmas card, ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|The Spirit of Christmas]]'', led [[HBO]] to contact Ralph Bakshi in order to produce an animated series targeted specifically toward adults.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-234"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=234–235 |chapter=Ups &amp; Downs }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi enlisted a team of writers, including his son, Preston, to develop ''[Spicy Detective'', later renamed ''[[Spicy City]]'', an [[anthology series]] set in a [[Film noir|noir-ish]], technology-driven future.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; Each episode featuring a different story narrated by a female host named [[Raven]], voiced by [[Michelle Phillips]]. The series premiered in July 1997, beating ''South Park'' to television by over a month and becoming the first "adults only" cartoon series.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-234"/&gt; Although critical reaction was mixed and largely unfavorable, ''Spicy City'' received acceptable ratings.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; A second season was approved, but the network wanted to fire Bakshi's writing team and hire professional [[Los Angeles]] screenwriters. When Bakshi refused to cooperate with the network, the series was canceled.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-234"/&gt;

In 2001, [[Time Warner]] established [[Adult Swim]] as a programming block on Cartoon Network, aimed for an adult audience. Its schedule currently includes original programs such as ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'' and ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', and reruns of syndicated programs such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[King of the Hill]]'' (all of which had their original run on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Suzanne C. |last=Ryan |title=''Adult Swim makes a splash: Cartoon Network lures viewers with an edgy lineup'' |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/04/14/adult_swim_makes_a_splash/ |work=The Boston Globe |date=14 April 2005 |accessdate=4 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American audiences have become more accepting of adult-oriented animation through the popularity of American-produced comedic television shows. Dramatic series such as ''[[Aeon Flux]]'' and ''[[Invasion America]]'' are less common, and still rarely successful.&lt;ref name="Lent-65"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lent |first1=John A. |title=Animation in Asia and the Pacific |year=2001 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-34035-7 |chapter=Anime in the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In 1954, a British film studio produced an animated adaptation of [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]''. This film is believed to have been one of the earliest examples of British animation, and like the book is meant to be a portrayal or critique of [[Stalinism]] with characters serving as analogues to figures from the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].

For many years, it had been problematic to import films that did not meet the approval of the [[United States Customs Service]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Importing foreign productions |pages=90–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the [[Customs Service]] refused entry of a short film titled ''Sinderella'', depicting scenes of [[sexual intercourse]] between characters based upon ''[[Cinderella]]'', ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'', ''[[Puss in Boots (fairy tale)|Puss in Boots]]'', ''[[The Story of the Three Bears|Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]'' and ''[[Prince Charming]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"/&gt; The film was seized as obscene material, and its distributor filed a court case and an appeal in 1974, but lost both.&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"/&gt;

In 1973, [[Rene Laloux]] directed ''[[La Planète sauvage]]'' based on the [[France|French]] science fiction novel ''[[Oms en série]]'' by [[Stefan Wul]]. It has been televised in the United States and United Kingdom as ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'', and several DVD editions have been released. Also in 1973, an [[Italy|Italian]] film, ''[[Il nano e la strega|King Dick]]'', was released and became a cult classic in the United Kingdom. A [[West Germany|West German]] short called ''[[Snow White and the Seven Perverts]]'' ("''[[Schneeflittchen unter die Sieben Bergen]]''") also appeared. This little film mostly parodies [[Snow White]] and has been included as part of other compilation films.

The first foreign animated feature to receive both an X rating and [[wide release|wide distribution]] in the [[United States]] was ''[[Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"/&gt; A dubbed version, which featured new dialogue performed by American actors and comedians such as [[John Belushi]], [[Adolph Caesar]], [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], [[Judy Graubart]], [[Bill Murray]] and [[Johnny Weissmuller Jr.]], received an R rating.&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"/&gt; According to distributor [[Stuart S. Shapiro]], the X rating hurt the film's distribution, but the dubbed version "took the bite out of the film. It lost its outrageousness."&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"/&gt; ''Tarzoon'' was banned by the New Zealand Board of Censors in 1980.&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"/&gt;

In [[England]], [[Martin Rosen (director)|Martin Rosen]] directed two animated features based on the novels of [[Richard Adams]]: ''[[Watership Down (film)|Watership Down]]'' in 1978, and ''[[The Plague Dogs (film)|The Plague Dogs]]'' in 1982. Both films deal with adult themes: ''Watership Down'', the negotiation of leadership to organize an exodus away from persecution, and ''[[The Plague Dogs]]'' on animal testing.

''[[Pink Floyd – The Wall]]'', an adaptation of [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[concept album]] [[The Wall|of the same name]], featured fifteen minutes of painstaking traditional animation in addition to numerous live-action sequences; although the film was not by any stretch pornographic, it was an adult film (with numerous references to drugs, mental illness and sex, along with one animated sequence portraying a character talking out of his [[rectum]] and having a [[scrotum]] for a beard) and received an R rating when imported to the United States.
	 
In 1986, England produced yet another politically-themed animation, ''[[When the Wind Blows (1986 film)|When the Wind Blows]]'', about an older couple whose home undergoes a nuclear attack.

''[[Werner (comics)|Werner]]'' - a German animated film based on the comic book. In an episode of many characters use profanity and [[middle finger|flip the bird]].

''[[Felidae (film)|Felidae]]'' is a 1994 German animated neo-noir crime film based on [[Akif Pirinçci|Akif Pirinçci's]] 1989 [[Felidae (novel)|novel of the same name]]. It features graphic violent and sexual content involving animals.

[[Soyuzmultfilm]] produced children's animation as well as animations aimed more at adults, such as [[Film, Film, Film]], a satirical animation about the film industry in the Soviet Union, and [[Laughter and Grief by the White Sea#Notes|Pomorskaya Byl]], a serious account of the death of two [[Pomor]] fishermen, stranded in the middle of the [[White Sea]].

===Japan===
{{see also|Anime}}
[[File:Anime DVDs.JPG|thumb|Shelves displaying Japanese anime.]]
Adult animation is known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|アダルトアニメ}} (adult anime). In both English and Japanese, the word "adult" may carry connotations of a sexual nature, but anime on serious topics such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' or ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' often get referred to as "adult" in Japan as well, even when sex is not a key part of the story.

Animated works of an erotic nature have come to be described in western fandom as ''[[hentai]]'', the Japanese word for "perverted",&lt;ref name="Poitras-50"&gt;{{cite book|title=Anime Essentials: Every Thing a Fan Needs to Know|last1=Poitras|first1=Gilles|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|year=2001|isbn=1-880656-53-1|page=50|chapter=Hentai}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Japan they are more likely to be referred to as {{nihongo|18禁アニメ}} (R-18 anime) or {{nihongo|エロアニメ}} (erotic anime).  Although some associate all anime with sexual content, hentai only makes up a very small portion of the Japanese animation industry.&lt;ref name="Poitras-50" /&gt; As the result of the misconceptions about Japanese animation, some video stores outside Japan have classified children's anime as for adults only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Poitras |first1=Gilles |title=Anime Essentials: Every Thing a Fan Needs to Know |year=2001 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |isbn=1-880656-53-1 |page=52 |chapter=Press coverage of sex and anime }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many video stores have also categorized all adult-oriented animation as anime, including the works of [[Ralph Bakshi]], the [[France|French]] animated film ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'', the [[Canada|Canadian]] animated film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' and the [[HBO]] television series ''[[Todd McFarlane's Spawn]]''.&lt;ref name="Lent-65" /&gt;  In the case of ''Spawn'', [[Todd McFarlane]] directly listed [[anime]] as an influence, particularly [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', and stated his hope that the show would help encourage the rise of adult animation on [[North America]]n [[Television network|network]]s. This in part lead to the involvement of the Japanese studio [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] in the production, in an attempt to "combine" the Eastern and Western styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=Todd McFarlane's Spawn 2 |url= |first=Todd |last=McFarlane |authorlink=Todd McFarlane |others= |type=Special features |publisher=HBO Home Video |location= |id= |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Some of the earliest manga magazines were aimed at adults, and this provided a prime source as the basis for adult anime works. ''[[Weekly Manga Times]]'' began publication in 1956, and would be followed by ''[[Weekly Manga Goraku]]'' (1964), and ''[[Manga Action]]'' (1967). Anime works based on adult manga include ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]'', ''[[Hellsing]] Ultimate'', ''[[Maison Ikkoku]]'', ''[[Mushishi]]'', ''[[Golden Boy (manga)|Golden Boy]]'' and ''[[Tokyo Daigaku Monogatari]]''.
	 
In 1969, [[Osamu Tezuka]] and [[Eiichi Yamamoto]] released ''[[Senya Ichiya Monogatari]]'' (千夜一夜物語) the first of a series of three animated feature films aimed at an adult audience. It was dubbed and released in the United States as ''[[One Thousand and One Arabian Nights (film)|One Thousand and One Arabian Nights]]''. [[Osamu Tezuka]] and [[Eiichi Yamamoto]] collaborated on the second film in the Animerama series ''[[Kureopatora]]'' (クレオパトラ) released in the United States as ''[[Cleopatra (1970 film)|Cleopatra: Queen of Sex]]''. The third film ''[[Kanashimi no Belladonna|Kanashimi no Beradonna]]'' (哀しみのベラドンナ) was directed by [[Eiichi Yamamoto]] alone. It was entered in the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], but did not achieve commercial success.
	 
In 1984, [[original video animation]] (OVA) of an erotic nature began to be released, first ''[[Lolita Anime]]'' by Wonder Kids based on the manga work of Fumio Nakajima, and then later in the year ''[[Cream Lemon]]'', a series which proved to be a big hit in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:くりいむレモン]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[La Blue Girl]]'' and ''[[New Angel]]'' are two other erotic anime to be released in United States and Europe in the early 1990s.

1988 saw the release of ''Akira'' directed by [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] which was dubbed and shown in North American theaters, and released on [[VHS]] around the world. Its success led to a greater interest in Japanese adult anime in the US, and opened the door for other titles. In 1995, ''Ghost in the Shell'' was released as a feature film, directed by [[Mamoru Oshii]] based on the manga by [[Masamune Shirow]]. It received critical acclaim in both Japan, and abroad hinting further at the possibilities of adult animation.
	 
The North American [[Adult Swim]] channel has been airing adult-oriented anime series on Saturday nights: ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[FLCL]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'', ''[[IGPX]]'' and ''[[Space Dandy]]''. Four of the Japanese TV networks have similar late night anime blocks: [[Fuji Television]]'s ''[[Noitamina]]'', [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]]'s ''Animeism and Anime Shower'', [[Asahi Broadcasting Corporation]]'s ''Wednesday Anime'' and [[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation]]'s ''Manpa''.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:深夜アニメ]]&lt;/ref&gt; The programs aired have included ''[[Angel Heart (manga)|Angel Heart]]'', ''[[Genji Monogatari Sennenki]]'' and ''[[Hellsing]]''.

Starting in 2004, [[Mahiro Maeda]] directed a multi-episode anime adaptation of [[Alexandre Dumas]]' novel as ''[[Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo]]''. It was aired on [[Animax]] in [[Asia]], and [[FUNimation]] in the United States, and received critical acclaim in the anime press.

==History==
In 1911, [[Frederic Goudy]], [[Alfred Stieglitz]], and [[William Addison Dwiggins|W. A. Dwiggins]] came together to discuss the creation of an organization that was committed to individuals passionate about communication design.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://madmuseum.org/series/aiga|title=AIGA|website=madmuseum.org|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, president of the [[National Arts Club]], [[John G. Agar (lawyer)|John G. Agar]], announced the formation of The American Institute of Graphic Arts during the eighth annual exhibition of “The Books of the Year.” The National Arts Club was instrumental in the formation of AIGA in that they helped to form the committee to plan to organize the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/11/13/104788833.html|title=ARTS CLUB WARNED OF 'THOUGHT TRUST'; While It Plans for Graphic Arts, Bacheller Also Warns of Our Europeanization. NEW THEMES FOR NOVELS Getting Away from Work, He Finds Butcher's Daughter Cultivates Only Ease and the Graces Now.|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee formed included [[Charles DeKay]] and [[William Bailey Howland|William B. Howland]] and officially formed the American Institute of Graphic Arts in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aiga.org/How-Our-Quarter-Century-Began/|title=How Our Quarter Century Began|newspaper=AIGA {{!}} the professional association for design|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howland, publisher and editor of ''The Outlook'', was elected president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Steven Heller|author2=Nathan Gluck|title=Seventy-five years of AIGA|url=http://www.aiga.org/about-history-75thanniversary/|website=aiga.org|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the group was to promote excellence in the graphic design profession through its network of local chapters throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1920, AIGA began awarding [[List of AIGA medalists|medals]] to "individuals who have set standards of excellence over a lifetime of work or have made individual contributions to innovation within the practice of design." Winners have been recognized for design, teaching, writing or leadership of the profession and may honor individuals posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aiga.org/medal|title=AIGA Medalists List|newspaper=AIGA {{!}} the professional association for design|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the New York Chapter was formed and the organization began creating local chapters to decentralize leadership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Represented by Washington, D.C. arts advocate and attorney, James Lorin Silverberg, Esq., The Washington, D.C. Chapter of AIGA, was organized as the American Institute of Graphic Arts, Incorporated, Washington, D.C. on September 6, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=District of Columbia Corporate Records|url=http://corp.dcra.dc.gov/BizEntity.aspx/ViewEntityData?entityld=2787251|publisher=The District of Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbol sign project==
{{main article|DOT pictograms}}
The AIGA, in collaboration with the [[US Department of Transportation]], produced 50 standard symbols to be used on signs "in airports and other transportation hubs and at large international events". The first 34 symbols were published in 1974, receiving  a [[Presidential Design Award]]. The remaining 16 designs were added in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/symbol-signs|title=Symbol Signs|year=2009|publisher=AIGA|accessdate=September 2, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091010215420/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/symbol-signs| archivedate= October 10, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual competitions ==

===Cased===
In 2012, AIGA replaced all its competitions with a single competition called "Cased"&lt;ref name="Cased-competition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/cased/|title=Cased, AIGA's annual design competition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly called "Justified"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/justified/#about |title=Justified: AIGA Annual Design Competition |author=AIGA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The stated aim of the competition is to demonstrate "the collective success and impact of the design profession by celebrating the best in contemporary design through case studies".&lt;ref name="Cased-competition" /&gt;

===50 Books/50 Covers===
Between 1941 and 2011 AIGA sponsored a juried contest for the 50 best designed books published in the previous year, entitled "50 Books/50 Covers". Jurors included booksellers, book publishers, and designers such as [[George Salter]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Books of the year 1963'', The American Institute of Graphic Arts, New York, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2012, AIGA announced that it would cease organizing the contest and that future contests would be organized by [[Design Observer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/AIGA-and-Design-Observer-partner-on-50-Books-50-Covers/ |title=AIGA and Design Observer Partner on "50 Books/50 Covers" |date=February 17, 2012 |author=AIGA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This move has been criticized.&lt;ref name=Unjustified&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.printmag.com/featured/aiga-unjustified/ |title=AIGA: Unjustified |first=Paula |last=Scher |authorlink=Paula Scher |work=[[Print (magazine)|Print Magazine]] |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===365===
The 365 was an annual design competition for all graphic design other than book design.&lt;ref name=Unjustified /&gt; The last “365” competition was organized in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/about-365/ |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;365 | Design Effectiveness Competition&lt;/nowiki&gt; |author=AIGA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after which it was replaced by the "Cased" competition.

==Conferences==
AIGA organized two conferences, the AIGA Design Conference and GAIN: AIGA Design and Business Conference. Both conferences were held biennially and the two were held in alternating years. Beginning in 2016, the AIGA Design Conference will be held annually with the 2016 conference held in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designconference.aiga.org/#!/|title=AIGA Design Conference|website=designconference.aiga.org|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Brooklynite Shirin, the daughter of well-off Persian immigrants, is left homeless and jobless after her girlfriend Maxine breaks up with her. With the encouragement of her friend Crystal she moves in with strange roommates and gets a new job teaching 5 year old [[Park Slope]] children the art of movie making.

Shirin's parents are confused as to why Shirin moved out of her old apartment as Shirin has never told them she was bisexual and dating a woman. Determined to get her life back on track, Shirin begins trying to follow Maxine, hoping to rekindle their relationship. Maxine begins dating Tibet, a fellow teacher at the [[Park Slope]] school where she works.  Shirin devotes herself to her work and comes out to her brother, who is mostly supportive, and her mother, who is in denial.

On the subway, Shirin tells Crystal that she again plans to bring up the issue of her sexuality with her mother in a month. She sees Maxine outside the subway car on the platform and the two women wave to one another.

[[Image:Maciejowski Tower of Babel.jpg|thumb|right|A high medieval construction site from the [[Maciejowski Bible]].]]
'''''Artes Mechanicae''''' or '''mechanical arts''', are a medieval concept of ordered practices or skills, often juxtaposed to the traditional seven liberal arts [[Artes liberales]]. Also called "servile" and "vulgar",&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Cicero's''De Officiis'', Book I, xxlii.&lt;/ref&gt; from antiquity they had been deemed unbecoming for a free man, as ministering to baser needs.

==Overview==
[[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (9th century) divides them somewhat arbitrarily into seven parts: 
*''vestiaria'' ([[tailor]]ing, [[weaving]])
*''agricultura'' ([[agriculture]])
*''architectura'' ([[architecture]], [[masonry]])
*''militia''  and ''venatoria'' ([[war]]fare and [[hunting]], Military education, "[[martial arts]]")
*''mercatura'' ([[trade]])
*''coquinaria'' ([[cooking]])
*''metallaria'' ([[blacksmithing]], [[metallurgy]])&lt;ref&gt;In his commentary on Martianus Capella's early fifth century work, ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'', one of the main sources for medieval reflection on the liberal arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Didascalicon]]'', [[Hugh of St Victor]] (12th century) includes [[navigation]], [[medicine]] and [[theatre|theatrical arts]] instead of commerce, agriculture and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Hugues de Saint-Victor, ''Libri septem eruditiones didascaliae'', ch.26 (PL 176, col.760): lanificium, armaturum, navigationem, agriculturem, venationem, medicinam, theatricam&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh's treatment somewhat elevates the mechanical arts as ordained to the improvement of humanity, a promotion which was to represent a growing trend among late medievals.&lt;ref&gt;See Georges Legoff, ''Time, Work and Culture in the Middle Ages'', (Chicago, University of Chicago Press) 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention of Art"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shiner | first = Dr. Larry | year = 2003 | pages = 28–30 |title=[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]] |publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of the ''Artes Mechanicae'' as applied [[geometry]] was introduced to Western Europe by [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] (12th century) under the influence of his readings in Arabic scholarship.

In the 19th century "mechanic arts" referred to fields of which some are now known as [[engineering]].  Use of the term was apparently an attempt to distinguish these fields from creative and artistic endeavors like the [[performing arts]] and the [[fine arts]] which were for the upper class of the time, and the [[intelligentsia]].  The mechanic arts were also considered practical fields for those that did not come from good families.

Related phrases, "[[useful arts]]," or "applied arts" probably encompass the mechanic arts as well as craftsmanship in general.

The most famous usage of the term "mechanic arts" (and the one in which it is most commonly encountered today) is in the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4326">{{About|the literary device|"back-stories" of consumer goods|Back-story (production)|the book by [[David Mitchell (comedian)|David Mitchell]]|David Mitchell: Back Story}}
A '''backstory''', '''background story''', '''back-story''', or '''background''' is a set of events invented for a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], presented as preceding and leading up to that plot. It is a [[literary device]] of a [[narrative history]] all chronologically earlier than the narrative of primary interest. 

In [[acting]], it is the history of the [[character (arts)|character]] before the drama begins, and is created during the actor's preparation. 

It is the history of characters and other elements  that underlie the situation existing at the main narrative's start. Even a purely historical work selectively reveals backstory to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/backstory Backstory at Merriam Webster online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/backstory Backstory at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage&lt;!--'Main story' redirects here--&gt;==
As a [[literary device]], backstory is often employed to lend depth or believability to the '''main story'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. The usefulness of having a  [[Discovery (fiction)|dramatic revelation]] was recognized by [[Aristotle]], in [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']].

Backstories are usually revealed, partially or in full, chronologically or otherwise, as the main narrative unfolds. However, a story creator may also create portions of a backstory or even an entire backstory that is solely for their own use.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/08/backstory-importance-of-what-isnt-told.html Backstory: The Importance of What Isn't Told]&lt;/ref&gt;

Backstory may be revealed by various means, including [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, [[dialogue]], [[Narrative|direct narration]], [[:wikt:summary|summary]], [[recollection]], and [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]]. The original ''[[Star Wars (film) | Star Wars]]'' movie and its first two [[sequels]] are examples of a work with a preconceived backstory, which was later released as the "prequel" second set of three movies.

== Recollection ==
[[Recollection]] is the [[Fiction-writing modes|fiction-writing mode]] whereby a character calls something to mind, or remembers it. A character's memory plays a role for conveying backstory, as it allows a fiction-writer to bring forth information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story. Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct fiction-writing mode, recollection is commonly used by authors of fiction.

For example, Orson Scott Card observes that "If it's a memory the character could have called to mind at any point, having her think about it just in time to make a key decision may seem like an implausible coincidence . . . ." Furthermore, "If the memory is going to prompt a present decision, then the memory in turn must have been prompted by a recent event."&lt;ref&gt;Card, Orson Scott (1988), "Character &amp; Viewpoint", p. 113. Cincinnati, OH: Writer's Digest Books. {{ISBN|0-89879-307-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shared universe ==
In a [[shared universe]] more than one author may shape the same backstory. The later creation of a backstory that conflicts with a previously written main story may require the adjustment device known as [[retroactive continuity]], informally known as "[[retcon]]".

==Acting==
Actors may create their own backstories for characters, going beyond the sometimes meager information in a script. Filling in details helps an actor interpret the script and create fully imagined characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homan |first1=Sidney |last2=Rhinehart |first2=Brian |title=Comedy Acting for Theatre: The Art and Craft of Performing in Comedies |date=2018 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=9781350012783 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMVIDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=backstory+acting&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=26 November 2018 |chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
Basenotes has won five awards for its editorial content at [[The Canadian Fragrance Awards]] in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsblaze.com/story/2007050310040200005.cc/topstory.html Coty Canada, Prestilux Inc., Estee Lauder and Lancome: Big Winners At The 2007 Canadian Fragrance Awards-Shelley Rozenwald Awarded Lifetime Achievement Award&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://nowsmellthis.blogharbor.com/blog/_archives/2008/4/26/3661406.html German Duftstars, Canadian Fragrance Awards ~ the 2008 winners :: Now Smell This&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720183111/http://nowsmellthis.blogharbor.com/blog/_archives/2008/4/26/3661406.html |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2009. All three of these winning articles were written by Marian Bendeth, a regular contributor and fragrance expert.

In 2009, the website won a prize for Best Web Editorial at the [[Jasmine Awards]] for an article by the writer, Liz Upton. The following year, the same prize was won by the Basenotes writer, Walker Minton. In 2018, Claire Vukcevic won the Best Practical Guide Award for her guide to summer fragrances on Basenotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thejasmineawards.co.uk/the-fragrance-foundation-jasmine-awards-2018-winners|title=The Fragrance Foundation Jasmine Awards 2018 Winners {{!}} The Jasmine Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=thejasmineawards.co.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.basenotes.net/features/3482-summer-fragrances-for-people-who-hate-summer-and-also-summer-fragrances|title=Summer Fragrances for People Who Hate Summer &amp; Also Summer Fragrances ~ by Claire Vukcevic — Basenotes.net|last=|first=|date=|website=www.basenotes.net|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, Basenotes was one of 50 websites recommended by ''[[Men's Vogue]]'' in a best-of-the-web round-up which also featured [[IMDB]], [[Slashdot]], [[Boing Boing]] and [[eLuxury]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mensvogue.com/design/articles/best_websites_hub 50 Recommended Web sites: Tech: mensvogue.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080811192318/http://www.mensvogue.com/design/articles/best_websites_hub |date=11 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Much suspicion surrounds the censorship process on the site, whereby opinions which differ from the orthodoxy as presented by the site moderators are removed. Frequently, this results in the banning of members who express non-compliant views. It has been suggested that there are commercial motives behind this censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://basenotessucks.blogspot.co.uk|title=No To Basenotes Censorship|last=|first=|date=|website=basenotessucks.blogspot.co.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragrance house O'Driu, who apparently suffered as a result of this perceived  bias, famously responded by releasing a fragrance called "Basenotes Kiss My Ass", which won an award at the Cafleurebon 2015 fragrance awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cafleurebon.com/cafleurebon-best-and-worst-perfumes-of-2015-best-fragrance-best-perfumer-and-hall-of-fame-draw|title=best fragrances of 2015|last=|first=|date=2015-12-27|work=Cafleurebon - Perfume and Beauty Blog|access-date=28 May 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bogan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|ɡ|ən}} {{respell|BOHG|ən}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=bogan noun - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes {{!}} Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bogan|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com|accessdate=26 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is [[Australian English|Australian]] and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] [[slang]] for a person whose speech, clothing, attitude and behaviour are considered unrefined or unsophisticated. Depending on the context, the term can be pejorative or [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Lauder| first=Simon| title=Bogan Pl residents lobby for name change| publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]| date=12 April 2008| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/12/2215081.htm| accessdate=12 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of the term bogan has also been associated with changing social attitudes towards [[social class]] in Australia. Specifically, the term has been related to the decline of masculine conceptions of meritocracy in Australia, and a growing ambivalence towards traditional sites of [[working class]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;Paternoster, H.J., Warr, D. and Jacobs, K., 2018.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term ''bogan'' is unclear; both the ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' and the ''[[Australian Oxford Dictionary]]'' cite the origin as unknown.&lt;ref name="newsOxf"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bogan breaks into Oxford dictionary|publisher=News Limited|date=19 June 2012|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/bogan-breaks-into-oxford-dictionary/story-fncvfxcm-1226400724944|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Sydney residents' recollection is that the term is based on the concept that residents of the Western Suburbs (stereotyped as "Westies") displayed what are now termed "bogan" characteristics and that an individual who displayed these characteristics to a strong extent was as "west" as the Bogan River in western New South Wales. According to another anecdote, the term emerged in [[Melbourne]]'s outer-western and outer-eastern suburbs in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name="newsDM"&gt;{{cite web |title=Don't call us uncouth say 'Bogans': Anger as Australian term similar to 'Chav' is included in Oxford Dictionary|last=Miller |first=Daniel|work=[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail Australia]] |date=21 June 2012 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2162191/Bogan-fury-Anger-Australian-term-similar-Chav-included-Oxford-Dictionary.html |accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term became widely known in the late 1980s when the teenage character Kylie Mole (played by [[Mary-Anne Fahey]]), in the Australian [[sketch comedy]] television series ''[[The Comedy Company]]'', frequently used the term to disparage anyone she disliked.&lt;ref name="ANDC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andc.anu.edu.au/australian-words/meanings-origins?field_alphabet_value=71 |title=Meanings and origins of Australian words and idioms |publisher=Australian National Dictionary Centre |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same program included a sketch about a magazine called ''Bogue'' (a parody of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''), which featured traditional bogans. [[Merrick and Rosso]] (from Melbourne) also used the term on their [[Triple J]] national radio show.

The [[Australian National Dictionary Centre]] (ANDC) included the word in its Australian dictionary project&lt;ref name="ANDC"/&gt; in 1991 and said the earliest use they found was in the September 1985 issue of surfing magazine ''[[Tracks (magazine)|Tracks]]'': "So what if I have a [[Mohawk hairstyle|Mohawk]] and wear [[Dr. Martens]] (boots for all you uninformed bogans)?"&lt;ref name="ANDC" /&gt;

There are places in western [[New South Wales]] that contain ''bogan'' in their name—for example [[Bogan Shire]], the [[Bogan River]] and the rural village of [[Bogan Gate]]. Bogan Gate, for example, is derived from the local Aboriginal word meaning "the birthplace of a notable headman of the local tribe".&lt;ref name="ANDC"/&gt; Residents of streets such as Bogan Place and Bogan Road have been moved to action by the negative connotations of their street names and lobbied to rename them, prompting [[Ku-ring-gai]] mayor Nick Ebbeck to joke that he was a bit of a bogan himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23533259-5013110,00.html |title=Not the place for bogans |work=Daily Telegraph |date=14 April 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2009|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416154534/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23533259-5013110,00.html|archive-date=16 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1902 poem "City of Dreadful Thirst" by Australian poet [[Banjo Paterson]] makes reference to a "Bogan shower" as a term meaning "three raindrops and some dust", although this is likely a reference to the dry area around the Bogan River. Makeshift gates in a rural fence in northwest NSW were known as ''bogan gates'' at least as early as the 1960s.

Some features regularly associated with the bogan stereotype include residing in the outer suburbs of larger cities, having teeth that haven't had dental care due to cost, having an anti-authoritarian or jingoistic stance, as well as being interested in classic rock music, [[hooning|hoon driving]] and excessive alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name="bogans"&gt;{{cite web |title=Do bogans know they’re bogans?

Certain types of clothing are stereotypically associated with bogans, including [[flannel]]ette shirts, hoodies, [[Stubbies (brand)|Stubbies]] shorts, [[Pacific Brands|King Gee]] workwear, [[ugg boots]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Katz |first=Danny |title=The uggly side of life |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/danny-katz/the-uggly-side-of-life/2006/09/27/1159337216912.html |work=The Age |accessdate=6 March 2014 |date=27 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[jeans]] and black [[leggings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Demasi |first=Laura |title=Anatomy of a trend - leggings |date=5 October 2006&lt;!--guessed from URL--&gt; |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/fashion/anatomy-of-a-trend--leggings/2006/10/05/1159641427417.html |work=The Age |accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vehicles such as the [[Holden Commodore]] and [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]], particularly modified or poorly maintained examples, also have similar associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bogan.com.au/definition/index.php |title=Definition |publisher=BOGAN.com.au |accessdate=28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person described as a bogan may refuse to conform to middle-class standards of taste, dietary habits, leisure activities, styles of dress and ways of speaking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bogans and hipsters: we’re talking the living language of class |url=http://theconversation.com/bogans-and-hipsters-were-talking-the-living-language-of-class-23007 |publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=8 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and might be looked down upon by some groups due to preconceived perceptions and biases which can often make the lives of disadvantaged people much tougher.&lt;ref name="biases"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/bogans-from-the-burbs-confronting-our-hidden-biases-11661|title=Bogans from the ‘burbs: confronting our hidden biases|date=8 February 2013|publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mel Campbell]] argued in a 2006 article in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' that bogan (including "cashed-up bogan") is a nebulous, personal concept that is frequently used in a process by which "we use the idea of the bogan to quarantine ideas of Australianness that alarm or discomfort us. It's a way of erecting imaginary cultural barriers between 'us' and 'them'." Campbell argues that though many people believe they know exactly what a bogan is and what their characteristics might be, there is no defined set of characteristics of a bogan: the speaker imagines the denoted person to be different from, and less cultured than, themselves. Campbell considered "cashed-up bogan" to be a "stupid term".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Campbell|first=Mel|title=Perhaps there's a little bogan in everyone |work=Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax |date=8 June 2006|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/perhaps-theres-a-little-bogan-in-everyone/2006/06/07/1149359814143.html|accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar argument is made by David Nichols, author of ''The Bogan Delusion'' (2011), who says that people have "created this creature that is a lesser human being to express their interclass hatred".&lt;ref&gt;Chris Johnston, [http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/class-war-festers-in-hated-bogan-zeroes-20110603-1flc7.html Class war festers in hated bogan zeroes], ''The Age'', 4 June 2011.

==Non-pejorative usage==
By the 21st century, the term bogan came to be employed more favourably to indicate a pride in being rough around the edges. In 2002, Michelle Griffin discussed the fact that 'bogan' is no longer just being used as an insult, but is in fact a way to identify with the 'Aussie' culture that many Anglo‐Saxon Australian citizens are proud of.&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt; In the past, bogan was a term of disdain, but nowadays it has become 'cool' to be a bogan.&lt;ref name="bogans"/&gt; Radio station [[Triple J]] held a "National Bogan Day" on 28 June 2002, which they commemorated by playing music by rock bands such as [[Cold Chisel]], [[Midnight Oil]], [[Rose Tattoo]] and [[AC/DC]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Michelle: [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/07/15/1026185158244.html Bogansville: meet the new in-crowd], ''[[The Age]]'', 16 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 study, [[linguistics]] students at the [[University of Auckland]] found that the term was likely to be thought of as positive by people under the age of 30, compared with over-30s who generally felt it was more of a negative term.&lt;ref name="newsOxf"/&gt;

==Representation==

===Television===
The typical bogan has been portrayed on television in shows such as ''[[Outrageous Fortune (TV series)|Outrageous Fortune]]'', ''[[Bogan Hunters]]'', ''[[Pizza (TV series)|Pizza]]'', ''[[Housos]]'', ''[[Bogan Pride]]'', ''[[Kath &amp; Kim (Australian TV series)|Kath &amp; Kim]]'', and ''[[Upper Middle Bogan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our fascination with ‘bogans’ will be televised |url=http://theconversation.com/our-fascination-with-bogans-will-be-televised-25262 |publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=8 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
In the 2016 film ''[[Suicide Squad (2016 film)|Suicide Squad]]'', DC Comics villain [[Captain Boomerang]]—a classically Australian character—has been reinvented as a bogan instead of his typical garish personality.

===Internet===
The popular website (and 2010 bestselling book) ''[[Things Bogans Like]]'' contains 250 articles on various things that bogans are claimed to like, and suggests that a "bogan today defies income, class, race, creed, gender and logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bogans Like|first=Things|title=What is a Bogan Today? |work=Things Bogans Like |publisher=Hachette Australia |date=October 2010| url=http://thingsboganslike.com/about/| accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Microsoft deemed ''bogan'' to be one of twenty colloquialisms most relevant to Australian users when the word was added to the dictionary of [[Microsoft Office]] 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Press release: [http://www.microsoft.com/australia/presspass/post/Strewth!-Microsoft-Office-2007-will-recognise-more-dinky-di-words Strewth! Microsoft Office 2007 will recognise more dinky-di words], [[Microsoft Corporation]], 15 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The word entered the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' in June 2012.

The word ''bogan'' attracts negative attention online towards Anglo-Australians, and consequently [http://www.Boganbroadcast.com boganbroadcast] is actively campaigning to reclaim the term in a positive way.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boganbroadcast.com/?page_id=2|title=about bogan broadcast|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=6/9/2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apps===
An app known as "The Bogan Test" has been created to examine a person's likelihood to fall within the boundaries of the bogan category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=You're a bogan too. Just take this test. |url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/youre-a-bogan-too-just-take-this-test/story-fnet0he2-1226629950573 |publisher=News Limited |date=27 December 2013 |accessdate=8 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Australian [[ska-punk]] band [[Area-7]] achieved one of their biggest hits with the song "Nobody Likes A Bogan", released in 2002.

==Use in marketing==
"CUB" or "cashed up bogan", was used by one marketing researcher in 2006 to describe people of a blue-collar background [[Nouveau riche|now earning a high salary]] and spending their earnings on expensive consumer items as a matter of [[conspicuous consumption]]. The media have cited [[tennis]] player [[Lleyton Hewitt]] and his actress wife, [[Bec Cartwright]], as examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/05/19/1147545524374.html |title=Snobbery alert: the 'Cub' is busy turning Melbourne into Boganville|work=Age |publisher=Fairfax |date=20 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Kaesler Winery, in the [[Barossa Valley wine district|Barossa Valley]], released a Shiraz wine under the name Bogan.

==Regional equivalent terms==
Roz Rohen has described the term 'bogan' as peerless, and that it warrants acceptance as an Australian keyword.&lt;ref name="Phd"&gt;{{cite web |title=Take our word for it: The Aussie Bogan is "in" |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/questnews/east/take-our-word-for-it-the-aussie-bogan-is-in/story-fni9r0lo-1226763717481?nk=ed31c832430883f38db9da0aeaea89eb |publisher=[[The Courier-Mail|Courier Mail]] |date=20 November 2013 |accessdate=8 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term "bogan" is understood across Australia and New Zealand, certain regions have their own slang terms for the same group of people. These terms include:

* "Bevan" or "Bev" in [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smitz|first=Paul|title=Lonely Planet Australia|year=2004|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-447-9|page=1064}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Booner" in [[Canberra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ozwords.org/?p=3964 |title=Canberra Word: booner|work=Ozwords|publisher=Australian National Dictionary Centre|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://the-riotact.com/what-has-happened-to-canberra's-booners/9862 |title=What has happened to Canberra’s booners?|work=RiotACT|date=28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Chigger" (also "chigga" or "chig") in [[Tasmania]]. This appears to be a reference to the Hobart suburb of [[Chigwell, Tasmania|Chigwell]].&lt;ref name="BBSB" /&gt;
* "Scozza" in [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia.&lt;ref name="BBSB" /&gt;

"[[Westie (person)|Westie]]" or "westy" is not synonymous with bogan, although westies are often stereotyped as being bogans. "Westie" predates bogan,&lt;ref name="BBSB"/&gt; originating in [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]] in the 1970s to refer to people from that city's western suburbs. As Sydney's western suburbs are predominantly working class blue collar areas, the term connotes a predominantly working class blue collar person – someone with little education, little taste, and very limited horizons. "Westie" is now in wide use in many cities and towns across both Australia and New Zealand, where it especially refers to the denizens of West Auckland.

'''''Boğdan Sarayi''''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]] for "Palace of Bogdania ([[Moldavia]])") was an [[Eastern Orthodox]] church in [[Turkey]]'s largest city, [[Istanbul]]. Erected in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]], its original dedication is unknown. In the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman era]] the small edifice, being dedicated to [[St. Nicholas]] of [[Myra]], was known as '''''Agios Nikólaos tou Bogdansarághi''''' ({{lang-gr|Ἅγιος Νικόλαος τοῦ Βογδανσαράγι}}).&lt;ref name=ja384&gt;Janin (1953), p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mw108&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the Istanbul residence of the Moldavian ''[[hospodar]]''′s legation to the [[Ottoman Porte]].&lt;ref name=ja384/&gt;&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt; The building - whose parts above ground have almost completely disappeared - is a minor example of [[Byzantine architecture]] in [[Constantinople]].

==History==
===Byzantine Age===
[[File:Hagios Nikolaos.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The chapel viewed from northeast in a drawing of 1877, from A.G. Paspates' ''Byzantine topographical studies'']]
The building was erected on the slope of the [[Seven hills of Istanbul|sixth hill of Constantinople]] which overlooks the [[Golden Horn]]. Nothing is known about the edifice in the Byzantine Age, but due to its position it was likely an annex of the monastery of ''[[St. John the Baptist]] in the Rock'' ({{lang-gr|Ἅγιος Ιωάννης Πρόδρομος ἐν τῇ Πὲτρα}}, pr. "Hagios Ioannis Prodromos en ti Petra"), one of the largest monasteries of Constantinople, where, among other [[relics]], the [[Arma Christi|instruments]] of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of [[Christ]] were kept.&lt;ref name=ja385&gt;Janin (1953), p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, due to its small dimensions it is not likely that the building was the ''[[katholikon]]'' (main church) of the monastery.&lt;ref name=ja385/&gt; According to some sources it was erected in twelfth century, during the [[Komnenoi|Komnenian]] age,&lt;ref name=ja384/&gt;&lt;ref name =ma255&gt;Mamboury (1953), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; while for others it is a [[Palaiologos|Palaiologan]] foundation of the fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt; Its north-south orientation shows that it was originally erected not as a church, but rather as a funerary chapel.&lt;ref name=ja384/&gt;&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt;

===Ottoman Age===
After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Ottomans in 1453, in sixteenth century the chapel became part of the large land estate bought by the ''[[hospodar]]'' of [[Moldavia]] to host his envoys in Istanbul, and named accordingly ''Boğdan [[Saray (building)|Saray]]i'' ("Moldavian Palace").&lt;ref name=ja384/&gt;&lt;ref name =ma255/&gt; In this respect, its usage as private chapel of a patrician house represents a rarity in the Ottoman city. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the complex - a coveted property because the high border wall protected it by fires - was leased by the [[Sultan]] as residence for several foreign envoys, among them the Swedish ambassadors to the Ottoman Porte P. Strasburg and C. Rolomb, who sojourned in Istanbul in 1634 and 1657/58 respectively.&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt; In June 1760 the [[Phanariote]] John Callimaches endowed it to the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] monastery of [[Agiou Panteleimonos monastery|St. Pantaleon]] on [[Mount Athos]].&lt;ref name=ja385/&gt; The complex burned down in the fire of 1784, and afterward the land was only used as a market garden.&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt;  The possession of the church by the Athos monastery was confirmed again by relatives of Callimaches in January 1795 and August 1814, but the Russian monks showed little interest in the church's restoration, possibly because of the [[Russo-Turkish Wars|state of war]] between the [[Russian Empire]] and the Sublime Porte.&lt;ref name=ja385/&gt; In the nineteenth century the edifice steadily decayed and after the [[1894 Istanbul earthquake]] fell into ruin. In 1918 a German archaeologist pursued clandestine excavations and found in the crypt three unnamed tombs.&lt;ref name=ja385/&gt; In the second half of the 20th century the remains of the building were enclosed in a shanty ({{lang-tr|[[Gecekondu]]}}), and today—lying inside a tire shop—they are hardly accessible.&lt;ref name=ki17&gt;King (1999), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 the parts above ground have almost disappeared, and only the crypt still exists.&lt;ref name=ja385/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Bogdan saray 01.jpg|right|250px|thumb|View of the building's remains in 1908, showing the brickwork pattern.]]
The edifice had a rectangular plan, with sides of 6.20 m and 3.50 m,&lt;ref name=ja384/&gt; and was originally composed of two storeys, consisting of an above ground chapel and a subterranean [[crypt]].&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt; The chapel was surmounted by a dome with [[pendentive]]s insisting on two transverse arches across the walls, and ended towards North with a [[Bema]] and a polygonal [[apse]] adorned externally with niches, while the crypt was surmounted by a [[barrel vault]] and had also a simple apse.&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt;  The edifice's  [[brickwork]] consisted of courses of three or four rows of white stones alternating with a row of red [[brick]]s, obtaining a chromatic effect typical of the late Byzantine period. Its north-south orientation suggests the building's use as a funerary chapel, rather than as a church, since churches in Constantinople were almost always oriented in east-west direction.&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt; The attested past existence of remains of walls perpendicular to the structure indicates the possibility that this was part of a larger complex, most likely the monastery of St. John of Petra, one of the largest monasteries of Constantinople.&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt;

{{Western dress codes}}
'''Business casual''' is an ambiguously defined [[dress code]] adopted by some [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] workplaces in [[Western world|Western countries]], comprising more [[casual wear]] than [[informal wear]] ("dress clothes"), but less casual than [[smart casual]].

Widespread acceptance of business casual attire was preceded by [[Casual Friday]]s which originated [[California]], [[United States]], in the 1990s, in turn inspired by the [[Hawaii]]an 1960s casual custom of [[Aloha Friday]].&lt;ref name="BrownArthur2002"&gt;Brown &amp; Arthur 2002, p. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HopeTozian2002"&gt;Hope &amp; Tozian 2000, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
There is no generally agreed definition of "business casual".  One definition of business casual states that it includes [[khaki]] pants, [[slacks]], and [[skirts]], as well as short-sleeved [[polo shirt]]s  and long-sleeved shirts, but excludes jeans, tennis shoes, tight or short skirts, T-shirts, and sweatshirts.&lt;ref name="Interviewing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/csc/undergraduate/interviewing.shtml|title = Interviewing {{!}} Career Services Center {{!}} Marquette University| website = Marquette University Career Services Center | accessdate = 26 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906180709/http://www.marquette.edu//csc/undergraduate/interviewing.shtml |archive-date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source, an American university careers service, states that business casual consists of neutral colors more towards the dark shades of black, gray, navy, but can include white and off white, and reminds that the clothing should be pressed and have clean, crisp seams.&lt;ref name="Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"&gt;{{cite web|title=Business casual attire|url=http://www.career.vt.edu/JobSearchGuide/BusinessCasualAttire.html#ATTIREMENWOMEN|publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Dress for Success" advice from the University of Toronto sums up business casual as "a classic, clean cut, and put together look where a full suit is not required," which means slacks, khakis, or skirts; [[blouse]]s, polo shirts, or shirts with collar but no [[necktie]]; some [[sweaters]]; and closed-toe shoes.&lt;ref name=UTM/&gt; The Canadian university ends with the warning that "it is not clothing you would wear to a club or for athletic purposes.... Don’t let the word casual mislead you. You still need to look professional."&lt;ref name=UTM&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/careers/business-formal-professional-or-business-casual | title = Business formal/professional or business casual? | publisher = [[University of Toronto Mississauga]] | accessdate = 28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another author wrote in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' that "Ordinarily business casual for guys seems fairly clear. It is a pair of [[chinos]], a [[blazer]] and a good shirt, no tie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/5eec3cd6-8bf2-11e0-854c-00144feab49a.html#axzz2kbppAQhD|title=Why business casual makes me smart|last=Shrimsley|first=Robert|date=3 June 2011|work=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[BBC]] article suggested that a "safe global standard" consists of "a button down shirt," "jackets or blazers, khaki or gray slacks, and leather shoes."&lt;ref name=BBC-2011&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20111118-business-casual-attire-around-the-world | date = 22 November 2011 | title = ‘Business casual’ attire around the world | work = BBC Business | first = Chris | last = McGinnis | publisher = [[BBC]] | accessdate = 28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It warned, however, that great variation exists between countries and regions within countries.&lt;ref name=BBC-2011/&gt; A U.S. menswear retailer advises men to wear a collared shirt, chinos, navy blazer, and brown shoes, while making sure to look "clean and well-groomed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.paulfredrick.com/2010/05/25/rules/10-tips-for-todays-business-casual-wardrobe | title = 10 Tips for Today’s Business Casual Wardrobe | publisher = Paul Fredrick | location = Fleetwood | accessdate = 11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributor to ''[[Forbes]]'' asked her Facebook friends to define business casual, and found a slightly more casual apparent consensus not forcibly including a jacket: "For men: trousers/khakis and a shirt with a collar. For women: trousers/knee-length skirt and a blouse or shirt with a collar. No jeans. No athletic wear." A response to that was "I disagree. No khakis." She states that "there’s a lack of consensus in what actually defines a business casual wardrobe. All most people know is they don’t want to see too much of a colleague’s body, including feet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/reneesylvestrewilliams/2012/05/09/what-is-business-casual/|title=What is Business Casual?|last=Sylvestre-Williams|first=Renee|date=9 May 2012|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Byzantine Fresco Chapel''' is a part of the [[Menil Collection]] in [[Houston, Texas]], near the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]]. From February 1997 to February 2012, it displayed the only intact [[Byzantine]] [[frescoes]] of this size and importance in the entire western hemisphere. The Byzantine frescoes had been taken from the church of [[Church of Saint Evphemianos, Lysi|St. Evphemianos]] in [[Lysi]], [[Cyprus]] in the 1980s. In September 2011, the collection announced that the frescos would be permanently returned to Cyprus in February 2012, following the conclusion of a long-term loan agreement with the [[Church of Cyprus|Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903703604576587072924927678 "From Texas at Age 700"]. ''Wall Street Journal'', September 24, 2011. Retrieved January 8, 2017. {{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frescoes had been presented at the museum by agreement with the Church of Cyprus, their owners, but the church decided not to extend the loan further. They will not return to their original home as Lysi is now in [[Northern Cyprus]], but will be displayed at the Byzantine Museum in [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://houston.culturemap.com/newsdetail/09-23-11-20-43-menil-returning-byzantine-frescoes-to-cypress/ "See them while you can: Menil returning Byzantine frescoes to Cyprus in February 2012"]. ''Houston Culturemap'', September 23, 2011. Retrieved September 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, 2012, the Byzantine Fresco Chapel closed, but re-opened in 2015 for the first in a series of site-specific projects.

==History==
The chapel was opened in February 1997, and displayed masterworks from the 13th century—a dome with [[Christ Pantocrator]] and an [[apse]] depicting the [[Virgin Mary]] the [[Panayia]]. The frescoes had been stolen from a chapel near Lysi in the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish-occupied]] section of [[Cyprus]] in the 1980s, cut into 38 pieces, and shipped to Germany by thieves to sell them in the arts black-market.&lt;ref name="Slessor, Christine 1998"&gt;Slessor, Christine. "Out of this world&amp;nbsp;– Chapel Museum, Houston, Texas&amp;nbsp;– Glass and Transparency." ''The Architectural Review''. May, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The 38 fresco fragments were bought from the thieves by the Houston-based Menil Foundation on behalf of the Church of Cyprus, the rightful owner of the frescoes. The Menil Foundation then funded a careful restoration of the paintings.&lt;ref name="Menil Collection website"&gt;[https://www.menil.org/exhibitions/226-byzantine-fresco-chapel Byzantine Fresco Chapel]. ''www.menil.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; These intact frescoes were unique in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Menil Collection website" /&gt;

==The original collection==
[[File:Lysi-dome.jpg|thumb|left|Dome from church in Lysi, Cyprus depicting Christ the Pantokrator]]
The major part of the collection consisted of the frescoes of the dome and apse. According to the guide to the museum, "the Lysi dome represents Christ Pantokrator, 'All sovereign'. It defines a space with no beginning and no end."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Guide to the Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of Christ gazing directly forward "has driven time out of space. His gaze is transworldly: not looking but all-seeing."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; By not depicting the Lord below the bust, he is "universal and ubiquitous."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Surrounding the figure of Christ is a double row of angels moving towards the throne prepared by God the Father for the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. The throne is guarded by the [[Archangel Michael]] and [[Archangel Gabriel]] and two [[seraphim]]. The [[Virgin Mary]] leads one line of angels to the throne, while [[John the Baptist]] leads the other.

In the apse, the Virgin was depicted as flanked by the two archangels with a medallion on her breast of the infant Christ, symbolizing the [[Incarnation]] of Christ.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Later exhibits==

==Architecture==
[[File:ByzantineChapelMuseum.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Church within a Museum; the glass and wood chapel that housed the only intact Byzantine frescoes in the Western hemisphere]]
The {{convert|4000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} $4 million building was designed by architect [[François de Menil]]. The interior combines rough stone, opaque glass, and rich woods, to create a space that is both art museum and spiritual space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonmuseumdistrict.org/default/museumpages/museumpage.asp?MID=15 "Byzantine Fresco Chapel"]. ''Houston Museum District''. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208080959/http://www.houstonmuseumdistrict.org/default/museumpages/museumpage.asp?MID=15 |date=February 8, 2012}}. Retrieved January 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The suspended-glass "walls" are not replicas of the chapel that the frescoes were removed from, but created a new context for displaying the icons. In order not to simply replicate the original chapel, de Menil designed "a mediating external building with an embedded steel structure&amp;nbsp;– a 'reliquary box'&amp;nbsp;– which forms a neutral enclosure for a freestanding chapel," according to Christine Slessor in ''The Architectural Review''.&lt;ref name="Slessor, Christine 1998" /&gt;

{{quote|"The Byzantine Chapel Museum is a religious building whose purpose is to restore spiritual significance and function to two thirteenth-century Byzantine Frescoes, a dome and an apse, rescued and restored by the owner ... The materiality of the original chapel is shattered and made ephemeral through the fragmented, freestanding sandblasted laminated glass structure which is an abstracted evocation of the original chapel. The infinite is evoked through the play of darkness and light." François de Menil, May 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dupont.com/safetyglass/lgn/stories/0802.html "Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum uses sandblasted laminated glass to restore spiritual significance"]. ''Laminated Glass News'', E.I. Dupont de Nemours Company. August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Byzantine chapel is oriented to face the cardinal directions&amp;nbsp;– the facades face directly north, south, east and west. The enclosed space measures approximately {{convert|116000|cuft|m3}}. There are no windows on the surface area of the building, except for a skylight of {{convert|1012|sqft|m2}} of clear, double glazed glass, which permits natural light to pervade the interior.&lt;ref&gt;Allan V.

'''Casavant Frères Ltée. Opus 1841''' is a [[pipe organ]] [[Organ building|built]] by the famous [[Casavant Frères]] of [[Saint-Hyacinthe]], [[Quebec]]. The organ was first completed in 1911 as '''Casavant Brothers - Opus 452''' for '''St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church''' at 40 Bentinck Street, [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. '''St. Andrew's''' later became '''St. Andrew's United Church''' and is now the '''[[Highland Arts Theatre]]'''.

'''Opus 1841''' is presently composed of 33 [[organ stop|speaking stops]] spread over three [[Manual (music)|manuals]]  and [[Pedal keyboard|pedals]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original specification was for three manuals, 4 divisions, 29 stops, 27 registers, 29 ranks, 1843 pipes. A Stoplist for the 1911 instrument copied from the factory specifications for '''Casavant Opus 452''' 1911 3/29, courtesy of the Casavant Frères Archives, St. Hyacinthe, Québec, Canada is available by following this link: [http://database.organsociety.org/SingleOrganDetails.php?OrganID=48983 Original Stoplist]

The organ was rebuilt, including electrification, in 1946 by Casavant Frères Ltée. as '''Opus 1841''', at a cost of $7,600.00.  Work included three new Choir stops, a new traditional style [[Organ console|console]] with [[Rolltop desk|roll top]], three manuals, 4 divisions, 33 stops, 30 registers, 32 ranks, 2045 pipes. Manual compass is 61 notes, pedal compass is 32 notes. Equipped with [[Electro-pneumatic action|electro-pneumatic (EP)]] chests, drawknobs in vertical rows on angled jambs, [[Expression pedal#Balanced swell pedal|balanced swell shoes/pedals]] at standard [[American Guild of Organists|AGO placement]], adjustable [[Combination action|combination pistons]], AGO Standard (concave radiating) pedalboard, reversible full organ/tutti toe stud, combination action thumb pistons, combination action toe studs, coupler reversible thumb pistons, coupler reversible toe studs.

In 1962 further work was undertaken, the Clarion 4' replaced the Vox Humana, the Trompette 8' replaced the Cornopean, &amp; the Hooded Harmonic Trumpet replaced an earlier Trumpet on the Great Organ, with tonal changes (new pipework supplied) made by Casavant via Ledoux &amp; MacDonald Organ Service Co., Halifax. [[Pipe organ#Wind system|Wind]] is supplied by a 3 [[Horsepower|hp]] electric [[Centrifugal fan|blower]] located in the basement directly below the organ.

The 18-ton organ underwent $15,000 in repairs to its bellows in 2008, with the sheep skin seams being replaced by rubberized bellows cloth. The repairs were undertaken by Maritime Pipe Organ Builders Ltd. of [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]].&lt;ref name = "Famed church organ getting a five-figure overhaul"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tubular chimes in the Swell Organ, now disconnected, were donated in about 1929 by the Lady's Aid group of the Church. They were activated by an electro-pneumatic action and were dis-connected from the wind supply during repairs to the bellows.

In February 2017 [[Pipe organ tuning|Organ Tuner]] Jean-François Mailhot of Sydney Mines spent a week refurbishing Opus 1841, revoicing the reed stops (cleaning the reed tongues and shallots) of the swell organ: the 8' Trompette, the 8' Oboe, and the 4' Clarion, as well as the 16' Trombone of the Pedal Organ.  At this time he also repaired a damaged facade pipe, part of the 8' Open Diapason stop of the Great Organ.

While still serving as a church, St. Andrew's was considered to be perhaps the finest concert venue in the city of Sydney. Before its rebirth as an arts centre, the building had a distinguished background as a performance space. St. Andrew's Choir presented many [[cantata]]s over the years and massed [[choir]]s from eight of Sydney's churches assembled in St. Andrew's to sing as individual choirs and as a group the new and old Christmas carols. Radio broadcasts of  Classical musicians regularly held recitals and concerts there over the years because of the building's outstanding [[Architectural acoustics|acoustical properties]] and its Casavant Freres organ.&lt;ref name = "Cape Breton Post, Curtain ready to rise on new Sydney performance space"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 1950s St. Andrew's was a regular stop for one of the incarnations of the [[Symphony Nova Scotia|Halifax Symphony Orchestra]] whose performances at St. Andrew's were broadcast regionally and even nationally by [[CBC Radio]]. Thomas Mayer was the conductor.  He would often invite local performers to join them, at the time there were several [[Soprano|operatic sopranos]] and [[mezzo-soprano]]s from Cape Breton who gained a national following because of these broadcasts.  More recently, due to its seating capacity of over 1,000, and excellent acoustics it was sought after by organizations such as [[Celtic Colours]], [[The Barra MacNeils]],&lt;ref name = "Cathedral marks a new journey for Barra MacNeils"&gt;{{cite web

'''''Christmastide Divination''''' ({{lang-ru|"Святочное гадание"}}) is a painting by Russian artist [[Konstantin Makovsky]] from around 1905. The painting shows a moonlit Russian folk divination during [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christmastide]] (''svyatki'') in a rural [[log house]] (''[[izba]]''). Five out of seven depicted women gathered around a [[rooster]] pecking the grain, the [[alectryomancy]] which foretells a marriage in the near future.&lt;ref name="culture"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://vm1.culture.ru/muzey_istorii_religii/catalog/small/0002500424/|title=Картина "Святочное гадание"|publisher=Vm1.culture.ru| language=Russian| accessdate =13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls count the grains pecked by the rooster, watching if he did not peck more than twelve.&lt;ref name="hp"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.hudojnik-peredvijnik.ru/makovskij-k-e/makovskij-k-e-svyatochnye-gadaniya/|title=Маковский К.Е.

'''Cindy Beale''' (also '''Williams''') is a fictional character from the [[BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Michelle Collins]] who made her first appearance on 10 May 1988 before leaving in 1990, returning in 1992 and making her final appearance on 10 April 1998.

Cindy always has an eye for the lotharios of Walford and despite trying to settle down repeatedly with the more reliable [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), she is unable to remain faithful to him. She has a selfish streak, often more concerned about her own needs than her family's. She often lies and schemes, particularly where men are concerned.

==Storylines==
[[File:Cindy222.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Cindy as she appeared in 1990.]]
Cindy arrives in [[Albert Square]] in May 1988, working on her mother's market stall selling hats. She dates barman [[Simon Wicks]] ([[Nick Berry]]), who is also seeing [[Donna Ludlow]] ([[Matilda Ziegler]]), leading Cindy and Donna to fight for Simon's attention. However, Cindy grows tired of Simon's womanising, and despite his feelings for her, she moves on to [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), who is becoming a successful entrepreneur. Initially she only wants to make Simon jealous but she and Ian start dating and by February 1989, they announce their engagement. Meanwhile, Simon retaliates by reconciling with [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]). However, while working together late one night at [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Cindy and Simon have sex and Cindy becomes pregnant. She suggests leaving Ian for Simon but he refuses, not wanting to be tied down or upset his family so Cindy marries Ian, letting him think he is the baby's father, giving birth to [[Steven Beale|Steven]] in December 1989. However, Simon decides he wants to be a father to his son and convinces Cindy to leave Ian, devastating him with the news that Steven is not his son and a feud erupts when he realises Simon is the father. Ian's behaviour grows erratic; after attempting suicide and failing, he chooses to ruin Simon's life instead so Simon decides to leave Walford with Cindy and Steven, leaving Ian heartbroken.

In 1992, Ian discovers that Simon has abandoned Cindy and Steven. Ian persuades her to return to Walford so he can help her bring Steven up. They reunite and Cindy gets pregnant in 1993. [[Richard Cole (EastEnders)|Richard Cole]] ([[Ian Reddington]]) is romantically interested in Cindy but she rejects him, so Richard tells people that he is the father of her twins. Everyone believes him, and Ian and Cindy almost separate but the truth emerges, just before [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] and [[Peter Beale|Peter]] are born in December. Married life and motherhood takes its toll on Cindy and she has two affairs, first with Matt, a lifeguard, in 1994, and then with Simon's half-brother, [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]), also Ian's half-brother, in 1995. Cindy and David meet secretly for a year and she falls in love with David, growing less and less tolerant of Ian. Suspecting Cindy is cheating, Ian hires a private investigator, who films Cindy and David in a clinch. Ian vows to take Cindy to court for custody of their children. David loses interest in Cindy so she takes drastic action and in October 1996, she hires a hitman to kill Ian. Although she changes her mind, it is too late and Ian is shot, collapsing in a pool of blood in front of Cindy. The police suspect Cindy is involved and when David is called in for questioning, Cindy knows she will soon be arrested, so decides to flee with her children. Assisted by David and [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]), she collects her sons, but is unable to get Lucy, and is forced to leave without her. David also stays behind, promising Cindy that he will try to get Lucy and join her later, but he never does.

Ian's private investigator tracks Cindy to Italy in 1997. Ian, [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) find her, and Phil and Grant abduct Steven and Peter while Ian claims he still loves Cindy and will forgive her. Desperate to get her daughter back, Cindy goes along with him but grows suspicious and calls the police, but it is too late. Despite a police chase, Ian brings his sons back to Walford. Cindy soon follows Ian back to Walford with her new boyfriend, [[Nick Holland (EastEnders)|Nick Holland]] (Dominic Taylor). She takes Ian to court for custody of the children and wins. However, moments after the verdict, Cindy is arrested for attempted murder when Ian's associates persuade the hitman to tell the police about Cindy's involvement, so she loses and Ian wins full custody of the children and Cindy is charged and held on remand while she is pregnant by Nick. After realising Cindy is guilty, Nick leaves her in prison without any money for a lawyer. On 5 November 1998, Ian receives news that Cindy has died in childbirth. Her daughter survives and is named [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy]] by Ian, in her mother's honour. Custody is given to Cindy's sister, [[Gina Williams]] ([[Nicola Cowper]]).

==Creation==
Cindy was introduced in 1988 in a minor role as a love-interest for [[Simon Wicks]] ([[Nick Berry]]). She was due to appear in only eleven episodes but the character evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michelle can't hold back the years; Ex-EastEnders stars turns 40... but she is in no mood to celebrate|date=25 October 2003|work=Evening Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Colin Brake]] has suggested that Cindy was "the most important character for the future" to be introduced in 1988, despite her low-key entrance.&lt;ref name="first10years"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has commented, "Cindy arrived for 11 episodes, working on a hat stall and as a tease for Wicksy, but evolved into a much juicier character. [EastEnders creator] Julia Smith said it would change my life. I didn't believe her - how wrong I was."&lt;ref name="digitalspy.co.uk"/&gt;

The '''Erotemata''' are the first printed basic [[Greek language|Greek]] [[grammar]] in use in Western Europe, written by [[Manuel Chrysoloras]] who was a pioneer is spreading [[Greek literature]] in [[Western Europe]]. 

Chrysoloras' ''Erotemata'' were first published almost certainly in 1471 in [[Venice]] by Adam de Ambergau. It can be considered the first Greek book ever printed, since it bears a Greek title-page and the text contains large parts in Greek. It enjoyed immediate and considerable success in Italy, but also among later leading humanists, being studied by [[Thomas Linacre]] at [[Oxford]] and by [[Desiderius Erasmus]] at [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt; CHRYSOLORAS, Manuel.

[[File:Entrance to the Mall Galleries.JPG|thumb|The Mall Galleries building]]
The '''Federation of British Artists''' (FBA) consists of nine art societies, and is based at '''Mall Galleries''' in [[London]] where the societies' Annual Exhibitions are held. The societies represent living artists working in the [[United Kingdom]] who create contemporary [[figurative art]]. Mall Galleries aim to ‘promote, inspire and educate audiences about the [[visual arts]].’

==Description==

The FBA has over 500 artist-members, who regularly exhibit their work and also accept open submissions from the public. In addition to the member societies, other societies and individual artists also stage shows at Mall Galleries. Over 100 prizes and awards are administered each year by the societies.

The gallery also has a commissions department and Friends organisation. The galleries' education department runs a Schools Programme, which includes gallery based workshops for Primary and Secondary school students.

Gallery projects include a drawing school and summer courses run by the [[New English Art Club]], as well as The [[Hesketh Hubbard Art Society]], the largest life drawing society in London, who meet to draw from life models.

The FBA is a registered charity, number 200048, and was established in 1961.

In February 2011 the Mall Galleries mounted an exhibition, "Pure Gold: 50 Years of the Federation of British Artists", curated by Anthony J Lester, Hon.RMS, FRBA, FRSA. An illustrated, 100 page catalogue ({{ISBN|978-0-9560219-3-9}}) was published to accompany the show.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5658">[[Image:J-Dryden.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[John Dryden]], who formulated and wrote the heroic drama in the 1670s.]]
'''Heroic drama''' is a type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] popular during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era in [[England]], distinguished by both its verse structure and its subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Waith, ''Ideas of Greatness: Heroic Drama in England'', London, Routledge, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Douglas Canfield, ''Heroes and States: On the Ideology of Restoration Tragedy'', Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The subgenre of heroic drama evolved through several works of the middle to later 1660s; [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[The Indian Emperour]]'' ([[1665 in literature|1665]]) and [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery| Roger Boyle's]] ''[[The Black Prince (play)|The Black Prince]]'' ([[1667 in literature|1667]]) were key developments.

==Dryden in 1670==
The term "heroic drama" was invented by Dryden for his play, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' ([[1670 in literature|1670]]).  For the ''Preface'' to the printed version of the play, Dryden argued that the drama was a species of ''[[epic poetry]]'' for the stage, that, as the epic was to other poetry, so the heroic drama was to other plays.  Consequently, Dryden derived a series of rules for this type of play.

First, the play should be composed in [[heroic verse]] (closed couplets in iambic pentameter).  Second, the play must focus on a subject that pertains to national foundations, mythological events, or important and grand matters.  Third, the hero of the heroic drama must be powerful, decisive, and, like [[Achilles]], dominating even when wrong.  ''The Conquest of Granada'' followed all of these rules.  The story was that of the national foundation of [[Spain]] (and [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] was known to be fond of Spanish plays), and the hero, Almanzor, was a man of great martial prowess and temperament.

Dryden's ''Conquest of Granada'' is often considered one of the better heroic tragedies, but his highest achievement is his adaptation (which he called ''All for Love'', 1678) of Shakespeare's ''Anthony and Cleopatra'' to the heroic formula. Other heroic dramatists were Nathaniel Lee (''The Rival Queens'') and Thomas Otway, whose ''Venice Preserved'' is a fine tragedy that transcends the usual limitations of the form. We also owe indirectly to heroic tragedy two very amusing parodies of the type: the Duke of Buckingham's ''The Rehearsal'' and Henry Fielding's ''The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great''

==Other dramatists==
"Those who associate 'heroic drama' primarily with the use of the 'heroic couplet' usually set as its extent the years from 1664 to 1678. This, certainly, is its period of fullest development and authority. Those who prefer to accentuate the elements suggested by the very term 'heroic' rather than the strict rhymed verse form are willing to admit wider limits."&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, ''English Drama of the Restoration and Eighteenth Century, 1642&amp;ndash;1780'', New York, Macmillan, 1914; p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration plays by Sir [[William Davenant]], [[Thomas Otway]], [[Nathaniel Lee]], [[John Crowne]], [[Elkanah Settle]], and [[John Banks (playwright)|John Banks]], and later works by [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] and [[Joseph Addison]], have been included in tighter or looser definitions of heroic drama.&lt;ref&gt;Nettleton, pp. 24-9; Waith, pp. 235-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heroic drama in literary criticism==
Today, drama is divided up into numerous subgenres; Dryden, however, worked from [[Classical literature|Classical]] critics.  There was little dramatic critical theory for him to appeal to, and the new rules brought over from [[France]] (particularly those of [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]] and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]) did not match English theatrical history or practice.  The emphasis on unities and on maintaining only Classically proscribed dramatic forms also came from [[Thomas Rymer]], who condemned the heterogeneity of the stage.  [[Aristotle]] had only spoken of [[satire]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and [[tragedy]], and [[Horace]] also wrote only of [[comedy]], tragedy and satire, and so Dryden was seeking to square actual theatrical practice with an ancient framework for literature.  He was attempting his own neo-classicism.  The [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] had divided Shakespeare's plays into "history," "tragedy," and "comedy," but these terms were stretched.  Dryden, therefore, implicitly recognizes that drama had moved into the territory of other types of poetry, but he strives to restrain that freedom by reforming the stage to a true and epic subject matter. 

==Satirical response==
[[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]] and others satirized heroic drama in ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''.  The satire was successful enough that heroic drama largely disappeared afterward.  Buckingham attacked the stupidity of blustering, military heroes, as well as the apparent self-importance of attempting a dramatic entertainment about the serious subjects of military and national history.

Buckingham's criticism of Dryden in ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]'' is partly Dryden's bombastic verse but, more pointedly, Dryden's ''personal'' interest in creating a "pure" drama.  The character of Bayes is ludicrous more for his hubris in damning actual plays in favor of imagined ones than he is for being a poetaster.

'''Hyperdrama''' is a dramatic performance generated by playscripts written in [[hypertext]]. The performance is noted for its split narrative with scenes branching to play simultaneously in an expanded performance space. The audience is mobile, able to follow actors and watch scenes as each individual chooses.

According to [[Astrid Ensslin]] in her book ''Canonizing Hypertext''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Canonizing Hypertext|last = Ensslin|first = Astrid|publisher = Continuum|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-8264-9558-7|location = |pages = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Continuum, London, 2007), the term hyperdrama "was coined by hyperdramatist and theorist Charles Deemer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ibiblio.org/cdeemer/hdrama.htm|title = Hyperdrama|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; who understands 'traditional drama as a special case of hyperdrama' (p27)." Ensslin places Deemer's one-act hyperdrama ''The Last Song of Violeta Parra''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ibiblio.org/cdeemer/chile-m.html|title = The Last Song of Violeta Parra|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the canon of "first generation hypertext." Deemer also has written a hyperdrama expansion of Chekhov's ''The Seagull''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Seagull Hyperdrama|last = Deemer|first = Charles|publisher = Sextant Books|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Harvard’s The American Repertory Theater and [[Punchdrunk]] performed ''[[Sleep No More (2009 play)|Sleep No More]],'' "a [http://www.ibiblio.org/cdeemer/newhype.htm hyperdrama] rendition of ''Macbeth'' with a creepy, Hitchcock feel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://htlit.com/archives/October2009/SleepNoMore.html|title = Sleep No More|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Hannah Rudman, who wrote "[http://www.consultrudman.com/benefactor-play/ The Benefactor: a Hyperdrama]" in 1998 with Dr Billy Smart, describes the form this way: "A hyperdrama is a play that is written in hypertext, that is performed as a promenade and that is realised on multiple levels. Scenes happen simultaneously throughout a performance space. In this hyperdrama, there are five different locations where the action takes place. The scripts for the different locations are divided into levels which represent the time span of the piece (about 45 minutes real time). All the characters and locations in this hyperdrama are of equal importance. As a reader, you could follow the path of one character through the play by clicking on their hypertext links; read all the separate scripts in a linear fashion; or explore the hyperdrama more randomly by swapping between rooms via the hotlinks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consultrudman.com/benefactor-play/|title=The Benefactor: a Hyperdrama|last=Rudman|first=Hannah|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell Anderson, author of ''Woyzeck: a Hyperdrama,'' calls his play "a performance in &lt;span class="a"&gt;the ‘hyperdrama’ format: that is, where multiple elements of performance occur in multiple locations simultaneously."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.academia.edu/10351971/Woyzeck_a_Hyperdrama|title = Woyzeck: a Hyperdrama|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tegan Zimmerman uses the presentation software [[Prezi]] to explore "Hypertext and Hyperdrama" and their relationship online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://prezi.com/3bj3w8y4eq2d/hypertext-and-hyperdrama/|title = Hypertext and Hyperdrama|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other hyperdrama works of note are ''[[Tamara (play)|Tamara]]'' by John Krizanc, which had a long run in Los Angeles in the 1980s, and ''[[Tony and Tina's Wedding]]'', perhaps the most widely produced and popular hyperdrama.

A number of universities have added the study of Hyperdrama to their hypertext and electronic media studies: the University of Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/courses/ensp481/syllabus.html|title = Syllabus|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunxis Community College,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tunxis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Hyperdrama08-syllabus-14-22.pdf|title = Course Syllabus|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; New York University,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/TimeSpace/timespace.html|title = Writing: Time and Space|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; among them.

Discussion of hyperdrama is included in the book ''Theatre In Cyberspace'' (Peter Lang, 1999): "theatre practitioners are increasing their potential audiences with online technology while attempting to discover how to present theatre in an interactive yet non-corporeal way. Also fascinating is how educators and practitioners can collaborate, creating online performance spaces that can be adapted for teaching, and creating online teaching techniques that can be adapted for performance. This volume of essays presents information from some of the pioneers in the field of cyberspace theatre who write of their work in both theoretical and practical terms, thus creating a kind of ''Theatre and Its Double'' for computers and theatre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=44689 |title=Peter Lang Publishers |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151510/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=44689 |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ibraaz''''' is an [[online]] forum for [[visual culture]] in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. 

== Publication ==
''Ibraaz'' publishes an annual online platform that focuses on research questions conceived through a network of editorial contributors based in the Middle East and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/platforms/|title=Where to Now? Shifting Regional Dynamics and Cultural Production in North Africa and the Middle East|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its key editorial aim is to publish emerging writers and artists, alongside work by internationally renowned writers, academics, curators, activists, and filmmakers.

''Ibraaz'' works by posing annual ‘platforms’ where a question is put to writers, thinkers and artists about an issue relevant to the [[MENA]] region. This platform is sent to respondents both within and beyond the MENA region. Content is added to the website every month. Contributions are archived every twelve months when a new platform begins. 

''Ibraaz ''also publishes a series of books, edited by Anthony Downey, under the 'Visual Culture in the Middle East' title. To date, these have included ''Future Imperfect: Contemporary Art Practices and Cultural Institutions in the Middle East ''(Sternberg Press, 2016); ''Dissonant Archives: Contemporary Visual Culture and Contested Narratives in the Middle East ''([[I.B. Tauris]], 2015); and ''Uncommon Grounds: New Media and Critical Practices in North Africa and the Middle East'' (I.B. Tauris, 2014).

== History ==
''Ibraaz'' was set up from discussions between Anthony Downey, Kamel Lazaar and Lina Lazaar. It was founded as a research platform to rethink stereotypical frames of reference that have defined discussions around cultural production from within and beyond the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/essays/8|title=Beyond the Former Middle East|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural platform was launched as part of the 54th [[Venice Biennale]] in June 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/news/1|title=Ibraaz Launch Venice|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside the exhibition ''The Future of a Promise'', the largest Pan-Arab exhibition to be held at the Venice Biennale. ''Ibraaz'' Platform 001 responded to regional developments across North Africa and the Middle East, the so-called ‘[[Arab Spring]]’ and its effects upon the visual culture of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/platforms/1|title=What do we need to know about the MENA region today?|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ibraaz'' is an initiative of the [[Kamel Lazaar Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kamellazaarfoundation.org/project/ibraaz|title=Ibraaz|date=2016-09-19|work=Kamel Lazaar Foundation|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope of coverage and activities ==
''Ibraaz''’s content covers mostly contemporary visual culture from or about the Middle East and its [[diaspora]]. However, it can also include non-visual culture, such as [[Sound art|sound-based art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/projects/53|title=98weeks: Our Lines Are Now Open|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other periods, such as [[Modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/reviews/39|title=Re-Framing Modernism|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content consists of essays, interviews, reviews, artists' projects, platform responses and video contributions in its online channel.

In addition to the online platform and publications, ''Ibraaz'' organize and co-host events relating to visual culture in the Middle East. These include book launches,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://delfinafoundation.com/whats-on/book-launch-uncommon-grounds-with-ibraaz-and-ib-tauris/|title=Delfina Foundation — Book Launch: Uncommon Grounds with Ibraaz &amp; I.B.

'''''Inpress''''' was a free weekly [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-sized music magazine ([[street press]]) that was published in [[Melbourne]],&lt;ref name=sbel&gt;{{cite news|author=Sarah Bella|title=Drum Media, Inpress and Time Off to be Rebranded|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/drum-media-inpress-time-off-to-be-rebranded/|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Music Feeds|date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=appd&gt;{{cite web|title=Inpress magazine|url=http://www.appdata.com/uapps/ios/2580401-inpress-magazine|work=AppData|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released in the [[Geelong]] and [[Mornington Peninsula]] areas of [[Victoria, Australia]]. The magazine was published by [[Street Press Australia]]&lt;ref name=appd/&gt; on a weekly basis every Wednesday.

The magazine comprised three main sections: All music news, features and reviews fall under the ''Inpress'' banner, arts and film is covered by ''Interval'', and the central section is [[dance music]]/[[urban music]] and [[Nightclub|nightclubbing]] magazine ''Zebra'', which is also distributed separately from ''Inpress''. The editors of the paper were Andrew Mast (Managing Editor), Shane O'Donohue (Editor), Kris Swales (''Zebra'' Editor) and Daniel Crichton-Rouse (''Interval'' Editor). [[Myf Warhurst]] is a former editor.

''Inpress'' also frequently published 'special features', such as their yearly [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] guide. 

''Inpress'' contained many popular features, including local cartoonist and musician [[Fred Negro]]'s  weekly cult comic strip, ''Pub''. Other notable features within ''Inpress'' included ''Finish Line'' (industry news column), Sugarfoot's ''SoDa Pop'' (pop gossip/news column - a differently named version of which had previously appeared in ''Beat Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beat|url=http://www.beat.com.au/|work=Beat|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; until early 2004; [[Jeff Jenkins]]' ''Howzat!'' (indie rock and pop news), [[Clem Bastow]]'s ''Singled Out'' (singles reviews column) and [[Anthony Carew]]'s (some would say) notorious film reviews column in ''Interval'', ''Film Carew''. 

in 2006, Interests associated with ''Inpress'' publishers Craig and Leigh Treweek bought the influential [[Sydney]] street press ''[[Drum Media]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Monika Lackmann|title=Sydney’s Drum Media Bought By Melbourne’s Inpress Magazine|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/aust/3967/|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Faster Louder|date=8 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Treweek said at the time that "This is a great opportunity to build a strong music media outlet that is supportive of the local music scene at a grass roots level."

In August 2013 ''Inpress'' and other two magazines of the company, ''Drum Media'' and ''[[Time Off]]'', were merged under a new title, ''The Music''.&lt;ref name=sbel/&gt;

The '''Jewish Theater of New York''' is a theatre company founded in 1994, with the production of ''[[One Hundred Gates]]'' by playwright/director [[Tuvia Tenenbom]]. 

{{As of|2003}}, The Jewish Theater of New York is the only [[English language|English-speaking]] [[Jew]]ish theatre company in [[New York (state)|New York state]].

The Theater normally presents between one and two new shows a year in [[New York City]]. {{As of|2001}}, its productions are also mounted yearly in [[Europe]] [http://jewishtheater.org/Jewish%20Theater/International%20Partners.htm (link)]. Starting 2013, the Jewish Theater combines action and word in a program it calls, Redefining Theater Through Literature, uniting [http://jewishtheater.org/Jewish%20Theater/Presentations-Abroad-2013.htm stage and literature], acting and books, into one unit.

The Theater, [[avant-garde]] and [[Experimental theatre|experimental]] at times, has been highly acclaimed by local and international critics. Some of its shows, such as ''Father of the Angels,'' ''Love Letters to Adolf Hitler,'' ''Diary of Adolf Eichmann,'' ''The Suicide Bomber,'' ''Love in Great Neck,'' ''The Last Virgin,'' ''Last Jew in Europe'' and others, have been written about in much of the Western press [http://jewishtheater.org/Jewish%20Theater/reviews.htm (link)] and are also studied in universities.  

The Jewish Theater of New York was founded by [[Tuvia Tenenbom]], a former [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[rabbi]].

The '''Kaper Koraon Treasure''' is a [[Byzantine silver]] treasure consisting of 56 individual [[silver]] items originating from [[Syria]] in the sixth and seventh centuries.

==History==
The treasure was re-discovered between 1908 and 1910. It was originally believed to have belonged to the church in [[Antioch]], a thriving Roman city on the Mediterranean  It can now be argued that the items come from a larger collection of silver from the church of Saint Sergios in modern-day [[Kurin]], [[Syria]] or that the pieces belonged to a small local church.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=Helen|title=The Arts of Byzantium|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=2001|volume=58|issue=4|pages=1–68|jstor=3269176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final items of the collection were likely interred at the site in the seventh century as the [[Byzantine Empire]] subsequently lost this area of Syria to the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] army.  The later conquering by the Muslim Arab army permanently removed the area from Byzantine control.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"/&gt;

It is believed that the Persian and Muslim Arab take-overs were relatively peaceful as historic sites around the area show little to no damage that could be attributed to that time. Though religion began to shift following the change of power and [[Christian]] artifacts were increasingly stored away from public viewing, the area did continue to benefit from relative wealth and prosperity, creating many [[secular]] works. The real halt to production of silver treasures is thought to have followed a plague throughout the area from 542 to 544.  This had a lasting impact on the economic status of the region.&lt;ref name="Dumbarton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foss|first1=Clive|title=Syria in Transition, A. D. 550-750: An Archaeological Approach|journal=Dumbarton Oak Papers|date=1997|volume=51|pages=189–269|jstor=1291765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that this accumulation of local wealth in silver objects was common throughout the area leading up to the Persian control and the sixth century plague.  Similar treasures have been found at [[Stuma]], [[Ariha|Riha]], [[Hama]], and Antioch to name a few.&lt;ref name="Dumbarton"/&gt;

The objects found in the Kaper Koraon treasure were not originally prestigious [[shrine]] gifts but were likely relatively cheap [[imitations]] made specifically for a village [[Church (building)|church]]. This can be clearly seen from recent investigations into the pieces which have shown high quantities of [[copper]] and other metals melted in with the silver to increase malleability and decrease production costs.  It is estimated that these items were the collective donations from five local families over a period of at least three decades.  Many of the stamps present on the pieces are believed to have been added after production and some note the specific [[donor]]s of each piece.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mango|first1=Marlia Mundell|title=Silver from Early Byzantium: the Kaper Koraon and Related Treasures|date=1986|publisher=Walters Art Gallery|location=Baltimore, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable pieces==
The Kaper Koraon treasure consists of 56 total silver objects including: eight [[chalice]]s, seven [[paten]]s, five crosses, one [[cross]] [[revetment]], two lamp stands, three lamps, three ewers, one flask, one bowl, one mirror, one box, eleven spoons, one ladle, two strainers, two fans, and four plaques. The other three objects are only partial pieces of broken fragments likely from other [[wikt:plaque|plaque]]s. Many of the items are religious in nature including images of the cross and Jesus's disciples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Byzyntine Legacy: Kaper Koraon Treasure|url=http://www.thebyzantinelegacy.com/walter-kaperkoraon|publisher=Walters Art Museum|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are believed to be secular but were stored with the church collection either for safe-keeping on behalf of the owner or stores of wealth for the [[parish]].&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;

Most of the silver pieces shown here still show evidence of hammering either visibly or through careful machine investigation.  Due to the limited skill level of local workers and the overworking of [[malleable]] metal, many items featured here have stress fractures or chips that were original to the piece.  Any repairs visible, such as the re-welding of a handle onto an [[ewar]], are likely original and occurred before the [[internment]] of the treasure.  Many of the chalices were hammered, welded together, and then lathed to smooth out the seams between the cup and the stem.  Some chalices shows signs of wear at these seams and around the top rim due to the method of their construction.&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;

Since their discovery, the items of the Kaper Koraon treasure have dispersed into public and private collections throughout the world including [[The Walters Art Museum]].

'''Laura Eugenia Bayley''' (4 February 1862&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;25 October 1938) was a British actress and filmmaker, active in the [[Brighton School (filmmaking)|Brighton School]] of early cinema pioneers. Born in [[Ramsgate]], Bayley performed onstage in [[Victorian burlesque]]s, [[revue]]s, and [[pantomime]]s, often with her three sisters. After marrying the showman [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]], she entered the world of early experiments with motion picture film; she played main roles in many of the most important films Smith made between 1897 and 1903, including ''[[The Kiss in the Tunnel]]'' (1899) and ''[[Mary Jane's Mishap]]'' (1903).

Behind the camera, Bayley likely played a significant hand in the creative development of Smith's fiction films, and may have directed some of those currently credited to him. She also directed and supervised numerous other films on her own, including a series for an early show-at-home projector design. Film historians have highlighted her prolific career as a film performer as well as the creative talent she brought to filmmaking.

==Early life and stage career==
[[File:Brighton aquarium photochrom.jpg|thumb|left|The Brighton Aquarium, where Bayley and her sisters performed in [[Victorian burlesque]]s]]
Bayley was born on 4 February 1862 in the English seaside town of [[Ramsgate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Cinema-by-Sea: Film and Cinema in Brighton &amp; Hove since 1896|first=David|last=Fisher|location=Brighton|publisher=Terra Media|year=2012|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her sisters Blanche, Florence, and Eva worked together as performers for J. D. Hunter's Theatre Company, which produced a "[[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]]" extravaganza every year at the Brighton Aquarium.&lt;ref name=FG/&gt; ''The Brighton Society'', in 1887, praised "the Misses Bayley … who, by their charming vocal selections added so considerably to the success of the burlesque ''Brown and the Brahmins''".&lt;ref name=FG/&gt;

Bayley's three sisters also performed without her for some Aquarium productions, such as in the [[pantomime]]s ''[[Cinderella]]'' and ''[[Dick Whittington]]'' in August 1890 and again in the latter in 1892, but the four sisters were reunited at the Aquarium for ''[[Babes in the Wood]]'' in 1894, about which the ''[[Brighton Herald]]'' commented that "The Robin Hood of Miss Laura Bayley is a distinctly comely and cheery Robin Hood".&lt;ref name=FG/&gt;

On 13 June 1888, at the Congregational Church in Ramsgate, Bayley married [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]]. Smith, known as "Bertie" among his professional colleagues,&lt;ref name=EraWedding&gt;{{citation|title=Provincial Theatricals|newspaper=[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]|date=16 June 1888|number=2595|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a young stage entertainer, performing [[Stage hypnosis|hypnosis act]]s and [[second sight]] routines in local venues, including the Brighton Aquarium.&lt;ref name=FG/&gt; Bayley and Smith married in a double wedding: the other couple was Bayley's sister Florence and the Bayleys' theatrical colleague J. D. Hunter.&lt;ref name=EraWedding/&gt;

Bayley and Smith had two children, Harold Norman and Dorothy Eugenie, in 1889 and 1890, respectively.&lt;ref name=WFPP/&gt; In 1892, Smith acquired a lease on St. Ann's Well and Wild Garden, a [[pleasure garden]] in Brighton; it reopened under his management the following spring. Together, Bayley and Smith mounted summer [[Fancy dress party|fancy dress parties]], attended by as many as 2,000 costumed patrons, at the garden. Smith also gave [[magic lantern]] performances and [[Diorama|dioramic lectures]], and exhibited the newly invented [[Phonograph|Edison phonograph]], as part of the garden's entertainments.&lt;ref name=FG/&gt;

==Film career==
[[File:Mary Jane's Mishap portrait.jpg|thumb|Bayley in costume for ''[[Mary Jane's Mishap]]'' (1903)]]
Smith's interest in novel forms of entertainment led him toward early experiments with motion picture film, and in 1897 he began making short films on the St. Ann's Well grounds.&lt;ref name=FG/&gt; By the time of Smith's foray into filmmaking, Bayley had had wide experience in comic acting for [[pantomime]] and [[revue]]s, and Smith drew extensively on her knowledge of visual humour and audience tastes.&lt;ref name=BFIsmith/&gt; She played lead roles in many of his most significant films, including ''[[Hanging out the Clothes]]'' (1897), ''[[Santa Claus (1898 film)|Santa Claus]]'' (1898), ''[[Cinderella (1898 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1898), ''[[The Kiss in the Tunnel]]'' (1899), ''[[As Seen Through the Telescope]]'' (1900), ''[[Let Me Dream Again]]'' (1900), ''[[Dorothy's Dream]]'' (1900), and ''[[Mary Jane's Mishap]]'' (1903).&lt;ref name=FG/&gt; In at least one instance, Smith and Bayley mixed their theatrical and film work together: when J. D. Hunter's company toured ''Dick Whittington'' in early 1897, Bayley and her sister Blanche performed live onstage, while Smith came along on the tour to exhibit his "animated photographs" as part of the entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Suburbia, seaside and sensation: showing films in London and the south-east, 1896–1897|pages=45–46|first=Amy Louise|last=Bethel|type=PhD thesis|publisher=University of York|year=2015|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/17808/1/Amy%20Bethel%20Thesis_Suburbia%2C%20Seaside%20and%20Sensation.pdf|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other members of Bayley's family also became involved in Smith's filmmaking; all three of her sisters probably appeared in his films,&lt;ref name=DR/&gt; as did her two children;&lt;ref name=WFPP/&gt; notably, the film historian Frank Gray suggested that Harold and Dorothy Smith probably both appear in ''Santa Claus'' and ''[[The House That Jack Built (1900 film)|The House that Jack Built]]'', and that Harold also plays the grandson in ''[[Grandma's Reading Glass]]''.&lt;ref name=FG/&gt;

During her acting career, Bayley also worked on her own as a filmmaker, making numerous short films that were designed and marketed for a home projector, the [[Biokam]].&lt;ref name=WFPP/&gt; Smith and Bayley probably worked in creative collaboration to devise the fiction films Smith directed;&lt;ref name=LM/&gt; Bayley may also have directed some of the films currently credited to Smith, as his records indicate that she supervised the "facials" (comic short films emphasising facial expression).&lt;ref name=DR/&gt; Bayley handled sales of the Biokam films and related materials,&lt;ref name=WFPP/&gt;&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; and may also have participated in the process of making cameras.&lt;ref name=DR/&gt;

Later in the decade, after the series of Biokam films, Bayley also appeared in some of Smith's 1906–1908 tests of the colour-film process [[Kinemacolor]].&lt;ref name=WFPP/&gt; Bayley died at home at 7 Melville Road, Hove, on 25 October 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Laura E Smith|work=Death Records|publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Register Office|year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Bayley's work was usually overlooked in twentieth-century assessments of the [[Brighton School (filmmaking)|Brighton School]], with some film historians simply calling her "Smith's wife" or "Mrs. Smith". Several twenty-first-century film historians have drawn attention to this neglect and to her contributions, though she remains relatively little-known in the field.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;
The [[British Film Institute]]'s [[Screenonline]] database ranks Bayley as "the most prolific British actress" in turn-of-the-century cinema.&lt;ref name=MD/&gt; In program notes for the [[Pordenone Silent Film Festival]], where three Bayley films were shown in 2002, the film historian David Robinson cited Bayley and her sisters as the first known comediennes in British film.&lt;ref name=DR/&gt; The film writer Ellen Cheshire, in a 2016 study of women working behind the camera in early film, identified Bayley as film history's first woman cinematographer.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

In a discussion of Bayley's collaboration with Smith, the film historian Frank Gray wrote: "Laura Bayley brought to this creative work a keen understanding of popular texts, an unself-conscious and dynamic style of acting and a rich sense of humour. Audiences which still laugh at her winking at the camera when watching ''Mary Jane's Mishap'' are acknowledging her considerable achievement."&lt;ref name=FG/&gt;

'''Leo Castelli''' (born '''Leo Krausz'''; September 4, 1907&amp;nbsp;– August 21, 1999) was an Italian-American [[art dealer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E2D61038F930A1575BC0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink Russel, John. "Leo Castelli, Influential Art Dealer, Dies at 91."

"Leo Castelli." Salon.com, September 11, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the movements which Castelli showed were [[Surrealism]], [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Pop Art]], [[Op Art]], [[Color field painting]], [[Hard-edge painting]],   [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Minimal Art]], [[Conceptual Art]], and [[Neo-expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1UEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA70 |first=David|last=Bourdon|publisher=Life Magazine|date=May 1970|title=Whats Up in Art, The Castelli Clan|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Leo Castelli was born Leo Krausz,&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;Dwight Garner (May 18, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/books/19book.html A Smooth Operator, at the Vanguard of the Gallery World in the 1960s] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Trieste]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the second of three children of Italian and Austro-Hungarian Jewish origin.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"&gt;[[Peter Schjeldahl]] (June 7, 2010), [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/06/07/100607crbo_books_schjeldahl Leo the Lion - How the Castelli gallery changed the art world] ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Ernest Krauss, a Hungarian by birth, who had gone to Trieste as a young man and married wealthy heiress Bianca Castelli,&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;Myrna Oliver (August 24, 1999), [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/24/news/mn-3077 Leo Castelli; Influential Dealer Promoted Careers of Artists From Johns to Warhol] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from a family of coffee importers&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Gerald Clarke (February 26, 1979), [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20073021,00.html Dealer Leo Castelli Sold the World on Pop Art, and Now He's Cleaning Up] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which had long been based there.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;John Russell (August 23, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/23/arts/leo-castelli-influential-art-dealer-dies-at-91.html Leo Castelli, Influential Art Dealer, Dies at 91] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I, which the family spent in Vienna (where Leo Castelli learned perfect German), they returned to Trieste.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; The family changed its name to "Krausz-Castelli" and then "Castelli" in the mid-1930s, when Mussolini's government required names to be Italianized.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;

After earning a law degree at the [[University of Milan]] in 1924, Castelli returned to Trieste, where his father had secured a job for him with an insurance company.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; In 1932, he went to work for an insurance company in Bucharest, where he married [[Ileana Sonnabend|Ileana Schapira]] one year later. After their marriage, the couple honeymooned in Vienna and bought their first artwork, a [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]] watercolor.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

Castelli's father-in-law, Mihai Schapira, helped him to be transferred in 1935 to the [[Banca d'Italia]] in Paris. There, Ileana's taste and money helped him start his first gallery at [[Place Vendôme]] in Paris, which was named for its co-director, the decorator René Drouin,&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; and situated between the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Ritz Hotel]] and the couturier [[Elsa Schiaparelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo Castelli's FIRST STEPS in the art world: a "Surrealist" event in Paris in '39 – by Michèle C. Cone. [[Artnet]], July 21, 2010. http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/cone/leo-castelli-surrealist-design7-21-10.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Specializing in surrealistic art,&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; the gallery opened in July 1939, with a show of modern and antique furniture, including commissioned pieces by Drouin, [[Max Ernst]], [[Meret Oppenheim]], [[Leonor Fini]] (a former girlfriend of Castelli's from Trieste), [[Eugene Berman]], and other artists in the force field of Surrealism.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;

Ileana's connections enabled the couple to flee to America at the start of World War II. Castelli's parents did not escape but died in Budapest, hounded by members of Hungary's fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Solomon (June 11, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/books/review/Solomon-t.html Leo Castelli’s New York Story] ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple would remain married for more than 25 years, and were friends and partners even after their divorce, when Ileana married Michael Sonnabend and that couple opened its own gallery.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt; Castelli arrived in the United States in 1941, by way of Marrakesh, Tangier, Algeciras, Vigo and Havana.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; He took graduate history courses in economic history&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;  at [[Columbia University]]&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; until volunteering for the Army, serving in the intelligence service in Europe. After the liberation of France, he was sent to Bucharest as an interpreter for the Allied commission that controlled the city. As a result of Castelli's military service, he was given American citizenship.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; Returning to New York, Castelli took a managerial position with his father-in-law's clothing factory.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;

==Leo Castelli Gallery==
In New York, the Castellis were two of only three non-artist members (the other was dealer [[Charles Egan Gallery|Charles Egan]])&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; of the Club, an influential coterie founded in 1949 that included [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Franz Kline]], and [[Ad Reinhardt]]. Castelli's first exercise as a private dealer came through Drouin, in 1947: some hundred canvases by [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], consigned by his widow, Nina.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; His first American curatorial effort was the [[Ninth Street Show]] of 1951, a seminal event in the emergence of Abstract Expressionism. He soon attached himself to the pioneering gallerist [[Sidney Janis]], one of the early proponents of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lamster (May 23, 2010), [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/23/entertainment/la-ca-leo-castelli-20100523 Book Review: A dealer and his galaxy of art stars in 'Leo and His Circle"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, he opened the Leo Castelli Gallery in a townhouse at 4 E. 77th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues in New York City. From the mid-1960s through the 1970s, the gallery was perhaps the most prominent commercial venue for art in the world.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;Daniel Grant (February 24, 2011), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703960804576120434103905642 Leo Castelli's Cache Of Art-History Gold] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the gallery showcased European [[Surrealism]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and other European artists. However the gallery also exhibited American [[Abstract Expressionism]]. [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Norman Bluhm]] were some artists who were included in group shows.

In 1958, [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] joined the gallery, signaling a turning away from [[Abstract Expressionism]], towards [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]] and [[Conceptual Art]].[[File:Warhol Flowers, offset lithograph.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Castelli Gallery's first [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]] exhibition, ''Flowers'', November, 1964]] From the early 1960s through the late 70s, [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Lee Bontecou]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Ed Ruscha]], [[Salvatore Scarpitta]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Lawrence Weiner]] and [[Joseph Kosuth]] joined the stable of Castelli artists. He gave Johns, Stella and Lichtenstein their first one-man shows.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; Castelli opened a temporary annex, the Castelli Warehouse, on West 108th Street, with a show organized by [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], of environmental sculpture by nine artists, including Nauman, Serra, and [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; In 1971 Leo Castelli opened a downtown [[SoHo]] branch of the Leo Castelli Gallery at 420 West Broadway, in a building bought by the Hague Art Delivery Company and a cooperative of dealers: Castelli took the second floor; his former wife's [[Sonnabend Gallery]] the took the third floor, and [[André Emmerich]] (later replaced by [[Charles Cowles (art dealer)|Charles Cowles]]) took the top floor; while John Weber, (former director of the [[Virginia Dwan (art dealer)|Dwan Gallery]]) rented his gallery on the fourth floor. In the 1980s, Castelli opened a second larger downtown exhibition space at a 142 Greene Street also in [[SoHo]]. He later mounted joint shows with [[Mary Boone]], of [[Julian Schnabel]], in 1981, and [[David Salle]], in 1982.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;

Castelli also pioneered a stipend system that was unknown in New York when he opened his gallery. He put his artists on a payroll whether or not their work sold. For this and other reasons, desertions were initially rare among his artists. When Castelli discovered Serra in 1967, for example, he offered him a guarantee of three years of monthly payments even though he did not expect to sell any of the unknown sculptor's lead-plate work in that time.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; Castelli also was known for spotting new talent and insisting on European exposure for his American artists, leading to Rauschenberg in 1964 becoming the first American to win the [[Venice Biennale]]'s international grand prize in painting.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; His most important clients included [[Museum Ludwig|Peter Ludwig]] and [[Giuseppe Panza]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;

Castelli's second wife, Antoinette Fraissex du Bost,&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; opened Castelli Graphics, an art gallery devoted to the prints and photographs of Castelli Gallery and other artists.&lt;ref name="NYT87"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/obituaries/antoinette-castelli-58-dies-president-of-graphics-gallery.html Antoinette Castelli, 58, Dies; President of Graphics Gallery] ''New York Times'', September 4, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple also had a son together, Jean-Christophe Castelli, but Antoinette Castelli died in 1987.&lt;ref name="NYT87"/&gt; In 1995 Leo Castelli married the Italian art historian Barbara Bertozzi Castelli.

In 2015, Bertozzi Castelli opened a one-room satellite gallery at 1046 Madison Avenue, near 80th Street, with [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]]'s installation ''Lead and Felt'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Hilarie M. Sheets (September 24, 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/arts/design/richard-prince-takes-a-new-approach-to-cowboys.html Changing Galleries] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Castelli received the rosette of the [[French Legion of Honor]], allegedly in exchange for donating works by Johns to the [[Centre Pompidou]].&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; The mayor of Trieste made him the honorary director of the [[Revoltella Museum]]. In 1998, the [[National Arts Club]] awarded Castelli its Centennial Medal of Honor. On this occasion, [[Dennis Hopper]] called Castelli "the godfather of the contemporary art world."&lt;ref&gt;[[Phoebe Hoban]] (March 29, 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/29/style/the-night-a-pearl-beyond-price.html A Pearl Beyond Price] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 a traveling exhibit honoring the 25th anniversary of Castelli Gallery visited the [[San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art|La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art]]. The [[Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale|Museum of Art]], Fort Lauderdale, showed "Three Decades of Exploration: Homage to Leo Castelli", an exhibit of more than 30 works by artists discovered, shown and encouraged by Castelli in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Rober Hurlburt (November 1, 1987), [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-11-01/features/8702030168_1_leo-castelli-american-art-contemporary-art Exhibition A Tribute To Noted Art Dealer] ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the [[Butler Institute of American Art]] presented "Leo Castelli: a tribute exhibition". In 1996, [[Gagosian Gallery]] mounted the exhibition "Leo Castelli: An Exhibition in Honor of His Gallery and Artists" in Beverly Hills.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Many artists have enshrined Castelli in their works. [[Elaine de Kooning]] and [[Richard Artschwager]] painted his portrait, Warhol made a silkscreen of him in a jacket and tie.

In 1988, when there were no tax deductions for gifts to museums, Castelli gave one of the icons of postwar American art, Robert Rauschenberg's ''Bed'' (1955) to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. In 1992, amid rumors that Castelli was negotiating to sell his archives to the [[Getty Center]] in Los Angeles, his collection was said to be worth some $2 million.&lt;ref name="CAG"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/arts/design/19voge.html|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=Castelli Archives Going to Smithsonian|publisher=New York Times|date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, Castelli's heirs – his widow, Barbara Bertozzi Castelli, and his two children, Jean-Christopher Castelli and Nina Castelli Sundell – announced the donation of the gallery's archives from 1957 through 1999 to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Archives of American Art]].

The origins of [[Christianity]] on the island may be traced to the visit of [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]], [[Barnabas|St. Barnabas]] and [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] around AD 46.&lt;ref name="Medieval"/&gt; After the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]] of the western Roman Empire, Cyprus came under the sway of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], although the timely discovery of Barnabas' [[relics]] helped the [[Church of Cyprus]] uphold its [[autocephaly]].&lt;ref name="Stylianou"/&gt; The crusader [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] outlived the [[Fall of Constantinople]] by a generation; the subsequent [[Catherine Cornaro|sale]] of the island to [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] led to a brief period of Italo-Byzantine painting.&lt;ref name="Stylianou"/&gt; In 1571 Cyprus [[Ottoman Cyprus|fell to the Ottomans]] and the practice of ecclesiastic wall painting largely came to an end.&lt;ref name="Stylianou"/&gt;

==Organization of space==
Subject to the [[Eastern Orthodox church architecture|layout]] of each church, the [[Iconography#Christian iconography|iconographic]] schema typically accords with the classic Byzantine [[Wiktionary:tripartition|tripartition]], evident also in [[Byzantine mosaic|Byzantine mosaic decoration]], the three zones comprising: (1) the [[dome]] and [[Semi-dome|conch]] of the [[apse]]; (2) the [[pendentive]]s, [[squinches]] and upper [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]]; and (3) the lower, secondary vaults and walls. The first is reserved for depictions of the holiest persons, the [[Christ Pantocrator|Christ Pantokrator]] and the [[Madonna (art)|Virgin]]; the second for scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] and the [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|festival cycle]]; and the third for the choir of [[Intercession of saints|intercessory]] [[Saint#Eastern Orthodoxy|saints]].&lt;ref name="Medieval"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Byzantine Mosaic Decoration: Aspects of Monumental Art in Byzantium |author=[[Otto Demus|Demus, Otto]] |publisher=[[Kegan Paul]] |year=1947 |pages=14–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Since the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, a number of churches in the [[Northern Cyprus|north]] have been [[Looted art|looted]] and their wall paintings [[Detachment of wall paintings|detached]] to supply the international [[antiquities trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War and cultural heritage: Cyprus after the 1974 Turkish invasion |author=Jansen, Michael E. |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/DA/DA.nsf/All/5C63072411078AB9C22572750055D67D |title=Looting of Cultural Heritage |publisher=Department of Antiquities |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them is the [[Church of Saint Evphemianos, Lysi|Church of St. Evphemianos]] in [[Lysi]]: the thirteenth-century [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantrokrator]] and surrounding angels were detached, leaving their feet behind; the paintings were then acquired for the [[Menil Collection]] and displayed at the [[Byzantine Fresco Chapel]] in [[Houston, Texas]] before their [[Art repatriation|repatriation]] to the south in 2012.&lt;ref name="loot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lysi"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Byzantine Masterpiece Recovered: The Thirteenth-Century Murals of Lysi, Cyprus |author=Weyl Carr, Annemarie |publisher=[[Menil Collection]] |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-292-78118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="repatriation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/da/da.nsf/DMLnews_en/DMLnews_en?OpenDocument |title=The Repatriation of the Wall Paintings of the Church of Agios Euphemianos, Lysi |publisher=Department of Antiquities |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, many churches in the south been the subject of [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] interventions, conducted by the Department of Antiquities, [[Dumbarton Oaks#Institutional Program|Dumbarton Oaks]] and the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], aimed at reconciling the competing demands of stability, legibility and authenticity within the framework of ongoing devotional practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iiconservation.org/es/node/1484 |title=The Byzantine and Post-Byzantine Wall Paintings of Cyprus: Conservation Practice in a Context of Continuing Religious Use, in: Conservation and the Eastern Mediterranean: Contributions to the 2010 IIC Congress |author1=Solomidou-Ieronymidou, Marina |author2=Rickerby, Stephen |publisher=[[International Institute for Conservation]] |year=2010 |pages=231–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of notable '''[[game designer|video game designers]]''', past and present, in alphabetical order.  The people in this list already have Wikipedia entries, and as such did significant design for notable computer [[computer game]]s, [[console game]]s, or [[arcade game]]s. It does not include people in managerial roles (which often includes titles like "Producer" or "Development Director") or people who developed a concept without doing actual design work on the game itself (sometimes applicable to "co-creator" or "creator" roles). Just because a game is listed next to a designer's name does not imply that person was the sole designer. As with films, the credits for video games can be complicated.

'''Lucrecia Martel''' (born December 14, 1966) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] film director, screenwriter and producer whose feature films have frequented [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto]], and many other international film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb name|0551506}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Film scholar Paul Julian Smith wrote in 2015 that she is “arguably the most critically acclaimed [[auteur]] in Spanish-language [[art cinema]] outside Latin America” and that her “[[transnational cinema|transnational]] auteurism and demanding features have earned her a hard-won reputation in the [[world cinema|world art cinema]] [[film festival#Notable festivals|festival circuit]].”&lt;ref name="PJS"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smith, Paul Julian |editor1-last=Parvati |editor1-first=Nair |editor2-last=Gutiérrez-Albilla |editor2-first=Julián Daniel |title=Hispanic and Lusophone Women Filmmakers: Theory, Practice and Difference |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |location=U.K. |pages=12–24 |isbn=9780719083570 |format=Print |chapter=Transnational Co-productions and Female Filmmakers: The Cases of Lucrecia Martel and Isabel Coixet|date=2013-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Her 2001 debut feature film ''[[La Ciénaga (film)|La Ciénaga]]'' ("The Swamp"), about an indulgent [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] extended family spending the summertime in a decrepit vacation home in provincial [[Salta|Salta, Argentina]], was internationally highly acclaimed upon release and introduced a new and vital voice to Argentine cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Ciénaga|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/28113-la-cienaga|website=[[The Criterion Collection]]|accessdate=30 October 2017|quote=The release of Lucrecia Martel’s ''La Ciénaga'' heralded the arrival of an astonishingly vital and original voice in Argentine cinema.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Poblete |first1=Joel |title=El cine argentino está muy vital |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827031505/http://www.mabuse.cl/1448/article-74875.html |website=Mabuse Film Magazine |archiveurl=http://www.mabuse.cl/1448/article-74875.html |archivedate=27 August 2007 |location=Chile |format=Web |date=11 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|authorlink1=Roger Ebert|title=La Cienaga Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2001)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/la-cienaga-2001|website=[[RogerEbert.com]]|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=30 October 2017|date=19 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGavin|first1=Patrick Z.|title=Family tensions fill risky 'La Cienaga'|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-10-19/entertainment/0110190347_1_la-cienaga-family-argentinean|website=Tribune Digital|publisher=[[Tronc]]|accessdate=30 October 2017|date=19 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Cienaga (2001)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_cienaga/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Oubiña called it "one of the highest achievements" of the [[Cinema of Argentina#Contemporary cinema|New Argentine Cinema]], a wave of contemporary filmmaking that began in the mid-1990s in reaction to decades of [[December 2001 riots in Argentina|political]] and [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|economic crises]] in the country. The film, Oubiña wrote, is "a rare expression of an extremely troubled moment in the nation’s recent history. It is a masterpiece of singular maturity".&lt;ref name="DO" /&gt;

==Early life==
The second of seven children, Martel was born and raised in [[Salta|Salta, Argentina]]. Her father Ferdi owned and operated a paint shop, while her mother Bochi dedicated herself to the family. Her parents met in university (where Ferdi studied science and Bochi studied philosophy) and got married at 24 years old. Eventually they left their careers and settled in Salta. 

In [[education in Argentina#Primary education|primary school]], Martel’s [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] uncle helped her develop interests in [[mythology]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Latin]]. In fifth grade, she set her sights on gaining admission to the elite, "ultra-Catholic" [[education in Argentina#Secondary education|secondary school]] Bachillerato Humanista Moderno, because it was the only school in Salta that offered classes in dead languages. Her parents opposed the school because of its elitist tradition which they felt reinforced class differences, but, because of the [[:es:Categoría:Alumnado del Bachillerato Humanista Moderno de Salta|school's prominent alumni]] and Martel’s intellectual curiosity, they did not stop her from her pursuit. Eventually, Martel passed the demanding entrance exam and enrolled in the school in the sixth grade. Since she came from a “solidly middle class” family, as she stated in a revealing 2008 interview with ''[[Bomb (magazine)|BOMB Magazine]]'', Martel felt like an outsider at the school. Her peers, she said, attended the school because their families expected them to, while she only attended it so she could study Greek and Latin. In a 2018 interview with ''[[Gatopardo (magazine)|Gatopardo]]'' magazine, her mother said that at the school Martel was a “radical and challenging” honor roll student who excelled in science.

In her home, Martel says "there was a very deep devotion to [[storytelling]]." Her father, mother, and maternal grandmother Nicolasa were "very good storytellers" and would tell her and her six siblings "lots of stories" to keep them quiet in bed while the adults took their afternoon [[siesta]]. She was especially fascinated by the way her grandmother used different sounds, tones, and carefully selected pauses to establish "atmosphere" in her scary, fantastical stories. "As a child," Martel says, "and even today, I have always been captivated by the form not only of stories and storytelling, but also of conversation and the way people pause and leave space for someone to intervene. All the ways that, especially when you’re a child, you’re charmed and steered just by words alone." She says that her fascination with this "world of conversation" in oral storytelling is what fueled her passion for cinematic storytelling and the emphasis on [[Cinematic techniques#Sound|sound]] in her films.

Martel first used a video camera when she was "15 or 16" years old, she says, after her father bought one to store memories of their large family. "A very big investment for us," she says of the camera, nobody in the family used it but her. "I began recording conversations and everyday things: family stuff," she says. "My family got used to it because I was always filming…. There are two or three years in our family life where I don’t appear at all in videos or photos, because I was always behind the camera. It was the discovery of something that fascinated me, but it didn’t seem to me then that my future could be related to that."&lt;ref name="LM"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Monteagudo, Luciano|editor1-last=Bernades|editor1-first=Horacio|editor2-last=Lerer|editor2-first=Diego|editor3-last=Wolf|editor3-first=Sergio|title=New Argentine Cinema: Themes, Auteurs and Trends of Innovation|date=2002|publisher=Ediciones Tatanka|location=Buenos Aires|isbn=9789879972830|pages=69–78|format=Print|chapter=Lucrecia Martel: Whispers at ''Siesta'' Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she was 17 years old, she accompanied her father to [[Buenos Aires]] and attended a cinema projection of ''[[Camila (film)|Camila]]'' (1984), a film written and directed by [[María Luisa Bemberg]] and produced by [[Lita Stantic]] about a real and tragic love story between a priest and a young lady of Buenos Aires high society. Impressed with the film’s women creators and mainstream success, Martel says that as a result of the viewing she “thought the cinema was a woman's job,” a “confusion,” as she describes it, that "stayed with [her]” for years.&lt;ref name="HG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MY"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yemayel |first1=Mónica |title=Lucrecia Martel: El ojo extraterrestre |url=https://gatopardo.com/reportajes/entrevista-lucrecia-martel/ |website=[[Gatopardo (magazine)|Gatopardo]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |format=Web |date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Upon graduating from [[education in Argentina#Secondary education|secondary school]], Martel intended to study physics at the [[Balseiro Institute]], but she "started to have doubts" and instead enrolled in an art history course at the [[National University of Salta]], as well as in chemical engineering and zoology courses in [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]], a nearby province. "Suffer[ing] uncertainty” and trying to decide “what to study or do with [her] life,”&lt;ref name="LM" /&gt; she [[pig farming|farmed pigs]] that year, too—breeding, raising, and selling them—and even considered making it her future livelihood.&lt;ref name="NMF" /&gt; However, poor sales of just two pigs per month proved it would not be a feasible career option for her.

At the end of that school year, Martel traveled to Buenos Aires to study [[advertising]] at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina|Catholic University]]. The program combined creativity and technique, so she and her family thought it could work for her. Although Martel says she lost her [[Catholicism|Catholic faith]] at 15 years old, at the university she volunteered with [[Catholic Action]] and spoke against [[abortion]]. Feeling uncomfortable, she decided to distance herself from the faith and leave the school to pursue the new [[communication sciences]] degree program at the [[University of Buenos Aires]]. She describes the program as “a typical post-transition-to-democracy program made to train journalists and media analysts. Of course, it was an area of Argentine culture that had been hit especially hard by the years of dictatorship. There were very interesting professors who were returning from exile at the time, people with more left-leaning ways of thinking. It was a good moment for the program because no one quite knew exactly what this career entailed.” She completed all of the degree requirements, she says, but “didn’t do any of the paperwork toward receiving the [actual] degree." However, she believes that her time at the school "helped [her] out a lot."

Not wanting to neglect her interests in the technical and the creative, while at the University of Buenos Aires she enrolled in a nighttime [[animation]] course at the [[:es:Instituto de arte cinematográfico de Avellaneda|Film Art Institute of Avellaneda (IDAC)]] located about 5.5 miles away, which Martel describes was a significant commute at the time. “Something of the scientific spirit in me remained,” she says regarding her decision to enroll in the school, “and I liked how animation was very technical, precise, and controlled.” At the school, she started to meet people who were studying film and began to produce short films.

While at IDAC, she decided to take the admission exam for Argentina’s only state-sponsored film school at the time—the [[:es:Escuela Nacional de Experimentación y Realización Cinematográfica|National School of Film Experimentation and Production (ENERC)]]. Since over 1,000 people signed up for the exam and only 30 vacancies existed at the school, applicants were required to take a “huge qualifying course,” which Martel says she spent months preparing for. After she “finally got in,” the school closed due to lack of funds.&lt;ref name="ND"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dawson |first1=Nick |title=Lucrecia Martel, ''The Headless Woman'' |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/1382-lucrecia-martel-the-headless-woman/ |website=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker Magazine]] |publisher=Independent Filmmaker Project (IFP) |accessdate=29 June 2018 |format=Web |date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; “When school was supposed to start,” she says, “the economic crisis was already so severe that there weren’t any professors or materials. We didn’t have classes. The only real possibility was to study [[autodidacticism|autodidactically]], to watch films and analyze them. I watched ''[[Pink Floyd – The Wall|Pink Floyd: The Wall]]'' 23 times, analyzing the montage. We would watch a film many times to learn how it was edited. I was learning in many different ways—participating in short films that friends were making, helping with production or photography, anything just to keep learning.”&lt;ref name="HG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MY" /&gt; Martel has maintained in interviews that she was self-taught.&lt;ref name="ND" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml;jsessionid=XT5YWS3SL104FQFIQMGCFFOAVCBQUIV0?xml=/arts/2001/10/04/bfsf4.xml ''Telegraph''].

==Career==

===Early career===

While attending [[:es:Instituto de arte cinematográfico de Avellaneda|IDAC]], Martel directed the animated short films ''El 56'' ("The 56") in 1988 and ''Piso 24'' ("24th Floor") in 1989.

As a film student at [[:es:Escuela Nacional de Experimentación y Realización Cinematográfica|ENERC]], Martel directed ''No te la llevarás, maldito'' ("You Won’t Get Her, Bastard," 1989), a short film about a jealous boy who fantasizes about killing his mother’s boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=You Won't Get Her, Bastard (1989) |url=https://letterboxd.com/film/you-wont-get-her-bastard/ |website=[[Letterboxd]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=en |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=No te la llevarás, maldito (C) (1989) |url=https://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film780001.html |website=[[FilmAffinity]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=es |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film scholar Deborah Martin wrote that in the film, “there is an exploration of the subversive power of children that would become a crucial feature of [Martel’s] later work, as a little boy's murderous [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal feelings]] towards his mother's lover are fully unleashed in a fantasy he lives out through his drawings.”&lt;ref name="DMCLM"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Deborah |title=The cinema of Lucrecia Martel |date=2016 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |location=U.K. |isbn=9780719090349 |format=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another short film Martel directed as a student is ''La otra'' ("The Other," 1990), a documentary about a man who talks about the joys and sorrows of his life as a [[transvestism|transvestite]] as he dresses up as a woman to sing tangos at a nightclub.&lt;ref name="MY" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La otra (1990) |url=https://letterboxd.com/film/la-otra-1990/ |website=[[Letterboxd]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=en |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, Martel directed ''Besos rojos'' ("Red Kisses," 1991), a short film based on a real-life police case between three lovers caught in a love triangle.&lt;ref name="NMF"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nueva mirada femenina para ver el cine argentino |url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/73675-nueva-mirada-femenina-para-ver-el-cine-argentino |website=[[La Nación]] |accessdate=29 July 2018 |location=Argentina |language=es |format=Web |date=27 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martel says that “just when [she] was starting to think that [a career in] film was impossible, that it was time for [her] to get a (real) job,” she entered a public script competition organized by the [[National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts|Argentine National Film Board (INCAA)]], the grand prize for which was the budget to produce a short film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historias Breves 2017 |url=http://www.incaa.gov.ar/concursos/cerrados/historias-breves-2017 |website=[[National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts|Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales (INCAA)]] |accessdate=23 August 2018 |language=es |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martel won the contest and, as a result, was able to produce her breakout film ''[[:es:Rey Muerto (cortometraje)|Rey muerto]]'' ("Dead King," 1995), a violent western about a woman who escapes her abusive, alcoholic husband with her three children in a small town called Rey Muerto in provincial [[Salta|Salta, Argentina]].&lt;ref name="MY" /&gt; It went on to win Best Short Film at the 1995 [[Havana Film Festival]].

''Rey muerto'' was exhibited in Argentina as part of a larger omnibus film called ''[[:es:Historias breves|Historias breves]]'' ("Short Stories," 1995). Martel explains that this compilation film was “unprecedented in the country” and came about after all the directors of the other winning short films in the script contest banded together and visited the INCAA headquarters in Buenos Aires repeatedly to ask the contest organizers to premiere all the short films as a string of films in a theater. Martel says that she and her fellow filmmakers “sat for hours until [the contest organizers] would meet with us. We argued that it was a waste of state funding if they didn’t exhibit the finished films.” As a result, the films were exhibited on the dedicated screens of the national public circuit run by INCAA.&lt;ref name="PJS" /&gt; Martel says that the premiere of ''Historias breves'' was "very successful" and drew 10,000 viewers. "It also inspired people," she says, "to study filmmaking and to start making shorts. It was a really important phenomenon in spiritual terms. Curiously, many of the directors who began their careers at the time—’95 or ’96—are still making films today. That event inaugurated the activity of a lot of directors, and also a lot of young people’s interest in film." Film scholar Haden Guest says it helped inaugurate the [[Cinema of Argentina#Contemporary cinema|New Argentine Cinema]] and “is really where the [movement] began.”&lt;ref name="HG" /&gt; 

Martel says that “thanks to ''Rey muerto'', [she] started to get jobs in television.”&lt;ref name="HG" /&gt; From 1995 to 1999 she directed the unconventional children's program ''[[:es:Magazine For Fai|Magazine For Fai]]'', in which child actors performed in different sketch comedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magazine For Fai (Serie de TV) (1995) |url=https://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film660201.html |website=[[FilmAffinity]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=es |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview with ''[[ABC Color]]'', Martel says the show “became a cult for children.... It was not commercially known, but there are a lot of young people who saw it. Many of its actors are now stars of Argentine cinema.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Coronel |first1=Jorge |title=Lucrecia Martel: "La industria del cine se puso un poco torpe" |url=http://www.abc.com.py/especiales/fin-de-semana/lucrecia-martel-la-industria-del-cine-se-puso-un-poco-torpe-649470.html |website=[[ABC Color]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |location=Paraguay |language=es |format=Web |date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also made two documentaries for television: ''Encarnación Ezcurra'' (1998), about the [[Encarnación Ezcurra|eponymous wife]] of Argentine politician and army officer [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], and ''Las dependencias (The Outbuildings)'' (1999), a reconstruction of the life of the celebrated Argentine short fiction writer [[Silvina Ocampo]], which draws on the testimonies of Ocampo's servants and friends.&lt;ref name="IFFR"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lucrecia Martel |url=https://iffr.com/en/persons/lucrecia-martel |website=[[International Film Festival Rotterdam]] (IFFR) |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=en |format=Web |date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DMCLM" /&gt;

===Salta trilogy===

In 1999, Martel's screenplay for her debut feature film ''[[La Ciénaga (film)|La Ciénaga]]'' ("The Swamp," 2011) won the Sundance Institute/NHK Award, which honors and supports emerging independent filmmakers "who contribute to the world's visual culture and promote cultural exchanges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=NHK, Sundance honor int'l filmmakers|url=http://variety.com/2003/film/markets-festivals/nhk-sundance-honor-int-l-filmmakers-1117878958/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=6 May 2018|date=17 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is "Sundance Institute/NHK Award"? |url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/sun-asia/sundance/about/index_e.html |website=[[NHK|NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation)]] |accessdate=26 August 2018 |language=en |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury recommended that she re-write the script to follow a more traditional structure around one or two protagonists, but Martel chose instead to retain the script's diffuse nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Deborah|title=The cinema of Lucrecia Martel|date=2016|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|location=U.K.|pages=32|isbn=9780719090349|format=Print|chapter=''La Ciénaga'': Distanciation and Embodiment}}&lt;/ref&gt; To cast the film's child actors, Martel held 2,400 auditions, 1,600 of which she recorded on video in a garage near her home in [[Salta]].&lt;ref name="LM" /&gt; 

In 2001, Martel was selected for the 3rd edition of the [[Cannes Film Festival]] [[Cinéfondation]] [[artist-in-residence]] program, designed to inspire and support young international filmmakers working on their first or second feature film. As part of the program, Martel lived in Paris for four and a half months, attended forums and worked with film industry professionals in developing her second feature film, ''[[The Holy Girl]]'', which premiered in 2004.&lt;ref name="LMCFF"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lucrecia MARTEL |url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/artist/lucrecia-martel |website=[[Cannes Film Festival|Festival de Cannes]] |accessdate=26 August 2018 |language=en |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Residence &gt; Presentation |url=http://www.cinefondation.com/en/generalinformation |website=[[Cinéfondation]] – [[Cannes Film Festival|Festival de Cannes]] |accessdate=26 August 2018 |language=en |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Residence &gt; The Programme |url=http://www.cinefondation.com/en/residenceprogram |website=[[Cinéfondation]] – [[Cannes Film Festival|Festival de Cannes]] |accessdate=26 August 2018 |language=en |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with ''[[The Headless Woman (2008 film)|The Headless Woman]]'' (2008), Martel's first three feature films make up what [[Gatopardo (magazine)|''Gatopardo'' magazine]] calls "a trilogy dedicated to women and Salta," writing, "The three scripts were written by her, the three films were filmed in Salta, and, in all, always, something unexpected alters family cosmology. The characters see the life that they have armed, but, although a magma of bad omens descends on them, they do not react. In ''[[La Ciénaga (film)|La Ciénaga]]'', it is a domestic accident that the mother of a large family suffers. In ''[[The Holy Girl|The Holy Girl (La niña santa)]]'', it is a doctor who arrives in a town and stays in a hotel where the owner lives with her teenage daughter, a student of a religious school. In ''[[The Headless Woman (2008 film)|The Headless Woman (La mujer sin cabeza)]]'', it is an accident on a deserted route and a family cover-up to hide guilt and tragedy.”

“Martel’s filmic trilogy about life in the province of Salta, Argentina," writes film scholar Paul A. Schroeder Rodríguez, "explores the country’s incomplete transition to democracy from the perspective of strong, intelligent, and [[social privilege|socially privileged]] female protagonists who do not conform to dominant [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] values: first during childhood in ''La Ciénaga'' (''The Swamp'', 2001), then during sexual awakening in ''La niña santa'' (''The Holy Girl'', 2004); and finally in adulthood, in ''La mujer sin cabeza'' (''The Headless Woman'', 2008)”.... Martel’s work is finely tuned to the particular rhythms and values of provincial middle-class Argentina, a world whose economic stagnation and moral bankruptcy she dissects through narratives that play on viewers’ sympathies by constantly shifting between favorable and unfavorable perspectives on her characters.”&lt;ref name="PASR"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schroeder Rodríguez |first1=Paul A. |title=Latin American Cinema: A Comparative History |date=2016 |publisher=U of California |location=Oakland, CA |pages=266–81 |isbn=9780520288638 |format=Print |chapter=The Rise of the Woman Director: Lucrecia Martel's Salta Trilogy (2001-8)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical reception====

[[Filmmaker (magazine)|''Filmmaker'' magazine]] wrote, “[Martel’s] debut feature ''La Ciénaga'' premiered at [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]], won the [[Alfred Bauer Prize|Alfred Bauer Award]] at [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], and received rave reviews wherever it played. Martel’s 2004 follow-up, ''The Holy Girl'', about the sexual and religious passions of two Argentinian teenage girls, premiered at [[2004 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and consolidated Martel’s reputation as one of the finest emerging talents in [[world cinema]].”&lt;ref name="ND" /&gt;

Film scholar Paul Julian Smith wrote that although “Martel has had to rely rather on a cocktail of small, mainly European, production companies” to fund her films, “industrial constraints and transnational flow have not compromised [her] artistic individuality.... [Her] severe [[art film|art movie]] aesthetics identify her with other [[transnational cinema|transnational]] [[auteur|auteurs]] favoured on the festival circuit.”&lt;ref name="PJS" /&gt; 

''La Ciénaga'' (2001) received numerous international awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La Ciénaga (2001) Awards |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240419/awards |website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=27 August 2018 |language=en |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Holy Girl'' and ''The Headless Woman'' were nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the Cannes Film Festivals of 2004 and 2008, respectively.

In a survey of 35 prominent film critics, scholars and industry professionals based in [[New York City]], all three feature films figured among the top ten Latin American films of the decade, with ''La Ciénaga'' taking top place, beating the better-known (and more accessible) works of the Mexican male triad of [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], [[Alfonso Cuarón]], and [[Guillermo del Toro]].&lt;ref name="PJS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematropical.com/programming.php?pid=3 |title=The Ten Best Latin American Films of the Decade |accessdate=7 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206031105/http://www.cinematropical.com/programming.php?pid=3 |archivedate=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2016, ''[[The Headless Woman (2008 film)|The Headless Woman]]'' ranked #89 on [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]], polled from 177 film critics around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |website=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)]] |accessdate=27 August 2018 |language=en |format=Web |date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Academic attention====

Martel's work has also attracted a good deal of academic attention. Many scholars have written extensively regarding the films’ critiques of gender and sexuality, as well as its bold depictions of class, race, nationality, and colonialism. 

Film scholar Deborah Shaw argues that the trilogy “presents an anatomy of Argentine, [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] female identity” and “explores the micropolitics of gender, sexuality and location, rather than national narratives of [[oppression]] and [[transformative social change|collective liberation]].”&lt;ref name="DSID"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shaw |first1=Deborah |editor1-last=Martin |editor1-first=Deborah |editor2-last=Shaw |editor2-first=Deborah |title=Latin American Women Filmmakers: Production, Politics, Poetics |publisher=[[I.B.

Paul A. Schroeder Rodríguez described the films as “[[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] with a vengeance” and argues that “each of the films is set up as a dialectic between a [[desire#Film|desiring]] female subject and the [[cultural hegemony|hegemonic]] [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] reality.”&lt;ref name="PASR" /&gt;

Film scholar Deborah Martin wrote [http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780719090349/ a full-length book] on Martel's oeuvre, published in May 2016, in which she argues that Martel’s films “demonstrate possibilities of rupture and escape through her cinematic recreations of rebellious young girls’ forbidden desires.... Despite the fact that these films depict in detail structures of social and political oppression, desire acts as an uncontrollable and multiple force which can overcome these structures.”&lt;ref name="DMDS"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Deborah |last2=Shaw |first2=Deborah |title=Latin American Women Filmmakers: Production, Politics, Poetics |date=2017 |publisher=[[I.B.

===Post-trilogy work===

In May 2008, Martel was reported as slated to direct the film adaptation of ''[[The Eternaut]]'', the very popular Argentine science fiction comic strip created by [[Héctor Germán Oesterheld]] and [[Francisco Solano López (comics)|Francisco Solano López]] in 1957 about a toxic snowfall and alien invasion of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lucrecia Martel filmará "El Eternauta" |url=http://www.perfil.com/noticias/contenidos/2008/05/13/noticia_0021.phtml |website=[[Perfil]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=es |date=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MY" /&gt; In October 2008, Martel said of the project to ''[[Bomb (magazine)|BOMB Magazine]]'', “I sent my idea of how to adapt it to the producer, and he was interested. I also know that members of the Oesterheld family liked it.”&lt;ref name="HG" /&gt; According to film scholar Deborah Martin, Martel was adapting it as a "meditation on power and social class in Buenos Aires." In 2009, however, the project was dropped, after significant work had been undertaken on it, due to conceptual differences with the producer.&lt;ref name="DMCLM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Makovsky |first1=Pablo |title=Historias de crímenes de clase |url=http://www.lacapital.com.ar/ed_senales/2009/12/edicion_60/contenidos/noticia_5001.html |website=[[La Capital]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223134802/http://www.lacapital.com.ar/ed_senales/2009/12/edicion_60/contenidos/noticia_5001.html |archivedate=23 February 2012 |location=Argentina |format=Web |date=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martel’s 2010 short film ''Nueva Agirópolis'' ("New Argirópolis") metaphorically represents indigenous people’s resistance to capture and interrogation by the Argentine state&lt;ref name="DMDS" /&gt; as well as the inevitable [[cultural globalization#Hybridization|cultural hybridization]] that ensues between the two nations despite that resistance.&lt;ref name="ERCV"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Russo |first1=Eduardo |last2=Vallina |first2=Carlos |title=[en primera persona] Lucrecia Martel |journal=Tram[p]as de la Comunicación y la Cultura |date=May 2012 |issue=70 |url=http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/bitstream/handle/10915/35270/Documento_completo.pdf?sequence=1 |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=Spanish |format=Journal PDF |issn=2314-274X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes its name from the 1850 book ''[[Argirópolis]]'', written by former Argentine [[President of Argentina|President]] and political activist [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], in which Argirópolis is the name of the capital city of a [[utopia|utopian]] democratic [[confederation|confederacy]] between [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pinna |first1=Pablo |title=Argirópolis, la capital soñada por Sarmiento para unir Argentina, Uruguay y Paraguay |url=https://www.vix.com/es/mundo/182625/argiropolis-la-capital-sonada-por-sarmiento-para-unir-argentina-uruguay-y-paraguay |website=[[Batanga Media|VIX]] |accessdate=26 August 2018 |language=es |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short film was commissioned by the [[Ministry of Culture (Argentina)|Argentine Ministry of Culture]] as part of the [[Argentina Bicentennial|Bicentennial celebrations]]&lt;ref name="DMJLACS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Deborah |title=Lucrecia Martel's ''Nueva Argirópolis'': Rivers, Rumours and Resistance |journal=Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies |date=1 September 2016 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=449–465 |doi=10.1080/13569325.2016.1167018 |language=English |format=Submitted manuscript|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1493022/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and shown in theaters as part of the larger [[anthology film]] ''[[:es:25 Miradas - 200 Minutos|25 miradas, 200 minutos]]'' ("25 Looks, 200 Minutes," 2010), an introspective look at the history of Argentina from the point of view of 25 film directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nueva Argirópolis (C) (2010) |url=https://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film546350.html |website=[[FilmAffinity]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=es |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=25 miradas, 200 minutos (2010) |url=https://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film500920.html |website=[[FilmAffinity]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=es |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Martel's short film ''Muta'' ("Mutate") premiered at an invitation-only event in [[Beverly Hills]] attended by stars like [[Emma Roberts]], [[Hailee Steinfeld]], [[Ashley Tisdale]], [[Cat Deeley]], [[Diane Kruger]], [[Jeremy Renner]], and [[Marilyn Manson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Steinberg |first1=Dan |title='Muta' by Miu Miu |url=http://www.latimes.com/la-et-muta-premiere-miu-miu-pictures-photogallery.html |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=29 August 2018 |language=en |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Miu Miu Women’s Tales: ''MUTA'' by Lucrecia Martel |url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/news/a5456/miu-miu-womens-tales-muta-by-lucrecia-martel/ |website=[[Harper's Bazaar#Harper’s Bazaar UK|Harper’s Bazaar UK]] |accessdate=29 August 2018 |language=en |date=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned by [[Miu Miu]], the Italian [[high fashion]] company owned by [[Prada]], the film is the second installment of the company's ''[[Women's Tales]]'' film series, which consists of short films produced in conjunction with high-profile international female directors.

In her short film ''Leguas'' ("Leagues," 2015), Martel explores the subject of academic exclusion in Argentina’s indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="MY" /&gt; Named after an [[league (unit)|archaic unit of measurement]], the film depicts how education, though a social tool, can also create division and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leagues (2015) |url=https://letterboxd.com/film/leagues/ |website=[[Letterboxd]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=en |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was distributed as part of the anthology documentary film ''[[El aula vacía]]'' ("The Empty Classroom," 2015), in which eleven award-winning directors examine the underlying reasons why nearly one out of every two Latin American students never graduates high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leguas |url=https://homemcr.org/film/leguas/ |website=[[HOME (Manchester)|HOME]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |location=Manchester, U.K. |language=en |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=El aula vacía (2015) |url=https://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film333591.html |website=[[FilmAffinity]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=es |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent career===

Martel’s fourth feature film ''[[Zama (2017 film)|Zama]]'' premiered at the [[74th Venice International Film Festival|Venice International Film Festival]] in August 2017. An adaptation of [[Antonio di Benedetto]]’s 1956 [[Zama (novel)|novel of the same name]], it narrates the tragic story of Don Diego de Zama, a Spanish colonial functionary stationed in [[Asunción|Asunción, Paraguay]] who waits, in vain, for his superiors to authorize his return home to his wife and family. It was an international co-production between eight countries: Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Mexico, France, the U.S., the Netherlands, and Portugal, with stars like [[Pedro Almodóvar]], [[Gael García Bernal]], and [[Danny Glover]] among its long list of producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=de la Fuente |first1=Anna Marie |title=Co-Productions on the Rise in Brazil |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/global/co-productions-brazil-1202434200/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=27 August 2018 |language=English |format=Web |date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JH"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoberman |first1=J. |title=Lucrecia Martel: A Director Who Confounds and Thrills |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/movies/lucrecia-martel-zama-argentina.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=27 August 2018 |language=en |format=Web |date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went on to screen at the [[2017 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] and [[New York Film Festival]] and received widespread acclaim from critics. 

Mexican news magazine ''[[Gatopardo (magazine)|Gatopardo]]'' wrote of the film, “Like the other characters of Lucrecia Martel, only now in the late eighteenth century, Diego de Zama is unable to take charge of his own life; his fate is left in the hands of others. The identity that he has imposed on himself and that others have imposed on him is his prison.”&lt;ref name="MY" /&gt; [[:es:Rolling Stone (Argentina)|''Rolling Stone'' of Argentina]] wrote, “[''Zama''] is not an easy bone to crack.

She’s too good a director to be sat on the sidelines for long and ''Zama'' may just be her left-field masterpiece; a picture that’s antic, sensual and strange, with a top-note of menace and a malarial air.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brooks |first1=Xan |title=Zama review – Lucrecia Martel emerges from the wilderness with a strange, sensual wonder |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/31/zama-review-lucrecia-martel-emerges-from-the-wilderness-with-a-strange-sensual-wonder |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=29 June 2018 |location=London, U.K. |language=en |format=Web |date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was chosen to represent Argentina in the [[List of submissions to the 90th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar]] and [[32nd Goya Awards|Goya Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mango |first1=Agustin |title=Oscars: Argentina Selects 'Zama' for Foreign-Language Category |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-argentina-selects-zama-foreign-language-category-1044357 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=26 August 2018 |language=en |format=Web |date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter of which it received the nomination for [[Goya Award for Best Spanish Language Foreign Film|Best Spanish Language Foreign Film]].

In May 2018, Martel was [[artist-in-residence|filmmaker-in-residence]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where she offered a sequence of seminars on her filmmaking practice to students, staff, and the university community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=‘The greatest director in the world right now’ begins residency at Centre for Film and Screen |url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/the-greatest-director-in-the-world-right-now-begins-residency-at-centre-for-film-and-screen |website=[[University of Cambridge]] |accessdate=29 August 2018 |language=en |format=Web |date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martel [[coming out|came out]] to her family just days before the 2001 premiere of ''[[La Ciénaga (film)|La Ciénaga]]'' because she was worried about the implicit [[homosexuality]] depicted in the film. Her mother reacted lovingly to the news and said she knew since Martel was 7 years old. 

In February 2016, while editing ''[[Zama (2017 film)|Zama]]'', Martel was diagnosed with [[uterine cancer]].

'''''Merelaus the Emperor''''' is the name of one of the stories from the 13/14th c. collection ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]''. It tells of the patience and virtue of the wife of Merelaus the Emperor, who is betrayed successively by her husband's brother, a steward in an earl's household, a thief she rescued, and a ship captain. The tale was retold by [[Christine de Pisan]] and by [[Thomas Hoccleve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blamires|first1=Alcuin|last2=Pratt|first2=Karen|last3=Marx|first3=C.

==Early life==
Levi was born and raised in [[Surrey]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/02/micachu-shapes-review-renaissance-woman-mica-levi|title=Micachu and the Shapes review – renaissance woman goes back to basics|last=Thompson|first=Ben|date=2015-08-02|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name "interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clashmusic.com/features/micachu-interview|title=Micachu Interview _ Features _ Clash Magazine|last=Diver|first=Mike|date=2009-05-28|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of two musicians. She is half Romanian.&lt;ref name "interview"/&gt; Levi started writing and playing music at the age of four. 

==Music==
Levi moved to London in her teens and performed as a DJ and released a [[mixtape]] titled ''Filthy Friends'', which was posted on her official [[Myspace]] page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2016/03/11/micachu-teams-up-with-brother-may-for-may-and-meeks-ep|title=Micachu teams up with Brother May for 'May And Meeks' EP|website=DIY|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Filthy Friends'' she enlisted the help of friends and musicians of various backgrounds including MCs Baker Trouble, Brother May, Man Like Me &amp; [[Ghostpoet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/ghostpoet-interview-id-do-music-for-a-cheese-and-onion-sandwich-10060068.html|title=Rapper Ghostpoet talks about his struggle for success|date=2015-02-21|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; singer-songwriter [[Jack Peñate]], jazz band Troyka, London pop-band [[Golden Silvers]] as well as producers [[Kwes]] and [[Toddla T]]. Following its release, ''Filthy Friends'' became sought after on the [[London]] club scene.

While a student at Guildhall, Levi was commissioned to write an orchestral piece for the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] which was performed at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, Tim. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/4839344/Micachu-and-the-Shapes-the-Shape-of-things-to-come.html Micachu and the Shapes: The Shape of Things To Come], "[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]], 4 March 2009"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Micachu at Crash Mansion 2008.jpg|thumb|Performing in [[New York City]], October 2008]]

Levi was an Artist-in-Residence at the Southbank Centre in London in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/about-us/resident-orchestras-and-associate-artists |title=Resident Orchestras &amp; Artists in Residence |publisher=Southbank Centre |date= |accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levi co-wrote and produced Tirzah's ''I'm Not Dancing'' EP, which was released by Greco-Roman Records in August 2013, to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15810-im-not-dancing/ |title=Tirzah: "I'm Not Dancing" &amp;#124; Tracks |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2013-08-01 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levi contributed to the soundtrack for Phil Collins' ''Ceremony'' at Manchester International Festival 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mif.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MIF17-Headline-release-1.pdf|title=Manchester International Festival Full Programme Press Release 2017|last=|first=|date=November 2017|website=MIF.co.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micachu and the Shapes===
Levi formed a band called Micachu and the Shapes, which included Raisa Khan on keyboards and Marc Pell on drums. They signed to [[Matthew Herbert|Accidental Records]]. With the Shapes, Levi's focus has been on experimental pop music. Most of this music prominently features an acoustic half-guitar with various [[Alternate tunings|non-standard tunings]], extensive distortion, and use of noise and found-object elements, as well as occasionally unusual time signatures. Despite these experimental leanings, the artist categorizes her output with the Shapes as pop music.

Their debut album, ''Jewellery'', produced with influential electronic musician [[Matthew Herbert]], was recorded around Mica's composition studies at [[Guildhall School]]. Advance copies of the record reached the press in early 2009, and generated positive feedback. In the wake of this growing buzz, Micachu and the Shapes were signed to [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughtraderecords.com/artist/micachu|title=Rough Trade Records|last=Records|first=Rough Trade|website=Rough Trade Records|access-date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; who released ''Jewellery'' on 9 March 2009. Drowned In Sound consequently hailed the record as "thrillingly improbable pop made by a grade-A maverick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ubaghs |first=Charles |url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/14119/reviews/4136399 |title=Album Review: Micachu - Jewellery / Releases / Releases // Drowned In Sound |website=Drownedinsound.com |date=2009-03-17 |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the band received a grant from the [[PRS for Music|PRS for Music Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, Marc. [http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7776-whats-the-matter-with-sweden/2/ "What's the Matter with Sweden?" in Pitchfork.com] 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Micachu and the Shapes toured widely throughout the UK in 2008, including performances at [[Bestival]] and [[V Festival]]. The band played in the US at the [[CMJ Music Marathon]] in [[New York City]] and [[SXSW]] in Austin, Texas. They also performed on the Main Stage of the [[Siren Music Festival]] at [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]] in July 2009. Touring continued throughout Europe and North America in the summer and fall of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/micayomusic |title=Micachu &amp;#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos |website=Myspace.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spring of 2010, Micachu and the Shapes supported [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]] on tour throughout North America.

The band performed with the [[London Sinfonietta]] at Kings Place, London in May 2010 and in March 2011 released the live recording as the album "Chopped and Screwed".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.roughtraderecords.com/micachu/3656/micachu-the-shapes-and-london-sinfonietta-present-chopped-screwed Micachu and the Shapes and London Sinfonietta present: CHOPPED &amp; SCREWED]", ''Rough Trade Records''.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike their previous effort, the recording largely avoids pop sensibilities in favor of a slower, hip-hop indebted style and repetitive, discordant string arrangements. The band were chosen by [[Animal Collective]] to perform at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival that they curated in May 2011 in Minehead, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atpfestival.com/events/atpanimalcollective.php |title=ATP curated by Animal Collective - All Tomorrow's Parties |publisher=Atpfestival.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The follow-up to their debut, ''[[Never (album)|Never]]'', was released on 23 July 2012.

The band released the album ''Good Sad Happy Bad'' on 11 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.metacritic.com/music/good-sad-happy-bad/micachu-the-shapes/critic-reviews |title = ''Good Sad Happy Bad'' critics reviews |date = September 10, 2015 |accessdate = September 12, 2016 |publisher = Mertacritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/arts/music/pop-and-jazz-listings-and-albums-for-the-fall-season.html "Pop and Jazz Listings and Albums for the Fall Season"]. ''New York Times'', SEPT. 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, the band announced on social media that they were changing their name to Good Sad Happy Bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date=March 23, 2016 |title=good sad happy bad |medium=Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a7HXJMHz2g |access-date=April 1, 2017 |quote=we just wanted to tell you that rather than being a recording "good sad happy bad" is the new name of our band.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10153218749922242&amp;id=10361552241&amp;match=aGFwcHksZ29vZCxzYWQsYmFk |title=Micachu shared a Page |author={{Facebook|Micachu-10361552241|Micachu}} |date=March 23, 2016 |website=[[Facebook]] |access-date=April 1, 2017 |quote=Our band name is now GOOD SAD HAPPY BAD and we did this because we feel our last record was more than just a recording.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film scores ==
Levi's first major film score was for [[Jonathan Glazer]]'s 2014 film ''[[Under the Skin (2013 film)|Under the Skin]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/15/mica-levi-under-the-skin-soundtrack|title=How Mica Levi got Under The Skin of her first film soundtrack|last=Levi|first=Mica|date=2014-03-15|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is based on the [[Under the Skin (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Michel Faber]] and stars Scarlett Johansson. Produced at age 26 and created in collaboration with Glazer, Levi's film score themes are so tightly woven into the film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19239-mica-levi-under-the-skin-ost/|title=Mica Levi: Under the Skin OST Album Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they give a symbiotic quality, in which the aural feels inseparable from the visual.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/artisans/production/music-sound-arrival-jackie-1201892755/|title=‘Arrival,’ ‘Jackie’ Composers Push Boundaries of Music and Sound Design|last=Tapley|first=Kristopher|date=2016-10-19|newspaper=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score was widely acclaimed for pushing the boundaries of music and sound design and Levi was nominated for multiple awards. She won Best Composer at the 2014 [[European Film Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/micachu/81948|title=Mica Levi on scoring 'Under the Skin': 'I dreamt the world came out of Scarlett Johansson's face' {{!}} NME.COM|last=NME.COM|website=NME.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tied with [[Jonny Greenwood]] for Best Music/Score at the 2014 Los Angeles Film Critics Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lafca.net/years/2014.html |title=LAFCA |publisher=LAFCA |date= |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also nominated for the 2015 [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Award for Best Film Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2015/01/09/mica-levi-bafta-under-the-skin-score/|title=Mica Levi earns BAFTA nomination for Under The Skin score|website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Levi completed her second major film score, for [[Pablo Larraín]]'s [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] biopic ''[[Jackie (2016 film)|Jackie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/16/mica-levi-micachu-jackie-biopic-score/|title=Mica Levi scores Jackie Kennedy biopic starring Natalie Portman|date=August 16, 2016|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larraín had been a juror at the 2013 Venice Film Festival, and thought that ''Under the Skin'' deserved a film score prize. Composer [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], also on the jury, was enthralled by Levi’s bold score for the film, and he and Larraín spoke passionately of her accomplishment,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which led to the collaboration on ''Jackie''. Levi was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] at the [[89th Academy Awards]], making her the fifth woman nominated in the category,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/mica-levis-anti-musical-soundtracks |title=Mica Levi's Intensely Unconventional Film Scores |last=Beauman |first=Ned |date=February 23, 2017 |website=[[The New Yorker]] |access-date=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost to [[Justin Hurwitz]] for ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]''.

The '''Music Venue Trust''' is a British [[charitable organisation]] that was founded in January 2014 to help improve, maintain, and organise [[music venues]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The MVT also operates the Music Venues Alliance, a network of venues and other groups that aid the MVT, and the Trade Association of the Music Venues Alliance, which offers services that help venues that are members of the MVA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://musicvenuetrust.com |title=Music Venue Trust |last= |first= |date=2016 |website= Music Venue Trust |publisher= |access-date=29 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul McCartney]] has spoken out in support of the MVT, saying that "If we don’t support live music at this level then the future of music in general is in danger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://louderthanwar.com/paul-mccartney-speaks-support-music-venue-trust/ |title=paul McCartney speaks out in support of Music Venue Trust |last= |first= |date= 19 October 2016 |website=[[Louder Than War (website)|Louder than War]] |publisher= |access-date= 29 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

One of the key reasons for the foundation of the MVT was the closure of many music venues, such as Brighton's [[The Blind Tiger Club, Brighton|Blind Tiger Club]], due to noise complaints;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kentlive.news/noise-complaints-threaten-small-music-venues/story-22012513-detail/whatson/story.html#MkyZw6SfKdiYkcQ4.99 |title=Noise rows threaten small music venues, founders of The Forum claim - and 14,000 people agree|last= |first= |date=29 July 2014 |website= Kent And Sussex Courier |publisher=Kent Live |access-date= 29 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is especially important as noise complaints are becoming more frequent, as new laws have been introduced that make it easier to convert offices into housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/12/music-venue-trust-small-venues |title=Can the Music Venue Trust save Britain's pub circuit?|last=Hall |first=Josh |date=12 August 2014 |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher= Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date= 29 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another key concern that the MVT claims is facing venues is [[Arts Council England]]'s lack of funding for venues; Beverley Whitrick, Strategic Director of the MVT, said in 2017 she could not estimate how many clubs would close in the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/15/grassroots-music-venues-face-closure-as-funding-bid-fails |title=‘Slap in the face’: grassroots music venues face closure as funding bid fails|last=Doward |first=Jamie |date=15 July 2017 |website=The Guardian |publisher= Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date= 29 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiatives==

The MVA founded an international affiliate organisation in [[Austin, Texas]] in 2016, targeting state taxes that are seen as punitive towards local venues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7625236/music-venues-alliance-austin-trust-liquor-tax |title=U.K.'s Music Venue Trust Expands to Austin, Texas and Targets State Liquor Tax |last=Schneider |first=Marc |date=15 December 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher= Eldridge Industries |access-date= 29 August 2017 |quote=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [https://www.musicvenuealliance.co.nz/ MVA New Zealand] where they are fighting to have [http://musicvenuetrust.com/2014/09/what-is-agent-of-change-and-why-is-it-important/ Agent of Change] recognised and adopted. To clarify its political aims ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]], the MVT launched a "Manifesto for Music 2017" in May of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mia.org.uk/2017/05/music-venue-trust-publish-their-manifesto-for-music/ |title=Music Venue Trust publish their Manifesto for Music |last= |first= |date=23 May 2017 |website= Music Industries Association |publisher= |access-date= 29 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after the launch of the manifesto, in order to help fight the issues and closures that music venues in the UK were facing, the MVT announced that they would cooperate with Ticketweb, part of [[Live Nation Entertainment]], to sell "Grassroots Venues Tickets", which help fund the MVT's efforts, as part of the [[service charge]] is donated to the MVT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investors.livenationentertainment.com/news-center/news-center-details/2017/Music-Venue-Trust-and-Ticketweb-Launch-Grassroots-Venues-Tickets-Website/default.aspx |title=Music Venue Trust and Ticketweb Launch Grassroots Venues Tickets Website |last= |first= |date=July 2017 |website= [[Live Nation Entertainment]] |publisher= |access-date= 29 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11876">'''Nature writing''' is [[nonfiction]] or [[fiction]] [[prose]] or [[poetry]] about the natural environment. Nature writing encompasses a wide variety of works, ranging from those that place primary emphasis on natural history facts (such as field guides) to those in which philosophical interpretation predominate. It includes [[natural history]] essays, poetry, essays of solitude or escape, as well as travel and adventure writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Lyon|first=Thomas Jefferson|publisher=Milkweed Editions|date=2001|title=This Incomparable Land: A Guide to American Nature Writing|ISBN=978-1571312563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nature writing often draws heavily on scientific information and facts about the natural world; at the same time, it is frequently written in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] and incorporates personal observations of and philosophical reflections upon nature.

Modern nature writing traces its roots to the works of [[natural history]] that were popular in the second half of the 18th century and throughout the 19th. An important early figures was the "[[parson-naturalist]]" [[Gilbert White]] (1720 – 1793),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=Edmund|year=1903|title=English Literature: From Milton to Johnson|chapter="Gilbert White"|location=London|publisher=William Heinemann|pages=375–378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUAOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA375}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneering [[England|English]] [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[Ornithology|ornithologist]]. He is best known for his ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' (1789).

[[William Bartram]] (1739 – 1823) is a significant early American pioneer naturalist who first work was published in 1791.

==Pioneers==
Gilbert White is regarded by many as [[England]]'s first [[ecologist]], and one of those who shaped the modern attitude of respect for nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, D.L., Heinsohn, R.G. and Lindenmayer, D.B. 2005. Ecology. pp. 97-112 in R.Q. Grafton, L. Robin and R.J. Wasson (eds.), ''Understanding the Environment: Bridging the Disciplinary Divides''. Sydney, NSW: University of New South Wales Press, (p. 99).&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the [[earthworm]]: "Earthworms, though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of nature, yet, if lost, would make a lamentable chasm. [...] worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation, which would proceed but lamely without them"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z_YVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA205 Letter LXVII] (1777)&lt;/ref&gt; White and [[William Markwick]] collected records of the dates of emergence of more than 400 plant and animal species in [[Hampshire]] and [[Sussex]] between 1768 and 1793, which was summarised in ''The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne'', as the earliest and latest dates for each event over the 25-year period, are among the earliest examples of modern [[phenology]].

The tradition of [[Parson-naturalist|clerical naturalists]] predates White and can be traced back to some monastic writings of the Middle Ages, although some argue that their writings about animals and plants cannot be correctly classified as natural history. Notable early parson-naturalists were William Turner (1508–1568), John Ray (1627–1705), William Derham (1657–1735).

William Bertram, in 1773, embarked on a four year journey through eight southern American colonies. Bartram made many drawings and took notes on the native [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and the [[Native Americans in the United States|native American Indians]]. In [[Timeline of Florida History|1774]], he explored the St. Johns River.&lt;ref&gt;Bartram, William. ''The Travels of William Bartram, Naturalist Edition''. Edited with Commentary and an Annotated Index by Francis Harper. University of Georgia Press, Athens, 1998,  p118&lt;/ref&gt; William Bartram wrote of his experiences exploring the Southeast in his book known today as ''[[Bartram's Travels]]'', published in 1791. [[Ephraim George Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis]], in their book, ''[[Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley]]'', name Bartram as "the first naturalist who penetrated the dense tropical forests of Florida."&lt;ref name=Squier&gt;{{cite book|last=Squier|first=E.G.|title=Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley|year=1848|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|location=Washington, D.C.|page=46|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4301/view/1/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gilbert White and William Bertram, other significant writers include American [[ornithologist]] [[John James Audubon]] (1785 – 1851), [[Charles Darwin]]( (1809 – 1882),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=Edmund|year=1906|title=English Literature: From the Age of Johnson to the Age of Tennyson|chapter=CHARLES DARWIN|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan Co|pages=298–302|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zn3gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA298}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Jefferies]] (1848 – 1887), [[Susan Fenimore Cooper]] (1813 – 1894), mother of American nature writting, and [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817 – 1862), who is often considered the father of modern American nature writing, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803 – 1882) [[John Burroughs]], [[John Muir]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Rachel Carson]], [[M. Krishnan]], and [[Edward Abbey]] (although he rejected the term for himself).

Another important early work is ''[[A History of British Birds]]''  by [[Thomas Bewick]], published in two volumes. Volume 1, "Land Birds", appeared in 1797. Volume 2, "Water Birds", appeared in 1804.  The book was effectively the first "[[field guide]]" for non-specialists. Bewick provides an accurate illustration of each species, from life if possible, or from skins. The common and scientific name(s) are listed, citing the naming authorities. The bird is described, with its distribution and behaviour, often with extensive quotations from printed sources or correspondents. Critics note Bewick's skill as a [[naturalist]] as well as an engraver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://britishbirds.co.uk/article/thomas-bewick-the-complete-illustrative-work-by-nigel-tattersfield/|title=Thomas Bewick: the complete illustrative work, by Nigel Tattersfield - British Birds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Europe==
Some important contemporary figures in Britain include [[Richard Mabey]], [[Roger Deakin]], [[Mark Cocker]], and [[Oliver Rackham]]. Rackham's books included ''Ancient Woodland'' (1980) and ''The History of the Countryside'' (1986). Richard Maybey has been involved with radio and television programmes on nature, and his book ''Nature Cure'', describes his experiences and recovery from depression in the context of man’s relationship with landscape and nature. He has also edited and introduced editions of Richard Jefferies, Gilbert White, [[Flora Thompson]] and [[Peter Matthiessen]]. Mark Crocker has written extensively for British newspapers and magazines and his books include [[Birds Britannica]] (with Richard Mabey) (2005). and ''Crow Country'' (2007). He frequently writes about modern responses to the wild, whether found in landscape, human societies or in other species. Roger Deakin was an English writer, documentary-maker and environmentalist. In 1999, Deakin's acclaimed book ''Waterlog'' was published.&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/08/archive-environmentalist-roger-deakin-university?INTCMP=SRCH|title= Archives of environmentalist Roger Deakin given to university|date= 8 May 2010|publisher=Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired in part by the short story ''[[The Swimmer (short story)|The Swimmer]]'' by [[John Cheever]],&lt;ref&gt;Subsequently made into [[The Swimmer (1968 film)|a film]] starring [[Burt Lancaster]].&lt;/ref&gt; it describes his experiences of '[[Open water swimming|wild swimming]]' in Britain's rivers and lakes and advocates [[Freedom to roam|open access]] to the countryside and waterways.  Deakin's book ''Wildwood'' appeared posthumously in 2007. It describes a series of journeys across the globe that Deakin made to meet people whose lives are intimately connected to trees and wood.

In 2017 the German book publishing company [[Matthes &amp; Seitz Berlin]] started to grant the [[Deutscher Preis für Nature Writing|German Award for Nature Writing]], an annual literary award for writers in German language that excellently fulfil the criteria of the literary genre. It comes with a price money of 10.000 Euro and additionallly an [[artist in residency]] grant of six weeks at the International Academy for Nature Conservation of Germany on the German island [[Vilm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boersenblatt.net/artikel-preis_fuer_nature_writing_2018.1492164.html |title= Preis für Nature Writing 2018: Sabine Scho und Christian Lehnert ausgezeichnet |date=2018-07-13 |website=boersenblatt.net |access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Council]] in 2018 is offering an education bursary and workshops to six young German authors dedicated to Nature writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britishcouncil.de/uk-germany-2018/writers-nature-stipendium |title=Writers by Nature: Stipendium |date=2018 |website=britishcouncil.de |access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2602">'''Non-dance''' is a [[choreography|choreographic]] movement within [[contemporary dance]]. It began in the 1990, principally in France. Its practitioners see it as a transdisciplinary movement, dispensing with the movement vocabulary of traditional dance to integrate or substitute that of other performing arts (theater, video, lectures, music, etc.), and even [[plastic arts]].

== History ==
Most of the choreographers who developed non-dance came from the milieu of ''[[nouvelle danse française]]'' (also known as ''jeune danse française'': "new" or "young" French dance) in which they participated as performers in the 1980s. They became choreographers in the 1990s, their work focusing increasingly on creating pieces where dance and dance movement disappear in favor of many other activities or theatrical techniques, including [[legitimate theater]], lectures, plastic arts, music, and often video, film, or projections.&lt;ref&gt;Rosita Boisseau, [http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2009/04/25/dans-beaucoup-de-spectacles-de-danse-on-ne-danse-plus_1185423_3246.html#ens_id=1185104 Dans beaucoup de spectacles de danse, on ne danse plus], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting performances are akin to [[performance art]]; in some cases, dancers as such are not even necessary to the execution of the work: the choreographer-author speaking through other media and sometimes in places not originally intended for dance performances, such as museums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-spectacles-vivants/02-06.html Danse ou non-danse: par où la danse?] on the official site of the [[Centre Pompidou]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The precursor to this movement is [[Orazio Massaro]]{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} (a dancer in the company of [[Dominique Bagouet]] from 1987 to 1990), who created the piece ''Volare'' for the [[Montpellier Dance Festival]] in 1990. In that piece, for the first time in the history of French contemporary dance, six dancers were deprived of choreography and become actors, in a critical look at dance through their autobiographical stories. 

Major choreographers associated with non-dance include [[Boris Charmatz]], [[Jérôme Bel]], [[Hervé Robbe]], [[Xavier Le Roy]], [[Alain Buffard]], [[Benoît Lachambre]], [[Josef Nadj]], [[Maguy Marin]] (in her recent pieces), [[Carlotta Sagna]], and [[Wayn Traub]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25019">In 2000 Paolo Brescia and Tommaso Principi established the collective OBR to investigate new ways of contemporary living, creating a design network among Milan, London and New York.

After working with Renzo Piano, Paolo and Tommaso have oriented the research of OBR towards the integration artifice-nature, to create sensitive architecture in perpetual change, stimulating the interaction between man and environment.

The team of OBR develops its design activity through public-private social programs, promoting – through architecture – the sense of community and the individual identities.

Today OBR is group open to different multidisciplinary contributors, cooperating with different universities, such as Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio, Aalto University, Academy of Architecture of Mumbai and Mimar Sinan Fine Art University.

Among the best known works by OBR are the Pythagoras Museum, the New Galleria Sabauda in Turin, the Milanofiori Residential Complex, the Children Hospital in Parma, the Galliera Hospital in Genoa, the Lido of Genoa, the Ex Cinema Roma, the Triennale di Milano Terrace.

The under construction projects by OBR include the Lehariya Cluster in Jaipur, the Jafza Traders Market in Dubai and the Multiuse Complex Ahmad Qasir in Teheran.

OBR's projects have been featured in Venice Biennale of Architecture, Royal Institute of British Architects in London, Bienal de Arquitetura of Brasilia, MAXXI in Rome and Triennale di Milano.

OBR has been awarded with the AR Award for Emerging Architecture at RIBA, the Plusform under 40, the Urbanpromo at the 11° Biennale di Venezia, the honourable mention for the Medaglia d'Oro all'Architettura Italiana, the Europe 40 Under 40 in Madrid, the Leaf Award overall winner in London, the WAN Residential Award, the Building Healthcare Award, the Inarch Award for Italian Architecture and the American Architecture Prize in New York.

Since 2004 OBR has been evolving its design parameters according to the environmental and energy certification [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design) and since 2009 OBR is partner of the [[Green Building Council|GBC]] (Green Building Council).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Building Council Italia|url=http://www.gbcitalia.org/soci/cerca?q=open+building+research&amp;aq=&amp;r=&amp;t=&amp;c=&amp;gb=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Opus vermiculatum''''' is a method of laying [[mosaic]] [[tesserae]] to emphasise an outline around a subject.  This can be of one or more rows and may also provide background contrast, eg as a shadow, sometimes with [[Opus tessellatum]].  The outline created is often light and offset by a dark background for greater contrast.  The name ''opus vermiculatum'' literally means "worm-like work", and has been described as one of the most demanding and elaborate forms of mosaic work.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Alan (2000). ''Floors''. frances lincoln ltd. {{ISBN|0-7112-1612-6}}. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually ''opus vermiculatum'' is meant to put emphasis on the main design and foreground details of a work, using a smooth and flowing halo-effect. Sometimes it was used only around the head of a figure. The tesserae used were often square but can be variously shaped.&lt;ref name=yal&gt;Strong, Donald (June 1, 1992). ''Roman Art: The Yale University Press Pelican History of Art''. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-05293-6}}. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

''Opus vermiculatum'' originated in [[Greece]], later than other mosaic methods.  The earliest known example is the Sophilos Mosaic of [[Thmuis]], which has been dated to around 200 BC.  The method spread throughout the Hellenistic world; for instance, [[Mosaics of Delos|the large corpus of surviving examples]] found on the island of [[Delos]].&lt;ref name=yal/&gt; In [[Egypt]] it was used for tomb decoration from the late-3rd to 1st Centuries BC, and in [[Syria]], it survived into later times.  The Nile Mosaic has a very refined use of color and shows an advanced development.  This may indicate that the technique was based on paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Meyboom, P G P (January 1, 1994). ''The Nile Mosaic of Palestrina: Early Evidence of Egyptian Religion in Italy''. Brill Academic Publishers. {{ISBN|90-04-10137-3}}. p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1st Century BC, it reached Italy along with other mosaic methods.  Many fine examples of this style have been found at [[Pompeii]].  One remarkable work in particular portrays a crucial scene in the [[Battle of Issus]], and was possibly copied from a 4th-century BC Greek painting or fresco.  The use of ''opus vermiculatum'' declined after the 1st century AD, but continued to be employed for finer Roman mosaics until the 4th century.  By then, mosaics were becoming increasingly impressionistic, taking advantage of the crystalline reflection of the tesserae, which was better suited to ''opus tessellatum''.  It was eventually entirely abandoned for this style.&lt;ref&gt;"opus vermiculatum." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orroroo'''  is a town in the [[Yorke and Mid North]] region of [[South Australia]].  At the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 census]], the locality of Orroroo had a population of 610 while its urban centre had a  population of 537.&lt;ref name= Census2016ssc/&gt; &lt;ref name= Census2016ucl/&gt;  The [[Wilmington-Ucolta Road]] passes through here, intersecting with the [[RM Williams Way]] which leads to the [[Birdsville Track|Birdsville]] and [[Oodnadatta Track]]s. The [[Peterborough–Quorn railway line]] extended from [[Peterborough railway station, South Australia|Peterborough]] to Orroroo also in 1881 and [[Quorn, South Australia|Quorn]] in 1882, connecting with the new [[Central Australia Railway]] from [[Port Augusta railway station|Port Augusta]]. These railways have now been abandoned. Orroroo is situated near [[Goyder's Line]], a line drawn up in 1865 by Surveyor General Goyder which he believed indicated the edge of the area suitable for agriculture.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, Orroroo was the home of the [[Ngadjuri]] [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] people whose domain was the area to the east of the Flinders Rangers. The name Orroroo  was thought to be an form of [[onomatopoeia]] in imitation of wind blowing through acacia trees. According to J. Gray, it actually meant 'early start', referring to the fact that the Ngadjuri, who usually camped at Pekina Creek, would move to camp at the Orroroo river the night before hunting for kangaroos, which would come up to the river at that point and thus allow them to make an early start at dawn for the hunt. &lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite journal | title = Notes on native tribe formerly resident at Orroroo, South Australia| last = Gray |first = J.|journal = The South Australian Naturalist| year = 1930 | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–6|url = https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/132605#page/7/mode/1up| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;Aboriginal origins, but the true meaning of the word is uncertain. The name was first used by an early pioneer who conducted a nearby coaching house which served travellers on the Burra-Blinman track.

In 1844, the first Europeans to settle, John and James Chambers, took up the [[Pekina, South Australia|Pekina]] Run which covered 320 square miles. They did not receive a millimetre of rain during the 17 months that they lived there. As a result of this [[drought]], they sold the Pekina Run for £30.

Charlie Easther settled in Orroroo during 1864 and opened up an eating house that became a popular stopping point for the [[Droving|drover]]s and [[bullocky]]s who travelled through the area. The town was surveyed in 1875, when Solly's Hut, a clay-pugged log structure, was constructed as the town's first house and is now used as a museum.  In September 1875, the town was officially named by [[George Goyder]] following  the suggestion made by Charlie Easther {{see below|Origin of the name "Orroroo"}}. The first land sales were made in May 1876. The town was granted its own local council, the [[District Council of Orroroo]], in 1887 (taking effect in 1888(, and the town's council offices were constructed in 1888.&lt;ref name="Australian Places"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reader's Digest Illustrated Guide to Australian Places|year=1993|publisher=Reader's Digest|location=Sydney, NSW|isbn=0-86438-399-1|pages=535}}&lt;/ref&gt; The District Council of Orroroo would survive until 1997, when it was merged to create the [[District Council of Orroroo Carrieton]].

On 24 August 1923, 230-volt electricity was connected to the town by Cr Martin Redden, Chairman of the District Council, in the presence of a large crowd. On 4 July 1962, the power house engines were shut down to change to AC power which gave the houses standard 240-volt power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.orroroo.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=295|publisher=District Council of Orroroo|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early irrigation scheme was formed after damming the Pekina Creek and creating the Pekina reservoir. Water from here was supplied to over 50 dairy farms. Orroroo had its own flour mill, several bakeries, carriage manufacturer and a butter factory, which still stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orroroo|url=http://www.orroroo.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=266|publisher=District Council of Orroroo|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orroroo is the service centre for a predominantly farming community with the main products being wheat, sheep, cattle, pigs and a kangaroo processor.

A local curiosity is nearby, called "Magnetic Hill", which is a [[gravity hill]] [[optical illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eureka4you.com/magnetichillworldwide/Peterborough-SA.htm Magnetic Hill - Peterborough - South Australia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Railways==
The town was connected by the [[Peterborough–Quorn railway line]] to [[Peterborough railway station, South Australia|Peterborough]] and [[Quorn railway station|Quorn]] in September 1881, and was served by a Class 1 station and a large Goods Shed. During 1962, concrete grain silos were built in the Yard. these provided the bulk of traffic until the railway was closed in 1987&lt;ref name=jev&gt;Evans, J 2009; ''Proceed to Quorn'' Railmac Publications {{Listed Invalid ISBN|978-1-86477-066-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orroroo was the last attended station on the railway; staff were withdrawn and the station operated as "unattended" from August 1981.

Passenger services were discontinued during 1969, when the [[South Australian Railways]] withdrew the railcar service.

Grain continued to be hauled by rail from Orroroo until 1987, when all rail services were withdrawn by [[Australian National Railways Commission|Australian National]].&lt;ref name=jev/&gt; [[Steamtown Peterborough Railway Preservation Society|Steamtown]], a railway preservation group based at Peterborough, operated passenger trains for tourists to Orroroo and [[Eurelia]] until 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kelly, B (as Editor) |date=2003 |title=Public Liability Halts Trains |journal=The PartyLine |issue=Number 78, Summer 2003 |publisher=[[Steamtown, Peterborough Railway Preservation Society]] |issn=1322-2473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The railway line was eventually removed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mannion, J |title=Ripping up the tracks - Eurelia to Peterborough |journal=Catchpoint Magazine |date=March 2009 |pages=14-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills S "''Harvest time for the Eurelia rail line''"     [http://flindersranges.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/harvest-time-for-eurelia-rail-line/1276346.aspx Flinders News - 19 September 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709151326/http://flindersranges.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/harvest-time-for-eurelia-rail-line/1276346.aspx |date=9 July 2012 }} 10 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Road transport==
Orroroo is on the south-north [[RM Williams Way]] (route B80) connecting [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] to [[Hawker, South Australia|Hawker]] and the west-east route B56 connecting the [[Port Augusta]] to [[Broken Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{google maps |url=https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Orroroo+SA+5431/@-32.7302311,138.6143556,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x6abdd630112a2505:0x4033654628ed920?hl=en |title=Orroroo |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the name "Orroroo"==
&lt;!-- This section heading is cross-referenced from § History --&gt;
"Orroroo" was officially named by a C.J. Easther, an early settler in the region. The ''Register'' of 16 November 1926 gives two still further alternatives, stating that Orroroo was the name of an Aboriginal girl who lived on nearby Pekina station, and that the town was for some reason named in honour of this girl, but also noting that others have suggested the name derivates from an Aboriginal word meaning 'dust', 'drift', or 'a windy locality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=Manning, G|date=1990 |title=Mannings Place Names of South Australia |ISBN=}} {{Listed Invalid ISBN|05437687505}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is true that in the ''Advertiser'' of 9 January 1903, it is said that ''orroroo'' means ''wind'' in "the native language".&lt;ref&gt;''Advertiser'', 9 January 1903&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Advertiser'' of 15 August 1908, a still further derivation is suggested by a Gustav Degenhardt, who claims the name comes from the Aboriginal name for a nearby creek, ''Oorooroo''.&lt;ref&gt;Advertiser, 15 August 1908&lt;/ref&gt; Degenhardt resided in Orroroo from at least as early as 1880 (five years after Easther named the town), so it may be that he had first-hand knowledge of Easther's reasons for so naming the town.&lt;ref&gt;South Australian Government Gazette, 12 February 1880&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Philosophers' Imprint''''' is a refereed [[philosophy]] journal.

The journal was launched by University of Michigan Philosophy professors [[Stephen Darwall]] (now at Yale University) and [[J. David Velleman]] (now at New York University). In 2000, Darwall and Velleman approached Michigan's librarians with the goal of starting a small revolution in academic philosophy publishing. They hoped that publishing philosophical research online could significantly reduce the amount of time between submission and publication from what was then typical in professional journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|issue=1
|doi=10.3998/3336451.0020.100
|ref=harv}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;
The university's librarians, incentivized by the rising costs of subscribing to academic journals, in turn drew on their expertise in managing digital content to collaborate with the editors to produce a journal from within the library, calling the resulting operation The Scholarly Publishing Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The editors of ''Philosophers' Imprint'' recognized that by publishing an academic journal online, they could also make research available to everyone with internet access, “including students and teachers in developing countries, as well as members of the general public.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally edited by Darwall and Vellemean, ''Philosophers' Imprint'' is now co-edited by a team of thirteen philosophers, advised by an international editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.philosophersimprint.org/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; The journal ranked in the top ten of all general philosophy journals in a unscientific poll of philosophers conducted in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''The Prophet Daniel''''' is one of the seven [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]'s painted by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] master [[Michelangelo]] (c. 1542–1545) on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]. The [[Sistine Chapel]] is in [[Vatican Palace]], in the [[Vatican City]].

This particular [[fresco]] figure is painted second on the right from the side of the [[High Altar]]. Unlike many other paintings of the period, this portrayal makes no reference to the most famous event from [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]'s life, that is his time [[Daniel in the lions' den|in the den of the lions]]. Instead, Michelangelo shows Daniel reading a great book, which is held up by a muscular figure from below.

'''Robert Wilson''' (born October 4, 1941) is an American [[experimental theater]] [[stage director]] and [[playwright]] who has been described by the media as "[America]'s – or even the world's – foremost avant-garde 'theater artist{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/magazine/staging-painterly-visions.html|title=Staging Painterly Visions|author=[[John Rockwell]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-11-15|page=23 (sect. 6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of his wide-ranging career, he has also worked as a [[choreographer]], [[performer]], [[Painting|painter]], [[sculptor]], [[video artist]], and [[sound]] and [[lighting designer]]. 

He is best known for his collaborations with [[Philip Glass]] on ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'', and with numerous other artists, including [[Heiner Müller]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Tom Waits]], [[David Byrne]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Gavin Bryars]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Darryl Pinckney]], [[Richard Gallo (performance artist)|Richard Gallo]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. In 1991 Wilson established [[The Watermill Center]], "a laboratory for performance" on the East End of [[Long Island]], New York. He has received more commissions for new works in Europe than in the United States since the late 20th century, regularly working with opera and theatre companies, as well as cultural festivals.

==Early life and education==
Wilson was born in [[Waco, Texas]], the son of Loree Velma (née Hamilton) and D.M. Wilson, a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/30/Robert-Wilson.html "Robert Wilson"], ''Film Reference''&lt;/ref&gt; After attending local schools, he studied business administration at the [[University of Texas]] from 1959 to 1962. 

He moved to [[Brooklyn]], New York in 1963 in order to change fields. He received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] in architecture from the [[Pratt Institute]] in 1966. During this period, he also attended lectures by [[Sibyl Moholy-Nagy]] (widow of [[László Moholy-Nagy]]), and studied painting with artist [[George McNeil (artist)|George McNeil]]. Later he went to Arizona to study architecture with [[Paolo Soleri]] at his desert complex.&lt;ref&gt;Rima Suqi (September 21, 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/garden/robert-wilson-on-his-passion-for-chairs.html "Robert Wilson, Director, on His Passion for Chairs"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

=== Theater ===
After moving to New York, Wilson found himself drawn to the work of pioneering choreographers [[George Balanchine]], [[Merce Cunningham]], and [[Martha Graham]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancenterfrance.org/front/index.php?&amp;lvlid=66&amp;dsgtypid=10&amp;a=1&amp;title=The%C3%A2tre&amp;lang=en Robert Wilson], American Center France.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he founded an experimental performance company, the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds (named for a teacher who helped him overcome a severe stutter while a teenager). With this company, he directed his first major works, beginning with 1969's ''The King of Spain'' and ''The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud''. He began to work in opera in the early 1970s, creating ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'' with composer [[Philip Glass]]. This work brought the two artists worldwide renown. Following ''Einstein'', Wilson worked increasingly with major European theaters and opera houses.&lt;ref name=paula/&gt; For the New York debut of his first opera, the [[Metropolitan Opera]] allowed Wilson to rent the house on a Sunday, when they did not have a production, but would not produce the work. The house sold out in two days.&lt;ref name=rachel&gt;Rachel Donadio (January 3, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/arts/international/history-time-and-space-in-opera.html "Paris Embraces ''Einstein'' Again"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Wilson's ''Deafman Glance'', a long, silent play, was premiered at the Nancy Festival in [[Nancy, France|France]]. It later opened in Paris, championed by the designer [[Pierre Cardin]].&lt;ref name="rachel"/&gt; The Surrealist poet [[Louis Aragon]] loved it and published a letter to the Surrealist poet [[André Breton]] (who had died in 1966),&lt;ref name="rachel"/&gt; in which he praised Wilson as: "What we, from whom Surrealism was born, dreamed would come after us and go beyond us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Design Museum |title=Robert Wilson: Theatre Director + Designer |url=http://designmuseum.org/design/robert-wilson | accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983/84, Wilson planned a performance for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], ''[[the CIVIL warS|the CIVIL warS: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down]]''; the complete work was to have been 12 hours long, in 6 parts. The production was only partially completed; the full event was cancelled by the Olympic Arts Festival, due to insufficient funds.&lt;ref name=Rockwell1990&gt;[[John Rockwell]] (June 20, 1990), [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/20/theater/critic-s-notebook-robert-wilson-wins-a-faithful-following-but-it-s-in-europe.html "Critic's Notebook; Robert Wilson Wins A Faithful Following, But It's in Europe"], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the [[Pulitzer Prize]] jury unanimously selected ''the CIVIL warS'' for the drama prize, but the supervisory board rejected the choice and gave no drama award that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= At Home With: Robert Wilson; The Clark Kent Of Modern Theater |author=Mel Gussow|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=Jan 6, 1994|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 alone, Wilson created four new productions in four different West German cities: Shakespeare's ''King Lear'' in Frankfurt, Chekhov's ''Swan Song'' in Munich, an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's ''Orlando'' in West Berlin, and ''The Black Rider,'' a collaboration by Wilson, [[Tom Waits]] and [[William S. Burroughs]], in Hamburg.&lt;ref name=Rockwell1990 /&gt;

Wilson is known for pushing the boundaries of theatre. His works are noted for their austere style, very slow movement, and often extreme scale in space or in time. ''The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin'' was a 12-hour performance, while ''KA MOUNTain and GUARDenia Terrace'' was staged on a mountaintop in [[Iran]] and lasted seven days.

In 2010 Wilson was working on a new stage musical with composer (and long-time collaborator) [[Tom Waits]] and the Irish playwright, [[Martin McDonagh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.antilabelblog.com/?p=2257 | title=New Musical From Tom Waits On The Horizon | publisher=Anti Records | date=2010-02-02 | accessdate=2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His theatrical production of ''Lecture on Nothing'', which was commissioned for a celebration of the [[John Cage]] centenary at the 2012 [[Ruhrtriennale]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruhrtriennale.de/en/programm/kuenstler/bob-wilson/ Robert Wilson] [[Ruhrtriennale]].&lt;/ref&gt; had its U.S. premiere in [[Royce Hall]], UCLA, by the Center for the Art of Performance.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Swed (October 16, 2013), [http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/16/entertainment/la-et-cm-john-cage-lecture-nothing-review-20131017 "Review: Robert Wilson finds the poetry in 'Lecture on Nothing{{'"}}], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Wilson, in collaboration with [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] and co-starring [[Willem Dafoe]], developed ''[[The Old Woman (play)|The Old Woman]]'', an adaptation of the work by the Russian author [[Daniil Kharms]]. The play premiered at MIF13, Manchester International Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mif.co.uk/event/the-old-woman|title=''The Old Woman'' Robert Wilson, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Willem Dafoe|date = 2013|accessdate = 2014-11-23|website = Manchester International Festival|publisher = Manchester International Festival|last = Jansch|first = Lucie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson wrote that he and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov|Baryshnikov]] had discussed creating a play together for years, perhaps based on a Russian text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://calperformances.org/learn/program_notes/2014/pn_oldwoman.pdf|title = Cal Performances University of California, Berkeley Playbill|date = 2014|accessdate = 2014-11-23|website = Calperformances|publisher = UC Berkeley|last = Wilson|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final production included dance, light, singing and bilingual monologue.

Since 1999, Wilson has premiered nine theatrical works in Berlin. By contrast, as of 2013, his last commission in the United States was 21 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Barkham (August 22, 2012), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/22/robert-wilson-walking-angels-norfolk "Robert Wilson takes a walk with angels in Norfolk"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He continues to direct revivals of his most celebrated productions, including ''The Black Rider'' in London, San Francisco, Sydney, Australia, and Los Angeles; ''The Temptation of St. Anthony'' in New York and Barcelona; ''Erwartung'' in Berlin; ''Madama Butterfly'' at the [[Bolshoi Opera]] in Moscow; and Wagner's ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' at [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=paula&gt;[http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/493 "Robert Wilson, Deafman Glance": Video Installation, September 24 – November 13, 2010] [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; He also directs all Monteverdi operas for the opera houses of [[La Scala]] in Milan and the [[Palais Garnier]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mif.co.uk/artist/robert-wilson MIF13: Robert Wilson] Manchester International Festival.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual art and design ===
In addition to his work for the stage, Wilson creates sculpture, drawings, and furniture designs. He won the Golden Lion at the 1993 [[Venice Biennale]] for a sculptural installation. Exhibited in December 1976 at the [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], Wilson's storyboards were described by one critic as "serial art, equivalent to the slow-motion tempo of [Wilson's] theatrical style. In drawing after drawing after drawing, a detail is proposed, analyzed, refined, redefined, moved through various positions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/525 Einstein on the Beach: Robert Wilson, Philip Glass, Lucinda Childs, Christopher Knowles, Andrew de Groat, September 12 – October 20, 2012] [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Ali Hossaini]] offered Wilson a residency at the television channel [[LAB HD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ali Hossaini |title=Merging Art and Television |url=http://www.highdef.com/magazine/archive/HighDef_2007_2MarApr.pdf |format=PDF|page= 25 |accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Wilson, with producer Esther Gordon (and among others [[Brad Pitt]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Juliette Binoche]], [[Isabelle Huppert]], [[Dita von Teese]], and [[Peter Sarsgaard]]) and later with Matthew Shattuck, has produced dozens of high-definition videos known as the [[Voom Portraits]]. Collaborators on this well-received project included the composer [[Michael Galasso]], the late artist and designer Eugene Tsai, fashion designer Kevin Santos, and lighting designer Urs Schönebaum. In addition to celebrity subjects, sitters have included royalty, animals, Nobel Prize winners and hobos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2006/12/wilson200612|title= The Subject as Star|author=Bob Colacello |journal= Vanity Fair |publisher=Condé Nast |page= 318 |date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American pop singer [[Lady Gaga]] announced in 2013 that she would collaborate with Wilson as part of her ARTPOP project. He subsequently designed the set for her 2013 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] performance.&lt;ref name=gaga&gt;Amy Serafin (December 12, 2013), [http://www.wallpaper.com/art/robert-wilsons-macabre-video-portraits-of-lady-gaga/7011#XhR3uydTERiTAj84.99 "Robert Wilson's macabre video portraits of Lady Gaga"] (12 Dec 2013) ''[[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson also suggested that Gaga pose for his Voom Portraits.&lt;ref name=gaga/&gt; Knowing he had an upcoming residency as guest curator at the [[Louvre]], Wilson chose themes from the museum's collection, all dealing with death. They shot the videos in a London studio over three days, Gaga standing for 14 or 15 hours at a time.&lt;ref name=gaga/&gt; Called "Living Rooms," the resulting exhibition included two video works: one inspired by [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[The Death of Marat]]'', hung in the painting galleries, and another in which Lady Gaga brings to life a painting by [[Ingres]].&lt;ref name=rachel/&gt; In the Louvre's auditorium, Wilson hosted and took part in a series of performances, conversations, film screenings, and discussions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/en/louvre-invites-robert-wilson-living-rooms The Louvre invites Robert Wilson – Living Rooms, November 11, 2013 – February 17, 2014] [[Louvre]], Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; The centerpiece of the residency is a room filled with objects from the artist's personal collection in New York, including African masks, a Shaker chair, ancient Chinese ceramics, shoes worn by [[Marlene Dietrich]] and a photo of Wilson and Glass taken in the early 1980s by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]].&lt;ref name=rachel/&gt;

In 2011, Wilson designed an art park dedicated to the Finnish designer [[Tapio Wirkkala]] (1915–1985), situated in the [[Arabianranta]] district of Helsinki. His plans for the rectangular park feature a central square divided into nine equally sized fields separated by bushes. Each field will be installed with objects related to the home. For example, one unit will consist of a small fireplace surrounded by stones that serve as seating. The park will be lit by large, lightbox-style lamps build into the ground and by smaller ones modelled on ordinary floor lamps.&lt;ref&gt;Clemens Bomsdorf (June 28, 2011), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Helsinki-to-get-new-art-park/24045 Helsinki to get new art park] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language is one of the most important elements of theatre and Robert Wilson feels at home with commanding it in many different ways. Wilson's impact on this part of theatre alone is immense. [[Arthur Holmberg]], Professor of Theatre at [[Brandeis University]], says that "In theatre, no one has dramatized the crisis of language with as much ferocious genius as Robert Wilson".&lt;ref name=ho&gt;Holmberg, Arthur (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAjTK98rIwkC ''The Theatre Of Robert Wilson''], Cambridge: Cambridge UP {{ISBN|978-0-52136-492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}} Wilson makes it evident in his work that what's and why's of language are terribly important and cannot be overlooked. [[Tom Waits]], acclaimed songwriter and collaborator with Wilson, said this about Wilson's unique relationship with words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Words for Bob are like tacks on the kitchen floor in the dark of night and you're barefoot. So Bob clears a path he can walk through words without getting hurt. Bob changes the values and shapes of words. In some sense they take on more meaning; in some cases, less.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|43}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wilson shows the importance of language through all of his works and in many varying fashions. He credits his reading of the work of [[Gertrude Stein]] and listening to recordings of her speaking with "changing [his] way of thinking forever."&lt;ref&gt;"Director's Notes" in a program for Stein's ''Four Saints in Three Acts'', quoted in Sarah Bay-Cheng (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=FFSTAgAAQBAJ ''Mama Dada: Gertrude Stein's Avant-Garde Theater''], p. 135, New York: Routledge {{ISBN|978-0-20350-302-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson directed three of Stein's works in the 1990s: ''[[Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights]]'' (1992), ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'' (1996), and ''Saints and Singing'' (1998).

Wilson considers language and, down to its very ingredients, words, as a sort of "a social artifact".&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|44}} Not only does language change with time but it changes with person, with culture. Using his experience of working with mentally handicapped children and enlisting the collaboration of [[Christopher Knowles]], a renowned autistic poet, has allowed Wilson attack language from many views. Wilson embraces this by often "juxtaposing levels of diction – Miltonic opulence and contemporary ling, crib poetry and pre-verbal screams" in an attempt to show his audience how elusive language really is and how ever-changing it can be.&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|44}} Visually showing words is another method Wilson uses to show the beauty of language. Often his set designs, program covers, and posters are graffiti'd with words. This allows the audience to look at the "language itself" rather than "the objects and meanings it refers to.".&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|45}}

The lack of language becomes essential to Wilson's work as well. In the same way an artist uses positive and negative space, Wilson uses noise and silence. In working on a production of ''[[King Lear]]'', Wilson inadvertently describes his necessity of silence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The way actors are trained here is wrong. All they think about is interpreting a text. They worry about how to speak words and know nothing about their bodies. You see that by the way they walk. They don't understand the weight of a gesture in space. A good actor can command an audience by moving one finger.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|49}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This emphasis on silence is fully explored in some of his works. ''[[Deafman Glance]]'' is a play without words, and his adaptation of [[Heiner Müller]]'s play ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Quartett (play)|de|3=Quartett (Heiner Müller)|lt=Quartet}}'' contained a fifteen-minute wordless prologue. Holmberg describes these works stating, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Language does many things and does them well. But we tend to shut our eyes to what language does not do well. Despite the arrogance of words – they rule traditional theatre with an iron fist – not all experience can be translated into a linguistic code.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|50}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Celebrated twentieth century playwright [[Eugène Ionesco]] said that Wilson "surpassed [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]" because "[Wilson's] silence is a silence that speaks".&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|52}} This silence onstage may be unnerving to audience members but serves a purpose of showing how important language is by its absence. It is Wilson's means of answering his own question: "Why is it no one looks? Why is it no one knows how to look? Why does no one see anything on stage?".&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|52}}

Another technique Wilson uses is that of what words can mean to a particular character. His piece, ''I was sitting on my patio this guy appeared I thought I was hallucinating'', features only two characters, both of whom deliver the same stream-of-consciousness monologue. In the play's first production one character was "aloof, cold, [and] precise" while the other "brought screwball comedy… warmth and color… playful[ness]".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|61}} The different emphases and deliveries brought to the monologue two different meanings; "audiences found it hard to believe they heard the same monologue twice".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|61}} Rather than tell his audience what words are supposed to mean, he opens them up for interpretation, presenting the idea that "meanings are not tethered to words like horses to hitching posts".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|61}}

===Movement===
Movement is another key element in Wilson's work. As a dancer, he sees the importance of the way an actor moves onstage and knows the weight their movement bears. When speaking of his "play without words" rendition of [[Ibsen]]'s ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'', Wilson says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do movement before we work on the text. Later we'll put text and movement together. I do movement first to make sure it's strong enough to stand on its own two feet without words. The movement must have a rhythm and structure of its own. It must not follow the text. It can reinforce a text without illustrating it. What you hear and what you see are two different layers. When you put them together, you create another texture.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|136}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With such an emphasis on movement, Wilson even tailors his auditions around the necessity of it. In his auditions, "Wilson often does an elaborate movement sequence" and "asks the actor to repeat it".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|136}} [[Thomas Derrah]], an actor in ''[[the CIVIL warS]]'', found the audition process to be baffling: "When I went in, [Wilson] asked me to walk across the room on a count of 31, sit down on a count of 7, put my hand to my forehead on a count of 59. I was mystified by the whole process".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|137}} To further cement the importance of movement in Wilson's works, [[Seth Goldstein]], another actor in ''the CIVIL warS'', stated "every movement from the moment I walked onto the platform until I left was choreographed to the second. During the scene at table all I did was count movements. All I thought about was timing".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|137}}

When it comes time to add the text in with movement, there is still much work to be done. Wilson pays close attention to the text and still makes sure there is enough "space around a text" in order for the audience to soak it up.&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|139}} At this point, the actors know their movements and the time in which they are executed, allowing Wilson to tack the actions onto specific pieces of text. His overall goal is to have the rhythm of the text differ from that of the movement so his audience can see them as two completely different pieces, seeing each as what it is. When in the text/movement stage, Wilson often interrupts the rehearsal, saying things like "Something is wrong. We have to check your scripts to see if you put the numbers in the right place".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|139}} He goes on to explain the importance of this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know it's hell to separate text and movement and maintain two different rhythms. It takes time to train yourself to keep tongue and body working against each other. But things happen with the body that have nothing to do with what we say. It's more interesting if the mind and the body are in two different places, occupying different zones of reality.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|139}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These rhythms keep the mind on its toes, consciously and subconsciously taking in the meanings behind the movement and how it is matching up with the language.

Similar to Wilson's use of the lack of language in his works, he also sees the importance that a lack of movement can have. In his production of ''[[Medea]]'', Wilson arranged a scene in which the lead singer stood still during her entire song while many others moved around her. Wilson recalls that "she complained that if I didn't give her any movements, no one would notice her. I told her if she knew how to stand, everyone would watch her. I told her to stand like a marble statue of a goddess who had been standing in the same spot for a thousand years".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|147}} Allowing an actor to have such stage presence without ever saying a word is very provocative, which is precisely what Wilson means to accomplish with any sense of movement he puts on the stage.

===Lighting===
Wilson believes that, "The most important part of theatre" is light.&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|121}} He is concerned with how images are defined onstage, and this is related to the light of an object or tableau. He feels that the lighting design can really bring the production to life. The set designer for Wilson's ''[[The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down|the CIVIL warS]]'', [[Tom Kamm]], describes his philosophy: "a set for Wilson is a canvas for the light to hit like paint".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|121}} He explains, "If you know how to light, you can make shit look like gold. I paint, I build, I compose with light. Light is a magic wand".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|121}}

Wilson is "the only major director to get billing as a lighting designer" and is recognized by some as "the greatest light artist of our time".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|122}} He designs with light to be flowing rather than an off-and-on pattern, thus making his lighting "like a musical score".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|123}} Wilson's lighting designs feature "dense, palpable textures" and allow "people and objects to leap out from the background".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|123}} In his design for ''Quartett'', Wilson used four hundred light cues in a span of only ninety minutes.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|122}}

He is a perfectionist, persisting to achieve every aspect of his vision. A fifteen-minute monologue in ''Quartett'' took two days for him to light while a single hand gesture took nearly three hours.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|126}} This attention to detail expresses his conviction that, "light is the most important actor on stage".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|128}}

===Props===
Wilson's interest in design extends to the props in his productions, which he designs and sometimes participates in constructing. Whether it is furniture, a light bulb, or a giant crocodile, Wilson treats each as a work of art in its own right. He demands that a full-scale model of each prop be constructed before the final one is made, in order "to check proportion, balance, and visual relationships" on stage.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|128}} Once he has approved the model, the crew builds the prop, and Wilson is "renowned for sending them back again and again and again until they satisfy him".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|128}} He is so strict in his attention to detail that when [[Jeff Muscovin]], his tech director for ''Quartett'', suggested they use an aluminum chair with a wood skin rather than a completely wooden chair, Wilson replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, Jeff, I want wood chairs. If we make them out of aluminum, they won't sound right when they fall over and hit the floor. They'll sound like metal, not wood. It will sound false. Just make sure you get strong wood. And no knots.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|129}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such attention to detail and perfectionism usually resulted in an expensive collection of props. "Curators regard them as sculptures",&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|129}} and the props have been sold for prices ranging from "$4,500 to $80,000".&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Mel (1998) ''Theatre On The Edge'', New York: Applause {{ISBN|978-1-55783-311-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113}}

==The Watermill Center==
In 1991 Wilson established [[The Watermill Center]] on the site of a former Western Union laboratory on the East End of Long Island, New York. Originally styled as "a laboratory for performance", The Watermill Center now operates year-round artist residencies, public education programs, exhibitions, and performances. The Center is situated within a 10-acre campus of gardens and designed landscape, and contains numerous works of art collected by Wilson.

==Summary==
The entire Rothko matter involved few litigants, but many counsel, some of them with lengthy professional services over a period from 1971 to 1979. Proceedings included removal of the estate's original executors, setting aside the contracts those executors made with the Marlborough gallery, eliminating the rights of the gallery with respect to its [[inter vivos]] contracts with the artist, restoring hundreds of paintings to the artist's estate, removal proceedings to compensate the estate for paintings not returnable to it to the extent of millions of dollars, election proceedings litigating the rights of election by the children against an excessive charitable distribution, contents proceedings construing Mark Rothko's will as to the meaning of the "contents" of the family residence willed to his widow and to her estate and later by the widow's will to Rothko's children, and valuation proceedings for valuing the art, assessed costs, fees, and taxes.&lt;ref name="Rothko1979"&gt;Estate of Rothko, 414 N.Y.S.2d 444, 98 Misc.2d 718 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
On September 16, 1968, Rothko executed a two-page will, drafted by and its execution supervised by his friend Bernard Reis, an unlicensed law-school graduate and [[Certified Public Accountant]], leaving all of his residual estate to the non-profit [[Rothko Foundation]] which Rothko organized shortly before his death.&lt;ref name="WillOfRothko"&gt;In re Will of Rothko, 351 N.Y.S.2d 940, 43 A.D.2d 819 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LastWord"&gt;Harrow, Gustave, The Final Word in the ROTHKO Case: Salient Legal Holdings of the Court of Appeals, ''Art &amp;amp; Law'', 4(2), p. 33 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

Five months later on February 21, 1969, Rothko entered into an agreement with Marlborough A.G., a [[Liechtenstein]] corporation with international galleries, which provided in part that he agreed "not to sell any works of art for a period of eight years, except to Marlborough A.G. if a supplementary contract is made."&lt;ref name="WillOfRothko"/&gt;

One year later Rothko died by suicide on February 25, 1970, leaving an estate consisting primarily but not entirely of 798 of his paintings. Rothko's wife Mary Alice died of a stroke six months after her husband's demise.&lt;ref name="AngryDaughter" /&gt; Rothko's will was admitted to probate the month following his death, naming his estate executors: Bernard Reis, who had drafted Rothko's will and who became a Marlborough Gallery New York director the month before Rothko died; [[Theodoros Stamos]], a friend and fellow artist represented by Marlborough New York starting in 1971; and Morton Levine, an anthropology professor, unconnected with Marlborough but who had been Rothko's son Christopher's guardian for a short time.&lt;ref name="LastWord" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AngryDaughter" /&gt;

Shortly before his death in 1970, Rothko made gifts to his children of certain key paintings in his possession in an effort to provide his children with financial security, since he believed that key patrons would pay higher prices for the works following his death. However, after Rothko died, his children were notified by the Marlborough's founder, Frances Kenneth Lloyd, that under the terms of the agreement made with the gallery in 1966 and renewed in 1969, the gallery owned all of Rothko's paintings.

[[File:Rothko BlueRedGreenNo2-1953.png|thumb|Mark Rothko, ''No. 2, Blue Red &amp;amp; Green'', 1953, oil on canvas. A section of a painting from Rothko's estate; the painting was among those wrongfully sold by the estate executors to Marlborough A.G. in 1970 very shortly after Rothko's death.]]

Following Rothko's death the three executors for the estate agreed to sell 100 works to Marlborough for a total of $1,800,000 while a further 698 works were consigned to the gallery for sale at a fixed commission of 50%, however, the executors paid only $200,000 upfront to the estate. In the year after Rothko's death, the value of his work more than doubled while early works were selling at auction for over $80,000.

In 1971 Kate Rothko sued to release the estate from the sale agreement and have the paintings returned to the family. The legal proceedings revealed that when still a struggling artist with a young family, Rothko agreed to a deal with the gallery in which all of his paintings would be sold through the gallery in exchange for a set monthly fee. Such terms were not unheard of, as [[Pablo Picasso]] had had a similar deal with his gallery in the 1920s.

It emerged from the proceedings that the estate executors and the gallery defrauded Rothko and his estate through various methods of self-dealing. Among other wrongful acts, the gallery had been filtering payments for Rothko's works through accounts in [[Switzerland]] and Liechtenstein as part of an effort to ensure the paintings were undervalued during Rothko's lifetime — in the 1960s this led the artist to vastly underestimate the value of his works, directly resulting in his agreement to consignments of dozens of paintings to the gallery and collectors without appreciating his works' full value.

The trial record revealed that the gallery had been stockpiling the undervalued works instead of selling them in order to ensure both a low market saturation and a high Marlborough inventory, anticipating a heightened value in the market after Rothko's death. Further, the 100 paintings 'sold' after Rothko's death by the estate executors through Marlborough were not sold to bona fide purchasers, but were instead retained by the gallery which shuffled the sale monies through its accounts in Europe, and which then quickly 're-sold' the works to actual purchasers for 5 to 6 times the value declared by the estate. Many works were sold this way by the Marlborough with the complicity of the executors despite the court's injunction against selling any works while the case was unresolved and still before the courts.

Ultimately, certain directors at Marlborough were convicted of defrauding the Rothko family, and in 1975, the court ordered the gallery to pay over $9 million in damages and costs, and also ordered the gallery to return 658 Rothko paintings it still held. Marlborough disputed the return of the paintings and was able to prevail as to those works it had sold during the proceedings in defiance of the court's orders to the contrary. Those works remained in the hands of collectors, including Rothko's 1953 oil on canvas painting, ''Homage to Matisse'', which later sold at public auction for US $22.4 million.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;Cooke, Rachel, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/14/art1 The art cheats who betrayed my father], ''[[The Observer]]'', guardian.co.uk, September 14, 2008. Accessed Jan. 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuation issues==
The courts involved in litigating the Rothko matter were faced with many complex issues as part of and beyond the wrongdoing of the Marlborough group as estate executors. In particular, the valuation of services rendered by counsel were litigated at length; and the valuation of the paintings posed complex questions as their valuation affected nearly every other matter facing the court.  In 1979 after much of the matter's litigation had already taken place, the court said:&lt;blockquote&gt;... &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;T&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;he bulk of the estate was and is in the form of hundreds of paintings rather than cash ... and ... &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;the&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Internal Revenue Service]] may not at an early time complete its final determination with respect to date-of-death [[Inheritance tax|estate taxes]]. The estate is presently resisting a deficiency assessment of large proportions. In litigating that issue there is not only a difference of opinion with respect to the value of the hundreds of paintings in this estate but also whether a [[blockage discount]] should be given to the estate and whether a further discount should be available due to the inter vivos contract for an exclusive agency in favor of Marlborough Galleries for seven years after death, and finally whether a discount should be enjoyed by the estate for commissions which must be paid for selling many of the paintings by agents of the estate.
...
&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;P&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;revailing counsel have participated in approximately 20,000 pages of transcript of pretrial and trial testimony; thousands of exhibits have been introduced and considered; thousands of pages of briefs have been submitted to this court and to the appellate courts; many decisions were made in this court, pretrial as well as the ultimate disposition; the Appellate Division has ruled on these matters several times; and the Court of Appeals has finally unanimously affirmed the major disposition made in this court, (43 N.Y.2d 305, 401 N.Y.S.2d 449, 372 N.E.2d 291).&lt;ref name="Rothko1979" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Former estate executors==
The Internal Revenue Service audited the Rothko Foundation and determined that Mark Rothko's former friend and ex-estate executor Bernard Reis was liable for various self-dealing excise taxes under section 4941 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] of 1954 (IRS code) for the years 1970 through 1974 in the total amount of $18,582,500, and additions to tax under sections 6651 and 6684 for the same years in the respective total amounts of $518,125 and $2,112,500. Reis' estate (he was dead by that time) lost its summary judgment motion to make the ruling go away.&lt;ref name="ReisAppeal"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Rothko+Case&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,48&amp;case=14896345529309871573&amp;scilh=0 Estate of Reis v. Commissioner], 87 TC 1016, Tax Court 1986, 3095-77. Accessed Jan. 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Theodoros Stamos protestations that he had done nothing wrong,&lt;ref name="AngryDaughter" /&gt; the Tax Court also ruled against him for liability for various self-dealing excise taxes under IRS code section 4941 for the years 1970 through 1976 in the total amount of $19,407,500, and additions to tax under sections 6651(a)(1) and 6684 for the same years in the respective total amounts of $724,375 and $2,957,500. Stamos also lost his appeal.&lt;ref name="StamousTax"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Rothko+Case&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,48&amp;case=10134621332923988669&amp;scilh=0 Stamos v. Commissioner], 87 TC 1451 - Tax Court 1986, 3096-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marlborough A.G.'s founder Frank Lloyd paid a third of the $9.2 million award to the Rothko children as a fine against Marlborough for violating the court's injunction against the sale of any further paintings before a final ruling or settlement.&lt;ref name="AngryDaughter" /&gt; The disgraced Lloyd is not mentioned as active after 1972 on the gallery history page on Marlborough's website.&lt;ref name="MAGsite"&gt;[http://www.marlboroughfineart.com/gallery.php History], Marlborough Fine Art.

[[File:Winslow Homer - The Cotton Pickers - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Cotton Pickers'', 1864 by [[Winslow Homer]]]]
'''''The Cotton Pickers''''', 1876 is an oil painting by [[Winslow Homer]] of two young [[African-American]] women in a cotton field.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Stately, silent and with barely a flicker of sadness on their faces, the two black women in the painting are unmistakable in their disillusionment: they picked cotton before the war and they are still picking cotton afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

It is oil on canvas, 24 1/16 x 38 1/8 in. (61.12 x 96.84 cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
