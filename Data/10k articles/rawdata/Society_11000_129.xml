A '''bikini [[barista]]''' is a person who prepares and serves [[coffee]] drinks while dressed in scanty attire such as a [[bikini]] or [[lingerie]].

== Controversies and litigation==

The phenomenon of bikini baristas has sometimes caused controversy and complaints from local residents.&lt;ref name="knotty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knotty2"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.woai.com/news/local/story/Bikini-clad-baristas-serve-up-more-than-a-cupful/q3vbxFORrE6Z7ajit8-lsw.cspx | title= Bikini-clad baristas serve up more than a cupful, it's an eyeful | author=  | work= [[KING-TV]] | date= November 24, 2009 | accessdate= March 9, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100203141533/http://www.woai.com/news/local/story/Bikini-clad-baristas-serve-up-more-than-a-cupful/q3vbxFORrE6Z7ajit8-lsw.cspx | archivedate= 2010-02-03 | deadurl= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsvid"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=5764397n | title= Steamed Over Bikini Baristas (Video) | author= | work=[[CBS News]] | date= November 24, 2009 | accessdate=March 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100317130219/http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=5764397n| archivedate= 17 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="angels"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.komonews.com/news/19159479.html | title= Local baristas say bikini, topless trend spilling over | author= | work=[[KOMO-TV]] | date= May 21, 2008 | accessdate=March 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420052236/http://www.komonews.com/news/19159479.html| archivedate= 20 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these complaints and incidents, some local jurisdictions have considered adopting local ordinances to regulate and control the activities of the stores.&lt;ref name="coverup"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://heraldnet.com/article/20080527/NEWS01/383827930 | title= 'Bikini baristas': Cities explore options for coverup | author= David Chircop | work=[[The Herald (Everett)]] | date= May 27, 2008 | accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snocoreg"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010463267_apwabikinibaristas.html | title= SnoCo rules bikini baristas are adult businesses | agency= Associated Press | work=[[The Seattle Times]] | date= December 9, 2009 | accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evreg"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.kboi2.com/news/local/63274262.html | title= Washington town sets limits on bikini baristas' behavior | author= Ray Lane | work= [[KBOI-TV]] | date= October 2, 2009 | accessdate= March 9, 2010 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718232027/http://www.kboi2.com/news/local/63274262.html | archivedate= July 18, 2011 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Snohomish County ===
Undercover police officers in [[Snohomish County, Washington]], witnessed some baristas performing additional services for extra money, including letting customers touch them, photograph them or watch them lick whipped cream off each other.  These statements have been retracted by the Everett WA police department, as the police officer 'undercover' was a known customer and offered money to the barista.&lt;ref name="Did sergeant in 'bikini barista' sting help drive-through coffee shops operate as strip clubs?"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/sergeant_accused_of_helping_bikini_barristas_operate_drive-through_coffee/ | title=Did sergeant in 'bikini barista' sting help drive-through coffee shops operate as strip clubs? | publisher=American Bar Association | date=27 June 2013 | accessdate=31 January 2014 | author=Neil, Martha}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Everett, WA police department was accused of [[entrapment]].&lt;ref name="cbs1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20090923/NEWS01/909239969/0/FRONTPAGE|title=Five risque Everett Grab-N-Go baristas charged with prostitution|work=The Daily Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2009, five baristas at a Grab 'n Go in Everett, Washington were charged with [[prostitution]] after police surveillance caught them stripping and performing sexual acts for cash.&lt;ref name="cbsphotos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/01/08/your-tax-dollars-hard-at-nsfw|title=Your Tax Dollars Hard at NSFW|work=The Stranger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other complaints were in regard to the stand's proximity to preschools and daycare centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20090207/NEWS01/702079900|title=Racy espresso stand upsets preschool's parents|work=The Daily Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 the owner and three employees of Java Juggs in [[Edmonds, Washington]], were charged with [[prostitution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://komonews.com/news/local/java-juggs-baristas-owner-busted-for-prostitution-after-probe-11-21-2015 |title=Java Juggs baristas, owner busted for prostitution after probe |publisher=KOMO News |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the police later releasing some footage obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://komonews.com/news/local/undercover-cop-video-shows-barista-stripping-at-coffee-stand-11-21-2015 |title=Undercover cop video shows barista stripping at coffee stand  |publisher=KOMO News |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Everett, Washington|Everett]] (the county seat of and the largest city in Snohomish County), in December 2017 was temporarily enjoined against enforcing a dress code ordinance against bikini baristas by U.S. District Court Judge Marsha Pechman who found it [[unconstitutionally vague]], violated their [[freedom of expression]] and unconstitutional under the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] since it targeted only women. In 2018 March the city filed an appeal with [[9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] and requested the injunction be lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-files-federal-court-appeal-over-bikini-barista-case/ |title=Rule clear about bikini baristas' exposure, Everett argues |publisher=HearldNet |date= |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/03/bikini-baristas-hit-with-court-brief-demanding-cover-up.html/ |title=Bikini baristas hit with court brief demanding they cover up |publisher=FOXNews |date= |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Belfair, Washington ===
In another incident, "Espresso Gone Wild" in [[Belfair, Washington]] was temporarily shut down by [[Mason County, Washington|Mason County]] in August 2008. It drew the ire of Belfair residents.  Mason County officials responded to complaints on the July 30, 2008 meeting by ruling the espresso stand is "erotic entertainment" and off limits in the Belfair area.  The owners of "Espresso Gone Wild" in Belfair were being told that their baristas are violating an erotic entertainment ordinance. They were also told that their baristas need to cover up and clean up their act or the stand will be shut down permanently. Mason County Commissioner [[Tim Sheldon]] says the owners of "Espresso Gone Wild" are welcome to open a coffee shop and compete with all the other coffee shops in town.

*Laura Maggi, a woman in her mid 30s, became a national celebrity in Italy in 2012 as a result of starting a habit of coming to work in revealing attire at the coffee bar called Le Cafe that she owns and operates in the small Italian town of Bagnolo Mella. She continues to generate local controversy serving "sexpresso" as she wears a variety of revealing outfits when serving customers. She also has female assistants who do the same, and sells glamour calendars of herself in addition to the coffee.

The '''Brahui''' ([[Brahui language|Brahui]]: براہوئی,) or '''Brahvi''' people are an ethnic group of about 2.2 million people with the vast majority found in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/lWCoIZ2K5dPycrhS1gk6nJ/A-slice-of-south-India-in-Balochistan.html|title=A slice of south India in Balochistan|last=Venkatesh|first=Karthik|date=2017-02-18|work=livemint.com/|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a small minority group in [[Afghanistan]], where they are native, but they are also found through their diaspora in [[Middle East]]ern states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&amp;pg=PT73|title=Brahuis|work=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia|author=James B. Minahan|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They mainly occupy the area in Balochistan from [[Bolan Pass]] through the Bolan Hills to Ras Muari ([[Cape Monze]]) on the Arabian sea, separating the [[Baloch people]] of [[Balochistan]] to the west and the [[Sindhi people]] of [[Sindh]] in the east. The Brahuis are almost entirely [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name="Andrew Dalby - Hindu origin of Brahui people"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CnckpL8auSIC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=brahui+hindu#v=onepage&amp;q=brahui%20hindu&amp;f=false| title = Dictionary of Languages: The Definitive Reference to More Than 400 Languages|publisher = Columbia University Press|accessdate = 2010-09-09|isbn = 9780231115698|date = 2004-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a varied pattern of language use among the Brahui: some of the constituent groups predominantly speak the Dravidian [[Brahui language]], others are bilingual in [[Balochi language|Balochi]] and Brahui, while others are speakers only of Balochi.

==Origins==
&lt;!--The ethnonym "Brahui" is a very old term and a purely Dravidian one.&lt;ref name="Mikhail Sergeevich Andronov - Dravidian Brahui language"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=K4lkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=brahui+dravidian&amp;dq=brahui+dravidian| title = Brahui, a Dravidian language: a descriptive and comparative study|publisher = Foreign Language Study|accessdate = 2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
The fact that other Dravidian languages only exist further south in India has led to several speculations about the origins of the Brahui.  There are three hypotheses regarding the Brahui that have been proposed by academics. 

One theory is that the Brahui are a [[relict population]] of Dravidians, surrounded by speakers of [[Indo-Iranian languages]], remaining from a time when Dravidian was more widespread. 

A second theory is that they migrated to [[Baluchistan]] from [[Mainland India|inner India]] during the early Muslim period of the 13th or 14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[Sergent, ''Genèse de l'Inde'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

The third theory says the Brahui migrated to Balochistan from [[Central India]] after 1000 AD. 

The absence of any older Iranian (Avestan) influence in Brahui supports this last hypothesis. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary is a northwestern Iranian language,  [[Balochi language|Baluchi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and southeastern [[Iranian language]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elfenbein | first1 = J.

Pagani, et al., conclude that this shows that the Brahui, although speaking a Dravidian language, had their Dravidian genetic component completely replaced by Indo-Iranian speakers, suggesting that the Brahui are descendents of a previous relict population whose genomes were replaced when more recent Indo-Iranian speakers arrived in South Asia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pagani|first=Luca|last2=Colonna|first2=Vincenza|last3=Tyler-Smith|first3=Chris|last4=Ayub|first4=Qasim|date=2017|title=An Ethnolinguistic and Genetic Perspective on the Origins of the Dravidian-Speaking Brahui in Pakistan|journal=Man in India|volume=97|issue=1|pages=267–278|issn=0025-1569|pmc=5378296|pmid=28381901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic findings and oral histories of the Brahui however say otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Pagani (2017) states in its "Conclusion" that there is "No historical or linguistic data support" the possibility that "the Brahui ancestors were Indo-European speakers, who later adopted a Dravidian language."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elfenbein | first1 = Josef | year = 1987 | title = A periplus of the 'Brahui problem' | url = | journal = Studia Iranica | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 215–233 | doi = 10.2143/SI.16.2.2014604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PP. 27, 142, Krishnamurti, Bhadriraju (2003), The Dravidian Languages, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-77111-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. 12 Origin and Spread of the Tamils By V.

==Tribes==
There are three groups of Brahui tribes. The "nucleus" consists of the Achmadzai, Gurguari, Iltazai, Kalandari, [[Kambrani]], Mirwari, Rodeni and the Sumalari, which altogether account for only a small proportion of the total number of Brahuis. The majority of the population is divided up between the Jhalawan Brahuis (which include the tribes of the Bizanjars, Harunis, [[Muhammad Hasni]]s, [[Mengal]]s, Siapad, Nicharis, Pandranis, Sajdis and the Zahris), and the Sarawan Brahuis (comprising the tribes of the [[Muhammad Shahi]], [[Bangulzai tribe|Bangulzai]], [[Kūrd]], [[Lehri tribe|Lahri]], [[Langov]], [[Raisani]], Rustamzai, Sarparah, Satakzai, Shahwani and Zagar-Mengal).{{sfn|Scholz|2002|p=28}}

==Language==
{{Main|Brahui language}}
The Brahui language is a Dravidian language, even though it is very far from South India. It is mainly spoken in the Kalat areas of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], Pakistan, and in Southern Afghanistan, as well as by an unknown very small number of expatriates in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf states]], [[Turkmenistan]], as well as Iranian [[Balochistan (Iran)|Balochistan]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=bCkaAQAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; It has three dialects: Sarawani (spoken in the north), Jhalawani (spoken in the southeast), and Chaghi (spoken in the northwest and west)  The 2013 edition of Ethnologue reports that there are some 4.2 million speakers; 4 million live in Pakistan, mainly in the province of Balochistan. Due to its isolation, Brahui's vocabulary is only 15% Dravidian, while the remainder is dominated by [[Balochi language|Balochi]], and [[Indo-Aryan languages]] (for example, of the number names from "one" to "ten," "four" through "ten" are borrowed from Persian). Brahui is generally written in the [[Perso-Arabic script]] and there is even a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] that has been developed for use with Brahui.

===Dialects===
Kalat, Jhalawan, and Sarawan, with Kalat as the standard dialect.

At present Brahui is spoken in [[Pakistani Balochistan]], Afghanistan, [[Turkmenistan]], [[Sindh]] and the Persian Gulf [[Arab]] states.

==Genetics==
Brahuis display a variety of [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-DNA]] [[haplogroups]], the most important being haplogroup [[Haplogroup R1a (Y-DNA)|R1a1a-M17]](35% to 39.09%) - with its mass diffusion among populations of [[Central Asia|Central]]/[[South Asia]] and associated with the early eastern migrations of [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] nomads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Separating the post-Glacial coancestry of European and Asian Y chromosomes within haplogroup R1a| pmc=2987245 | pmid=19888303 | doi=10.1038/ejhg.2009.194| volume=18| year=2010| journal=Eur.

According to Quintana-Murci et al. (2004), the Brahui population has a high prevalence (55%) of western Eurasian mtDNAs and the lowest frequency in the region (21%) of [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M]]*, which is common (∼60%) among the Dravidian-speaking Indians. So the possibility of the Dravidian presence in Baluchistan originating from recent entry of Dravidians of India should be excluded. It also shows their maternal gene pool is similar to Indo-Iranian speakers. The present Brahui population may have originated from ancient Indian Dravidian-speakers who may have relocated to Baluchistan and admixed with locals; however, no historical record supports this. So it is suggested that they are the last northern survivors of a larger Dravidian-speaking region before Indo-Iranian arrived. This would, if true, reinforce the proto-Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quintana-Murci|first=Lluís|last2=Chaix|first2=Raphaëlle|last3=Wells|first3=R.

'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty in '''[[Nigeria]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/11/waiting-endlessly-nigeria-death-row-2013112094420106741.html | title=Waiting endlessly on Nigeria's death row | work=[[Al Jazeera]] | author=Ayodeji Adeyemi | date=4 December 2013 | accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Methods of executions include [[hanging]] and [[Execution by firing squad|shooting]] and capital crimes include [[murder]], [[Terrorism|terrorism-related offenses]], [[rape]], [[robbery]], [[kidnapping]], [[sodomy]], [[homosexuality]], [[blasphemy]], [[adultery]], [[incest]], assisting the [[suicide]] of a person legally unable to consent, [[perjury]] in a capital case causing wrongful execution, [[treason]], some military offences like [[mutiny]] and practice of indigenous beliefs in states applying Shariah law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Nigeria |title=The Death Penalty in Nigeria |publisher=Death Penalty Worldwide |accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Nigerian military juntas of 1966–79 and 1983–98]], the government used capital punishment against political opponents, most notoriously when General [[Sani Abacha]] ordered the execution of the [[Ogoni Nine]] by hanging in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deseretnews.com/article/450161/NIGERIAS-MILITARY-LEADERS-HANG-PLAYWRIGHT-AND-8-OTHER-ACTIVISTS.html?pg=all&lt;/ref&gt; Since the transition to democracy, executions have become rare; no executions took place between 2006 and 2013, when four prisoners on [[death row]] were hanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Nigeria | title=The Death Penalty in Nigeria | publisher=Death Penalty Worldwide | date=19 June 2014 | accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a thousand prisoners were awaiting execution at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Politics this week|url=http://audio.economist.com/news/world-week/21580204-politics-week|accessdate=31 January 2018|publisher=The Economist, page 8|date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, there were no more executions until 2016, when Nigeria hanged 3 men for [[murder]] and [[armed robbery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Death sentences and executions in 2016|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/ |publisher= amnesty.org |accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These executions were the last to date in Nigeria.

On 17 December 2014, after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit mutiny, 54 Nigerian soldiers were sentenced to death by firing squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30526725 | title=Nigerian soldiers given death penalty for mutiny | work=[[BBC News]] | date=17 December 2014 | accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was held secretly by a military tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nnochiri|first1=Ikechukwu|title=Alleged mutiny: Hon flays secret trial, conviction of soldiers|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/12/alleged-mutiny-hon-flays-secret-trial-conviction-soldiers/|accessdate=31 January 2018|publisher=Vanguard (Nigeria)|date=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the death penalty in Nigeria has generated varied opinions among people in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/93561-dons_disagree_on_abolition_of_death_penalty_in_nigeria.html | title=Dons disagree on abolition of death penalty in Nigeria | work=[[Premium Times]] | accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, former Governor of [[Delta State]] [[Emmanuel Uduaghan]] pardoned three inmates who were on death row following the recommendations by the State Advisory Council on Prerogative of Mercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.informationng.com/2014/10/uduaghan-pardons-77-year-old-on-death-row.html | title=Uduaghan Pardons 77-year-old On Death Row | work=Information Nigeria | date=7 October 2014 | accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Nigerian government has rejected the call by Amnesty International to halt the planned execution of some inmates on death row in Lagos State, and pointed that the death penalty was expressly authorized by section 33 of the [[Constitution of Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dailypost.ng/2017/04/29/death-penalty-cannot-decide-nigeria-fg-carpets-amnesty-international/ |title=Death penalty: You cannot decide for Nigeria – FG carpets Amnesty International |publisher= dailypost.ng |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''change of command''' is a military tradition that represents a formal transfer of authority and responsibility for a unit from one [[Commanding officer|commanding]] or [[flag officer]] to another. The passing of [[Colours, standards and guidons|colors]], [[War flag|standards]], or [[ensigns]] from an outgoing commander to an incoming one ensures that the unit and its soldiers is never without official leadership, a continuation of trust, and also signifies an allegiance of soldiers to their unit's commander.

Great symbolism is attached to the ceremonial aspects of a change of command.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8U_LOzzKnc The Passage of the Commandants - Gen. Amos takes command of the Marine Corps] minute 2:41 and following/13:16. This is also the citation for the coupled sets of orders below, the first for the outgoing commander minute 2:46/13:16, the second for the incoming commander minute 3:13/1316&lt;/ref&gt; An inspection and review of soldiers, [[21 gun salute|gun salutes]], as well as a [[military band]] will often be incorporated into the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sequence of Events for Change of Command Ceremony|publisher=United States Army|url=http://www.hqusareur.army.mil/band/img/PDF/sample_ceremony.PDF}}{{Dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a Command Sergeant Major, the transferred item might be a saber during a Change of Responsibility, while for a Chaplain, the item might be the passing of a [[Stole (vestment)|Clerical Stole]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.army.mil/article/207991/i_corps_change_of_stole_ceremony I Corps Change of Stole Ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2972">'''Chumburung''' is a kingdom and traditional area in the western part of [[Kpandai District|Kpandae District]] in the [[Northern Region (Ghana)|Northern Region]] of [[Ghana]]. It is the homeland of the [[Chumburu]], but [[Bassar]]i, [[Gonja people|Gonja]]s, [[Kokomba people|Kokomba]]s and [[Nawuri]](s) are also indigenous in the area. Land, however, can only be acquired with the permission of the village chief and the king, who are both natives and officials of the Chumburung kingdom. '''Chumburung''' is also the name of the [[Chumburung language|language]] of the Chumburu.

The kingdom of Chumburung encompasses a number of villages at both sides of the [[Dakar River]], from [[Kojobonipe]] in the North to [[Lonto]] in the South-West and [[Wiae]] in the East, both on the shores of [[Lake Volta]]. Other towns and villages in the kingdom, roughly from North to South, are [[Ekumdepe]] (Kumdi for short), [[Ba(n)kamba]], [[Chakori, Ghana|Chakori]], [[Nanjiro]], [[Tori, Ghana|Tori]], [[Jamboae]] and [[Kachanka, Ghana|Kachanka]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northernghanapeoples.co.uk/ , section about Chumburung, must be corrected in a number of ways. Most important, the kingdom of Chumburung does not spread across Lake Volta toward [[Banda, Ghana|Banda]] and beyond. These parts of [[Volta Region]] belong to the kingdom and traditional area of [[Krachi (disambiguation)|Krachi]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;. Furthermore, [[Kabesi]] is an exclave of the [[Nawuri]] kingdom around the town of [[Kpandae]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Chumburung is remote from the modern world in many senses. The few roads that exist in the area can only be plied by heavy vehicles, such as lorries, Benz buses in good condition, strong pick-ups and 4WD vehicles. Since few inhabitants can afford such means of transport for private use, the most popular vehicle is the motorcycle. Public transport consists of one Benz daily between [[Kpandae]] and [[Salaga]] (leaving Kpandae at dawn, arriving in Salaga around 10 a.m., and returning in the afternoon) and one Benz bus daily between [[Banda, Ghana|Banda]] and Salaga, serving almost all the villages of Chumburung (leaving Banda at dawn and also returning in the afternoon).

Up to now (April, 2014), Chumburung is not connected to any electricity network and few inhabitants have their own generators, but [[Volta River Authority]] is in the process of connecting some of the towns to its grid. The only telephone company that is active in the area is [[MTN Group|MTN]], but inhabitants of Wiae may get coverage from the [[Airtel Africa]] pole in Banda.

The first schools in Chumburung were set up by [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] teachers in the 1980s; they were later followed by others who started to teach in the local languages including Chumburung.

A '''conservation economy''' is an ideal, imagined [[economy]] in which [[Wealth (economics)|economic wealth]] is harvested from a [[Ecoregion|bioregion's]] local [[natural resource]]s in a way that meets local communities' needs yet restores rather than depletes [[natural capital|natural]] and [[social capital|social]] [[Capital (economics)|capital]]&lt;ref name="Dabson01"&gt;[http://www.frbkc.org/PUBLICAT/Exploring/RC01Dabs.pdf Dabson, Brian (2001) "Supporting Rural Entrepreneurship" Federal Reserve Bank of Kanasas city website] Accessed 26 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In a conservation economy, economic arrangements of all kinds are gradually redesigned so that they restore, rather than deplete, natural capital and social capital...Even in a globalizing economy, diverse bioregional economies that are more self-sufficient in meeting their own needs will be more competitive and less vulnerable..."&lt;ref name="ConservationEconomy01"&gt;[http://www.conservationeconomy.net/conservation_economy.html ConservationEconomy.Net's "Conservation Economy" webpage] Accessed 12 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The primary agents expected to ultimately transform local economies and move bioregions towards locally resilient and enduring 'conservation economies' are small plus medium-sized business owners ('conservation entrepreneurs') who embrace a [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation ethic]] and take a rational self-interest in maintaining and restoring local [[ecosystem]]s&lt;ref name="Dabson01"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Individuals and organizations that see its potential and acquire the skills to build [a conservation economy] will create ongoing and enduring economic opportunities. Individuals and organizations that continue to depend on the depletion of social and natural capital will face increasingly unpredictable global commodity markets, tightening laws and regulations, new taxes, public outrage, loss of motivation, and many other symptoms of economic transformation"&lt;ref name="ConservationEconomy01"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Key advocates spending many years taking a lead in promoting the benefits of conservation economies and investing in local businesses to help build conservation economies have been the not-for-profit organization, [[Ecotrust]], (founded in 1991 by economist [[Ecotrust|Spencer Beebe]]) and its partners: Ecotrust Canada, ShoreBank Pacific, and ShoreBank Enterprise Pacific&lt;ref name="Pincus01"&gt;[http://www.conservationeconomy.net/pdfs/Social_Capital_Sustainability.pdf Neilsen-Pincus, Max (2002) "Social Capital &amp; Sustainability: A Qualitative Study of Community Leaders in the Conservation Economy".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13368">The '''cost of raising a child''' varies from country to country.

The cost of raising a child is usually determined according to a formula that accounts for major areas of expenditure, such as food, housing, and clothing. However, any given family's actual expenses may differ from the estimates. For example, the [[renting|rent]] on a home does not usually change when the tenants have another child, so the family's housing costs may remain the same. In other cases, the home may be too small, in which case the family might move to a larger home at a higher cost.

==Developing countries==
According to Globalissues.org, "Almost half the world—over three billion people—live on less than $2.50 a day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Shah | first = Anup | title = Poverty Facts and Stats | publisher = Global Issues | date = September 20, 2010 | url = http://www.globalissues.org/article/26/poverty-facts-and-stats | accessdate = August 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[statistic]] includes children. Based on UNICEF statistics, in developing countries the cost is roughly [[US Dollar|US$]]900 for raising a child for a year, and US$16,200 for raising a child from birth to age 17.&lt;ref name="unicef1"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/sowc05/english/index.html State of the World's Children, 2005], UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt; (This calculation is difficult, since families in developing countries often do not operate with currency, but barter or trade to provide for their children.)&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ravallion, Shaohua Chen and Prem Sangraula, [http://go.worldbank.org/3KL75ZFJ60 Dollar a day revisited], World Bank, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Half of all children in the world live in [[poverty]].&lt;ref name="unicef1" /&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The annual LV= ([[Liverpool Victoria]]) Cost of a Child report calculates the cost of raising a child from birth to 21 years old. The latest report puts the cost as £231,843.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lv.com/life-cover/cost-of-a-child|title=Cost of a child {{!}} LV=|website=www.lv.com|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cost of a child calculations, from birth to 21 years, were compiled by the Centre of Economic and Business Research (CEBR) for LV= in December 2015 and are based on the cost for the 21-year period to December 2015. Additional research was conducted by [[Opinium Research LLP]] from 22 to 27 January 2016. The total sample size was 1,000 UK adults with children under the age of 18 and was conducted online. Results have been weighted to nationally representative criteria

==United States==
Based on a [[Statistical survey|survey]] by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], the table below shows the estimated Average Spending on Children by Families. The data comes from the Consumer Expenditure Survey by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], conducted from 2005-06. The figures have been updated to 2011 dollars using the [[Consumer Price Index]].  However, some dispute the numbers as being biased high for political reasons (e.g., Texas A&amp;M University Finance Professor H. Swint Friday: "The numbers, reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, are outrageously misleading. Often government statistics are produced for political objectives that cause the research methodology to be biased toward finding the highest dollar amount to support the objective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Friday| first = H. Swint| title = Cost of raising children not as high as government would have you believe  | publisher = caller.com | date = July 20, 2007 | url = http://www.caller.com/news/2007/jul/20/cost-of-raising-children-not-as-high-as-would/ | accessdate = March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

These figures from the USDA go up to age 18, and do not include any [[higher education|college or university education]]. Nor does it offer any spending estimates if the child remains in the home as a [[Dependant|dependent]] after the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Business/page?id=4019746&lt;/ref&gt;

Both tables are for the [[United States]] overall, not based on any specific region in the country.

The '''doctrine of signatures''', dating from the time of [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]] and [[Galen]], states that herbs resembling various parts of the body can be used by [[herbalist]]s to treat ailments of those body parts. A theological justification, as stated by botanists such as [[William Coles (botanist)|William Coles]], was that God would have wanted to show men what plants would be useful for.

It is today considered to be [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/07/fantastically-wrong-doctrine-of-signatures/ |title=Fantastically Wrong: The Strange History of Using Organ-Shaped Plants to Treat Disease |last=Simon |first=Matt |date=14 August 2014 |website=Wired |publisher=Condé Nast |access-date=7 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has led to many deaths and severe illnesses. For instance [[birthwort]], once used widely for pregnancies, is carcinogenic and very damaging to the kidneys, owing to its [[aristolochic acid]] content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepoisongarden.co.uk/atoz/aristolochia_clematitis.htm |title=Aristolochia, birthwort |last=Robertson |first=John |date= |website=The Poison Garden |publisher=John Robertson |access-date=7 March 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a defense against [[predation]], many plants contain toxic chemicals the action of which is not immediately apparent, or easily tied to the plant rather than other factors.

== History ==
[[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541) developed the concept, writing that "Nature marks each growth&amp;nbsp;... according to its curative benefit",&lt;ref name=ScienceMus/&gt; and it was followed by [[Giambattista della Porta]] in his ''Phytognomonica'' (1588).

The writings of [[Jakob Böhme]] (1575–1624) spread the doctrine of signatures. He suggested that God marked objects with a sign, or "signature", for their purpose.&lt;ref name=Pearce&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&amp;ArtikelNr=131714&amp;Ausgabe=237347&amp;ProduktNr=223840&amp;filename=131714.pdf |format=PDF |journal=European Neurology |date=May 16, 2008
| author=Pearce, J.M.S. |publisher=karger.com |title=The Doctrine of Signatures |accessdate=August 31, 2008 |doi=10.1159/000131714 |pmid=18520149 |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Plants bearing parts that resembled human body-parts, animals, or other objects were thought to have useful relevance to those parts, animals or objects. The "signature" could sometimes also be identified in the environments or specific sites in which plants grew. Böhme's 1621 book ''The Signature of All Things'' gave its name to the doctrine.&lt;ref name=ScienceMus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/doctrine.aspx |title=Doctrine of Signatures |publisher=Science Museum |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English physician-philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in his discourse [[The Garden of Cyrus]] (1658) uses the [[Quincunx]] pattern as an archetype of the 'doctrine of signatures' pervading the design of gardens and orchards, botany and the Macrocosm at large.  

The [[botanist]] [[William Coles (botanist)|William Coles]] (1626–1662) supposed that God had made 'Herbes for the use of men, and hath given them particular Signatures, whereby a man may read&amp;nbsp;... the use of them.'&lt;ref name=ScienceMus/&gt; Coles's ''The Art of Simpling'' and ''Adam in Eden'', stated that [[walnuts]] were good for curing head ailments because in his opinion, "they Have the perfect Signatures of the Head". Regarding ''[[Hypericum]]'', he wrote, "The little holes whereof the leaves of Saint Johns wort are full, doe resemble all the pores of the skin and therefore it is profitable for all hurts and wounds that can happen thereunto."&lt;ref name=Pearce/&gt;

A theological justification was made for this philosophy: "It was reasoned that the Almighty must have set his sign upon the various means of curing disease which he provided".{{sfnp|White|1896|p=38}}

For the late medieval viewer, the natural world was vibrant with images of the Deity: 'as above, so below,' a [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] principle expressed as the relationship between [[macrocosm and microcosm]]; the principle is rendered ''sicut in terra''.  [[Michel Foucault]] expressed the wider usage of the doctrine of signatures, which rendered [[allegory]] more real and more cogent than it appears to a modern eye:
{{quote|Up to the end of the sixteenth century, resemblance played a constructive role in the knowledge of Western culture. It was resemblance that largely guided [[exegesis]] and the interpretation of texts; it was resemblance that organized the play of symbols, made possible knowledge of things visible and invisible, and controlled the art of representing them." (''The Order of Things'' , p. 17)}}

=== Signatures of some plants used in herbalism ===
[[File:Pulmonaria officinalis DSC 7887c.jpg|thumb|[[Pulmonaria officinalis|Lungwort]] was thought to have the signature of the lungs and was used to treat lung infections.]]
The concept of signatures is reflected in the common names of some plants whose shapes and colors reminded herbalists of the parts of the body where they were thought to do good, as for instance:

* [[Eyebright]], used for [[eye]] infections&lt;ref name=ScienceMus/&gt;
* [[Hedge woundwort]], thought to have [[antiseptic]] qualities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.incredible-edible-todmorden.co.uk/apothecary/hedge-woundwort |title=Hedge Woundwort |author=McDougal, Kevin |date=2013 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Liverwort, either [[Marchantiophyta]] or [[Hepatica]] – used to treat the [[liver]]{{sfnp|Stern|1991|p=338}}
* [[Lungwort]] – used for [[pulmonary]] infections&lt;ref name=Birmingham&gt;{{cite web |title=The Tudors |url=http://www.birminghambotanicalgardens.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/tudors.pdf |publisher=Birmingham Botanical Gardens |accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Spleenwort]], ''Asplenium'' – used to treat the [[spleen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irvine|first1=Alexander|title=The Phytologist: A Botanical Journal, Volume 4|date=1860|publisher=William Pamplin|page=308|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8cgAQAAMAAJ|quote=As late as 1657 we find William Coles, who was a herbarist ... speaking of Spleenwort, or Miltwort, tells us that the learned Crollius, amongst the signatures of parts, doth set down Ceterach to have the signature of the spleen, and that therefore it is profitable for all diseases thereof;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cardamine|Toothwort]], ''Dentaria'' – used for [[tooth]] ailments

Concepts similar to the doctrine of signatures may be found in folk or indigenous medicines, and in modern [[alternative medicine]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== In literature ==

The phrase "signatures of all things" appears in the beginning of episode 3 in James Joyce's novel Ulysses. The character Stephen Dedalus walking along the beach, thinking to himself "Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot". The Canadian poet [[Anne Szumigalski]], 1922–1999, entitled her third full-length collection "Doctrine of Signatures".

== Scientific skepticism ==

The signatures are described as [[Post hoc ergo propter hoc|post hoc attributions]] and [[mnemonics]],&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=Bradley C. |authorlink= | date=  2007 |title= Doctrine of Signatures: An Explanation of Medicinal Plant Discovery or Dissemination of Knowledge? |journal=Economic Botany |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=246–255 |url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1663%2F0013-0001(2007)61%5B246%3ADOSAEO%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |quote= |doi=10.1663/0013-0001(2007)61[246:DOSAEO]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0013-0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of value only in creating a system for remembering actions attributed to medical herbs. There is no scientific evidence that plant shapes and colors help in the discovery of medical uses of plants.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;

Another explanation is that the human mind, in trying to find patterns to explain phenomena, while lacking adequate scientific knowledge, resorts to [[anthropomorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buchanan |first=Scott|date=2014 |title=The Doctrine of Signatures, A Defence of Theory in Medicine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HevgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142 |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |page=142 |isbn= 0415614155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the community made [[aliyah]]  from Ethiopia to Israel in two waves of mass immigration assisted by the Israeli government: [[Operation Moses]] (1984) and [[Operation Solomon]] (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weil, Shalva|date=2011|title="Operation Solomon 20 Years On"|publisher=International Relations and Security Network (ISN)|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/ISN-Insights/Detail?ord538=grp1&amp;ots591=eb06339b-2726-928e-0216-1b3f15392dd8&amp;lng=en&amp;id=129480&amp;contextid734=129480&amp;contextid735=129244&amp;tabid=129244|accessdate=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Shalva 2007 Operation Solomon by Stephen Spector, reviewed in Studies in Contemporary Jewry, an Annual, New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press 22: 341–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Today Israel is home to the largest Beta Israel community in the world with about 125,500 citizens of Ethiopian descent in 2011,&lt;ref name="The Ethiopian Population In Israel"/&gt; who are mainly assembled in the smaller urban areas of central Israel.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Oz Almog, [http://www.peopleil.org/details.aspx?itemID=7653&amp;searchMode=0&amp;index=7 "Residential patterns among olim from Ethiopia], Published in 2008 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===First wave (1934–1960)===
The first Ethiopian Jews who settled in [[Israel]] in the modern times came in 1934 along with the [[History of the Jews in Eritrea|Yemenite Jews]] from [[Italian Eritrea]].

===Second wave: (1961–1975)===
[[Image:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - MIN. OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE YITZHAK NAVON VISITING A KINDERGARTEN CLASS OF YOUNG IMMIGRANTS FROM ETHIOPIA.jpg|thumb|Minister of Education [[Yitzhak Navon]] visiting kindergarten class of Ethiopian immigrants]]

Between the years 1963 and 1975 a relatively small group of Beta Israel emigrated to Israel. The Beta Israel immigrants in that period were mainly very few men who have studied and came to Israel on a tourist visa and then remained in the country illegally.

Several of their supporters in Israel, who recognized their "[[Jewishness]]" decided to assist them. These supporters began organizing in associations, among others under the direction of Ovadia Hazzi, an Eritrean-born Yemeni Jew who married a Beta Israel woman in Israel. Several of the illegal immigrants managed to get their status with the Israeli authorities regularized through the assistance of these support associations. Some agreed to "convert" to Judaism, which helped them regulated their personal status and remain in Israel. People who get their regularization often brought their families to Israel as well.

In 1973, Ovadia Hazzi officially raised the question of the "Jewishness" of the Beta Israel to Israel's Sephardi Chief Rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]]. The rabbi, citing a rabbinic ruling from the 16th century [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]], asserted that the Beta Israel are descended from the [[Ten Lost Tribes|lost tribe]] of [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]], and eventually acknowledged their "Jewishness" in February 1973. This ruling was initially rejected by the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi [[Shlomo Goren]], who eventually changed his opinion on the matter in 1974.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In April 1975, the Israeli government of [[Yitzhak Rabin]] officially accepted the Beta Israel as Jews, for the purpose of the [[Law of Return]] (An Israeli act which grants all the Jews in the world the right to immigrate to Israel).

Later on, Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] obtained clear rulings from Chief Sephardi Rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]] that they were descendants of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]]. The [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] did however initially require them to undergo ''pro forma'' [[Conversion to Judaism|Jewish conversions]], to remove any doubt as to their Jewish status.

===Third Wave: (1975–1990)===
====Operation Brothers====
[[File:Falasha migration2.jpg|thumb|right|Migration map of Beta Israel]]
* '''November 1979–1983''': Aliyah activists and [[Mossad]] agents operating in Sudan called Beta Israel to come to Sudan, and from Sudan they would be taken to Israel via Europe. Jewish Ethiopian refugees from the Ethiopian Civil War in the mid 1970's began to arrive at the refugee camps in Sudan. Most Beta Israel came from [[Tigray Province|Tigray]] and [[Wolqayt]], regions that were controlled by the [[TPLF]] which often escorted them to the Sudanese border.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrit Jan Abbink, ''The Falashas In Ethiopia And Israel: The Problem of Ethnic Assimilation'', Nijmegen, Institute for Cultural and Social Anthropology, 1984, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Many Ethiopian Jews also immigrated to Israel to flee the war culture, hostility toward Ethiopian Jews, and famine in Ethiopia during and after the civil war.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Stephen|date=1988|title=The Beta Israel and the Rabbinate: Law, Ritual and Politics|url=|journal=Social Science Information|volume=27|pages=357-370|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the [[Jewish Defense League]] protested the "lack of action" to rescue Ethiopian Jews by taking over the main offices of HIAS in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jta.org/1981/09/09/archive/jdl-stages-protests-at-hias-jewish-agency-offices-claiming-lack-of-action-to-rescue-falashas|title=Jdl Stages Protests at Hias, Jewish Agency Offices, Claiming ‘lack of Action’ to Rescue Falashas|last=|first=|date=September 9, 1981|newspaper=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|location=New York|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1983 – March 28, 1985''': this emigration wave was in part motivated by word to mouth reports on the success of the emigration of many Jewish refugees to Israel. In 1983 the governor of [[Begemder|Gondar]] region, Major [[Melaku Teferra]] was ousted as governor and his successor removed restrictions on travel.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell G. Bard, ''From Tragedy to Triumph: The Politics Behind the Rescue of Ethiopian Jewry'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Beta Israel began to arrive in large numbers and the Mossad did not manage to evacuate them in time. Following the poor conditions in camps, many refugees died of disease and hunger. Among these victims, it is estimated that between 2,000 and 5,000 were Beta Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, ''From Tragedy to Triumph'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1984, the Sudanese government, following the intervention of the United States, allowed the emigration of 7,200 Beta Israel refugees to Europe who immediately flew from there to Israel. There two immigration waves were: [[Operation Moses]] (original name "The Lion of Judah’s Cub") which took place between November 20, 1984, until January 20, 1985, during which 6,500 people emigrated to Israel. This operation was followed by the a few weeks later, which was conducted by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], in which the 494 Beta Israel refugees remaining in Sudan were evacuated to Israel. The second operation was mainly carried out due to the intervention and international pressure of the United States.

===Fourth Wave (1990–1999)===
* '''1991 ([[Operation Solomon]])''': In 1991, the political and economic stability of Ethiopia deteriorated, as rebels mounted attacks against and eventually controlled the capital city of [[Addis Ababa]]. Worried about the fate of the Beta Israel during the transition period, the Israeli government along with several private groups prepared to continue covertly with the migration. Over the course of the next 36 hours, a total of 34 [[El Al]] [[airliner|passenger planes]], with their seats removed to maximize passenger capacity, flew 14,325 Beta Israel non-stop to Israel. Again, the operation was mainly carried out due to the intervention and international pressure of the U.S.  Dr. Rick Hodes, an American doctor who emigrated to Ethiopia, was the medical director for Operation Solomon.  It was a difficult two days as he covertly arranged for a number of very ill people to be transported on these planes to Israel.
* '''1992–1999''': During these years, the [[Qwara Province|Qwara]] Beta Israel emigrated to Israel.

===Falash Mura===
* '''1993–present''': From 1993 onwards, an irregular emigration began of [[Falash Mura|Felesmura]], which was and still is mainly subjected to political developments in Israel. These immigrants are required to convert to normative Judaism.&lt;ref name="Complexities of Conversion among the Felesmura"&gt;Weil, S., 2016. “The Complexities of Conversion among the ‘Felesmura’”.

==Absorption in Israel==
[[File:falasha makstyle.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Beta Israel soldier in [[Nablus]], 2006]]
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 21546 Absorption center in Mevaseret Zion.JPG|200px|thumb|right|The entrance to [[Mevaseret Zion]] Absorption Center, 2010]]
Ethiopian Beta Israel are gradually becoming part of the mainstream Israeli society in religious life, military service (with nearly all males doing national service), education, and politics. Similarly to other groups of immigrant Jews, who made [[aliyah]] to Israel, the Ethiopian Beta Israel have faced obstacles in their integration to Israeli society. The Ethiopian Beta Israel community's internal challenges have been complicated by: entering a relatively modern country (Israel) from non-modern, rural, remote regions of Ethiopia (compared with other immigrant groups entering from industrialized countries and who typically possess significantly greater formal education); the disruption of longstanding hierarchies and customs within Beta Israel in which elders lead and guide their community; some racial prejudice, echoing racism that has existed in neighboring Middle Eastern countries and in 'Western' countries; a degree of lingering doubt within a minority of groups, regarding the 'Jewishness' of certain Ethiopians (e,g., the [[Falash Mura]]). However, with successive generations, Ethiopian Israelis have climbed in Israeli society.

Individual Ethiopian Beta Israel had lived in Eretz Yisrael prior to the establishment of the state. A youth group arrived in Israel in the 1950s to undergo training in Hebrew education and returned to Ethiopia to educate young Beta Israeli community members there. Also, Ethiopian Beta Israel had been trickling into Israel prior to the 1970s.  The numbers of such Ethiopian immigrants grew after the Israeli government officially recognized them in 1973 as Jews, entitled to Israeli citizenship.&lt;ref name="EthnicCit"&gt;Fenter, "Ethnicity", p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare for the absorption of tens of thousands of Ethiopian Beta Israel, the State of Israel prepared two `Master Plans’ (Ministry of Absorption, 1985, 1991).  The first was prepared in 1985, a year after the arrival of the first wave of immigrants.  The second updated the first in response to the second wave of immigration in 1991 from Ethiopia. The first Master Plan contained an elaborate and detailed program. It covered issues of housing, education, employment and practical organization, together with policy guidelines regarding specific groups, including women, youths, and single -parent families. Like earlier absorption policies, it adopted a procedural approach which assumed that the immigrants were broadly similar to the existing majority population of Israel. The Plans were created with a firm belief in assimilation. As noted in this section, results have been disappointing and suggest that much greater attention needs to be paid to issues of ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/~tobiws/ethiopian.pdf#search='Ethiopian%20women%20in%20Israel|title=Ethnicity, Citiz enship, Planning and Gender: the case of Ethiopian immigrant women in Israel|author=Tovi Fenster|website=Tac.ac.il|accessdate=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a November 17, 1999, [[BBC]] article, a report commissioned by Israel's Ministry of Immigrant Absorption stated that 75% of the 70,000 Ethiopian Beta Israel community, living in Israel in 1999 could not read or write Hebrew.  More than half the population could not hold a simple conversation in the Hebrew language.  Unlike Russian immigrants, many of whom arrive with job skills, Ethiopians came from a [[subsistence economy]] and were ill-prepared to work in an industrialized society. Since then much progress has been made.  Through military service most Ethiopian Beta Israel have been able to increase their chances for better opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/524662.stm|title=Ethiopian Jews struggle in Israel|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today most Ethiopian Beta Israel have been for the most part integrated into Israeli society, however a high drop out rate is a problem, although a higher number are now edging towards the higher areas of society.

In September, 2006, the Israeli government's proposed 2007 budget included reducing Ethiopian immigration from 600 persons per month to 150.  On the eve of the [[Knesset]] vote, the Prime Minister's office announced that the plan had been dropped.  Advocates for the Falash Mura noted that although the quota was set at 600 per month in March, 2005, actual immigration has remained at 300 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Urile|last=Heilman|author=|coauthors=|title=Falash Mura supporters hail vote to keep monthly immigration steady|url=http://www.jewishledger.com/articles/2006/11/17/news/on_the_cover/news01.txt|work=|publisher=Connecticut Jewish Ledger|pages=22, 26|date=2006-11-17|accessdate=2006-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929142825/http://www.jewishledger.com/articles/2006/11/17/news/on_the_cover/news01.txt#|archive-date=September 29, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BetaIsrael1908Letter.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The official letter written in October 1908 in the [[Ge'ez]] script by the Beta Israel leadership, which was intended for the various Jewish communities worldwide.]]
The first contact with Israel generally led to a [[culture shock]] amongst many of the new immigrants. Many of the Beta Israel immigrants, especially those who came from remote villages in Ethiopia, had never used electricity, elevators, flush toilets or televisions. In addition, the adaptation to the [[Israeli cuisine]] was difficult.

The breakup of many of the close and extended families after being brought to the various integration centers in Israel, as well as the initial integration with the Israeli society was very difficult for many of the new immigrants. Name changing also caused a symbolic break with the new immigrants' past. The Israeli authorities originally gave many of the new immigrants Hebrew [[given name]]s, Hebrew names, and required them all to have [[family names]], which did not exist in the Ethiopian society. These name changes created a two tier system, in which old and new names were used by the new immigrants. The immersion with the Hebrew language was not easy for the new immigrants, and the majority of the new immigrants never managed to master the language, even after living many years in Israel, resulting in a strong social marginalization. Finally, the [[#The adaptation of the religious leadership|questioning of their traditional religious practices]] by the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] led to great confusion amongst the new immigrants.

[[File:Women at kotel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ethiopian women at the [[Western Wall|Kotel]] in [[Jerusalem]] during Hol HaMoed (the week of) [[Passover]].]]

[[Shas]]'s spiritual mentor, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, enthusiastically embraced Ethiopians when they first began immigrating to Israel.  Despite Rabbi Ovadia's halachic ruling, some refuse to marry Ethiopians without a conversion in accordance with official Chief Rabbinate policy. Only in cities and towns with rabbis that accept Ovadia's ruling or the ruling of Rabbi [[Shlomo Goren]] are Ethiopians married without immersion in a ritual bath (mikva) or, for men, ''hatafat dam'', הטפת דם, see ''[[brit milah]]''), the symbolic cut to produce a drop of blood instead of circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1138622564484&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=Israeli News Covering Israel &amp; The Jewish World|website=Fr.jpost.com|accessdate=2017-08-27}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious leadership==
Regarding religious leadership, 60 Kessim (priests) of the Ethiopian immigrants in Israel are employed by the [[Ministry of Religious Services]], and many of them conduct religious ceremonies in Israel. They are however not recognized as [[rabbi]]s and do not have the authority to perform marriages.  Nevertheless, a new generation of rabbis of Ethiopian origin trained in Israel are gradually taking over.&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Shalva 1995 'Representations of Leadership among Ethiopian Jews' in Steven Kaplan, Tudor Parfitt and Emanuela Trevisan Semi (eds) Between Africa &amp; Zion, Proceedings of the first International Conference of Sosteje, Venice, 1993, pp. 230–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomic status==
The biggest challenge to the Israeli Ethiopian Beta Israel community probably lies in the very low level of formal education of the immigrants. With few exceptions, when they first arrived to Israel they had no useful training for a developed economy like that of Israel, and in addition to that they did not know [[Hebrew]]. Due to the oral nature of rural living in Ethiopia, illiteracy was very common (according to one estimate, 90% among adults aged 37 and above),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Bjc2p_LHpYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=For+our+soul:+Ethiopian+Jews+in+Israel&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=For Our Soul: Ethiopian Jews in Israel|first=Teshome G.|last=Wagaw|date=August 27, 1993|publisher=Wayne State University Press|accessdate=August 27, 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; although young people were better educated and a minority group amongst the Beta Israel immigrants did attend secondary schools in Ethiopia. Regarding the recent immigration of Falash Mura, NGOs (such as the ''North American Conference on Ethiopian Jewry'') have attempted to provide those who have been waiting for years in Ethiopia their immigration basic useful training for immigrants in Israel, as well as basic common concepts in Hebrew. Nevertheless, it is estimated that circa 80% of adult Felesmura become unemployed in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Shlomo Molla]], head of the Jewish Agency's Ethiopian Division, quoted from an article by Amiram Barkat: "Ethiopian immigrants not being prepared for new life in Israel", ''[[Haaretz]]'' 29/05/2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lack of work qualifications high unemployment is widespread: In 2005 the unemployment rate was 65% amongst those over the age of 45.&lt;ref name="haaretz-05-06-05"&gt;[[Haaretz]], ''Breaking the glass ceiling'', 05/06/2005. [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=584285 View Article].&lt;/ref&gt; The younger generations born or who have grown up in Israel are more successful in being absorbed into Israeli economy, especially due to receiving modern education, although the average rate of educated people amongst the Beta Israel community is still smaller than that of the general Jewish youth, and this factor delays the emergence of a larger middle class group of Ethiopian origin in the Israeli society. Despite this, in 2005, 3000 students graduated of higher education institutions, and 1,500 others graduated at the university.&lt;ref name="haaretz-05-06-05" /&gt; Nevertheless, even the academic graduates often experience trouble finding a job.

Low educational attainment, modest standards of living, and the occasionally isolated habitat may explain the development of [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] among the Beta Israel youth: in 2005 its rate was three times higher than the rate of the other Israeli youth.&lt;ref name="haaretz-05-06-05" /&gt;

A study published in 2012 found that members of the Beta Israel community earn 30%-40% less than [[Arab citizens of Israel]], who are themselves considered as an underprivileged group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ethiopian immigrants earning 30-40% less than Arabs |author=Hila Weisberg |url=http://www.haaretz.com/business/ethiopian-immigrants-earning-30-40-less-than-arabs-1.416551 |newspaper=The Marker  – Haaretz |date=2012-03-05 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reconcile this problem many programs have been created to better the Ethiopian Jews in Israel's socioeconomic status. One such program was Prof. Shalva Weil's program on excellence among Ethiopian Jews in Educational Leadership, run from the Hebrew University over time, women as well as men trained as leaders and informal educational leaders.&lt;ref name="The feminization of the teaching program"&gt;Weil, S., 2012, “I am a teacher and beautiful: the feminization of the teaching profession in the Ethiopian community in Israel”, in Pnina Morag- Talmon and Yael Atzmon (eds) Immigrant Women in Israeli Society, Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, pp. 207–23 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Another program is Yvel's Megemeria School. Started in 2012, with the help of Yedid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yedid.org.il/yvel|title=Yedid website|first=CoMedia Group|last=LTD.|website=Yedid.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; the established pearl jewelry designer based in Jerusalem decided to open up a school to teach a class of Ethiopian students the tricks of the trade, as well as help them with Hebrew and English language courses and provide them with valuable personal finance lessons. Upon the completion of the program, the graduates are placed in jobs within the Israeli jewelry industry. This program has been so successful that it Yvel receives hundreds of applicants every year, although it only has space for 21 students per class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yvel.com/content/12-social-contribution |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119230055/http://www.yvel.com/content/12-social-contribution |archivedate=November 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in politics==
The [[Atid Ekhad]] party sees itself as the political representative of the community, though other parties include Ethiopian members. In 2006, [[Shas]], a party representing [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews of Sephardic and Middle Eastern background, included an Ethiopian rabbi from [[Beersheba]], in its list for the [[Knesset]] in a conscious attempt to represent diverse geographic and ethnic groups. Shas was not the only party attempting to appeal to the Ethiopian vote. Herut and [[Kadima]] both had Ethiopians on their lists. Shlomo Mula, head of the [[Jewish Agency]]'s Ethiopian absorption department, was ranked 33 on Kadima's list and Avraham was number three on Herut's list.

In 2012, Israel appointed the country's first Ethiopian-born ambassador, Beylanesh Zevadia. According to the foreign minister of Israel, this represents an important milestone in fighting racism and prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=259779 J’lem appoints first Ethiopian-born ambassador]. Jerusalem Post, 02/28/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The main language used for communication among Israeli citizens and amongst the Ethiopian Beta Israel in Israel is [[Modern Hebrew]]. The majority of the Beta Israel immigrants continue to speak in [[Amharic language|Amharic]] (primarily) and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] at home with their family members and friends. The Amharic language and the Tigrinya language are written in the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez script]], originally developed for the [[Ge'ez language]] used in [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].

==Relations with Ethiopia==
Although some non-Jewish Ethiopians expressed bitterness towards the Beta Israel emigration out of Ethiopia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/20729|title=Americanchronicle.com|website=Americanchronicle.com|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ethiopian Jews have close ties with Ethiopian people and tradition. Achievements by the Ethiopian Jews like [[Hagit Yaso]] winning the [[Kokhav Nolad]] creates a sense of pride in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian government is also an important ally of Israel on the international stage. Israel often sends expertise assistance for development projects in Ethiopia. Strategically, Israel "has always aspired to protect itself by means of a [[Alliance of the periphery|non-Arab belt]] that has included at various times Iran, Turkey and Ethiopia."&lt;ref&gt;Zvi Bar'el, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1065943.html, "Why we need Turkey"], [[Ha'aretz]], February 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== Discrimination===
Controversy regarding the treatment of Ethiopian Jews began as early as the 1980s. Early that decade, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate put a policy in place that required immigrants to go through a ritual conversion ceremony, accept Rabbinic law, and - for males - be re-circumcised, with the stated goal of facilitating their assimilation to Jewish culture in Israel. By 1984, Ethiopian Jews opposed this policy, which they argued disregarded their religious practices as Jews. Many immigrants began to refuse to undergo conversion ceremonies and re-circumcision. In early 1985, the Chief Rabbinate changed the policy so that only Ethiopian Jews who wanted to marry as Jews in Israel would have to undergo the process. However, the Ethiopians still opposed the policy, which no other immigrant group in Israel had to undergo, and launched a strike on September 4, 1985. The strike aimed to achieve recognition as Jews without formal conversion or circumcision. Strikers also demanded that Ethiopians who wanted to marry as Jews should be dealt with on a case by case basis and with the involvement of Ethiopian elders. The Ethiopians set up their strike in Jerusalem, outside the office of the Chief Rabbinate. Located next to the Great Synagogue, this was a prime location because people walking to and from synagogue everyday could see the protest. Eventually, non-Ethiopian Israelis began to join the protest. The strike continued for a month, into Rosh Hashanah. Anxious for the strike to end before Yom Kippur, the Chief Rabbinate began to negotiate with the protesters. The protestors denied the compromises, and once Yom Kippur was over, the Chief Rabbinate stopped negotiating with the protestors. The protestors realized their demonstration was taking a step back, so in order to avoid humiliation they decided to accept a deal presented to them weeks prior to the end of the strike. The Ethiopian Jews and Israeli officials agreed that in order for Ethiopians to marry in Israel, they would need to apply with their local registrar. The registrar would take testimony from Ethiopian elders into account, and those who could prove Jewish lineage could get married without the conversion ceremony.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Israeli-Ethiopian men.JPG|thumb|right|Men attending a demonstration against racism and discrimination, 2012]]
In May 2015, The Jewish Daily Forward described the Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel as one that has "long complained of discrimination, racism and poverty."&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/307422/ethiopian-israelis-clash-with-police-as-anti-racism-protests-escalate/ Ethiopian Israelis Clash With Police as Anti-Racism Protests Escalate] The Jewish Daily Forward, 3 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  The absorption of Ethiopians in Israeli society represents an ambitious attempt to deny the significance of race.&lt;ref name=Rebhun/&gt; Israeli authorities, aware of the situation of most African diaspora communities in other Western countries, hosted programs to avoid setting in patterns of discrimination.&lt;ref name=Rebhun/&gt; The Ethiopian Beta Israel community's internal challenges have been complicated by perceived racist attitudes in some sectors of Israeli society and the establishment.&lt;ref name="Bookinfo"&gt;Onolemhemhen Durrenda Nash, ''The Black Jews of Ethiopia'', Scarecrow Press; Reprint edition 2002, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, racism was alleged regarding delays in admitting Ethiopian Beta Israel to Israel under the [[Law of return]].&lt;ref name=Rebhun&gt;Rebhun, Uzi, ''Jews in Israel: contemporary social and cultural patterns'', UPNE, 2004, pp. 139–40&lt;/ref&gt; However, the delay may be attributed to religious motivations rather than racism, since there was debate whether or not Beta Israel people were indeed Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2784774 | volume=27|title=Beta Israel people | pages=104–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp, Adriana 2004, p 155"&gt;Kemp, Adriana, ''Israelis in conflict: hegemonies, identities and challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, racism was alleged when the mayor of [[Or Yehuda]] refused to accept a large increase in Ethiopian immigrants due to fear of having the property of the town decrease in value or having an increase in crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ethiopian children cannot go to school in Or Yehuda while politicians argue |author=Yuval Azoulay and Yulie Khromchenko |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/ethiopian-children-cannot-go-to-school-in-or-yehuda-while-politicians-argue-1.168964 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2005-09-04 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey published by the [[Jerusalem Post]] in 2005 found that 43% of [[Israelis]] would not marry an Ethiopian and would not want their children to marry a member of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Racism alive and well in Israeli society, ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', 22 Mars 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, schoolchildren of Ethiopian ancestry were denied admission into three semi-private Haredi schools in [[Petah Tikva]]. An Israeli government official criticized the Petah Tikva Municipality and the schools. [[Shas]] spiritual leader [[Ovadia Yosef]] threatened to fire any school principal from Shas's school system who refused to receive Ethiopian students. The Israeli Education Ministry decided to pull funding from the Lamerhav, Da'at Mevinim and Darkhei Noam schools, which refused to accept the students. Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] spoke out against the rejection of Ethiopian children, calling it "a moral terror attack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=153392|title=Deal reached on Petah Tikva Ethiopian olim|website=Jpost.com|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/olmert-ethiopian-jews-are-right-to-feel-discriminated-against-1.234885|title=Olmert: Ethiopian Jews Are Right to Feel Discriminated Against|first=Barak|last=Ravid|date=December 9, 2007|publisher=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonstrations in Israel have occurred protesting the alleged racism against Ethiopian immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'': [http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/thousands-in-jerusalem-protest-racism-against-ethiopian-israelis-1.407998 Thousands in Jerusalem protest racism against Ethiopian Israelis.]  January 18, 2012.  Accessed February 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests against police brutality===
In April 2015 an Ethiopian soldier in the IDF was the victim of an unprovoked and allegedly racist attack by an Israeli policeman and the attack was caught on video. The soldier, Damas Pakedeh, was arrested and then released, after being accused of attacking the policeman. Pakadeh is an orphan who emigrated from Ethiopia with his siblings in 2008. He believes the incident was racially motivated and that if the video had not been taken, he would have been punished. Instead, the police officer and volunteer were suspended pending an investigation. Likud MK [[Avraham Neguise]] called on National Police Chief [[Yohanan Danino]] to prosecute the police officer and volunteer, saying they engaged in  “a gross violation of the basic law of respecting others and their liberty by those who are supposed to protect us.” The Jerusalem Post notes that in 2015 " there have been a series of reports in the Israeli press about alleged acts of [[police brutality]] against Ethiopian Israelis, with many in the community saying they are unfairly targeted and treated more harshly than other citizens."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Video-Police-filmed-beating-IDF-soldier-at-scene-of-suspicious-object-case-399319 Video: Police suspended after assaulting IDF soldier in incident caught on tape] The Jerusalem Post, 29 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/cops-beat-ethiopian-idf-soldier-in-alleged-racist-attack/ Cops beat Ethiopian IDF soldier in alleged racist attack] The Times of Israel, 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident of police brutality with Pakedeh and alleged brutality of officials from Israel's [[Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration]] with Walla Bayach, an Israeli of Ethiopian descent, brought the Ethiopian community to protest. Hundreds of Ethiopians participated in protests the streets of Jerusalem on April 20, 2015 to decry what they view as "rampant racism" and violence in Israel directed at their community. Israel Police Commissioner [[Yohanan Danino]] met with representatives of the Israeli Ethiopian community that day following the recent violent incidents involving police officers and members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4652484,00.html Ethiopians protest racist attack: 'Israel will be like Baltimore'] YNET, 30 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; When over a thousand people protested police brutality against Ethiopians and dark skinned Israelis, Prime MInister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] announced:“I strongly condemn the beating of the Ethiopian IDF soldier, and those responsible will be held accountable.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-condemns-police-beating-of-Ethiopian-soldier-but-calls-for-calm-amid-protests-400755 Netanyahu condemns police beating of Ethiopian soldier, but calls for calm amid protests] Jerusalem Post, 30 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Following protests and demonstrations in Tel Aviv that resulted in violence, Netanyahu planned to meet with representatives of the Ethiopian community, including Pakado. Netanyahu said the meeting would include Danino and representatives of several ministries, including Immigrant Absorption. Danino already announced that the officer who beat Pakado had been fired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/world/middleeast/ethiopian-israelis-protest-in-tel-aviv-over-police-treatment.html Anti-Police Protest in Israel Turns Violent] The New York Times, 3 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood donations===

On January 24, 1996,  [[Maariv (newspaper)|Ma'ariv]] newspaper revealed a [[Magen David Adom]] policy that drew heavy criticism in Israel and worldwide.&lt;ref name=Seeman99&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seeman | first1 = D | date = Jun 1999 | title = One people, one blood": public health, political violence, and HIV in an Ethiopian-Israeli setting | doi = 10.1023/A:1005439308374 | journal = Cult Med Psychiatry | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 159–95 | pmid = 10451801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaplan | first1 = Edward H. | date = Apr 1998 | title = Israel's ban on use of Ethiopians' blood: how many infectious donations were prevented? | url = http://www.som.yale.edu/faculty/ehk1/Lancet_Ethiopian_blood.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Lancet | volume = 351 | issue = 9109 | pages = 1127–28 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)10356-7 | pmid = 9660600 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100622164125/http://www.som.yale.edu/faculty/ehk1/Lancet_Ethiopian_blood.pdf | archivedate = June 22, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaplan | first1 = Edward H. | date = Apr–Jun 1999 | title = Implicit Valuation of a Blood-exclusion Decision | doi = 10.1177/0272989X9901900212 | journal = Med Decis Making | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 207–13 | pmid = 10231084 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the policy, which was not brought to the attention of the [[Health Minister of Israel|Israeli Ministry of Health]] or donors,  blood donations received from Ethiopian immigrants and their offspring were secretly disposed of. A later [[public inquiry]] traced this back to a misinterpretation of a 1984 instruction to mark blood donations from Ethiopian immigrants due to a relatively high prevalence of [[HBsAg]], indicative of [[Hepatitis B]] infections, in blood samples taken from this population.

A few days after the expose, ten thousand Beta Israel demonstrated in front the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Israel)|Office of the Prime Minister]]. The police force was surprised and unprepared for the violence that erupted, leading to policemen being injured by stones, sticks and steel rods. The police repelled the demonstrators with [[rubber bullets]], [[water cannons]] and [[tear gas]]. 41 policemen and 20 demonstrators were injured, and 200 cars belonging to the employees of the Prime Minister's Office were damaged.

Tests conducted on 650 Ethiopian immigrants who immigrated to Israel in 1984–1990 and 5,200 Ethiopian immigrants who immigrated in 1990–1992 revealed no HIV carriers before July 1990. Nevertheless, among the 5,200 Ethiopian immigrants who immigrated during "[[Operation Solomon]]" there were 118 HIV carriers, who made up 2.3 percent of the test population.&lt;ref name=Alkan93&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alkan | first1 = ML | last2 = Maayan | first2 = S | last3 = Belmaker | first3 = I | last4 = Arbeli | first4 = Y | last5 = Mani | first5 = N | last6 = Ben-Yshai | first6 = F | date = Jun–Jul 1993 | title = Serological markers for hepatitis B and treponemal infection among HIV carriers from Ethiopia | url = | journal = Isr J Med Sci. | volume = 29 | issue = 6–7| pages = 390–92 | pmid = 8349459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snunit.k12.il/heb_journals/chimia/55004.html] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pollack94&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pollack | first1 = S | last2 = Ben-Porath | first2 = E | last3 = Fuad | first3 = B | last4 = Raz | first4 = R | last5 = Etzioni | first5 = A | date = Aug 1994 | title = Epidemiological and serological studies in HIV-infected Ethiopian immigrants to Israel | doi = 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1994.tb13327.x | journal = Acta Paediatr Suppl | volume = 400 | issue = | pages = 19–21 | pmid = 7833553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bentwich96&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bentwich | first1 = Z. | last2 = Weisman | first2 = Z. | last3 = Moroz | first3 = C. | last4 = Bar-Yehuda | first4 = S. | last5 = Kalinkovich | first5 = A. | year = 1996 | title = Immune dysregulation in Ethiopian immigrants in Israel: relevance to helminth infections? | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2249.1996.d01-612.x | journal = Clinical &amp; Experimental Immunology | volume = 103 | issue = 2| pages = 239–43 | pmid = 8565306 | pmc=2200340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bar-Yehuda97&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bar-Yehuda | first1 = S | last2 = Weisman | first2 = Z | last3 = Kalinkovich | first3 = A | last4 = Vonsover | first4 = A | last5 = Zlotnikov | first5 = S | last6 = Jehuda-Cohen | first6 = T | last7 = Bentwich | first7 = Z | date = Jan 1997 | title = High prevalence of HIV-specific immunity in seronegative Ethiopian immigrants in Israel | url = | journal = AIDS | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 117–18 | pmid = 9110085 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public outcry led to his dismissal of the CEO of MDA and the establishment of a commission of inquiry headed by former Israeli president [[Yitzhak Navon]]. After several months, the committee published its conclusions, calling for a change in policy.  The Committee did not find evidence of racism, although some researchers have contested this.&lt;ref name=Seeman99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaej.co.il/newsite/content.asp?pageid=482 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616054205/http://www.iaej.co.il/newsite/content.asp?pageid=482 |archivedate=June 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3324140,00.html|title=במקום לבכות על הדם - ננקה אותו|date=November 6, 2006|accessdate=August 27, 2017|website=Ynet.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2006, hundreds of Ethiopians clashed with police when protesters attempted to block the entrance to [[Jerusalem]] in the wake of the Israeli Health Ministry's decision to continue the MDA policy of disposing of donations from high risk groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/06/africa/ME_GEN_Israel_Blood_Protest.php|title=Ethiopian-Israelis clash with police, disrupt Jerusalem traffic over discarding of donated blood|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=June 20, 2008|accessdate=2017-08-27|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620044718/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/06/africa/ME_GEN_Israel_Blood_Protest.php|archivedate=June 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, the MDA prohibits the use of blood donations from natives of [[sub-Saharan Africa]], except South Africa, natives of Southeast Asia, natives of the [[Caribbean]] and natives of countries which have been widely affected by the AIDS epidemic, including donations from the natives of Ethiopia. Since 1991 all immigrants from Ethiopia undergo mandatory HIV screenings, regardless of their intention to donate blood.&lt;ref name="Walters88"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walters | first1 = Leroy | year = 1988 | title = Ethical Issues in the Prevention and Treatment of HIV Infection and AIDS | journal = Science | volume = 239 | issue = 4840| pages = 597–603 | doi=10.1126/science.3340846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer88&gt;Gerald M.

===Birth control===
According to a TV program in 2012, female Ethiopian immigrants may have been given the [[Depo-Provera]] birth control drug without full explanation of its effects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nesher|first=Talila|title=Israel admits Ethiopian women were given birth control shots|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-admits-ethiopian-women-were-given-birth-control-shots.premium-1.496519|accessdate=4 February 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Israeli health ministry has instructed all health maintenance organizations not to use the treatment unless patients understand the ramifications. Ethiopian Jewish women awaiting [[aliyah]] were given birth control while in transit camps. The drug has existed for around thirty years but only about five percent of women elect to use this method of birth control in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ethiopian birth control?|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editorials/Article.aspx?id=295373|accessdate=4 February 2013|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of Depo-Provera last for three months.

The practice was first reported in 2010 by ''Isha le'Isha'' (Hebrew: woman to woman), an Israeli women’s rights organization. Hedva Eyal, the report's author, stated: "We believe it is a method of reducing the number of births in a community that is black and mostly poor." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Furore in Israel over birth control drugs for Ethiopian Jews|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/97352/Furore-in-Israel-over-birth-control-drugs-for-Ethiopian-Jews|website=Irinnews.org|accessdate=4 February 2013|date=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haaretz criticized the coverage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ethiopian women and birth control: when a scoop becomes a smear|url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/routine-emergencies/ethiopian-women-and-birth-control-when-a-scoop-becomes-a-smear.premium-1.500341|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleging that there was no plan to deliberately reduce the birth rates of Ethiopian Jews, and there was no evidence of coercion.

==Ethiopian Heritage Museum==
{{Main article|Ethiopian Heritage Museum}}
In 2005, plans were announced for the establishment of a museum in [[Rehovot]] highlighting the culture and heritage of the Ethiopian Beta Israel community. The museum, planned as a research, interpretive and spiritual center, is the initiative of Tomer, an association of veteran Ethiopian immigrants and former [[Mossad]] agents who participated in the first operations to bring Ethiopians to Israel. The museum, expected to cost some $4.5 million, will include a model Ethiopian village, an herb garden, an artificial stream, an amphitheater, classrooms, and a memorial to Ethiopians who died in Sudan on their way to Israel and Ethiopian Zionist activists. The city has set aside 6 dunams (6,000 m²) of land for the museum complex. One of the museum's founders was [[Baruch Tegegne]], who pioneered escape routes from Ethiopia via Sudan and fought for the right of the Beta Israel community to emigrate to Israel. Other founders include veteran Ethiopian rights activist [[Babu Yaakov]], a former member of the Ramle City Council, and Shetu Barehon, who worked in the transit camps in Sudan to bring Ethiopian Beta Israel to Israel.

People of [[Filipinos|Filipino]] descent make up a large and growing part of the State of Hawaii's population. In 2000 they were the third largest ethnic group and represented 22.8% of the population,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mmqx_G9qzScC&amp;pg=PA26 Ethnicity and inequality in Hawaiʻi by Jonathan Y. Okamura]&lt;/ref&gt; but more recent data indicates they have become the largest ethnicity in Hawaii (25.1% in 2010).

The [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] languages are distantly related to each other, being in the [[Malayo-Polynesian]] group of [[Austronesian languages]].

==History==
[[File:Filipino immigrant family in Hawaii, c. 1906.jpg|thumb|Filipino immigrants, c. 1906]]

During the colonial era, the [[Spanish East Indies]], which included the Philippine Islands, were administered as part of [[New Spain]]. It is likely, but not documented, that [[Manila galleon#Possible discovery of Hawaii|people from the Philippines visited the Hawaiian Islands en route to/from Mexico]].

===19th century===
A few Filipinos, known as "Manila men" settled in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] during the 19th century. They mainly worked as cooks and musicians in the [[Royal Hawaiian Band]]. No deliberate migration existed during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/12/11/editorial/special.html Why did Filipinos come to Hawaii? Many were lured by false promises of plantation work By Belinda A. Aquino. ''Honolulu Star-Bulletin''. Vol. 10, Issue 345 - Sunday, December 11, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manila Men ====
The Manila Men were some of the first Filipino overseas workers. They  were the first Filipinos to be documented having come to North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://notablefilipinos.blogspot.com/2014/10/manila-men-first-filipino-overseas.html|title=Notable Filipinos: Manila Men: The First Filipino Overseas Workers|last=Prince|first=James A.|date=2014-10-04|website=Notable Filipinos|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century===
{{see also|Sakadas}}
The importation of Filipino workers for the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s began between 1906 and 1910. By the 1920s Filipinos in Hawaii were still largely male, men outnumbered women by nearly seven to one, and unmarried. They represented, at one point, half of the workers in the sugar industry. Initially the Filipinos tended to be "peasants" of lower education than other groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uEpGow37ChsC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=filipino+hawaii&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LBquTraaEaO2sQKwgaWHDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Filipino piecemeal sugar strike of 1924-1925, Volume 3 by John E.

===Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association===
{{see also|Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association}}
Many Filipino farm laborers were recruited to go to Hawaii in 1906 by the Hawaiian Sugar Planters’ Association (HSPA) to work on the sugar plantations in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/12/11/editorial/special.html|title=StarBulletin.com {{!}} Editorial {{!}} /2005/12/11/|last=Star-Bulletin|first=Honolulu|website=archives.starbulletin.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert F. Judd, an HSPA recruiter tried to get three hundred Filipinos to work in Hawaii. Those Filipinos were sent to the Olaa Plantation on the Big Island of Hawaii&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Little Manila is in the Heart: The Making of the Filipina/o American Community in Stockton|last=Bohulano Mabalon|first=Dawn|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0822353393|location=Durham|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The sugar industry was a booming at the time so the newly annexed countries of Hawai’i and the Philippines were used in concert to support the industry for the United States. 

By the 1920s there was an average of 7,600 Filipinos arriving in Hawaii annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://opmanong.ssc.hawaii.edu/filipino/labor.html|title=Labor Migration in Hawaii|website=opmanong.ssc.hawaii.edu|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Filipinos considered themselves temporary residents in Hawaii until around the 1940s. The HSPA preferred Filipinos to work on sugar plantations because they were known to be hard working and were given the lowest wage of all ethnicities working in the plantation.

===Impact on Hawaii's Working Class===
Some Native Hawaiians worked alongside Filipinos in the sugar plantations. Since the sugar industry in Hawaii was the main source of income for the working class, there was high demand for these jobs. Sugar plantation employers were haole and used racist tactics to divide the plantation laborers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/abicomplete/docview/218828389/CC7C32403944E59PQ/1?accountid=25251|title=Log In - ABI/INFORM Collection - ProQuest|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; American sugar plantation owners weren’t able to get Native Hawaiians to work for them so they relied heavily on the importation of other ethnicities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===After 1965===
The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] allowed more Filipinos to bring family to Hawaii and this allowed more Filipino arrivals, particularly Filipino women, to enter the state. The increase in arrivals also caused some backlash and in the 1970s Filipinos felt discriminated against. They also tended to do more poorly at schools than average in that decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YPoDT624iaUC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=filipino+hawaiian&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BxeuTo63DZL_sQLy6-TyDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=filipino%20hawaiian&amp;f=false People and cultures of Hawaii: a psychocultural profile by John F. McDermott, Wên-Shing Tsêng, Thomas Maretzki, pg 171-181]&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons why Filipino students underperformed in school in the 1970s is unknown, but discrimination may have contributed.  In 1970, of the 93,915 Filipinos living in Hawaii, only 34.4% were high school graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED097184.pdf |title=Population Profiles, Vol. 5: Demographic and Socioeconomic Profiles of the American Indian, Black, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Spanish Heritage, and White Populations of Washington State in 1970. |last1=Shepard |first1=George |date=July 1974 |website=Education Resources Information Center  |publisher=Washington Office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Olympia |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic plurality==
The [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] showed that Filipinos surpassed Japanese as Hawaii’s largest ethnic group. The total population of Filipinos was 342,095 of which 197,497 were full Filipinos, the total population of Japanese was 312,292 of which 185,502 were full Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Census shows Hispanics grow presence in Hawaii |author=Jennifer Sinco Kelleher |url=http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/549652/Census-shows-Hispanics-grow-presence-in-Hawaii.html?nav=5031 |newspaper=[[The Maui News]] |date=21 May 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Population H_Full"&gt;{{cite news |title=Filipinos now second-largest racial group in Hawaii |author=Ben Gutierrez |url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/14926806/filipinos-now-second-largest-population-group-in-hawaii |newspaper=Hawaii News Now |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to surveys conducted by the [[American Community Survey]] showed that Filipinos overtook Japanese between 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilbeat.com/posts/2011/05/24/11156-filipinos-overtake-japanese-as-top-hawaii-group/ ''Filipinos Overtake Japanese As Top Hawaii Group'' by Michael Levine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Flower Power originated in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], as a symbolic action of protest against the Vietnam War. In a November 1965 essay titled ''How to Make a March/Spectacle'', Ginsberg advocated that protesters should be provided with "masses of flowers" to hand out to policemen, press, politicians and spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Allen, "Demonstration or Spectacle as Example, As Communication, or How to Make a March/Spectacle", ''Berkeley Barb'', November 19, 1965, republished in ''The Portable Sixties Reader'', Ann Charles (Ed.), Penguin Classic, 2002, p.208-212 {{ISBN|978-0-14-200194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of props like flowers, toys, flags, candy and music were meant to turn anti-war rallies into a form of [[street theater]] thereby reducing the fear, anger and threat that is inherent within protests.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Shepard,[http://www.journalofaestheticsandprotest.org/1/BenShepard/shepard2.html "Absurd Responses vs. Earnest Politics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703163847/http://www.journalofaestheticsandprotest.org/1/BenShepard/shepard2.html |date=2008-07-03 }}, ''Journal of Aesthetics and Protest'', Volume 1, Issue 2, January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, Ginsberg wanted to counter the "specter" of the [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle gang who supported the war, equated war protesters with communists and had threatened to violently disrupt planned anti-war demonstrations at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Lewis |last=Hyde | title=On the poetry of Allen Ginsberg | publisher=University of Michigan Press | date=January 1, 1985 | page=264 | ISBN=0-472-06353-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Allen | last=Ginsberg | title=Family Business: Selected Letters Between a Father and Son | chapter= |page=241 | publisher=Bloomsbury | date=September 7, 2002 | ISBN=1-58234-216-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Barry | last=Miles | title=Hippie | page=50 | publisher=Sterling  | date=August 28, 2005 | ISBN=1-4027-2873-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Ginsberg's methods, the protest received positive attention and the use of "flower power" became an integral symbol in the counterculture movement.&lt;ref&gt;William Lawlor, ''Beat culture: lifestyles, icons, and impact'', ABC-CLIO (2005), p.126  {{ISBN|1-85109-400-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1966, the Flower Power method of [[guerilla theater]] had spread from California to other parts of the United States. The [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] in New York City staged numerous protests which included handing out balloons and flowers with their anti-war literature.&lt;ref name="Jezer"&gt;{{cite book | first=Marty | last=Jezer | title=Abbie Hoffman: American Rebel | publisher=Rutgers University Press | ISBN=978-0813520179 | page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Workshop in Nonviolence'' (WIN), a magazine published by New York activists, encouraged the use of Flower Power. In May 1967, [[Abbie Hoffman]] organized the Flower Brigade as an official contingent of a New York City parade honoring the soldiers in Vietnam. News coverage captured Flower Brigade participants, who carried flowers, flags and pink posters imprinted with LOVE, being attacked and beaten by bystanders.&lt;ref name="Jezer"/&gt; In response to the violence, Hoffman wrote in WIN magazine, "Plans are being made to mine the East River with daffodils. Dandelion chains are being wrapped around induction centers.... The cry of 'Flower Power' echoes through the land. We shall not wilt."&lt;ref name="Jezer"/&gt;

On the following Sunday in May 1967, WIN activists declared the [[Armed Forces Day]] as "Flower Power Day" and held a rally in [[Central Park]] to counter the traditional parade. Turnout was low and, according to Hoffman, the rally was ineffective because guerilla theater needed to be more confrontational.&lt;ref name="Jezer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Freid, ''The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!: Pageantry and Patriotism in Cold-War America'', Oxford University Press, (1999), p. 141, {{ISBN|0-19-513417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1967, Hoffman and [[Jerry Rubin]] helped organize the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|March on the Pentagon]] using Flower Power concepts to create a theatrical spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Farrell, ''The Spirit of the Sixties: The Making of Postwar Radicalism'', Routledge, 1997, p.223&lt;/ref&gt; The idea included a call for marchers to attempt to levitate the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]. When the marchers faced off against more than 2500 Army national guard troops forming a human barricade in front of the Pentagon, demonstrators held flowers and some placed flowers in the soldier's [[rifle barrel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carlito Rivera, "The 1967 March on the Pentagon and lessons for today" , ''Socialism and Liberation Magazine'', March 2007, retrieved 26-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographs of flower-wielding protesters at the Pentagon March became seminal images of the 1960s anti-war protests. [[The Ultimate Confrontation: The Flower and the Bayonet|An image]] by French photojournalist [[Marc Riboud]] that was printed throughout the world was of seventeen-year-old high school student [[Jan Rose Kasmir]] clasping a daisy and gazing at bayonet-wielding soldiers.

During the 1967 [[Summer of Love]], thousands of hippies gathered there, popularized by [[chart hit|hit]] songs such as "[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]". A July 7, 1967, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story on "The Hippies: Philosophy of a Subculture" and an August [[CBS News]] television report on "The Hippie Temptation",&lt;ref&gt;Harry Reasoner, [http://www.sfsu.edu/~avitv/avcatalog/88444.htm "The Hippie Temptation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319070344/http://www.sfsu.edu/~avitv/avcatalog/88444.htm |date=2006-03-19 }}, ''CBS News'', August 22, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other major media interest, exposed the hippie subculture to national attention and popularized the Flower Power movement across the country and around the world.

The [[avant-garde]] art of [[Milton Glaser]], [[Heinz Edelmann]], and [[Peter Max]] became synonymous with the flower power generation.

Glaser, the founder of [[Push Pin Studios]], also developed the loose psychedelic graphic design, seen for example in his seminal 1966 poster illustration of [[Bob Dylan]] with paisley hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cooperhewitt.org/NDA/WINNERS/2004/LIFETIMEACHIEVEMENT/index.shtml | title=2004 Lifetime Achievement Award | series=National Design Awards | work=Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum | accessdate=2011-03-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215182403/http://cooperhewitt.org/NDA/WINNERS/2004/LIFETIMEACHIEVEMENT/index.shtml | archivedate=2010-12-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the posters by pop artist [[Peter Max]], with their vivid fluid designs painted in [[Day-Glo]] colors, which became visual icons of flower power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Arts &amp; Entertainment Fads | first1=Frank W. | last1=Hoffman | first2=William G. | last2=Bailey | pages= 163–164 | publisher=Haworth Press |date=August 1990 | ISBN=0-86656-881-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Max's cover story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine (September 1969) as well as appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', further established "flower power" style art into mainstream culture.&lt;ref name='ArtofPeterMax'&gt;{{cite book | last = Riley II | first = Charles A. | coauthors = | title = The Art of Peter Max | publisher = Abrams, New York | year = 2002 |edition= 1st | location = | pages = 228–235 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8109-3270-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Goparaju Ramachandra Rao''' ([[nickname]]: '''Gora''')&lt;ref name="Disenchanting India"/&gt; (15 November 1902 – 26 July 1975) was an [[India]]n [[social reformer]], [[atheist]] activist and a participant in the [[Indian independence movement]]. He authored many books on [[atheism]] and proposed atheism as self-confidence. He propagated [[positive atheism]] by his articles, speeches, books and his social work. He is the founder of [[Atheist Centre]] along with his wife [[Saraswathi Gora]] and a few volunteers.

==Early days==

Gora was born on 15 November 1902, into an orthodox [[Telugu Brahmin]] family in [[Chhatrapur]], [[Odisha]], [[India]]. He pursued a botany degree, eventually earning his Master's in [[botany]] at [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College]] in [[Madras]]. He married [[Saraswathi Gora]] in 1922, when she was only 10. He taught botany at various institutes at [[Madurai]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Colombo]] and [[Kakinada]], for fifteen years.&lt;ref name=AtheistMovement&gt;{{cite web|title=Atheist Movement in Andhra Pradesh|url=http://www.atheistcentre.in/pdfs/AtheistMovementInAndhraPradeshIndia.pdf|publisher=[[Atheist Centre]]|accessdate=14 August 2013|author=Dr. G. Vijayam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

Gora started his activism against superstition in the 1920s. He and his wife publicly viewed [[solar eclipse]]s, as there was a superstitious belief that pregnant women should not do so. They stayed in [[haunted house]]s to dispel the myths about such places.&lt;ref name="Atheism and Secularity"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phil Zuckerman|title=Atheism and Secularity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1hbaAHsAlUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA144|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=21 December 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35182-2|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women's Movement"&gt;{{cite book|author=B.

Gora used to run a monthly programme called "cosmopolitan dinners" every full moon night, where people of all castes and religions gathered together.&lt;ref name="Voices of Unbelief"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dale McGowan Ph.D.|title=Voices of Unbelief: Documents from Atheists and Agnostics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzfMJ1Eq_eAC&amp;pg=PT246|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=7 September 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-979-0|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atheism For Dummies"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dale McGowan|title=Atheism For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GJJk_Cjv44UC&amp;pg=PA121|accessdate=12 August 2013|date=25 February 2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-50921-0|pages=132–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gora insisted on staying in a [[Harijan]] locality whenever he was invited to address a village. He also conducted several inter-caste and inter-religious marriages. One of his own sons and daughters married spouses from untouchable castes.&lt;ref name="Atheism and Secularity"/&gt;

In 1933, he was dismissed from the [[PR Government College Kakinada|PR College]] in Kakinada for his atheist views. In 1939, he was dismissed from the [[Sri Venkateswara Hindu College of Engineering, Machilipatnam|Hindu College]] in [[Machilipatnam]] for the same reason.&lt;ref name=AtheistMovement/&gt;

===Atheist Centre===
{{Main article|Atheist Centre}}
In 1940, after his dismissal, he and his wife founded the [[Atheist Centre]], in a small village called Mudunur in the [[Krishna district]].&lt;ref name="Disenchanting India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Good Atheist"/&gt; The Atheist Centre was (and is) heavily involved in social reforms.&lt;ref name="Good Atheist"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Harding|title=How to Be a Good Atheist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujyOk0col-oC&amp;pg=PT44|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=3 February 2012|publisher=Oldcastle Books Ltd|isbn=978-1-84243-685-1|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of Independence in 1947, they moved the Atheist centre to [[Vijayawada]].&lt;ref name="Disenchanting India"/&gt; In 1941, he published his first book on atheism in Telugu, ''Atheism: There is no god'' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]: ''Nasthikatvamu: Devudu ledu'').&lt;ref name=AtheistMovement/&gt;

Throughout the 1940s, he worked in the [[Indian independence movement]]. In 1942, Gora along with his wife and eldest son were arrested during the [[Quit India Movement]]. Their 18-month son had to accompany his mother to the Royavellor jail.&lt;ref name="Women's Movement"/&gt;

Gora and [[Gandhi]] had several discussions, some of which have been recorded in the book ''An Atheist With Gandhi''.&lt;ref name=AtheistMovement/&gt; When Gandhi asked him to differentiate between atheism and godlessness Gora replied, {{Cquote|text=Godlessness is negative. It merely denies the existence of god. Atheism is positive. It asserts the condition that results from the denial of god. Atheism bears a positive significance in the practice of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Gora’ Shri Goparaju Ramachandra Rao (aka Gora) (1902-1975)|url=https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/the-humanist-tradition/20th-century-humanism/gora/|website=British Humanist Association|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Gandhi supported Gora's anti-[[untouchability]] reform movement, and remarked that he wished Gora would succeed in producing a [[Tuskegee]] in India.&lt;ref name="Colored Cosmopolitanism"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nico Slate|title=Colored Cosmopolitanism: The Shared Struggle for Freedom in the United States and India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ZPQsQ7akTIC&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=12 August 2013|date=15 January 2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05967-2|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuskegee in [[Alabama]], [[United States]], is an important site in Africa American history where [[Booker T. Washington]] established the [[Tuskegee University]].

In 1952, he contested in the parliamentary elections to propagate his idea of party-less democracy. In 1967, he also contested in the assembly polls.&lt;ref name="Women's Movement"/&gt;

===World Atheist Conference===
Gora visited several nations in 1970 and 1974.&lt;ref name=AtheistMovement/&gt; He was in touch with the American atheist, [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]].&lt;ref name="Atheism and Secularity"/&gt; On 5 October 1970, O'Hair mentioned Gora and his Atheist Center on her radio show. In 1970, when Gora stopped in United States during his tour, he met O'Hair. They decided that a World Atheist Conference should be held every three years. Gora offered to host the first one in 1972. O'Hair was not able to attend as her visa was not approved in time.&lt;ref name="O'Hair"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan F. Le Beau|title=The Atheist: Madalyn Murray O'Hair|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PitAMz7VfKAC&amp;pg=PA167|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=1 March 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-5172-5|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first World Atheist Conference was held on 1972. After the event, Gora published a book in English called ''Positive Atheism''.&lt;ref name=AtheistMovement/&gt;

===Beef and Pork Party===
Gora first organized Beef and Pork Friendship party in Vijayawada on 15 August 1972, the Silver Jubilee of Indian Independence, there was big commotion and opposition. True to his principles, Gora urged for voluntary participation. Puri Shakaracharya and some orthodox people violently opposed and threatened to disrupt the function. When the matter went up to the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, The government reacted positively and provided police protection. Thousands of people gathered, to witness the beef and pork party. Gora and Saraswathi Gora, who headed the programme, made it clear that it was meant to bring social cohesion. Participants were asked to sign in a register. Among the hundreds of gatherers, 138 people came forward and ate beef and pork together. They included atheists, and even orthodox Hindus, Muslims and Christians. When similar programme was held at Coimbatore, Periyar EV Ramaswami and Gora participated. In various places including Visakhapatnam, Gudivada and Suryapet, Beef and Pork programmes were held.&lt;ref name=AtheistMovement/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atheism and Secularity"/&gt;

==Family==

Gora had nine children.Gora got his eldest daughter, Manorama, married to Arjuna Rao, who belonged to the [[Dalit]] community In 1949.&lt;ref name="Women's Movement"/&gt; The marriage was held in [[Sevagram]], in presence of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].the marriage of his eldest son, Lavanam, with Hemalata, the daughter of [[Gurram Jashuva]], was also held in Sevagram In 1960.&lt;ref name=AtheistMovement/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Atheist varsity, research centre to open in Vijayawada|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2487992.ece|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=26 September 2011|author=Ramesh Susarla}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His eldest son was an atheist and Gandhian [[Lavanam]], daughter Mythri and another son Vijayam, continued to organise the World Atheist Conference. Mythri chairperson of Atheist Centre and Vijayam is the current executive director of the Atheist Centre. The physician Samaram Ramachandra Rao is his son.&lt;ref name="Disenchanting India"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Quack|title=Disenchanting India: Organized Rationalism and Criticism of Religion in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNbxUwhS5RUC&amp;pg=PA338|accessdate=12 August 2013|date=22 November 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-981260-8|pages=89, 338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His daughter, [[Chennupati Vidya]], is a social worker. She was elected to the [[Lok Sabha]], of the [[Parliament of India]], in 1980&lt;ref name="Women 7th Lok Sabha"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Members of Seventh Lok Sabha|url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/lok07/women/07women.htm|publisher=National Informatics Complex|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1989.&lt;ref name="Women 9th Lok Sabha"&gt;{{cite web|title=Members Of Ninth Lok Sabha|url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/lok09/alpha/09lsc.htm|publisher=National Informatics Complex|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views and philosophy==
Gora supported partyless [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="Atheism and Secularity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="States Politics in India"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sadhna Sharma|title=States Politics in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i0HdDbdKa8UC&amp;pg=PA503|accessdate=12 August 2013|year=1995|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-619-4|page=503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gora was a [[Gandhian]] and believed in [[Sarvodaya]] (progress of all). He rejected [[historical materialism]] and considered [[Marxism]] a 'fatalist philosophy'.&lt;ref name="Kovoor"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Abraham Kovoor|Dr. Abraham Kovoor]]|title=Gods, Demons &amp; Spirits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5es1-ikfBwC&amp;pg=PT7|accessdate=12 August 2013|date=1 March 2000|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7224-216-9|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He believed that atheism allows a person to surpass the barriers of castes and religions. It allows a person to understand that his/her actions are directed by free will and not [[Karma]],&lt;ref name="Voices of Unbelief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quotable Atheist"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Huberman|title=Quotable Atheist: Ammunition for Nonbelievers, Political Junkies, Gadflies, and Those Generally Hell-Bound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5GGBuLZJoEC&amp;pg=PA132|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=3 March 2008|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-1-56858-419-5|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; fate or divine will. This in turn would allow Harijans to be liberated, as they would no longer believe that they are fated to be untouchable.&lt;ref name="Voices of Unbelief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atheism For Dummies"/&gt;

==Death==
Gora died on 26 July 1975 in Vijayawada. His autobiography, completed a few days before his death, was published in 1976.&lt;ref name=AtheistMovement/&gt; The Atheist Centre continued under the guidance of Saraswathi Gora, until her death in 2006 on 19 August.&lt;ref name="WifeDeath"&gt;{{cite news|title=Saraswathi Gora passes away|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/08/20/stories/2006082015870900.htm|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=20 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

In 2002, [[India Post]], the postal department of the [[Government of India]], released a [[postage stamp]] of five [[Indian Rupee|rupee]] denomination commemorating Gora's birth [[centenary]].&lt;ref name="Disenchanting India"/&gt;

'''HelpAge Canada''' is a non-denominational, non-profit charity in Canada dedicated to assisting impoverished older persons living in [[Canada]] and the developing world. HelpAge Canada was previously known as Help the Aged (Canada) until Fall 2010.

HelpAge Canada offers programs for impoverished older persons in eleven developing countries worldwide. 
Programs focus on primary health care, agro-forestry, food aid, emergency assistance, capacity building, training and sponsorship. 
All of HelpAge Canada's overseas programs are coordinated through local charitable organizations such as the Oblate missionaries, SOFEPADI, Ahero Joot Social Services, [[the Salvation Army]] and the [[St. Vincent de Paul Society]]. 
They work in collaboration with other national and international nongovernmental organizations.

HelpAge Canada obtains its funding from Federal and Provincial government sources, corporations and foundations, and individual donors to support their programs. Primary Government sources include Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). 
Over 50% of their funding is raised through general donations and donations in-kind. Government income is used to supplement general donations. Administration costs were 2.7% in 2009-10, fund-raising costs were 6.2%.

HelpAge Canada is governed by an elected volunteer Board of Directors. The Board also appoints Management Committees to advise the Executive Director, who is hired by the Board of Directors. 
The charity receives support and professional expertise through its affiliate membership with HelpAge International and through its membership with organizations such as the Alberta Wild Rose Foundation.

Among the many issues tackled by HelpAge Canada are:
* [[Poverty]] among older people.
* [[Loneliness|Isolation]] and loneliness.
* [[International Development]]
* [[Microcredit]]
* [[Ageism]] Prevention
* [[Neglect]] Prevention

'''Hoava''' is an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] spoken by 1000–1500 people on [[New Georgia Island]], [[Solomon Islands]].  Speakers of Hoava are multilingual and usually also speak [[Roviana language|Roviana]], Marovo, SI Pijin, English.

==Introduction==

===History===
Hoava is an [[Austronesian]] language that is spoken mostly on the island of [[New Georgia]]. [[New Georgia]] is a mountainous island, 85 kilometres long and 41 kilometres wide at its widest part, with a total area of 2,145 square kilometres, covered with dense rainforests (Davis 2003). The island of New Georgia was involved in WWII that was later named the [[New Georgia Campaign]] which lasted from June 20 to November 3.

===Population===
Hoava is an [[Austronesian]] language that is spoken in 3 known locations: [[Western Province (Solomon Islands)|Western Province]], [[New Georgia]] island, [[North Marovo lagoon]], but mainly New Georgia island of the Solomon Islands. According to a 1986 census there are about 2,360 speakers of the language, but language is spoken by 460 people in latest census that was taken in 1999 suggesting a huge drop off in the number of speakers.

==Sounds==

===Consonants===
Hoava uses 16 consonants in its [[phoneme]] system, /p, t, b, d, s, β, m, n, r, l, dʒ, k, g, ɣ, ŋ, h/.

===Vowels===
Hoava uses 5 vowels: /i, ɛ, a, ɔ, u/. There is no [[phonemic distinction]] of vowel length, although vowels can be lengthened when stressed (Davis 2003).  The vowels can be combined into pairs with the weight of two syllables (Davis 2003).

===Syllable Structure===
Hoava has an [[open syllable structure]] of (C)V. Two vowels occurring together are counted as two syllables, since they function as such for transitive marking rules (Davis 2003). For many Oceanic languages of the [[Austronesian]] family group it is common that words do not end in consonant..

==Grammar==

===Basic Word Order===
In traditional typology Hoava is a [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]] language. There are some modifications to this particular pattern for focusing and [[topicalization]] purposes (Davis 2003).

===Reduplication===
[[Reduplication]] is frequently used in Hoava as a method of word formation, to express intensification, and to form the progressive aspect of a verb (Davis 2003). [[Reduplication]] is used to create words denoting entities related to the referent of the source word, either as part of the entity, or having a resemblance to it, or being a metaphorical extension"(Davis 2003). 
*’’bui’’, lost; ‘’bu-bui’’, forgot
*’’yasa’’, jump; ‘’yasa-yasa’’, jumping

===Numerals===
Hoava has a [[Decimal|decimal system]] of numbering”(Davis 2003). 
*’’keke’’  one 
*’’karua’’  two 
*’’hike’’  three 
*’’made’’  four 
*’’lima’’  five 
*’’onomo’’  six 
*’’zuapa’’  seven 
*’’vesu’’  eight 
*’’sia’’  nine 
*’’manege’’  ten

=== Pronouns ===

==== Personal pronouns ====
Information in the following sections is based on Davis 2003:45-109,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A grammar of the Hoava language, Western Solomons|last=Davis|first=Karen|publisher=Canberra : Pacific Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University.|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=45–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless otherwise stated. Subsequent references give only relevant page numbers and figures.

Within the Language Hoava there exists three sets of characteristics in order to distinguish between which [[personal pronoun]] is to be used. This includes whether the pronoun is; first, second or third person. The Plurality needed, whether it is singular or plural and whether it is Inclusion or exclusion. 
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|Third
|'''i(sa)'''
|'''ria'''
|}
&lt;sup&gt;(pg 46, Figure 63)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are a number of extra circumstances and exceptions which are also present when discussing the use of personal pronouns. One specific example of this is the third person singular form '''isa''' which is used as an emphatic (forcible) form or used to refer to a particular topic. Speakers of Hoava tend to use '''sa''' for a more general pronoun.

The third person pronoun '''eri''' is used with a dual form created by using the number two ‘'''karu'''’ after a plural pronoun. A trial form is also created by using the number three prefix ‘ka-hike’. The dual forms are obligatory whereas trial forms can be replaced by a simple plural.

Forms specific for four people are common when it is significant to know that four people were involved. The number four follows the pronoun with the number prefix added e.g. '''gita ka-made, gami ka-made'''. Other numbers can be substituted into a sentence in the same matter. When these dual or numerical forms are used, it is most commonly at the start of a narrative to add the names of the others in the group. This does not include the speaker themselves. These pronoun forms can come before a noun phrase in [[apposition]].

Examples:

'''Sagele             pale                 mae     eri                    karu'''

Go.up              return               come    PRO:3PL         two

‘They (two) came back up.’

&lt;sup&gt;(Pg 47, Figure 68)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some other characteristics to note with the use of pronouns in Hoava is that pronouns can be followed by [[demonstrative]]s and by the restrictive particle '''qa,''' an example of this can be seen below.

There exist some cases in Hoava in which it is not completely necessary for a pronoun to be present or where exceptions to the use of pronouns exist. Firstly; It is common for the pronoun to be dropped from a sentence completely once it has been made clear who is being referred to, or if it is clear who is being referred to by other information such as object markers. Also, the dropping of pronouns referring to animate objects is predominantly done with first person singular and plural and second person plural pronouns in object position, as the object marker on the verb is the same as the pronoun.

Inanimate objects in Hoava do not often have a [[Pronoun|pronominal]] reference; a construction which resembles a pronoun to identify the object. However, it is possible to use a pronoun for an inanimate object even though it is rare.

Within Hoava Language there exists no [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] forms of the pronouns. In order to create the same meaning as a reflexive the verb '''pule''' (meaning return) is used. “There is no subject or object pronoun used, other than the object marker on the applicative suffix…in any of the sentences elicited with the pule used in this manner.” (pg.49) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Vaquru            teqe     pule-ni-rao                 qa'''

New                cut       return-AP-1SG             REST

‘I’ve just cut myself.’

&lt;sup&gt;(Pg 49, Figure 78b)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As you can see in the example above '''pule''' has been used with the applicable [[suffix]] and the singular, exclusive first person, pronoun '''rao,''' to create the meaning of the reflexive form ‘I’ve’. Also, the pronoun is followed by the restrictive particle '''qa''' which is a characteristic that was mentioned earlier to sometimes occur with the use of pronouns.

The morpheme '''tale-''' can also be used in the instances mentioned above but rather than performing a reflexive function it acts as an emphasis that no other people were involved apart from the speaker.

'''Vaquru           teqe                 pulu-ni-a                     tale-na.'''

New                cut                   return-AP-3SG            alone-3SG

‘(She) has just cut herself.’

&lt;sup&gt;(Pg. 49, Figure 79)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Within the [[lexicon]] of Hoava there exists some verbs which have an inherent reflexive meaning built into them and so therefore the use of an extra form which suggests that it is reflexive is not needed. These are verbs which automatically mean performing an action to oneself such as; '''hele''' ‘wash oneself’ or '''viraka''' ‘scratch (oneself)’

==== Demonstrative pronouns ====
In Hoava there exists a three-way spatial differentiation of [[deixis]]. This includes: proximal, close to the speaker; distal, close to the hearer; and remote, distant for the speaker and the hearer. Of the three sets of demonstratives in Hoava two sets concern the use of pronouns. A set of long forms that are used as both noun modifiers and as demonstrative pronouns and another set which is restricted to being used only as demonstrative pronouns. An extra set of ‘near to hearer’ long demonstratives is also used both as a noun modifier and demonstrative pronoun. These sets all have both singular and plural forms which can be used. 
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|Distant
|'''hunai'''
|'''huari'''
|remote
|}
&lt;sup&gt;(Pg. 81)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These long demonstratives can act as demonstrative pronouns at the beginning of a noun phrase.

An example of the use of long demonstratives is as follows:

'''Heri                 ria                    nikana             vihe.'''

PROX:PL          ART:PL             man                 choose

‘These are the chosen men.’

&lt;sup&gt;(pg.85, figure 204d)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is more common in Hoava for the [[morpheme]]s '''isana''' and '''tiara''' to be used in place as demonstrative pronouns in favour of the singular distal demonstratives '''sani''' and the plural '''sari.''' It is also not common for the remote demonstratives '''Huani''' and '''Huari''' to be used.

Hoava has a set of short demonstratives, which are a group of particles found after the noun head of a noun phrase. They have the noun modifying function of adding a sense of definiteness and they may also signify tense. They can be used with common nouns, names, and pronouns. 
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|Remote/past
|'''so'''
|'''ro'''
|}
&lt;sup&gt;(Pg 87. Figure 212)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For example, a short demonstrative follows a personal pronoun:

'''Kolo,                na        sa        taveti-a           gamu               na?'''

Friend              ART     what    do.TR-3SG       POR:2PL          DEM

‘Friend, what are you doing?’

&lt;sup&gt;(pg.87, figure 213c)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The long demonstratives mentioned above cannot occur after the emphatic particles '''ba''' and '''ga''' as another set of emphatic demonstrative pronouns exist for that case. This other set is used also in questions or as an alternative to the long forms.

&lt;sup&gt;(Pg. 93, Figure 232)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For example:

ART     what    PRO:SG           ART     lime     EMPH  DIST:SG

‘What is this?’ ‘That’s lime!’

&lt;sup&gt;(pg.94. figure 237b)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Possessive pronouns ====
Hoava has a set of possessive pronouns which are used at the head of a noun phrase before the item which is being possessed. They are used in cases of exclusive possession.

&lt;sup&gt;(Pg. 104, Figure 263)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For example:

'''Mami              gugasu'''

POSS:1PL.EX    village

‘our village’

'''Na        dia                  sanu    koe-di'''

ART     POSS:3PL         thing    old-3PL

‘Their old things’

&lt;sup&gt;(Pg. 104. Figure 264 a and c)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Person Marking ===
Hoava has two optional articles '''E''' and '''se''' which, may or may not be used with personal names or personified animals and birds. These articles are used before the name and although '''Se''' is more likely to be used over '''E''' neither example is completely necessary and can be dropped.

Example:

'''Samu   Gobe   misianare        tami                gami'''

S.         G.        teacher            POSS:1PL.EX    PRO:1PL.EX

‘Our teacher was Samu Gobe.’

&lt;sup&gt;(Pg. 59, Figure114b)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Vocabulary==

===Indigenous Vocabulary===
*’’hore’’  canoe 
*’’leboto’’  bushknife 
*’’igana’’  fish 
*’’inebara’’  feast 
*’’pirae’’  now 
*’’tavete’’  make 
*’’keke’’  one 
*’’mae’’  come 
*’’toka’’  follow 
*’’puta’’  sleep 
*’’gua’’  did 
*’’heleana’’  river 
*’’ko’’  be 
*’’tala’’ “where 
*’’la’’  go 
*’’koburu’’  child 
*’’ome’’  see

==Endangerment==

===Materials===
There are not many materials written in Hoava. The only material of outside world access is a guide to grammar by Karen Davis and a storybook. With it only beginning to fall out of use. There are translations of the bible and stories but not much else is known about surviving materials.

===Vitality===
According to [[Ethnologue]], Hoava has a 6b (Yellow) endangerment status. “Intergenerational transmission is in the process of being broken, but the childbearing generation can still use the language so it is possible that revitalization efforts could restore transmission of the language in the home”(Lewis 2013).Without intergenerational transfer, main outlet uses will soon be destroyed or fade away while other languages take its place. With the decrease of L1 speakers, the value of the language in the community will only drop, till it is no longer applicable to the community. Combined with the low number of speakers, if no action is to take place, Hoava will fade to away into disuse.

The '''International Organization of Turkic Culture''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Uluslararası Türk Kültürü Teşkilatı'', '''Türksoy''') is an international [[Culture|cultural]] organization of countries with [[Turkic peoples|Turkic populations]], speaking languages belonging to the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]]. Other than being an abbreviation of the former official name "''Türk Kültür ve Sanatları Ortak Yönetimi''" - Joint Administration of Turkic Culture and Arts, "'''Türksoy'''" is a compound noun, in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], made up of the words "'''Türk'''" (Turk/ic) and "'''soy'''" (ancestry).

The General Secretary of Türksoy is [[Duisen Kaseinov]], former Minister of Culture of [[Kazakhstan]]. Türksoy has its headquarters in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]].

== History ==
The organization has its roots in meetings during 1992 in [[Baku]] and [[Istanbul]], where the ministers of culture from [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkey]], and [[Turkmenistan]] declared their commitment to cooperate in a joint cultural framework. Türksoy was subsequently established by an agreement signed on July 12, 1993 in [[Almaty]].

In 1996, an official cooperation between Türksoy and [[UNESCO]] was established, involving mutual consultations and reciprocal representation.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO Web Site|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001035/103511E.pdf|title=Relations with the Joint Administration of the Turkic Culture and Arts (TÜRKSOY), and Draft Agreement between that Organization and UNESCO|accessdate=2009-12-04|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is announced that Türksoy will be integrated into the [[Turkic Council]], a geopolitical organization of Turkic countries established on November 3, 2009.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

== Members ==

As of 2016, Türksoy has six sovereign member states and three non-sovereign observer states.&lt;ref name="Members"/&gt;

'''Italian Scots''' or '''Scots-Italians''' are people of [[Italian people|Italian]] descent living in [[Scotland]]. These terms may refer to people who are born in Scotland and of Italian descent. It can also refer to people of mixed Scottish and Italian ancestry. A recent Italian voter census estimated that there are 70,000 to 100,000 people in Scotland of Italian descent or Italian nationals, which is up to 1.9% of the overall Scottish population.

Latest available figures from the [[2011 UK Census]] show there were 6,048 people born in Italy living in Scotland. This was up from 4,936 in 2001 and 3,947 recorded in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/what-impact-have-scots-italians-had-on-scotland-1-4025475|title=What impact have Scots-Italians had on Scotland?|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Ronnie Convery, secretary of the Italian Scotland charitable organisation and director of communications at the [[Archdiocese of Glasgow]], asserted that a completely new dimension was being added to the Scots-Italians community. He said, “There has been a brand new migration over the past two years, and the biggest one we have seen in 100 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/what-impact-have-scots-italians-had-on-scotland-1-4025475|title=What impact have Scots-Italians had on Scotland?|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority come from the provinces of [[Province of Lucca|Lucca]], [[Province of Parma|Parma]], [[Province of Frosinone|Frosinone]] and [[Province of Isernia|Isernia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==History==
Arguably the first people from [[Italy]] to reach Scotland were the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in and around 40CE, although the modern nation of Italy did not exist at the time and of course the Roman Empire was a cosmopolitan institution, with some [[Roman Emperors]] from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[North Africa]]. Still, the Romans were for the most part from what is now Italy and they did leave their mark on Scotland in the shape of [[Hadrian's Wall]], [[Antonine Wall]] and other monumental constructions, although it was not until the end of the 19th century that an Italian-Scots identity really began to take shape.

Many Italian-Scots can trace their ancestry back to the 1890s where their forefathers escaped [[drought]], [[famine]] and [[poverty]] in their homeland for a better life in Scotland; yet it was not until [[World War I]] that a sizeable population of Italian-Scots—over 4,000&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3976689.stm| title=Italian role in Scotland honoured|  publisher=BBC News| date=3 November 2004| accessdate=2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;—began to emerge, with [[Glasgow]] hosting the third largest community in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Since then, there has been a steady flow of [[Human migration|migration]] between the two countries.

Italy and the [[fascist]] involvement in [[World War II]] brought many hardships on Italians settled in Scotland - many families were separated as adult males were [[interned]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scotsitalian.com/history.htm| title=History| publisher=ScotsItalian.com| accessdate=2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family members that were left behind were forced to cope with mistrust and [[discrimination]]. Of those imprisoned many men found themselves held in [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. A number of others were employed in [[Orkney]], at [[Scapa Flow]], to construct a barrier against [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[U-boats]]. These men additionally constructed the [[Italian Chapel|Chapel of Lambholm]] from scrap metal and junk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/heritage/scotland/highland/article_1.shtml| title=Orkney's Italian Gift| publisher=BBC| accessdate=2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, this Chapel is one of Orkney's most popular tourist attractions.

Today, Italian Scots can be found working in all manner of [[profession]]s. However, a large proportion of the community have plied their trade in the [[catering]] industry, working in the [[fish and chips|chip shops]], [[ice-cream]] parlours, [[pizzeria]]s and [[restaurants]] across Scotland.

In Edinburgh,The Italo-Scottish Research Cluster (ISRC) aims to study Italian immigration in Scotland and promote relations between Scotland and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ed.ac.uk/literatures-languages-cultures/delc/italian/italo-scottish-research-cluster/about|title=About us|work=The University of Edinburgh|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuteb''' (Also known as ''Kutep'' or ''Ati'') is a [[Jukunoid language]] of [[Nigeria]], spoken by the [[Kuteb people]], with a thousand-or-so speakers across the border in [[Cameroon]].

== Phonology ==
In Kuteb, there are 27 consonant phonemes, 12 vowels , and five tones.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Blench, Roger. [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/BC/Jukunoid/Kuteb%20grammar%20for%20KWEF%20ed%20RMB%20December%202007.doc ''Kuteb grammar'']. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===
In Kuteb, there are two different sets of vowels, oral, and nasal. Phonemically, each set has six different [[vowel]]s. In total, there are 12 separate phonemes. The status of ''ɨ'' being a phoneme in Kuteb is uncertain. This phoneme only occurs in closed syllables, some noun prefixes, and in verbal reduplication where there is neutralization of ''u'' and ''i''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Consonants ===
Kuteb has 27 different [[consonant]] phonemes. The italicized entries are found in common loan words, or, in the case of /v/ and /z/, subdialectical variation. Like most [[Jukunoid languages]], Kuteb has velarized consonants. In one study, these are included not as modifications on the base-phoneme, but as their own separate sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Jukunoid|last=Kiyoshi|first=Shimizu|publisher=Veröffentlichungen des Instituts für Afrikanistik und Ägyptlogie der Universität Wien|year=1980|isbn=|location=Vienna, Austria|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger.

=== Tones ===
In Kuteb, there are either four or five different tones, depending on how they are counted. The tones that are accepted by multiple studies are the low (unmarked), mid (¯), high (´), and falling (ˆ) tones.

==== Arguments ====
According to [[Roger Blench]], there are five different tones in Kuteb, these are: low (unmarked), mid (¯), high (´),  falling (ˆ), and rising (ˇ). The fifth tone, (rising) is only created through sandhi changes that affect some vocabulary after an "upstep".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to W.E. Welmers, this sandhi change does not occur, and if it did, only the pronunciation would change, not the written diacritic as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Phonology and Morphology of Kuteb ''(unpublished)''|last=Welmers|first=W.E.|publisher=Sudan United Mission|year=1948|isbn=|location=|pages=105 &amp; 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phonotactics ===

==== Syllabic boundaries ====
In Kutep, like in other Jukunoid languages, most consonantal phonemes can either be [[Labialization|labialized]] or [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatal]]. If these changes are taken to be consonantal phonemic clusters, the syllabic boundaries are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger.

==== Sandhi changes ====
The letter ⟨w⟩ in the Kuteb language retains its status as a [[voiced labio-velar approximant]], as in ''uwé'' ‘face’ or in ''wōm'' ‘dry’ - though, when ⟨w⟩ is included in clusters with a palatal consonant (/c, j, sh, nj/) /w/, due to sandhi changes, becomes a voiced or voiceless labiodental release.

==== Distribution of consonants ====
In Kuteb, there are many consonant clusters that can exist, though, most of these occur between word boundaries, though, some of these do occur in single-syllable isolation - these syllables are listed below. Theoretically though, any combination of syllable-final consonants (see below) followed by any syllable-initial consonant is possible. It is likely, however, that reduction would occur, as in the word ''ushitong'' ‘soup-stirrer’ (from ''shir'' and ''utoŋ'') in which the /r/ has been dropped. Also, when final ⟨nn⟩ &lt;ref name=":0" group="note" /&gt; stems precede stems beginning with ⟨n⟩, the double ⟨nn⟩+⟨n⟩ is reduced to just ⟨n⟩. This effect can be shown in words such as ''munae'' (munn-náe) ‘be abundant’, and in ''munji'' (munn-nji) ‘forget’.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Blench, Roger. [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/BC/Jukunoid/Kuteb%20grammar%20for%20KWEF%20ed%20RMB%20December%202007.doc ''Kuteb grammar'']. p. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

In CV positions, the following consonants are used:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* p ts t c k   b (d) (g)    mb nd nj ŋg    f s sh h   v z   nz     m n ŋ   r l
While in C(C)VC final positions, the following are used instead:
* b r g m n* ŋ'''*'''
And the following are used in CC clusters:
* ''With Cw'': pw, mbw, bw, fw, mw, sw (?), cw, njw, jw, shw, kw, ngw, and ŋw &lt;ref group="note"&gt;Roger Blench notes that ⟨[[Eng (letter)|ŋ]]⟩ and ⟨ng⟩ are equivalent in the standard orthography. Here, both ⟨ŋw⟩ and ⟨ngw⟩ are listed as separate phonemes, though, the difference between them is not given&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''With Cy'': py, mby
* ''With Ck'': pk, tk, fk, sk
* ''With Cg'': mbg, ndg

==== Consonant clusters ====
In 1964, Peter Ladefoged recorded the phonetics of multiple West African languages. One of these languages was Kuteb, and these were his findings:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A phonetic study of west African languages|last=Ladefoged|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge University|year=1964|isbn=0-521-06963-7|location=Cambridge|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of blood donation agencies in the United States}}

The United States does not have a centralized blood donation service.  The [[American Red Cross]] collects a little less than half of the blood used, the other half is collected by independent agencies, most of which are members of [[America's Blood Centers]].  The US military collects blood from service members for its own use, but also draws blood from the civilian supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryblood.dod.mil/ |title=Armed Services Blood Program: The Official Program for Blood Donation and Collection for the Armed Services |publisher=Militaryblood.dod.mil |date= |accessdate=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LiveLeak''' is a [[Video hosting service|video sharing]] website located in London, United Kingdom that lets users post and share videos.

== Controversy ==
[[File:US pilot mock-sings as missile hits target.theora.ogv|thumb|left|Cockpit video showing a [[Hellfire missile]] being fired at two targets in [[Afghanistan]].]]

Featured videos often involve graphic content of fatal accidents or shootings. Although by 2016, Liveleak had reduced its controversial content, the site frequently sparked up controversy up until around 2008, mostly due to its graphic and political content. The site came to prominence in 2007 following the unauthorised filming and leaking of the [[execution of Saddam Hussein]], and was referred to by [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Tony Snow]] and then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House Press Secretary, Tony Snow, plugs LiveLeak|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=829607785c|publisher=liveleak.com|accessdate=23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Blair Plugs LiveLeak|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=73d671978f|publisher=liveleak.com|accessdate=23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 2007, the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' broadcast a show about how young people were getting physically assaulted and knocked unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panorama: Children's Fight Club|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/07_july/29/fight.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Panorama'' queried the "extremely violent videos" that had been posted to LiveLeak's website, co-founder Hayden Hewitt refused to take them down, stating, "Look all this is happening, this is real life, this is going on, we're going to show it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Web child fight videos criticised|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6920817.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 March 2008 | date=29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; LiveLeak states there are relatively few such videos on the site and should the uploaders be found to have participated in the violent attack or filmed it themselves, it would aid the police with any prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hayden Hewitts Response After the Panorama Show|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=ca4_1186119784|publisher=liveleak.com|accessdate=23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LiveLeak was again in the spotlight in March 2008, when it hosted the anti-[[Quran]] film ''[[Fitna (film)|Fitna]]'' made by Dutch politician [[Geert Wilders]]. LiveLeak holds to being strictly non-biased in its approach to members and their content, believing in freedom of speech within the site rules, regardless of how certain content might offend them personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LiveLeak, bias, and the eternal quest for personal accountability |url=http://forums.liveleak.com/blog.php?b=16 |publisher=liveleak.com |accessdate=23 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401001445/http://forums.liveleak.com/blog.php?b=16 |archivedate=1 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fitna'' was taken down after threats were made against LiveLeak staff, but was back online on 30 March 2008 after LiveLeak reportedly improved security. The video was once again removed two days later on 1 April; this time it was removed by the user citing that it was taken down due to copyright wrangles and a new version would be uploaded "soon."

A video of US journalist [[James Foley (photojournalist)|James Foley]] was posted by Islamist fighters on YouTube before, as reported by ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'', "YouTube deleted it and demand for the LiveLeak version soared."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LiveLeak Bans Islamic State Beheading Videos After James Foley Murder |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/22/liveleak-bans-islamic-state-beheading-videos-after-james-foley-murder |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |accessdate=22 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824115448/http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/22/liveleak-bans-islamic-state-beheading-videos-after-james-foley-murder |archivedate=24 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to that video the leadership of the website declared that they would not host any "further beheadings carried out by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|IS]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a69_1408615973 |website= ''LiveLeak.com'' |title= Statement From Liveleak Regarding IS Beheading Videos which might be upcoming|date=21 August 2014|accessdate= 28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt; The website will continue to host the original video that depicts the aftermath of Foley's execution.

==Features==
"YourSay" is a section of the website where users upload their own videos, much like a [[vlog]]. Unlike YouTube, the vlogs on LiveLeak are more political and are known for debate.

LiveLeak currently has multiple categories including [[Syria]] and [[Ukraine]], in which graphic content regarding various conflicts can be viewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LiveLeak|url=http://www.liveleak.com/|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==
On 24 March 2014, LiveLeak and [[Ruptly]] announced a content partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prlog.org/12299623-ruptly-video-news-agency-and-liveleakcom-announce-content-partnership.html|title=Ruptly Video News Agency and LiveLeak.com announce content partnership|author=Ruptly|work=''prlog.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Makury''', or '''Makury Naga''' (sometimes mistakenly spelled '''Makuri'''), is a [[Naga language]] of India and Burma. Shi (2009:3) and Saul (2005:25) suggest that Makury may be an [[Ao languages|Ao]] language.

==Classification==
Makury is not close to other Naga languages that fall under Konyak-[Tangshang] and Angami-Zeme. Makury falls under Ao-Tangkhul linguistic group of southern Naga languages and is close to Naga languages that fall under the said language group. Müvlë (Longphuri) are a sub-tribe of Makury. In Eastern Nagaland, Myanmar, Makury, Somra Tangkhul and Para are closer than the other tribes in the north in terms of language (''Makury Tribal Council'').

==Geographical distribution==
Makury is spoken in [[Leshi Township]], [[Homalin Township]], and [[Lahe Township]] in [[Hkamti District]], [[Sagaing Region]], [[Myanmar]]. There are about 40,000 speakers in Myanmar, and about 25,000 in India.

==Dialects==
''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists the following dialects of Makury.

*Mëkheotlë
*Sengphüvlë
*Aralë
*Jilë

Jongphüvlë (listed as ''Kyaungphuri'' in Ethnologue) is a Makury clan name (''Makury Tribal Council'').

Shi (2009:5) lists the following dialects of Makury.
*Phuvle, Makheotle
*Sengphuvle, Muvle, Jeile

'''Mary Howgill''' (1623 – before 1681) was a prominent early member of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) in [[England]]. She is best known for her public defense of Quakers in a 1656 letter to Oliver Cromwell.&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Howgill|title=A Remarkable Letter of Mary Howgill to Oliver Cromwell, Called Protector|year=1656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="broadview"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Broadview Anthology of Seventeenth-Century Prose |editor=Alan Rudrum |editor2=Joseph Black |editor3=Holly Faith Nelson |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2001 |page=535}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Visionary Women|author=Phyllis Mack|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|isbn=0-520-07845-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She delivered the letter in person and subsequently had a long discourse with Cromwell. She began the letter:

{{Quote|text=When thou wast a soldier for the Lord, thou wast low, and little in thine own eyes; then thou remembredst the Lord, and stood in his fear, and he was thy strength; but now thou art in thy own strength, and hast forgot that time: I say, thou hast denied the Lord God, and thy own law with the pride of thy own heart; and the pride of the heart is now acting all manner of cruelty against them who are in the fear of the Lord|author=Mary Howgill|source=&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt;}}

The letter was written during a time of religious persecution, and challenges political and religious authorities that punished statements of religious conscience with confiscation of property, physical violence, and imprisonment.&lt;ref name="broadview"/&gt;

==Life==
She was probably the sister of [[Francis Howgill]] of Grayrigg, Westmoreland.  Both wrote letters to Cromwell and both were imprisoned as a result.  She had been imprisoned earlier for public preaching of Quaker doctrines in Kendal in 1653.&lt;ref name="broadview"/&gt;

She wrote a second pamphlet, "The Vision of the Lord of Hosts".&lt;ref name="vision"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mary Howgill Warning the People of England, 1660|url=https://hitchhikeamerica.wordpress.com/2013/02/02/mary-howgill-warning-the-people-of-england-1660/|accessdate=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallvworthington.com/Validity.html#Mary|title=Mary Howgill|accessdate=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pamphlet was written after King Charles II was returned to the throne, and described a dream in which her God tells her of the terrible persecutions of Quakers about to happen:

{{Quote|text=I will allow this violence to come, and the chains of the wild-beasts to be broken, that they may bow down a stiff-necked and a gain-saying [opposing] people, against me, and against my name. I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that I may show my power upon every man and woman; and I will suffer the violent to go on in their violence, for the trying of the faith of my own people, unto whom I have made known my Kingdom, and entrusted them with my secrets, upon whom in the Light of my countenance will I shine, and they shall see the glory of my throne, and they shall magnify my name. And after the night of Apostasy, and after the dragon's rage, my people shall bear a further testimony of my great and glorious name, and they shall leave a more clear and heavenly declaration upon record, than my servants heretofore have done, and it shall stand to ages, and in generations to come, that they may see how God manifested himself unto his people in a day of great suffering.|author=Mary Howgill|&lt;ref name="vision"/&gt;}}

'''Moroccans''' ({{Lang-ar|المغاربة}} ''al-Maġāriba'', [[Berber languages|Berber]]: {{lang|ber|ⵉⵎⵖⵕⴰⴱⵉⵢⵏ}} ''Imɣṛabiyen'') are a [[Maghrebis|Maghrebi]] ethnic group inhabiting or originating from [[Morocco]] that share a common [[Culture of Morocco|Moroccan culture]] and [[Maghrebis|Maghrebi]] ancestry. The overwhelming majority of Moroccans are of [[Arab-Berber]] descent;&lt;ref name="Bhatia"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Tej K. Bhatia, William C.

In addition to the 36 million Moroccans in [[Morocco]], there is a large [[Moroccan diaspora]] in [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], the [[Moroccan-Dutch|Netherlands]] and [[Moroccans in Spain|Spain]], and a smaller one in the [[British Moroccans|United Kingdom]], the [[Moroccan American|United States]], [[Canada]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and in other [[Arab states]]. A sizeable part of the Moroccan diaspora is composed of [[Moroccan Jews]].

== History ==
[[File:Iberomaurisiense-Capsiense.png|thumb|200px|{{legend|#01DFD7|[[Capsian culture]]}}{{legend|#1a8000|Iberomaurusian culture}}]]
The first [[anatomically modern humans]] (''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'') in North Africa are the makers of the [[Aterian]], a [[Middle Stone Age]] (or [[Middle Paleolithic|Middle Palaeolithic]]) stone tool [[Archaeological industry|culture]]. The earliest Aterian lithic assemblages date to around 145,000 years ago, and were discovered at the site of Ifri n'Ammar in Morocco. This industry was followed by the [[Iberomaurusian]] culture, a backed bladelet industry found throughout the Maghreb. It was originally described in 1909 at the site of Abri Mouillah. Other names for this [[Cro-Magnon]]-associated culture include ''Mouillian'' and ''Oranian''. The [[Epipaleolithic]] Iberomaurusian makers were centred in prehistoric sites, such as [[Taforalt]] and [[Mechta-Afalou]]. They were succeeded by the [[Capsian culture|Capsians]]. The Capsian culture is often thought to have arrived in Africa from the Near East, although it is also suggested that the Iberomaurusians may have been the progenitors of the Capsians. Around 5000 BC, the populations of North Africa were primarily descended from the makers of the Iberomaurusian and Capsian cultures, with a more recent intrusion associated with the [[Neolithic revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Desanges, "The proto-Berbers" 236-245, at 237, in ''General History of Africa, v.II Ancient Civilizations of Africa'' (UNESCO 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The proto-Berber tribes evolved from these prehistoric communities during the Late Bronze to Early Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;Mário Curtis Giordani, ''História da África. Anterior aos descobrimentos'' (Petrópolis, Brasil: Editora Vozes 1985) at 42-43, 77-78. Giordani references Bousquet, ''Les Berbères'' (Paris 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethnic groups ==
Moroccans are primarily of [[Berbers|Berber]] origin, like other neighboring [[Maghreb people|Maghrebians]].&lt;ref name="Bhatia"/&gt; As such, Berbers are descendants of the prehistoric populations of [[Morocco]] through the [[Iberomaurusian]]s and [[Capsian culture|Capsians]].

The [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family may have originated in the [[Mesolithic]] period, perhaps in the context of the [[Capsian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Abdallah Laroui, ''The History of the Maghrib'' (Paris 1970; Princeton 1977) at 17, 60 (re S.W.Asians, referencing the earlier work of Gsell).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Camps|first=Gabriel|title=''Les Berbères''|year=1996|pages=11–14, 65|publisher=Edisud}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 5000 BC, the populations of Morocco were an amalgamation of [[Ibero-Maurisian]] and a minority of [[Capsian]] stock blended with a more recent intrusion associated with the [[Neolithic revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Desanges, "The proto-Berbers" 236–245, at 237, in ''General History of Africa, v.II Ancient Civilizations of Africa'' (UNESCO 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Out of these populations, the proto-[[Berbers|Berber]] tribes formed during the late [[Paleolithic]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Mário Curtis Giordani, ''História da África. Anterior aos descobrimentos'' (Petrópolis, Brasil: Editora Vozes 1985) at 42–43, 77–78. Giordani references Bousquet, ''Les Berbères'' (Paris 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;

Berber-speaking groups include the [[Riffian people|Riffians]], [[Shilha people|Shilha]] and [[Zayanes]]. Arabic-speaking groups include the [[Jebala people|Jebala]] in the north and [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawiyin]] in the southeast.

A small minority of the population is identified as [[Haratin]] and [[Gnawa]]. These are sedentary agriculturalists of non-Berber origin, who inhabit the southern and eastern oases and speak either Berber or Moroccan Arabic.

Between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Arab]] tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their turbulence, [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym|Sulaym]], who often plundered farming areas in the [[Nile Valley]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ibn Khaldun, laudateur et contempteur des Arabes|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/remmm_0035-1474_1966_num_2_1_933|website=Persee.fr|accessdate =1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn Khaldun]], whole tribes set off with women, children, ancestors, animals and camping equipment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Culture==
{{main article|Culture of Morocco}}
[[File:Maroc Marrakech Bahia Luc Viatour 3.jpg|thumb|right|120px|A Moroccan ''[[kaftan]]'']]
Through [[History of Morocco|Moroccan history]], the country had many cultural influences (Europe, Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa). The culture of Morocco shares similar traits with those of neighboring countries, particularly Algeria and Tunisia and to a certain extent Spain.

Morocco influenced modern day Europe, in several fields, from architecture to agriculture, and the introduction of [[Moroccan numbers]], widely used now in the world{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2017}}.

Each region possesses its own uniqueness, contributing to the national culture. Morocco has set among its top priorities the protection of its diversity and the preservation of its cultural heritage.

The traditional dress for men and women is called ''[[djellaba]]'', a long, loose, hooded garment with full sleeves. For special occasions, men also wear a red cap called a bernousse, more commonly known as a [[fez]]. Women wear [[kaftan]]s decorated with ornaments. Nearly all men, and most women, wear [[balgha]] (بلغه). These are soft leather slippers with no heel, often dyed yellow. Women also wear high-heeled sandals, often with silver or gold tinsel.

Moroccan style is a new trend in decoration, which takes its roots from [[Moorish architecture]]. It has been made popular by the vogue of [[Moroccan riad|riad]] renovation in Marrakech. Dar is the name given to one of the most common types of domestic structures in Morocco; it is a home found in a medina, or walled urban area of a city. Most Moroccan homes traditionally adhere to the Dar al-Islam, a series of tenets on Islamic domestic life. Dar exteriors are typically devoid of ornamentation and windows, except occasional small openings in secondary quarters, such as stairways and service areas. These piercings provide light and ventilation.

[[Moroccan cuisine]] primarily consists of a blend of Berber, Moorish and Arab influences. It is known for dishes like [[couscous]] and [[pastilla]], among others. Spices such as cinnamon are also used in Moroccan cooking. Sweets like [[halwa]] are popular, as well as other confections. Cuisines from neighbouring areas have also influenced the country's culinary traditions.

Additionally, Moroccan craftsmanship has a rich tradition of jewellery-making, pottery, leather-work and woodwork.

The music of Morocco ranges and differs according to the various areas of the country. Moroccan music has a variety of styles from complex sophisticated orchestral music to simple music involving only voice and drums. There are three varieties of Berber folk music: village and ritual music, and the music performed by professional musicians. [[Chaabi (Morocco)|Chaabi]] (الشعبي) is a music consisting of numerous varieties which descend from the multifarious forms of Moroccan folk music. Chaabi was originally performed in markets, but is now found at any celebration or meeting. [[Gnawa music|Gnawa]] is a form of music that is mystical. It was gradually brought to Morocco by the Gnawa and later became part of the Moroccan tradition. [[Sufism|Sufi]] brotherhoods ([[Tariqa|tarikas]]) are common in Morocco, and music is an integral part of their spiritual tradition. This music is an attempt at reaching a trance state which inspires mystical ecstasy.

==Languages==
{{main article|Languages of Morocco}}
[[File:Morocco - Linguistic map.png|right|300px|thumb|Linguistic map of Morocco]]
Morocco's official languages are [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Standard Moroccan Berber|Berber]].

The majority of the population speaks [[Moroccan Arabic]]. More than 12 million Moroccans speak Berber varieties, either as a first language or bilingually with Moroccan Arabic. Three different Berber dialects are spoken: [[Riffian language|Riff]], [[Shilha language|Shilha]] (Chleuh) and [[Central Atlas Tamazight]].

[[Hassaniya Arabic]] is spoken in the southern part of the country. Morocco has recently included the protection of Hassaniya in the constitution as part of the July 2011 reforms.

[[French language|French]] is taught universally and still serves as Morocco's primary language of [[:Category:Companies of Morocco|commerce]] and [[Economy of Morocco|economics]]; it is also widely used in education, sciences, government and most education fields.

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is also spoken by some in the northern part of the country as a foreign language. Meanwhile, [[English language|English]] is increasingly becoming more popular among the educated, particularly in the science fields.

The '''Pnong''' (alternatively '''Punong''' and other spelling) are an [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] [[Cambodia]]n minority [[ethnic group]]. They are found primarily in [[Mondulkiri]] province of Cambodia. The Pnong is the largest indigenous highland ethnic group in Cambodia. They have their own language called [[Mnong language|Pnong]], which belongs to [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] branch of [[Austroasiatic languages]]. Majority of Pnong people are [[animism|animists]], but a minority of them follows [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Theravada Buddhism]]. The Pnongs are considered as [[Khmer Loeu]] or Montagnard, which is the collective name given to the various indigenous ethnic groups residing in the highlands of Cambodia.

==Language==
[[Mnong language|Pnong]] language (sometimes spelled 'Mnong') is the native language of the Pnong people. It is a member of [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] branch of [[Austroasiatic languages]] and is distantly related to [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and other [[Khmer Loeu]] languages (exclude [[Jarai people|Jarai]] and [[Rade people|Rade]] which speaks an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language closely related to [[Cham language|Cham]]). There are several dialects of Pnong, some even recognised as a distinct language by linguists, most Pnong dialects are spoken in neighbouring [[Vietnam]], except for Kraol which is spoken within Cambodia.

[[File:ගල්සියඹලා අත්ත.JPG|thumb|''[[Dialium cochinchinense]]'' (velvet tamarind) or ''Kalagn'' in Mnong is part of Pnong traditional medicine. The tree is native to Mondulkiri Province where it is threatened by habitat loss.]]
The Pnong practice a very diverse, dynamic, unstructured and often secretive [[traditional medicine]]. Originally tied to the large [[biodiversity]] of their forest environment, the wars of the 1970s had a significant impact on the Pnong culture and knowledge of traditional medicine, when everybody relocated to either Vietnam or [[Koh Niek]] district. New plants and practices were acquired by the Pnong in these new locations, but upon returning in the 1980s and 1990s, knowledge and use of plants native to their homelands had been forgotten by many. Adequate conventional biomedicine and healthcare can be difficult or impossible to obtain by the locals in the countryside of Cambodia - in particular during the rainy season - and it is therefore official policy of the Cambodian government (backed by the [[WHO]]) to support the practice of traditional medicines. Research shows that, as of 2011, 95% of the inhabitants in two Pnong villages still regularly use medicinal plants. It is hoped that the Pnong culture of traditional medicine can help to build respect for the environment and halt the [[deforestation in Cambodia|deforestation]] and habitat loss of Cambodia on a local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url= |title=Traditional Therapeutic Knowledge of the North-eastern Cambodia Healers, their practices and medicinal plants|publisher=Nomad Recherche et Soutien International|authors=Savajol et.al|date=2011|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pnong in the media==
A Pnong woman, thought to be [[Rochom P'ngieng]], was discovered after presumably spending 19 years alone in the jungle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,244440,00.html "'Half-Animal' Woman Is Discovered After Spending 19 Years Alone in Cambodian Jungle"], Fox News, January 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works about the Pnong include "Living on the margins", the publications of Nomad RSI, the documentary film ''[[Last of the Elephant Men]]'', and the works of Frédéric Bourdier.

In 1482, Portuguese caravels commanded by [[Diogo Cão]] arrived in the [[Kingdom of Kongo]]. Other expeditions followed, and close relations were soon established between the two states. The Portuguese brought firearms and many other technological advances, as well as a new religion (Christianity); in return, the King of the Congo offered plenty of slaves, ivory, and minerals.

The Portuguese colony of Angola was founded in 1575 with the arrival of Paulo Dias de Novais with a hundred families of colonists and four hundred soldiers. Luanda was granted the status of city in 1605. Many Portuguese settlers married native Africans resulting in a mixed-race (''[[mulato]]'', later generally called ''mestiço'') population. Angola was declared a formal [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese province]] in the 19th century, but only in the early 20th century did the mainland government allow large-scale white emigration and settlement to Angola and its other provinces.

In 1960, Angola had up to 172,000 Portuguese settlers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8j5ja5mOFEC|title=Angola Under the Portuguese: The Myth and the Reality|last=Bender|first=Gerald J.|date=1978-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520032217|page=228|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; who significantly contributed to its economy. The majority of whom came from rural agrarian backgrounds in Portugal who saw engaging in commerce in Angola as one of the few means of [[Social mobility|upward social mobility]] available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8j5ja5mOFEC|title=Angola Under the Portuguese: The Myth and the Reality|last=Bender|first=Gerald J.|date=1978-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520032217|page=233|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Angolan war of independence]] began in 1961, triggering off a late colonial development of Angola, there was an influx of Portuguese military personnel, as well as civil servants and other people.&lt;ref&gt;Contrary to the settlers which often had lived in Angola for two or even three generations, the Portuguese arriving during the last phase of colonial occupation did not become identified with Angola.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the number of Portuguese living in Angola went up to about 350,000.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald J.Bender &amp; P. Stanley Yoder, "Whites in Angola on the Eve of Independence", ''Africa Today', 21 (4) 1974, pp. 23 - 37''&lt;/ref&gt; This number would have been higher, had a significant part of the settlers not left for other countries, especially [[Namibia]], [[Brazil]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]]. While most whites then living in Angola sided with Portugal's efforts to suppress the anti-colonial revolt, a minority sympathized with the nationalist movements, and a few even joined them in their fight. The Angolan author [[Pepetela]] is among these. When the [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] regime in Portugal was abolished by a military coup in Portugal, in 1974, and independence was granted to the colonies by the new government, whites overwhelmingly left Angola after independence in 1975.

It is estimated that around 250,000 left the country in 1975 and by 1976 only 30,000 to 40,000 remained in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8j5ja5mOFEC|title=Angola Under the Portuguese: The Myth and the Reality|last=Bender|first=Gerald J.|date=1978-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520032217|page=236|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the departed Portuguese civilians, many were able to take with them only a single suitcase, while some were able to dispatch their household goods and even cars by ship.

A significant minority of them opted for Angola and some of them actively took part in the [[Angolan Civil War]], generally on the side of the [[MPLA]].

After Angola abandoned in 1991 the socialist regime adopted at independence in 1975, many Portuguese Angolans returned to Angola. Due to Angola's economic boom, which started in the 1990s, an increasing number of Portuguese without previous attachment to Angola have migrated to Angola for economic reasons, most importantly the [[Economy of Angola|recent national economic boom]].&lt;ref name="tv1.rtp.pt"&gt;[http://tv1.rtp.pt/noticias/?article=186757&amp;headline=20&amp;visual=9], ''Radio Televisão Portuguesa'', September 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, Angola was the preferred destination for Portuguese migrants in Africa.&lt;ref name="tv1.rtp.pt" /&gt; Portuguese nationals numbered an estimated 120,000 in 2011, reaching about 200,000 in 2013.&lt;ref name="Observatório da Emigração"/&gt;

==Language and religion==

Their native language is  Portuguese, which today is the [[official language]] and [[lingua franca]] of Angola. Their communities existing in Luanda, Benguela and Moçâmedes spoke until the early 20th-century European (in Benguela: initially Brazilian) Portuguese mixed with numerous elements from African languages, especially Kimbundu and Umbundu. In the course of the 20th century, due to the waves of new settlers arriving from Portugal, their language became practically identical with European Portuguese. Some Portuguese Angolans have a lesser or greater mastery of one of the  [[Bantu languages]] – notably [[Kimbundu]], [[South Mbundu language|Umbundu]], and [[Kikongo language|Kikongo]] – but their number has diminished dramatically after independence, and hardly anybody now uses an African language as second languages. Many educated Portuguese Angolans learnt [[French language|French]] and, less intensely, [[English language|English]] during the colonial period; since independence, white as well as black educated people generally learn English, while French has faded into the background. The vast majority of Portuguese Angolans are [[Christianity|Christians]], mostly [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], although many of them do not practice their religion. A very small number of them are [[Judaism|Jews]], whose ancestors escaped the [[Inquisition]].

'''Public News Service''' (usually shortened to '''PNS''') was launched in 1996  by journalist Lark Corbeil in Idaho. Today, PNS has 37 state-based news services that provide multi-platform content for free to news outlets as a way to advocate journalism in the public interest.&lt;ref name="Alternet"&gt;{{cite news|title=Heir America |url=https://www.alternet.org/story/22277/heir_america |publisher=[[Alternet]]|date=June 24, 2005|accessdate=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Q&amp;A: Public News Service founder on ‘whirlwind’ since reporter’s arrest|url=https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/tom-price-reporter-arrest-trump.php|publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=2017-05-17|accessdate=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Dan Heyman, a PNS producer in West Virginia, was arrested at the state capitol for asking former Health and Human Services Secretary [[Tom Price (American politician)|Tom Price]] a question in an “aggressive manner.” Heyman was jailed and charged for willful disruption of state government processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HHS secretary says police ‘did what they felt was appropriate’ in arresting a West Virginia journalist|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/05/10/west-virginia-journalist-arrested-after-asking-hhs-secretary-tom-price-a-question/|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=May 11, 2017|accessdate=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, the misdemeanor charge against Heyman was dropped after “a careful review” by the [[Kanawha County]] prosecutor’s office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charge Dropped Against Reporter Who Questioned Tom Price|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/business/media/tom-price-journalist-arrest.html|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=September 6, 2017|accessdate=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''puppet state''' is a [[Nation state|state]] that is [[De jure|''de jure'']] independent but is [[De facto|''de facto'']] completely dependent upon an outside power.&lt;ref name="Marek"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marek|first=Krystyna|title=Identity and Continuity of States in Public International Law|year=1954|publisher=Library Droz|isbn=9782600040440|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is nominally [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] but effectively controlled by a foreign or otherwise alien power, for reasons such as financial interests.&lt;ref name="McNeely1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=McNeely|first=Connie L.|title=Constructing the Nation-state: International Organization and Prescriptive Action|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8JKEj94TsP4C&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=13 September 2017|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29398-6|page=61|quote=The term 'puppet state' is used to describe nominal sovereigns under effective foreign control...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A puppet state preserves the external paraphernalia of independence like a name, flag, anthem, constitution, law codes, motto and government but in reality is an organ of another state which created, sponsored or otherwise controls the government of the puppet state.&lt;ref name="Raic2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Raič|first=David|title=Statehood and the Law of Self-Determination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7UOyPGYBkwC&amp;pg=PA81|accessdate=13 September 2017|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=90-411-1890-X|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puppet states are not recognized as [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] under [[international law]].&lt;ref name="Lemkin2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lemkin|first=Raphael|authorlink=Raphael Lemkin|title=Axis Rule in Occupied Europe: Laws of Occupation, Analysis of Government, Proposals for Redress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0in2wOY-W0C&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=13 September 2017|year=2008|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-58477-901-8|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology of the term ==
In the [[Middle Ages]] [[vassal state]]s existed which were based on delegation of rule of a country from a King to noble men of lower rank. Since the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 the concept of a nation came into existence where [[Westphalian sovereignty|sovereignty]] was connected more to the people who inhabited the land than to the nobility who owned the land. The term is a metaphor which compares a state or government to a puppet controlled by an outside puppeteer using strings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ultra Hush-hush |last=Shapiro |first=Stephen |year=2003 |publisher=Annick Press |isbn=1-55037-778-7 |page=38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iH6gFG1v-kUC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq |quote=Puppet state: a country whose government is being controlled by the government of another country, much as a puppeteer controls the strings on a marionette }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use of the term "puppet government" is from 1884, in reference to the [[Khedivate of Egypt]].&lt;ref name=etymoline&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=puppet (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=puppet&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 19th century ==
The [[Batavian Republic]] was established in the Netherlands under French revolutionary protection.

In Eastern Europe, France established a Polish client state of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].

In Italy, republics were created in the late 18th and early 19th centuries with the assistance and encouragement of [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]].  See also [[French client republic]]s.

In 1836 U.S. citizens allowed to live in the Mexican state of Texas revolted against the Mexican government to establish a U.S.-backed [[Republic of Texas]], a country that existed less than 10 years (from May 14, 1836 to December 29, 1845) before it was annexed to the United States of America.
However, in August 1837, [[Memucan Hunt, Jr.]], the Texan minister to the United States, submitted the first official annexation proposal to the [[Martin van Buren|Van Buren]] administration (the first American-led attempts to take over Mexican Texas [[Long Expedition|by filibustering date back to 1819]] and [[Fredonian Rebellion|by separatist settlers since 1826]]).

In 1896 [[United Kingdom|Britain]] [[Anglo-Zanzibar War|established a state]] in [[Zanzibar]].

== World War I ==
*[[Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918)|Kingdom of Poland]] (1916–1918) – The Central Powers' forces occupied [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Congress Poland]] in 1915 and in 1916 the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] created a Polish Monarchy in order to exploit the occupied territories in an easier way and mobilize the Poles against the Russians (see [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]]). In 1918 the state became independent and formed the backbone of the new internationally recognized [[Second Polish Republic]].
*[[Kingdom of Lithuania (1918)]] – after Russia's defeat, the Germans established a Lithuanian kingdom. However it became [[Republic of Lithuania (1918-1940)|an independent republic]] with Germany's defeat.
*[[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)]] – in 1915 the Imperial German forces occupied the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Courland Governorate]] and the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ended the [[Eastern Front of World War I|war in the east]], so the local ethnic [[Baltic Germans]] established a Duchy under the German crown from that part of [[Ober Ost]], with a common return of civil administration in favor of military. This state was very swiftly merged with the [[Baltic State Duchy]], and German-occupied territories of [[Russian Empire]] in Livonia and Estonia, into a multi-ethnic [[United Baltic Duchy]].
*[[Kingdom of Finland (1918)]] – A short-lived monarchy in Finland after the end of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|czarist rule]].
* [[Provisional National Government of the Southwestern Caucasus]] and [[Provisional Government of Western Thrace]] were the provisional republics that were established by the Turkish minorities in Thrace and Caucasia, after the [[Ottoman Empire]] lost its lands in these regions.

During [[Empire of Japan|Japan's imperial period]], and particularly during the [[Pacific War]] (parts of which are considered the Pacific theatre of [[World War II]]), the Imperial Japanese regime established a number of dependent states.

=== Nominally sovereign states ===
* [[Manchukuo]] (1932–1945), set up in [[Manchuria]] under the leadership of the last [[Chinese Emperor]], [[Puyi]].&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, Phillip S., ''Rays of The Rising Sun, Armed Forces of Japan’s Asian Allies 1931–45, Volume I: China &amp; Manchuria,'' 2004. Helion &amp; Co. Ltd., 26 Willow Rd., Solihull, West Midlands, England, pg.7–36.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mengjiang]], set up in [[Inner Mongolia]] on May 12, 1936, as the Mongol Military Government (蒙古軍政府) was renamed in October 1937 as the Mongol United Autonomous Government (蒙古聯盟自治政府). On September 1, 1939, the predominantly [[Han Chinese]] governments of South Chahar Autonomous Government and North Shanxi Autonomous Government were merged with the Mongol Autonomous Government, creating the new Mengjiang United Autonomous Government (蒙疆聯合自治政府). All of these were headed by [[De Wang]].&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, Phillip S., ''Rays of The Rising Sun, Armed Forces of Japan’s Asian Allies 1931–45, Volume I: China &amp; Manchuria,'' 2004. Helion &amp; Co. Ltd., 26 Willow Rd., Solihull, West Midlands, England, pg.49–57,88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[East Hebei Autonomous Council]] – a state in northeast China between 1935 and 1938.
*[[Great Way Government|Dadao government (Shanghai 1937–1940)]] – A short-lived regime based in Shanghai.
*[[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]] – First regime established in [[Nanjing]] after the [[Battle of Nanjing]]. Later fused into the Provisional Government of China.
* [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937–1940)|Provisional Government of China]] December 14, 1937 – March 30, 1940 – Incorporated into the Nanjing Nationalist Government on March 30, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, Phillip S., ''Rays of The Rising Sun, Armed Forces of Japan’s Asian Allies 1931–45, Volume I: China &amp; Manchuria,'' 2004. Helion &amp; Co. Ltd., 26 Willow Rd., Solihull, West Midlands, England, pg.44–47,85–87.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wang Jingwei Government|Nanjing Nationalist Government]] ( March 30, 1940 – 1945) – Established in [[Nanjing]] under the leadership of [[Wang Jingwei]].&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, Phillip S., ''Rays of The Rising Sun, Armed Forces of Japan’s Asian Allies 1931–45, Volume I: China &amp; Manchuria,'' 2004. Helion &amp; Co. Ltd., 26 Willow Rd., Solihull, West Midlands, England, pg.63–89.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[State of Burma]] ([[Myanmar|Burma]], 1942–1945) – Head of State: [[Ba Maw]].
* [[Second Philippine Republic]] (1943–1945) – government headed by [[José P. Laurel]] as [[President of the Philippines|President]].
* The [[Provisional Government of Free India]] (1943–1945), set up in Singapore in October 1943 by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] was in charge of Indian expatriates and military personnel in Japanese Southeast Asia. The government was established with prospective control of Indian territory to fall to the offensive to India. Of the territory of post-independence India, the government took charge of Kohima (after it fell to Japanese-INA offensive), parts of Manipur that fell to both the Japanese 15th Army as well as to the INA, and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]].
* [[Empire of Vietnam]] (Hán tự: 越南帝国) (March–August 1945) – Emperor [[Bảo Đại]]'s regime with [[Tran Trong Kim]] as prime minister after proclaiming independence from France.
* [[Colonial Cambodia#Emergence of Khmer nationalism|Kingdom of Cambodia]] ([[Cambodia]], March–August 1945) – King [[Norodom Sihanouk]]'s regime with [[Son Ngoc Thanh]] as Prime Minister after proclaiming independence from France.
* [[Kingdom of Laos]] – King [[Sisavang Vong]]'s régime &lt;!--with [[?]] as prime minister --&gt;after proclaiming independence from France.
* [[Nauru]], [[Palau]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]]

=== Unrealized drafts for dependent states ===
[[Empire of Japan|Japan]] had made drafts for other dependent states.

The [[Provisional Priamurye Government]] never got beyond the planning stages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In addition to the Japanese, the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] supported the formation of this state.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In 1945, as the Second World War drew to a close, Japan planned to grant independence to the [[Netherlands East Indies]] ([[Indonesia]]).  These plans ended when the Japanese surrendered on 15 August 1945.

== Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy ==
{{Further information|Axis powers of World War II|Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II}}

Several European governments under the domination of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Italy]] during [[World War II]] have been described as "puppet régimes".  The formal means of control in [[German-occupied Europe|occupied Europe]] varied greatly. These states fall into several categories.

=== Existing states in alliance with Germany and Italy ===
* [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]]'s [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]] (1944–1945) – The pro-Nazi régime of Prime Minister [[Ferenc Szálasi]] supported by the [[Arrow Cross Party]] was a German puppet régime.  Arrow Cross was a pro-German, anti-Semitic Fascist party.  Szálasi was installed by the Germans after Hitler launched [[Operation Panzerfaust]] and had the Hungarian Regent, Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]], removed and placed under house arrest.  Horthy was forced to abdicate in favor of Szálasi.  Szálasi fought on even after Budapest fell and Hungary was completely overrun.

=== Existing states under German or Italian rule ===
* [[Albania]] [[Albania under Italy|under Italy]]  (1940–1943) and [[Albania under Nazi Germany]] (1943–1944) – The Kingdom of Albania was an Italian [[protectorate]] and puppet régime.  Italy invaded Albania in 1939 and ended the rule of [[Zog of Albania|King Zog I]].  Zog was exiled and King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] added King of Albania to his titles. King Victor Emmanuel and [[Shefqet Bej Verlaci]], Albanian Prime Minister and Head of State, controlled the Italian protectorate.  Shefqet Bej Verlaci was replaced as Prime Minister and Head of State by [[Mustafa Merlika-Kruja|Mustafa Merlika Kruja]] on 3 December 1941.  The Germans occupied Albania when Italy quit the war in 1943 and [[Ibrahim Bej Biçaku]], [[Mehdi Bej Frashëri]], and [[Rexhep Bej Mitrovica]] became successive Prime Minister under the [[Nazis]].
* [[Vichy France]] (1942–1944) – The Vichy French régime of [[Philippe Pétain]] had limited autonomy from 1940 to 1942, being heavily dependent on Germany. The Vichy government controlled many of France's colonies and the unoccupied part of France and enjoyed international recognition.  In 1942, the Germans occupied the portion of France administered by the Vichy government and installed a new leadership, which ended much of the international legitimacy the government had.
* [[Monaco]] (1943–1945) – In 1943, the Italian army invaded and occupied Monaco, setting up a fascist administration. Shortly thereafter, following Mussolini's collapse in Italy, the German army occupied Monaco and began the deportation of the Jewish population. Among them was [[René Blum (ballet)|René Blum]], founder of the Ballet de l'Opera, who died in a Nazi extermination camp.

=== New states formed to reflect national aspirations ===
* [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak Republic]] under the [[Slovak People's Party]] (1939–1945) – The Slovak Republic was a German [[client state]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} The Slovak People's Party was a [[Clerical fascism|clerofascist]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] movement associated with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. [[Monsignor]] [[Jozef Tiso]] became the president in a nominally independent Slovakia.
* [[Independent State of Croatia]] (1941–1945) – The Independent State of Croatia (''Nezavisna Država Hrvatska'' or NDH) was a German and Italian puppet régime.  On paper, the NDH was a kingdom under King [[Tomislav II of Croatia|Tomislav II]] (Aimone, Duke of Spoleto) of the [[House of Savoy]], but Tomislav II was only a figurehead in Croatia who never exercised any real power, with [[Ante Pavelić]] being a somewhat independent leader ("poglavnik"), though staying obedient to Rome and Berlin.

=== States under control of Germany and Italy ===
* [[Hellenic State (1941-1944)|Greece]] (1941–1944) – The [[Hellenic State (1941-1944)|Hellenic State]] administration  of [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]], [[Konstantinos Logothetopoulos]] and [[Ioannis Rallis]] was a "collaborationist" puppet government&lt;ref&gt;''...managed to see the puppet Greek Prime Minister Ioannis Rallis through'' @ [https://books.google.com/books?id=75yqSStYjocC&amp;pg Sephardi Jewry: A History of the Judeo-Spanish Community, 14th–20th Centuries – Page 168]&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Axis occupation of Greece]]. Germany, Italy and Bulgaria occupied different portions of Greece at different times during these régimes.
* [[Government of National Salvation]] (1941–1944) – The government of General [[Milan Nedić]] and sometimes known as [[Nedić's Serbia]] was a German puppet régime operating in the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Serbia also had a Nazi puppet regime headed by Milan Nedic'' @ [https://books.google.com/books?id=KYHH6mGE9JoC&amp;pg The Balkanization of the West: The Confluence of Postmodernism and Postcommunism – Page 198]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lokot Republic]], Russia (1941–1943) – The Lokot Republic under [[Konstantin Voskoboinik]] and [[Bronislaw Kaminski]] was a semi-autonomous region in Nazi-occupied Russia under an all-Russian administration.  The republic covered the area of several [[raions]] of Oryol and Kursk oblasts. It was directly associated with the [[Kaminski Brigade]] and the [[Russian Liberation Army]] (''Russkaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya'' or RONA).
* [[Belarusian Central Rada]] (1943–1944) – The Belarusian Central Council (''Biełaruskaja Centralnaja Rada'') was nominally the government of Belarus from 1943–1944. It was a collaborationist government established by Nazi Germany (see [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]).
* [[Quisling regime|Quisling's Norwegian National government]] (1942–1945) – The [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]] started with all authority held by German Reich Commissioner (''[[Reichskommissar]]'') [[Josef Terboven]], who exercised this through the [[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]]. The Norwegian pro-German fascist [[Vidkun Quisling]] had attempted a [[coup d'état]] against the Norwegian government during the German invasion on 9 April 1940, but he was not appointed by the Germans to head another native government until 1 February 1942.
*[[Independent State of Croatia]] (1941–1945) – Formed after the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], the Independent State of Croatia was led by the Croatian fascist leader [[Ante Pavelić]]. It controlled all or most of Croatia, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], parts of [[Serbia]], and parts of [[Slovenia]]. The government relied on German support for much of its existence.

===Italian Social Republic ===
* The [[Italian Social Republic]] (1943–1945, known also as the Republic of Salò) – General [[Pietro Badoglio]] and King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] withdrew [[Italy]] from the [[Axis Powers]] and moved the government to southern Italy, already conquered by the Allies.  In response, the Germans occupied northern Italy and founded the Italian Social Republic (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana'' or RSI) with Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] as its "Head of State" and "Minister of Foreign Affairs".  While the RSI government had some trappings of an independent state, it was completely dependent both economically and politically on Germany.

Iran re-took control in December and the leaders of the state were executed in March 1947 in [[Mahabad]].
* [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] (1978–1991)

As Soviet forces prevailed over the German Army on the Eastern Front during the Second World War, the Soviet Union supported the creation of communist governments in all of Eastern Europe. Specifically, the [[People's Republic]]s in [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]], and [[Albania]] were dominated by the Soviet Union. While all of these People's Republics did not "officially" take power until after [[World War II]] ended, they all have roots in pro-Communist war-time governments.

=== United Kingdom ===
Historically, the British Empire has planted various dictators on thrones because of its own geopolitical interests. For example, the British occupation forces brought back Sardar Abdur Rahman from Bukhara, imposed on him the Gandumak Surrender Treaty, and made him Amir of Afghanistan. This extremely ruthless man, ruled as a puppet dictator for two decades (1880-1901), applying barbaric practices against his own subjects, but remaining dependent on British government of India for money, weapon and protection.

The Axis demand for oil and the concern of the Allies that Germany would look to the oil-rich Middle East for a solution, caused the invasion of Iraq by the United Kingdom and the invasion of Iran by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Pro-Axis governments in both Iraq and Iran were removed and replaced with Allied-dominated governments.

*[[Kingdom of Iraq]] (1941–1943) – Iraq was important to the United Kingdom because of its position on the route to India.  Iraq also could provide strategic oil reserves. But, due to the UK's weakness early in the war, Iraq backed away from the pre-war [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1930)|Anglo-Iraqi Alliance]]. On 1 April 1941, the Hashemite monarchy in Iraq was over-thrown and there was a [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|pro-German ''coup d'état'']] under [[Rashid Ali]]. The Rashid Ali regime began negotiations with the [[Axis powers]] and military aid was quickly sent to Mosul via Vichy French-controlled Syria. The Germans provided a squadron of twin engine fighters and a squadron of medium bombers. The Italians provided a squadron of biplane fighters. In mid-April 1941, a brigade of the [[10th Indian Infantry Division]] landed at [[Basra]] ([[Operation Sabine]]). On 30 April, British forces at [[RAF Habbaniya]] were besieged by a numerically inferior Iraqi force. On 2 May, the British launched pre-emptive [[airstrikes]] against the Iraqis and the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] began. By the end of May, the siege of RAF Habbaniya was lifted, Falluja was taken, Baghdad was surrounded by British forces, and the pro-German government of Rashid Ali collapsed. Rashid Ali and his supporters fled the country. The Hashemite monarchy (King [[Faisal II]] and Prime Minister [[Nuri al-Said]]) was restored. The UK then forced Iraq to declare war on the Axis in 1942. Commonwealth forces remained in Iraq until 26 October 1947.
*[[Pahlavi dynasty|Imperial State of Iran]] (1941–1943) – German workers in Iran caused the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to question Iran's neutrality. In addition, Iran's geographical position was important to the Allies. So, in August 1941, the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]] (Operation Countenance) was launched. In September 1941, [[Rezā Shāh|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] was forced to abdicate his throne and went into [[exile]]. He was replaced by his son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was willing to declare war on the Axis powers. By January 1942, the UK and the Soviet Union agreed to end their occupation of Iran six months after the end of the war.

== Decolonization and [[Cold War]] ==
In some cases, the process of [[decolonization]] has been managed by the decolonizing power to create a [[neo-colony]], that is a nominally independent state whose economy and politics permits continued foreign domination.  Neo-colonies are not normally considered puppet states.

=== Dutch East Indies ===
The [[Netherlands]] formed several puppet states in the former [[Dutch East Indies]] as part of the effort to quell the [[Indonesian National Revolution]]ː
* [[State of East Indonesia|East Indonesia]]
* [[State of East Java|East Java]]
* [[East Sumatra]]
* [[State of Madura|Madura]]
* [[Pasundan]]
* [[State of South Sumatra|South Sumatra]]
* [[Bandjar Region|Bandjar]]
* [[Bangka (United States of Indonesia)|Bangka]]
* [[Biliton (United States of Indonesia)|Biliton]]
* [[Central Java (United States of Indonesia)|Central Java]]
* [[State of East Kalimantan|East Kalimantan]]
* [[Great Dayak]]
* [[Southeast Borneo Federation]]
* [[Pontianak Sultanate|West Kalimantan]]

=== Congo Crisis ===
Following [[Belgian Congo]]'s independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)]] in 1960, Belgian interests supported the short-lived breakaway state of [[State of Katanga|Katanga]] (1960–1963).

=== East Asia during the Cold War ===
During the 1950–1953 [[Korean War]], [[South Korea]] and the United States alleged that North Korea was a Soviet puppet state. At the same time, [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] was accused of being an American puppet state by [[North Korea]] and its allies. Additionally, in 1951 [[Dean Rusk]], the [[Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs]], branded the [[People's Republic of China]] a "Slavic Manchukuo", implying that it was a puppet state of the Soviet Union just as [[Manchukuo]] had been a puppet state of the [[Empire of Japan]].  This position was commonly taken by American propaganda of the 1950s, despite the fact that the Chinese communist movement had [[Sino-Soviet Split|developed largely independently]] of the Soviet Union.

Following the victory of the [[Viet Minh]] in the [[First Indochina War]], the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva Accords]] stipulated that Vietnam would be divided for two years only, until national elections could be held. However, the Americans along with [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] feared that [[Ho Chi Minh]] and the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communists]] would win the election. The [[State of Vietnam]] and the [[United States]] didn't sign the Geneva Accords, citing that it was impossible to hold free and fair nationwide democratic elections in the communist North, and this was later expressed by UN observers monitoring the [[partition of Vietnam]]. As a result, South Vietnam and the U.S. were not bound by its terms. In 1955 the Vietnamese president [[Ngo Dinh Diem]], supported by the [[United States]], declared the independence of the [[Republic of Vietnam]] in the southern half of Vietnam. Over time, Diem grew increasingly uncomfortable with the role of the U.S. in his country, complaining that they were increasing the conflict with North Vietnam. Diem's complaints became more vocal as American soldiers, called "advisors", continued to pour into the country, and some began calling Diem an uncooperative client and a puppet pulling his own strings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|title=Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq|year=2006|publisher=Times Books|location=New York City|isbn=0-8050-7861-4|pages=153–156|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q3o2BaNiJksC&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After he became seen more as a liability than an asset to America, [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem was assassinated]] in 1963 with the complicity of the [[CIA]] and [[Cable 243|John F.

During the [[Vietnam War]], South Vietnam was allied with the U.S. and other anti-communist states in Asia and the West, whereas North Vietnam was allied with [[China]], and particularly the [[Soviet Union]], and with other socialist and communist nations.

=== South Africa's Bantustans ===
During the 1970s and 1980s, four ethnic [[bantustan]]s, some of which were extremely [[gerrymandering|fragmented]], were carved out of [[South Africa]] and given nominal [[sovereignty]]. Two ([[Ciskei]] and [[Transkei]]) were for the [[Xhosa people]]; and one each for the [[Tswana people]] ([[Bophuthatswana]]) and for the [[Venda people]] ([[Venda]] [[Republic]]).

The principal purpose of these states was to remove the Xhosa, Tswana and Venda peoples from South African citizenship (and so to provide grounds for denying them democratic rights). All four were reincorporated into [[South Africa]] in 1994.

== After the Cold War ==

=== Republic of Kuwait ===
The [[Republic of Kuwait]] was a short-lived pro-[[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraqi]] state in the Persian Gulf that only existed three weeks before [[Kuwait Governorate|it was annexed by Iraq]] in 1990.

'''''Quentin Durward''''' is a historical novel by [[Walter Scott]], first published in 1823.  The story concerns a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Archery|archer]] in [[Garde Écossaise|the service]] of the French King [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] (1423&amp;ndash;1483).

==Composition and sources==
''Quentin Durward'' was composed in a remarkably short space of time. After carrying out some preparatory research towards the end of 1822 Scott began writing in January 1823 and supplied the finishing sentences in response to a request from his coadjutor James Ballantyne on 3 May. His principal source was the ''Mémoires'' of Philippe de Comines, but as usual he adapts historical facts freely in the construction of his fiction: most notably the murder of the Bishop of Liège occurs 14 years before its historical date, and Orleans and his future wife Joan appear as adults rather than young children. He was also inspired by manuscript material deriving from continental journeys by his friend James Skene of Rubislaw.

==Editions==
The first edition was published in three volumes in London on 17 May 1823 and in Edinburgh two days later. As with all the [[Waverley novels]] before 1827 publication was anonymous. In 1830 Scott provided it with an introduction and notes for the 'Magnum' edition where it appeared in two volumes in December 1831 and January 1832. The standard modern edition, by J. H. Alexander and G. A. M. Wood, was published as Volume 15 of [[the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels]] in 2001: this is based on the first edition; the 'Magnum' material appears in Volume 25b.

== Plot introduction ==
The plot centres on the medieval rivalry between [[Louis XI of France]] and [[Charles the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]]. Louis incites the citizens of [[Liège]] to revolt against Charles, and they seize and murder Charles's brother-in-law, [[Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège]], under the command of Louis's ally, [[William de la Marck]], who was hoping to install his son in Louis de Bourbon's place (a real historical event which occurred in 1482).

At the time of the murder, Louis is present in Charles' camp at Peronne, hoping to fool him with a false display of friendship. Charles, however, sees through his mask of deceit, accuses him of instigating the uprising, and has him imprisoned. Louis's superior coolness of mind permits him to allay Charles's suspicions and to regain his liberty. In a sub-plot, the Burgundian heiress Isabelle de Croye takes refuge at Louis's court when Charles attempts to give her hand in marriage to his odious favourite Campo-Basso. Louis, in turn, resolves to give her in marriage to the bandit-captain [[William de la Marck]], and sends her to Flanders under the pretence of placing her under the protection of the Bishop of Liège. She is guarded on her journey by Quentin Durward, an archer, who has left behind poverty in Scotland to join the Archers of Louis's [[Garde Écossaise|Scottish Guard]]. Quentin prevents the intended treachery and earns Isabelle's love. Charles, though, promises her in marriage to the Duke of Orléans (heir to the French crown) but she refuses, and, in anger, the Duke promises her to whoever brings him the head of de la Marck. This Quentin does with the help of his uncle, Ludovic Lesley, and wins Isabelle's hand.

== Plot summary ==
The story takes place in the year 1468.&lt;ref&gt;Stated at the end of chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The age of feudalism and chivalry was passing away, and the King of France was inciting the wealthy citizens of Flanders against his own rebellious vassal the Duke of Burgundy. Quentin Durward had come to [[Tours]], where his uncle was one of the Scottish body guard maintained by Louis XI, to seek military service, and was invited by the king, disguised as a merchant, to breakfast at the inn, and supplied by him with money. Having narrowly escaped being hanged by the provost-marshal for cutting down Zamet, whom he found suspended from a tree, he was enlisted by Lord Crawford, and learned the history of Jacqueline. In the presence-chamber he was recognised by Louis, and the royal party were preparing for a hunting excursion, when the Count of Crèvecœur arrived with a peremptory demand for the instant surrender of the duke's ward, the Countess of Croye, who had fled from Burgundy with her aunt to escape a forced marriage; and proclaimed that his master renounced his allegiance to the crown of France. In the chase which followed Durward saved the king's life from a boar, for which service Louis, after consulting with his barber, entrusted him with the duty of conducting the Countess and Lady Hameline, ostensibly to the protection of the Bishop of Liege, but really that they might fall into the hands of William de la Marck. After proceeding some distance they were overtaken by Dunois and the Duke of Orléans, who would have seized the countess, but were prevented by Lord Crawford, who arrived in pursuit and made prisoners of them. Then Hayraddin came riding after them, and under his guidance they journeyed for nearly a week, when Quentin discovered that the Bohemian was in league with De la Marck. He accordingly altered their route, and they reached the bishop's castle in safety.

A few days afterwards, however, it was assaulted by the citizens, and Hayraddin having effected Lady Hameline's escape with Marthon, Quentin rushed back to save the countess, and, at Gieslaer's suggestion, Pavilion passed them as his daughter and her sweetheart into the great hall where the outlaw, who was known as the Boar of Ardennes, was feasting with the rioters. The bishop, who was also governor of the city, was then dragged in, and, having denounced his captor, was murdered by a stroke of Nikkel Blok's cleaver. There was a shout for vengeance, but De la Marck summoned his soldiers, upon which Quentin held a dirk at the throat of his son Carl, and exhorted the citizens to return to their homes. With the syndic's help Lady Isabella and her protector reached [[Charleroi]], where she was placed in a convent, while he carried the news to the Duke of Burgundy, at whose court Louis, with a small retinue, was a guest. Charles, in a furious rage, accused the king of being privy to the sacrilege, and caused him to be treated as a prisoner.

At a council the following day he was charged with abetting rebellion among the vassals of Burgundy, and the countess was brought as a witness against him. She admitted her fault, and Quentin Durward was being questioned respecting his escort of her, when a herald arrived with a demand from De la Marck to be acknowledged as Prince-Bishop of Liège, and for the release of his ally the King of France. Louis replied that he intended to gibbet the murderer, and the messenger, who was discovered to be Hayraddin, was sentenced to death, the quarrel between the duke and the king being at the same time adjusted, on the understanding that the Duke of Orléans should marry Lady Isabelle. Crèvecœur, however, interceded for her, and it was arranged that whoever should bring the head of the Boar of Ardennes might claim her hand. Quentin, who had learnt his plans from the Bohemian, advanced with the allied troops of France and Burgundy against his stronghold, and a desperate battle ensued. At length the young Scot was in the act of closing with De la Marck, when Pavilion's daughter implored his protection from a French soldier; and, while placing her in safety, his uncle La Balafré fought the ruffian, and carried his head to the royal presence. Lord Crawford declared him to be of gentle birth, but the old soldier having resigned his pretensions to his nephew, King Louis vouched for Quentin's services and prudence, and the duke being satisfied as to his descent, remarked that it only remained to inquire what were the fair lady's sentiments towards the young emigrant in search of honourable adventure, who, by his sense, firmness and gallantry, thus became the fortunate possessor of wealth, rank and beauty.

Ch. 7 The Enrolment:  Quentin is enlisted into the Guards by their commander Lord Crawford, who says that Isabelle of Croye and her aunt Lady Hameline have arrived to claim Louis's protection after her rejection of her guardian Charles's proposal that she marry his favourite Campo-basso.

Ch. 8  The Envoy: At court Louis, whom Quentin recognises as Maitre Pierre, attempts to mollify the Burgundian Count Crevecœur who has demanded the return of the Croyes.

Ch. 3 (13)  The Journey: Delighted with his commission, Quentin accompanies Louis to the sage Galeotti, who says the scheme will bring success to the sender but danger to those sent; he promises to carry out an astronomical calculation relating to Louis' plan to negotiate with Charles in person, but privately determines to inform Balue.

Ch. 11 (34) The Execution: Before his execution by Tristran and Petit-André, Hayraddin tells Quentin of William's plan to disguise some of his men as French auxiliaries at Liège.

Ch. 12 (35) A Prize for Honour: Louis and Charles agree that Isabelle will be awarded to the warrior who kills William.

Ch. 13 (36) The Sally: As the Burgundian forces set out for Liège with Louis in attendance Quentin gives Isabelle a letter from Hameline, passed on by Hayraddin before his execution, defending William whom she has married. Quentin discloses William's tactic to Louis and Charles.

Ch. 14 (37) The Sally: Quentin is diverted from encountering William in battle by the necessity of saving Pavillon's daughter from assault. Balafré kills William and surrenders his prize Isabelle to Quentin. 

==Reception==

The reviews of ''Quentin Durward'' were mostly favourable, rating it among the best of the Waverley Novels, though there were a few dissenting voices.&lt;ref&gt;For a full list of contemporaneous British reviews see William S. Ward, ''Literary Reviews in British Periodicals, 1821‒1826: A Bibliography'' (New York and London, 1977), 177. For a earlier annotated list see James Clarkson Corson, ''A Bibliography of Sir Walter Scott'' (Edinburgh and London, 1943), 253–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly appreciated were the witty Introduction, the contrasting depictions of Louis and Charles, the striking incidents and descriptions, the control of the plot (though some thought it thin), and the vivid presentation of an interesting and unfamiliar period. The most common adverse criticisms were that historical analysis was too prominent, threatening to overpower the fiction, and that the female characters were weak. Sales in Britain were initially rather slow, perhaps because it came too quickly after Peveril of the Peak, but it was an immediate hit on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of Sir Walter Scott'', ed. H. J. Grierson and others, 12 vols (London, 1932‒37), 8.21, 76; J. G. Lockhart, ''Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart''., 7 vols (Edinburgh, 1837‒38), 5.280‒81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Savu''' (also known as '''Sabu''', '''Sawu''' or '''Hawu''') people are the people of [[Savu]] and smaller neighbouring [[Raijua]] in [[East Nusa Tenggara]], [[Indonesia]].

Savu had little to interest traders from Europe, or neighbouring kingdoms, and it remained largely insular until the late-20th century.

==Geographical structure==
Savu originally had six independent domains, Teriwu, Liae, Dimu, Menia, Seba and Mesara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/jissh/article/viewFile/URN%3ANBN%3ANL%3AUI%3A10-1-100162/8444 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193735/http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/jissh/article/viewFile/URN:NBN:NL:UI:10-1-100162/8444 |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Menia was defeated by Seba in the 19th century, while Teriwu disappeared much earlier.

A raja and fetor of each domain were appointed by the Dutch during colonial times.

After independence Savu was split into two [[Subdistricts of Indonesia|kecamatan]], East Savu (Liae and Dimu) and West Savu (Seba and Mesara plus Raijua).

In the 2000s, the political structure of Savu has been reorganised to more closely reflect traditional lines, which retained local significance over and above the arbitrary divisions imposed by the Indonesian government. The kecamatan now are Hawu Mehara, West Savu, Central Savu, East Savu, Liae, and Raijua.

==Genealogy kinship==
The people of Savu are inherent in having a small family. The Savu people practice [[bilateral descent]], with descendants of one the ''udu'' ([[patrilineal]] groups) termed ''kerogo'', as well as a matrilineal descendant that is traced to in Savu mythology to one of two sisters. The [[Moiety (kinship)|moiety]] of the two sisters is termed ''hubi''; the ''hubi'' are divided into ''wini''.

Marriage is between a man and a woman of the same ''wini'' as his mother, or at a minimum within the same ''hubi''. There is non-reciprocal gift-giving from the groom's family to that of the bride. ''Wini'' and ''hubi'' play a role in ceremonies such as weddings, funerals and baptisms. The conclusion of marriage is within the three-year union. The marital residence of a Savu family is [[patrilocal]].

Savu [[ikat]] (traditional weaving) reflect many aspects of Savu genealogy, including specific motifs and colours representing the weaver's hubu and wini.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/btlv/article/viewFile/3100/3861&lt;/ref&gt;

Savu people place importance on genealogy, tracking both ''hubi'' and ''kerogo'' back through many generations.

==Culture==
[[File:Girl from Melolo, Wanita di Indonesia p26 (Kon Luchtvaart Mij).jpg|thumb|upright|A Savu girl from Melolo, circa 1950.]]
The Savu measure time in units that range from six to 49 years, depending on the domain.

Savu people place great importance on their genealogy, with names chosen to avoid repetition, and genealogies recited during ritual performances such as at funerals, where the connection of the departed to his or her ancestors is memorialised. The memorising of genealogies has also been observed in neighbouring cultures, in [[Roti]] and [[Kedang]].

As with many others parts of Indonesia, [[betel nut]] is popular, as indeed is [[tuak]], wine made from the [[Borassus flabellifer|sugar palm]], as well as the sap, drunk fresh from the tree.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/travel/history-and-lethargy-on-sabu-island/378141&lt;/ref&gt; The palm tree is treated with great respect, and the ''apu lodo'' priest, descendant of the sun supervises the palm tapping season.

===Architecture===
The Savu house is built on poles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.panoramio.com/photo/43276353 |title=Rumah Adat Sawu or Savu |publisher=Panoramio |accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is designed to resemble a [[proa]] boat, with the front beams resembling its [[Bow (ship)|bow]]. There are also [[anthropomorphic]] elements in the terminology used to refer to parts of the house.&lt;ref&gt;http://kitlv.library.uu.nl/index.php/btlv/article/viewFile/1785/2546&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Savu music is based on the [[gong]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kab-kupang.go.id/tour/esabuculture.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and normally accompanies traditional dance. The Padoa dance is performed in a circle, holding hands, with dancers rotating their legs clockwise, wearing pedue (beans wrapped in palm leaf to create a rattle). The Ledo Hua dance is performed by mixed pairs, with the men wearing bells.

==Religion==
===Jingi Tiu===
The traditional religion of Savu is called Jingi Tiu.

Each of the domains of Savu was led by a Jingi Tiu Council of Priests.

Jingi Tiu is a polytheistic religion, with gods of earth, sea and sky, as well as many more minor spirits.

===Protestantism===
Evangelism began in 1854, and increased its impetus after 1861, when Esser, Dutch ''resident'' of [[Kupang]], called for schools and a Christian teacher from [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] in Savu.&lt;ref&gt;Catholics in Indonesia: 1808 - 1942 : a documented history&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, when the Indonesian encouraged people throughout Indonesia to adopt Islam or Christianity, Protestantism has been in the ascendancy, with 80% of Savu people now Protestan, and Jingi Tiu on the decline. Despite this, many aspects of Jingi Tiu belief still influence Christian worship in Savu.

==Occupation==
The traditional occupation of the Savu people is farming; where in some places [[irrigation system]] is used. Crops such as rice, corn, millet and beans are usually grown. The Savu people make sweet syrup and [[tuak|wine]] from the juice of a lone palm tree. Savu people also breed small cattle, buffaloes and horses, and practice [[cockfight]]s. Apart from that, they also engage in fishing. Weaving and braiding is considered as part of traditional crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Большой энциклопедический словарь, Volume 1|author=Александр Михайлович Прохоров|year=1991|publisher=Советская Энциклопедия|isbn=58-527-0015-0|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlements==
Their housing are framed columns with [[gable]] roofing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Living House: An Anthropology of Architecture in South-East Asia|author=Roxana Waterson|year=2012|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=14-629-0601-X|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional settlements are cumulus structured, with a temple and stone shrines in the center square, surrounded by stone walls. While the harvest is ripening, they would live in temporary huts in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Большой новейший справочник необходимых знани|author=А.П.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3396">'''Siddiqi''' ({{lang-ar|صدیقی}}) is a [[Muslim]] family name, found in the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]]. [[Sheikh]] is an additional title used occasionally by Siddiqis to signify noble [[Arab]] heritage. According to tradition, people having surname "Siddiqi" are offspring of [[Abu Bakr]] Siddique ({{lang-ar|ابو بكر الصديق}}), the first Khalifa ([[Caliph]]) and an early companion and friend of the Islamic [[prophet]], Muhammad.

==Distribution==
People claiming Siddiqi descent can be found in [[Djibouti]], [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]].

However, representatives in these countries are not referred to as Siddiqi, but are instead known by various local names. Siddiqis in [[Ogaden|Eastern Ethiopia]] are usually called [[Qallu]]. While some of them still speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]], most of them speak the regional [[Oromo language|Oromo]], [[Harari language|Harari]] or [[Somali language|Somali]] languages, tongues which, like Arabic, also belong to the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family. In Somalia, Siddiqis are commonly known as [[Sheekhaal]] or Aw-Qutub.

==Divisions==
Notable Siddiqi families in the Horn region include:

1. [[Kurtu]] family (in [[Harar]], [[Deder]] and [[Djibouti]])

2. [[Aw Barre]] family

3. [[Aw Ismael]] family

4. [[Qallu-Diinii]] family

5. [[Khabir Hassan]] family (in [[Gelemso]])

6. [[Aw Samirren]] family

7. [[Aw Khalaf]] family

8. [[Aw Umar Ziad]] family

9. [[Abogne]]/[[Abun]] (the Khalaf and [[Kurtu]] families; Harari genealogy)

==Common ancestor==
The Muslim cleric Sheikh [[Abadir Umar Ar-Rida]] (''Abadir Omar Al-Rida ibn Muhammad ibn Shamsadin Al-Bakri Al-Siddiqi'') is traditionally regarded as the common ancestor of the Siddiqi families in the Horn region. Ar-Rida is the main figure in the ''Fath Madinat Harar'', an unpublished history of the city of [[Harar]] in the 13th century. According to the account, Ar-Rida, along with several other [[saint]]s, came from the [[Hijaz]] region of present-day [[Saudi Arabia]] to Harar in 612H (1216 AD).&lt;ref name="Uhlig"&gt;Siegbert Uhlig, ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: He-N'', Volume 3, (Otto Harrassowitz Verlag: 2007), pp.111 &amp; 319.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sheikh is said to have then fathered six sons, whom the Siddiqis regard as their forebears.

Sheikh Ar-Rida's tomb is located inside the walled city. A few meters away, there is also a mosque that bears his name.

==Notable Siddiqis==
Notable Siddiqis include:

*[[Ahmad Taqi]] in Ethiopia.
*Dr. [[Ali Sheikh Ahmed]], the founder and president of [[Mogadishu University]] in [[Mogadishu]], Somalia. He is also president of Al-Islaah, which is part of the wider [[Muslim Brotherhood]] organization based in [[Egypt]].

'''Sub Rosa''' is the name of the [[New Zealand Intelligence Corps]] association. Its members are drawn from serving and retired members of the Corps and others that have served in intelligence positions in the [[New Zealand Defence Force]].

The phrase is [[Latin]] and means 'under the rose', because the rose was an emblem of secrecy hung above council tables and confessionals. The origin of which traces to a famous story in which [[Cupid]] gave [[Harpocrates]], the god of silence, a rose to bribe him not to betray the confidence of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. Hence the ceilings of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] banquet-rooms were decorated with roses to remind guests that what was spoken [[sub vino]] (under the influence of wine) was also sub rosa.

The emblem of Sub Rosa is a [[Tudor Rose]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3089">'''TatNet''' (short for "Tatar Internet") is the name Tatar-speaking Internet users commonly use for the segment of the Web about the [[Tatar]] people or [[Tatarstan]]. It includes [[webpages]] and [[websites]] in many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.interethnic.org/Ssilki/Tatnet.htm Tatar Internet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623005913/http://www.interethnic.org/Ssilki/Tatnet.htm |date=2008-06-23 }} Russian overview&lt;/ref&gt;

The first e-mail message in Tatar was probably sent and received in 1991 when employees of the Tatar-Bashkir Service of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] started using the [[Internet]] and electronic communication on a regular basis. In 1994, a Tatar-language mailing list (TMG, standing for Tatar Mailing Group) was established and this year is commonly regarded as the birthyear of the Tatar Internet. Since approximately 2000, Tatnet has been developing explosively, with many web pages and web sites added to it annually. The existence of Tatnet continues to contribute tremendously to the cohesion and consolidation of the Tatar people, a significant achievement because Tatars are dispersed all over the world and a substantial majority of Tatars live outside their ethnic homeland, Tatarstan. Tatar Internet users employ [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic]] scripts with the former gradually becoming more dominant.

The name TatNet is a portmanteau for "Tatar Internet", formed as analogue of the alike terms [[Runet]], [[Kaznet]], [[Uznet]] and others. TatNet gets some support from Tatarstan authorities, e. g. the Republic's Agency on mass communication (Tatmedia) helps with organizing of the annual website building contest "Stars of TatNet" ("Татнет йолдызлары").&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.tatar.ru/?DNSID=83336be96ad58102b27b5ec5b6f5b6d9&amp;full=29385 В Агентстве «Татмедиа» наградили победителей конкурса «Звезды Татнета-2007»] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030101628/http://www.tatar.ru/?DNSID=ae7cf428ce073a4ec817aef9be55e46a |date=2009-10-30 }} — official report on Tatnet Yoldyzlary award event&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.rt-online.ru/articles/37_24853/48113/ "Звезды Татнета"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722092319/http://www.rt-online.ru/articles/37_24853/48113/ |date=2011-07-22 }} - a 2003 Tatnet Yoldyzlary report by the "Republic of Tatarstan" national newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19775">The '''transmigration program''' ({{lang-id|{{italics correction|Transmigrasi}}}}, from [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''transmigratie'') was an initiative of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Dutch East Indies|colonial government]], and later continued by the [[government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]] to move landless people from densely populated areas of [[Indonesia]] to less populous areas of the country.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100604015847/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/02/govt-builds-transmigration-museum-lampung.html&lt;/ref&gt; This involved moving people permanently from the island of [[Java (island)|Java]], but also to a lesser extent from [[Bali]] and [[Madura Island|Madura]], to less densely populated areas including [[West Papua (region)|Papua]] (ended in 2015 by president [[Joko Widodo]]), [[Kalimantan]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Sulawesi]]. The stated purpose of this program was to reduce the considerable [[poverty]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] on Java, to provide opportunities for hard-working poor people, and to provide a [[workforce]] to better utilize the [[natural resource]]s of the outer islands. The program, however, has been controversial as fears from native populations of "[[Javanization]]" and "[[Islamization]]" have strengthened [[separatist]] movements and [[communal violence]].&lt;ref name="Anata"/&gt; The incomers are Madurese and Javanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Magdalena|first1=Federico V.|title=Islam and the Politics of Identity|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/cps/identity.html|website=University of Hawai'i at Manoā|publisher=Center for Philippine Studies|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Under the Dutch===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Javaanse koelies keren na werkzaamheden op Sumatra verricht te hebben terug naar Java TMnr 10001443.jpg|thumb|Javanese contract workers in plantation in Sumatra during [[Dutch East Indies|colonial period]], cirica 1925.]]
The policy was first initiated by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]] in the early nineteenth century to reduce crowding and to provide a workforce for plantations on [[Sumatra]]. The program diminished during the last years of the Dutch era (1940s) but was revived following Indonesian independence, in an attempt to alleviate the food shortages and weak economic performance during [[Sukarno]]'s presidency in the two decades following World War II.

In the peak year, 1929 in the Sumatra's east coast more than 260,000 contract workers were brought, 235,000 of them from Java. Workers entered into a contract as coolie; if a worker asked for the termination of the contract in the company ('desertion'), he could be punished with [[hard labor]]. The [[Mortality rate|mortality]] was very high among the coolies and abuse was common.

===Post-independence===
[[File:Impact of Javanese expansion on Dani tribe in Irian Jaya ABC 1995.webm|thumbnail|1995 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news report on the impact of transmigration on the Dani people in Papua]]
After independence in 1949, under [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]], the program continued and was expanded to send migrants to more areas of the archipelago such as [[Papua (province)|Papua]]. At its peak between 1979 and 1984, 535,000 families (almost 2.5 million people) moved under the transmigration program. It had a major impact on the demographics of some regions; for example, in 1981 sixty percent of the 3 million people in the southern Sumatra province of [[Lampung]] were transmigrants. During the 1980s, the program was funded by the [[World Bank]] and [[Asian Development Bank]] as well as by many [[Western world|Western]] governments who appreciated Suharto's [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imperial Nature: The World Bank and Struggles for Social Justice in the Age of Globalization |first=Michael |last=Goldman|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2006|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a result of the [[1979 energy crisis]] and increased transportation costs, the budget and plans for transmigration were severely reduced.&lt;ref name="Anata"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indonesian Crisis: A Human Development Perspective|first=Aris|last=Anata|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year=2003|pages=229–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2000, after the [[Asian financial crisis]] and the [[Fall of Suharto|fall of the Suharto regime]], the Indonesian government again reduced the scale of the transmigration program, due to a lack of funds.

Under the restructured Department of Manpower and Transmigration (Indonesian: ''Departemen Tenaga Kerja dan Transmigrasi'') the Indonesian government maintains the transmigration program, although on a far smaller scale than in previous decades. The department assists in annually relocating approximately 15,000 families, or nearly 60,000 people. The rate has shown gradual increases in recent years with funding for transmigration activities at $270 million (2.3 trillion [[Indonesian rupiah|IDR]]) and a target of relocating 20,500 families in 2006. The program has recently been abolished in 2015 by the new president Joko Widodo. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Almubarok I | first =Zaky | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Ditargetkan Transmigrasi 20.500 Keluarga (Target of 25,000 Families set for Transmigration) | work =Berita Ketransmigration (Transmigration News) | publisher =Departeman Tenaga Kerja dan Transmigrasi (Department of Manpower and Transmigration) | date =16 May 2006 | url =http://www.nakertrans.go.id/statistik_trans/KLIPING/Mei%20%2706/Kliping_Mei16a.php | format = | doi = | accessdate = | language =id | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927105018/http://www.nakertrans.go.id/statistik_trans/KLIPING/Mei%20'06/Kliping_Mei16a.php | archivedate =27 September 2007 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The stated purpose of the program, according to proponents in the Indonesian government and the [[economic development|development]] community, was to move millions of Indonesians from the densely populated inner islands of Java, Bali and Madura to the outer, less densely populated islands to achieve a more balanced [[population density]]. This would alleviate poverty by providing land and new opportunities to generate income for poor landless settlers. It would also benefit the nation as a whole by increasing the utilization of the natural resources of the less-populous islands. The program may have been intended to encourage the unification of the country through the creation of a single ''Indonesian'' [[national identity|national]] [[identity (social science)|identity]] to augment or replace regional identities. The official position of the Indonesian government is that there is no separation of "indigenous people" and settlers in Indonesia, because Indonesia is a country "of indigenous people, run and governed by and for indigenous people". It argues instead for the use of "vulnerable population groups" which can include both tribal groups and the urban poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Environmental Knowledge and its Transformations: Critical Anthropoligical Perspectives|first=Roy|last=Ellen|first2=Peter|last2=Parkes|first3=Alan|last3=Bicker|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|year=2000|pages=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

===Economic===
In many examples, the program failed in its objective to improve the situation of the migrants. The [[soil]] and [[climate]] of their new locations were generally not nearly as productive as the volcanic soil of Java and Bali. The settlers were often landless people lacking in farming skills, let alone skills appropriate to the new land, thus compromising their own chances of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =Max Sijabat  | first =Ridwan  | coauthors =  | title =Unemployment still blighting the Indonesian landscape  | work =  | pages =  | publisher =[[The Jakarta Post]]  | date =23 March 2007  | url =http://www.thejakartapost.com/review/nat05.asp  | accessdate =  | deadurl =yes  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070501081947/http://www.thejakartapost.com/review/nat05.asp  | archivedate =1 May 2007  | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===
Transmigration has also been blamed for accelerating the [[Deforestation in Indonesia|deforestation of sensitive rainforest areas]], as formerly sparsely-populated areas experienced great increases in population. Migrants were often moved to entirely new "transmigration villages," constructed in regions that had been relatively unimpacted by human activity. By settling on this land, [[natural resources]] were used up and the lands became [[overgrazed]], resulting in deforestation.

===Social and Political===
The program has resulted in communal clashes between ethnic groups that have come into contact through transmigration. For example, in 1999 the local Dayaks and Malays clashed against the transmigrant Madurese during the [[Sambas riots]] and the Dayaks and Madurese clashed again in 2001 during the [[Sampit conflict]], resulting in thousands of deaths and thousands of Madurese being displaced. Transmigration is controversial in the provinces of [[Papua (province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]], where the majority of the population is Christian. Some Papuans accuse the government of ''Islamisasi'', or [[Islamisation]] through transmigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christianity, Islam, and Nationalism in Indonesia|author=Farhadian, Charles E.|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2005|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figures==
Transmigration from Java and Madura have resulted in large numbers of the population elsewhere, particularly in [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]], and [[West Papua (region)|Papua]].
Based on 2010 census figures and ethnic prevalence, roughly 4.3 million transmigrants and their descendants live in North Sumatra, 200 thousand in West Sumatra, 1.4 million in Riau, almost a million in Jambi, 2.2 million in South Sumatra, 0.4 million in Bengkulu, 5.7 million in Lampung, 100 thousand in Bangka-Belitung, almost 400 thousand in Riau Islands, totaling some 15.5 million in Sumatra alone.  In Kalimantan there are some 700 thousand transmigrants and their descendants in West Kalimantan, 400 thousand in Central Kalimantan, almost 500 thousand in South Kalimantan, and over a million in East Kalimantan, totaling 2.6 million for the whole area.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  Though numbers are a state secret, well over a million transmigrants are thought to reside in Papua and West Papua.  Total Javanese and other transmigrants in Indonesia number roughly 20 million throughout the country.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Transmigrant are not exclusively ethnic Javanese and/or Muslims. For example, in 1994 when [[East Timor]] was still part of Indonesia, the largest transmigrant group was Hindu [[Balinese people|Balinese]] (1,634 people) followed by Catholic Javanese (1,212 people).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Criticism==
{{Criticism section|date=November 2012}}
Indigenous peoples saw the program as a part of an effort by the Java-based Indonesian Government to extend greater economic and political control over other regions, by moving in people with closer ties to Java and loyalty to the Indonesian state.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}  The government agencies responsible for administering transmigration were often accused of being insensitive to local customary or ''[[adat]]'' land rights.  This was especially true on Borneo with the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] population.

The environmental damage associated with these projects was caused less by ignorance than by inattention, poor follow-up, and lack of accountability during project implementation. Many environmental issues were identified at project appraisal: the potential for soil erosion, possibility of declining soil fertility, need for protection against pests and disease, possible adverse effects on wildlife and deforestation, impact on indigenous people, and the need to strengthen the borrower's capacity for managing natural resources. But often, the audits found, the proposed mitigatory measures were unrealistic or were insufficiently monitored by the government.

===Papua===
In the provinces of Papua and West Papua the program has resulted in the [[Papuan people|Melanesian population]] totaling less than the population of non-melanesian (principally Austronesian) origin. According to Papuan independence activists, the melanesians have lived on the island of New Guinea for an estimated 50,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Saltford, J; The United Nations and the Indonesian Takeover of West Papua, 1962-1969, Routledge Curzon, p.3, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; The West Papuans have been outnumbered in less than 50 years by Indonesian Muslims mostly from Java.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1196557/Transmigration_in_Indonesia_Lessons_from_its_environmental_and_social_impacts Transmigration in Indonesia: Lessons from Its Environmental and Social Impacts], Philip M Fearnside, Department of Ecology, National Institute for Research in the Amazon, 1997, Springer-Verlag New York Inc. Accessed online 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; They criticise the program as part of an attempt to wipe out the West Papuans in a slow-motion genocide.&lt;ref&gt;http://sydney.edu.au/arts/peace_conflict/docs/working_papers/West_Papuan_Demographics_in_2010_Census.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There is [[Papua conflict|open conflict]] between migrants, the state, and indigenous groups due to differences in culture—particularly in administration, and cultural topics such as nudity, food and sex.  Religion is also a problem as West Papuans are predominantly Christian or hold traditional tribal beliefs while the Indonesian settlers are Muslim. Indonesia has taken West Papuan children and sent them to Islamic religious schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/theyre-taking-our-children-20130503-2inhf.html They're taking our children: West Papua's youth are being removed to Islamic religious schools in Java for "re-education"], Michael Bachelard, Sydney Morning Herald, 4 May 2013, accessed 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; West Papuans have fled across the border to Papua New Guinea (PNG) where as of January 2013 about 8,000 refugees were stranded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unhcr.org.au/unhcr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=283:unhcr-and-png-to-sign-agreement-for-services-to-refugees-in-western-province&amp;catid=35:news-a-media&amp;Itemid=63 UN High Commission for Refugees] website. Accessed 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The recorded population growth rates in Papua are exceptionally high due to migration.

Detractors{{who|date=November 2014}} of the program argue that considerable resources have been wasted in settling people who have not been able to move beyond subsistence level, with extensive damage to the environment and deracination of tribal people.  However, very large scale American and Anglo-Australian strip mining contracts have been developed on the island (as well as other Indonesian islands).

Neighbouring power Australia has ignored or silenced the voices of Papuan independence activists in Australia out of concern for harming [[Australia–Indonesia relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Menetrey, T, PNG Section, Department of Foreign Affairs in Transmigration – Australia’s Policy, 19 November 1984, National Archives; also Cabinet Minute no. 9702, 11 August 1987, Submission no. 4956 Papua New Guinea Proposals on Australia/Papua New Guinea Relations, National Archives of Australia&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006 Indonesia recalled its ambassador to Australia for granting refugee visas to 42 West Papuans who fled in dugout canoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/jakarta-say-sorry-or-no-ambassador/2006/04/18/1145344085813.html Jakarta: Say sorry or no ambassador], Sydney Morning Herald, April 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Normal diplomatic relations did not resume until Australia signed the Lombok treaty&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/indonesia/ind-aus-sec06.html Lombok Treaty], Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&lt;/ref&gt; eight months later to muzzle independence movements in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2006/s1787869.htm Australia, Indonesia sign security pact], ABC radio transcript of AM broadcast 14 November 2006, retrieved 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Australia has continued to silence West Papuans with former Prime Minister Tony Abbott saying Australia will not "give people a platform to grandstand against Indonesia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/abbott-attacks-grandstanding-against-indonesia-by-protesters/1201206 Abbott attacks "grandstanding" against Indonesia by protesters], ABC Radio Australia, broadcast 8 October 2013, transcript retrieved 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Australia has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Papua New Guinea to enable West Papuans fleeing to Australia to be sent to Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S, [http://mams.rmit.edu.au/2leqc9idkov1.pdf The impact of Australian-Papua New Guinea border management co-operation on refugee protection;] Local-Global Journal, volume 8, 2010, RMIT University, Accessed 17 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vengo''', or '''''Babungos''''', are an ethnic group of about 14,000 people who are resident in the anglophone [[Northwest Province, Cameroon|Northwest Province]] of [[Cameroon]]. They live predominantly in the region of a village which is also called Vengo or "Babungo". This village is located in the Cameroonian Grassfields at the so-called "Ringroad", approximately 50&amp;nbsp;km West of the province's capital [[Bamenda]]. The language of the people is also called [[Vengo language|Vengo]] or "Babungo". For the tribe, village and language the spelling "'''Bamungo'''" is also often found.

In their own language, the Vengo call their village ''vengo'' {{IPA-xx|vəŋóo|}} and their language ''ghang vengo'' {{IPA-xx|ɣáŋ vəŋóo|}}; this is why the name of the tribe, village and language is officially also listed under the names "'''Vengo'''" or "'''Vengoo'''". Other alternative terms are: Vengi, Pengo, Ngo, Nguu, Ngwa, Nge.

'''Famous Vengo People
'''
According to Chique Magazine "Golden Globe nominated actor, Producer, Director and six-time winner of the NAACP Awards [[Blair Underwood]]'s ancestors are Vengo. In 2011, in an episode of the NBC show 'Who do you think you are?' Blair Underwood traced his ancestry to the Vengo people of the Cameroon in West Africa. He journeyed with his father to his ancestral homeland in Cameroon and reconnected with his family. In an emotionally laden voice, Blair said at the end of the show that, 'What I will share with my children is that we come from a long line of people from these valleys, to actually be able to travel all these long miles and to meet my cousins face to face, it feels like the family has come full circle to reunite a family that was broken. Voids were filled that I didn’t even realize that I had. For me, we are African not because we were born African but because Africa was born in us. Who I thought I was when we started this journey is different from who I know I am today. It has been incredible.'" &lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women's music''' (also '''womyn's music''' or '''wimmin's music''') is the music by women, for women, and about women.{{sfn|Lont|1992||p=242}} The genre emerged as a musical expression of the [[second-wave feminist]] movement{{sfn|Peraino|2001||p=693}} as well as the [[labour (economics)|labor]], [[civil rights]], and [[peace movement]]s.{{sfn|Mosbacher|2002|p=}} The movement (in the USA) was started by lesbian performers such as [[Cris Williamson]], [[Meg Christian]] and [[Margie Adam]], African-American musicians including [[Linda Tillery]], [[Mary Watkins]], Gwen Avery{{sfn|Hayes|2010|p=}} and activists such as [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]] and her group [[Sweet Honey in the Rock]], and peace activist [[Holly Near]].{{sfn|Mosbacher|2002|p=}} Women's music also refers to the wider industry of women's music that goes beyond the performing artists to include [[studio musicians]], [[Record producer|producers]], [[sound engineer]]s, [[technician]]s, cover artists, [[distributors]], [[promoter (entertainment)|promoters]], and festival organizers who are also women.{{sfn|Lont|1992||p=242}}

==History==
Early women’s music came in various forms, but each viewed music as something that expresses life. According to Ruth Solie, the origins of feminist music came from religion, where Goddess traditions expressed the inner lives of those who lived.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solie|first=Ruth A.|date=1993|title=Women's History and Music History: The Feminist Historiography of Sophie Drinker|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/363303/summary|journal=Journal of Women's History|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=8–31|doi=10.1353/jowh.2010.0261|issn=1527-2036}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also stated that this type of music has always been creatively challenging and that the changing cultural standards throughout the years made it difficult to create standards in production. Solie's research found that this early form of music wasn't near the artistic form of some of the more famous musicians, notably Beethoven and Bach,  and that this kind of feministic music was created to please the men and lived up to an entirely different standard of beauty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States, some people perceived&lt;ref&gt;Others disagree and highlight examples spanning all popular genres of music such as [[The Supremes]], [[The Mamas and the Papas]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], [[Billie Holiday]].&lt;/ref&gt; that there were few "positive women's images within popular music" and a "lack of opportunities for female performers" in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lont|1992|p=243}}; {{harvnb|Mosbacher|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They viewed women as having a disadvantage in the field because of their difference in gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Kate|title=Not Pretty Girls? Sexuality, Spirituality, and Gender Construction in Women's Rock Music|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|year=2006|volume=39 | issue = 1|pages=69–94|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2006.00204.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, major US [[record labels]] had only signed a few women's bands including [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]], [[Birtha (band)|Birtha]], [[The Deadly Nightshade]], [[Goldie and the Gingerbreads]] and the band that they evolved into, [[Isis (horn-rock band)|Isis]].{{sfn|Lont|1992||p=243}}  In reaction to this perceived lack of inclusion of women in the mainstream, some feminists decided it necessary for women to create a separate space for women to create music.  Lesbian and [[feminist separatism]] was then used as a "tactic which focused women's energy and would give an enormous boost to the growth and development of women's music."{{sfn|Lont|1992||p=244}}

Out of the separatist movement came the first distributed examples of music created specifically for lesbians or feminists. In 1972, [[Maxine Feldman]], who had been an "out" (openly gay) performer since 1964, recorded the first overtly lesbian record, "Angry Atthis" (Atthis was a lover of the Ancient Greek poet [[Sappho]]). Feldman had been performing the song since 1969, and its lyrics were specific to her feelings and experiences as a lesbian. In the same year the feminist all-woman bands [[Chicago and New Haven Women's Liberation Rock Bands|The Chicago Women's Liberation Rock Band]] and the [[Chicago and New Haven Women's Liberation Rock Bands|New Haven Women's Liberation Rock Band]] released ''Mountain Moving Day''. In 1973, [[Alix Dobkin]], [[flautist]] [[Kay Gardner (composer)|Kay Gardner]], and bassist Patches Attom created the group Lavender Jane, and recorded an album entitled ''Lavender Jane Loves Women,'' the first full-length album for and by lesbians. These early recordings relied on sales through mail order and in a few [[lesbian]]-[[feminist]] [[bookstores]], like [[Lambda Rising]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as promotion by word of mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lont|1992|p=}}; {{harvnb|Mosbacher|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1974, the women who would go on to form the first European women's rock band performed at a women's music festival in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title='Der' Kampf um die Träume: Musik, Gesellschaft und Veränderung|last=Sterneck|first=Wolfgang|publisher=KomistA|year=1998|isbn=3-928988-03-4|location=Hanau, Germany|pages=|language=German|trans-title=The Struggle for Dreams: Music, Society and Change|chapter=Das Zeichen Der Frau: Frauen und Lesbenmusik|trans-chapter=The Sign of the Woman: Women's and Lesbian Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formed the German women's rock band [[Flying Lesbians]] and released one self-titled album in 1975.

Goldenrod Music Distribution, founded by Terry Grant in 1975, has been credited by Lauron Kehrer as a major influence in the launch of the women’s music movement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kehrer|first=Lauron|date=2016-09-11|title=Goldenrod Distribution and the Queer Failure of Women's Music|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/629959|journal=American Music|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=218–242|issn=1945-2349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kehrer noted that although the organization was founded on the basis of helping women and lesbians, it was unable to work around the contradictions surrounding the company’s ethics{{Specify|reason=what were these contradictions?|date=June 2018}} and place in a capitalist society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Lesbians additionally found ways to express themselves through musical composition. There are common European classical semiotic codes that have been used throughout centuries to express either masculinity or femininity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sergeant|first=Desmond C.|last2=Himonides|first2=Evangelos|date=2016-03-31|title=Gender and Music Composition: A Study of Music, and the Gendering of Meanings |journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=7|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00411 |pmc=4815278|pmid=27065903}}&lt;/ref&gt; These musical gestures changed over time as the meaning of femininity changed, but they always kept to their purpose: truthful expressionism. Ethel Smyth, a musical composer, encoded her lesbian life experiences in her music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Genders of composers, writers, artists, and more have a lot to do with how music is perceived and interpreted. Cues such as tempo, articulation, and other dynamics signify many different types of meanings – they are not standard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each musician uses these codes and cues to suit their music, and thus express themselves through song.

Feminist musicians aimed to show a positive, proactive, and assertive image of women that not only critiqued the rifts in regards to gender, but also demonstrated the goals of the feminist movement such as social justices regarding gender as well as the right of privacy concerning abortion and birth control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Robin|title=Sex as a Weapon: Feminist Rock Music Videos|journal=NWSA Journal|year=1990|issue=2.1|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the goal of breaking down the gender divide and level the gender differences, some women in this genre of music "adopt[ed] male dress codes and hair styles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Kate|title=Not Pretty Girls?: Sexuality, Spirituality, and Gender Construction in Women's Rock Music|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|year=2006|volume=39 | issue = 1|pages=78|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2006.00204.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women also voiced their opinions and the goals of the feminist movement through lyrical contributions.  In "I Am Woman," [[Helen Reddy]] sings, "I am woman/hear me roar/And I've been down there on the floor/No one's ever gonna keep me down again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Kate|title=Not Pretty Girls?: Sexuality, Spirituality, and Gender Construction in Women's Rock Music|journal=The Journal of Popular Music|year=2006|issue=39.1|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reddy creates a feeling of "girl power" that reflected the ambitions of the feminist movement.

==Record labels, distributors, and publications==
[[Olivia Records]], the first women's music record label, was created in 1973 by a collective including artist [[Meg Christian]].  Starting with a single that was successfully sold by mail order, Olivia was able to release Meg Christian's ''I Know You Know'' and [[Cris Williamson]]'s ''The Changer and the Changed.''  ''The Changer and the Changed'' was "one of the all-time best selling albums on any independent label"{{sfn|Lont|1992||p=245}} at that time, and was also the first [[LP album|LP]] to be entirely produced by women.{{sfn|Koskoff|1989||p=208}} "Changer" is the all-time best-selling album to come out of the women's music genre.{{sfn|Koskoff|1989||p=208}}

Several other independent labels were created by artists such as Kay Gardner with the record label Wise Woman/Urana, [[Margie Adam]] with the record label Pleiades, [[Ani DiFranco]] with the record label Righteous Babe Records, and [[Holly Near]] with the record label Redwood Records in 1972.  Redwood records expanded the scope of women's music recordings to include women of color by recording [[Sweet Honey in the Rock]], an [[a cappella]] group of [[African-American]] singers founded by [[Bernice Reagon]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lont|1992|}}; {{harvnb|Koskoff|1989}}; {{harvnb|Carson et. al|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these record labels grew so did the music genres represented, and the ethnic and social diversity of the artists expanded. Several other labels were also formed by artists; [[Berkeley Women's Music Collective]], Woody Simmons, and [[Teresa Trull]] were distributed by Olivia through their network.

With the growth of independent record labels and increasing demand for women's music, an organized system for distribution and promotion became necessary.  Goldenrod Music was formed in 1975 to distribute for Olivia Records, and later expanded distribution to include other labels. [[Ladyslipper Records|Ladyslipper]], a [[non-profit organization]] formed in 1976 to promote and distribute women's music. Olivia's informal network formed WILD (Women's Independent Labels Distributors) in 1977 to distribute music into different regions of the United States.  The organization had two purposes - to formally network and educate distributors on sales and business issues, and to bargain with Olivia while Olivia's financial pressures in turn pressured the distributors. In 1978, a national booking company, Roadwork Inc. was formed to promote women artists.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lont|1992|}}; {{harvnb|Koskoff|1989}}; {{harvnb|Mosbacher|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All throughout the 1980s and 1990s, many women’s bookstores that sold women’s records relocated into smaller spaces or shut down. As a result, Olivia Records spread out to different industries to help its music projects become more profitable. With this expansion Olivia Records entered the travel industry, and [[Olivia Cruises and Resorts]] was founded in 1990. However, even with this expansion, sales in women’s music continued to decline dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;Mockus, Martha. "Radical Harmonies." Women &amp; Music 9 (2005): 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many social and economic components that caused the women’s music business to start failing in the 1980s and 1990s. In order to solve these different issues, the MIC (Music Industry Conference) came together to figure out what could be done. For an entire week around 80 women in the music business discussed the prevalent questions/concerns that were affecting women’s music at that time. The main topics at the conference were the drop in concert sizes, the unreal pay demands by the female performers, the lack of diversity in women artists, and how Olivia Records, which was initially intended to be a female ran company, was giving high positions to men.&lt;ref&gt;Tilchen, Maida. "A New Wave in Women's Music." Gay Community News Jun 23 1984: 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1984-1994, ''HOT WIRE: The Journal of Women's Music and Culture'' was created and published in Chicago by a large group of volunteers. It was founded by Toni Armstrong Jr., Ann Morris, Michele Gautreaux, and Yvonne Zipter. The publication focused exclusively on lesbian feminist musicians, festivals, venues, and various topics pertaining to writing, theater, dance, comedy, and the arts. ''HOT WIRE'' came out three times/year and each 64-page issue included a soundsheet with at least four songs by lesbian and/or feminist artists. It had international distribution and a website is in the works to provide downloadable articles from all of the back issues. Former editor Toni Armstrong Jr. has continued to be involved in women's music as a performer, concert producer, and currently edits the "Long Time Friends" e-newsletter "for veterans of the women's music industry." She currently resides in Florida and has founded an organization called BLAST (Bi, Lesbian, and Straight Together), which hosts events for, and about, women.

==Women's music festivals==
The first women's music festival occurred in 1973 at Sacramento State University. In May, 1974 the first National Women's Music Festival was held in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, founded by [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]] student Kristin Lems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=DIL19740326.2.55&amp;srpos=6&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-national+women%27s+music+festival------|title=UI grad student organizing national women's folk festival|last=Huttel|first=Richard|date=26 March 1974|work=The Daily Illini|access-date=8 May 2018|department=Features|pages=19, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It celebrated its fortieth year in Middleton, Wisconsin, from July 2–5, 2015. The [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]] was created in 1976, and became the largest festival in the United States{{sfn|Morris|1999|p=28}} before ceasing operations after the fortieth festival in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.advocate.com/michfest/2015/04/21/years-michigan-womyns-music-festival-will-be-last |title=This Year's Michigan Womyn's Music Festival Will Be the Last |publisher=The Advocate |author=Trudy Ring |date=2015-04-21 |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer festivals include [[Lilith Fair]] which toured from 1997–1999 and the Ohio Lesbian Festival, near Columbus Ohio, was created in 1988 and continues to be an ongoing celebration of womyn's music and culture. Many other festivals have been created throughout the United States and Canada since the mid-1970s and vary in size from a few hundred to thousands of attendees. The newest festival is the [[Los Angeles Women's Music Festival]], which kicked off in 2007 with over 2500 attendees, and which was originally scheduled to return in 2009, but has been on indefinite hiatus after the first event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawmf.com |title=Los Angeles Women's Music Festival |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015 |website=lawmf.com |access-date=2 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the festivals are centered on music, they support many other facets of lesbian and feminist culture.  Designed to provide a safe space for women's music and culture, many festivals are held on college campuses or in remote rural locations. Many festivals offer workshops on topics concerning the lesbian and feminist community, offer activities such as arts, crafts, fitness classes, and athletic events, and serve to provide opportunities for women to take advantage of resources they often cannot find in mainstream culture. One festival that provides such workshops is the National Women's Music Festival. In 1992, the festival provided workshops covering topics such as “drama”,” film and video,” “access-abilities,” “women’s health/sports and fitness,” “older women,” spirituality,” “women’s empowerment,” “women of color, and a writer's conference in addition to other topics in a "general workshop series."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Staggenborg|first=Suzanne|last2=Eder|first2=Donna|last3=Sudderth|first3=Lori|date=1993|title=Women's Culture and Social Change: Evidence from the National Women's Music Festival|jstor=41035465|journal=Berkeley Journal of Sociology|volume=38|pages=31–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonnie Morris describes in her book ''Eden Built by Eves'', how festivals serve women throughout the stages of their lives.  Festivals support a safe space for coming of age rituals for young women, adult romance and commitment ceremonies, the expression of alternative perspectives on motherhood, and the expression of grief and loss. {{sfn|Morris|1999}} The Michigan Womyen’s Music festival is an example of an environment that celebrates all women not just those who conform to mainstream media. Morris describes attendees at the festival as   "women who are sexy in wheelchairs, women who are sexy at 260 pounds, women who are sexy at age 70, long-term interracial romances - and all the rest of womenkind that television will not show or will tell us does not count."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=zrGa3vYOoZgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=women's+music+festivals&amp;ots=OVH6c4I1A-&amp;sig=OegSvrGUWqMOzfI35EbEjkvxVkA#v=onepage&amp;q=women's%20music%20festivals&amp;f=false|title=Music Scenes: Local, Translocal and Virtual|last=Bennett|first=Andy|last2=Peterson|first2=Richard A.|date=2004|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|isbn=9780826514516|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Festivals also help create a sense of community for the lesbian community. The National Women's Music Festival has in addition to the many lesbian participants and organizers, the festival's music, humor, and crafts promote a "positive lesbian identity." The festival has also been a place where women can openly display their sexuality including same-sex affections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eder|first=Donna|last2=Staggenborg|first2=Suzanne|last3=Sudderth|first3=Lori|date=January 1, 1995|title=THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S MUSIC FESTIVAL Collective Identity and Diversity in a Lesbian-Feminist Community|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/089124195023004004#articleCitationDownloadContainer|journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography|volume=23| issue =  4|pages=485–515|via=SAGE journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, festivals continue to thrive in the United States and other countries.

'''Workforce modeling''' is the process by which the need for skilled workers at a particular point in time (demand) is matched directly with the availability and preference of [[skilled workers]] (supply).  The resulting mathematical models may be used to perform [[sensitivity analysis]] and generate data output in the form of reports and schedules.

Due to the complexity level of building a workforce model, adoption of a workforce model is usually found in industries that have complex work rules, skilled or certified workers, medium to large teams of workers and fluctuating demand.  Some examples include [[healthcare]], [[public safety]], and retail.

A workforce modeling solution can also refer to software that effectively captures all the complexity of process from start to finish and delivers complete and correct results.  Components include:
*[[Demand management]] – tracking the demand for skilled workers by small units of time (generally 15 or 30 minutes)
*Employee availability – tracking of contractual work hour obligations and limits on an individual basis for each employee
*Employee preference – tracking of preferred times and dates that employees wish to work (used to help increase [[job satisfaction]])
*[[Workflow management]] – ability for the solution to automate normally manual processes such as requesting and approving time off, requesting shift swaps, and generating and posting schedules
*Optimization Engine – uses the mathematical model to create numerous schedules that are complete and correct and can be optimized on many dimensions simultaneously.  The most important are cost, [[overtime]] and [[employee satisfaction]]

==Definition==
For a more detailed definition, the term must be differentiated from traditional staff [[Schedule (workplace)|scheduling]]. Staff scheduling is rooted in [[time management]] and encompasses the mere administration of past and future working times. However, during the last ten to fifteen years, this traditional approach has evolved towards a demand-oriented solution which, under economic aspects, also includes changes in personnel requirements and objectives when optimizing the scheduling of staff. Besides the two core aspects of demand-orientation and optimization, workforce modeling also incorporates the forecast of the workload and the required staff, the integration of employees into the scheduling process through interactivity, the management of working times and accounts as well as analyzing and monitoring the entire process.

Workforce modeling solutions can, and should, be deployed enterprise-wide wherever complex scheduling needs or legal staffing ratios must be met.  Due to the complex nature of a workforce model, creating one by hand is nearly impossible.  By using a software solution for demand-oriented workforce management, planners can optimize staffing by creating schedules that at all times conform as closely as possible to the actual requirement. At the same time, a workforce modeling solution helps users to observe all relevant legislation, local agreements and the contracts with individual employees – including [[work-life balance]] guidelines.

==Complexity of model==
Many workforce modeling solution applications use the more common [[linear programming]] approach to create the Workforce Model. Linear methods of achieving a schedule are generally based on assumptions that demand is based on a series of independent events, all of which have a consistent, predictable outcome.&lt;ref name="Clancy, Thomas R. 2008"&gt;Clancy, Thomas R. ''Managing Organizational Complexity in Healthcare Operations.'' The Journal of Nursing Administration 38.9 (2008): 367-70. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this method is very common, the results are in most cases not as complete or efficient.  In general, they produce a resulting schedule that is up to 75% complete and leaves the scheduler to complete the remaining shift assignments.

[[Heuristics]] have been applied to the problem and [[metaheuristics]] has been identified as the best method for generating complex scheduling solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Edmund, Patrick De Causmaecker, Greet Vanden Berghe, and Hendrik Van Landeghem. ''[https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/123829/1/JOS_ The State of the Art of Nurse Rostering].'' Journal of Scheduling 7.6 (2004): 441-99. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this technique, many more solutions are available to the modeling process resulting in schedules that are not only closer to 100% complete, but are also optimized to many different criteria at the same time.&lt;ref name="Clancy, Thomas R. 2008"/&gt;
