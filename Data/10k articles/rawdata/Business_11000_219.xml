      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5494">'''Alexander Donald Cameron''' (21 July 1873 &amp;ndash; 23 January 1957) was a trader of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent who founded the [[Tonga Ma'a Tonga Kautaha]] (Tonga for Tongans Cooperative) in [[Tonga]] in 1909 to prevent the commercial exploitation of Tongan [[copra]] growers by [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] middlemen who controlled the market.

==Family and early life==
Cameron, born in [[Tottenham]], [[England]], was the second of eight children of a Scottish headmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite census | title =
Census | year =1881 | location =Tottenham, Middlesex, England | roll =RG11 | page =1381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an unsuccessful career in a tea company, first in [[London]] and then in [[Ceylon]], [[India]] and [[Australia]], he arrived in Tonga in 1901 as the branch manager of [[Sydney]]-based trading firm [[Burns Philp]].&lt;ref name=Lavaka&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lavaka |first=Penny |year=1981 |title=The Tonga Ma‘a Tonga Kautaha: A Watershed in British-Tongan Relations |journal=Pacific Studies |volume=4 |issue=2, Spring 1981 |publisher=Institute for Polynesian Studies |url=https://ojs.lib.byu.edu/spc/index.php/PacificStudies/article/viewFile/9209/8858 |access-date=2016-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201416/https://ojs.lib.byu.edu/spc/index.php/PacificStudies/article/viewFile/9209/8858 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, too, he was unsuccessful, soon being dismissed from the business, following which he took to drink and banished himself to a distant island for fifteen months to recuperate.&lt;ref name="Lavaka" /&gt; In 1903 he married Clara Elizabeth (Kelela) Cocker,&lt;ref&gt;"Australia Marriages, 1810-1980," database, FamilySearch(https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XTZC-PY4 : 12 December 2014), Alexander Donald Cameron and Clara Elizabeth Cocker, 27 Mar 1903; citing Launceston, Tasmania, Australia, reference 13; FHL microfilm 992,697.&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of a European trader and a Tongan woman and granddaughter of Joshua Cocker, who had been [[United Kingdom|British]] Vice-[[Consul]] of Tonga from May 1862 to August 1866. For a while he worked a commercial banana plantation on land belonging to his wife's family, but bankruptcy eventually brought an end to this enterprise.

==Tonga Ma'a Tonga Kautaha==
In 1909 Cameron devised the idea of a Tongan [[cooperative]] of copra growers called Tonga Ma'a Tonga Kautaha and with the support of a noble titleholder, Vaea of Hauma,&lt;ref name=Grijp&gt;{{cite book |last=van der Grijp |first=Paul |date=2014 |title=Manifestations of Mana: Political Power and Divine Inspiration in Polynesia |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=1Q2SAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Manifestations+of+mana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Manifestations%20of%20mana&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=LIT Verlag Münster |page=242 |isbn=978-3-643-90496-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; organised meetings in villages around [[Tongatapu]], the main island in the Kingdom of Tonga, to explain the concept, that in addition to providing growers with a more lucrative alternative to the European trader cartel for the export of their produce it would also serve as a vehicle for Tongan aspirations and the acquisition of business skills of non-indigenous residents.

Prior to the formation of Tonga Ma'a Tonga Kautaha, exporting of Tonga's copra crop had been under the control of European traders who benefited greatly from exceedingly high profit margins. They also controlled imports, often charging Tongans twice the price that they charged European residents.&lt;ref name="Lavaka" /&gt;

The Kautaha opened in May 1909 with 1,300 members and by later that year had 3,280 from all three main islands in the kingdom - Tongatapu, Vava’u and Ha’apai - including many of Tonga's most influential nobles and chiefs. According to Mateialona, the [[Premier]] of Tonga at that time, Cameron was spoken of generally among Kautaha members as “an angel descended from Heaven to deliver them from the bondage of the White traders.”&lt;ref name="Lavaka" /&gt;

Cameron's motivation was not solely benevolent. He earned a modest commission on sales which due to the large quantities of produce exported earned him between £1,300 to £1,500 during the first year of operation, contrasting starkly with his previous status as a bankrupt.

The cooperative drew the ire of the islands' European traders, who through the support of the local British Agent caused the collective to be investigated by the Auditor General and a report of the findings presented to its members, leading to its closure by Tonga's Premier on grounds of financial irregularities, for which Cameron was subsequently charged. On appeal, Cameron was acquitted of any wrongdoing and attempted to reform the collective, which was not successful and closed in about 1916, after which he relocated to Australia.

Cameron's venture had the unanticipated outcome of enhancing the nation's autonomy and significantly strengthening the authority of its [[monarch]], [[George Tupou II|King George Tupou II]], following Cameron's acquittal because of the heavy-handedness of William Telfer Campbell, the British Agent, regarding the investigation and in his dealings with the monarch, which led to a redefining of the role of his office in relation to advice given to the monarch.&lt;ref name="Lavaka" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grijp" /&gt;

'''Anthony Housefather''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|MP}} (born January 25, 1973) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|Member of Parliament]] representing the [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]] on the island of [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishtribune.ca/TribuneV2/index.php/201007143210/Saluting-human-rights-activists-for-oppressed-Jews-in-foreign-lands.html|title=Saluting human rights activists for oppressed Jews in foreign lands|last=Cohen|first=Mike|date=July 14, 2010|work=[[The Jewish Tribune (Canada)|Jewish Tribune]]|accessdate=November 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the Chairman of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights|Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Committees/en/JUST/Members|title=JUST - Members|website=www.parl.gc.ca|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was first elected to office in 1994 as a municipal councillor in the Town of [[Hampstead, Quebec|Hampstead]]. When Hampstead and all the other cities on the Montreal island were forced to merge into the City of Montreal by the [[Parti Québécois|Parti Quebecois]] government in 2001, he was elected as a municipal councilor in the borough of Côte-Saint-Luc-Hampstead-Montreal West. Housefather then led the demerger movement in his borough. Following the successful demerger of all three municipalities as determined in a referendum on June 20, 2004,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; he was elected Mayor of the City of [[Côte-Saint-Luc]], and served from 2005 until 2015, when he resigned following his election to Parliament.&lt;ref name="cotesaintluc.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cotesaintluc.org/formermayors|title=Former mayors and councillors {{!}} Côte Saint Luc, Quebec, Canada|website=www.cotesaintluc.org|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housefather was first elected to Parliament in the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|Canadian federal election of October 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/election-2015-mount-royal-libman-housefather-israel-1.3278806|title=Liberal Anthony Housefather dashes Conservatives' best hope for a Montreal seat|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 2016, Housefather was unanimously elected Chairman of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.

Housefather holds two law degrees (B.C.L. and LL.B.) from [[McGill University]], and an MBA from [[Concordia University]]'s [[John Molson School of Business]]. Before his election to federal office, he served as Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs and General Counsel, at [[Dialogic Corporation]], a multinational technology company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dialogic.com/en/company/executive-team/anthony-housefather.aspx|title=Anthony Housefather|work=dialogic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housefather was a nationally ranked athlete as a student. He returned to competitive swimming in 2010, and earned seven medals (two silver, and five bronze) in swimming masters events at the [[2013 Maccabiah Games]] in [[Israel]], and five at the [[2017 Maccabiah Games]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cotesaintluc.org/pr20130806a|title=Côte Saint-Luc swimmers shine at Maccabiah Games: Mayor Housefather wins seven medals {{!}} Côte Saint Luc, Quebec, Canada|website=www.cotesaintluc.org|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/six-jewish-mps-head-to-ottawa Here are the six Jewish MP's headed to Ottawa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Housefather was born in [[Montreal]], Canada, and is Jewish.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.maccabicanada.com/anthony-housefather-mp-maccabean-parliament/ Anthony Housefather, MP: The Maccabean of Parliament | Maccabi Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His grandparents were all born in Montreal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

He went to [[Herzliah High School]], and is fluent in Hebrew.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; He earned two law degrees (B.C.L. and LL.B.) from [[McGill University]], and an MBA from [[Concordia University]]'s [[John Molson School of Business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=47405431&amp;privcapId=2031090|title=Anthony Housefather: Executive Profile &amp; Biography - Businessweek|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liberal Party Vice President, and Hampstead Town Councillor (1991-2001)==
Housefather became active in the [[Mount Royal]] Liberal Association as a teenager. He was elected as Policy Vice President of the [[Young Liberals of Canada]]'s Quebec wing in 1991, and in 1992 was elected to the Liberal Party's national executive as Policy Vice President of the Young Liberals of Canada. In that role he worked on the platform committee for the development of the Red Book, the Liberal Party platform in the 1993 campaign.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

When his term on the national executive ended, Housefather ran for [[Hampstead]] Town Council and was elected in 1994, defeating two other candidates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magazine.concordia.ca/2008/fall/features/housefather.shtml|title=Improving society — Concordia University Magazine Features|website=magazine.concordia.ca|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected in 1998, and served in this capacity until 2001, when the Quebec government forced all cities and towns on the Island of [[Montreal]] to [[Montreal Merger|merge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/housefather-elected-liberal-candidate-in-mount-royal-riding|title=Montreal Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alliance Quebec President===
Housefather was  involved in organizations working on behalf of Quebec's English-speaking minority in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to being involved with [[Federation CJA]]'s Pro Montreal at its inception, he was also involved in the creation of Youth Employment Services. Both of these groups concentrated on keeping the youth of the English-speaking community in Quebec by helping them find jobs.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

He also served on the Board of Directors, and then as the Executive, of [[Alliance Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vigile.quebec/archives/AQ/index.html|title=Alliance-Québec|website=vigile.quebec|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housefather was elected President of Alliance Quebec in 2000 and served until 2001, when he ran for office in the new mega-city of Montreal following the forced mergers.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Councillor in the Mega-City, and Leader of the De-merger Movement (2001-05)==
Housefather, together with the vast majority of Mayors and Councillors of suburban municipalities, opposed the forced mergers which created the mega-city of Montreal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/quebecers-eager-to-break-up-mega-cities-in-june-referendums-1.478028|title=Quebecers eager to break up mega-cities in June referendums|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]]s ruled that the cities had no constitutional protection against the forced mergers, Housefather joined many suburban mayors and councillors who ran for election in the mega-city of Montreal, campaigning on the promise to support demerger if a new government ever permitted it. In the 2001 election, he  was elected as a Councillor for the Borough of [[Côte-Saint-Luc]]–Hampstead–[[Montreal West]], receiving approximately 70% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gjnashen.wordpress.com/2009/09/05/housefather-nashen-brownstein-and-kovac-announce-re-election-bid-for-2009/|title=Housefather, Nashen, Brownstein and Kovac Announce Re-Election Bid for 2009|date=2009-09-06|website=Nashen Notes|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Quebec Liberal Party]] was elected in 2003, it set in motion a process that permitted cities and towns to de-merge from the mega-city.  Housefather was alone amongst the three elected Councillors in Côte Saint-Luc-Hampstead-Montreal West to support the demerger of the three communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In 2004, he served as co-chair of the demerger committee of the Côte-Saint-Luc along with former City Councillors Mitchell Brownstein, Ruth Kovac, and Glenn J. Nashen. He was also a member of the Hampstead Demerger Committee and the Montreal West Demerger Committee. On June 20, 2004, all three communities voted to demerge from Montreal, with the Yes vote representing 91% of the votes cast in Hampstead, 87% of the votes cast in Côte Saint-Luc, and 84% of the votes cast in Montreal West.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/demerger-vote-will-change-map-of-quebec-1.472893|title=Demerger vote will change map of Quebec|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, all three municipalities were reconstituted within their former borders as of January 1, 2006, with elections scheduled for November 2005.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Mayor of Côte Saint-Luc (2005-15)==
On November 7, 2005, Housefather was elected Mayor of the reconstituted City of Côte-Saint-Luc, winning election with 75% of the vote while former Mayor [[Bernard Lang]] received 14% of the vote, and a third opponent receiving 10% of the vote.&lt;ref name="cotesaintluc.org"/&gt;

Housefather was a very popular and well-respected Mayor, and was re-elected by acclamation to a second term as Mayor of Côte-Saint-Luc on October 2, 2009, in advance of a November 1, 2009, vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cotesaintluc.org/ElectionResults|title=Municipal Election Results {{!}} Côte Saint Luc, Quebec, Canada|website=www.cotesaintluc.org|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was acclaimed again on October 4, 2013, in advance of a November 4, 2013, vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/westmount-ddo-csl-mayors-acclaimed-1.1485242|title=Westmount, DDO, CSL mayors acclaimed|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Mayor, Housefather was very involved in provincial as well as local issues. He led the fight by bilingual municipalities against the [[Parti Quebecois]]' government's Bill 14, which amongst other things would have deprived many Quebec municipalities of bilingual status. He drafted and presented a brief with [[Town of Mount Royal]] Mayor [[Philippe Roy]] at the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] on Bill 14 on March 11, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cotesaintluc.org/files/u1/council_minutes/2013/CSL_Council_Minutes_20130311_EN.pdf|title=MINUTES OF  THE  REGULAR  MEETING OF THE  CITY  COUNCIL  HELD  ON MONDAY, MARCH 11, 2013, AT 5801 CAVENDISH BOULEVARD, CÔTE SAINT-LUC, AT 8:00 P.M.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also held a rally at Côte Saint-Luc City Hall for religious tolerance, and led in the opposition to the PQ's Charter of Values which sought to bar any employee from wearing religious gear in schools, hospitals, municipalities and provincial government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cotesaintluc.org/news?page=7|title=News and announcements {{!}} Côte Saint Luc, Quebec, Canada|website=www.cotesaintluc.org|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these bills were dropped.

During the years when Côte Saint-Luc was in Montreal, a collective agreement was signed by the mega-city giving firefighters a monopoly on first response, which put Côte Saint-Luc's much valued Emergency Measures Service at risk of disappearing. With the help of [[D'Arcy-McGee]] MNA [[Lawrence Bergman]], Housefather was able to convince the Quebec Government to add a provision to Bill 22 to allow Côte Saint-Luc to operate its [[first responder|first-responder]] service permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gjnashen.wordpress.com/tag/bill-22/|title=Bill 22 {{!}} Nashen Notes|website=gjnashen.wordpress.com|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Housefather also was able to work with other mayors to save a local police station and to convince the Agglomeration of Montreal to adopt a resolution allocating $44 million for the Cavendish extension. He also worked with Councillor Dida Berku and environmental groups to help preserve the Meadowbrook Golf Vourse as a [[Urban open space|green space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cotesaintluc.org/pr20120601a|title=Councillor Berku receives Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal  {{!}} Côte Saint Luc, Quebec, Canada|website=www.cotesaintluc.org|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a local level, Housefather and his council were viewed as one of the most innovative councils in Quebec. Côte Saint-Luc built an $18 million Aquatic and Community Centre on time and under budget, and developed one of Montreal's leading aquatics programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cotesaintluc.org/pr20110404|title=Côte Saint-Luc hires Martin Levine as Aquatics Manager and Head Coach {{!}} Côte Saint Luc, Quebec, Canada|website=www.cotesaintluc.org|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Housefather administration, Côte Saint-Luc was the first city on the island of Montreal to launch a composting program for all single-family homes, the first to launch a food policy, and launched a farmer's market and community gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cotesaintluc.org/pr20130418a|title=Côte Saint-Luc launches first-in-Quebec urban agriculture initiative  {{!}} Côte Saint Luc, Quebec, Canada|website=www.cotesaintluc.org|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The median age of residents of the City of Côte Saint-Luc fell by seven years over Housefather's tenure as Mayor, as the community expanded high-quality programs for children and young adults and sponsored townhouses and other housing favourable to young families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=2466058&amp;Geo2=CD&amp;Code2=2466&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=cote&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom=&amp;TABID=1%20|title=Census Profile |last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But at the same time a permanent home was found for the City's seniors clubs and legion.

=== Island-wide roles ===
In addition to his duties within local government, between 2006 and 2015 Housefather also served as the Secretary of the Association of Suburban Municipalities (ASM), which represents the 15 demerged cities and towns on the Island of Montreal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cotesaintluc.org/files/u1/council_minutes/2014/CSL_council_minutes_20140811.pdf|title=MINUTES OF THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE CITY COUNCIL HELD ON MONDAY, AUGUST 11, 2014, AT 5801 CAVENDISH BOULEVARD, CÔTE SAINT-LUC, AT 8:00 P.M.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housefather was also a member of the island-wide Montreal [[Urban agglomeration of Montreal|agglomeration council]] and the [[Urban agglomerations in Quebec|agglomeration]]'s Public Security Commission.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Member of Parliament (2015-present)==
===Federal election (2015)===
When [[Liberal Party of Canada]] [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|MP]] [[Irwin Cotler]] announced he would not run in the [[42nd Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]] in the [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal riding]], Housefather was supported by most of the elected officials in the riding when he declared his intention to run.&lt;ref name="montrealgazette.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/housefather-elected-liberal-candidate-in-mount-royal-riding|title=Housefather elected Liberal candidate in Mount Royal riding|date=2014-12-01|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Liberal nomination opponent was communications strategist Jonathan Goldbloom. Housefather said his 20 successful years in municipal politics were excellent preparation for the role of MP. Over the course of the year he signed up over 3,000 residents of the riding to support him at the nominating meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/housefather-wins-mount-royal-liberal-nomination|title=Housefather wins Mount Royal Liberal nomination - The Canadian Jewish News|last=Reporter|first=Janice Arnold, Staff|date=2014-12-01|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mount Royal nomination meeting took place on November 30, 2014. With 1,948 ballots cast, Housefather was declared the winner and the official Liberal Party candidate for the 2015 federal election.&lt;ref name="montrealgazette.com"/&gt;

The Conservative Party targeted Mount Royal in the 2015 election, with Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] launching his party's campaign in Mount Royal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/5-reasons-stephen-harper-started-his-campaign-in-mont-royal-1.3175560|title=5 reasons Harper started his campaign in Montreal's Mont-Royal|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housefather ran a vigorous door-to-door campaign, and managed to assemble support from a wide variety of communities within the riding as well as the majority of elected officials at the municipal and [[school board]] election. Housefather and the [[New Democratic Party|NDP]] candidate debated four times in the riding, with the Conservative candidate participating in two of the debates and refusing two. However, Housefather debated against Conservative candidate [[Robert Libman]] on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[CKZW|Radio Shalom]], and all three candidates debated on [[CJAD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/29/mount-royal-anthony-housefather-robert-libman_n_8215344.html|title=Tory Vows To Take Liberal Stronghold Where Israel Remains A Key Issue|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the campaign, Housefather was elected as the Member of Parliament for Mount Royal on October 19, 2015, with 50.4% of the vote, and tripling the Liberal majority from the 2011 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2272005/liberal-anthony-housefather-elected-in-mount-royal/|title=Liberal Anthony Housefather elected in Mount Royal|last=Lau|first=Rachel|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housefather was profiled as one of 10 rookie MPs to watch in the new parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/nearly-200-rookie-mps-were-elected-in-election-2015-heres-who-to-watch|title=Nearly 200 rookie MPs were elected on Monday. Here's who to watch|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On Parliament Hill ===
On February 16, 2016, he was elected as Chairman the [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights|Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2521032/anthony-housefather-elected-chair-of-standing-committee-on-justice-and-human-rights/|title=Anthony Housefather elected chair of Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights|last=Lau|first=Rachel|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, Housefather earned international media attention for a speech he delivered in support of an anti-[[Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions]] (BDS) motion put forward in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Anthony Housefather|title=Anthony Housefather Supports Anti-BDS Motion in the House of Commons|date=2016-02-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3O6O0KhqnY|accessdate=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israellycool.com/2016/02/21/must-watch-canadian-parliamentarian-anthony-housefathers-masterful-ripping-of-bds/|title=MUST WATCH: Canadian Parliamentarian Anthony Housefather's Masterful Ripping Of BDS|last=Dave|first=Aussie|date=2016-02-21|website=Israellycool|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Anthony Housefather|title=Anthony Housefather Supports Anti-BDS Motion in the House of Commons|date=2016-02-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3O6O0KhqnY|accessdate=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion urged the government to reject the goals of the BDS movement. while calling on the government to "condemn any and all attempts by Canadian organizations, groups or individuals to promote [it] both here at home and abroad." Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] and most other Liberals voted in favour of the motion, which passed 229-51.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/anti-bds-motion-backed-by-liberals-tories-in-parliament|title=Anti-BDS motion backed by Liberals, Tories|last=Reporter|first=Paul Lungen, Staff|date=2016-02-19|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 2015, Housefather echoed Foreign Minister [[Stéphane Dion]]`s criticism of the [[UN Human Rights Council]]`s decision to appoint [[University of Western Ontario]] law professor Michael Lynk as its [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on human rights in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ahousefather/status/713139254814195712|title=Anthony Housefather on Twitter|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed criticism from Jewish groups including the [[Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs]], which accused Lynk of bias against Israel.

Housefather received considerable acclaim for his chairing of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, with committee members from all parties praising his handling of the difficult committee hearings on the [[assisted dying]] bill C-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hilltimes.com/2016/04/25/committee-chair-vows-not-to-impose-personal-views-in-handling-of-assisted-dying-law/59544|title=The Hill Times|website=www.hilltimes.com|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 20, 2016, no rookie Liberal MP had spoken more in the House of Commons than Housefather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://site.macleans.ca/interactives/ic2/|title=Figures of Speech|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the riding ===
In February 2016, Housefather relayed the support of the constituents in his [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] for the Cavendish Boulevard extension between Côte St. Luc and [[Saint-Laurent, Quebec|St. Laurent]] in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesuburban.com/news/city_news/housefather-advocates-for-cavendish-link-in-commons/article_614232e0-a345-5ee8-92ec-7f02da2f6a4f.html|title=Housefather advocates for Cavendish link in Commons|last=Suburban|first=Joel Goldenberg The|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Quebec Liberals adopted a resolution calling for the Cavendish extension to be realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesuburban.com/news/city_news/quebec-liberals-call-for-cavendish-extension/article_8f344981-9688-502d-a880-54f2cc4ae664.html|title=Quebec Liberals call for Cavendish extension|last=Suburban|first=Joel Goldenberg The|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Housefather and [[Minister of Families, Children and Social Development]]  [[Jean-Yves Duclos]] announced the federal government would provide $390,913 over a period of three years for a new drop-in centre, which provides relief for caregivers of seniors, at the Côte St. Luc Aquatic and Community Centre as part of the New Horizons for Seniors Program.&lt;ref name="Suburban"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesuburban.com/news/city_news/feds-announce-funding-for-new-csl-based-seniors-drop-in/article_f1572023-a52f-592c-8576-5c54910d0340.html|title=Feds announce funding for new CSL-based seniors drop-in centre|last=Suburban|first=Joel Goldenberg The|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total $1.1 million was received for senior programs assisting caregivers in the riding.&lt;ref name="Suburban"/&gt;

In May, Housefather announced that over 270 summer jobs had been created for students in the riding, with more than double the number of jobs created than in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesuburban.com/news/city_news/federal-program-provides-summer-jobs-in-mount-royal/article_485b6cca-a269-5e09-9eab-b0fa39459b1a.html|title=Federal program provides 270 summer jobs in Mount Royal|last=Suburban|first=Joel Goldenberg The|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the election campaign, Housefather had promised to hold quarterly [[town hall meeting]]s in the riding to give constituents a report on what is happening in Ottawa and in the riding and to take questions as he did as Mayor. The first town hall meeting was held in [[Hampstead]] in January and the second was held in the Town of Mount Royal in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hampstead.qc.ca/inside_town_hall/news/pre_budget_consultation_meeting|title=Town of Hampstead|website=www.hampstead.qc.ca|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The meetings are called Anthony's Assemblies.

=== In the media ===
Housefather has written several opinion pieces for Canadian newspapers, and has been interviewed on local and national news networks, sharing his views on subjects including his experience as a member of parliament, [[minority language]] issues, and his support of more permissive [[surrogacy]] laws in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/anthony-housefather-a-week-in-the-life-of-a-rookie-mp|title=Anthony Housefather: A week in the life of a rookie MP|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2016/04/20/paying-for-sperm-should-not-be-illegal.html|title=Paying for sperm should not be illegal {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-lets-change-laws-that-prevent-some-canadians-from-becoming-parents|title=Opinion: Let's change laws that prevent some Canadians from becoming parents|date=2016-03-08|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Arab Organization for Industrialization''''' (AOI) (''{{lang-ar|الهيئة العربية للتصنيع}}'') is an [[Egypt]]-based [[Military of the Arab League|Arab military]] organization established in 1975 by Egypt, The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, The [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) and Qatar state to supervise the collective development of the Arab [[defence industry|defense industry]]. Following a gradual deterioration in relations between the AOI member-states, Egypt became sole owner of AOI in 1993. As well as meeting the requirements of the [[Egyptian Armed Forces|Egyptian military]], AOI directs spare capacity to civilian programmed, including civilian transport and [[sanitation]] equipment, AOI has stated its intention of entering the [[wind power]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Initially an institution of [[Pan-Arabism]], Saudi Arabia and the [[United Arab Emirates]] returned their shares in AOI, valued at US$1.8 billion, to [[Egypt]] in 1993, leaving AOI wholly owned by the Egypt. AOI has approximately 16,000 employees,&lt;ref name="AOI" /&gt; out of which 1,250 are engineers. AOI fully owns 12 factories and shares in 1 joint-ventures, besides the Arab Institute for Development Technology.

==History==
{{Life in the Arab League}}
AOI was established by its four member-states - Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - in response to the threat posed by the advanced [[Military equipment of Israel|Israeli defence industry]].&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt; The initial [[Market capitalization|capitalisation]] of AOI was USD 1 billion, contributed in equal part by the four member-states, although with the understanding AOI would be based in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Shidlo 1993: 241&lt;/ref&gt;

===Westland Helicopters v. Arab Organisation for Industrialization===
In 1978, AOI and [[Westland Helicopters]], a British [[aerospace]] company, established the ''[[Arab British Helicopter Company]]'' as a joint venture, but a year later AOI announced the company's [[liquidation]]. In ensuing [[arbitration]], the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] made an [[Arbitration award|award]], on grounds of breach of the principles of [[natural law]] and [[good faith]], in favour of Westland Helicopters and against AOI's four member-states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

===Egyptian isolation===
Following the signing of the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|Egypt-Israeli peace treaty]] (1979), Egypt had its membership to the [[Arab League]] suspended and a policy of economic isolation implemented against it. It was in this atmosphere that the three AOI member-states other than Egypt - Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - withdrew from the AOI, causing its collapse.&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;German and Taylor 2004: 322&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the Egyptian [[Chief of staff|chief-of-staff]] restated his interest in the joint manufacture of weapons, but it was only after the [[1987 Arab League summit]] in [[Amman]], Jordan, when the Arab League re-admitted Egypt and the other Arab states normalised relations with Egypt, that the possibility of renewed co-operation among the AOI member-states seemed possible.&lt;ref&gt;German and Taylor 2004: 329&lt;/ref&gt;

The UAE seemed similarly eager to reinvigorate the AOI:&lt;ref&gt;Nolan 1992: 72&lt;/ref&gt; in 1988, Egypt and the UAE held talks with Qatar about its re-entry into the AOI, at which an agreement for closer co-operation between Egypt and Qatar in the fields of culture and communication was signed.&lt;ref&gt;Rabi 1990: 458&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
AOI is one of the largest [[Economy of Egypt#Industrial sector|industrial organisations in Egypt]]&lt;ref name="AOI"/&gt; with significant international relationships both in the [[Defence industry|defence]] and civilian transport sectors.&lt;ref name="AOI"/&gt; The AOI is wholly [[State ownership|state-owned]] by Egypt and administered by a ''Supreme Committee'', the chairman of which is the  [[President of Egypt|Egyptian president]] and which includes several [[Cabinet of Egypt|cabinet ministers]],&lt;ref name="AOI"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not a division of the ''[[Egyptian Military Industry|Ministry of Military Production]]'' as the treaty upon which it was established declares the Arab Organization for Industrialization as an independent international Organisation, even though it is now only owned by Egypt but the establishing treaty stays the same, and changing it requires the consent of the establishing parties .&lt;ref&gt;Cordesman 2002: 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current enterprises==
All AOI enterprises are [[ISO 9000|ISO 9000/2001]] and [[ISO 14000#ISO 14001|ISO 14001/2004]] certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===AOI Aircraft Factory===
[[File:HA-300 side.jpg|thumb|right|[[prototype]] [[Helwan HA-300]] manufactured at the AOI Aircraft Factory, for which the AOI Engine Factory produced E-300 engines.]]
The AOI's ''Aircraft Factory'' ({{lang-ar|مصنع الطائرات}}, abbreviated ''ACF'') was established in 1950 as Helwan Aircraft Factory and is a key [[aerospace manufacturer]] in Egypt.&lt;ref name="AOIAF"&gt;{{cite web

The AOI Aircraft Factory manufactures and assembles aircraft for the [[Egyptian Air Force|Egyptian air force]], including:

* [[Hispano HA-200|Helwan HA-200 Al Kahirah]] [[Subsonic aircraft|subsonic]] [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]]
* [[Prototype]] [[Helwan HA-300]] [[Supersonic aircraft|supersonic]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]
* [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha Jet]]
* [[Embraer EMB 312 Tucano|Tucano]] [[turboprop]] trainer
* the [[Hongdu JL-8|K-8E]] jet trainer.&lt;ref name="AOIAF"/&gt;

The K-8E is an Egyptian variant of the Chinese Hongdu JL-8, exported as the Karakorum-8 (or K-8) to (among others) [[Pakistan]], Zambia and [[Myanmar]].  The K-8E's manufacture at the AOI Aircraft Factory began in 2000, under an agreement between the AOI and [[China National Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export Corporation|CATIC]], the Chinese state-owned aerospace manufacturer, to produce a total of 60&amp;nbsp;K-8s over five years.  The contract, valued at US$347.4 million, was signed in 1999 in connection with the [[state visit]] by [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese president]] [[Jiang Zemin]] that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the end, 98% of each K-8E was locally manufactured.&lt;ref name="AOIAF"/&gt;

The AOI Aircraft Factory also manufactures [[aircraft part]]s for the [[Ministry of Civil Aviation (Egypt)|Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority]] (ECAA), [[Dassault Aviation]] and [[SAGEM]], and has received certification from the ECAA for its [[welding]], painting, testing and [[calibration]] operations.&lt;ref name="AOIAF"/&gt;  The AOI Aircraft Factory also engages in civilian and technological projects.

===AOI Engine Factory===
In 1960, the ''Engine Factory'' ({{lang-ar|مصنع المحركات}}) was established by the [[Egyptian Armed Forces|Egyptian military]] with German technical assistance as a base to design, develop and produce [[aircraft engine]]s.&lt;ref name="EF"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The first engines produced at the Engine Factory were:

* the E-200 for the Helwan HA-200 Al Kahirah subsonic trainer; and
* the E-300 for the Helwan HA-300 supersonic fighter.&lt;ref name="EF"/&gt;

In 1975, the Engine Factory was affiliated to AOI, since when it has focused its activities on the manufacture, assembly, repair and overhaul of [[gas turbine]]s and accessories. The AOI Engine Factory has established maintenance facilities for [[auxiliary power unit]]s  and [[SNECMA Atar#Atar 08 and 09|SNECMA Atar 09C]], [[Allison T56|T56]], [[General Electric T64#Versions|CT64]], [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6#PT6A|PT6]]-25 and -64, [[SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac|Larzac 04]], [[Tumansky R-13|R-13]] and [[Tumansky R-25|R-25]] engines.&lt;ref name="EF"/&gt;

The AOI Engine Factory directs spare capacity to civilian projects, including the manufacture of [[Fuel injection|fuel injectors]] for [[Robert Bosch GmbH]], [[Railway air brake|air brake systems]] for [[Knorr-Bremse]] and [[Rail fastening system#Clips|rail fastening clips]] for [[Pandrol]].&lt;ref name="EF"/&gt;

'''Aurora Fashions''' was a [[holding company]] of several retail fashion brands, formed in 2009 to purchase a number of businesses from the collapsed [[Mosaic Fashions]]. The company operates over 1250 stores in 38 countries, including franchises, under the Oasis, Warehouse and [[Coast (clothing)|Coast]] brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holland|first1=Tiffany|title=Aurora Fashions to be broken up in radical restructure|url=http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/fashion/aurora-fashions-to-be-broken-up-in-radical-restructure/5047015.article|accessdate=31 December 2014|work=Retail Week|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the company announced plans to spin-off [[Karen Millen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/fashion/aurora-fashions-to-spin-off-karen-millen/5023002.article |title=Aurora Fashions to spin off Karen Millen |last=Rushton |first=Katherine |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=Retail Week |accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was completed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruddick|first1=Graham|title=Aurora moves closer to break-up as Karen Millen boss departs|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11319553/Aurora-moves-closer-to-break-up-as-Karen-Millen-boss-departs.html|accessdate=5 September 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Millen was separated from the group to be owned by Aurora's parent [[Kaupthing Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Charlie|title=Mixed trading conditions for Aurora Fashions|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/mixed-trading-conditions-for-aurora-fashions-1.2497110|accessdate=8 March 2016|work=The Irish Times|date=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurora announced further plans in March 2013 for a wider restructuring. As part of this, Coast was also separated from the rest of the group, under the ownership of Kaupthing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Butler|first1=Sarah|title=Kate Bostock to head up Coast|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/20/kate-bostock-coast|accessdate=31 December 2014|work=The Guardian|date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was planned that Oasis and Warehouse would be merged under a new single parent company, Fresh Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Gemma|title=Aurora Fashions to restructure business|url=http://www.retailgazette.co.uk/articles/30324-aurora-fashions-to-restructure-business|accessdate=31 December 2014|work=Retail Gazette|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Losses widen at fashion giant|url=http://www.insidermedia.com/insider/national/133023-losses-widen-fashion-giant/|accessdate=5 September 2015|work=Insider Media|date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two brands were eventually demerged as the Oasis and Warehouse Group, led by Liz Evans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neville|first1=Simon|title=Oasis: Fashion brand turns profit for first time in three years as it goes upmarket|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/oasis-fashion-brand-turns-profit-for-first-time-in-three-years-as-it-goes-upmarket-a6750846.html|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=The Independent|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Philip|title=Oasis carries Warehouse as group turns profit|url=http://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2015/11/oasis-carries-warehouse-as-group-turns-profit|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=Retail Gazette|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Basil Zaharoff''', [[Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Order of the British Empire|GBE]] ({{lang-el|Βασίλειος Zαχαρίας Ζαχάρωφ}}; October 6, 1849 – November 27, 1936), was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[munitions|arms]] [[Arms dealer|dealer]] and [[industrialist]]. One of the richest men in the world during his lifetime, Zaharoff was described as a "merchant of death" and "mystery man of Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/655380/Sir-Basil-Zaharoff www.britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-mysterious-mr-zedzed-the-wickedest-man-in-the-world-97435790/?no-ist www.smithsonianmag.com]&lt;/ref&gt; His success was forged through his cunning, often aggressive and sharp business tactics. These included the sale of arms to opposing sides in conflicts, sometimes delivering fake or faulty machinery.

==Early life==
Basileios Zacharias was the son and eldest of four children of a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[merchant]], born in the [[Ottoman Empire]] town of [[Muğla]]. His family adopted the surname Zaharoff when they lived in [[Russia]], as exiles following the anti-Greek "Easter pogroms" of 1821. The family returned to the Ottoman Empire in the 1840s and, by 1855, had returned to [[Constantinople]]'s Greek neighbourhood of [[Tatavla]].
 
Basileios' first job was as a [[tour guide]] in the [[Galata]]. It is thought he became an [[Firefighter arson|arsonist]] with the Istanbul firefighters: on payment 19th-century firemen in Istanbul recovered or salvaged treasures for their wealthy owners.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Zaharoff was summoned to court in [[London]] due to irregular exports of goods from Istanbul to London. The London [[Greeks]] from [[Constantinople]] preferred disputes involving members of their community to be settled outside English courts, and he was discharged on the conditions that he paid £100 restitution to the claimant and remained within the court's jurisdiction. He immediately left for [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], where the 24-year-old Zaharoff was befriended by a [[political journalist]], [[Etienne Skouloudis]]. The eloquent Zaharoff succeeded in convincing Skouloudis of the rightness of his London court case.

By a stroke of good fortune, Skouloudis was a friend of a Swedish captain, who was about to leave his job as an agent of arms manufacturer [[Thorsten Nordenfelt]]. Skouloudis used his influence to recommend Zaharoff for the role. Zaharoff was hired on October 14, 1877, beginning a spectacular career. The political and military instability in the [[Balkan states]], Turkey and Russia provided an excellent opportunity for the arms sales, as each state spent to match the perceived aggressive intentions of its neighbours, even after the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|1878 Treaty of Berlin]].

==Arms dealing==
Zaharoff did not make arms dealing his sole business at first. After [[Cyprus]] passed under British control in 1878 he seems to have slipped back into Britain; by 1883 he was working as a shipping agent in Galway, Ireland, where he recruited local girls for work in American factories. He also had a spell in the United States where he worked as a confidence man, and later as a salesman for a St. Louis railcar business. In 1885, posing as "Prince Zacharias Basileus Zacharoff", he married a Philadelphia heiress, Jennie Billings, and was pursued to Rotterdam by detectives after his exposure as a bigamist by an Englishman who recognised him as the same man who had married an English girl in Bristol in 1872.&lt;ref name="Dash"&gt;Mike Dash, "The Mysterious Mr. Zedzed, the Wickedest Man in the World." [https://mikedashhistory.com/2012/02/16/the-mysterious-mr-zedzed-the-wickedest-man-in-the-world// A Blast From the Past, 16 February 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaharoff sold munitions to many nations, including [[Great Britain]], [[Germany]], the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s, [[Greece]], [[Spain]], [[Japan]] and the [[United States]]. Despite his reputation for corruption, he was instrumental in marketing military equipment, including various famous weapons such as the [[Maxim gun]] (one of the first fully automatic machine guns) and the first working [[submarine]]. The British-Swedish Nordenfelt produced a range of anti-torpedoboat guns in [[Erith]], [[Kent]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Spain]].

Zaharoff worked for [[Vickers Limited|Vickers]], the [[munitions]] firm, from 1897 to 1927.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38270 ''Zaharoff, Basil (1849–1936)'' (accessed November 29, 2010)].

===Maxim's machine gun===
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2018}}
[[Hiram Maxim]]'s [[Maxim gun|automatic machine gun]] was a significant improvement over the then-current hand-cranked models. Maxim's gun was better than anything that Nordenfelt sold at the time. Zaharoff is believed to have had a hand in the events surrounding Maxim's attempts to demonstrate his invention between 1886 and 1888. In the first, Maxim's and Nordenfelt's machine guns were to be demonstrated at [[La Spezia]], [[Italy]], before a distinguished audience which included the [[Prince Thomas, Duke of Genoa|Duke of Genoa]]. Maxim's representatives did not show up; a person unknown had waylaid them with a tour of [[La Spezia]]'s nocturnal establishments leaving them unfit for purpose the next morning.

Round 2 took place at [[Vienna]], where the exhibitors were instructed to modify their weapons to comply with [[Austria]]n Infantry-standard sized cartridges. After shooting a few hundred rounds, the [[Maxim gun]] became erratic before stopping altogether. When Maxim took one weapon apart to see what had happened, he discovered that they had been sabotaged, but it was too late to repair. A third demonstration also took place in Vienna, and here the gun worked perfectly. But again an unknown person went through the gathering of senior officers, convincing them that the workmanship required to produce such a marvellous weapon could only be done by hand, one at a time, and that without the means for mass production, Maxim could never produce machine guns in sufficient quantities to satisfy the needs of a modern army. Nordenfelt and Zaharoff had won. Maxim, who knew he had a good product, successfully sought a merger with Nordenfelt, engaging Zaharoff as their principal salesman on a huge commission.

Under pressure from [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild]] and [[Vickers]], Thorsten Nordenfelt merged with [[Hiram Maxim|Maxim]]'s in 1888 to form the [[Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company]]. Two years later, a bankrupt Nordenfelt was forced out of the company.

===Corrupt business tactics===
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2016}}
From 1886 to 1889, at the same time that Zaharoff got the Maxim machine gun, he managed to appropriate [[Isaac Peral]]'s submarine; although these facts are less well known. Zaharoff and Nordenfelt tried at this time to develop a submarine for their own business purposes.

One of the most notorious sales by Zaharoff was that of the ''Nordenfelt I'', a faulty steam-driven submarine model based on a design by the English inventor and clergyman [[George Garrett (inventor)|George Garrett]], which US Navy intelligence characterized as capable of "dangerous and eccentric movements." Thorsten Nordenfelt had already demonstrated his vessel at an international gathering of the military elite, and whilst the major powers would have none of it, smaller nations, attracted by the prestige, were a different matter.

It was thus that, with a promise of generous payment terms, Zaharoff sold the first model to the Greeks. He then convinced the Turks that the Greek submarine posed a threat, selling them two. After that, he persuaded the Russians that there was now a new and significant threat on the Black Sea, and they bought another two.

None of these submarines ever saw action. The mechanics, driven by steam propulsion, were completely inadequate for underwater navigation, and failed demonstrably when undergoing sea trials by the respective Navies.
Besides the underlying problems of the faulty propulsion system, they were also chronically unstable. One of the Turkish Navy's submarines sank, capsizing during a [[torpedo]] firing test. The vessel reared in a vertical position, from which it sank by the stern.

At this time Spanish inventor [[Isaac Peral]] designed and built the first submarine capable of navigating underwater with a decent level of control and with the ability to launch torpedoes both submerged and on the surface. This was the first proper submarine, solving the problems of propulsion, stability and armament all at once. Peral's submarine was driven by electric propulsion, and had a periscope, target practice apparatus, compensating [[compass]] needle, [[gyroscope]], sliding electric torpedo tube launcher and [[servomotor]] (to maintain the stability and the trim of the ship in all circumstances).

Zaharoff found out within no time about this young Spanish Naval officer's invention. Previously in shipbuilding, he had already seen the plans and memorandum reports sent by Peral to the Spanish Navy's HQ at the Defence Ministry.

Later on, during Peral's visit to London, Zaharoff tried meeting with him unsuccessfully, with the help of one of Peral's Spanish Navy fellow officers. Peral refused twice, but after several attempts, he had a meeting with Thorsten Nordenfelt, the company owner, who offered him a deal to purchase the patent of the stability servomotor. Isaac Peral rejected both offers but signed his sentence in that same instant, without knowing it.

Zaharoff then got to work with his own Machiavellian plan. The Spanish inventor, as with Maxim, suffered four sabotages during the tests: the first of them, in the previous test, in the presence of the Head of the Spanish State, but, Peral, more cautious than the North American inventor, proved successful in all of them.

Despite this, Zaharoff used underhand methods, which came to light later, and was able to cause a controversy between the inventor and his own government leading to the Spanish Government's disapproval of this submarine invention, although it would have been a formidable weapon in the conflict with the United States, several years after.

Zaharoff traveled to Spain several times between 1886 and 1890 with three objectives: boycott Peral's submarine, sell weapons to the Spanish Army, and acquire a Spanish munitions factory. He was successful in all three objectives, mainly because his initiation of an amorous relationship with Pilar de Muguiro y Beruete opened many doors for him.

Pilar's father, influential banker Fermín Muguiro, Count of Muguiro, was a close friend of the King, and leader of Spanish Conservative Party. She was a personal friend and niece of [[Segismundo Moret]], a leading Spanish progressive thinker and the Liberal Party Leader's right-hand man. Unhappily married to King Alfonso XII's cousin, the Spanish Grandee, Francisco de Borbón, Duke of Marchena, she had unrestricted access to the Royal Palaces. During one trip, Zaharoff was spotted at the shipyard where the Spanish submarine was being built, but the Spanish authorities "covered up" the matter.

The acquisition of one of the best Spanish armament companies, [[Euskalduna]], located in north Spain and renamed “[[Soraluze-Placencia de las Armas|Placencia de las Armas Co. Ltd]]” was in large part thanks to his love affair (later attributing his professional success to his sexual prowess), and through establishing a powerful network among Spanish politicians, journalists and military commanders, who served his business interests well. This influential group of people took his side against the development of Isaac Peral's submarine, and the Spanish Government, despite the astounding success in sea trials, finally pulled the rug from the project.

After “Placencia de Armas Co. Ltd” swindled the Spanish Government by selling useless arms during the 1898 War (also handing Maxim important and "sensitive" information, which reached his government during the conflict), the [[Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval|Sociedad Española de Construcciones Navales]] in Spain, a branch of [[Vickers]] were awarded, by the Spanish Government, exclusive naval construction rights for the [[Spanish Navy]].

In the aftermath of this scandal, accusations of bribery and manipulation flew in the direction of this dangerous trafficker of weapons. A Spanish Navy lawyer denounced the Spanish Government for two alleged crimes of "prevarication." The Spanish Government acted expeditiously and especially cruelly against any naval officers who went public with their discontent. The Central Chief of Staff and the Boss of the Armada Juridic Service were fired, and hundreds of officers were imprisoned and lost their jobs.

Zaharoff's power and influence in Spain lasted until his death in 1936, the year in which the [[Spanish Civil War]] began.

Also, the 1934 United States Senate [[Nye Committee]] Memorandum shows that Zaharoff was paid considerable sums for transactions made between foreign companies and the Spanish Government (for example, he got paid between a 5 and 7% commission for the price of American submarines sold to Spain, throughout all these years).

Although very little could be proved, Zaharoff was viewed as a master of bribery and corruption, but the few incidents that did become public, such as the large bribes received by Japanese Admiral Fuji (is this anachronistically referring to the 1914 [[Siemens scandal]]?), indicated that a lot more was going on behind the scenes. In 1890, the Maxim-Nordenfelt association broke up, and Zaharoff chose to go with Maxim. Using his commissions, Zaharoff bought shares in Maxim’s company until he was in a position to tell Maxim that he was no longer an employee, but an equal shareholder.

By 1897, the Maxim company had become important enough that it received a buyout offer from Vickers, one of the then giants of the armaments industry. This involved substantial settlements in both cash and shares for Maxim and Zaharoff. From then until 1911, while Maxim's business enthusiasm waned, Zaharoff's enthusiasm grew, and he expanded his portfolio of [[Vickers]] shares. After Maxim's retirement, Zaharoff was appointed to Vickers' board of directors.

The 1900s (decade) was a time for many European armies to rebuild and modernize. [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] both sought improved naval capability, and Vickers, with Zaharoff, were willing and able to service both sides. After its disastrous defeat by Japan in 1905, the Russian Navy also needed new equipment, but Russia was handcuffed by a wave of protectionism that required domestic industry for the rebuilding. Zaharoff’s response was to build a huge Russian arms production complex at [[Tsaritsyn]] as a subsidiary of Vickers.

The opening of Russian Tsarist archives after [[World War I]] led to some insights into the tactics of the arms industry. One 1907 letter, in particular, was written from the Paul von Gontard Factory (a secretly-controlled Vickers company in Germany) to a Vickers-associate in [[Paris]] recommending that [[press release]]s be sent out to the French press suggesting that the French improve their military to meet the threat posed by [[German re-armament]]. These French newspaper articles were recorded by the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]], and instigated a vote to increase military spending, all of which worked to the advantage of Zaharoff.

==World War I==
In the years immediately preceding [[World War I]], Zaharoff’s fortunes grew in other areas to support his arms business. By purchasing the ''L'Union Parisienne des Banques'' (Union Parisienne Bank), which was traditionally associated with heavy industry, he was better able to control his financing arrangements. By gaining control of ''Excelsior,'' the popular French daily newspaper, he could guarantee favourable editorials for the arms industry. To gain public recognition and acclaim, he founded a retirement home for ex-French sailors, while a Chair in Aerodynamics at the University of Paris led to further honours.

In April 1914, Australian newspapers&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympic Games - A Munificent Gift|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15503991|accessdate=20 April 2014|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 April 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; published reports from London dated 25 April that M. Zaharoff had donated ₤20,000 "in order to enable France to be worthily represented at the forthcoming Olympic Games in Berlin" in 1916. The 1916 Olympic Games were subsequently cancelled because of the war.  Zaharoff's donation represented a substantial contribution.  On May 10, the French Government announced it would donate ₤6,000 to its Olympic team, and would distribute ₤12,000 of Zaharoff's donation among its Olympic teams, with the remaining ₤8,000 to "the furtherance of the Olympic cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympic Games - Particulars of French Donation|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15517541|accessdate=20 April 2014|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 June 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 1914, coincidentally the same day that the noted [[antimilitarism|antimilitarist]] [[Jean Jaurès]] was assassinated, [[Raymond Poincaré]] signed a decree appointing Zaharoff a Commander of the [[Légion d’honneur|Legion of Honour]].

In March 1914, Vickers announced a new dawn of prosperity. During the course of the war, Vickers would produce 4 ships of the line{{cite needed|date=October 2016}}, 3 cruisers, 53 submarines, 3 auxiliary vessels, 62 light vessels, 2,328 cannon, 8,000,000 tonnes of steel ordnance, 90,000 mines, 22,000 torpedoes, 5,500 airplanes and 100,000 machine guns. By 1915, Zaharoff had close ties with both [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Aristide Briand]]. It is reported that, on the occasion of one visit with Briand, Zaharoff surreptitiously left an envelope on Aristide Briand’s desk; the envelope contained a million francs for war widows.

One of Zaharoff’s tasks during the Great War was to ensure that Greece joined the war on the Allied side, helping to reinforce the eastern front. On the surface, this seemed impossible{{clarification|reason=this seems to be overdramatic. The royal houses intermingled. Constantine  was brother-in-law by marriage to a granddaughter of Victoria |date=October 2016 }}  since [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]] was a brother-in-law of the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]]. Setting up a press agency in Greece to spread news favourable to the Allies, led, within a few months, to Constantine’s deposal in favour of Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]].

By the end of [[World War I]], ''The Times'' estimated that Zaharoff had laid out £50&amp;nbsp;million in the Allied cause.

==Post-war dealings==
In the years that followed, Zaharoff involved himself in the affairs of the lesser powers, which the [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]], involved in remaking Europe, could happily ignore. In particular, he set out to ensure that Greece and Venizelos received a proper share from the spoils from the badly weakened Turkey. In 1920, he donated half a billion [[gold franc]]s to the [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greek State]] for the [[Greece|Greek]] cause ([[Megali Idea]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hans Hallmann: ''Neugriechenlands Geschichte 1820-1948''. H. Bouvier &amp; Co., Bonn, 1949, page 132&lt;/ref&gt; Zaharoff convinced Venizelos to attack but, after some impressive initial success, the Greek Army was eventually driven back. In the elections that followed, Constantine’s loyalists managed to force Venizelos to flee, but Zaharoff stayed around to persuade the same King that he had to attack Turkey again. But with [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] now in charge of Turkey, this venture was bound to fail. Zaharoff’s war adventures were not well received by the press in Paris and London.

Zaharoff was also involved in two more significant financial ventures in October 1920, becoming involved in the incorporation of a company that was a predecessor to oil giant [[British Petroleum]]. He foresaw that there was a great future in the oil business.

His association with [[Louis II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Louis II of Monaco]] led to his purchase of the debt-ridden ''[[Société des Bains de Mer]]'', which ran Monte Carlo’s famous casino and was the principal source of revenue for the principality. He succeeded in returning the casino to profit again. At the same time, Zaharoff had prevailed upon [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] to ensure that the [[Treaty of Versailles]] included protection of [[Monaco]]’s rights as established in 1641. Louis had noted their gradual erosion over the subsequent three centuries.

==Personal life==
Zaharoff was friends with the actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and her Greek husband [[Jacques Damala]]. When Damala's mistress had an illegitimate daughter by Damala in 1889, she left the baby and a note in a basket on Sarah Bernhardt's doorstep. Baptised Teresa, the baby was given to Zaharoff, who found a family to raise her in eastern [[Thrace]] (at [[Adrianopole]]).

Zaharoff was fascinated by [[aviation]], and gave money and other support to pioneers in Great Britain, France and Russia. He encouraged Hiram Maxim's attempt to build a flying machine, and claimed he and Maxim were the first men to be lifted off the earth, when Maxim tested his first "flying machine" at [[Bexley]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: Sir Basil Zaharoff An International Financier ''The Times'' 28 November 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

He married an [[English people|English]] woman — it is believed{{by whom|date=July 2018}} as of mid-February 1911 — primarily to obtain a [[British passport]].

In September 1924, Zaharoff, 74, married María del Pilar Antonia Angela Patrocinio Fermina Simona de Muguiro y Beruete, 1st Duchess de Villafranca de los Caballeros. Previously married to a cousin of the [[King of Spain]] [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]], Lady Zaharoff was reputed{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} to be one of the richest women in Spain. About eighteen months after their marriage, she died of an infection.

After the death of Lady Zaharoff he began selling his business assets and drafted his memoirs. He apparently burnt the manuscript{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} after it was stolen by a valet and recovered by police.

Zaharoff's country house, the Château de Balincourt, at [[Arronville]] near Paris, was formerly the property of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] was filled with works of art and one of the most beautiful in France.  

Princess Marthe Bibesco claims Basil Zaharoff was an illegitimate son of her maternal grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;Princess Bibesco, "La Nymphe Europe", page 473&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brody Sweeney''' is an [[Irish people|Irish]] businessman, known for founding [[O'Briens Irish Sandwich Bars]] which went into liquidation in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=O'Brien's Sandwiches facing cuts as knives out for food industry  |author=NIAMH HORAN  |newspaper=Irish Independent |date=June 14, 2009 |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/small-business/obriens-sandwiches-facing-cuts-as-knives-out-for-food-industry-1773277.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish business was subsequently bought from the liquidator by Abrakebabra Investments Ltd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8773">Originally performed in 1894, the '''''Burlesque Opera of Tabasco''''' (also sometimes rendered ''Burlesque Opera Tabasco'') is a [[musical comedy]] composed by [[George W. Chadwick]] with a [[libretto]] by [[R. A. Barnet]].  At first titled ''Tabasco'', the opera was created without the knowledge of [[McIlhenny Company]], maker of [[Tabasco sauce|Tabasco brand pepper sauce]] since 1868.  The company, however, subsequently approved its performance.  The opera went on to tour the U.S. to critical acclaim, but disagreements between Chadwick and the musical's producer eventually derailed its success.

[[Image:Burlesque_Opera_of_Tabasco_Sheet_Music_Cover_Art,_1894.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Burlesque Opera of Tabasco'' sheet music, 1894.]]

==Origin==

A [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] volunteer militia, the [[First Corps of Cadets (Massachusetts)|First Corps of Cadets]], commissioned Chadwick and Barnet to create the opera as a fundraiser for a new armory.  The cadets themselves performed the musical for this charitable purpose.  Soon, however, showman Thomas Q. Seabrooke — impressed by the opera's popularity — purchased the rights and renamed it the ''Burlesque Opera of Tabasco'' ("[[burlesque]]" in that era meaning "comedic")&lt;ref&gt;Shane K. Bernard, ''Tabasco: An Illustrated History'' (Avery Island, La.: McIlhenny Company, 2007), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Seabrooke intended to perform the opera commercially, he required, and obtained, the permission of McIlhenny Company to use its proprietary [[trademark]].  As part of its approval, however, McIlhenny Company required Seabrooke to pass out samples of Tabasco sauce during his productions.  A giant [[papier-mâché]] Tabasco sauce bottle appeared on stage during the performance, and an image of the bottle showed up on the opera's published [[sheet music]].  So popular was Seabrooke's commercial production of the opera that “The Tabasco March,” the main theme composed by Chadwick, was issued in the form of a mechanical [[music box]] disk.

==Story==

The opera centered on a [[Middle Eastern]] [[pasha]] who craved spicy food.  Enraged by the blandness of fare provided by his royal kitchen, the pasha threatened to chop off the head of his French chef (actually a masquerading Irishman).  The chef frantically searched the city for seasonings and ran into a blind beggar who gave him a mysterious potion.  The concoction turned out to be Tabasco brand pepper sauce.  Its piquant flavor satisfied the pasha and saved the day.

==Legacy==

In 2012 [[New Orleans]] conductor [[Paul Mauffray]] became one of the first musicians to rediscover the opera's missing libretto along with other, related historical documents.  This event spurred him to reconstruct the score based on the surviving but incomplete sheet music. In 2014 Mauffray conducted part of the ''Burlesque Opera Tabasco'' in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and also conducted excerpts in such disparate locales as [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovak Republic]], [[California]], and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]]. In January 2018 Paul Mauffray conducted the entire opera in a production of New Orleans Opera Association directed by Josh Shaw, complete with sets and costumes, in performances at [[Le Petit Théâtre du Vieux Carré]] in New Orleans' [[French Quarter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguepost.com/night-day/49354-reconstructed-tabasco-opera-to-spice-up-hradec-kralove|title=Reconstructed ‘Tabasco’ opera to spice up Hradec Králové|last=Johnston|first=Raymond|date=August 19, 2015|work=[[Prague Post]]|publisher=[[PraguePost.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130142554/http://praguepost.com/night-day/49354-reconstructed-tabasco-opera-to-spice-up-hradec-kralove|archivedate=November 30, 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=December 1, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/arts/index.ssf/2014/03/taste_of_rediscoved_tabasco_sh.html|title=Taste of rediscovered 'Tabasco' shows comic opera has bounce, bite|last=Mahne|first=Theodore|date=March 18, 2014|work=[[Times-Picayune]]|publisher=[[NOLA.com]]|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/8/26/306990/120-Year-Old-Tabasco-Opera-Comes-To.aspx|title=120-Year Old Tabasco Opera Comes To Tennessee|last=|first=|date=August 26, 2015|work=[[The Chattanoogan]]|publisher=[[The Chattanoogan.com]]|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nalewicki |first=Jennifer |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/revival-124-year-old-opera-about-tabasco-sauce-180967916/ |title=Reconstructed ‘Tabasco’ opera to spice up Hradec Králové |work=[[SmithsonianMagazine.com]] |publisher=[[Smithsonian.com]] |date=August 19, 2015 |accessdate=January 26, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ledbetter |first=Steven |url=https://www.classical-scene.com/2018/02/10/chadwick-tabasco/|title=Chadwick's ''Tabasco'' Shakes Up New Orleans |work=[[The Boston Music Intelligencer]] |publisher=[[www.classical-scene.com/]] |date=February 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 9, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Astor Bristed''' (October 6, 1820 – January 14, 1874)&lt;ref name="CABObit1874"/&gt; was an American scholar and author, sometimes writing under the [[pen name]] '''Carl Benson'''.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, John Edward.

==Career==
He returned to the United States in 1847.  He amused himself contributing articles, poetical translations, critical papers on the classics, and sketches of society to various journals, and in 1849 edited ''Selections from [[Catullus]]'', for school use.  In 1850, he published "Letters to the Hon. [[Horace Mann]]", being a reply to some strictures upon the characters of Girard and Astor. In 1852 a collection of his sketches on New York Society entitled "The [[Upper Ten Thousand]]", appeared in the ''Fraser Magazine''.  At the same time he published ''Five Years in an English University'', in which he described the manners, customs, and mode of life but little understood in the United States.&lt;ref name="lehigh"/&gt;

He also published many clever poetical translations from the classics.  In his later years he resided in [[Washington, D.C.]]  He was a frequent contributor to the ''Galaxy'' under the pen-name "Carl Benson", and published ''The Interference Theory of Governments'', a book denunciatory of [[tariff]] and prohibitory liquor laws, and ''Pieces of a Broken-down Critic''.&lt;ref name="lehigh"/&gt;

==History==

===Founding===

In 1811, the idea behind the Cleveland Public Library came "out of small beginnings" when sixteen of Cleveland's sixty-four residents subscribed to its first library, established to distribute the rare printed book.  The members read books such as the history of Rome, ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets|Lives of the English Poets]]'', Goldsmith's ''Greece'', and [[Don Quixote|''Don Quixote''.]] &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Open Shelves and Open Minds: A History of the Cleveland Public Library|last=Cramer|first=C.H.|publisher=Press of Case Western Reserve University|year=1972|isbn=|location=Cleveland, OH|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, the [http://www.clevelandmetroschools.org/domain/128 Cleveland], [https://www.cps-k12.org/about-cps/board-of-education Cincinnati], and [http://www.dps.k12.oh.us/about-us/board-of-education.html Dayton] Boards of Education petitioned the [[Ohio General Assembly]] for authority to levy a tax for the maintenance of free public libraries, permitting boards of education with populations over 20,000 to levy a tax of one-tenth of a mill for each dollar evaluation of their taxable property.  Cleveland Superintendent, the [http://www.clevelandmetroschools.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&amp;DomainID=2794&amp;ModuleInstanceID=5095&amp;ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&amp;RenderLoc=0&amp;FlexDataID=3140&amp;PageID=3114 Reverend Anson Smyth], who has been doubtfully called the "father of the Cleveland Public Library," supported this law in his Superintendent position, helping in the laws' development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The new law provided for a Cleveland library that was part of the school system, controlled by the [[Cleveland Board of Education]] throughout the first decade of the library's existence, except for the years 1871-1873.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Cleveland Public Library opened on February 17, 1869 on the third floor of the Northup and Harrington Block on West Superior Avenue,  The library room was adjacent to the Cleveland Board of Education, and opened with approximately 5,800 books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Luther Melville Oviatt was the first librarian at Cleveland Public Library from 1869 to 1875.  During his first year, patrons borrowed 65,000 books.  Forwarding thinking in his views, Oviatt wanted to provide books that would interest both children and adults, the mechanic, businessman, and scholar.  He had open shelves because, "without a catalog, the only way potential borrowers could ascertain what books were available was to look at them."  Oviatt resigned in June, 1875, the victim of governing boards or their subsidiaries, who micromanaged daily operations of the library.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Librarian [[William Howard Brett]] opened the library's first stand-alone children's room on February 22, 1898.&lt;ref name="Cleveland Public Library Image Collections"&gt;Cleveland Public Library Image Collections (n.d.). Retrieved May 24, 2009 from http://cplorg.cdmhost.com/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p4014coll13&amp;CISOPTR=173&amp;COSOBOX=1&amp;REC3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Effie Louise Power]] was appointed Cleveland's first children's librarian.

In 1915, the Cleveland architectural firm of [[Walker and Weeks]] won a competition to design a new library building.  Construction of their classical Renaissance design, delayed by the First World War, began in 1923 under [[Linda Anne Eastman]]. Eastman (1867–1963) was the first woman to head a major U.S. city library system and a pioneer in the modern library system. She opened bookshelves to patrons, replacing the [[New York Public Library]] system in which a librarian fetched the books.

==Main Library==
[[File:Stokes wing.jpg|thumb|Louis Stokes Wing at the corner of Superior Avenue and East 6th Street in downtown Cleveland.]]

The Main Library consists of two buildings. The older wing, completed on May 6, 1925 and renovated between 1997 and 1999, has five stories, each as high as two stories in most buildings. The renovations included the restoration of a large mural painted by [[Ora Coltman]] in 1934 for the [[Federal Arts Project]]. The work was done by the [[Intermuseum Conservation Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland Public Library, [http://www.cpl.org/dominance.asp Dominance of the City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928004304/http://www.cpl.org/dominance.asp |date=2007-09-28 }}. Accessed 2007-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the library purchased the six-story Plain Dealer Building at 710 Superior Avenue (now the site of the Louis Stokes Wing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Library Will Seek Funds to Buy Old Plain Dealer Building|work=The Plain Dealer|date=March 21, 1957|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library won passage in November 1957 of a $3 million bond levy to pay for the purchase of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kane|first=Russell W.|title=Library Issue and School Levy Pass|work=The Plain Dealer|date=November 6, 1957|pages=1, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was purchased on December 22, 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Library to Open Annex in 1958|work=The Plain Dealer|date=December 22, 1957|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new Business and Social Sciences Annex opened on August 24, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Library-School Board Finance Feud Flares|work=The Plain Dealer|date=August 26, 1959|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annex was demolished in 1994 to make way for a second building, named after former [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Louis Stokes]], was dedicated on April 12, 1997.  Stokes commented, "This is the most beautiful that I have ever seen."  The $65 million structure of fritted glass panels and Georgia marble housed eight million items and two million titles on its grand opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mason|first1=Marilyn Gell|title=Annual report of the Cleveland Public Library for 1997|url=http://cplorg.cdmhost.com/cdm/ref/collection/p4014coll13/id/795|publisher=Cleveland Public Library|accessdate=June 20, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two buildings are connected by underground corridor below the [https://cpl.org/main-library/eastman-reading-garden/ Eastman Reading Garden], which was designed by [[landscape architecture]] firm [[OLIN]], and includes sculptures by [[Maya Lin]] and [[Tom Otterness]].

The Main Library's special collections include the Mears and [[Eugene Murdock|Murdock]] [[baseball]] collections, the Cleveland Theater collection, the [[John G. White]] [[chess libraries|chess and checkers collection]], a 130,000-volume children's collection, a 74,000-volume rare book collection, and collection of 1.3 million photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland Public Library, [https://cpl.org/thelibrary/subjectscollections/special-collections/ Special Collections]. Accessed 2017-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==(Former) Sub-Branches==
The Cleveland Public Library had Sub-Branches (Stations) named Alliance, [[Alta Public Library|Alta House]], Brooklyn, Detroit, Glenville, [[Hiram House]], Lorain, Lorain-Clark, Prospect, South Brooklyn, Superior, and Temple.

==Branches==
[[File:Carnegie West.jpg|thumb|right|Carnegie-West Branch]]During the 1890s, William Howard Brett opened four self-contained branch libraries in leased buildings.  As early as 1891, he asked Andrew Carnegie for building permanent structures, but the steel-mogul-turned-philanthropist refused the librarian's requests for 12 years.  Brett persisted and in 1903 Carnegie donated $250,000 to build seven branches, including the Woodland Branch.  Carnegie was so impressed with Brett's money management of the funds, he eventually increased the amount to $507,000, which built 15 branches-the foundation for what would become one of the largest branch systems in the United States.  Children living in the city's poorest manufacturing districts could not visit the library downtown or the new branches, so William Howard Brett and Miss Eastman put small reading collections in neighborhood homes.  By 1913, there were 57 "home libraries" in seven different working class districts, serving 11 different nationalities: Italian, Greek, Syrian, Polish, Bohemian, Hungarian, Slovak, Irish, German, Danish, and Norwegian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Lorain Ave Carnegie Library in the City of Cleveland, Ohio.jpg|thumb|right|Lorain Branch]]
[[File:South Branch Carnegie Library in Cleveland, Ohio.jpg|thumb|right|South Branch]]

Currently, the Cleveland Public Library has 27 neighborhood branches located throughout the city in addition to the Ohio Library for the Blind and Physically Disabled:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpl.org/locations |title=Locations |publisher=Cleveland Public Library |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Art and Architecture==
In 1933, William Sommer painted the Main Library's Brett Hall mural depicting Cleveland precisely a century earlier.  Sommer had access to the original 1833 prints from which the present duplications were made; or he may have seen an earlier set of duplicates made in 1868 by Sandford and Hayward. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Old print find will be shared|last=Cullinan|first=Helen|date=September 2, 1979|work=The Cleveland Plain Dealer|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent History==

In 2002, the Cleveland Public Library had annual attendance of 804,692 and an annual circulation of 1,698,928 items. In 2016, the library's collection totaled 10,557,336 items.&lt;ref name="CPL16AR"/&gt; The Cleveland Public Library is a member of [[CLEVNET]], a consortium of 44 public libraries throughout northern Ohio. In 1947, it became a depository library for the United Nations Library network, holding documents for the state of Ohio. There are only 400 UN depository libraries worldwide.

In 2002, Northern Ohio library patrons had access to download digital books and periodicals through a new e-book system headquartered at Cleveland Public Library.  The Clevnet consortium of libraries entered in a $50,000 setup-free agreement with the Cleveland-based company OverDrive to allow patrons to download text from e-books to their personal computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Cleveland PL Debuts New E-Book Loan Program|url=|journal=American Libraries|volume=34|pages=22|via=MasterFILE Premier Access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Library released a strategic plan focusing on communities of learning and preparing for its 150th anniversary in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://cpl150.org/about/strategic-plan/&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland Public Library launched Tech Central on June 14, 2012, featuring a computer lab with 90 computers, tables encouraging collaboration, a 3D printer, and a MyCloud service.  This $1 million launch was funded primarily through the Library's existing budgets, in which the MyCloud service was partially funded through corporate partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Good|first=T.|date=|title=Three Makerspace Models that Work|url=|journal=American Libraries|volume=44|pages=45–47|via=Masterfile Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cyrus McCormick Farm and Workshop''' is on the family farm of inventor [[Cyrus Hall McCormick]] known as '''Walnut Grove'''. Cyrus Hall McCormick improved and patented the mechanical [[reaper]], which eventually led to the creation of the [[combine harvester]]. The farm is near [[Steele's Tavern, Virginia|Steele's Tavern]] and [[Raphine, Virginia|Raphine]], close to the northern border of [[Rockbridge County, Virginia|Rockbridge]] and [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Virginia]], and is currently a museum run by the Virginia Agricultural Experimental Station of [[Virginia Tech]]. The museum with free admission and covers {{convert|5|acre}} of the initial {{convert|532|acre|1|sing=on}} farm.

==History==
[[File:Cyrus McCormick Farm - southeast view in afternoon.JPG|thumb|View from southeast: blacksmith shop at left, grist mill at right. The blacksmith shop was where McCormick built his reaper.]]
The farm originally covered 532 acres with buildings centered on a scant 5 acres. On the farm eight out of the nine original buildings are still standing, many of which have been renovated since the farm was created in 1822 by [[Robert McCormick (Virginia)|Robert McCormick]] (1780–1846). The eight existing buildings include a grist mill, [[blacksmith]] shop, slave quarters, carriage house, manor house, smoke house, schoolroom, and housekeeper's quarters. In the original construction of the farm there was also an ice house which was demolished in the 1960s. Each of these different buildings played a specific role in the daily routine of the Cyrus McCormick farm. The grist mill, built prior to 1800, was used to grind wheat for flour. The blacksmith shop was used to build and repair all the farm implements needed by the McCormick family and was where Cyrus McCormick engineered his reaper. Slave quarters served as the home for the nine slaves that the McCormick family owned. Furthermore, the carriage house was used as a garage for the carriages and other wheeled vehicles. The manor house is centrally located on the farm and was constructed of brick in 1822, making it the first building on the McCormick farm. Behind the brick manor house was the smoke house where meat was dried and smoked to preserve it through the winter. Refrigeration was not introduced until the late 19th century. The McCormick family also maintained a school on their property for neighboring children.

The McCormick Farm at Walnut Grove is known as the birthplace of the mechanical [[reaper]], the predecessor to the [[combine harvester]]. Cyrus McCormick reportedly designed, built, and tested his reaper all within six weeks at Walnut Grove, although the design may have been merely an improvement upon the similar device developed by his father and his brother Leander over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The McCormick Family and their Mechanical Reaper |url= http://www.astro.virginia.edu/research/observatories/26inch/history/reaper.php |publisher= Leander McCormick Observatory Museum |accessdate= December 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after constructing his first reaper he went on to harvest his first crop with it later that year. After building his first reaper, Cyrus constantly went back to the drawing board to revise and improve his basic design, coming out with new models almost every decade.

After his father's death, Cyrus McCormick moved his base of operations from Rockbridge County, Virginia to [[Chicago, Illinois]] in 1847 because of the fertile prairie soil in the [[midwestern United States]]. In 1859, Cyrus was joined by his brothers [[Leander James McCormick]] and [[William Sanderson McCormick]] to form the company Cyrus H. McCormick and Brothers. By the end of the 19th century, McCormick's company had built a primitive combine, which could harvest grain even faster and cheaper than older reapers.  Prior to inventing the reaper, farmers could only harvest {{convert|0.5|acre|adj=on}} a day; after the reaper was invented, farmers could harvest {{convert|12|acre}} a day using less manual labor. The mechanical reaper did not require a family to toil all day to harvest crops. Instead, a single farmer merely operated the machine and the reaper would do the rest of the work. His work in mechanical reapers and harvesting techniques allowed farmers to cultivate plots of land bigger than ever thought possible.
In 1902, the company was merged with competitor [[Deering Harvester Company]] and (smaller ones) to form [[International Harvester]].

==Preservation==
The farm remained in the McCormick family up to 1954, before being donated to [[Virginia Polytechnical Institute]] as an agricultural center and Farm Memorial.  Currently, the schoolroom has vintage textbooks, toys, and other school supplies dating from the 1830s. 
It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Walnut Grove / McCormick (Cyrus) Farm and Workshop (Walnut Grove)|url={{NHLS url|id=66000846}} |format=pdf|date=February 1, 1975 |author=Stephen Lissandrello |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NHLS url|id=66000846|title=''Accompanying  44 photos, exterior and interior of mill, blacksmith shop, slave quarters, house, undated''|photos=y}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(32&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: McCormick (Cyrus) Farm and Workshop / Walnut Grove|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Rockbridge/081-0073_McCormick,_Cyrus,_Farm_and_Workshop_1966_Final_Nomination.pdf |format=pdf|date=June 30, 1972 |author=Frank S. Melvin |publisher=National Park Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The farm is less than {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} from the interchange of Raphine Road and [[Interstate 81 in Virginia|Interstate 81]], halfway between [[Lexington, Virginia]] and [[Staunton, Virginia]].

'''Data monetization''', a form of [[monetization]], may refer to the act of generating measurable economic benefits from available data sources (analytics). Less commonly, it may also refer to the act of monetizing data services&lt;ref&gt;https://inform.tmforum.org/digital-transformation-and-maturity/2018/02/four-models-data-monetization/&lt;/ref&gt;. In the case of analytics, typically, these benefits accrue as revenue or expense savings, but may also include market share or corporate market value gains. Data monetization leverages data generated through business operations, available exogenous data or content, as well as data associated with individual actors such as that collected via electronic devices and sensors participating in the [[internet of things]]. For example, the ubiquity of the [[internet of things]] is generating [[location data]] and other data from sensors and [[mobile devices]] at an ever-increasing rate. When this data is collated against traditional databases, the value and utility of both sources of data increases, leading to tremendous potential to mine data for social good, research and discovery, and achievement of business objectives.  Closely associated with data monetization are the emerging [[data as a service]] models for transactions involving data by the data item.

There are three [[ethical]] and regulatory vectors involved in data monetization due to the sometimes conflicting interests of actors involved in the [[digital supply chain]].  The individual data creator who generates files and records through his own efforts or owns a device such as a sensor or a mobile phone that generates data has a claim to ownership of data.  The business entity that generates data in the course of its operations, such as its transactions with financial institutions or [[risk factors]] discovered through feedback from customers also has a claim on data captured through their systems and platforms. However, the person that contributed the data may also have a legitimate claim on the data.  Internet platforms and service providers, such as [[Google]] or [[Facebook]] that require a user to forgo some ownership interest in their data in exchange for use of the platform also have a legitimate claim on the data.  Thus the practice of data monetization, although common since 2000, is now getting increasing attention from regulators.  The [[European Union]] and the [[United States Congress]] have begun to address these issues.  For instance, in the financial services industry, regulations involving data are included in the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] and [[Dodd-Frank]].  Some individual creators of data are shifting to using [[personal data vaults]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2014/0032267.html|title=User controlled system and method for collecting, pricing, and trading data|website=Freepatentsonline.com|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implementing [[vendor relationship management]] concepts as a reflection of an increasing resistance to their data being federated or aggregated and resold without compensation.  Groups such as the Personal Data Ecosystem Consortium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://personaldataecosystem.org]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514024308/http://personaldataecosystem.org/ |date=2014-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patient privacy]] [[privacy rights|rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patientprivacyrights.org/|title=Patient Privacy Rights – Privacy is your right. We help make it happen.|website=Patientprivacyrights.org|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others are also challenging corporate cooptation of data without compensation.

[[Financial services]] companies are a relatively good example of an industry focused on generating revenue by leveraging data.  [[Credit card]] issuers and [[retail banks]] use customer transaction data to improve targeting of [[cross-sell]] offers.  Partners are increasingly promoting merchant based [[reward programs]] which leverage a bank’s data and provide discounts to customers at the same time.

==Steps==
# Identification of available data sources – this includes data currently available for monetization as well as other external data sources that may enhance the value of what’s currently available.
# Connect, aggregate, attribute, validate, authenticate, and exchange data - this allows data to be converted directly into actionable or revenue generating insight or services.
# Set terms and prices and facilitate data trading - methods for data vetting, storage, and access. For example, many global corporations have locked and siloed data storage infrastructures, which stymies efficient access to data and cooperative and real-time exchange. 
# Perform [[Research]] and [[analytics]] – draw predictive insights from existing data as a basis for using data for to reduce [[risk]], enhance product development or performance, or improve [[customer experience]] or business outcomes.
# Action and leveraging – the last phase of monetizing data includes determining alternative or improved datacentric products, ideas, or services.  Examples may include real-time actionable triggered notifications or enhanced channels such as web or mobile response mechanisms.

==Pricing variables and factors==
*  A [[fee]] for 
**use of a platform to connect buyers and sellers
** use of a platform to configure, organize, and otherwise process data included in a data trade 
** connecting or including a device or sensor into a data supply chain
** connecting and credentialing a creator of a data source and a data buyer – often through a [[federated identity]]
** connecting a data source to other data sources to be included in a data supply chain
** use of an internet service or other transmission services for uploading and downloading data – sometimes, for an individual, through a [[personal cloud]]
** use of encrypted keys to achieve secure data transfer
** use of a search algorithm specifically designed to tag data sources that contain data points of value to the data buyer
** linking a data creator or generator to a data collection protocol or form
** server actions – such as a notification – triggered by an update to a data item or data source included in a data supply chain
*  A price or exchange or other [[trade value]] 
**assigned by a data creator or generator to a data item or a data source 
**offered by a data buyer to a data creator 
**assigned by a data buyer for a data item or a data source formatted according to criteria set by a data buyer
*  An incremental fee assigned by a data buyer for a data item or a data set scaled to the reputation of the data creator

==Benefits==
*  Improved decision-making that leads to [[real time (media)|real time]] [[crowd sourced]] research, improved profits, decreased costs, reduced risk and improved compliance
*  More impactful decisions (e.g., make real-time decisions)
*  More timely (lower latency) decisions (e.g., a vendor making purchase recommendations while the customer is still on the phone or in the store, a customer connecting with multiple vendors to discover the best price, triggered notifications when thresholds are reached for data values)
*  More granular decisions (e.g., localized pricing decisions at an individual or device or sensor level versus larger aggregates).
*Targeted Marketing (e.g., Vendors with access to big data can make targeted advertisements to specific customers within a set data pool decreasing costs for the advertiser and reaching most interested customers)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3795764|title=Market Trends: Ways CSPs Can Exploit Location Data|last=|first=|date=|website=Gartner.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frameworks==
There are a wide variety of industries, firms and business models related to data monetization.  The following frameworks have been offered to help understand the types of business models that are used:

Roger Ehrenberg of IA Ventures, a [[venture capital]] firm that invests in this sector, has defined three basic types of data product firms:
{{cquote|'''Contributory databases'''. The magic of these businesses is that a customer provides their own data in exchange for receiving a more robust set of aggregated data back that provides insight into the broader marketplace, or provides a vehicle for expressing a view. Give a little, get a lot back in return –  a pretty compelling value proposition, and one that frequently results in a payment from the data contributor in exchange for receiving enriched, aggregated data. Once these contributory databases are developed and customers become reliant on their insights, they become extremely valuable and persistent data assets.

'''Data processing platforms'''. These businesses create barriers through a combination of complex data architectures, proprietary algorithms, and rich analytics to help customers consume data in whatever form they please. Often these businesses have special relationships with key data providers, that when combined with other data and processed as a whole create valuable differentiation and competitive barriers. Bloomberg is an example of a powerful data processing platform. They pull in data from a wide array of sources (including their own homegrown data), integrate it into a unified stream, make it consumable via a dashboard or through an API, and offer a robust analytics suite for a staggering number of use cases. Needless to say, their scale and profitability is the envy of the industry.

'''Data creation platforms'''. These businesses solve vexing problems for large numbers of users, and by their nature capture a broad swath of data from their customers. As these data sets grow, they become increasingly valuable in enabling companies to better tailor their products and features and to target customers with highly contextual and relevant offers. Customers don’t sign up to directly benefit from the data asset; the product is so valuable that they simply want the features offered out-of-the-box. As the product gets better over time, it just cements the lock-in of what is already a successful platform. Mint was an example of this kind of business. People saw value in the core product. But the product continued to get better as more customer data was collected and analyzed. There weren’t network effects, per se, but the sheer scale of the data asset that was created was an essential element of improving the product over time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehrenberg |first=Roger |title=Creating competitive advantage through data |url=http://www.iaventures.com/creating-competitive-advantage-through-data |publisher=IA Ventures' blog |accessdate=23 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203023719/http://www.iaventures.com/creating-competitive-advantage-through-data |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Selvanathan and Zuk&lt;ref&gt;Big Data Realized: Developing New Data-Driven Products and Services to Drive Growth Perspective&lt;/ref&gt; offer a framework that includes "monetization methods that are outside the bounds of the traditional value capture systems employed by an enterprise... tuned to match the context and consumption models for the target customer."  They offer examples of "four distinct approaches: platforms, applications, data-as-a-service, and professional services."

==Examples==
*  Packaging of data (with analytics) to be resold to customers for things such as wallet share, [[market share]] and [[benchmarking]]
*  Integration of data (with analytics) into new products as a value-added differentiator such as [[On-Star]] for [[General Motors]] cars
* [[GPS]] enabled [[smartphones]]
* [[Geolocation]]-based offers and location discounts, such as those offered by [[Facebook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jan/31/facebook-places-deals-uk-europe|title=Facebook Places Deals to target local business ads in UK and Europe|first=Jemima|last=Kiss|date=31 January 2011|accessdate=24 August 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Groupon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/05/10/groupon-now-launches/|title=Say Hello to Groupon Now &amp; Right Here, Right Now Deals|first=Ben|last=Parr|website=Mashable.com|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are other prime examples of data monetization leveraging new emerging channels
* CRM based ad targeting and media attribution, such as those offered by Circulate
*Big Data based [[Marketing campaign|marketing campaigns]] like those offered by Instarea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3795764|title=Market Trends: Ways CSPs Can Exploit Location Data|website=www.gartner.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property landscape==
Some of the patents issued since 2010 by the [[USPTO]] for monetizing data generated by individuals include; 8,271,346, 8,612,307, 8,560,464, 8,510,176, and 7,860,760.  These are usually in class 705 related to electronic commerce, data processing, and cost and price determination. Some of these patents use the term, the data supply chain to reflect emerging technology to federate and aggregate data in real time from many individuals and devices linked together through the [[internet of things]].  Another emerging term is [[information banking]].

An unexplored but potentially disruptive arena for data monetization is the use of [[Bitcoin]] [[micropayments]] for data transactions.  Because Bitcoins are emerging as competitors with payment services like Visa or PayPal that can readily enable and reduce or eliminate transaction costs, transactions for as little as a single data item can be facilitated. Consumers, as well as enterprises who desire to monetize their participation in a data supply chain, may soon be able to access social network enabled Bitcoin exchanges and platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Lomas, Natasha, Techcrunch, August 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clickbait]] and data hijacking may wither as micropayments for data are ubiquitous and enabled. Potentially, even the current need to build out data broker managed data trading exchanges may be bypassed.  Stanley Smith,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140831030916/http://www.linkedin.com/pub/stan-smith/9/3ab/b37/] &lt;/ref&gt; who introduced the notion of the data supply chain, has said that simple micropayments for data monetization are the key to evolution of ubiquitous implementation of user configurable data supply schemata, enabling data monetization on a universal scale for all data creators, including the burgeoning internet of things.

In his last will Jerzmanowski presented all his wealth to [[Academy of Learning]] in Kraków. He ordered the Academy to establish the foundation and the award named after him and his wife. People distinguished with Jerzmanowscy Award had to be Polish Roman Catholics who had served Poland with their artistic, scientific or social activities. Payments are made from Jerzmanowski's funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.smj.jaroslaw.pl/biblioteczkasmj/archiwalia/187-erazm-jerzmanowski-fundator-polskiej-nagrody-nobla|title=Erazm Jerzmanowski – fundator polskiej Nagrody Nobla|publisher=Stowarzyszenie Miłośników Jarosławia|accessdate=6 May 2014|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fair Tax Town (FTT)''' movement (also called the '''Powys tax rebellion'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abergavenny-chronicle-today.co.uk/article.cfm?id=100719&amp;headline=Crickhowell%20businesses%20lead%20tax%20rebellion&amp;sectionIs=news&amp;searchyear=2015 Powys Tax Rebellion as alternative name given to Fair Tax Town movement]&lt;/ref&gt; ) is a movement established by several shop owners in [[Crickhowell]], [[Powys]], [[Wales]]. 

==Documentary==
During the establishment of the movement, a documentary was made by the BBC along with it. This documentary, narrated by [[Heydon Prowse]] is called ''"The Town that went Offshore"'' or ''"The Town That Took on the Taxman"'' and was first shown in January 2016. 

The movie follows the business owners as they decide to establish an untaxed [[Isle of Man|Manx]] company which designs and owns a brand (''Crickhowell Fair Tax''), use the brand in their advertising and pay royalties for using this brand, as big companies do with their own brands. Their Manx company sets up a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] subsidiary which receives the royalties and sends them to the Isle of Man, since Britain would tax royalties sent directly to a tax haven, but charges no tax on royalty payments to the Netherlands, and the Netherlands charges no tax on royalties sent to tax havens. Thus their money accumulates tax-free in the Isle of Man, and the movie suggests ways to use it for expenses in Wales, such as borrowing it. The movie also discusses customer relationship managers which [[HM Revenue and Customs|tax authorities]] assign to big businesses to ensure their tax arrangements are valid.&lt;ref name="dmail"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3313583/The-Powys-revolution-entire-Welsh-town-going-offshore-avoid-tax-local-businesses-just-like-Google-Starbucks.html |title=Welsh town is going 'offshore' to avoid tax on just like Google |last=Robinson |first=Martin |date=2015-11-11 |website=Mail Online |access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reg"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/13/welsh_town_moves_offshore_bbc/ |title=BBC encourages rebellious Welsh town to move offshore |last=Fay |first=Joe |date=2015-11-13 |website=The Register |language=en |access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imdbtax"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6668494/ |title=The Town That Took on the Taxman |date=2016-01-20 |website=IMDB |access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spreading the movement==
The movement's aim is to persuade governments to change their tax regulation so that small businesses get the same level of tax as [[multinational corporation|multinationals]] and other large businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fairtaxtown.com/home/the-brand-handbook/ FTT website FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; To help achieve this, FTT has started to share their expertise on how to make businesses engage in [[tax avoidance]]. Since then, many other towns have adopted the scheme.

==Passing the baton==
After spending two years developing and publicizing the project, the Crickhowell businesses decided not to proceed. Prowse, the documentarian, said he hoped another group of people would take the idea another step, "If you want to put your money through a scheme like that, you’ve got to expect that the taxman’s going to contact you and you’re going to have to defend yourself, possibly in court."&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://inews.co.uk/news/business/town-took-taxman-gave-battle-whos-going-take-mantle/ |title=The town that took on the taxman gave up their battle - so who's going to take up the mantle? - The i newspaper online iNews |last=Grant |first=Katie |date=2017-10-05 |website=iNews |language=en-GB |access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial challenges by Circle Food Group were the result of “poor leadership”, and Hlumelo and Clive Rugara failed to manage their businesses correctly and lacked basic ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/empty-promises-employees-accuse-hlumelo-biko-of-owing-them-money-20180516|title=‘Empty promises’: Employees accuse Hlumelo Biko of owing them money|work=CityPress|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8366">'''Henry John Heinz II''' (July 10, 1908 – February 23, 1987) was an [[Americans|American]] business executive and [[CEO]] of the [[H. J. Heinz Company]] based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA. His grandfather [[Henry J. Heinz]] founded the company in the nineteenth century, and he worked in a variety of positions within the company before becoming CEO.

Heinz II was the father of [[John Heinz]], elected as a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, who died in a plane crash in 1991.

==Early life, education, early career==
Heinz was born in Pittsburgh to Howard Covode Heinz and Elizabeth Granger (Rust) Heinz. His grandfather [[Henry J. Heinz]] had founded the [[H. J. Heinz Company]], and his father worked for the company for decades, becoming president after the founder died.

Heinz II was educated at [[Choate Rosemary Hall|Choate]], and graduated from [[Yale University]], where he was a member of the [[Skull and Bones]] secret society. He also earned a degree from [[Oxford University]]. During the summers, he worked for his father's Heinz Company in the pickling and salting stations, as bookkeeper and as handyman. He later joined the sales force in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Heinz: A Western Pennsylvania Legacy|url=http://www.johnheinzlegacy.org/index.html|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinz had some early political experience. He served as the [[Pittsburgh Fire Bureau]] Chief from 1935 until 1936, and then as [[Allegheny County Sheriff]] for Pittsburgh from 1938 until 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p3xIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=imoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=pittsburgh%20fire%20chief&amp;pg=1178%2C2257331 |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=Aug 27, 1949 |accessdate=2012-08-17 |page=8 |title=Richard Smith, Ex-Fire Chief, Dies in South}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Heinz married Joan Diehl, a pioneer aviator, in 1935. They were the parents of one son, [[H.J. Heinz III]]. They established their home, Rosemont Farm, in the [[Fox Chapel]] suburb of Pittsburgh. The couple divorced in 1942.

In 1953, Heinz married [[Drue Heinz|Drue Maher]], with whom he shared a love of philanthropy, skiing, art collecting and world travel.

==Leadership of H.J. Heinz Company==
Heinz started work early in his grandfather's company, learning every aspect of the business. In 1941, he advanced to become president of the Heinz Company upon his father's death of a stroke.

He led the company through the challenges of World War II. For a time the Heinz plant in Pittsburgh was converted to producing gliders for the War Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection of H.J. Heinz Co.|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=hswpead;cc=hswpead;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-QQS-MSS57|publisher=Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made five trips to England during the war: once to see about the bombed Heinz plant in Harlesden, and several times by request of the British government to assist with relieving its food shortages. He also aided the Netherlands with their food challenges.

As chairman of the United War Fund, Heinz routinely gave speeches in the Pittsburgh region and elsewhere about food conservation, rationing, and allocations. After the war, he served as chairman of the Community Chest in Pittsburgh, which became the [[United Way of America|United Way]], a national organization with chapters across the country.

As president of the Heinz Company, Jack launched subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Portugal, Venezuela, Japan, and Italy, establishing a large international network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry J. Heinz; Ex-Chairman of Food Empire|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-02-28/news/mn-6327_1_henry-john-heinz-ii|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquisitions of [[Star-Kist Foods Inc.]] and [[Ore-Ida|Ore-Ida Foods Inc.]] are considered the hallmarks of his tenure. He also presided over the opening of a baby food plant on mainland China.

===Resignation===
In 1966, Heinz resigned as president and CEO. For the first time in company history, a non-family member, [[R. Burt Goodkin]], was chosen as CEO to manage day-to-day operations. Heinz served as chairman of the board from 1966 until his death.

==Philanthropy==
After the war, Heinz teamed up with [[Richard King Mellon]] and Pittsburgh mayor [[David L. Lawrence|David Lawrence]] for [[Renaissance I]], a plan to improve and modernize Pittsburgh. Redevelopment included smoke-control ordinances to clear the air of smoke and soot from the steel mills. This also helped improve water quality in the city's rivers, for which additional environmental laws were passed.

Heinz was the driving force for the creation of downtown Pittsburgh's [[Cultural District, Pittsburgh|Cultural District]], a major legacy of his work as a philanthropist and community leader.  He was the first chairman of the [[Heinz Endowments]], serving from 1941 until his death in 1987. One of his early projects was the conversion and restoration of Lowe's Penn Theater to the current [[Heinz Hall]], home of the [[Pittsburgh Symphony]].

Heinz was one of the original investors in the city's effort to win an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] franchise, becoming part owner of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] from 1967 until the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pittsburghhockey.net/old-site/PensPages/66-69ERA/67Expansion.html |title=1967-68 NHL Expansion |publisher=Pittsburghhockey.net |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510131830/http://pittsburghhockey.net/old-site/PensPages/66-69ERA/67Expansion.html |archivedate=2012-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
A lifelong Republican, Heinz chaired the U.S. arm of the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] from 1948-1951. He was tapped by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to head a special aid mission to assess the effectiveness of an emergency economic aid program to Pakistan. He also chaired the U.S. delegation to a [[Economic Commission for Europe]] in 1958 and 1959. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the [[Bilderberg Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/former-steering-committee-members.html |title=Former Steering Committee Members |work=bilderbergmeetings.org |publisher=[[Bilderberg Group]] |accessdate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095633/http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/former-steering-committee-members.html |archivedate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
In 1979, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] made Heinz an Honorary Commander of the Most Excellent [[Order of the British Empire]], citing him "for significant contribution in the furtherance of British-American relationships, especially in the cultural, educational and economic fields."

He received decorations from Italy, France, and Greece.

==Death==
On 23 February 1987, Henry John Heinz II died of cancer at the family's winter home in [[Hobe Sound, Florida]], at the age of 78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HENRY JOHN HEINZ 2D DIES AT 78; LED INTERNATIONAL FOOD COMPANY|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/24/obituaries/henry-john-heinz-2d-dies-at-78-led-international-food-company.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeffrey Thomas DeGraff''' (born 1958) is an American professor, professional speaker, author, and consultant. He is known for his contribution and development work on the ''Competing Values Framework'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://competingvalues.com/competingvalues.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Competing-Values-Leadership-Media-Kit.pdf |title=Leadership : Creating Values in Organizations : Executive Summary |publisher=Competingvalues.com |accessdate=2013-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029221237/http://competingvalues.com/competingvalues.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Competing-Values-Leadership-Media-Kit.pdf# |archive-date=2013-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a model about understanding how to appreciate conflicting values and integrate them successfully so that an organization is open to collaboration and growth. He is a consultant to executive teams at [[Fortune 500]] companies, assessing the company’s capabilities around innovation and their prospects of growing the business. DeGraff is also a professor at the Ross School of Business at the [[University of Michigan]], where he teaches undergraduate, MBA, and executive MBA classes on innovation, as well as numerous executive education classes on competency and culture development, practices and methods, and leadership.

==Early life==
DeGraff was born in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], United States, the second of five children. He holds a B. S. in Communication Arts and Sciences and a teaching certificate from Western Michigan University (1980), an M.A. in Communication and Information Studies from the [[University of Michigan]] (1982, Lloyd Hall Fellowship), and a Ph.D. in Educational Technology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (1985).

==Career==
Rejoining the faculty at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, DeGraff was the Vice President of Communications and New Ventures for [[Domino's Pizza]] (1985-1990). The youngest member of the executive team at twenty-six years old, DeGraff’s work focused on innovation and strategies to help Domino’s Pizza's considerable and notable growth during the 1980s. It was at Domino’s Pizza that DeGraff received the unofficial title of “Dean of Innovation.”

After five years at Domino’s Pizza, Professor Robert Quinn recruited DeGraff to join the faculty at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan to develop and teach a series of graduate courses on leading creativity and innovation. Today he is a top rated Professor of Management and Organizations for the school, having received the University of Michigan’s 2011 Voices of the Staff award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hr.umich.edu/voices/awards/ |title=University of Michigan Voices of the Staff |publisher=Hr.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1990, DeGraff began working with Robert Quinn, one of the creators of the Competing Values Framework, becoming a managing partner of the firm Competing Values, LLC. DeGraff collaborated with Quinn and Kim Cameron and applied the Competing Values Framework model to business innovation and value creation as a methodology that integrates strategy, finance, innovation development, and human resource management disciplines. Using this model, DeGraff began consulting to Fortune 500 companies, helping them build custom innovation processes and working with them through their specific business challenges.

In 2009, DeGraff founded the ''Innovatrium Institute for Innovation'' with labs in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta, Georgia. Innovatrium is an innovation partnership between Haworth Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web-archive-sources.org/repository/june14/SD-Innovatrium_Brochure.pdf] {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; top universities and top firms to develop new practices for leading innovation, to connect public and private organizations, and to bring experts, practitioners, university professors, and students together to solve real world problems.

In June 2011, DeGraff hosted a national PBS television show about leading innovation, called ''Innovation You''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXtDR3qTWM4 |title=Jeff DeGraff talks about INNOVATION YOU |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20110612/COL07/106120426/Susan-Tompor-Lessons-from-an-innovation-guru |title=Susan Tompor: Lessons from an innovation guru &amp;#124; Susan Tompor &amp;#124; Detroit Free Press |publisher=freep.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeGraff is the author of the book Innovation You: Four Steps to Becoming New and Improved (Ballantine Books, July 2011), and the co-author of the books Competing Values Leadership: Creating Value in Organizations (Edward Elgar Publishing, September 2007), Leading Innovation: How to Jumpstart Your Company’s Growth Engine (McGraw Hill, August 2006), and Creativity at Work: Developing the Right Practices to Make Innovation Happen (Jossey-Bass, August 2002). Additionally, DeGraff writes a syndicated blog for Psychology Today and the Huffington Post.

'''Virginia Joan Kennedy''' (née '''Bennett''', born September 2, 1936) is an American [[socialite]], musician, author, and former model, and was the first wife of [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Ted Kennedy]].

==Early life==
Virginia Joan Bennett was born at [[Mother Cabrini]] Hospital in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="women of camelot"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taraborrelli|first=J. Randy|title=Jackie, Ethel, Joan: Women of Camelot|date=2012-04-02|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=044656463X|pages=81–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in a [[Roman Catholic]] family,&lt;ref name="women of camelot"/&gt; in suburban [[Bronxville, New York]]. Her parents were Harry Wiggin Bennett Jr. (1907–1981) and Virginia Joan Stead (1911–1976).&lt;ref name="women of camelot"/&gt; Her father was a graduate of [[Cornell University]] and later worked as an advertising executive. Bennett grew up with one younger sister, Candace "Candy," (born 1938). She attended [[Manhattanville College]] (then a Sacred Heart college), in [[Purchase, New York]].&lt;ref name="women of camelot"/&gt; Manhattanville was also the ''alma mater'' of her future mother-in-law, [[Rose Kennedy]], as well as her future sisters-in-law [[Jean Kennedy Smith]] and [[Ethel Kennedy|Ethel Skakel Kennedy]]. In 1982, Bennett received an MA in Education from Lesley College, now known as [[Lesley University]]. As a teenager, she worked as a model in television advertising.&lt;ref name=2005Deseret&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20050402/ai_n13509653 |title=Joan Kennedy's troubles linked to alcohol struggle |last=Lindsay |first=Jay |date=April 2, 2005 |publisher=''[[Associated Press|The Associated Press]]'' ''via'' ''[[Deseret News]]'' |accessdate=2008-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523230950/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20050402/ai_n13509653/ |archivedate=May 23, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage, family and divorce==
In October 1957, at the dedication of a gymnasium at Manhattanville College in memory of another Kennedy sister, [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen]] – who had died in a plane crash in [[France]] in 1948 – Jean Kennedy Smith introduced Joan to her younger brother Edward - Ted, then a student at the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]].&lt;ref name=bostonmag&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/the_fall_of_joan/ |title=The Fall of Joan |last=McPhee |first=Michelle |author2=Wedge, Dave |date=August 2005 |publisher=''[[Boston magazine|Boston]]'' |accessdate=2008-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521040439/http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/the_fall_of_joan/ |archivedate=May 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the couple became engaged, she grew nervous about marrying someone she did not know that well, but Joe Kennedy insisted that the wedding should proceed,&lt;ref name="clymer-23"&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; and they were married on November 29, 1958, in [[Bronxville, New York]].&lt;ref name="women of camelot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kennedys/sfeature/sf_tree_text.html|title=American Experience: The Kennedys|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small family wedding was held just a few weeks after Ted's older brother [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[John F. Kennedy]] won his landslide re-election for his  [[United States Senate]] seat representing [[Massachusetts]] in 1958. Joan had three children with Ted Kennedy: [[Kara Kennedy]] (1960–2011), [[Edward M. Kennedy Jr.|Edward M. Kennedy Jr. (Ted Jr.)]] (b. 1961), and [[Patrick J. Kennedy]] (b. 1967).

Two of their children were cancer victims. Ted Jr. developed [[bone cancer]] at age 12, which resulted in the removal of a portion of his right leg in 1973, and Kara was treated for lung cancer in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2008/05/25/kennedy_his_children_and_cancer/|title=Kennedy, his children, and cancer|last=Jacobs|first=Sally|date=May 25, 2008|publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daughter Kara Kennedy died of a heart attack at age 51 on September 16, 2011.

Ted suffered a severe back injury in a 1964 airplane crash while campaigning for his first full Senate term. She assumed the full campaign-appearance schedule for his successful [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1964|re-election in 1964]]. He had earlier won a [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962|special election in November 1962]] to serve out the final two years of his brother John's Senate six year term; John had resigned from the U.S. Senate upon his [[United States presidential election, 1960|November 1960 election]] as the 35th U.S. President.

In July 1969, Ted Kennedy was involved in a [[Chappaquiddick incident|car accident at a bridge off Chappaquiddick Island]] in Massachusetts that resulted in the death of his passenger, [[Mary Jo Kopechne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bly|first=Nellie|title=The Kennedy Men: Three Generations of Sex, Scandal and Secrets|publisher=[[Kensington Books]], New York|year=1996|isbn=1-57566-106-3|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although pregnant and confined to bed in the wake of two previous [[miscarriage]]s, Joan attended Kopechne's funeral. Three days later, she stood beside her husband in a local court when he pleaded guilty to [[hit and run|leaving the scene of an accident]]. She suffered a third miscarriage shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taraborrelli|first=J.

The couple separated in 1978 after twenty years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912497,00.html|author=Staff writer|title=The Vulnerable Soul of Joansie|date=November 5, 1979|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently told ''[[McCall's]]'' magazine about her alcoholism and her work to stay sober.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Richard E. |author2=Hoffer, Marilyn |author3=Hoffer, William |title=The Senator: My Ten Years with Ted Kennedy|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]. New York|year=1992|pages=147–148|isbn=978-0-312-09134-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remained together officially married during his failed [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1980|1980 U.S. presidential campaign]], later announcing plans to divorce in 1981; the divorce was finalized in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maier|first=Thomas |title=The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings|publisher=[[Basic Books]], New York|year=2003|isbn=0-465-04317-8|page=555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1992, she published the book ''The Joy of Classical Music:  A Guide for You and Your Family''. Kennedy has worked with children's charities, remains an accomplished pianist and has taught classical music to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=262948|author=Staff writer|title=Joan Bennett Kennedy Biography (1936– )|date=n.d.|publisher=[[The Biography Channel]]|accessdate=2009-08-28}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy's later years have been shaped by chronic alcoholism, which had developed during her marriage. The alcohol problem escalated with sporadic, uneven sobriety, repeated [[Driving under the influence|drunk-driving]] arrests,&lt;ref name=2005Deseret/&gt; court-ordered [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]],&lt;ref name=2005Deseret /&gt; and a return to drinking. This ultimately led to [[kidney]] damage, with the possibility of [[dialysis]]&lt;ref name="bostonmag"/&gt; and protracted complications. In July 2004, her son, Ted Jr., had been appointed her legal guardian; in 2005, her children were granted temporary guardianship. That year, she was hospitalized with a [[concussion]] and a broken shoulder after being found lying in a Boston street near her home.&lt;ref name=2005Deseret /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/30/politics/main684126.shtml |author=Hancock, David| title=Joan Kennedy Unconscious in Street – Senator's Ex-Wife Recovering from Concussion, Broken Shoulder | date=March 30, 2005 | publisher=''[[Associated Press|The Associated Press]]'' ''via'' ''[[CBS News]]'' | accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/02/25/kennedys_children_become_her_guardians/|title=Kennedy's Children Become Her Guardians|last=Johnson|first=Glenn|date=February 25, 2005|publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, she requested that her second cousin, [[financial planner]] Webster E.

'''Joseph Patrick Kennedy Jr.''' (July 25, 1915 – August 12, 1944) was a [[United States Navy]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]]. He was killed in action during World War II while serving as a land-based patrol bomber pilot, and was posthumously awarded the [[Navy Cross]]. He was the eldest of nine children born to [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]] (1888–1969) and [[Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy]] (1890–1995). He was the only Kennedy son who never sought political office, though he had planned to.

Joe Sr. had aspirations for Joe Jr. to become [[President of the United States|president]].{{r|Olsen}}{{Page needed|date=August 2015}}  However, Joe Jr. was killed while participating in a [[Operation Aphrodite|top-secret mission]] in 1944, and the high expectations of the father then fell upon Joe Jr.'s younger brother [[John F. Kennedy|John]], who was later elected president.

== Early life and education ==
Kennedy was born in Hull, Massachusetts. He first attended the [[Dexter School]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], with his brother, John. In 1933, he graduated from the [[Choate School]] in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]]. He then entered [[Harvard College]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], graduating in 1938. Kennedy participated in [[American football|football]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], and [[sport rowing|crew]], and he served on the student council. Kennedy then spent a year studying under the tutelage of [[Harold Laski]] at the [[London School of Economics]] before enrolling in [[Harvard Law School]].

===Political ambitions and views===
From a very young age, Kennedy was groomed by his father and predicted to be the first Roman Catholic president of the United States. When he was born, his grandfather [[John F. Fitzgerald]], then Mayor of Boston, told the news, "This child is the future President of the nation." He often boasted that he would be president even without help from his father. He was a delegate to the [[1940 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in 1940. Kennedy planned to run for the U.S. House from [[Massachusetts's 11th congressional district]] in 1946.

Kennedy expressed approval of [[Adolf Hitler]] before his conquest of Europe began. His father sent him to visit Nazi Germany in 1934. He wrote to his father, praising Hitler's sterilization policy as "a great thing" that "will do away with many of the disgusting specimens of men." &lt;ref name=nyt.gordon&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Meryl|title='Rosemary: The Hidden Kennedy Daughter,' by Kate Clifford Larson |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/books/review/rosemary-the-hidden-kennedy-daughter-by-kate-clifford-larson.html|accessdate=October 13, 2015|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that "Hitler is building a spirit in his men that could be envied in any country."&lt;ref name=jpost&gt;{{cite news|last=Honig|first=Sarah|title=Another Tack:Movie Musings |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Another-Tack-Movie-musings|accessdate=October 13, 2015|newspaper=Jerusalem Post|date=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vf&gt;{{cite news|last=Beauchamp|first=Cari|title=Two Sons, One Destiny|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/12/kennedy-200412|accessdate=October 13, 2015|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Navy (1941–1944) ==
Kennedy left before his final year of law school at Harvard to enlist in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] on June 24, 1941.&lt;ref name="navsource.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/05/850.htm|title=Destroyer Photo Index DD-850 USS JOSEPH P. KENNEDY, JR.|website=Navsource.org|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered flight training to be a [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]], and after training, he received his wings and was commissioned an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] on May 5, 1942.&lt;ref name="navsource.org"/&gt; He was assigned to Patrol Squadron 203 and then Bombing Squadron 110.&lt;ref name="navsource.org"/&gt; In September 1943, he was sent to Britain and became a member of Bomber Squadron 110, Special Air Unit ONE, in 1944. He piloted land-based [[B-24 Liberator|PB4Y Liberator]] patrol bombers on [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] details during two tours of duty in the winter of 1943–1944. Kennedy had completed 25 combat missions and was eligible to return home. He instead volunteered for an [[Operation Aphrodite#Mission theory|Operation Aphrodite mission]].{{r|Sorensen 1966}}

=== Operations Anvil and Aphrodite ===
[[Operation Aphrodite]] (U.S. Army Air Corps) &amp; Operation Anvil (U.S. Navy) made use of unmanned, explosive-laden Army Air Corps [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] and Navy [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated PB4Y-1 Liberator]] bombers that were deliberately crashed into their targets under [[radio control]].{{r|Sorensen 1966}} These aircraft could not take off safely on their own, so a crew of two would take off and fly to {{convert|2000|ft|m|-1}} before activating the remote control system, arming the detonators, and parachuting from the aircraft.

Kennedy was appointed a [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] on July 1, 1944.&lt;ref name="navsource.org"/&gt; After the U.S. Army Air Corps operation missions were drawn up on July 23, 1944, Lieutenants Wilford John Willy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://valor.militarytimes.com/hero/21633|title=Wilford John Willy |website=Hall of Valor Project |accessdate= September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kennedy were designated as the first Navy flight crew. Willy, who was the executive officer of Special Air Unit ONE, had also volunteered for the mission and "pulled rank" over [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] James Simpson, who was Kennedy's regular co-pilot. Kennedy and Willy (co-pilot) flew a BQ-8 "robot" aircraft (drone; a converted B-24 Liberator) for the U.S. Navy's first Aphrodite mission. Two [[Lockheed Ventura]] mother planes and a [[Boeing B-17]] navigation plane took off from [[RAF Fersfield]] at 1800 on August 12, 1944. Then the BQ-8 aircraft, loaded with {{convert|21170|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of [[Torpex]], took off. It was to be used against the U-boat pens at [[Heligoland]] in the [[North Sea]].{{r|Freeman}}&lt;ref name="Baugher"/&gt;
[[File:Last photo taken of Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. on August 12, 1944.png|thumb|Last photograph of Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. on day of flight, August 12, 1944.]]

[[File:Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. (grave).jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative headstone of Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].]]

Following them in a [[USAAF]] [[de Havilland Mosquito|F-8 Mosquito]] to film the mission were pilot Lt. Robert A. Tunnel and combat camera man Lt. David J. McCarthy, who filmed the event from the [[perspex]] nose of the aircraft.{{r|Hansen}}  As planned, Kennedy and Willy remained aboard as the BQ-8 completed its first remote-controlled turn at {{convert|2,000| ft|m |abbr=on}} near the North Sea coast. Kennedy and Willy removed the safety pin, arming the explosive package, and Kennedy radioed the agreed code ''Spade Flush'', his last known words.  Two minutes later (and well before the planned crew bailout, near [[RAF Manston]]), the [[Torpex]] explosive detonated prematurely and destroyed the Liberator, killing Kennedy and Willy instantly. Wreckage landed near the village of [[Blythburgh]] in [[Suffolk]], England, causing widespread damage and small fires, but there were no injuries on the ground. According to one report, a total of 59 buildings were damaged in a nearby coastal town.

According to USAAF records, the trailing Mosquito "was flying 300 feet above and about 300 yards to the rear of the robot. Engineer photographer on this ship was injured, and the ship was damaged slightly by the explosion."&lt;ref&gt;Telegram to AWW, cipher, Top Secret, August 17, 1944, Project Aphrodite box, Air Force Historical Research Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mosquito, which made an immediate emergency landing at [[RAF Halesworth]], belonged to the [[325th Reconnaissance Wing]], a unit under the command of the son of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], then Colonel [[Elliott Roosevelt]]. Years later, Roosevelt claimed to have been aboard this trailing aircraft, and his version of the event has gained wide currency.{{r|Searls}} However, Air Force records cannot substantiate this. Instead, an after-action account by the 8th Combat Camera Unit (CCU) noted that:

McCarthy reported from his hospital bed.&lt;ref&gt;8th AAF CCU unit history for August 1944, 25-GP-HI (Recon), AFHRA&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 8th CCU film of the event, has, so far as is known, not been found.

&lt;ref&gt;NARA College Park MD 20 FG Mission Reports.&lt;/ref&gt;
The 20th Fighter Group out of King's Cliffe was tasked with providing escort to the Aphrodite mission.  Escort consisted of P-51s out of the 55th and 79th Fighter Squadrons, each squadron provided two aircraft. VIII FC, Field Order 509 stated "20 GP (P-51's, 4 A/C) will proceed to Fersfield and land coordinating with operations where to provide close escort support to one B-34 special Operation."

Lt John E. Klink reported in this mission summary report  "Took off to excort BXXX, 1 B24, 1 B17, 2 B34s, and 3 photo Recons (2 Mosq. -1 P38). When specially loaded B24 was at approx.. 2000 ft. NE of Ipswich it exploded and crashed near small lake. No one got out of of the plane. Rest of ships OK in spite of terrific concussion from explosion.  All returned to base." [Sic]

The Navy's informal board of review, discussing a number of theories, discounted the possibility of the crew making a mistake or that suspected jamming or a stray signal could have armed and detonated the explosives. An electronics officer, Earl Olsen, who believed the wiring harness had a design defect, had warned Kennedy of this possibility the day before the mission, but he was ignored.{{r|Renehan 2002}} Kennedy and Willy were both [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]], the [[Air Medal]], and the [[Purple Heart Medal]].

The names of both men are listed on the Tablets of the Missing at the [[Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial]], a cemetery and chapel near the village of [[Madingley]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], Britain, that commemorates American servicemen who died in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fold3.com/page/529902218-wilford-j-willy/facts Fold3 entry for Wilford J Willy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abmc.gov/node/493282#.W5m2SLjZC00 American Battle Monuments Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;
Later reports that Kennedy's final mission were kept top secret until many years later{{r|Olsen}} are negated by a detailed public account of the operation and Kennedy's death released in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', August 15 and 17, 1944 (announcement of Kennedy's death) and October 25, 1945 (detailed account of the mission)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Navy Cross citation===
{{quote|The President of the United States of America takes pride in presenting the Navy Cross (Posthumously) to Lieutenant Joseph Patrick Kennedy, United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism in operations against the enemy while serving as Commander of a Navy Liberator Patrol Plane in Bombing Squadron ONE HUNDRED TEN (VB-110), Special Air Unit ONE (Europe), during a special air mission directed at Mimoyecques, France, on August 12, 1944. Well knowing the extreme dangers involved and totally unconcerned for his own safety, Lieutenant Kennedy unhesitatingly volunteered to conduct an exceptionally hazardous and special operational mission. Intrepid and daring in his tactics and with unwavering confidence in the vital importance of his task, he willingly risked his life in the supreme measure of service, and, by his great personal valor and fortitude in carrying out a perilous undertaking, sustained and enhanced the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=21302|title=Valor awards for Joseph Patrick Kennedy|website=Valor.militarytimes.com|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
In 1946, the Navy named a [[destroyer]] for Kennedy, the {{USS|Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.|DD-850|6}}, aboard which his younger brother, (future [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]]) [[Robert F. Kennedy]], briefly served. Among the highlights of its service are the blockade of [[Cuba]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962 and the afloat recovery teams for ''[[Gemini 6]]'' and ''[[Gemini 7]]'', both 1965 [[Human spaceflight|manned spaceflight]]s in [[NASA]]'s [[Gemini program]]. It is now a floating museum in [[Battleship Cove]], [[Fall River, Massachusetts]].

In 1947, the Kennedys established the [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation]] and funded the construction of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Memorial Hall at [[Boston College]], now a part of [[Lynch School of Education|Campion Hall]] and home to the college's [[Lynch School of Education]]. The foundation was led by his youngest brother, U.S. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], until his death in August 2009. In 1957, the [[Lieutenant Joseph Patrick Kennedy Junior Memorial Skating Rink]] was opened in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts]], with funds from the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation.

In 1969, [[Hank Searls]] wrote a biography of Joe Jr., entitled ''The Lost Prince: Young Joe, the Forgotten Kennedy''. [[Young Joe, the Forgotten Kennedy|A television movie]] based on Searls' book won a [[primetime Emmy]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076943/|title=Young Joe, the Forgotten Kennedy|date=September 18, 1977|accessdate=October 2, 2017|website=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), he won [[NBA Finals|NBA championship]]s in 2009 and 2010 and was named the [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award|NBA Sixth Man of the Year]] in 2011.

As a high school player, Odom received national player of the year honors from ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' in 1997. He played [[college basketball]] for the [[Rhode Island Rams men's basketball|University of Rhode Island]], earning all-conference honors in his only season in the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]].  He was drafted in the first round of the [[1999 NBA draft]] with the fourth overall pick by the [[Los Angeles Clippers]].  He was named to the [[NBA All-Rookie Team]], but twice he violated the league's drug policy in his four seasons with the Clippers. He signed as a [[Restricted free agent (NBA)|restricted free agent]] with the [[Miami Heat]], where he played one season in 2003–04 before being traded to the Lakers. Odom spent seven seasons with the Lakers, who traded him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in 2011. After the move, his career declined. He was traded back to the Clippers in 2012 and played briefly in Spain in 2014.

Odom played on the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States national team]], winning a bronze medal in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] in 2004 and a gold medal in the [[FIBA World Championship]] (known later as the World Cup) in 2010.

Odom was married to [[Khloé Kardashian]] from 2009 to 2016. During their marriage, Odom made several appearances on the [[reality television]] show, ''[[Keeping Up with the Kardashians]]''. He and Kardashian also had their own reality series, ''[[Khloé &amp; Lamar]]''.

In October 2015, Odom fell into a coma and was hospitalized with life-threatening medical problems. Odom has since recovered from his health scare and obtained drug treatment.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Early life==
Odom was born in [[South Jamaica, Queens]], New York City, to Joe Odom and Cathy Mercer.&lt;ref name=jenkins_03232009/&gt; His father was a [[heroin]] addict, and Odom's mother died of [[colon cancer]] when he was twelve years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2011-04-11/lamar-odom-reveals-that-his-father-is-a-heroin-addict | title = Lamar Odom reveals that his father is a heroin addict | work = [[Sporting News]] | date = April 11, 2011 | accessdate = September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/news/story?id=6389586|title=Lakers' Lamar Odom top sixth man| first= Dave | last= McMenamin| publisher=[[ESPN (United States)|ESPN]]|date=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At her deathbed, Odom's mom told him: "Be nice to everybody".&lt;ref name=jenkins_10152015/&gt; Afterwards, he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Mildred Mercer.&lt;ref name=jenkins_03232009&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.si.com/vault/2009/03/23/105789399/another-sunny-day-in-lamars-la |title=Another Sunny Day In Lamar's L.A. |last1=Jenkins |first1=Lee |date=March 23, 2009 |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first three years of high school, Odom played for [[Christ The King Regional High School]] in [[Middle Village, New York|Middle Village]], Queens.&lt;ref name=weiss_11012008/&gt; He left the school at the start of his senior year due to poor grades,&lt;ref name=jenkins_03232009/&gt; transferring first to Redemption Christian Academy in [[Troy, New York]] and then to the now-defunct St. Thomas Aquinas High School in [[New Britain, Connecticut]], where he was coached by [[Jerry DeGregorio]].&lt;ref name=weiss_11012008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/1998/11/01/1998-11-01_odom_is_on_right_rhode_to_su.html |title=Odom Is On Right Rhode To Success |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101173333/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/1998/11/01/1998-11-01_odom_is_on_right_rhode_to_su.html|archive-date=November 1, 2008 | last1=Weiss |first1=Dick |date=November 1, 1998 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=starwave&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espn-i.starwave.com/nba/draft99/players/profiles/odom_lamar.html | title=Lamar Odom: 1999 NBA Draft Tracker | work=ESPN.COM | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619094053/http://espn-i.starwave.com/nba/draft99/players/profiles/odom_lamar.html | archive-date=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a senior, Odom was recognized nationally as the [[Parade High School Basketball Player of the Year|''Parade'' Player of the Year]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1997-03-28/sports/18038473_1_all-star-hoops-auburn-hills|title=Odom Steering College Course|publisher=New York Daily News|first= Anthony | last= McCarron|date=March 28, 1997|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was named to the [[Parade All-America Boys Basketball Team|''Parade'' All-American]] First Team for the second consecutive year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Odom Is Player of Year |date=March 27, 1997 |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/27/sports/odom-is-player-of-year.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cJFThDGX?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/27/sports/odom-is-player-of-year.html |archivedate=October 16, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned ''[[USA Today]]'' All-USA 1st Team honors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/highschool/awards/5/12|title=High School Basketball Awards|publisher=RealGM.com|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his youth, Odom was teamed with future NBA players [[Elton Brand]] and [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]] (later known as Metta World Peace)--each of whom would become teammates with Odom in the NBA--on the same [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/columns/story?id=4871463 |title= Lakers' Ron Artest looking, feeling like old self |publisher= ESPN.com |first= Dave | last= McMenamin |date=January 30, 2010|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played with future Lakers teammate [[Kobe Bryant]] at [[Adidas ABCD]] camps.&lt;ref name=jenkins_03232009/&gt; Adidas executive [[Sonny Vaccaro]] commented at the time that Odom possessed a "$2 million smile".&lt;ref name=cacciola_10152015/&gt;

==College career==
Odom contemplated entering the NBA directly out of high school, and consulted with Bryant, who had made the jump a year earlier. He decided he was not ready, and decided to attend the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels men's basketball|University of Nevada at Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name=jenkins_03232009/&gt; However, after a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' report questioned his unexpectedly high score of 22 out of 36 in the [[American College Testing|ACT]], the school released him in July 1997 before he ever played a game for them. That same summer, he received a citation for soliciting prostitution following an undercover operation by the Las Vegas police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/1997/Aug-19-Tue-1997/news/5912511.html |title=Odom cited for soliciting prostitution|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |first=Glen |last=Pruitt |date=August 19, 1997 |accessdate=July 23, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040227045741/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/1997/Aug-19-Tue-1997/news/5912511.html |archivedate=February 27, 2004 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, an [[NCAA]] inquiry found Odom received payments amounting to $5,600 from booster David Chapman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2000/Mar-15-Wed-2000/news/13173026.html |title=NCAA reveals inquiry of UNLV |last1=Carp |first1=Steve |date=March 15, 2000 |work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coach [[Bill Bayno]] was fired and UNLV was placed on probation for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.courant.com/2000-12-13/features/0012131907_1_bill-bayno-unlv-booster-umass |title=UNLV Gets Probation, Bayno Fired|first=Jeff | last= Goldberg| work=[[Hartford Courant]] |date=December 13, 2000|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Odom transferred to the [[Rhode Island Rams men's basketball|University of Rhode Island]] but was forced to sit out the 1997–98 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/features/1998/preview98/seasonglance/ |title=CNN/SI 1998 College Basketball Preview |publisher=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]] |first=Dan |last=Shanoff |accessdate=December 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229034354/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/features/1998/preview98/seasonglance/ |archivedate=February 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted as a [[Matriculation#Special student|non-matriculating student]], and was not allowed to play [[Intramural sports|intramural]] basketball.&lt;ref name=jenkins_03232009/&gt; His room and board was paid for by his father, who was covered by the [[G.I. Bill]]. After two semesters and a summer session, Odom earned his eligibility to play basketball.&lt;ref name=weiss_11012008/&gt; His career at Rhode Island had been in jeopardy after the first semester, when he vanished before finals. However, Rhode Island coach [[Jim Harrick]] persuaded three of his four instructors to allow him to make up his work. The coach also had Odom work with DeGregorio, who had become a Rams assistant and was the player's closest friend in college.&lt;ref name=jenkins_03232009/&gt;&lt;ref name=weiss_11012008/&gt; Odom was also inspired by his maternal grandmother, a nurse who had raised five children and returned to school to earn her degree in 1980 at age 56.&lt;ref name=weiss_11012008/&gt;

Odom played one season for the Rams in the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]], where he averaged 17.6 points per game and led the Rams to the conference championship in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hoopsblog.projo.com/2010/01/former-uri-bask-1.html#.Tvt_fUqU5ls| title=Former URI basketball star Lamar Odom Is Living His Dream|work=[[The Providence Journal]] |first= Robert | last= Lee|date=January 31, 2010|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned first-team all-conference honors and was named the Atlantic 10 Rookie of the Year.

==Professional career==

===Los Angeles Clippers (1999–2003)===
[[File:Lipofskydotcom Lamar Odom-13052.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Odom with the Clippers.]]
Odom declared his eligibility for the [[1999 NBA draft]] after his freshman year at the [[Rhode Island Rams men's basketball|Rhode Island]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1999_3139644/rhode-island-s-odom-declares-for-nba-draft.html|title=Rhode Island's Odom declars for NBA Draft|work=Houston Chronicle|date=May 18, 1999|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then tried to return to college, thinking he was not ready for the NBA; however, had already signed with an agent and was no longer eligible to withdraw from the draft.&lt;ref name=jenkins_10152015&gt;{{cite news|last=Jenkins|first=Lee|title=The gifts and ghosts of Lamar Odom|date=October 15, 2015|work=Sports Illustrated|url=https://www.si.com/nba/2015/10/15/lamar-odom-lakers-clippers-rhode-island-new-york|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018012257/http://www.si.com/nba/2015/10/15/lamar-odom-lakers-clippers-rhode-island-new-york|archivedate=October 18, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odom was selected by the [[1999–2000 Los Angeles Clippers season|Los Angeles Clippers]] with the fourth overall pick.&lt;ref name=mourning&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2606637|title=Lakers' Odom still mourning sudden death of infant son|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season with the Clippers, Odom averaged 16.6 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game, including 30 points and 12 rebounds in his NBA debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199911020LAC.html|title=Seattle SuperSonics at Los Angeles Clippers Box Score, November 2, 1999|publisher=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named to the 2000 NBA All-Rookie First Team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usabasketball.com/bios/odom_lamar.html|title=USA BAsketball: Lamar Odom|publisher=USABasketball.com|date=September 15, 2010|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2000–01 Los Angeles Clippers season|2000–01 season]], Odom increased his scoring average to 17.2 points a game as he started in 74 games.  The Clippers failed to make the playoffs again however, as the young team could not improve their positioning in the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]].

He would only play in 49 games during the [[2002–03 Los Angeles Clippers season|2002–03 season]], and would be a restricted free agent the following summer. The [[2003–04 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] offered a deal that the Clippers declined to match after already matching another offer the Heat made to [[Elton Brand]].

===Miami Heat (2003–2004)===
The Heat had previously won only 25 games, but had drafted young talent such as [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Caron Butler]].  Odom was brought in to play as the team's starting power forward, and along with the budding Wade and veteran [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] shared the scoring load with 17.1 points a game to go with a career high 9.7 rebounds. The Heat opened the season losing 7 straight games, but ended up playing better and competing for a seed in the playoffs. On March 6, Odom posted a triple double, scoring 30 points with 19 rebounds and 11 assists in a home win against the [[2003–04 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]]. The Heat would go on to the clinch the 4th seed in the [[2004 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], facing off the [[2003–04 New Orleans Hornets season|New Orleans Hornets]] in the first round.

Odom would, however, be invited back for the national team's run at the [[2010 United States men's FIBA World Championship team|2010 FIBA World Championship]] in Istanbul, Turkey where the U.S. would win gold for the first time since 1994.&lt;ref name="Worlds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nba.fanhouse.com/2010/09/12/durant-leads-team-usa-to-first-worlds-gold-since-1994/|title=Durant Leads Team USA to First Worlds Gold Since 1994|publisher=AOL.com|author=Chris Tomasson|date=September 12, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Odom, being one of the elder statesmen on a young U.S. squad, served as a mentor for many of the younger players&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lakersblog.latimes.com/lakersblog/2010/09/lamar-odoms-participation-in-2010-fiba-world-championships-could-prove-critical-in-early-season.html|title=Lamar Odom's Participation in 2010 FIBA World Championships Could Prove Critical in Early Season|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Mark Medina|date=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even played out of position at center for the tournament.&lt;ref name=LAT /&gt; He led the U.S. in rebounds and finished the FIBA championships with double-doubles in the semi-final&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/game/p/gid/A/grid/77/rid/6947/sid/4728/_/2010_FIBA_World_Championship/statistic.html|title=archive.fiba.com: 2010 FIBA World Championship|publisher=FIBA.com|date=September 11, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and championship games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/game/p/gid/A/grid/80/rid/6948/sid/4728/_/2010_FIBA_World_Championship/statistic.html|title=archive.fiba.com: 2010 FIBA World Championships|publisher=FIBA.com|date=September 12, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while becoming the first player in history to win both an NBA championship and FIBA gold in the same year.&lt;ref name=Worlds /&gt;

==Player profile==

He could start a fast break with an outlook pass, finish it with a layup, or simply drive from coast to coast for a dunk.&lt;ref name=medina_04192011/&gt; Though he was a reserve on the Lakers championship teams, he typically finished games in place of starter [[Andrew Bynum]].&lt;ref name=ding_10142015/&gt;

Odom was cooperative with the media, and provided both thoughtful and open responses.&lt;ref name=howard-cooper_10142015/&gt;

'''Lorimar-Telepictures Corporation''' was an entertainment company established on April 21, 1986 with the merger of [[Lorimar Television|Lorimar Productions]] and [[Telepictures Corporation]]. Its assets included television production and [[television syndication|syndication]] (which operated under the Lorimar-Telepictures name), feature films, home video, and broadcasting.

==History==
The merger of Lorimar-Telepictures was announced on October 7, 1985, by [[Merv Adelson]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0ewdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jmIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6143,4739853&amp;dq=lorimar-telepictures&amp;hl=en "Lorimar in Merger."] ''[[The Pittsburgh Press]]'' (October 7, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1986/05/12/67553/index.htm "A TV TITAN WAGERS A WAD ON MOVIES Lorimar-Telepictures makes a ton of money producing and distributing such TV hits as Dallas and The People's Court. Unsatisfied, chief Merv Adelson is trying to expand in theatrical films. The profits are potentially huge -- but a lot less certain."] ''[[CNN Money]]'' (May 12, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 1986, the merger was complete. [[Lee Rich]], one of the other founders of Lorimar, sold his shares in 1986 and left the company. On January 11, 1989, Warner Communications acquired Lorimar-Telepictures after shaking off the hostile takeover of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Warner Completes Merger With Lorimar Telepictures|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-12/business/fi-413_1_lorimar-telepictures-corp|accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a long-term member of parliament representing [[Phrae Province|Phrae]], leader of the [[United Thai Party]] and the [[Justice Unity Party]].

== Life and career ==
Narong Wongwan was born in Phrae, where his grandfather had acquired a fortune from wood production. Narong studied economics in the United States. After working for the family's saw mill for some time, he went into tobacco growing and curing in the 1950s. During the 1970s the tobacco business in Northern Thailand boomed and Narong became a multi-millionaire. Many peasants of Phrae and the neighbouring provinces were employed on Narong's and his family's plantations and in their curing plants. Therefore, he accumulated considerable economic and social influence in the region. This was used by him as a base for his political career. 

Narong was a member of Phrae's provincial council as early as 1949. He founded the [[United Thai Party]] and was elected member of parliament in 1979. He was steadily re-elected in all elections until 1992. He joined the government of prime minister [[Prem Tinsulanonda]], becoming deputy interior minister in 1980, deputy minister of agriculture in 1981, rising to be minister in 1983. After the election of 1986, his party was in the opposition. In 1989, he merged his party with three minor parties and renamed it [[Solidarity Party (Thailand)|Solidarity Party]]. After a cabinet reshuffle, the party became part of [[Chatichai Choonhavan]]'s government coalition and Narong was again made minister of agriculture.&lt;ref name="PasukSungsidh"/&gt; 

After the coup d'état of 1991 and ahead of the [[Thai general election, March 1992|election in March 1992]], he joined with other provincial businessmen, bureaucrats and supporters of the military coup group to form the [[Justice Unity Party]], of which he became the chairman. The party won the election and Narong was designated prime minister, when media alleged that the United States had refused him entry admission due to the suspection of involvement in drug trafficking.

'''About Produce Marketing Association                                 '''

The '''Produce Marketing Association''' ('''PMA''') is a global [[trade association]] whose 2200 members represent the full [[supply chain]] of the [[produce]] and mass-market floral industry, from seed producer to [[supermarket]] or [[foodservice]] outlet.  It was founded in 1949.  Mike O'Brien of Schnucks Markets in St. Louis, MO is the current chairman of the board of directors.  The CEO is Bryan Silbermann, and the president is Cathy Burns.  PMA sponsors an annual convention and exposition called Fresh Summit. 

PMA has 2,900-member companies in 54 countries. The company focuses on the five-following member needs: Demand Creation, Global Connections, Science &amp; Technology, Industry Talent and Sustainability.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pma.com/about-pma/history|title=History|website=www.pma.com|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''History:''' Formed in 1949 during the inaugural National Conference on Prepackaging, PMA (then Produce Prepackaging Association) was led by Paul B. Dickman and aimed to revolutionize the produce industry by delivering member networking and educational opportunities.

In 1958, official headquarters moved from New York to Newark, Delaware, with Robert Carey as Executive Secretary. This marks a turning point for the organization.

The organization officially changed its name to Produce Marketing Association in 1970. This is when PMA created three operating division to address increasing member demand for services: retailer, producer and distributor.

In 1974 PMA joined the floral industry when it formed the Floral Marketing Division to represent mass-market floral members.

The Produce Electronic Identification Board (PEIB) was created by PMA in 1987 to administer standardized Price Look-Up (PLU) codes. The following year, in 1988, PMA joined with United Fresh &amp; Vegetable Association to establish the Center for Produce Quality.

In 1989 Bob Carey became President of PMA after three decades of service to the association.

PMA.com was launched in 1995, establishing the association as an online destination for produce industry members. By taking advantage of new communications technologies to connect to members worldwide, the association could now provide 24-hour access to information and create a virtual trade show.

In 1996 Bryan Silbermann succeeded Bob Carey as President and CEO. During his time with PMA Bryan Silbermann helped standardize PLU/UPC codes, spearheaded the Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI), began the import-export committee that became the International Trade Committee to Global Strategy and Development committees. Silbermann also helped institute the Produce for Better Health (PBH) program, FNV, Center for Produce Quality, Center for Produce Safety and Partnership for Food Safety Education, along with many other achievements during his time with PMA.

PMA initiated the Pack Family/Career Pathways Program in 2004, which would later be re-named the Center for Growing Talent.

In 2017 Cathy Burns succeeded Bryan Silbermann as CEO of PMA. Burns currently holds the CEO position at PMA.

'''Public Square''' is the two-block (formerly four-block) [[town square|central plaza]] of [[downtown Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. Based on an 18th-century [[New England]] model, it was part of the original 1796 town [[plat]] overseen by [[Moses Cleaveland]], and remains today as an integral part of the city's center. The {{convert|10|acre|ha|adj=on}} square is centered on the former intersection of [[U.S. Route 6 in Ohio|Superior Avenue]] and [[U.S. Route 422|Ontario Street]].&lt;ref name=ech&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=PS6 |title=Public Square |work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]] |date=July 30, 1999 |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland's three tallest buildings, [[Key Tower]], [[200 Public Square]] and the [[Terminal Tower]], face the square.

Other Public Square landmarks include the 1855 [[Old Stone Church (Cleveland)|Old Stone Church]] and the former [[Higbee's]] department store made famous in the 1983 film ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', which reopened as the [[Jack Cleveland Casino|Horseshoe Casino Cleveland]] on May 14, 2012. The square was redeveloped in 2016 by the city into a more pedestrian-friendly environment with green space on the northern half of the square, a hard surface on the southern half of the square, and transit lanes on a newly constructed Superior Avenue (which is open only to bus traffic).

A {{convert|125|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (Cleveland)|monument to Civil War soldiers and sailors]] occupies the southeast section of the square. City founder [[Moses Cleaveland]] and reformist mayor [[Tom L. Johnson]] each have statues on the square.

==History==
[[File:Public square postcard.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard of Public Square in the 1910s]]

Public Square was part of the [[Connecticut Land Company]]'s original plan for the city, which were overseen by [[Moses Cleaveland]] in the 1790s. The square is signature of the layout for early New England towns, which Cleveland was modeled after. While it initially served as a common pasture for settlers' animals, less than a century later Public Square was the height of modernity, when in 1879 it became the first street in the world to be lit with electric [[street light]]s, [[arc lamp]]s designed by Cleveland native [[Charles F. Brush]].&lt;ref name=ech /&gt; The square was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on December 18, 1975.

A parking lot now faces the northwest quadrant of the square. A 12-story building, which was built on the spot in 1913, was demolished in 1990 to make way for the new Ameritrust Center, an {{convert|1197|ft|m|adj=on}} [[skyscraper]] designed by New York's [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=103095 Emporis.com: Ameritrust Center]. Accessed December 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Before construction began, Ameritrust  was acquired by [[Key Bank|Society Bank]], which was also planning to construct and subsequently relocate to a new building on Public Square—Key Tower (formerly known as Society Center). Because Society did not need two skyscrapers, plans for the Ameritrust building across the square were scrapped.

Other buildings that face the square include [[55 Public Square]] (1958), [[75 Public Square]] (1915), the [[Society for Savings Building]] (1890), [[Metzenbaum Courthouse]] (1910), the former [[May Company Ohio|May Company]] department store (1914), the [[Park Building (Cleveland, Ohio)|Park Building]] (1903), and the [[Renaissance Cleveland Hotel]] (1918). The demolished [[Cuyahoga Building]] (1893) and [[Williamson Building]] (1900) formerly stood on the site of 200 Public Square.

Public Square is often the site of political rallies and civic functions, including a free annual [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] concert by the [[Cleveland Orchestra]]. At the [[Balloonfest '86]], close to 1.5 million balloons rose up from Public Square, engulfing the Terminal Tower and setting a world record.&lt;ref name="clevelandcom811"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cleveland.com/remembers/index.ssf/2011/08/balloonfest_1986_the_spectacle.html | title=Balloonfest 1986, the spectacle that became a debacle: Cleveland Remembers | work= [[The Plain Dealer]] |location= Cleveland | date=August 15, 2011 | accessdate=March 15, 2014 | author=Kroll, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s renovation===
In collaboration with landscape architect [[James Corner]], the city in 2009 began to explore concepts for a redesign of the square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Redesigning Public Square |url=http://www.downtownclevelandalliance.com/page/Public-Square.aspx?parent=34 |publisher=Downtown Cleveland Alliance |accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Litt |title=Re-imagining Cleveland's Public Square |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/architecture/2009/12/reimagining_clevelands_public.html |work= The Plain Dealer |location= Cleveland |date=December 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Cleveland mayor [[Frank G.

'''Ramiro L. Colón''' (1904&amp;ndash;1983), was the general manager of the [[Cafe Rico|Cooperativa de Cafeteros de Puerto Rico]]. He reorganized the company during its time of crisis and is credited with having saved the [[coffee]] [[industry]] in [[Puerto Rico]].

==Early years==
Colón (birth name: '''Ramiro L. Colón Colón'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Colón'''|'''Colón'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibliotecadigital.uprrp.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/ELM4068&amp;CISOPTR=1043&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=4 ''Senador Ramiro L. Colón junto a panel que discutió sobre cooperativas agrícolas.''] Biblioteca Digital Puertorriqueña. Retrieved 13 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.de.gobierno.pr/sites/de.gobierno.pr/files/report-card/52548_Perfil.pdf ''Perfil Escolar de la Escuela Elemental Ramiro Colón Colón.'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Puerto Rico Department of Education. San Juan, Puerto Rcio. 16 March 2010. Retrieved 13 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;), was born in and raised in the countryside of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]]. There he received his [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]]. Being raised in the country, he developed an intense love for the island's [[agriculture]]. He went to work for the "Cooperativa de Cafeteros de Puerto Rico" ([[Cooperative]] of Coffee Growers of Puerto Rico) in 1925, the same year it was founded, at the age of 21.

=="Cooperativa de Cafeteros de Puerto Rico"==
The cooperative was the first one of its kind in Puerto Rico. It was founded to protect the coffee industry, which was one of the island's most important [[export]] [[product (business)|product]]s, from outside imitators. The situation was the following: many [[merchant]]s were importing coffee from other countries, of poor quality and freshness, and passing them off as locally produced.  When tourists and local consumers tasted the coffee, they complained about how bad it was, and as a result sales declined drastically and the coffee industry suffered greatly.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;[http://www.caferico.com/history-frames.htm Company History]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, [[1928 Okeechobee Hurricane|hurricane San Felipe]] destroyed most of the coffee [[plantation]]s on the island, and the [[Great Depression]] also affected the economy.

==Colón becomes general manager==
In 1932, Colón was named general manager of the cooperative and undertook the reorganization of the company during its time of crisis. The cooperative was almost [[bankrupt]], and the first thing Colón did was to obtain a loan from the Department of Agriculture and [[Commerce]]. With the money, he bought new equipment to replace the old and outdated equipment in the company.  Colón was able to convince the Puerto Rican [[legislature]] to pass a law against the then-rampant [[adulteration]] and [[contraband]] of coffee.

=="Cafe Rico"==
Colón was credited with convincing the government to impose [[import tariff]]s on coffee, thereby ensuring the island would not be invaded by cheap coffee of poor quality, which often was advertised as locally produced. The cooperative purchased and installed a new [[torrefaction]] [[physical plant|plant]] in which the local coffee was processed. Colon set out to gain access to the United States coffee market, helped the local coffee growers obtain lines of [[credit (finance)|credit]] from local bankers, and got financial help from the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] and [[local government]] for the export of the cooperative's coffee. This coffee was named "[[Cafe Rico]]" and was well received locally and internationally, soon reestablishing the good fame of Puerto Rico's coffee worldwide. The cooperative became the first coffee manufacturer to sell its coffee in sealed cans. The quality of Cafe Rico has received numerous medals and recognitions in contests celebrated all over the world.&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt; Colón established the only coffee tasting [[laboratory]] in Puerto Rico.  One of Cafe Rico's byproducts, "San Carlos Selection", is the official coffee of [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt;

==Cooperative expansion==
Under Colon's leadership, the cooperative was able to expand and diversify.  The company sells food and agricultural equipment with sales of over $5 million.  It also owns and operates an [[egg (food)|egg]] processing company which calls its product "Huevos Rico" (Rico Eggs). The cooperative owns an [[insurance]] company, its own credit [[corporation]] that grants loans to [[farmer]]s, and its own [[printing]] plant that prints and distributes an agricultural [[magazine]] worldwide.  Recently, the cooperative has started to operate [[gasoline station]]s in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Mayaguez, Puerto Rico|Mayaguez]] and Ponce.&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt;

When Colón took over the company in 1932 as a general manager the cooperative had only $284,000 in annual sales.  By 1963 the cooperative had over $35,000,000 in sales. The cooperative has [[office]]s and [[warehouse]]s in Ponce (main offices), San Juan, Mayagüez, [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|Arecibo]], [[Yauco, Puerto Rico|Yauco]], [[San Sebastián, Puerto Rico|San Sebastian]], [[Utuado, Puerto Rico|Utuado]], [[Adjuntas, Puerto Rico|Adjuntas]], [[Jayuya, Puerto Rico|Jayuya]] and [[Ciales, Puerto Rico|Ciales]].&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Colón served as a senator, representing the district of Ponce in the [[Puerto Rican Senate]] and was named [[Administration (business)|Administrator]] of the cooperative, a position he held until his retirement in 1965. In 1952 the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] was adopted, creating the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Colón was a member of the [[Constitutional Convention of Puerto Rico]]. He was a delegate to [[Republican National Convention]] from Puerto Rico in the years 1948, 1952 and 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/collinsworth-combest.html#0091EV93A Political Graveyard]&lt;/ref&gt; Ramiro L. Colón was candidate for governor in 1968 for the Republican Statehood Party.

Ramiro L. Colón died in the city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], which honored his memory by naming an elementary school after him. He is remembered as the man who saved the Puerto Rican coffee industry.&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt;

'''Raymond G. Stokes''' [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] [[Academy of Social Sciences|FAcSS]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acss.org.uk/fellows/fellows-institution/  Fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences].&lt;/ref&gt; (Born 1956, [[Pittsburgh]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.piper.de/autoren/raymond-g-stokes-4245 Author Page (in German)].&lt;/ref&gt; is an American academic [[historian]] and the current Chair of [[Business History]] and Director of the Centre for Business History in Scotland at the [[University of Glasgow]].

==Early life==
Raymond G. Stokes was born in 1956. He holds a Ph.D from the [[Ohio State University]].

==Career==
Stokes taught at [[Case Western Reserve University]] and the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], where he received [[academic tenure|tenure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abh-net.org/raystokes.html Ray Stokes ABH Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/research/economicsocialhistory/businesshistory/aboutus/chairofbusinesshistory/  Chair of Business History]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he joined the University of Glasgow.

Stokes has been the President of the [[European Business History Association]], the Editor-in-Chief of the Zeitschrift für Untenehmensgeschichte, and served on the Council of the [[Association of Business Historians]]. Currently, he is Editor-in-Chief of the leading journal in the field, [[Business History (journal)|Business History]]. He is the author or co-author of seven books, some of which have been written in, or translated into, German.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/staff/raymondstokes/  Staff Page].&lt;/ref&gt;

Stokes is the director of the Centre for Business History in Scotland (CBH), Scotland’s only research unit in the discipline, with 13 full members engaged in teaching and research. The prime objective of the CBH is to encourage, facilitate and conduct research in all aspects of business history, with particular emphasis on corporate governance, innovation and organisational change. CBH was established following thirty years of investment in business history, which culminated in 1987 in the founding and funding of centre and library within the Department of Economic and Social history at Glasgow University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abh-net.org/history.html  History of ABH].&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Slaven was appointed as the inaugural Director of the Centre, also holding the Chair in Business History. Notably, CBH was one of the first permanently funded research centres, and consequently independent of the need to secure funds by accepting commissioned business histories. Stokes succeeded Slaven upon the latter's retirement in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/research/economicsocialhistory/businesshistory/aboutus/ About the Centre for Business History]&lt;/ref&gt;

His research interests are primarily in German Business History, in particular business during the [[Third Reich]], and comparisons of technology, innovation and the environment in Germany and America from 1933 to 1990. Most recently he has made headlines for a project examining the links between [[Thalidomide]] and [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-15891994 'Thalidomide's Nazi links examined', BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Bonner''', [[LL.B.]] (September 10, 1920 &amp;ndash; August 12, 2005) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[lawyer]], [[politician]], and [[corporation|corporate]] executive.  He pursued his career working in the [[British Columbia]] government and in B.C.-based companies.

Bonner was born and raised in [[Vancouver]], and served with the [[Seaforth Highlanders]] in [[Italy]] in the [[Second World War]].  Upon his return to Canada, Bonner took a law degree from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1948, and joined a practice in [[Vancouver]].  Active in politics from an early age, Bonner became a supporter and confidant of [[W.A.C. Bennett]], who would go on to lead the [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit Party]] to victory in the [[British Columbia general election, 1952|1952 provincial election]].  To the surprise of many, Bennett appointed the unelected, 32 year-old Bonner as the province's [[Attorney General of British Columbia|Attorney General]] &amp;mdash; the youngest in B.C.'s history.  Bonner would be elected to represent the riding of [[Vancouver-Point Grey]] in the [[British Columbia general election, 1953|provincial election of 1953]], which was also the first Social Credit majority government in the province. He would retain the position of Attorney General for the next sixteen years, quickly becoming one of the most powerful ministers and closest advisors to Bennett in the Socreds' long spell of governance.

Bonner's tenure as Attorney General was marked by legal clashes with [[First Nations]] tribes over land and resource rights, especially in light of the rapid [[hydroelectric]], [[mining]], and [[forestry]] development of the province's hinterland.  Perhaps more significantly, from a historical perspective, was the provincial government's conflicts with the [[Freedomites|Sons Of Freedom]], an anti-government sect of [[Doukhobors]] resident in the [[Kootenays|Kootenay]] region of the province.  Clashes over [[public education]] led to the apprehension en masse of Freedomite children, and their confinement in government schools.

During his time in cabinet, Bonner also served at various times concurrently as Minister of Education and Minister of Trade and Commerce.  In the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|legislature]], Bonner proved capable, serving as Bennett's [[House Leader]].  Contemporaries described him as "articulate, urbane, and always well prepared, with a demonstrated air of superiority and a ready laugh."[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Infoparl/english/issue.htm?param=104&amp;art=516]

Bonner left provincial politics in 1968 to become vice-president of [[MacMillan Bloedel]], a Vancouver-based [[logging]] and [[lumber]] company.  He would later go on to become the firm's president and [[chief executive officer]].  Bonner left Mac Blo in 1976 to become chairman of [[BC Hydro]], the provincial [[crown corporation]] responsible for producing and supplying hydroelectric power.  He retired from that position in 1985.

Bonner died in Vancouver in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5658">In September 2006, the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) of the United States issued '''Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 157''': Fair Value Measurements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fasb.org/pdf/aop_FAS157.pdf SFAS No. 157]&lt;/ref&gt;), which “defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.”  This statement is effective for financial reporting fiscal periods commencing after November 15, 2007 and the interim periods applicable.

==Defining "fair value"==
Paragraph 5 of SFAS No. 157 (now known as ASC 820 in the updated FASB Codification) defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.”  Of note, this Statement requires consideration of the exit price paid (if liability) or received (if asset) in a hypothetical transaction in an orderly market (i.e., not a forced liquidation or sold under duress).  

This Statement also introduces two more concepts to the definition of fair value – the Principal (or Most Advantageous) Market and Highest and Best Use. 

Principal (or Most advantageous) Market – Fair Value Measurement assumes the hypothetical transaction occurs in a principal market, “the market in which the reporting entity would sell the asset or transfer the liability with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability.”  In the absence of a principal market, the asset or liability is assumed to be transferred in the most advantageous market, “the market in which the reporting entity would sell the asset or transfer the liability with the price that maximizes the amount that would be received for the asset or minimizes the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability, considering transaction costs in the respective market(s).”

Highest and Best Use – Fair Value Measurement assumes the asset is being utilized in a manner that will maximize its value.  For example, where a company owns a factory, but the property would have a higher value as a residential lot, the asset should be fair valued as a residential lot.

==Establishing a framework for measuring fair value==
The concept of the Fair Value Hierarchy there for is introduced in paragraphs 22 through 31 in SFAS No. 157.  To provide the financial statement user with more insight into the valuation techniques and to create comparability among financial statements, SFAS No. 157 requires the fair value assets and liabilities to be allocated to [[Wikinvest:Level_1,_Level_2,_Level_3_Assets | different levels or hierarchies]] based on the transparencies of the inputs to valuing the assets/liabilities.  

Level 1, the highest on the hierarchy, indicates assets/liabilities with the most transparent and tangible valuation techniques.  A Level 1 financial instrument typically has quoted prices and active markets – for example, an equity stock.  This type of instrument has the most verifiable and reliable fair value measurement.

Level 2 instruments require more involvement in valuing than Level 1 instruments.  Level 2 “inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.”  For example, an interest rate swap uses known, public data, such as interest rates and the contract terms can be used to calculate a value of the interest rate swap.  The instrument can be valued indirectly using observable data.  Another example would be using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level 3 is the most unobservable of the levels and indicates use of valuation techniques and data that may not be verifiable.  These types of instruments involve a great deal of assumptions and estimates.  Examples may include infrequently traded asset backed securities or investments in privately owned companies

==Expanding disclosures==
SFAS No. 157, paragraph 32 requires two main types of disclosures – a Fair Value Balance Sheet and a Level 3 Rollforward.

The Fair Value Balance Sheet is similar to a typical balance sheet by disclosing the value of the assets and liabilities as of a specific date.  However, the Fair Value Balance Sheet only includes financial instruments and uses fair value (concept defined above) as of a specific date.  Additionally, the Fair Value Balance Sheet is segregated into the three fair value hierarchies described above – Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.

The Level 3 Rollforward reconciles the Level 3 balances for assets and liabilities from the prior reporting period to the current reporting period.  This reconciliation must include the total gains and losses (realized and unrealized) for the period, the purchase, sales, issuances, and settlements (net), the transfers in and/or out of Level 3.  These components should reconcile the prior period’s balance to the current period’s balance.

These are the two main tables disclosed, but additional information is required such as description of the valuation techniques, significant transfers between levels, etc.  Additionally, various regulatory bodies, such as the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA), and other groups within the FASB, will issue further guidelines on SFAS No. 157 disclosures.

'''Sebastiano Montelupi''' ({{lang-pl|Sebastian Montelupi}}, name occasionally Polonized as ''Wilczogórski'', 1516 – 18 August 1600),&lt;ref name="Jagiełło"/&gt; was an Italian-born merchant and banker in [[Kraków]], Poland, and [[Postmaster]] General of the Polish royal postal service under [[Sigismund II Augustus]], [[Henry III of Poland]], [[Anna Jagiellon]], [[Stephen Báthory]] and [[Sigismund III Vasa]].

==Life==
Montelupi left Italy in 1536, settling in the [[Kingdom of Poland (Jagiellonian)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1557. He worked for the merchants and bankers Carlo and Bernardo Soderini until establishing himself independently in partnership with his younger brother Carlo.&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt;
[[File:Dom Włoski.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Montelupi House (now a hostel) on the main square in Kraków]]In 1567 he married the teenaged Urszula, daughter of doctor of medicine [[Wojciech Baza]] (died 1569),&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt; physician to the court.&lt;ref name="Lisowski"/&gt; The year after the wedding the couple moved into a ''[[Kamienica (architecture)|kamienica]]'' residence in the centre of Kraków, rebuilt in the Renaissance style. This building, known as the [[Italian House]] or Montelupi House, also served as the central post office. Urszula was to die without surviving issue on 12 July 1586, aged 35, after 19 years of marriage.&lt;ref name="Starowolski"/&gt; At one point [[Francesco Pucci]] had consulted [[John Dee]] on Montelupi's behalf, to determine whether their childlessness could be due to witchcraft.&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt;

==Career==
As a merchant, Montelupi traded with Italy, Germany, England, Austria and Russia. As a banker, his clients included the [[Apostolic Nuncio to Poland|papal nuncios at the Polish court]].&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt; In 1574, the city reimbursed Montelupi a little over ''[[Polish złoty#First z.C5.82oty|fl]]''.1,827 for his contributions to the ceremony of receiving and performing hommage to the new king, Henry III; these contributions included a yard and a half of red Chinese cloth for the dish holding the keys to the city, and a number of [[vermeil]] vessels and a large silver vase that were presented to the king.&lt;ref name="Fournier"/&gt; In 1581 Montelupi advanced ''fl''.3,000 to King Stephen Báthory to help finance that year's [[Siege of Pskov|campaign against Muscovy]].&lt;ref name="Fournier"/&gt; Towards the end of his life he became court banker to King Sigismund III, and consul of the Italian community in the capital.&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt; In the 1580s he funded the publication of work by the Franciscan writer [[Annibale Rosselli]].&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt; He died in Kraków on 18 August 1600, aged 84,&lt;ref name="Starowolski"/&gt; leaving an estate valued at ''fl''.150,000.&lt;ref name="goldthwaite"/&gt; He was succeeded by his nephew and adopted heir, [[Valerio Tamburini Montelupi]] (Walerian Montelupi, 1548–1613), who thus became the richest citizen in Kraków.&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt;

===Master of the Royal Post===
From 1568 Montelupi was postmaster general of the [[Polish Royal Post]] (succeeding [[Pietro Maffon]]), running one public service to [[Vilnius]] (in three weeks) and another to Vienna and Venice (in ten days).&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt; These services were suspended in 1572 and when resumed in 1574 were reserved for the carriage of royal messages. In 1583 he was confirmed as royal postmaster general by the new king, Stephen Báthory, on condition he maintain public deliveries between the major cities of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and an international service to and from Venice at least twice each month. His position enabled Montelupi to provide high-level information services for correspondents including the [[Medici]] in Florence and the [[Fugger]] in Augsburg.&lt;ref name="nachrichtenverkehr"/&gt;

At Sebastiano's death the postmastership also passed to his nephew Valerio, and in time to Valerio's descendants, the last postmaster of the dynasty being [[Carlo Montelupi de Mari]] (Karol Montelupi, died 1662).&lt;ref name="Montelupi"/&gt; Another Italian, [[Angelo Maria Bandinelli]], then became royal postmaster general.&lt;ref name="Bandinelli, Roberto"/&gt;

==Commemoration==
A magnificent monument to Sebastiano Montelupi and his wife Urszula was erected in [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków]]. The work has been attributed to the workshop of Italian-Polish architect and sculptor [[Santi Gucci]].&lt;ref name="Rudzinski"/&gt;

A street in Kraków is named after his family, as is his [[kamienica (architecture)|kamienica]], and [[Montelupi Palace|a palace]] built by his descendants.&lt;ref name="pudlowski"/&gt;

In 2008 a commemorative stamp set celebrating the 450th anniversary of the Polish postal service was issued, featuring portraits of [[Prosper Provano]] and Sebastiano Montelupi.&lt;ref name="Joystamps"/&gt; The portrait of Montelupi was based on the effigy incorporated into the Montelupi monument.

''Intelligent transportation systems'' usually refers to the use of information and communication technologies (rather than innovations in the construction of the roadway) in the field of road transport, including infrastructure, vehicles and users, and in traffic management and mobility management, as well as for interfaces with other modes of transport.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:207:0001:0013:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photovoltaic pavement ==
Photovoltaic pavement is a form of pavement that generates electricity by collecting [[solar power]] with [[photovoltaics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matej Lufčić|author2=Marina Maras|author3=Mario Vukelić|title=Energy Saving Design and Materials in Road Transport|url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/540022.Energy_saving_design_and_materials_in_road_transport.doc|accessdate=23 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524041829/http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/540022.Energy_saving_design_and_materials_in_road_transport.doc|archivedate=24 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parking lots, footpaths, driveways, streets and highways are all candidate locations where this material could be used.

The [[Jinan]] solar highway opened in China in December 2017 along a 1.2 mile stretch. It uses [[transparent concrete]] on the top layer with the solar panels underneath. It was the second solar roadway in the city, the first opened in September 2017 using a different technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://electrek.co/2017/12/21/china-solar-roadways-transparent-concrete-solar-cells-charge-cars/ |title=China is building solar roadways – ‘transparent concrete’ atop solar cells that charge driving cars |work=Electrek |author=John Fitzgerald Weaver |date=December 21, 2017 |accessdate=January 15, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116135255/https://electrek.co/2017/12/21/china-solar-roadways-transparent-concrete-solar-cells-charge-cars/ |archivedate=January 16, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/30/china-opens-1-kilometer-long-solar-road/ |title=China Opens 1-Kilometer Long Solar Road |work=CleanTechnica |author=Steve Hanley  |date=December 30, 2017 |accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar Road Panels===
The main purpose of solar roadways is to replace asphalt roads with Solar Panels which generate energy through the sun that can be used by local houses or businesses that are connected to the system from either the house’s driveway or the businesses parking lot. The panels will also increase the number of charging stations for electric cars if that station is connected to the solar roadway. Each panel is roughly 12’ by 12’ of interlocking panels that have their own LED lights that will be used as the road lines, and can also be used to spell out words like “Reduce Speed” or “Traffic Ahead” to help the flow of traffic.&lt;ref name = Ranjan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ranjan|first1=Rajeev|title=Solar Power Roads: Revitalising Solar Highways, Electrical Power and Smart Grids|journal=International Journal of Engineering Research and General Science|date=January–February 2015|volume=3|issue=1|pages=380–385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 3 layers that make up the solar panels:

1. The Road Surface Layer - The Road Layer is the High Strength layer that has the photovoltaic cells which attracts the sun’s rays, it has traction so vehicles don’t slide off the road, and it’s waterproof to protect the layers below.&lt;ref name = Ranjan/&gt;

2. The Electronic Layer - The Electronic Layers contain a mini microprocessor board that helps control the heating element of the panels, this technology can help melt the snow that lands on the panels so that hazardous road conditions will no longer be an issue in the more northern regions. This layer can sense how much weight is on the panels and can control the heating element to melt the snow.&lt;ref name = Ranjan/&gt;

3. The Base Plate Layer - The Base Plate Layer is the layer that collects the energy from the sun and distributes the power to the homes or businesses that are connected to the solar roadways. This will also be used to transfer the energy to cars as they drive over the strip to recharge the battery.&lt;ref name = Ranjan/&gt;

===Criticism===
''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine stated that solar roadways would produce less electricity than solar cells that are placed at an angle, and that less light would touch them because of shade, dirt covering the road, and cars blocking the sun from touching the panels. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2017/12/solar_roads_are_almost_definitely_not_the_future.html|title=What Is the Point of a Solar Road?|first=Neel V.|last=Patel|date=December 28, 2017|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have pointed out that solar roadways would be both more expensive, and less productive than more conventional ways of combining solar power with infrastructure, such as building shelters over roads and parking areas and putting traditional solar panels on the roofs; [[Elon Musk]] demonstrated that there is ample space in the US, apart from roads, to fulfill the power requirements of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.equities.com/news/elon-musk-demonstrates-why-solar-roadways-would-be-really-silly|title=Elon Musk Demonstrates Why Solar Roadways Would be Really Silly|last=equities.com|work=Equities.com|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart pavement===
The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) began testing out “smart pavement” at a rest stop outside of Conway, Missouri along historic Route 66 late in 2016. The pilot program currently covers about 200 square feet of sidewalk at the visitor center and cost $100,000 (Landers), largely subsidized by the Federal Highway Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cronkleton|first1=Robert A.|title=Missouri’s solar roadways to begin with sidewalk at historic Route 66 Welcome Center|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article93755517.html|accessdate=20 April 2017|agency=Kansas City Star|date=August 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511125201/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article93755517.html|archivedate=11 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It’s all part of Missouri’s Road to Tomorrow initiative to find new innovations in their transportation infrastructure. Missouri wants to take advantage of these roadways to implement other, related technologies. The panels will heat the road and keep snow and ice from accumulating. They will also feature LED diodes that will increase the visibility of road lines. The LEDs would also double in helping prevent paint from inhibiting solar power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landers|first1=Jay|title=Missouri to Test Solar Roadways, Smart Pavement as Part of Road to Tomorrow Project|journal=Civil Engineering—ASCE|date=2016|volume=86|issue=9|pages=30–31|url=http://cedb.asce.org/CEDBsearch/record.jsp?dockey=0352321|accessdate=20 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504172325/http://cedb.asce.org/CEDBsearch/record.jsp?dockey=0352321|archivedate=4 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panels have not had enough time to determine durability, energy efficiency, or cost effectiveness in a real world sense yet, so MoDOT has not reach any conclusions about feasibility and future application yet.

==Wireless vehicle charging==
{{See|In-road electric vehicle charger|Inductive charging|Wireless power transfer}}

The [[Online Electric Vehicle]] being developed by [[KAIST]] (the &amp;nbsp;Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) has electrical circuits built into the road which will power suitably adapted vehicles via contactless [[electromagnetic induction]]. A pilot system powering electric buses is under development. Germany's [[IAV#In-road electric vehicle charger|IAV]] is another company that is developing induction chargers.

===Electromechanical batteries===
Roadway-powered electric vehicle system is the patent held by Howard R. Ross. It has several components. The first of which is an all electric vehicle that would be fit with electromechanical batteries that accept a charge from the road. The road is the second component and would have strategically placed charging coils as to only charge the car when needed. These cars and roads would not require gas or solar power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=H.R.|title=Roadway-Powered Electric Vehicle System|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US5669470|website=Google Patents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowhere in the world is an invention like this currently implemented, and this is due to the cost of the infrastructure overhaul that would be needed to bring this patent into reality.

== Road markings ==
[[File:Glowing Lines Roosegaarde.jpg|thumb|Glowing Lines, Studio Roosegaarde]]
The ''Smart Highway'' concept developed by [[Studio Roosegaarde]] and the infrastructure management group [[Heijmans]] in the Netherlands incorporated [[Photoluminescence|photo-luminescent]] paint for road markings, which absorb light during the day then glow for up to 10 hours. The technology was demonstrated on a stretch of highway in [[North Brabant|Brabant]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Liat |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-10/30/smart-highway-glows-in-the-dark |title=Netherlands highways will glow in the dark from mid-2013 (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530095727/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-10/30/smart-highway-glows-in-the-dark |archivedate=2014-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27021291 |title=Glow in the dark road unveiled in the Netherlands |publisher=BBC |date=2014-04-14 |accessdate=2014-06-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703073055/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27021291 |archivedate=2014-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frost protection and melting snow, ice ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3827">In the business of [[insurance]], '''statutory reserves''' are those assets an insurance company is legally required to maintain on its [[balance sheet]] with respect to the unmatured obligations (i.e., expected future claims) of the company. Statutory reserves are a type of [[actuarial reserve]].

==Purpose==
Statutory reserves are intended to ensure that insurance companies are able to meet future obligations created by insurance policies. These reserves must be reported in statements filed with insurance regulatory bodies. They are calculated with a certain level of conservatism in order to protect policyholders and beneficiaries.&lt;ref name=Klugman295&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Stuart A. |editor-last=Klugman |first1=Jeffrey A. |last1=Beckley |first2=Patricia L. |last2=Scahill |first3=Matthew C. |last3=Varitek |first4=Toby A. |last4=White |title=Understanding Actuarial Practice |publisher=[[Society of Actuaries]] |year=2012 |page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
There are two types of methods for calculation of statutory reserves. Reserve methodology may be fully prescribed by law, which is often called formula-based reserving. This is in contrast to principles-based reserves, where [[actuaries]] are given latitude to use professional judgment in determining methodology and assumptions for reserve calculation.&lt;ref name="Klugman295"/&gt; In the United States, where formula-based reserves are used, the [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners]] plans to implement principles-based reserves in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Principle-Based Reserving (PBR) Implementation Plan |date=23 March 2015 |url=http://www.naic.org/documents/committees_ex_pbr_implementation_tf_150323_pbr_implementation_plan.pdf |publisher=[[National Association of Insurance Commissioners]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life insurance in the United States==
In the U.S. [[life insurance]] industry, statutory reserves are most commonly computed using the [[Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method]], or CRVM, the method prescribed by law for computing minimum required reserves.

The size of a CRVM reserve, as with most life reserves, is affected by the age and sex of the insured person, how long the policy for which it is computed has been in force, the plan of insurance offered by the policy, the rate of interest used in the calculation, and the [[mortality table]] with which the [[actuarial present value]]s are computed.

The Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method was itself established by the Standard Valuation Law (SVL), which was created by the [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners|NAIC]] and adopted by the several states shortly after World War II. The first mortality table prescribed by the SVL was the 1941 CSO (Commissioner's Standard Ordinary) table,&lt;ref&gt;The 1941 CSO table was prescribed for policies of ''ordinary'' life insurance. For policies of ''industrial'' life insurance the SVL prescribed use of the 1941 CSI (Commissioner's Standard Industrial) table.&lt;/ref&gt; at a maximum interest rate of 3½%. Subsequent amendments to the Standard Valuation Law have permitted the use of more modern mortality tables and higher rates of interest. The effect of these changes has in general been to reduce the amount of the reserves which life insurance companies are legally required to hold.

'''TIAA Bank Center''' is a [[skyscraper]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], USA. Standing 447 feet (136 m) tall,&lt;ref name="EMP"/&gt; it is the city's [[List of tallest buildings in Jacksonville|third-tallest building]], as well as the largest in terms of class "A" rentable area with {{convert|956201|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=LOOP&gt;[http://www.loopnet.com/property/15130996/301-West-Bay-Street/] LoopNet Office Property For Lease, AT&amp;T Tower&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly known as the '''Southern Bell Telephone Building''', the '''AT&amp;T Tower''', and '''EverBank Center''', it took its former name in 2012 when [[EverBank]] moved employees into the building and acquired signage rights.&lt;ref name=Mathis&gt;{{cite news |title= EverBank to move Downtown, AT&amp;T Tower 301 becomes EverBank Center|author= Karen Brune Mathis |url= http://jaxdailyrecord.com/showstory.php?Story_id=535190&amp;mailer=20111219|newspaper= Financial News &amp; Daily Record |date= December 19, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=citynotes&gt;{{cite news |title= City Notes 6/29/2012 |author= |url= http://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/citynotes.php?id=536852 |newspaper= Financial News &amp; Daily Record |date= June 29, 2012 |accessdate=July 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is currently called [[TIAA Bank]] Center, although no formal announcement has been made, and signage changes have not been completed, as of EverBank's rebranding, effective on June 4, 2018.

==History==

The building was designed by [[KBJ Architects]] and opened in 1983.&lt;ref name=EMP /&gt; It takes up an entire city block in Jacksonville's downtown. A notable feature of the structure is that each floor has 16 corner offices.&lt;ref name=SKY&gt;[http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=3751] Skyscraper Page.com, Jacksonville, Florida, AT&amp;T Tower&lt;/ref&gt; The building was constructed on the former site of the Hotel Mayflower.&lt;ref name=EMP /&gt;

The tower was built for the [[Southern Bell]] Telephone company. The following year, [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]] (AT&amp;T) was forced to divest its regional phone companies and Southern Bell became a unit of [[BellSouth]]; the signage was changed to reflect the new name. In 2006 AT&amp;T re-acquired BellSouth and the signage was changed back to AT&amp;T in 2008.&lt;ref name=JAX904&gt;Trinidad, Alison (January/February 2009). ''[[Jacksonville Magazine's 904]]'', pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[CSX]] vacated space it had rented in the tower, leaving it mostly empty. Later that year the City of Jacksonville finalized a deal with [[EverBank]], in which the bank received tax incentives to relocate over 1,200 employees into the building and add 200 new jobs. EverBank took over nine floors and acquired the naming rights to the tower, which was renamed EverBank Center. Employees moved into the building in summer 2012, with signage installed in September and October.&lt;ref name=Mathis/&gt;&lt;ref name=citynotes/&gt;

==Details==
The entrance to the building features a two-story atrium.&lt;ref name=CNL&gt;[http://www.cnl.com/commercialRealEstate/att/] [[CNL Commercial Real Estate]], Properties, AT&amp;T Tower&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 280-seat auditorium on the second level and a backup power system for the entire building. The [[JTA Skyway]] central station is across the street and an adjoining seven-level parking garage has spaces for 641 vehicles.&lt;ref name=LOOP /&gt; The building was purchased in 2004 by [[El-Ad Group|El Ad Florida]] for $91 million.&lt;ref name=JAX904 /&gt; In 2014 the building was acquired by Amkin Real Estate, a privately owned real estate investment company based in Miami, FL.

{{nihongo|'''''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'''''|ワイリー&amp;ライトのRockBoard ザッツ*パラダイス}} is a spin-off [[video game]] title in the original ''[[Mega Man (original series)|Mega Man]]'' series from [[Capcom]]. It is a [[business simulation game]] that is similar to [[board game]] [[Monopoly (game)|''Monopoly'']], in which players and the computer [[artificial intelligence|AI]] take turns going around a set of connected squares, buying up [[property]], and charging other participants [[renting|rent]] when they land on those spaces.

''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard'' was released on January 15, 1993 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] only in [[Japan]], though an unreleased English translation and a [[Game Boy]] version may have been in development. Critical reception for the game from Western gaming websites has been decidedly poor.

==Gameplay==
''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'' is a [[business simulation game]] in which the player chooses among several characters in the [[Mega Man (original series)|original ''Mega Man'' series]] and competes with other players or the computer AI in purchasing spaces of [[property]]. The characters include [[Roll (Mega Man)|Roll]], [[Dr. Light (Mega Man)|Dr. Light]], [[Doctor Wily|Dr. Wily]], [[Dr. Cossack]], and [[Kalinka Cossack|Kalinka]].&lt;ref name="bigref"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Rockman Big Reference Book | publisher=[[Capcom]] | date=Spring 1993 | title=''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That’s Paradise'' | language=Japanese | pages=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher"&gt;{{cite web | author=Fletcher, JC | date=November 29, 2007 | title=Virtually Overlooked: ''Wily &amp; Right no Rockboard: That's Paradise'' | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/11/29/virtually-overlooked-wily-and-right-no-rockboard-thats-paradise/ | publisher=[[Joystiq]] | accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each participant is given a turn, moving a certain number of spaces on the board. If they land on a property square, they are given the option to buy it with a certain about of Zenny (the game's currency).&lt;ref name="fletcher"/&gt; They can then charge other characters [[Renting|rent]] when they land on that building. However, other characters can also buy part of the same square, allowing each owner to charge a smaller amount of rent. Some squares contain cards that cause various effects on the board such as raising property prices or the development level of a building.&lt;ref name="bigref"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher"/&gt; The game's winning conditions can vary depending on the set rules. The winner may be the character with the most owned spaces, the most remaining Zenny, or the most developments.&lt;ref name="fletcher"/&gt;

==Development==
''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'' was developed by [[Capcom]] during a time when the ''Mega Man'' franchise was at its height of its popularity.&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Nutt, Christian  |author2=Speer, Justin  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The History of ''Mega Man'' | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6076983/p-26.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series artist [[Keiji Inafune]] had very little involvement in the development of ''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'', simply designing the cover art and the new character [[List of Mega Man characters#Reggae|Reggae]].&lt;ref name="r20"/&gt; When developing the game, the team wanted to include as many bosses from previous titles in the series as possible.&lt;ref name="club"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Club Capcom | publisher=[[Capcom]] | date=Spring 1993 | title=''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That’s Paradise'': A Development Team Inside Story | language=Japanese | page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they ultimately decided to leave room for an original character that fans could associate with the new game. When discussing a bird character labeled {{nihongo|''fukou no tori''|フコウノトリ||lit. "bird of misfortune"}}, one of the team members misread it as {{nihongo|''kounotori''|コウノトリ||lit. "[[Oriental stork]]"}}, resulting in Reggae's resemblance to the species.&lt;ref name="club"/&gt;

The January 1993 issue of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] magazine ''[[Club Nintendo]]'' featured ''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard'' as part of a preview article for the 1993 [[Consumer Electronics Show]]. Titling the game as "Mega Board", the article even had a screenshot featuring [[English language|English]] text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Club Nintendo]] | publisher=[[Nintendo]] | page=23 | title=''Mega Board'' | author=Ham, Richard | language=Spanish | date=January 1993 | volume=2 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unreleased [[Game Boy]] version was apparently in the works by the Japanese company Dual, which listed the game on the credits page of its official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title=ja:開発業歴 |trans-title=Development History | url=http://www.dual-inc.co.jp/kaihatu.html  | publisher=Dual | language=Japanese | accessdate=January 30, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070726100055/http://www.dual-inc.co.jp/kaihatu.html |archivedate = July 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]] was responsible for the audio in this version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Hitoshi Sakimoto - Official English Website (Discography) | url=http://sakimoto.cocoebiz.com/discography/index.shtml | publisher=[[Hitoshi Sakimoto]] | accessdate=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{Globalize/USA|section|date=November 2018}}
Critical reception for ''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'' outside Japan has been poor. [[GameSpot]] contributors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer found the relatively obscure game to be of no particular interest to anyone other than ''Mega Man'' fans.&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; Jeremy Parish of [[1UP.com]] summated, "An oddity of the Famicom era, this import title was a simple "[[The Game of Life|''Game of Life'']]"-style board game with a ''Mega Man'' motif -- novel, but hardly essential."&lt;ref name="1up"&gt;{{cite web | author=Parish, Jeremy | date=May 10, 2007 | title=The ''Mega Man'' Series Roundup | url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3159344 | publisher=[[1UP.com]] | accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]] editor Brett Elston called it a "probably better-off-lost excursion into Mega-mediocrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Elston, Brett | date=June 30, 2008 | title=The ultimate ''Mega Man'' retrospective | url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-ultimate-mega-man-retrospective/a-2008062794557758069/p-3 | publisher=[[GamesRadar]] | accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all views of the game have been negative. JC Fletcher of [[Joystiq]] expressed desire for the game's release on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service. He opined that it is "actually nowhere near as terrible as a ''Mega Man'' board game ''should'' be" and that its various effects and winning conditions grant it a much faster pace than [[Monopoly (game)|''Monopoly'']].&lt;ref name="fletcher"/&gt;

'''Workforce modeling''' is the process by which the need for skilled workers at a particular point in time (demand) is matched directly with the availability and preference of [[skilled workers]] (supply).  The resulting mathematical models may be used to perform [[sensitivity analysis]] and generate data output in the form of reports and schedules.

Due to the complexity level of building a workforce model, adoption of a workforce model is usually found in industries that have complex work rules, skilled or certified workers, medium to large teams of workers and fluctuating demand.  Some examples include [[healthcare]], [[public safety]], and retail.

A workforce modeling solution can also refer to software that effectively captures all the complexity of process from start to finish and delivers complete and correct results.  Components include:
*[[Demand management]] – tracking the demand for skilled workers by small units of time (generally 15 or 30 minutes)
*Employee availability – tracking of contractual work hour obligations and limits on an individual basis for each employee
*Employee preference – tracking of preferred times and dates that employees wish to work (used to help increase [[job satisfaction]])
*[[Workflow management]] – ability for the solution to automate normally manual processes such as requesting and approving time off, requesting shift swaps, and generating and posting schedules
*Optimization Engine – uses the mathematical model to create numerous schedules that are complete and correct and can be optimized on many dimensions simultaneously.  The most important are cost, [[overtime]] and [[employee satisfaction]]

==Definition==
For a more detailed definition, the term must be differentiated from traditional staff [[Schedule (workplace)|scheduling]]. Staff scheduling is rooted in [[time management]] and encompasses the mere administration of past and future working times. However, during the last ten to fifteen years, this traditional approach has evolved towards a demand-oriented solution which, under economic aspects, also includes changes in personnel requirements and objectives when optimizing the scheduling of staff. Besides the two core aspects of demand-orientation and optimization, workforce modeling also incorporates the forecast of the workload and the required staff, the integration of employees into the scheduling process through interactivity, the management of working times and accounts as well as analyzing and monitoring the entire process.

Workforce modeling solutions can, and should, be deployed enterprise-wide wherever complex scheduling needs or legal staffing ratios must be met.  Due to the complex nature of a workforce model, creating one by hand is nearly impossible.  By using a software solution for demand-oriented workforce management, planners can optimize staffing by creating schedules that at all times conform as closely as possible to the actual requirement. At the same time, a workforce modeling solution helps users to observe all relevant legislation, local agreements and the contracts with individual employees – including [[work-life balance]] guidelines.

==Complexity of model==
Many workforce modeling solution applications use the more common [[linear programming]] approach to create the Workforce Model. Linear methods of achieving a schedule are generally based on assumptions that demand is based on a series of independent events, all of which have a consistent, predictable outcome.&lt;ref name="Clancy, Thomas R. 2008"&gt;Clancy, Thomas R. ''Managing Organizational Complexity in Healthcare Operations.'' The Journal of Nursing Administration 38.9 (2008): 367-70. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this method is very common, the results are in most cases not as complete or efficient.  In general, they produce a resulting schedule that is up to 75% complete and leaves the scheduler to complete the remaining shift assignments.

[[Heuristics]] have been applied to the problem and [[metaheuristics]] has been identified as the best method for generating complex scheduling solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Edmund, Patrick De Causmaecker, Greet Vanden Berghe, and Hendrik Van Landeghem. ''[https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/123829/1/JOS_ The State of the Art of Nurse Rostering].'' Journal of Scheduling 7.6 (2004): 441-99. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this technique, many more solutions are available to the modeling process resulting in schedules that are not only closer to 100% complete, but are also optimized to many different criteria at the same time.&lt;ref name="Clancy, Thomas R. 2008"/&gt;
