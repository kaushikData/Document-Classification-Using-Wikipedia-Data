'''Abyaneh''' ({{lang-fa|ابيانه}}, also [[Romanize]]d as '''Ābyāneh''', '''Ābiāneh''', and '''Abyāneh''')&lt;ref&gt;{{GEOnet3|-3051725|Abyaneh}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a village in [[Barzrud Rural District]], in the [[Central District (Natanz County)|Central District]] of [[Natanz County]], [[Isfahan Province]], [[Iran]]. At the 2006 census, its population was 305, in 160 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{IranCensus2006|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;ref&gt;{{IranCensus2006|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Characterized by a peculiar reddish hue, the village is one of the oldest in Iran, attracting numerous native and foreign tourists year-round, especially during traditional feasts and ceremonies.

An Abyanaki woman typically wears a white long scarf (covering the shoulders and upper trunk) which has a colourful pattern and an under-knee skirt. Abyunaki people have persistently maintained this traditional costume.

On top of the village sits the ruins of a [[Sasanid]] era fort.

The dialect of the people of Abyaneh has preserved some characteristics of the [[Middle Persian]] language, the language of the [[Sassanian Persia]].

Since June 2005, the village has been undergoing archaeological excavations for the first time ever, as a result of an agreement between [[Abyaneh Research Center]] and the Archaeology Research Center of the [[Iranian Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization]] (ICHTO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranian.ws/iran_news/publish/article_7552.shtml|title=Iranian Resources and Information|publisher=iranian.ws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anna Catherine De Souza''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Emmerdale]]'', played by [[Emma Davies (actress)|Emma Davies]]. She made her first appearance on 8 July 2008 and left on 6 January 2009.

==Character creation and development==

Anna De Souza's arrival was announced in June 2008. ''Emmerdale'' producer [[Anita Turner]] said, "Anna is a really interesting character. She seeks her father’s approval but everyone else must dance to her tune. Anna sees opportunities and goes for them. The King Brothers won't know what's hit them!" and "She's very much harping back to the history of the show... she has hidden depths – it's all about the complexities." &lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a97155/cape-wrath-actress-joins-emmerdale.html Cape Wrath actress joins Emmerdale]", ''Digital Spy''. URL last accessed 2008-07-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress Emma Davies described Anna as an "extremely fun and confident woman" who also has a "vulnerability", and due to her love for the country, is "more [[Kim Tate]] than [[Sadie King]]." In spite of the "superbitch" tag, Davies said Anna was "not a snob" and "not an obvious bitch." &lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a105872/emma-davies-anna-de-souza-emmerdale.html Interview - Emma Davies]", ''Digital Spy''. URL last accessed 2008-07-10&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, Anita Turner announced that Emma Davies would be leaving around the end of 2008, saying, "Emma is a hugely talented actress but Anna's story always dictated a beginning, a middle and an end and that will culminate in dramatic scenes in December, which are being filmed at the moment." &lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a132731/emma-davies-to-leave-emmerdale.html Emma Davies to leave 'Emmerdale']", ''Digital Spy''. URL last accessed 2009-01-01&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies said,

:"The opportunity of playing Anna has been a joy from start to finish. I've enjoyed being part of such a fantastic, hard-working and super talented team. I've made some great friends who I will of course miss very much but I'm excited about getting stuck into filming the culmination of Anna's story."

==Storylines==
Anna was extremely close to her father, [[Donald De Souza]] ([[Michael Jayston]]), while growing up, and helped him build his fortune. When she met Mark, Donald dismissed him as a fortune hunter, but Anna refused to end it. When she married Mark, Donald cut her out of his will and cut off all contact. She ran her own company in [[Dubai]]. Within six years, Mark had spent all Anna's money and was cheating on her. The marriage was over.

Anna was in touch with her brother, [[Miles De Souza|Miles]] ([[Ayden Callaghan]]). He told her about Donald's illness and she realised she had to see him. Anna arrived during Donald's 75th birthday party. She went to Holdgate Farm, looking for him and met [[Carl King]] ([[Tom Lister]]). Carl thought Anna was looking for a job and Anna didn't disillusion him. He told her about her father's birthday party at Home Farm and she went there to see him. At Home Farm, she and Carl bet their cars for whoever hit both targets in skeet shooting. Anna easily hit both targets but told Carl he could keep his car, as she didn't like it very much. After telling her father about the changes in her life, she said she couldn't let him be swayed by Carl the way she'd been swayed by Mark, and to remember Carl's family were their main rivals. Donald listened to her but made Carl Managing Director, telling Anna she had a lot to prove. Anna had no intention of giving up without a fight. She moved in with her father, ostensibly to help her brother, and soon began to clash with Carl.

A few weeks after her return, Anna hired Miles's ex-girlfriend [[Jasmine Thomas]] ([[Jenna Coleman|Jenna-Louise Coleman]]) to work on their website revamp as well as running errands. Unfortunately, her matchmaking efforts backfired when Jasmine's new boyfriend [[List of Emmerdale characters (2007)#Jake Doland|Jake Doland]] ([[James Baxter (actor)|James Baxter]]) laughed at Miles for being so desperate to hire Jasmine to spend time with him. Miles was humiliated by his sister's interference and left town. Anna and Carl's rivalry continued to rage, with them constantly trying to trick and undermine the other. However, it soon became clear that there was a mutual attraction, although neither would admit it.

Things came to a head when Carl, sick of Anna undermining him, played a trick on her to get her back. Anna had been claiming that she wanted to learn De Souza Enterprises from the ground up so Carl let her take a company truck for a test drive. He didn't tell her that the fuel tank was only half full and she was soon stranded when the truck broke down on a country lane in the middle of nowhere. [[Matthew King (Emmerdale)|Matthew King]] ([[Matt Healy]]), Carl's older brother, came to her rescue and was amused by her description of Carl. Anna and Matthew became good friends, sharing a mutual distrust of Carl and an ambitious way of conducting business. Carl was jealous of Matthew and Anna's relationship, and decided to get back with ex-girlfriend, [[Lexi King|Lexi Nicholls]] ([[Sally Oliver]]) to make her jealous. Much to Carl's disappointment, Anna was amused and swiftly began teasing him about his feelings for her. Anna soon had to choose between Carl and Matthew as her relationships with both progressed. It was unclear if Anna was genuinely interested in either, or was playing them off against each other for her own reasons and amusement.

Carl and Anna's frosty partnership came to a sharp end after she had a vicious fight with Donald, and Carl comforted her. The pair saw each other in a different light, and Carl kissed her, seemingly to her surprise. After some initial confusion, she told him she would like a relationship with him but first Carl would have to dump Lexi. However, when Carl tried to end things with her, Lexi revealed she knew he had killed his father, [[Tom King (Emmerdale)|Tom King]] ([[Ken Farrington]]), forcing Carl to stay with her so that she would not tell anyone. Anna was furious and told Carl that he would be sorry for making her look like a fool.

Meanwhile, Matthew also tried to kiss Anna after they closed a successful business deal. However, she pulled away. She admitted that she wanted him but told him they could only have a business relationship, unaware that Carl had not dumped Lexi. Matthew asked if he was supposed to hide his feelings for her, and she replied he would have to if he wanted their current relationship to continue. Undeterred, Matthew continued to chase Anna, despite being turned down a second time. Anna and Carl's rivalry was back, and nastier than ever, with them soon getting into a bidding war for Mill Cottage. Annoyed, Carl complained to Donald, who was incensed to discover Anna was out with Matthew, who he felt was a troublemaker and unsuitable for his daughter. In retaliation, Donald offered to buy Mill Cottage for Carl and Lexi.

Later, Anna guessed that Carl had betrayed De Souza Enterprises by sending a rich client to King and Sons. Disappointed, Donald bought Carl out and he returned to King &amp; Sons. Donald suffered a heart attack due to the stress and another argument with Anna. However, during his recovery in hospital, he and Anna made up, and Donald told Anna that he wanted to sign De Souza Enterprises over to her, even calling his [[Solicitor]] to bring the contract to the hospital. Much to his surprise, Anna tore the contract up and stated her intention to prove herself before taking ownership of the company. Reunited, Donald and Anna began to plot their revenge against the Kings.

Matthew visited Donald in hospital (after sending Carl on a business trip to [[Brussels]]) attempting to clear the air between them, saying they had more to gain by working together than against each other. He also told Anna that he didn't want there to be any bad feeling between them. Donald agreed to discuss Matthew's proposal with Anna but after Matthew left, Donald told Anna she should use Matthew's feelings for her against him. Anna, at first, seemed shocked at his suggestion, asking her father how far she was supposed to go, and showing confusion about the route that their plan for revenge was taking. However, desperate to impress, Anna arranged to meet Matthew, who soon insisted that he take her to dinner, kicking Donald and Anna's plan into action.&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Matt King Anna De Souza01.jpg|thumb|right|Matthew and Anna were no longer able to hide their feelings for each other.]] --&gt;

Anna and Matthew continued spending time together, and she soon had trouble with her feelings for him. Matthew was particularly touched when Anna got him a new watch after his old one was ruined and retrieved the engraving from the old one, as he explained that his father had given him the watch on his 21st birthday and it held a lot of sentimental value. No longer able to deny the chemistry between them, the pair finally slept together, and proceeded to start a secret relationship. Donald, unknowingly, offered Anna's services on a business trip to [[Warsaw]], as a Consultant, thinking Anna could get some valuable inside information about ''King &amp; Sons'' for their revenge plan. What he didn't expect was Anna admitting to him that she had fallen in love with Matthew. A furious Donald shunned Anna, telling her he'd ruin the Kings with or without her help, and kept information that she thought she had destroyed. Matthew told Anna that he returned her feelings, telling her he loved her more than he imagined possible, and they agreed to start again. When Matthew returned to Warsaw to complete the business deal, Donald begged Anna to end her relationship with him and threatened to tell Matthew the reason why Anna got close to him in the first place.

When Matthew returned, Anna knew she had to confess before Donald told Matthew. Angry, Matthew initially dumped her but listened when she insisted she would turn her back on Donald, and asked him to marry her. He happily accepted, and the news was broken to Donald, Carl and [[Jimmy King (Emmerdale)|Jimmy King]] ([[Nick Miles]]). The next day, Matthew proposed to Anna with an antique engagement ring as she moved her belongings to Home Farm. A party was planned, to celebrate both the engagement, and the successful deal with Polek Haulage. Donald crashed the party, announcing to everyone that Anna was only marrying Matthew to ruin the Kings from the inside. Matthew angrily retorted that Donald had tried to buy him off, and convinced his brothers that Donald was lying. Donald threatened Anna that he would disinherit her if she didn't break off the engagement, and she furiously insisted that she choose Matthew, and ordered him to leave. Hating to see his fiancee so upset, Matthew told Anna that the only thing that mattered was them, and planned to confront Donald alone.

Matthew's visit to Donald did not end well, as Donald had a heart attack after Matthew confronted him at Holdgate Farm. Donald began to suffer chest pains but Matthew, thinking he was making it up, refused to give him his medication until he agreed to attend the wedding. Donald made a final plea, and fell to the floor, dead. Matthew, panicked, fled the scene and Donald's body was found the next day by cleaners [[Betty Eagleton]] ([[Paula Tilbrook]]) and [[Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]), who contacted Anna and the authorities.

Devastated, Anna believed her father had died, thinking that she hated him. [[Katie Sugden]] ([[Sammy Winward]]) comforted Anna and told her about the similar circumstances of her father's death. Meanwhile, Matthew confessed to Carl that he was involved in Donald's death. Disgusted that Matthew could keep this from Anna, Carl warned Matthew that the guilt would eat him alive, if he didn't tell Anna. Matthew explained that he was terrified of losing her, and couldn't tell her. Meanwhile, whilst planning her father's funeral, Anna insisted that they continue planning their wedding, as the thought of marrying him was helping her through her grief.

After Donald's death, Anna began helping ''King &amp; Sons'' financially, as she loved Matthew and felt some remorse that she had helped to lure their biggest client away. By the day of the wedding, a creditor had got a court order dissolving ''King &amp; Sons'' and the bailiffs had arrived at Home Farm. Anna gave the bailiffs her car if they would give them 24 hours. The bailiffs agreed. Carl went to see the lawyer, and began believing that Anna and Matthew were working together. He ruined the wedding by revealing Matthew's role in Donald's death. Devastated, Anna left and Matthew and Carl had a fight. Matthew got into a van and tried to run Carl down.  Meanwhile, Katie had gone after Anna and was trying to persuade her to return to the wedding. Anna saw Carl, and demanded answers about her father's death. Matthew was driving towards Carl, but at the last minute, saw Anna was with Carl and swerved to avoid her, crashing into a wall and was catapulted through the windscreen. Despite Jimmy calling an ambulance, Matthew died in Anna's arms, after managing to choke out how much he loved her. Anna was devastated.

The next morning she told Katie she'd come to Emmerdale to mend fences with her father, and instead she'd lost her father and a man she deeply loved. She asked Jimmy and Carl about Matthew and her father's death. An embittered Carl let her believe the worst, but Jimmy told her that Matthew had never meant for Donald to die. Anna left town for two weeks to track down her brother, Miles, and the Kings agreed not to hold the funeral until her return. The Kings heard nothing from Anna during her absence, and finally decided to hold the funeral. Anna returned halfway through the service. A drunken Jimmy lambasted her, but Carl eulogized that Anna had been the first person Matthew had been able to express his love for since their mother's death. At the wake, Carl gave Anna hers and Matthew's wedding rings, and finding closure in their tense relationship, they hugged goodbye.

After the wake, Anna told Katie the company she'd worked for before moving to Emmerdale had asked her to rejoin them. She had an emotional farewell with Katie, thanking Katie for being one of the only people in town who hadn't judged her. As Anna drove away, she saw a distraught Jimmy trying to finish burying Matthew. Her eyes filling with tears, she stopped for a moment but continued on. The last shot was of the flowers Anna had put at Matthew's grave, with a note saying she missed him so much, it was hard to breathe.

[[File:Josaphat.jpg|thumb|300px|A Christian depiction of Josaphat, 12th Century manuscript]]

'''Barlaam and Josaphat''' ({{lang-la|Barlamus et Iosaphatus}}) are legendary Christian martyrs and saints. Their life story may have been based on the life of the [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;John Walbridge ''The Wisdom of the Mystic East: Suhrawardī and Platonic Orientalism'' Page 129  – 2001 "The form Būdhīsaf is the original, as shown by Sogdian form Pwtysfi and the early New Persian form Bwdysf. ... On the Christian versions see A. S. Geden, Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, s.v. "Josaphat, Barlaam and," and M. P. Alfaric, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; It tells how an Indian king persecuted the Christian Church in his realm. When astrologers predicted that his own son would some day become a Christian, the king imprisoned the young prince Josaphat, who nevertheless met the hermit Saint Barlaam and converted to Christianity. After much tribulation the young prince's father accepted the Christian faith, turned over his throne to Josaphat, and retired to the desert to become a hermit. Josaphat himself later abdicated and went into seclusion with his old teacher Barlaam.&lt;ref name="catholic-forum.com"&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden329.htm The Golden Legend: The Story of Barlaam and Josaphat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216150745/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden329.htm |date=16 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale derives from a second to fourth century [[Sanskrit]] [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] text, via a [[Manichaean]] version, then the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''Kitab Bilawhar wa-Yudasaf'' (Book of Bilawhar and Yudasaf), current in [[Baghdad]] in the eighth century, from where it entered into Middle Eastern Christian circles before appearing in European versions.

==Background: the Buddha==
[[File:Battistero di parma, portale sud 03 leggenda di barlaam.JPG|thumb|Depiction of Barlaam and Josaphat at the [[Baptistery of Parma]], Italy]]
The story of '''Barlaam and Josaphat''' or '''Joasaph''' is a [[Christianity|Christianized]] and later version of the story of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], who became the [[buddhahood|Buddha]].&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Barlaam and Josaphat}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages the two were treated as Christian saints, being entered in the [[Greek Orthodox]] calendar on [[August 26 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|26 August]],&lt;ref name="SYNAXARISTES"/&gt; and in the [[Roman Martyrology]] in the Western Church as "Barlaam and Josaphat" on the date of 27 November.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1900"/&gt; In the Slavic tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church, these two are commemorated on [[November 19 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|19 November]]  (corresponding to 2 December on the Gregorian calendar).&lt;ref name=PRAVOSLAVIE&gt;''[http://days.pravoslavie.ru/en/Days/20121119.htm November 19/December 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301081443/http://days.pravoslavie.ru/en/Days/20121119.htm |date=1 March 2014 }}.'' Orthodox Calendar (Pravoslavie.ru).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OCA&gt;''[http://oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&amp;ID=1&amp;FSID=103329 Venerable Joasaph the Prince of India].'' OCA – Feasts and Saints.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Christianized adaptation was the [[Georgian language|Georgian]] epic ''Balavariani'' dating back to the 10th century. A Georgian monk, [[Euthymius of Athos]], translated the story into [[Greek language|Greek]], some time before he was killed while visiting [[Constantinople]] in 1028 {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. There the Greek adaptation was translated into [[Latin language|Latin]] in 1048 and soon became well known in Western Europe as ''Barlaam and Josaphat''.&lt;ref&gt;William Cantwell Smith, "Towards a World Theology" (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek legend of "Barlaam and Ioasaph" is sometimes attributed to the 7th century [[John of Damascus]], but Conybeare argued it was transcribed by the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] monk [[Euthymius of Athos|Euthymius]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;F.C. Conybeare, "The Barlaam and Josaphat Legend in the Ancient Georgian and Armenian Literatures" (Gorgias Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Barlaam and Josaphat was popular in the [[Middle Ages]], appearing in such works as the ''[[Golden Legend]]'', and a scene there involving three caskets eventually appeared, via [[William Caxton|Caxton]]'s English translation of a Latin version, in [[Shakespeare]]'s "[[The Merchant of Venice]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sangharakshita, "From Genesis to the Diamond Sutra – A Western Buddhist's Encounters with Christianity" (Windhorse Publications, 2005), p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Middle High German]] versions were produced: one, the "Laubacher ''Barlaam''", by Bishop [[Otto II of Freising]] and another, ''Barlaam und Josaphat'', a [[Chivalric romance|romance]] in verse, by [[Rudolf von Ems]]. The latter was described as "perhaps the flower of religious literary creativity in the German Middle Ages" by [[Heinrich Heine]].&lt;ref&gt;''Die Blüte der heiligen Dichtkunst im deutschen Mittelalter ist vielleicht »Barlaam und Josaphat«...''  See Heinrich Heine, [http://www.heinrich-heine.net/schule/schuled1.htm Die romantische Schule (Erstes Buch)]  at heinrich-heine.net. {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Josaphat was re-told as an exploration of [[free will]] and the seeking of inner peace through [[meditation]] in the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==The legend==
According to the legend, King Abenner or Avenier in India persecuted the Christian Church in his realm, [[St. Thomas Christians|founded by]] the [[Apostle Thomas]]. When astrologers predicted that his own son would some day become a Christian, Abenner had the young prince Josaphat isolated from external contact. Despite the imprisonment, Josaphat met the hermit Saint Barlaam and converted to Christianity. Josaphat kept his faith even in the face of his father's anger and persuasion. Eventually Abenner converted, turned over his throne to Josaphat, and retired to the desert to become a hermit. Josaphat himself later abdicated and went into seclusion with his old teacher Barlaam.&lt;ref name="catholic-forum.com"/&gt;

==Name==
Ioasaph (Georgian ''Iodasaph'', Arabic ''Yūdhasaf'' or ''Būdhasaf'') is derived from the Sanskrit ''[[Bodhisattva]]''.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1900"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Trainor (ed), "Buddhism" (Duncan Baird Publishers, 2001), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanskrit word was changed to ''Bodisav'' in Persian texts in the 6th or 7th century, then to ''Budhasaf'' or ''Yudasaf'' in an 8th-century Arabic document (possibly Arabic initial "b" ﺑ changed to  "y" ﻳ by [[Arabic alphabet|duplication of a dot]] in handwriting).&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Choisnel Les Parthes et la Route de la soie 2004 Page 202 "Le nom de Josaphat dérive, tout comme son associé Barlaam dans la légende, du mot Bodhisattva. Le terme Bodhisattva passa d'abord en pehlevi, puis en arabe, où il devint Budasaf. Étant donné qu'en arabe le "b" et le "y" ne different que ..."&lt;/ref&gt; This became ''Iodasaph'' in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the 10th century, and that name was adapted as ''Ioasaph'' in Greece in the 11th century, and then was assimilated to ''[[Jehoshaphat|Iosaphat/Josaphat]]'' in Latin.&lt;ref name="D.M. Lang 1957"&gt;D.M. Lang, The Life of the Blessed Iodasaph: A New Oriental Christian Version of the Barlaam and Ioasaph Romance (Jerusalem, Greek Patriarchal Library: Georgian MS 140), BSOAS 20.1/3 (1957):&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feast day==
Although Barlaam and Josaphat were never formally [[canonized]], they were included in earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology (feast day 27 November)&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Choisnel Les Parthes et la Route de la soie 2004 – Page 202 "Dans l'Église grecque orthodoxe, Saint Josaphat a été fêté le 26 août et, dans l'Église romaine, le 27 novembre a été la ... D. M. Lang, auteur du chapitre « Iran, Armenia and Georgia » dans la Cambridge History of Iran, estime pour sa part ..."&lt;/ref&gt; — though not in the [[Roman Missal]] — and in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] liturgical calendar (26 August in Greek tradition etc.&lt;ref name="SYNAXARISTES"/&gt; / 19 November in Russian tradition).&lt;ref name="PRAVOSLAVIE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCA"/&gt;

==Texts==
[[File:Barlaam and Josaphat. English lives of Buddha.djvu|page=9|thumb|180px|A page from the 1896 edition by Joseph Jacobs at the University of Toronto (Click on image to read the book)]]
There are a large number of different books in various languages, all dealing with the lives of Saints Barlaam and Josaphat in [[India]]. In this hagiographic tradition, the life and teachings of Josaphat have many parallels with those of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]. "But not till the mid-nineteenth century was it recognised that, in Josaphat, the Buddha had been venerated as a Christian saint for about a thousand years."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674990388 Barlaam and Ioasaph, John Damascene, Loeb Classical Library 34, Introduction by David M. Lang ]&lt;/ref&gt; The authorship of the work is disputed. The origins of the story seem to be a Central Asian manuscript written in the [[Manichaean]] tradition. This book was translated into [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Arabic]].

===Greek manuscripts===
The best-known version in Europe comes from a separate, but not wholly independent, source, written in [[Greek language|Greek]], and, although anonymous, attributed to a monk named John. It was only considerably later that the tradition arose that this was [[John of Damascus]], but most scholars no longer accept this attribution. Instead much evidence points to [[Euthymius of Athos]], a Georgian who died in 1028.&lt;ref name=loeb&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674990388 Barlaam and Ioasaph, John Damascene], Loeb Classical Library 34, at LOEB CLASSICAL LIBRARY&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern edition of the Greek text, from the 160 surviving variant manuscripts (2006), with introduction (German, 2009) is published as Volume 6 of the works of John the Damascene by the monks of the [[Abbey of Scheyern]], edited by Robert Volk. It was included in the edition due to the traditional ascription, but marked "spuria" as the translator is the Georgian monk [[Euthymius the Hagiorite]] (ca. 955–1028) at [[Mount Athos]] and not John the Damascene of the [[monastery of Saint Sabas]] in the [[Judaean Desert]]. The 2009 introduction includes an overview&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-06-04.html Pieter W. van der Horst, Utrecht – Review of 2006/2009 Robert Volk edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===English manuscripts===
Among the manuscripts in English, two of the most important are the [[British Museum]] ''MS Egerton 876'' (the basis for Ikegami's book) and  ''MS Peterhouse 257'' (the basis for Hirsh's book) at the [[University of Cambridge]].
The book contains a tale similar to The Three Caskets found in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and later in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.&lt;ref name=loeb/&gt;

[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|Burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'', c. 1900]]
A '''burlesque''' is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24999 "Burlesque",] ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burlesco}}'', which, in turn, is derived from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burla}}'' – a joke, ridicule or mockery.&lt;ref&gt;In theatrical use, a burla was "a comic interlude or practical joke introduced, usually extempore, into a performance by the servant masks of the [[commedia dell'arte]] … developed at will into a small independent 'turn', the characters returning at its conclusion to the main theme of the plot". See Hartnoll, Phyllis and Peter Found. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t79.e492 "Burla",] ''The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre'',  Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-90100-43624043/the-new-york-clipper-vol-62-september#fullscreen "Burlesque News – The Growth of Burlesque"], ''[[New York Clipper]]'', Vol. 62, No. 31, September 12, 1914, p. 18 (accessed February 28, 2017, ''via'' [[MyHeritage]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Burlesque overlaps in meaning with [[caricature]], [[parody]] and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with [[extravaganza]], as presented during the [[Victorian burlesque|Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H. W. Fowler|Fowler, H. W.]], rev. [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]] (1965). ''Modern English Usage''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 68 and 96&lt;/ref&gt;  "Burlesque" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are [[Alexander Pope]]'s  ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''.  An example of musical burlesque is  [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].  Examples of [[Victorian burlesque|theatrical burlesques]] include [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' and the [[A. C. Torr]] – [[Meyer Lutz]] shows, including ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.

A later use of the term, [[American burlesque|particularly in the United States]], refers to performances in a [[variety show]] format.  These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in [[cabaret]]s and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female [[striptease]].  Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and 1979's ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'', among others. There has been a resurgence of interest in this format since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sankar-Gorton|first1=Eliza|title=Burlesque Is Back and Here Is What You Need to Know About It|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eliza-sankargorton/burlesque-is-back-and-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-it_b_7176112.html| website=www.huffingtonpost.com|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=30 April 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Petkovic| first1=John| title=Burlesque: Then and now, a timeline of performers from Lili St. Cyr to Dita VonTeese|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2010/11/burlesque_then_and_now_a_timel.html|website=www.cleveland.com|publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=28 November 2010|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary origins and development==
[[File:Arabella-Fermor-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arabella Fermor, target of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'']]
The word first appears in a title in [[Francesco Berni]]'s ''Opere burlesche'' of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as ''poesie bernesca'' in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Fredric Woodbridge Wilson: "Burlesque", ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed December 04, 2008), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Pyramus and Thisbe scene in ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' were early examples of such imitation.&lt;ref name=stanton&gt;Stanton, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet [[Miguel de Cervantes]] ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are ''[[Exemplary Novels]]'' and the ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'' published in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQTtSRP?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570534/burlesque.html Burlesque], ''MSN Encarta'', accessed 18 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick/&gt;

Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with "[[pastiche]]", "[[parody]]", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the "[[mock-heroic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt;

17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: '''High burlesque''' refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary [[Parody#English term|parody]] and the [[mock-heroic]]. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is [[Alexander Pope]]'s "sly, knowing and courtly" ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, pp. 290–91&lt;/ref&gt; '''Low burlesque''' applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is [[Samuel Butler (1612-1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s poem ''[[Hudibras]]'', which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric [[doggerel]] verse, using a colloquial idiom.  Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hudibras'' was so popular that it became the subject of parody itself.  See Sanders, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in [[revue]]s and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].&lt;ref name=stanton/&gt;  [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1974 play ''[[Travesties]]'' is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p. 50; and Hunter, Jim (1982) ''Tom Stoppard's Plays''. London: Faber and Faber, {{ISBN|0-571-11903-4}}, pp. 23–33, 141–146 and 237–242&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
{{see also|Parody music}}

===Classical music===
Beginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect.&lt;ref name=kennedy&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As derived from literature and theatre, "burlesque" was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;

In this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by [[Johann Strauss II]] (''Die lustigen Weiber von Wien'', 1868),&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Strauss, Johann" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Michael Ziehrer|Ziehrer]] (''Mahomed's Paradies'',1866; ''Das Orakel zu Delfi'', 1872; ''Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende'', 1875; ''In fünfzig Jahren'', 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Ziehrer, C. M." in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruno Granichstaedten]] (''Casimirs Himmelfahrt'', 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though [[André Grétry|Grétry]] composed for a "drame burlesque" (''Matroco'', 1777).&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, David and M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43361 "Grétry, André-Ernest-Modeste: Works,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 24 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (''The Fox'') a ''"Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée"'' (''burlesque tale sung and played'') and his 1911 ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' a "burlesque in four scenes". A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by [[Ernst Krenek]] entitled ''[[Schwergewicht]]'' (''Heavyweight'') (1927).

Some orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite ''Burlesque de Quixotte'', TWV 55, by [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and the Sinfonia Burlesca by [[Leopold Mozart]] (1760). Another often-performed piece is [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;  Other examples include the following:
*1901: Six Burlesques, Op. 58 for piano four hands by [[Max Reger]]
*1904: Scherzo Burlesque, Op. 2 for piano and orchestra by [[Béla Bartók]]
*1911: Three Burlesques, Op. 8c for piano by Bartók
*1920: Burlesque for Piano, by [[Arnold Bax]]
*1931: Ronde burlesque, Op. 78 for orchestra by [[Florent Schmitt]]

*1956: Burlesque for Piano and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 13g by [[Bertold Hummel]]
*1982: Burlesque for Wind Quintet, Op. 76b by Hummel

Burlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in [[Partitas, BWV 825-830|Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827)]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], the "Rondo-Burleske" third movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] by [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and the "Burlesque" fourth movement of [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1]].&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, Andrew, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mmzf "Dmitri Shostakovich Violin Concertos 1 &amp; 2 Review"], BBC Music, accessed 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz===
The use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well known [[ragtime]] travesties include ''The Russian Rag'', by [[George L. Cobb]], which is based on [[Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]], and [[Harry L. Alford|Harry Alford]]'s  ''Lucy's Sextette'' based on the [[sextet]], 'Chi mi frena in tal momento?', from ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Donizetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Max (2006): ''Rachmaninoff: Life, Works, Recordings'' p 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian theatrical burlesque==
[[File:Florence St. John.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
{{main|Victorian burlesque}}
Victorian burlesque, sometimes known as "travesty" or "[[extravaganza]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s.  It took the form of [[parody music|musical theatre parody]] in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work.  The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors.  [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Other authors of burlesques included [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;

Victorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English [[pantomime]] "with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early burlesques, following the example of [[ballad opera]], the words of the songs were written to popular music;&lt;ref&gt;Moss,  Harold Gene. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/830406 "Popular Music and the Ballad Opera",] ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 365–82, University of California Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; later burlesques mixed the music of [[opera]], [[operetta]], [[music hall]] and [[revue]], and some of the more ambitious shows had original music composed for them.  This English style of burlesque was successfully introduced to New York in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/779924 "Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850",] ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5–50, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faustupto.jpg|thumb|150px|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]''|left]]
Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera.&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33–66, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wells&gt;Wells, Stanley.

Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told, "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=wells/&gt; A staple of burlesque was the display of attractive women in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]], dressed in tights to show off their legs, but the plays themselves were seldom more than modestly risqué.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

[[File:Ruy-blas-programme-crop.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Souvenir programme|Programme]]: ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'']]
Burlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and [[Royal Strand Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.  Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize.  The house stars included [[Nellie Farren]], [[John D'Auban]], [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  From about 1880, Victorian burlesques grew longer, until they were a whole evening's entertainment rather than part of a double- or triple-bill.&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;  In the early 1890s, these burlesques went out of fashion in London, and the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new more wholesome but less literary genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt.

==American burlesque==
[[File:Bon-Ton Burlesquers2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Advertisement for a burlesque troupe, 1898]]
{{main|American burlesque}}
American burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, [[Lydia Thompson]] and the "British Blondes", beginning in 1868.&lt;ref name=Friends&gt;Hoffos, Signe and Moulder, Bob.  [http://www.kensalgreen.co.uk/documents/FOKGC43_Thompson.pdf "Desperately Seeking Lydia" and "Appreciating Lydia",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513080257/http://www.kensalgreen.co.uk/documents/FOKGC43_Thompson.pdf |date=2011-05-13 }} ''The Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery Magazine'', Vol. 43, Autumn 2006, pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;  New York burlesque shows soon incorporated elements and the structure of the popular [[minstrel show]]s. They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted [[Olio (musical number)|olios]] and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9018177 "Burlesque show",] ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Online Library Edition, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While burlesque went out of fashion in England towards the end of the 19th century, to be replaced by [[Edwardian musical comedy]], the American style of burlesque flourished, but with increasing focus on female nudity. Exotic "cooch" dances were brought in, ostensibly Syrian in origin.  The entertainments were given in clubs and cabarets, as well as music halls and theatres. By the early 20th century, there were two national circuits of burlesque shows competing with the [[vaudeville]] circuit, as well as resident companies in New York, such as [[Minsky's Burlesque|Minsky's]] at the Winter Garden.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

The transition from burlesque on the old lines to striptease was gradual. At first, [[soubrette]]s showed off their figures while singing and dancing; some were less active but compensated by appearing in elaborate stage costumes.&lt;ref name=humez&gt;Humez, Nick.

Comics who appeared in burlesque early in their careers included [[Fanny Brice]], [[Mae West]], [[Eddie Cantor]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[W. C. Fields]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Bert Lahr]], [[Phil Silvers]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Red Skelton]] and [[Sophie Tucker]].&lt;ref name=humez/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3442">'''Christiania Offentlige Theater''' ('Christiania Public Theatre') or ''Det Strømbergske Teater'' ('Strömberg Theatre') was a historic theatre in [[Oslo]] in Norway, active between 1827 and 1835. It was the first public theatre in Oslo and in Norway, and the predecessor of the [[Christiania Theatre]].

The theater was founded by the Swedish theatre director [[Johan Peter Strömberg]]. With the exception of the unsuccessfull attempt of [[Martin Nürenbach]] in 1772, there was no public theatre in Oslo or anywhere in Norway prior to 1827. Theatre was performed by foreign travelling theatre companies, or privately by ''[[Det Dramatiske Selskab]]''.

Strömberg wished to establish a professional public theatre in Norway, with professional native actors. He obtained a theater permit from the Danish crown, and founded the first dramatic school in 1825 in order to train the first group of native actors.

In 30 January 1827, the theatre was inaugurated with a performance of Strömberg's students, the pioneer group of Norwegian actors. However, the Norwegian actors was not considered trained enough to meet the standars of the audience, and Strömberg was forced to engage trained actors from Denmark.  On 4 November 1827, Strömberg performed his play ''Fredsfesten'' in praise of the unpopular [[Swedish-Norwegian Union]], which attracted great criticism.  In the spring of 1828, Strömberg was declared bancrupt, rented the theatre and the theatre permit to one of his Danish actors, [[Jens Lang Bøcher]], and returned to Sweden. Jens Lang Bøcher replaced almost all of the Norwegian staff with Danes, allowing only five Norwegians to remain.  On 22 June 1832, Strömberg sold the theatre to the director [[Carl Anton Saabye]], after which it was renamed to Christiania Offentlige Theater.

The first opera performed in public in Norway, ''Deux mots'' by [[Nicolas Dalayrac]], was performed here in 1831, directed by [[August Schrumpf]] with [[Augusta Smith]] in the main role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Europas konstnärer|title=Schrumpf|url=http://runeberg.org/eurkonst/0532.html|publisher=Runeberg.org|accessdate=23 August 2011|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre burned down on 5 November 1835, after which the theater company performed in the house of the ''Det Dramatiske Selskab'' until the [[Christiania Theatre]] was inaugurated on 4 October 1837.

Changes to the [[List of countries by motor vehicle production|dynamics of the automotive industry]] left the State of Michigan with vacant factories and commercial buildings, these buildings were well suited to be repurposed as [[sound stage]]s and [[Filmmaking|film production]] facilities.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; In 2008, Michigan offered nationally competitive [[Movie production incentives in the United States|film incentives]] that coincided with the [[Effects of the 2008–2010 automotive industry crisis on the United States|automotive industry crisis]].&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; The Michigan Film Incentive effort was successful in creating a film production infrastructure and workforce, however the film incentive was scaled back and capped at $25 million per year by incoming [[Rick Snyder|Governor, Rick Snyder]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=CNNincentive/&gt;  Negotiations between industry and the legislature resulted in a $50 million budget for the film incentive in 2012.&lt;ref name=50million/&gt; The Governor's Recommendation for FY 2013-14, caps the film incentive budget at $25 million.&lt;ref name="FY 2013-14"/&gt;

Studio benefactors of the Michigan Film Incentive included: Raleigh Michigan Studios (Now known as [[Michigan Motion Picture Studios]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]),&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="motown"/&gt; Detroit Center Studios/Wonderstruck (in [[Detroit]]),&lt;ref name="mgm"/&gt; [[10 West Studios]] (in [[Manistee, Michigan|Manistee]]) and now defunct Unity Studios ([[Allen Park, Michigan|Allen Park]]).&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ReelChicago/&gt;

== The Michigan Film Office ==
The Michigan Film Office is overseen by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and is a benefactor of the Michigan Strategic Fund.&lt;ref name="Strategic fund"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strategic Fund Audit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MFODuties/&gt; Formerly, an office consisting of one employee, under the umbrella of the History, Arts, and Libraries, staffing levels grew to six employees after film incentives were introduced in 2008.&lt;ref name="MFO Interview"/&gt; Michelle Begnoche, Public Relations Manager of the Michigan Film Office explains the goal of the film incentive:  "The goal of the incentive is not to incentivize the movies that will make the most money; the goal of the film incentive is to incent those movies who will spend the most money in Michigan. So we are not looking at whether or not they get their money back. We are looking at how much are they going to spend on Michigan workers making that movie and how much are they going to spend in Michigan hotels and in the local areas while making that movie." &lt;ref name="MFO Interview"/&gt;

:"The Michigan Film Office was created in 1979 to assist and attract incoming production companies and to promote the growth of our indigenous industry. It provides several services, such as location photographs; help with location procurement and clearance; liaison with local/county/state government; contacts with business, institutions, neighborhoods, and other groups; production information, and location assistance."
:: '''— Michigan Economic Development Corporation''' &lt;ref name="MFO defined"/&gt;

An organization known as the Michigan Production Alliance was formed as a 501c6 trade group in order to assist film community members with information, education and legislation with regard to the production industry in Michigan. The organization sent representatives to each legislative and non political meeting as the initial film incentives were being developed and assisted in helping both legislators and the general population understand why incentives are like economic development driving diversification for the state's economy.

=== The Michigan Film and Digital Media Incentive ===

The Michigan Film and Digital Media Incentive was signed into law on April 7, 2008, by Governor [[Jennifer M. Granholm]]([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]). The legislation included Public Acts 74 through 87 of 2008.&lt;ref name=MichiganLeg/&gt;&lt;ref name=LegAnal/&gt;  Introduced for the purpose of [[Workforce development|workforce]] and [[Infrastructure#Impact on economic development|infrastructure development]], a refundable or transferable tax incentive focuses on film, television and digital media production in the state of Michigan.  The pre-2012 enactment of the film incentive, included a 40-percent subsidy for covered personnel expenditures, with an additional two-percent available for projects produced in Michigan's 103 core communities. Above the line personnel, directors, writers, producers etc., were eligible for a 40% credit on salaries regardless of Michigan residency.  Below the line personnel, film industry craftsmen, technicians and engineers received a 40% credit if they were Michigan residents, or 30% for nonresidents.&lt;ref name="Above the line"/&gt;  Capped at $20 million annually,&lt;ref name=LegAnal/&gt;{{rp|5}} the construction industry also benefited with a 25-percent subsidy for capital improvements, on the creation of new film-industry related facilities. The workforce development incentive also provided a Film and Digital Media Job Training Tax Credit, of 50-percent, for on the job training expenses of Michigan residents.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2008"/&gt;

Of the 35 states that provide film industry incentives, 13 were considered competitive in 2008, Michigan became one of the top 3 competitors with [[New Mexico]] and [[Louisiana]] in this group. In 2008, Michigan film industry expenditures grossed $125 million, up from $2 million in 2007, creating an estimated 2800 jobs with incentive outlays of $47,992,000.00.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2008"/&gt;

==== Film industry statistics ====
The 2007 Census reports that Michigan's participation in the [[North American Industry Classification System|North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)]] group, 512110 Motion picture and video production, had 923 employees participating in total salaries of $38.5 million annually ($41,767.00 average); the national employment pool, consisted of 142,620 employees, and generated salaries of $11.9 billion ($83,438.50 average) in the same year. Total industry revenues for, NAICS 512110 Motion picture and video production, was valued at $59.9 billion in 2007.&lt;ref name=Census/&gt;  It must be kept in mind however that freelance or Seasonal employees who make up the film industry workforce are NOT counted in the NAICS audits because they do not work for a specific company and often work for several during a given year. This makes it hard to quantify the film industry labor force.

==== Four-year Overview ====

:Since the incentives took effect in 2008, the Film Office and the Department of Treasury have approved a total of $392,384,844 in film incentives on $1,003,835,842 in total qualified expenditures by productions in Michigan. This represents 229 projects that have been approved to date, including 164 projects that have actually wrapped the state.

==== Public Act 291 of 2011 ====

In March 2011, [[Rick Snyder#Governor of Michigan|Governor Rick Snyder]]([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]) announced plans to put a $25 million cap on the [[Michigan Film Incentive]], which at 42%, was one of the most aggressive film incentives in the United States. [[CNN]] reported that agreements signed prior to the cap proposal would be honored and that there were 43 pending applications on file at the [[Michigan Film Office]]. [[John E. Nixon]], [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] and [[Michigan Department of Technology, Management, and Budget]] claimed that the Governor was not opposed to efforts to attract the film industry, but was concerned about uncapped and unfunded expenditures. "Nixon says that every dollar spent brings in only 28 cents, not enough to justify such a high tax incentive."&lt;ref name=CNNincentive/&gt;

Public Act 291 of 2011 (Section 125.2029h), was signed into Michigan law, effective immediately, on December 21, 2011.&lt;ref name=IncentiveReduced/&gt;  The new law honored existing production approvals with the following conditions stated in the Michigan Film Office 2011 Annual Report. Pre-production must begin within 90 days of approval, projects must have a signed agreement to participate and funds spent prior to obtaining a signed agreement do not qualify; additionally, budget increases must be approved by the Film Office and the Treasury to qualify for the incentive.  An audit with an independent Michigan CPA is required to obtain a post-production certificate, which is then submitted with the production's Michigan Business Tax return.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt; Eligible projects are motion pictures, documentaries, television series, miniseries, interactive television, music videos, interactive games, video games, Internet programming, sound recording, ditital animation and interactive websites. Criteria for incentive approval are listed as follows:&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt;

# The production is financially viable.
# Utilization of existing infrastructure (studios, post-production facilities, equipment rental, etc.).
# The number and wage levels of direct jobs for Michigan residents created by a production.
# Ability to show Michigan in a positive light and promote the state as a tourist destination.
# Magnitude of estimated expenditures in Michigan.

Act 291 did not provide separate funding for infrastructure and workforce development for 2012 and no business tax credits were claimed in these categories for 2011; in the Michigan Film Office 2011 report, the Office was unclear on any discretion regarding funding infrastructure and workforce development expenditures within the $25 million annual cap.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt; paragraph 3, of Section 125.2029h, does not mention infrastructure and workforce development.&lt;ref name="MICHIGAN STRATEGIC FUND ACT"/&gt;

Section 125.2029h (13) The film and digital media production assistance program shall provide for all of the following:
::(a) Funding shall be provided only to reimburse direct production expenditures, Michigan personnel expenditures, crew personnel expenditures, or qualified personnel expenditures.

::(b) To be eligible to apply for funding, the eligible production company shall have direct production expenditures, Michigan personnel expenditures, or a combination of direct production expenditures and Michigan personnel expenditures, of $100,000.00 or more.

Act 291 also specifically disqualifies commercials, televised news, weather reports, financial reports, political and fund-raising events, employee training and productions containing obscene matter from the incentive.&lt;ref name="MICHIGAN STRATEGIC FUND ACT"/&gt;

Negotiations with the legislature provided $50 million for the film incentive in 2012.&lt;ref name=50million/&gt; The Governor's Recommendation for FY 2013-14 (S.B. 194), reduces the film incentive from $50 million to $25 million.&lt;ref name="FY 2013-14"/&gt;

===== Results of reduction in funding =====

In March 2011, the Michigan Film Office reported to [[CNNMoney.com]] that 43 pending applications could not be addressed until the legislature reached a final decision. Michigan Movie Magazine's, Chris Aliapoulios said, "As these applications sit in limbo, the projects involved are seeking out new locations..." &lt;ref name=CNNincentive/&gt;

In its 2011 publication, the Michigan Film Office reported that 24 of 85 project applications were approved, 15 of those projects wrapped in 2011, 2 remained in production and 7 were in pre-production and scheduled to shoot in 2012. Eight additional projects that began in 2010, 2011 expenditures for these projects are included in the 2011 report.  Twenty-five projects spent an estimated $201,968,238 in Michigan and were awarded $75,650,154.  These productions created 3350 jobs, or an equivalent of 766 full-time employment.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt;

==== Film incentive controversy ====

Opposed to the Michigan Film Incentive was the Center for Public Policy, which claimed that employment growth was too modest for the amount of money the state was spending.&lt;ref name=Huffpo/&gt; Governor Snyder has stated, "One of the problems with the tax credit world is that you're picking winners and losers, and government is not really competent to do that." &lt;ref name="Winners and Losers"/&gt;

Proponents of the film incentive, cited a multiplier effect,&lt;ref name=Zin/&gt; whereby the simple act of money changing hands creates excise tax income, investment and consumer optimism.  A commissioned report, authored by [[Ernst &amp; Young]], found that 2,631 film industry jobs had been created in 2009 and 3,860 jobs in 2010. Ernst &amp; Young also found that economic activity was increased 6 to 1 for every incentive dollar spent.&lt;ref name=CNNincentive/&gt;

Economist David Zin, states that the film incentives have had a positive impact on the private sector, but also interjects that five years of employment growth, projected by [[Michigan State University]], would only replace 8.1% of the jobs lost in Michigan between May and June 2008.&lt;ref name=Zin/&gt; David Zin, closes his 34-page issue paper on film incentives with, "As with other types of incentives and credits, whether the relationship of costs to benefits is acceptable is a decision for individual policy-makers." &lt;ref name=Zin/&gt;

Alexander Martin, an economist, writes to the State of Michigan House Tax Policy Committee Chair, Judson S. Gilbert II, warning the committee of a "[[race to the bottom]]" economic condition, concerning subsidies that are geared toward increasing market share. Martin describes a scenario where the film industry may induce states with film incentives to bid against each other for film production business. Additionally, individuals, corporations and municipalities may make investments in an industry that can disappear when another State raises their film incentive. As proof, he offer the situation where [[Allen Park, Michigan|Allen Park]] was contemplating laying off its fire department largely because Unity Studios relocated to Detroit.&lt;ref name="Martin Testimony"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire Layoffs"/&gt;

'''''Forbidden Voices''''' is a [[documentary film]] by director Barbara Miller about the fight for [[Human Rights]] and [[Freedom of Speech]] of three female bloggers: [[Yoani Sánchez]] from [[Cuba]], [[Zeng Jinyan]] from [[China]] and Farnaz Seifi from [[Iran]].

The film ''Forbidden Voices'' explores the motivation and goals of the online activists’ struggle and traces the consequences and [[political repression]]s the three women are facing for their courageous activism. The documentary won the [[Amnesty International]] Award 2013 and the WACC SIGNIS Human Rights Award 2012, and was nominated for the [[Swiss Film Award]] and the Prix de Soleure in 2013.

== The Film: Internet censorship and repression ==
''Forbidden Voices'' describes how [[Internet in Cuba|Internet access in Cuba]] is still prohibited for the average citizen, and [[Internet censorship in China]] and [[Internet censorship in Iran|Internet access in Iran]] are very harsh, the blogs of the three [[protagonists]] are [[censored]], [[Block (Internet)|blocked]] or even shut-down by their governments. Seen by their governments as [[dissidents]] the bloggers are often under [[surveillance]] and facing harsh [[Political repression|repression]]s. Yoani Sánchez has been [[beaten]] and [[arrested]], as well as [[defamed|publicly defamed]] on [[Cuban Institute of Radio and Television|Cuban State TV]] for fighting for Human Rights in Cuba;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/08/us-cuba-blogger-idUSTRE7175YG20110208 | title = Cuba unblocks access to controversial blog |agency=Reuters | accessdate =February 10, 2011 | date=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.kaosenlared.net/noticia/entrevista-manuel-david-orrio-rosario-agente-miguel-seguridad-estado-c | title = Kaos en la red (Chaos on the Web): Interview with State Security Agent Miguel |publisher=Kaos en la Red| language = Spanish | accessdate =March 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.postwritersgroup.com/archives/varg080402.htm | title = Washington Post: Cuban Courage |work=Washington Post| accessdate =March 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/2008/06/23/nacional/artic01.html |date=* |title=Granma: Prólogo&amp;nbsp;— Fidel, Bolivia y algo más... }} {{es icon}} Retrieved October 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zeng Jinyan lived for years with her husband [[Hu Jia (activist)|Hu Jia (Activist)]] and her new born daughter under [[house arrest]] in [[Beijing]] for their fight for [[Human Rights in China]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/05/21/china15979.htm/ "Activist Couple Accoused of Endangering State Security", Human Rights Watch, May 21, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0,28804,1595326_1615754_1616169,00.html/ "Zeng Jinyan - The TIME 100," TIME Magazine, May 14, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/09/asia/AS-China-Human-Rights.php "Chinese rights activist Zeng Jinyan disappears" International Herald Tribune, August 9, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and Farnaz Seifi has been arrested for her fight for [[Gender Equality]] in Iran and forced in to [[exile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://globaljournalist.jour.missouri.edu/stories/2013/11/18/female-bloggers-fight-for-freedom-of-speech/ "Female-Bloggers-Fight-For-Freedom-of-Speech, Nov 18,2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/popups/pdf/5313313/key-note-von-der-journalistin-farnaz-seifi-internet-und-iranpdf.pdf/"Key Note von Farnaz Seifi: The local blogosphere and the conflict in Iran , Apr. 15, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.ch/fr/pays/moyen-orient-afrique-du-nord/iran/docs/2012/farnaz-seifi-blogueuse-en-exil/"Farnaz seifi, Exiled Blogger," 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews ==
* "''Forbidden Voice''s is a compelling and deeply disturbing documentary that makes those of us who freely sit at our laptops and type realize how much we take for granted, and how powerful these women’s voices are in their repressive societies." (Review by Leah Kolb, Bitch Flicks)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btchflcks.com/2013/08/documentary-explores-the-forbidden-voices-of-three-female-bloggers.html#.UmFRBijvM6I |title=Review Bitch Flicks }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "This is a humbling documentary for a reporter to watch. Following three bloggers whose beat is their government’s oppression, we see the extreme lengths they go to tell the world their stories: They bear house arrest, get beaten up by police, live for years in exile…. Yet despite the misery these women’s governments put them through, ''Forbidden Voices'' is hopeful: Information can no longer be managed by the state. That’s largely because of technology, but equally due to the spirit of women like Sanchez, Farnaz, and Zeng." (Review ''Forbidden Voices'', by Daniel Person, [[Seattle Weekly]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/home/946910-129/siff-miller-brian-film-cinema-uptown |title=Review Seattle Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The film opens with blood-curdling screams of Yoani Sánchez. The Cuban blogger fought in February 2010 against an ambush-style arrest by the secret police, and the courageous woman was able to achieve in that critical moment the impossible, namely to operate unnoticed the recording button on her mobile phone. The ugly face of the ubiquitous apparatus of repression in the realm of the Castro brothers who still enjoy in certain circles a residual prestige ("After all, Cuba has a free health and education system for all"), could hardly be shown more impressively then as with this dramatic opening sequence." (Review ''Forbidden Voices'', by Geri Krebs, [[NZZ]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/startseite/langer-weg-mit-drei-mutigen-frauen_1.16801107.html |title=Review Geri Krebs from NZZ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}

'''Forgery''' is a [[white-collar crime]] that generally refers to the false making or material alteration of a [[legal instrument]] with the specific [[mens rea|intent]] to [[wikt:defraud#English|defraud]] anyone (other than himself or herself).&lt;ref name="United States"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tooby"/&gt; Copies, studio replicas, and reproductions are not considered forgeries, though they may later become forgeries through knowing and willful [[misrepresentation]]s. Forging [[money]] or [[currency]] is more often called [[counterfeit]]ing. But [[consumer good]]s may also be ''counterfeits'' if they are not manufactured or produced by the designated manufacturer or producer given on the [[label]] or flagged by the [[trademark]] symbol. When the object forged is a record or document it is often called a [[false document]].

This usage of "forgery" does not derive from [[Metalworking|metalwork]] done at a forge, but it has a parallel history. A sense of "to [[counterfeit]]" is already in the Anglo-French verb ''forger'', meaning "falsify".

A forgery is essentially concerned with a produced or altered object. Where the prime concern of a forgery is less focused on the object itself &amp;ndash; what it is worth or what it "proves" &amp;ndash; than on a tacit statement of criticism that is revealed by the reactions the object provokes in others, then the larger process is a [[hoax]]. In a hoax, a [[rumor]] or a genuine object planted in a concocted situation, may substitute for a forged physical object.

The similar crime of [[fraud]] is the crime of deceiving another, including through the use of objects obtained through forgery. Forgery is one of the techniques of fraud, including [[identity theft]]. Forgery is one of the threats addressed by [[security engineering]].

In the 16th century, imitators of [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s style of printmaking improved the market for their own prints by [[signature forgery|signing]] them "AD", making them forgeries. In the 20th century the art market made forgeries highly profitable. There are widespread forgeries of especially valued artists, such as drawings originally by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Henri Matisse]].

A special case of double forgery is the forging of [[Vermeer]]'s paintings by [[Han van Meegeren]], and in its turn the forging of Van Meegeren's work by his son [[Jacques van Meegeren]].

==Criminal law==
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}

===England and Wales and Northern Ireland===
In [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], forgery is an offence under section 1 of the [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]], which provides:

{{Blockquote|A person is guilty of forgery if he makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or another shall use it to induce somebody to accept it as genuine, and by reason of so accepting it to do or not to do some act to his own or any other person’s prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Legislation.gov.uk]]. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/section/1 Digitised copy of section 1].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Instrument" is defined by section 8, "makes" and "false" by section 9, and "induce" and "prejudice" by section 10.

Forgery is [[triable either way]]. A person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on [[indictment]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or, on [[summary conviction]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[statutory maximum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/section/6 sections 6(1) to (3)(a)]&lt;/ref&gt;

For offences akin to forgery, see [[English criminal law#Forgery, personation, and cheating]].

The [[common law offence]] of forgery is abolished for all purposes not relating to offences committed before the commencement of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.&lt;ref&gt;The Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/section/13 section 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
Forgery is not an official offence under the law of Scotland, except in cases where statute provides otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;W J Stewart and Robert Burgess. Collins Dictionary of Law. HarperCollins Publishers. 1996. {{ISBN|0 00 470009 0}}. Pages 176 and 398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], forgery is an offence under section 25(1) of the [[Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001]] which provides:

{{Blockquote|A person is guilty of forgery if he or she makes a false instrument with the intention that it shall be used to induce another person to accept it as genuine and, by reason of so accepting it, to do some act, or to make some omission, to the prejudice of that person or any other person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irish Statute Book]]. [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0025.html Digitised copy of section 25].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or to a fine, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001]], section 25(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Any offence at common law of forgery is abolished. The abolition of a common law offence of forgery does not affect proceedings for any such offence committed before its abolition.&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0003.html sections 3(2) and (3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Except as regards offences committed before the commencement of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 and except where the context otherwise requires, without prejudice to section 65(4)(a) of that Act, references to forgery must be construed in accordance with the provisions of that Act.&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0065.html section 65(4)(b)]&lt;/ref&gt;

*if tried [[Summary offence#Canada|summarily]]: 6 months
*if tried [[:wikibooks:Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Forgery|on indictment]]: 10 years

===United States===
{{Further|Crimes Act of 1790}}
Forgery is a crime in all jurisdictions within the [[United States]], both state and federal.&lt;ref name="United States"&gt;''United States v. Hunt'', [https://casetext.com/case/us-v-hunt-74#p1260 456 F.3d 1255], 1260 ([[10th Cir.]] 2006) ("Historically, forgery was defined as the false making, '''with the intent to defraud''', of a [[legal instrument|document]] which is not what it purports to be, as distinct from a document which is genuine but nevertheless contains a term or representation known to be false.") (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added); see generally, {{USC|10|923}} ("Forgery"); {{USC|18|470|514}} (counterfeiting and forgery-related federal offenses); {{USC|18|1543}} ("Forgery or false use of passport").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tooby"&gt;{{cite web |title=§ 19.71 S.

==Civil law==
As to the effect, in the United Kingdom, of a forged signature on a bill of exchange, see section 24 of the [[Bills of Exchange Act 1882]].

==Documentary art==
Before the invention of [[photography]], people commonly hired painters and engravers to "re-create" an event or a scene. Artists had to imagine what to illustrate based on the information available to them about the subject. Some artists added elements to make the scene more exotic, while others removed elements out of modesty. In the 18th century, for example, Europeans were curious about what North America looked like and were ready to pay to see illustrations depicting this faraway place. Some of these artists produced prints depicting North America, despite many having never left Europe.

==In popular culture==
*The 1839 novel by [[Honoré de Balzac]], ''[[Pierre Grassou]]'', concerns an artist who lives off forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Ruth Yeazell|last=Yeazell |first=Ruth Bernard |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka4Ox67dy_cC&amp;pg=PA88 |title=Art of the Everyday: Dutch Painting and the Realist Novel |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=88 |isbn=0691127263}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Orson Welles]] documentary ''[[F for Fake]]'' concerns both art and literary forgery. For the movie, Welles intercut footage of [[Elmyr de Hory]], an art forger, and [[Clifford Irving]], who wrote an "authorized" autobiography of [[Howard Hughes]] that had been revealed to be a [[hoax]]. While forgery is the ostensible subject of the film, it also concerns art, film making, storytelling and the creative process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McBride |first=Joseph |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFp8S8Tf-dQC&amp;pg=PA245 |title=What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?: A Portrait of an Independent Career |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |pages=245–250 |isbn=0813124107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The 1972 novel by [[Irving Wallace]], ''[[The Word (novel)|The Word]]'' concerns archaeological forgery, the finding and translation of a supposed lost [[gospel]] by [[James the Just]], close relative of [[Jesus Christ]], as part of a large project to be published as a new Bible that would inspire a Christian revival, but which is possibly a forged document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawelti |first=John G. |year=1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LiRHxXOHYEC&amp;pg=PA281 |title=Adventure, Mystery, and Romance: Formula Stories as Art and Popular Culture |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=281 |isbn=0226098672}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 2002 film ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], is based on the real story of [[Frank Abagnale]], a [[confidence trick|con man]] who stole over $2.5 million through forgery, imposture and other frauds, which are dramatized in the film.

The '''Farina Fragrance Museum''' is situated across from [[Cologne City Hall]], and near the famous [[Wallraf-Richartz-Museum]] in the Obenmarspforten in [[Innenstadt, Cologne]]. Founded in 1709, [[Farina gegenüber|John Maria Farina opposite the Jülichs Place]] is the eldest fragrance factory still standing and houses the registered office since 1723.

Over several floors, the museum provides a very detailed insight into the production methods of perfume throughout the various stages. The focus is primarily laid on [[Eau de Cologne]], and one will therefore discover some particular technical devices such as [[distillation apparatus]] which were once used. In addition to the equipment, one will also be able to witness the evolution thanks to various pictures and documents which help trace back history. Moreover, as copyright didn’t exist in those days, a great deal of imitations and forgeries of Eau de Cologne rapidly appeared on the market and a certain number of them are also presented in the museum. Further details as to the changes in the manufacturing of Farina Eau de Cologne are also on display.

On 25 November 2006, in commemoration of John Maria Farina’s 240th death anniversary, the Farina House was elected “place to be” within the context of the project “Germany Land to be”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.land-der-ideen.de/CDA/ort_des_tages,1987,1,,de.html?action=detail&amp;id=508 Auszeichnung „Ort des Tages“ in der Wettbewerbsreihe ''Deutschland Land der Ideen'', auf land-der-ideen.de, accessed 13 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koeln.de/artikel/Koeln/Bundespraesident-ehrt-Koelns-Duftmuseum-32087-1.html Kölns Duftmuseum im Projekt des Bundespräsident geehrt, Presseartikel auf koeln.de, accessed 13 May 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120527003828/http://www.koeln.de/artikel/Koeln/Bundespraesident-ehrt-Koelns-Duftmuseum-32087-1.html |date=27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Girl with a Flute''''' is a small painting attributed to the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Johannes Vermeer]], executed 1665–1670. The work is in possession of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], just as ''[[Woman Holding a Balance]]'', ''[[A Lady Writing a Letter]]'' and ''[[Girl with a Red Hat]]'' (also attributed to Vermeer). 

== Description ==
It is contested whether the painting can be attributed to Johannes Vermeer. Possibly another painter finished the painting after an initial start by Vermeer.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, page 135&lt;/ref&gt; The composition is comparable to ''Girl with a Red Hat'', the only other work Vermeer painted on panel. The bluegreen jacket with the fur lining is also used in '' Woman Holding a Balance'' and ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' and is listed as a  'oude groene false mantel met een witte bonte kant' in Vermeer's inventory after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, page 194&lt;/ref&gt; Just like ''Girl with a Red Hat'' and ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' the model wears a glass, lacquered pearl earring. 

''Girl with a Flute '' is a so-called ''[[tronie]]'', a study of a remarkable [[facial expression]] or a [[stock character]] in costume. This was a popular genre in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]. ''Tronies'' were produced for the mass market, not for specific patrons. Unlike with [[portrait]]s the models were always anonymous. 

== Owners ==
[[File:Vermeer - Girl with a Red Hat.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Girl with a Red Hat]]'']]
''Girl with a Flute'' was in possession of the family of [[Pieter van Ruijven]] and was sold at the 1696 Dissius auction in [[Amsterdam]]. The work was probably one of the three ''tronies'' with catalogue numbers 38, 39 and 40.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/clients_patrons/dissius_auction.html Dissius auction]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 19th century the painting was owned by the Van Son family in Brabant. In 1923 the American [[art collector]] [[Joseph E. Widener]] bought the painting. Widener donated his extensive and valuable art collection in 1939 to the National Gallery of Art, including this Vermeer painting.

{{Saadi Shirazi}}
[[File:Sadi in a Rose garden.jpg|thumb|Saadi in a Rose garden, from a [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] manuscript of the Gulistan, ca. 1645.]]
The '''''Gulistan''''' ({{lang-fa|گلستان}}, also transliterated as ''Golestan''&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; "The Rose Garden") is a landmark of [[Persian literature]], perhaps its single most influential work of prose.&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Franklin |title=GOLESTĀN-E SAʿDI|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/golestan-e-sadi|work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|accessdate=16 January 2011|date=15 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 1258 [[Common Era|CE]], it is one of two major works of the Persian poet [[Saadi Shirazi|Sa'di]], considered one of the greatest medieval Persian   poets.  It is also one of his most popular books, and has proved deeply influential in the West as well as the East.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/virtualtour/gulistan.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulistan is a collection of poems and stories, just as a rose-garden is a collection of roses.  It is widely quoted as a source of wisdom. The well-known aphorism still frequently repeated in the western world, about being sad because one has no shoes until one meets the man who has no feet "whereupon I thanked Providence for its bounty to myself" is from the Gulistan.&lt;ref&gt;[Durant, The Age of Faith, 326]&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimalist plots of the Gulistan's stories are expressed with precise language and psychological insight, creating a "poetry of ideas" with the concision of mathematical formulas.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; The book explores virtually every major issue faced by humankind, with both an optimistic and a subtly satirical tone.&lt;ref name=katouzian&gt;{{cite book|last=Katouzian|first=Homa|title=Sa‘di, The Poet of Life, Love and Compassion|year=2006|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-85168-473-1|url=http://sufibooks.info/Sufism/Sadi-The-Poet-of-Life-Love-and-Compassion-Homa-Katouzian.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is much advice for rulers, in this way coming within the [[mirror for princes]] genre. But as Eastwick comments in his introduction to the work,&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;https://archive.org/stream/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; there is a common saying in Persian, "Each word of Sa'di has seventy-two meanings", and the stories, alongside their entertainment value and practical and moral dimension, frequently focus on the conduct of [[dervishes]] and are said to contain [[sufi]] teachings.

In his introduction Sa'di describes how a friend persuaded him to go out to a garden on 21&amp;nbsp;April 1258. There the friend gathered up flowers to take back to town. Sa'di remarked on how quickly the flowers would die, and proposed a flower garden that would last much longer:

:::''Of what use will be a dish of roses to thee?''
:::''Take a leaf from my rose-garden.''
:::''A flower endures but five or six days''
:::''But this rose-garden is always delightful.''

Sa'di continues, "On the same day I happened to write two chapters, namely on polite society and the rules of conversation, in a style acceptable to orators and instructive to letter-writers.".&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/gulistan.txt&lt;/ref&gt; In finishing the book, Sa'di writes that, though his speech is entertaining and amusing, "it is not hidden from the enlightened minds of ''sahibdils'' (possessors of heart), who are primarily addressed here, that pearls of healing counsel have been drawn onto strings of expression, and the bitter medicine of advice has been mixed with the honey of wit".&lt;ref name=thackston&gt;{{cite book|last=Thackston|first=Shaykh Mushrifuddin Sa'di of Shiraz ; new English translation by Wheeler M.|title=The Gulistan, rose garden of Sa'di: Bilingual English and Persian edition with vocabulary|year=2008|publisher=Ibex Publishers|location=Bethesda, Md.|isbn=978-1-58814-058-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

After the introduction, the Gulistan is divided into eight chapters, each consisting of a number of stories and poetry:&lt;ref&gt;Chapter titles given in the 1899 translation by Sir Edwin Arnold, http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/gulistan.txt&lt;/ref&gt;
:1. The Manners of Kings

Some stories are very brief. They are accompanied by short verses sometimes representing the words of the protagonists, sometimes representing the author's  perspective and sometimes, as in the following case, not clearly attributed:

===Chapter 1, story 34===
One of the sons of Harunu'r-rashid came to his father in a passion, saying, "Such an officer's son has insulted me, by speaking abusively of my mother." Harun said to his nobles, "What should be the punishment of such a person?" One gave his voice for death, and another for the excision of his tongue, and another for the confiscation of his goods and banishment. Harun said, "O my son! the generous part would be to pardon him, and if thou canst not, then do thou abuse his mother, but not so as to exceed the just limits of retaliation, for in that case we should become the aggressors."

:::''They that with raging elephants make war''
:::''Are not, so deem the wise, the truly brave;''
:::''But in real verity, the valiant are''
:::''Those who, when angered, are not passion's slave. ''

:::''An ill-bred fellow once a man reviled,''
:::''Who patient bore it, and replied, "Good friend!''
:::''Worse am I than by thee I could be styled,''
:::''And better know how often I offend."''&lt;ref name=Eastwick&gt;{{cite book|last=Edward B.|first=Eastwick|title=Sadi: The Rose Garden|year=1852|url=https://archive.org/stream/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The king referred to is [[Harun al-Rashid]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there is little biographical information about Sa'di outside of his writings, his short, apparently autobiographical tales, such as the following have been used by commentators to build up an account of his life.

===Chapter 2, story 7===
I remember that, in the time of my childhood, I was devout, and in the habit of keeping vigils, and eager to practise mortification and austerities. One night I sate up in attendance on my father, and did not close my eyes the whole night, and held the precious qur'an in my lap while the people around me slept. I said to my father, "Not one of these lifts up his head to perform a prayer. They are so profoundly asleep that you would say they were dead." He replied, "Life of thy father! it were better if thou, too, wert asleep; rather than thou shouldst be backbiting people."

:::''Naught but themselves can vain pretenders mark,''
:::''For conceit's curtain intercepts their view.''
:::''Did God illume that which in them is dark,''
:::''Naught than themselves would wear a darker hue.''&lt;ref name=Eastwick /&gt;

Most of the tales within the Gulistan are longer, some running on for a number of pages. In one of the longest, in Chapter 3, Sa'di explores aspects of undertaking a journey for which one is ill-equipped:

===Chapter 3, story 28===
An athlete, down on his luck at home, tells his father how he believes he should set off on his travels, quoting the words:

:::'''As long as thou walkest about the shop or the house''
:::''Thou wilt never become a man, O raw fellow.''
:::''Go and travel in the world''
:::''Before that day when thou goest from the world.'''

His father warns him that his physical strength alone will not be sufficient to ensure the success of his travels, describing five kinds of men who can profit from travel: the rich merchant, the eloquent scholar, the beautiful person, the sweet singer and the artisan. The son nevertheless sets off and, arriving penniless at a broad river, tries to get a crossing on a ferry by using physical force. He gets aboard, but is left stranded on a pillar in the middle of the river. This is the first of a series of misfortunes that he is subjected to, and it is only the charity of a wealthy man that finally delivers him, allowing him to return home safe, though not much humbled by his tribulations. The story ends with the father warning him that if he tries it again he may not escape so luckily:

:::'''The hunter does not catch every time a jackal.''
:::''It may happen that some day a tiger devours him.'''

===Chapter 5, story 5===
In the fifth chapter of The Gulistan of Saadi, on Love and Youth, Saadi includes explicit moral and sociological points about the real life of people from his time period (1203-1291). One story about a schoolboy sheds light on the issues of sexual abuse and pedophilia, problems that have plagued all cultures. This story by Saadi, like so much of his work, conveys meaning on many levels and broadly on many topics. In this story, Saadi communicates the importance of teachers educating the “whole child”—cognitively, morally, emotionally, socially, and ethically. Even though adults and teachers have been accorded great status and respect in Iranian culture and history, in Saadi’s story, he shows that a young boy has great wisdom in understanding his educational needs.

:::''A schoolboy was so perfectly beautiful and sweet-voiced that the teacher, in accordance with human nature, conceived such an affection towards him that he often recited the following verses:''

:::::''I am not so little occupied with you, O heavenly face,''

:::::''That remembrance of myself occurs to my mind.''

:::::''From your sight I am unable to withdraw my eyes''

:::::''Although when I am opposite I may see that an arrow comes.''

:::''Once the boy said to him: “As you strive to direct my studies, direct also my behavior. If you perceive anything reprovable in my conduct, although it may seem approvable to me, inform me thereof that I may endeavor to change it.” He replied: “O boy, make that request to someone else because the eyes with which I look upon you behold nothing but virtues.”''

:::::''The ill-wishing eye, be it torn out''

:::::''Sees only defects in his virtue.''

:::::''But if you possess one virtue and seventy faults''

:::::''A friend sees nothing except that virtue.''&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/TheGulistanOrRoseGardenOfSadi-EdwardRehatsek&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Sa'di's Gulistan is said to be one of the most widely read books ever produced.&lt;ref name=thackston /&gt; From the time of its composition to the present day it has been admired for its "inimitable simplicity",&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; seen as the essence of simple elegant Persian prose. Persian for a long time was the language of literature from Bengal to Constantinople, and the Gulistan was known and studied in much of Asia. In Persian-speaking countries today, proverbs and aphorisms from the Gulistan appear in every kind of literature and continue to be current in conversation, much as [[Shakespeare]] is in English.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibex Publishers' description of Gulistan, http://ibexpub.com/index.php?main_page=pubs_product_book_info&amp;products_id=105&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Sir John Malcolm]] wrote in his ''Sketches of Persia'' in 1828, the stories and maxims of Sa'di were "known to all, from the king to the peasant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcom|first=John|title=Sketches of Persia|year=1828|pages=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeIvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe===
The Gulistan has been significant in the influence of [[Persian literature in Western culture|Persian literature on Western culture]]. [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]] based his "Le songe d'un habitant du Mogol"&lt;ref&gt;http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Songe_d%E2%80%99un_Habitant_du_Mogol&lt;/ref&gt; on a story from Gulistan chapter 2 story 16:
A certain pious man in a dream beheld a king in paradise and a devotee in hell. He inquired, "What is the reason of the exaltation of the one, and the cause of the degradation of the other? for I had imagined just the reverse." They said, "That king is now in paradise owing to his friendship for darweshes, and this recluse is in hell through frequenting the presence of kings."

:::''Of what avail is frock, or rosary,''
:::''Or clouted garment? Keep thyself but free''
:::''From evil deeds, it will not need for thee''
:::''To wear the cap of felt: a darwesh be''
:::''In heart, and wear the cap of Tartary.''&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

[[Voltaire]] was familiar with works of Sa'di, and wrote the preface of ''[[Zadig]]'' in his name. He mentions a French translation of the Gulistan, and himself translated a score of verses, either from the original or from some Latin or Dutch translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=William Raleigh|title=The symbolism of Voltaire's novels, with special reference to Zadig|year=1911|publisher=New York Columbia University Press|pages=79|url=https://archive.org/stream/symbolismofvolta00pricuoft/symbolismofvolta00pricuoft_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir William Jones]] advised students of Persian to pick an easy chapter of the Gulistan to translate as their first exercise in the language. Thus, selections of the book became the primer for officials of [[Company rule in India|British India]] at [[Fort William College]] and at [[East India Company College|Haileybury College]] in England.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

In the United States [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] who addressed a poem of his own to Sa'di, provided the preface for Gladwin's translation, writing, "Saadi exhibits perpetual variety of situation and incident&amp;nbsp;... he finds room on his narrow canvas for the extremes of lot, the play of motives, the rule of destiny, the lessons of morals, and the portraits of great men. He has furnished the originals of a multitude of tales and proverbs which are current in our mouths, and attributed by us to recent writers." [[Henry David Thoreau]] quoted from the book in ''[[A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers]]'' and in his remarks on philanthropy in ''[[Walden]]''.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

==Translations==
[[File:Gulistan du ryer.JPG|thumb|Frontispiece of André du Ryer's translation]]
Saʿdi was first introduced to the West in a partial French translation by [[André du Ryer]] (1634). Friedrich Ochsenbach based a German translation (1636) on this. Georgius Gentius produced a [[Latin]] version accompanied by the Persian text in 1651.&lt;ref&gt;''Iranian Studies in the Netherlands'', J. T. P. de Bruijn, '''Iranian Studies''', Vol. 20, No. 2/4, Iranian Studies in Europe and Japan (1987), 169.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Olearius]] made the first direct German translation.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

The Gulistan has been translated into many languages. It has been translated into English a number of times: Stephen Sullivan (London, 1774, selections), James Dumoulin (Calcutta, 1807), Francis Gladwin (Calcutta, 1808, preface by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015012849298&lt;/ref&gt; James Ross (London, 1823),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/sadi-gulistan2.html&lt;/ref&gt; S.

Hampton (New York, 1913), and [[Arthur John Arberry]] (London, 1945, the first two chapters).  More recent English translations have been published by [[Omar Ali-Shah]] (1997) and by [[Wheeler M. Thackston]] (2008).

The [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] poet and writer [[Gafur Gulom]] translated The Gulistan into the [[Uzbek language]].

==United Nations quotation==
This well-known verse, part of chapter 1, story 10 of the ''Gulistan'', is woven into a carpet which is hung on a wall in the [[United Nations]] building in New York:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/05/aug/1234.html Payvand News 24 August 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heroes World Distribution Co.''', originally named '''Superhero Enterprises''', was an [[United States|American]] [[comic book]] [[distributor]] founded by Ivan Snyder, active from 1975 to 1997, during the growth and consolidation of the [[direct market]]. Heroes World was acquired by [[Marvel Comics]] in late [[1994 in comics|1994]] to act as the publisher's sole distributor. This ill-fated move, combined with other marketplace factors of the time, resulted in the financial failure of many other comics distributors and retailers — and the near collapse of the entire North American comic book market.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In the early 1970s, Ivan Snyder was head of licensing in [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel Comics Group]]'s merchandising department, in charge of selling various Marvel licensed products via mail order. After a change in management in the mid-1970s, Marvel discontinued the mail order service, and  Snyder purchased the business in 1975, renaming it '''Superhero Enterprises'''. Initially running the business out his basement, Snyder shortly thereafter moved into a storefront in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], with a catalog showroom store format.  A second store was opened in a [[Livingston, New Jersey|Livingston]] shopping mall, with [[DC Comics]] products added to their product mix.&lt;ref name=mm /&gt;

When the former [[Mego Corporation]] trademark "Superhero" was purchased by Marvel and DC, Superheroes Enterprise was forced to change its name to '''Heroes World'''. By 1982, Heroes World's retail chain had expanded to 12 locations,&lt;ref name=mm&gt;{{cite web|last=Heiler|first=Brian|title=Visit Heroes World|url=http://www.megomuseum.com/megolibrary/articles/heroesworld.html|work=MegoLibrary|publisher=Mego Museum.com|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it continued its mail order distribution business. (The Heroes World catalog was produced in conjunction with the [[Dover, New Jersey]]-based [[Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art]].)&lt;ref name=mm /&gt;

=== Acquisition by Marvel ===
By late 1994, Heroes World was North America's third largest comics distributor&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;Gray, Bob. "Newswatch: Marvel Buys 3rd Largest Distributor: Heroes World Purchase Signals Fundamental Changes in the Direct Market," ''The Comics Journal'' #174 (Feb. 1995): pp. 15-22.&lt;/ref&gt; (behind [[Diamond Comics Distributors]] and [[Capital City Distribution]]). On December 28, 1994,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John Jackson. [http://www.comichron.com/comicstimeline/marveltimeline.html "Marvel Comics Timeline: Significant moments in the publishing history of Marvel Comics,"] The Comics Chronicles.&lt;/ref&gt; Heroes World was bought by Marvel Comics&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;Bryant, Adam. [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/24/business/pow-the-punches-that-left-marvel-reeling.html?_r=0 "BUSINESS DAY: Pow! The Punches That Left Marvel Reeling,"] ''New York Times'' (MAY 24, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; to act as the company's exclusive distributor,&lt;ref name="Gray" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DuinCC"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "Capital City" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; thus reducing other distributors' market share by more than a third.&lt;ref name="cbg129"&gt;Rozanski, Chuck. [http://www.milehighcomics.com/tales/cbg129.html "Marvel Comics to Self-Distribute  Heroes World,"] Tales From the Database, Mile High Comics (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The change took effect with books shipped July 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John Jackson (with additional reporting by T.M. Haley). [http://www.newsarama.com/comics/may-2010-comichron-report-100830.html "JULY '10 COMICHRON Report: 15 Years After HEROES WORLD,"] Newsarama (August 30, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; As industry veteran [[Chuck Rozanski]] notes:

{{quote|Without Marvel comics to distribute, all of the surviving direct market comics distributors suddenly found their overall sales volume reduced by 35%-40% ... while their operating costs remained constant. In a business where even a single point of discount or volume could translate into huge differences in earnings, these massive losses in sales volume were simply not sustainable. [[Steve Geppi]], owner of Diamond Comic Distributors, responded to this threat to the survival of his business by entering into negotiations to become the exclusive distributor for all the other comics publishers. ... While Steve was begging all the comics publishers to switch all of their distribution business exclusively over to his company, John Davis and [[Milton Griepp]] of Capital City were making the same pleas on the part of their organization.&lt;ref name="cbg129" /&gt;}}

The ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major North American distributor, Diamond.&lt;ref name="DuinCC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_July_26/ai_18526328 "Diamond Comic Distributors acquires Capital City Distribution; Comic distribution industry stabilized by purchase," bNet: Business Wire (July 26, 1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heroes World's new role as Marvel's exclusive distributor was a failure from the beginning. Lacking the infrastructure to handle Marvel's huge weekly orders resulted in extensive shipment and billing mistakes, errors which caused great consternation among the thousands of comics specialty shops affected.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Howard. "Blood &amp; Thunder: We Told You There's Be Days Like This," ''The Comics Journal'' #186 (Apr. 1996), pp 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Writes Rozanski:

{{quote|... the Heroes World management team failed miserably in the PR war to win the hearts and minds of comics retailers. In fact, rather than win over any converts to Marvel, the hassle of having to place two new comics orders each month (sometimes at a lower overall discount), plus paying freight costs on Heroes World shipments, pushed many comics retailers to the brink of closing their stores.&lt;ref name="cbg129" /&gt;}}

These factors, combined with the collapse of the comics speculation market, did indeed result in many comics stores closing their doors for good.

Throughout 1995 and 1996, Heroes World continued to flounder, facing lost business&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Wizards Cut Off Heroes World," ''The Comics Journal'' #179 (Aug. 1995), p. 25. (''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' cards no longer available through Heroes World.)&lt;/ref&gt; and lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, Jordan. "Son of Heroes World President Receives Fine, Probation for Tax Fraud," ''The Comics Journal'' #187 (May 1996), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"News Watch: Rojek's Suit Against Marvel Dismissed," ''The Comics Journal'' #189 (Aug. 1996), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1997 the company went out of business,&lt;ref name=Bryant /&gt; and Marvel returned to Diamond Distributors,&lt;ref&gt;"Hello Again: Marvel Goes with Diamond," ''The Comics Journal'' #193 (February 1997), pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; which by that point was the only major distributor left standing.

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Implementation''' is the realization of an application, or execution of a [[plan]], idea, [[scientific modelling|model]], [[design]], [[specification]], [[Standardization|standard]], [[algorithm]], or [[policy]].

==Industry-specific definitions==

===Computer science===
{{see|Software implementation (disambiguation)}}
In [[computer science]], an implementation is a realization of a [[technical specification]] or algorithm as a [[computer program|program]], [[software component]], or other [[computer system]] through [[computer programming]] and [[Software deployment|deployment]].  Many implementations may exist for a given specification or standard.  For example, [[web browser]]s contain implementations of [[World Wide Web Consortium]]-recommended specifications, and software development tools contain implementations of [[programming languages]].

A special case occurs in [[object-oriented programming]], when a [[concrete class|concrete]] [[class (object-oriented programming)|class]] implements an [[interface (object-oriented programming)|interface]]; in this case the concrete class is an ''implementation'' of the interface and it includes methods which are ''implementations'' of those [[method (object-oriented programming)|method]]s specified by the interface.

===Information technology===
{{AP|Information technology}}
In the [[information technology]] [[industry]], implementation refers to post-sales process of guiding a client from purchase to use of the software or hardware that was purchased. This includes requirements analysis, scope analysis, customizations, systems integrations, user policies, user training and delivery. These steps are often overseen by a project manager using [[project management]] methodologies. Software Implementations involve several professionals that are relatively new to the knowledge based economy such as [[Business analysis|business analysts]], [[Technical analysis|technical analysts]], [[solutions architect]]s, and project managers.

To implement a system successfully, a large number of inter-related tasks need to be carried out in an appropriate sequence. Utilising a well-proven implementation methodology and enlisting professional advice can help but often it is the number of tasks, poor planning and inadequate resourcing that causes problems with an implementation project, rather than any of the tasks being particularly difficult. Similarly with the cultural issues it is often the lack of adequate consultation and two-way communication that inhibits achievement of the desired results.

===Political science===
{{AP|Political science}}
In [[political science]], implementation refers to the carrying out of [[public policy]].  [[Legislatures]] pass laws that are then carried out by [[public servants]] working in [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic agencies]].  This process consists of rule-making, rule-administration and rule-adjudication.  Factors impacting implementation include the legislative intent, the administrative capacity of the implementing bureaucracy, interest group activity and opposition, and presidential or executive support.

In international relations, implementation refers to a stage of international treaty-making. It represents the stage when international provisions are enacted domestically through legislation and regulation. The implementation stage is different from the ratification of an international treaty.

===Social and health sciences===
Implementation is defined as a specified set of activities designed to put into practice an activity or program of known dimensions.  According to this definition, implementation processes are purposeful and are described in sufficient detail such that independent observers can detect the presence and strength of the "specific set of activities" related to implementation.  In addition, the activity or program being implemented is described in sufficient detail so that independent observers can detect its presence and strength."&lt;ref name="NIRN2014"&gt;The National Implementation Research Network&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water and natural resources===
In water and natural resources, implementation refers to the actualization of best management practices with the ultimate goals of conserving natural resources and improving the quality of water bodies.

====Types====
* [[Direct changeover]]
* [[Parallel running]], also known as parallel
* [[Phased implementation]]
* [[Pilot introduction]], also known as pilot
* [[Well-trade]]

==Role of end users==
System implementation generally benefits from high levels of user involvement and management support. User participation in the design and operation of information systems has several positive results. First, if users are heavily involved in systems design, they move opportunities to mold the system according to their priorities and business requirements, and more opportunities to control the outcome.  Second, they are more likely to react positively to the change process. Incorporating user knowledge and expertise leads to better solutions.

The relationship between users and information systems specialists has traditionally been a problem area for information systems implementation efforts.  Users and information systems specialists tend to have different backgrounds, interests, and priorities.  This is referred to as the user-designer communications gap.  These differences lead to divergent organizational loyalties, approaches to problem solving, and vocabularies.&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"/&gt; Examples of these differences or concerns are below:

===User concerns===
* Will the system deliver the information I need for my work?
* How quickly can I access the data?
* How easily can I retrieve the data?
* How much clerical support will I need to enter data into the system?
* How will the operation of the system fit into my daily business schedule?&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"&gt;Laudon, K., &amp; Laudon, J. (2010). "Management Information Systems: Managing the Digital Firm." Eleventh  Edition (11 ed.). New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designer concerns===
* How much disk storage space will the master file consume?
* How many lines of program code will it take to perform this function?
* How can we cut down on CPU time when we run the system?
* What are the most efficient ways of storing this data?
* What database management system should we use?&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"/&gt;

'''''Indianapolis Island''''' is a public artwork by American artist [[Andrea Zittel]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. The artwork consists of an inhabitable, white [[fiberglass]] structure that is mounted onto a [[floating dock (jetty)|floating dock]] system and installed in the 100 Acres lake. Each summer season it is occupied by resident(s) who can choose to modify the island's structure and interior design according to his or her own individual needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park|year=2010|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-936260-88-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The artwork is in the form of an organic, rounded pod structure that is approximately 20' in length and has a domed roof. The structure is made from [[Polystyrene#Expanded polystyrene|expanded polystyrene foam]], which is then coated with a [[fiberglass]]-[[resin]] matrix and a white [[Gelcoat]] mixture. After the Gelcoat cures, it functions as a protective shell for the initial foam layers as well as the interior living space. The artwork is complete with a wooden door, mounted with its own knob and lock hardware. The structure contains a circular front deck area where the fiberglass slopes at an angle, creating a built-in seating area. There is a [[rowboat]] that is brought out to the lake's shore seasonally to provide transportation to and from the island for the current resident(s) and his or her visitors.

The objects contained within the living space are in constant flux, in congruence with the transient nature of its inhabitants, who are seasonal, temporary residents of the island. ''Indianapolis Island'' is installed in 100 Acres' 35-acre lake. It is floated on a permanent dock structure that is anchored by two concrete blocks from the shoreline.

==Historical information==
Andrea Zittel, and her A-Z Enterprise, focuses on designing and fabricating artwork and installations that draw their inspiration from modern design aesthetics and functional living spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freudenheim|first=Susan|title='I Want to Create a World, and Live in It Completely'|url=http://zittel.artservr.com/texts/21.pdf|publisher=ArtNews|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zittel has been exploring the concept of creating habitable islands for years and her artwork, ''Indianapolis Island'', correlates with her ongoing theme of blurring the lines between life and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Art 21 on PBS|title=Andrea Zittel|url=https://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/zittel/|accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist anticipates the installation being used as a living space inhabited by temporary residents who will then modify the space according to their own individual needs. As a result, the island is capable of constantly morphing and evolving into a different space, both physically and conceptually. Andrea Zittel commented on the concept of ''Indianapolis Island'' in saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea of an island appeals to me as representation of many of the values that we strive for in our 21st-century culture: individualism, independence, autonomy, and self-sufficiency. Yet at the same time, these are the same desires that isolate us and lessen collective social and political power. I am fascinated at how the things that set us free are also the same things that oppress us; you could say that the concept of the deserted island is both our greatest fantasy and our greatest fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Art 21 Blog|title=The Island in 100 Acres: An Interview with Andrea Zittel|url=http://blog.art21.org/2010/01/21/the-island-in-100-acres-an-interview-with-andrea-zittel/|accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Island residency===
* ''Give and Take,'' 2010, Jessica Dunn and Michael Runge.
The residency completed by Dunn and Runge focused on the interaction and exchanges between island dweller and visitor. Their mission was to embrace the "give and take" nature of the artwork and reflect the concept of adaptation and evolution within their own personal experiences as well as their interaction with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=Nicole|author2=Richard McCoy|title=The Outdoor Sculptures of 100 Acres: A Report for the Objects and Variable Art Laboratory at the Indianapolis Museum of Art|journal=Indianapolis Museum of Art|year=2011|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;   During Dunn and Runge's stay on the island, the public was able to access and share their experiences through a wide spectrum of interactions. These experiences included personal Island visits, Island trades, floating lectures, floating messages, and communication through blogging.

* ''No Swimming,'' 2011, Katherine Ball.
Ball's residency focused on bringing awareness to the water quality of the 100 Acres lake and included developing a system that utilizes the filtering properties of mushrooms that may help reduce the level of contaminates and [[E. coli]] bacteria in the water. Her approach employed [[Mycofiltration|mycofilters]] constructed from burlap, wood chips, and [[mushroom]] [[mycelium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Herrmann|first=Angela|title=Katherine Ball: Living on Indianapolis Island|url=http://www.nuvo.net/gyrobase/katherine-ball-living-on-indy-island/Content?oid=2337937&amp;storyPage=1|accessdate=2011-08-30|newspaper=NUVO Newsweekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/island2011// |title=No Swimming, 2011 Indianapolis Island Residency (residency blog)|author=Katherine Bell |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Indigenous: Out of the Wild,'' 2012, A. Bitterman.
Bitterman spent six weeks interacting with 100 Acres and its visitors in order to explore the question "What is wild?" Using devices typically found in carefully mediated areas of wilderness like national parks, such as an informational kiosk and viewing stations, Bitterman inserted himself into the habitat and pulled viewers into the artistic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indigenous (June-July 2012)|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/100acres/artists/andreazittel/2012-island-resident|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bitterman crafted many methods for viewers to interact with him, such as using his invented lexicon of hand signals (Bitterman remained silent except when wearing a [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] [[beaver]] suit), bringing him food, and tracking him via GPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shoger|first=Scott|title=Nature is not your friend: A. Bitterman on Indy Island|journal=[[NUVO (newspaper)|NUVO]]|date=29 Jun 2012|url=http://www.nuvo.net/indianapolis/nature-is-your-enemy-a-bitterman-on-indy-island/Content?oid=2464676#.ULk0wmfNmfU|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His blog, including instructional video, can be found [http://www.imamuseum.org/island2012/ here]

* ''Island Fever,'' 2013, Rimas K. Simaitis.
During "Island Fever," Simaitis invited park visitors to communicate with the island through an on-shore radio that transmitted signals to ''Indy Island'' by way of two smaller, floating satellite islands. These smaller, outlying islands were made from Igloo coolers, and outfitted with an audio system, radio receivers and transmitters, and large keel fins to prevent the islands from tipping over. Simaitis prompted visitors to reflect on cosmic relationships and diplomacy at an onshore phone booth, and to then transmit their messages to ''Indy Island''. On the island Simaitis would operate a ham radio station and transmit visitors messages into space by way of a [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[Microwave]] transmitter with a tiki torch for an antenna. He also had an [[High frequency|HF]] [[Transceiver]] that he used to listen for radio signals around the world. The entire project was solar powered, with the intention of having the electronics become operable only when the sun was out.  For the project Simaitis earned his [[Amateur radio licensing in the United States|General Class amateur radio license]], operated under the [[call sign]] ''KI5LND'', and kept a blog which can be found [http://ki5lnd.tumblr.com here].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imamuseum.org/visit/100acres/artworks-projects/indy-island-residencies/2013-island-resident |title=2013 Residency|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Indianapolis Museum of Art|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location history===
This artwork was fabricated by Barnacle Bros: Sculpture &amp; Custom Fabrication, a professional fabrication studio based out of Los Angeles, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barnacle Bros: Sculpture &amp; Custom Fabrication|url=http://www.barnaclebros.com/|accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company's founder, Alessandro Thompson, and his associates transported the artwork in segments to Indianapolis, IN, and finished its fabrication on site at the IMA along with Zitell, who was also present for this process. The artwork was installed on the floating dock system and launched onto the lake in April 2010, and ready for the park's opening in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets.|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 29, 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
''Indianapolis Island'' is currently on temporary loan at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].

==Condition==
''Indianapolis Island'' is reviewed monthly from the shore to determine any major impact from its lake location and to check for any type of dock failure. The artwork is also periodically examined within close proximity, via rowboat, in order to accurately assess any major defects in the structure. These trips take place seasonally, with more frequent surveys taken place in the months directly preceding a new resident's occupancy. Documentation of the contents within the living space is considered an important component to the artwork and is an ongoing project.

'''Indigenous Community Television''' ('''ICTV''') is an Australian [[free-to-view]] digital television channel on the [[Viewer Access Satellite Television]] service. It broadcasts television programs produced by, and for, indigenous people in remote communities. The channel is owned by membership-based company Indigenous Community Television Limited. Although ICTV is a community television channel by name and content, it broadcasts using an [[narrowcasting|open-narrowcast]] licence instead of a standard [[Community television in Australia#Licensing|community television]] licence.

==History==

In 2001, ICTV Limited was formed and began broadcasting a part-time segment on Imparja Info Channel, an open-narrowcast community-style channel already broadcasting occasional indigenous content from Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Media (PY Media) and [[Warlpiri Media Association]] (PAW Media). The channel operated from Imparja's broadcast facility in [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory]],&lt;ref name="Launch1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was available on the [[Optus Aurora]] satellite service and via Imparja's analogue terrestrial transmitter network. The segment from ICTV was named 'IRCA in Action' and showcased predominantly local indigenous programs from a range of remote indigenous media organisations, including [[PAKAM]], Ngaanyatjarra Media (NG Media) and organisations such as Bushvision.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = dmy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2006, the programming from ICTV grew to encompass the channel 24 hours a day and the satellite channel was renamed to ICTV. Many remote indigenous communities in central and north eastern Australia had analogue terrestrial repeaters for this channel, which utilised community licences and later open-narrowcasting licences.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; In October 2006, ICTV was formally incorporated as a public company.&lt;ref name="History2" /&gt;

=== ICTV ceases transmission ===

On 12 July 2007, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts had implemented changes to the Indigenous Broadcasting Program in support of a new national indigenous TV channel. It was decided that the existing open-narrowcast licence from Imparja would be used to initially carry the channel, which resulted in ICTV ceasing transmission.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; For 2 years, ICTV Limited had no means of broadcasting content unless it was commissioned by [[National Indigenous Television]], which was at odds with the company. The NITV commissioning model allegedly left out remote community producers due to the nature of how funding was allocated and other mandatory requirements.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

ICTV Limited launched an online video service, [http://indigitube.com.au IndigiTube], in April 2009.

=== The revival of ICTV ===

After a successful appeal to the Government of Western Australia, ICTV resumed broadcasting part-time on [[Westlink (Australian TV channel)|Westlink Network]] on 13 November 2009. Westlink Network was already carried on the existing Optus Aurora service as an open-narrowcast channel. Programming from ICTV was scheduled every weekend from Friday night to Monday morning.&lt;ref name="ICTVonWestlink"&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = dmy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remote communities with analogue terrestrial repeaters had begun to install equipment to automatically switch the NITV channel to Westlink Network every weekend.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

On 28 May 2012, the [[Department of Communications (Australia)|Department for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy]] awarded ICTV with an open-narrowcast licence to broadcast on the [[Viewer Access Satellite Television]] service. The channel commenced trial transmissions on 6 December 2012.&lt;ref name="History2"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April 2013, ICTV officially relaunched and began broadcasting 24 hours a day on [[virtual channel]] number 601 in standard definition [[576i]] format. A launch party was held at the PAW Media grounds in [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory]] to mark the occasion.&lt;ref name="Launch2"&gt;{{cite web

'''Lenore Jackson Coffee''' (13 July 1896, [[San Francisco, California]] &amp;ndash; 2 July 1984, [[Woodland Hills, California]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[screenwriter]], [[playwright]] and [[novelist]].

==Biography==
Coffee began her career when she answered an ad requesting a screen story for the actress [[Clara Kimball Young]] and was awarded a one-year contract at $50 a week.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8021-1675-2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Silvester, Christopher|title=The Grove book of Hollywood|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York|year=2000|isbn=0-8021-1675-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was twice nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The first time was for ''[[Street of Chance (1930 film)|Street of Chance]]'' in 1929/30, adapted from the story by Oliver H. P. Garrett, in collaboration with [[Howard Estabrook]]; and the second was with [[Julius J. Epstein]] in 1938 for ''[[Four Daughters]]'', based on [[Fannie Hurst]]'s short story "Sister Act". Of the studio system, she is quoted as saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"They pick your brains, break your heart, ruin your digestion – and what do you get for it? Nothing but a lousy fortune."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coffee wrote many stories related to experiences women faced during her time, yet they were not met with great reviews and open arms. Coffee spent many years with [[Warner Bros.]], which she mentions in her autobiography as to being the only female writer. One hit that came out of that is the film ''Four Daughters'', which she cowrote with Julius J. Epstein.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Gale Page in Four Daughters trailer.jpg|thumb]]

Coffee married writer and director [[William J. Cowen]]. One of her ancestors was U.S. General [[John Coffee]], [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] to [[Andrew Jackson]] at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in 1814.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

A '''library''' is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/library|title=Library – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|website=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both.&lt;ref&gt;"Library ... collection of books, public or private; room or building where these are kept; similar collection of films, records, computer routines, etc. or place where they are kept; series of books issued in similar bindings as set." – Allen, R. E., ed. (1984) ''The Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; A library's collection can include [[book]]s, [[Periodical literature|periodicals]], [[newspaper]]s, [[manuscript]]s, [[film]]s, [[map collection|maps]], [[print room|prints]], [[document]]s, [[microform]], [[compact disc|CDs]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]], [[videotape]]s, [[DVD]]s, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Discs]], [[e-book]]s, [[audiobook]]s, [[database]]s, and other formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items. In Latin and Greek, the idea of a [[bookcase]] is represented by ''Bibliotheca'' and ''Bibliothēkē'' (Greek: βιβλιοθήκη): derivatives of these mean ''library'' in many modern languages, e.g. French ''bibliothèque''.

The first libraries consisted of [[archive]]s of the [[Writing#The beginning of writing|earliest form of writing]]—the [[clay tablet]]s in [[cuneiform script]] discovered in [[Sumer]], some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in [[classical Greece]] in the 5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of [[Imperial Library of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandria]].

A library is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, a corporation, or a private individual. Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to—or cannot afford to—purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of [[librarian]]s who are experts at finding and organizing information and at interpreting information needs. Libraries often provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often offer common areas to facilitate group study and collaboration. Libraries often provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources and the [[Internet]].

Modern libraries are increasingly being redefined as places to get unrestricted access to [[information]] in many formats and from many sources. They are extending services beyond the physical walls of a building, by providing material accessible by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians in navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of digital resources. Libraries are increasingly becoming community hubs where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning. As community centers, libraries are also becoming increasingly important in helping communities mobilize and organize for their rights. The relationship between [[librarianship and human rights]] works to ensure that the rights of cultural minorities, immigrants, the homeless, the disabled, LGBTQ community, as well as other marginalized groups are not infringed upon as protected in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

===Early libraries===
[[File:Library of Ashurbanipal The Flood Tablet.jpg|thumb|Tablet from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] containing part of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'']]
The first libraries consisted of [[archive]]s of the [[Writing#The beginning of writing|earliest form of writing]]—the [[clay tablet]]s in [[cuneiform script]] discovered in temple rooms in [[Sumer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ECBkVPQkNSsC&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Libraries in the Ancient World |first=Lionel |last=Casson |page=3 |publisher=Yale University Press |date=11 August 2002 |accessdate=7 March 2012|isbn=978-0300097214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Krasner&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history-magazine.com/libraries.html |title=History Magazine |first=Barbara |last=Krasner-Khait |website=history-magazine.com |year=2010 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; some dating back to 2600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/05/06_tablet.shtml |title=Clay cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia to be placed online |first=Kathleen |last=Maclay |date=6 May 2003 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These archives, which mainly consisted of the records of commercial transactions or inventories, mark the end of [[prehistory]] and the start of [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew, Colin. ''Prehistory The Making of the Human Mind'', New York: Modern Library, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3QZXvUhGwhAC&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A short history of the world |first=John Morris |page=35 |last=Roberts |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=17 July 1997 |accessdate=7 March 2012|isbn=9780195115048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Things were much the same in the government and temple records on [[papyrus]] of [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt; The earliest discovered private archives were kept at [[Ugarit]]; besides correspondence and inventories, texts of myths may have been standardized practice-texts for teaching new scribes. There is also evidence of libraries at [[Nippur]] about 1900 BC and those at [[Nineveh]] about 700 BC showing a [[library classification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;''The American International Encyclopedia'', New York: J. J. Little &amp; Ives, 1954; Volume IX&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 30,000 clay tablets from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] have been discovered at Nineveh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/ashurbanipal_library_phase_1.aspx |title="Assurbanipal Library Phase 1", British Museum One |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing modern scholars with an amazing wealth of Mesopotamian literary, religious and administrative work. Among the findings were the [[Enûma Eliš|Enuma Elish]], also known as ''the Epic of Creation'',&lt;ref&gt;"Epic of Creation", in [[Stephanie Dalley|Dalley, Stephanie]]. ''Myths from Mesopotamia.'' Oxford, 1989; pp. 233–81&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts a traditional Babylonian view of creation; the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'';&lt;ref&gt;"Epic of Gilgamesh", in Dalley, Stephanie. ''Myths from Mesopotamia.'' Oxford, 1989; pp. 50–135&lt;/ref&gt; a large selection of "omen texts" including ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' which "contained omens dealing with the moon, its visibility, eclipses, and conjunction with planets and fixed stars, the sun, its corona, spots, and eclipses, the weather, namely lightning, thunder, and clouds, and the planets and their visibility, appearance, and stations";&lt;ref&gt;Van De Mieroop, Marc. ''A History of the Ancient Near East ca. 3000–323 BC''. Oxford, UK: [[Blackwell Publishing]], 2007: pg. 263&lt;/ref&gt; and astronomic/astrological texts, as well as standard lists used by scribes and scholars such as word lists, bilingual vocabularies, lists of signs and synonyms, and lists of medical diagnoses.

The tablets were stored in a variety of containers such as wooden boxes, woven baskets of reeds, or clay shelves.  The "libraries" were cataloged using colophons, which are a publisher's imprint on the spine of a book, or in this case a tablet.  The colophons stated the series name, the title of the tablet, and any extra information the scribe needed to indicate.  Eventually, the clay tablets were organized by subject and size.  Unfortunately, due to limited to bookshelf space, once more tablets were added to the library, older ones were removed, which is why some tablets are missing from the excavated cities in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Weitemeyer, M. (1956). Archive and library technique in ancient Mesopotamia. ''Libri: International Journal of Libraries, 6''(3). 217–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, mythical philosopher [[Laozi]] was keeper of books in the earliest library in China, which belonged to the Imperial [[Zhou dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Mukherjee, A. K 1966 p. 86"&gt;Mukherjee, A. K. Librarianship: Its Philosophy and History. Asia Publishing House (1966) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Also, evidence of catalogues found in some destroyed ancient libraries illustrates the presence of librarians.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee, A. K 1966 p. 86"/&gt;

===Classical period===
[[File:Ancientlibraryalex.jpg|thumb|Artistic rendering of the [[Library of Alexandria]], based on some archaeological evidence]]
The [[Library of Alexandria]], in [[Egypt]], was the largest and most significant [[List of libraries in the ancient world|great library of the ancient world]].&lt;ref name="Sagan, C. 1980"&gt;Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Sagan, C 1980, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa1ImgOcOPM&amp;feature=related "Episode 1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean"]&lt;/ref&gt; It flourished under the patronage of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] (323–283 BC) or during the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;II]] (283–246 BC).&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"&gt;Phillips, Heather A., [http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm "The Great Library of Alexandria?". Library Philosophy and Practice, August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; An early organization system was in effect at Alexandria.&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"/&gt; The Great Library of Alexandria would remain as the intellectual capital of the Western World during the rise of Christianity, even after the library had suffered through fires and conquest. This Great library was more than a place to hold books and records, it became a place of culture. The Alexandrian book collections steadily diminished as a result of natural causes, war, and wholesale theft by corrupt administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Library of Celsus]] in [[Ephesus]], [[Anatolia]], now part of [[Selçuk]], [[Turkey]] was built in honor of the [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]] [[Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swain |first=Simon |title=Dio Chrysostom: Politics, Letters, and Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |page=57 |isbn=9780199255214 |quote=Nevertheless, in 92 the same office went to a Greek, Ti. Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, who belonged to a family of priests of Rome hailing from Sardis; entering the Senate under Vespasian, he was subsequently to be appointed proconsul of Asia under Trajan, possibly in 105/6. Celsus' son, Aquila, was also to be made suffectus in 110, although he is certainly remembered more as the builder of the famous library his father envisioned for Ephesus. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicols, John 1978 109"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nicols |first=John |title=Vespasian and the partes Flavianae |publisher=Steiner |year=1978 |page=109 |isbn=9783515023931 |quote=Ti. Julius Celsus Polemaeanus (PIR2 J 260) was a romanized Greek of Ephesus or Sardes who became the first eastern consul.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (completed in 135) by Celsus' son, Gaius Julius Aquila ([[consul]], 110 AD). The library was built to store 12,000 scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus.

Private or personal libraries made up of written books (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in archives) appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC. The celebrated book collectors of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] were listed in the late 2nd century in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]''. All these libraries were Greek. The cultivated Hellenized diners in ''Deipnosophistae'' pass over the libraries of Rome in silence. By the time of Augustus, there were public libraries near the forums of Rome. There were libraries in the [[Porticus Octaviae]] near the [[Theatre of Marcellus]], in the temple of Apollo Palatinus, and in the Bibliotheca Ulpiana in the [[Trajan's Forum|Forum of Trajan]]. The state archives were kept in a structure on the slope between the [[Roman Forum]] and the [[Capitoline Hill]].

Private libraries appeared during the late republic: [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime, but displayed the scrolls in bookcases (''armaria'') of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: "by now, like bathrooms and hot water, a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house (''[[domus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''De tranquillitate animi'' ix.4–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries were amenities suited to a villa, such as Cicero's at Tusculum, [[Gaius Maecenas|Maecenas]]'s several villas, or Pliny the Younger's, all described in surviving letters. At the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], apparently the villa of Caesar's father-in-law, the Greek library has been partly preserved in volcanic ash; archaeologists speculate that a Latin library, kept separate from the Greek one, may await discovery at the site.

In the West, the first public libraries were established under the [[Roman Empire]] as each succeeding emperor strove to open one or many which outshone that of his predecessor. Rome's first public library was established by [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]]. Pollio was a lieutenant of [[Julius Caesar]] and one of his most ardent supporters. After his military victory in Illyria, Pollio felt he had enough fame and fortune to create what Julius Caesar had sought for a long time: a public library to increase the prestige of Rome and rival the one in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, L. (2001). Libraries in the ancient world. New Haven: Yale University Press; Ewald, L. A. (2004). Library Culture in Ancient Rome, 100 B.C. – A.D. 400. Kentucky Libraries, 68(1), 9–11;Buchanan, S. (2012). Designing the Research Commons: Classical Models for School Libraries. School Libraries Worldwide, 18(1), 56–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollios's library, the ''Anla Libertatis'',&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, 2004, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; which was housed in the ''Atrium Libertatis'', was centrally located near the [[Roman Forum|Forum Romanum]]. It was the first to employ an architectural design that separated works into Greek and Latin. All subsequent Roman public libraries will have this design.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of Rome's civil wars following the death of [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] in 30 BC, the Emperor Augustus sought to reconstruct many of Rome's damaged buildings. During this construction, Augustus created two more public libraries. The first was the library of the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine, often called the [[Bibliotheca Palatina|Palatine library]], and the second was the library of the ''Porticus of Octaviae''.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p. 81; Buchanan, 2012, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more libraries were added by the [[Tiberius|Emperor Tiberius]] on Palatine Hill and one by Vespasian after 70 AD. Vespasian's library was constructed in the [[Imperial fora|Forum of Vespasian]], also known as the ''Forum of Peace'', and became one of Rome's principal libraries. The ''Bibliotheca Pacis'' was built along the traditional model and had two large halls with rooms for Greek and Latin libraries containing the works of Galen and Lucius Aelius.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p.84; Buchanan, 2012, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best preserved was the ancient [[Ulpian Library]] built by the Emperor Trajan. Completed in 112/113, the Ulpian Library was part of Trajan's Forum built on the Capitoline Hill. Trajan's Column separated the Greek and Latin rooms which faced each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, 2004, p.10; Buchanan, 2012, p.62; Casson, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was approximately fifty feet high with the peak of the roof reaching almost seventy feet.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, G. W. (2008). ''Tiberius and the Libraries: Public Book Collections and Library Buildings in the Early Roman Empire''. Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record, 43, 247–269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Greek libraries, readers had direct access to the scrolls, which were kept on shelves built into the walls of a large room. Reading or copying was normally done in the room itself. The surviving records give only a few instances of lending features. Most of the large [[Thermae|Roman baths]] were also cultural centres, built from the start with a library, a two-room arrangement with one room for Greek and one for Latin texts.

Libraries were filled with [[scroll|parchment scrolls]] as at [[Library of Pergamum]] and on [[papyrus]] scrolls as at [[Alexandria]]: the export of prepared writing materials was a staple of commerce. There were a few institutional or royal libraries which were open to an educated public (such as the Serapeum collection of the [[Library of Alexandria]], once the largest [[List of libraries in the ancient world|library in the ancient world]]),&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"/&gt; but on the whole collections were private. In those rare cases where it was possible for a scholar to consult library books, there seems to have been no direct access to the stacks. In all recorded cases, the books were kept in a relatively small room where the staff went to get them for the readers, who had to consult them in an adjoining hall or covered walkway. Most of the works in catalogs were of a religious nature, such as volumes of the Bible or religious service books. "In a number of cases the library was entirely theological and liturgical, and in the greater part of the libraries the non-ecclesiastical content did not reach one third of the total"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beddie, J. (1930). The Ancient Classics in the Mediaeval Libraries. ''Speculum'', 5(1), 3–20. {{doi|10.2307/2846353}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these types of works, in some libraries during that time Plato was especially popular. In the early Middle Ages, Aristotle was more popular. Additionally, there was quite a bit of censoring within libraries of the time; many works that were "scientific and metaphysical" were not included in the majority of libraries during that time period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Latin authors were better represented within library holdings and Roman works were less represented. Cicero was also an especially popular author along with the histories of Sallust.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, Virgil was universally represented at most of the medieval libraries of the time. One of the most popular was Ovid, mentioned by approximately twenty French catalogues and nearly thirty German ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Surprisingly, old Roman textbooks on grammar were still being used at that time.

[[Han Chinese]] scholar [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] established the first library classification system during the [[Han dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Late Antiquity===
[[File:Bibl. Malatestiana 3.jpg|thumb|[[Malatestiana Library]] of [[Cesena]], the first [[Europe]]an civic library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stradavinisaporifc.it/cesena.asp |title=Stradavinisaporifc.it |publisher=Stradavinisaporifc.it |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the Late Antiquity and Middle Ages periods, there was no Rome of the kind that ruled the Mediterranean for centuries and spawned the culture that produced twenty-eight public libraries in the ''urbs Roma''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernhard Bischoff|Bischoff, B.]] and [[Michael Gorman (librarian)|Gorman, M.]] (1994). ''Manuscripts and libraries in the age of Charlemagne''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The empire had been divided then later re-united again under [[Constantine the Great]] who moved the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330 AD to the city of Byzantium which was renamed [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, K. K. (2004). ''The history of the library in Western civilization''. New Castle, Del.: Oak Knoll Press, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman intellectual culture that flourished in ancient times was undergoing a transformation as the academic world moved from laymen to Christian clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; As the West crumbled, books and libraries flourished and flowed east toward the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; There, four different types of libraries were established: imperial, patriarchal, monastic, and private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papademetriou | first1 = G. C. | year = 2000 | title = The Patriarchal libraries of Constantinople | url = | journal = Greek Orthodox Theological Review | volume = 45 | issue = 1–4| pages = 171–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each had its own purpose and, as a result, their survival varied.

Christianity was a new force in Europe and many of the faithful saw Hellenistic culture as pagan. As such, many classical Greek works, written on scrolls, were left to decay as only Christian texts were thought fit for preservation in a codex, the progenitor of the modern book.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2011). ''Books: A living history''. London: Thames and Hudson, pp.&amp;nbps;35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;   In the East, however, this was not the case as many of these classical Greek and Roman texts were copied.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; "[F]ormerly paper was rare and expensive, so every spare page of available books was pressed into use. Thus a seventeenth-century edition of the Ignatian epistles, in Mar Saba, had copied onto its last pages, probably in the early eighteenth century, a passage allegedly from the letters of Clement of Alexandria".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. (1960). Monasteries and Their Manuscripts. Archaeology, 13(3), 172–177. {{JSTOR|41663782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old manuscripts were also used to bind new books because of the costs associated with paper and also because of the scarcity of new paper.

In Byzantium, much of this work devoted to preserving Hellenistic thought in codex form was performed in [[scriptorium]]s by monks.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, H. A. (2010). The genesis of monastic libraries. ''[[Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record]]'', 45(3), 320–332, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; While '''monastic library''' scriptoriums flourished throughout the East and West, the rules governing them were generally the same.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009; Peterson, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Barren and sun-lit rooms (because candles were a source of fire) were major features of the scriptorium that was both a model of production and monastic piety.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, pp. 36, −38&lt;/ref&gt; Monks scribbled away for hours a day, interrupted only by meals and prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; With such production, medieval monasteries began to accumulate large libraries. These libraries were devoted solely to the education of the monks and were seen as essential to their spiritual development.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, 2010, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of these texts that were produced were Christian in nature, many monastic leaders saw common virtues in the Greek classics. As a result, many of these Greek works were copied, and thus saved, in monastic scriptoriums.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, 2010, pp. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt;

When Europe passed into the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Byzantine scriptoriums laboriously preserved Greco-Roman classics. As a result, Byzantium revived Classical models of education and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J.W. (1957). The medieval library. New York: Hafner Publishing Co., p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Imperial Library of Constantinople]] was an important depository of ancient knowledge. Constantine himself wanted such a library but his short rule denied him the ability to see his vision to fruition. His son [[Constantius II]] made this dream a reality and created an '''imperial library''' in a portico of the royal palace.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1957, p. 312"&gt;Thompson, 1957, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; He ruled for 24 years and accelerated the development of the library and the intellectual culture that came with such a vast accumulation of books.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantius II appointed [[Themistius]], a pagan philosopher and teacher, as chief architect of this library building program. Themistius set about a bold program to create an imperial public library that would be the centerpiece of the new intellectual capital of [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoikos, 2007, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Classical authors such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Demosthenes]], [[Isocrates]], [[Thucydides]], [[Homer]], and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] were sought. Themeistius hired calligraphers and craftsman to produce the actual codices. He also appointed educators and created a university-like school centered around the library.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Constantius II, [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]], a bibliophile intellectual, ruled briefly for less than three years. Despite this, he had a profound impact on the imperial library and sought both Christian and pagan books for its collections.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1957, p. 312"/&gt; Later, the [[Valens|Emperor Valens]] hired Greek and Latin scribes full-time with funds from the royal treasury to copy and repair manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1957, pp. 312–313&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height in the 5th century, the Imperial Library of [[Constantinople]] had 120,000 volumes and was the largest library in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1957, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; A fire in 477 consumed the entire library but it was rebuilt only to be burned again in 726, 1204, and in 1453 when [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillerbrand|first1=Hans J.|title=On Book Burnings and Book Burners: Reflections on the Power (and Powerlessness) of Ideas|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|date=2006|volume=74|issue=3|pages=593–614|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfj117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patriarchal libraries''' fared no better, and sometimes worse, than the Imperial Library. The Library of the Patriarchate of Constantinople was founded most likely during the reign of Constantine the Great in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; As a theological library, it was known to have employed a [[library classification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; It also served as a repository of several [[ecumenical council]]s such as the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], [[Council of Ephesus]], and the [[Council of Chalcedon]]. The library, which employed a librarian and assistants, may have been originally located in the Patriarch's official residence before it was moved to the Thomaites Triclinus in the 7th century. While much is not known about the actual library itself, it is known that many of its contents were subject to destruction as religious in-fighting ultimately resulted in [[book burning]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, small '''private libraries''' existed. Many of these were owned by church members and the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p.429&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers also were known to have small personal libraries as well as wealthy bibliophiles who could afford the highly ornate books of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1957, pp.313–314&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in the 6th century, at the close of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina|Alexandria]]. [[Cassiodorus]], minister to Theodoric, established a monastery at Vivarium in the toe of Italy (modern Calabria) with a library where he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus not only collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of reading and methods for copying texts accurately. In the end, however, the library at Vivarium was dispersed and lost within a century.

Through [[Origen]] and especially the scholarly presbyter [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], an avid collector of books of Scripture, the theological school of Caesarea won a reputation for having the [[Theological Library of Caesarea Maritima|most extensive ecclesiastical library of the time]], containing more than 30,000 manuscripts: [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]], [[Jerome]], and others came and studied there.

===Islamic lands===
[[File:Chinguetti-biblio.jpg|thumb|Inside a Qur'anic Library in [[Chinguetti]], Mauritania]]
By the 8th century, first [[Iran]]ians and then [[Arabs]] had imported the craft of [[papermaking]] from China, with a [[paper mill]] already at work in [[Baghdad]] in 794. Early paper was called bagdatikos, meaning "from Baghdad", because it was introduced to the west mainly by this city.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, S. (2009). The library : an illustrated history. New York, NY : [[Skyhorse Pub.]] ; Chicago : ALA Editions, 2009. p.&amp;nbps;57&lt;/ref&gt; By the 9th century, [[Public library|public libraries]] started to appear in many Islamic cities. They were called "house of knowledge" or ''dar al-'ilm''. They were each endowed by [[Islam]]ic sects with the purpose of representing their tenets as well as promoting the dissemination of secular knowledge. The 9th-century [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Caliphate|Caliph]] [[al-Mutawakkil]] of [[Iraq]], ordered the construction of a "zawiyat qurra"&amp;nbsp;– an enclosure for readers which was "lavishly furnished and equipped". In [[Shiraz]], Adhud al-Daula (d. 983) set up a library, described by the medieval historian, [[al-Muqaddasi]], as "a complex of buildings surrounded by gardens with lakes and waterways. The buildings were topped with domes, and comprised an upper and a lower story with a total, according to the chief official, of 360 rooms.... In each [[Departmentalization|department]], [[Library catalog|catalogues]] were placed on a shelf... the rooms were furnished with carpets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Al-Muqaddasi: Ahsan al-Taqasim |editor=Goeje, M. J. de |year=1906 |encyclopedia=Bibliotheca geographorum Arabicorum |language=Arabic |volume=III |publisher=E. J. Brill |location=Leiden |pages=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The libraries often employed translators and copyists in large numbers, in order to render into [[Arabic]] the bulk of the available [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Roman and [[Sanskrit]] non-fiction and the classics of literature.

Organization was a strength of Islamic Libraries during the Golden Age (7th–14th century). In this period, books were organized by subject.  Within the subject, the materials were further organized by when the libraries gained the item, not by last name of the author or the title of the book. Also, Islamic libraries may be the first to have implemented a catalogue of owned materials. The content of a bookshelf was recorded on paper and attached to the end of shelf.
Arab-Islamic people also were very favorable of public knowledge. Public libraries were very popular along with mosque, private, and academic libraries. Instead of being available to the elite of society, such as caliphs and princes, information was something that was offered to everyone.  Some of the libraries were said to let patrons check out up to 200 items. These buildings were also made for comfort of the readers and information seekers. It was said that the rooms had carpets for sitting and reading comfortably. Also, openings such as doors and windows were secured closed as to protect patrons against cold drafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elayyan|first1=Ribhi Mustafa|title=The history of the Arabic-Islamic Libraries: 7th to 14th Centuries|journal=International Library Review|date=1990|volume=22|issue=2|pages=119–135|doi=10.1016/0020-7837(90)90014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flowering of Islamic learning ceased centuries later when learning began declining in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], after many of these libraries were destroyed by [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasions]]. Others were victim of wars and religious strife in the Islamic world. However, a few examples of these medieval libraries, such as the libraries of [[Chinguetti]] in [[West Africa]], remain intact and relatively unchanged. Another ancient library from this period which is still operational and expanding is the [[Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi]] in the Iranian city of [[Mashhad]], which has been operating for more than six centuries.

The contents of these Islamic libraries were copied by Christian monks in Muslim/Christian border areas, particularly Spain and Sicily. From there they eventually made their way into other parts of Christian [[Europe]]. These copies joined works that had been preserved directly by Christian monks from Greek and Roman originals, as well as copies Western Christian monks made of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] works. The resulting conglomerate libraries are the basis of every modern library today.

[[Buddhist texts|Buddhist scriptures]], educational materials, and histories were stored in libraries in pre-modern [[Southeast Asia]]. In [[Myanmar|Burma]], a royal library called the [[Pitakataik]] was legendarily founded by King [[Anawrahta]];&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zoq_TtEN54IC&amp;pg=PA29 International dictionary of library histories]'', 29&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th century, British envoy [[Michael Symes (diplomat)|Michael Symes]], on visiting this library, wrote that "it is not improbable that his Birman majesty may possess a more numerous library than any potentate, from the banks of the Danube to the borders of China". In Thailand, libraries called [[ho trai]] were built throughout the country, usually on stilts above a pond to prevent bugs from eating at the books.

====Islam====
[[File:Flickr - dlisbona - Old Koran manuscript, Alexandria library.jpg|thumb|Qur'an manuscript on display at the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
The centrality of the [[Quran|Qurʾān]] as the prototype of the written word in [[Islam]] bears significantly on the role of books within its intellectual tradition and educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nasr |first1=Seyyed Hossein |year=1992 |title=Oral Transmission and The Book in Islamic Education: The Spoken and The Written Word |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1093/jis/3.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early impulse in Islam was to manage reports of events, key figures and their sayings and actions. Thus, "the onus of being the last '[[People of the Book]]' engendered an ethos of [librarianship]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nanji |first1=Azim |editor1-first=Hermann |editor1-last=Landolt |editor2-first=Samira |editor2-last=Sheikh |editor3-first=Kutub |editor3-last=Kassam |title=An Anthology of Ismaili Literature: A Shi'i Vision of Islam |year=2008 |publisher=IB Tauris |location=London |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; early on and the establishment of important book repositories throughout the Muslim world has occurred ever since.

Upon the spread of Islam, libraries in [[Islamic Golden Age|newly Islamic lands]] knew a brief period of expansion in the Middle East, [[North Africa]], [[Sicily]], and [[Spain]]. Like the Christian libraries, they mostly contained books which were made of [[paper]], and took a [[codex]] or modern form instead of scrolls; they could be found in mosques, private homes, and universities, from [[Timbuktu]] to [[Afghanistan]] and modern day [[Pakistan]]. In [[Aleppo]], for example, the largest and probably the oldest mosque library, the Sufiya, located at the city's Grand Umayyad Mosque, contained a large book collection of which 10,000 volumes were reportedly bequeathed by the city's most famous ruler, Prince Sayf al-Dawla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sibai |first=Mohamed Makki |title=Mosque libraries: An Historical Study |year=1987 |publisher=Mansell Publishing Limited |page=71 |isbn=978-0-7201-1896-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn al-Nadim]]'s bibliography ''Fihrist'' demonstrates the devotion of medieval Muslim scholars to books and reliable sources; it contains a description of thousands of books circulating in the Islamic world circa 1000, including an entire section for books about the doctrines of other religions. Modern Islamic libraries for the most part do not hold these antique books; many were lost, [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destroyed by Mongols]],&lt;ref&gt;Chief among the libraries destroyed by the Mongol hordes was that of the Shia Ismaili Muslim community who occupied a network of mountain fortresses – lead from the castle of Alamut – beginning from the end of the eleventh century to about 1256. "The Fatimids and their successors at Alamut were great lovers and patrons of books, and their vast libraries attracted scholars of every creed from far and wide. The Imam al-Hakim even provided ink, pens, paper, and inkstands free of charge for all who sought learning in the 'House of Knowledge' (dār al-ʿilm). We can only imagine the horror the Ismailis would have felt when they witnessed the destruction of the literary legacy they had so painstakingly fostered. Al-Maqrizi (d.845/1442) describes how great hills of ashes were formed when the slaves and maids of the Luwata Berber tribe burned the Fatimid books. As an act of further desecration, they used the precious bindings of the volumes to make sandals for their feet. Similarly, Juwayni exults at torching the Ismaili library of Alamut, "the fame of which", he adds, "had spread throughout the world".

===European Middle Ages===
[[File:13-11-02-olb-by-RalfR-03.jpg|thumb|Science library of Upper Lusatia in Görlitz, Germany]]
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], monastery libraries developed, such as the important one at the [[Monte Cassino|Abbey of Montecassino]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crossingitaly.net/travel/936/montecassino-one-of-the-most-important-libraries-in-the-world/ |title=Montecassino, one of the most important libraries in the world |website=crossingitaly.net |year=2012 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books were usually [[chained library|chained to the shelves]], reflecting the fact that [[manuscript]]s, which were created via the labour-intensive process of hand copying, were valuable possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jM-OY0LCHCEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Chained+libraries#v=onepage&amp;q=Chained%20libraries&amp;f=false |title=The Chained Library |first=Burnett Hillman |last=Streeter |authorlink=Burnett Hillman Streeter |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2012|isbn=9781108027892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hand-copying was often accomplished by travelling monks who made the treks to the sources of knowledge and illumination they sought for learning or to copy the manuscripts held by other monasteries for their own monastic libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Books: A Living History |last=Lyons |first=Martyn |publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum |year=2011 |isbn= |location=Los Angeles, CA |pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this protectiveness, many libraries loaned books if provided with security deposits (usually money or a book of equal value). Lending was a means by which books could be copied and spread. In 1212, the council of Paris condemned those monasteries that still forbade loaning books, reminding them that lending is "one of the chief works of mercy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Putnam |first=Geo. Haven |title=Books and Their Makers in the Middle Ages |year=1962 |publisher=Hillary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early libraries located in monastic [[cloister]]s and associated with [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] were collections of lecterns with books chained to them. Shelves built above and between back-to-back lecterns were the beginning of [[Bookcase|bookpresses]]. The chain was attached at the fore-edge of a book rather than to its spine. Book presses came to be arranged in [[carrel desk|carrels]] (perpendicular to the walls and therefore to the windows) in order to maximize lighting, with low bookcases in front of the windows. This "stall system" (i.e. fixed bookcases perpendicular to exterior walls pierced by closely spaced windows) was characteristic of English institutional libraries. In European libraries, bookcases were arranged parallel to and against the walls. This "wall system" was first introduced on a large scale in Spain's [[El Escorial]].

Also, in [[Eastern Christianity]] monastery libraries kept important manuscripts. The most important of them were the ones in the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]] for [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], and the library of the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]] for the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]].

===Renaissance===
[[File:Biblioteca medicea laurenziana interno 01.JPG|thumb|Reading room of the [[Laurentian Library]]]]
From the 15th century in central and northern Italy, libraries of [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and their enlightened patrons provided a nucleus around which an "[[academy]]" of scholars congregated in each Italian city of consequence. [[Malatesta Novello]], [[Signoria|lord]] of [[Cesena]], founded the [[Malatestiana Library]]. [[Cosimo de' Medici]] in [[Florence]] established his own collection, which formed the basis of the [[Laurentian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-magazine.com/libraries.html Survivor: the History of the Library], history-magazine.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, the papal collections were brought together by [[Pope Nicholas V]], in separate Greek and Latin libraries, and housed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], who consigned the [[Vatican Library|Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana]] to the care of his librarian, the humanist [[Bartolomeo Platina]] in February 1475.&lt;ref&gt;This section on Roman Renaissance libraries follows Kenneth M.

In the 16th century, [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] bisected Bramante's [[Cortile del Belvedere]] with a cross-wing to house the Apostolic Library in suitable magnificence. The 16th and 17th centuries saw other privately endowed libraries assembled in Rome: the [[Biblioteca Vallicelliana|Vallicelliana]], formed from the books of Saint [[Philip Neri|Filippo Neri]], with other distinguished libraries such as that of [[Caesar Baronius|Cesare Baronio]], the [[Biblioteca Angelica]] founded by the Augustinian [[Angelo Rocca]], which was the only truly public library in Counter-Reformation Rome; the Biblioteca Alessandrina with which [[Pope Alexander VII]] endowed the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]]; the [[Biblioteca Casanatense]] of the Cardinal [[Girolamo Casanata]]; and finally the Biblioteca Corsiniana founded by the bibliophile [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII Corsini]] and his nephew Cardinal Neri Corsini, still housed in Palazzo Corsini in via della Lungara. The [[Republic of Venice]] patronized the foundation of the [[Biblioteca Marciana]], based on the library of Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion]]. In Milan, Cardinal [[Federico Borromeo]] founded the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].

This trend soon spread outside of Italy, for example [[Louis III, Elector Palatine]] founded the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] of [[Heidelberg]].

These libraries don't have as many volumes as the modern libraries. However, they keep many valuable manuscripts of Greek, Latin, and Biblical works.

[[Tian Yi Ge|Tianyi Chamber]], founded in 1561 by Fan Qin during the [[Ming dynasty]], is the oldest existing library in China. In its heyday, it boasted a collection of 70,000 volumes of antique books.

At the start of the 18th century, libraries were becoming increasingly public and were more frequently lending libraries. The 18th century saw the switch from closed parochial libraries to lending libraries. Before this time, public libraries were parochial in nature and libraries frequently chained their books to desks.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966) ''Early Public Libraries: a history of public libraries in Great Britain before 1850'' London: Library Association; p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries also were not uniformly open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Predeek, Albert (1947) ''A History of Libraries in Great Britain and North America''. Chicago: American Library Association; p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the [[British Museum]] existed at this time and contained over 50,000 books, the national library was not open to the public, or even to a majority of the population. Access to the Museum depended on passes, of which there was sometimes a waiting period of three to four weeks. Moreover, the library was not open to browsing. Once a pass to the library had been issued, the reader was taken on a tour of the library. Many readers complained that the tour was much too short.&lt;ref&gt;Battles, Matthew (2003) ''Library: an unquiet history''; p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subscription libraries====
{{main|Subscription library}}
[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|right|The [[British Museum]] was established in 1751 and had a library containing over 50,000 books.]]
At the start of the 19th century, there were virtually no public libraries in the sense in which we now understand the term i.e. libraries provided from public funds and freely accessible to all.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 185"&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Only one important library in Britain, namely [[Chetham's Library]] in Manchester, was fully and freely accessible to the public.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 185"/&gt; However, there had come into being a whole network of library provision on a private or institutional basis.

The increase in secular literature at this time encouraged the spread of lending libraries, especially the commercial [[subscription library|subscription libraries]]. Many small, private book clubs evolved into subscription libraries, charging high annual fees or requiring subscribing members to purchase shares in the libraries. The materials available to subscribers tended to focus on particular subject areas, such as [[biography]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[travel]], rather than works of fiction, particularly the novel.

Unlike a [[public library]], access was often restricted to members. Some of the earliest such institutions were founded in late 17th century England, such as [[Chetham's Library]] in 1653, [[Innerpeffray Library]] in 1680, and [[Thomas Plume|Thomas Plume's Library]] in 1704. In the [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonies]], the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]] was started in 1731 by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in Philadelphia.

Parochial libraries attached to Anglican parishes or Nonconformist chapels in Britain emerged in the early 18th century, and prepared the way for local public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts: 1616–1714'' (2nd ed. 1956) p 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing production and demand for fiction promoted by commercial markets led to the rise of [[circulating library|circulating libraries]], which met a need that subscription libraries did not fulfil. William Bathoe claimed that his commercial venture was "the Original Circulating library", opening doors at two locations in London in 1737.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;Raven, James. "Libraries for sociability: the advance of subscription library." The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=picture1807&gt;{{cite book |last=Feltham |first=John |authorlink=John Feltham |title=Picture of London, for 1807 |publisher=Richard Phillips |edition=8th |location=London |chapter=Circulating Libraries |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=j9MHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Circulating libraries also charged subscription fees to users and offered serious subject matter as well as the popular novels, thus the difficulty in clearly distinguishing circulating from subscription libraries.&lt;ref name=Eliot&gt;Eliot, Simon. "Circulating libraries in the Victorian age and after." The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vogel Załuski Library.jpg|thumb|left|[[Załuski Library|Biblioteka Załuskich]], built in [[Warsaw]] in the mid 18th century]]
Subscription libraries were democratic in nature; created by and for communities of local subscribers who aimed to establish permanent collections of books and reading materials, rather than selling their collections annually as the circulating libraries tended to do, in order to raise funds to support their other commercial interests. Even though the subscription libraries were often founded by reading societies, committees, elected by the subscribers, chose books for the collection that were general, rather than aimed at a particular religious, political or professional group. The books selected for the collection were chosen because they would be mutually beneficial to the shareholders. The committee also selected the librarians who would manage the circulation of materials.&lt;ref name=Forster&gt;Forster, Geoffrey, and Alan Bell. "The subscription libraries and their members." The Cambridge History of Libraries in Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, there were more than 200 commercial circulating libraries open in 1800, more than twice the number of subscription and private proprietary libraries that were operating at the same time.  Many proprietors pandered to the most fashionable clientele, making much ado about the sort of shop they offered, the lush interiors, plenty of room and long hours of service.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt; "These 'libraries' would be called rental collections today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harris |first=Michael H. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0810829725 |publication-place=Metuchen, N.J |title=History of libraries in the western world |publication-date=1995|date=January 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private Subscription Libraries====
[[File:Linen Hall Library, 1888.jpg|thumb|The [[Linen Hall Library]] in Belfast was an 18th-century [[subscription library]]. Pictured in 1888, shortly before its demolition.]]
Private subscription libraries functioned in much the same manner as commercial subscription libraries, though they varied in many important ways. One of the most popular versions of the private subscription library was a gentleman's only library. Membership was restricted to the proprietors or shareholders, and ranged from a dozen or two to between four and five hundred.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 128"&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liverpool [[Subscription library|Subscription Library]] was a gentlemen only library. In 1798, it was renamed the Athenaeum when it was rebuilt with a newsroom and coffeehouse. It had an entrance fee of one guinea and annual subscription of five shillings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the registers for the first twelve years provides glimpses of middle-class reading habits in a mercantile community at this period. The largest and most popular sections of the library were History, Antiquities, and Geography, with 283 titles and 6,121 borrowings, and Belles Lettres, with 238 titles and 3,313 borrowings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul. Libraries and Their Users. Page 29. The Library Association. 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Donald McDonald, stationer, and his Circulating Library, Gulgong, 1870.jpg|left|thumb| [[Circulating library]] and stationery shop, [[Gulgong]], Australia 1870]]
Private subscription libraries held a greater amount of control over both membership and the types of books in the library. There was almost a complete elimination of cheap fiction in the private societies.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul (1969); p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Subscription libraries prided themselves on respectability. The highest percentage of subscribers were often landed proprietors, gentry, and old professions.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, David (2008); p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  

Towards the end of the 18th century and in the first decades of the nineteenth, the need for books and general education made itself felt among social classes created by the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Raymond (1964); p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The late 18th century saw a rise in subscription libraries intended for the use of tradesmen. In 1797, there was established at Kendal what was known as the Economical Library, "designed principally for the use and instruction of the working classes".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the Artizans' library established at Birmingham in 1799. The entrance fee was 3 shillings. The subscription was 1 shilling 6 pence per quarter. This was a library of general literature. Novels, at first excluded, were afterwards admitted on condition that they did not account for more than one-tenth of the annual income.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 128"/&gt;

Benjamin Franklin lead the founding of the first American subscription library. In Philadelphia, Franklin formed "a club of mutual improvements".. calling themselves the "Junto", which meant a council or a combination of individuals organized for a specific purpose. Because the men in this club had a steady income, they could afford to be apart of this club and afford to purchase books. Only some had enough to be considered a library; together they shared what they all had.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=1602397066|location=|pages=145-147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National libraries===
{{main|National library}}
[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] is but one of the treasures made available in the [[British Museum]] upon its establishment in 1753.]]
The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state. This era is termed the "golden age of libraries", with millions of printed books available and widespread interest growing in both national and classical literature. National libraries would eventually become objects of pride in that same spirit, most Europeans considered themselves as belonging to a nation first and a religion second. Wars of religion would give way to wars of nationalism, as fierce and widespread as ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would become a major turning point for many libraries and their collections. 

One of the first plans for a national library was devised by the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[John Dee]], who in 1556 presented [[Mary I of England]] with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books, manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library, but his proposal was not taken up.&lt;ref&gt;Fell-Smith, Charlotte (1909) ''John Dee: 1527–1608''. London: Constable and Company [http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/ Available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true national library was founded in 1753 as part of the [[British Museum]].
This new institution was the first of a new kind of museum – national, belonging to neither church nor the king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything.&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dunton |first=Larkin |title=The World and Its People |publisher=Silver, Burdett |year=1896 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's foundations lay in the will of the physician and naturalist [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane]], who gathered an enviable [[cabinet of curiosities|collection of curiosities]] over his lifetime which he bequeathed to the nation for £20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html |title=Creating a Great Museum: Early Collectors and The British Museum |publisher=Fathom |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102202555/http://fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html |archivedate= 2 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane's collection included some 40,000 printed books and 7,000 [[manuscript]]s, as well as [[Old master print|prints]] and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/history/general_history.aspx|title=General history|website=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Museum Act 1753]] also incorporated the [[Cotton library]] and the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Harleian library]]. These were joined in 1757 by the Royal Library, assembled by various [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchs]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Charles Long (1823), BMCE115/3,10. Scrapbooks and illustrations of the Museum. (Wilson, David, M.) (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, pg 346&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the first national library was the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], which evolved from its origin as a royal library founded at the [[Louvre Palace]] by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1368. The appointment of [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]] as librarian in the 17th century, initiated a period of development that made it the largest and richest collection of books in the world.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt; The library opened to the public in 1692, under the administration of [[Camille le Tellier de Louvois|Abbé Louvois]], Minister Louvois's son. Abbé Louvois was succeeded by the [[Jérôme Bignon|Abbé Bignon]], or Bignon II as he was termed, who instituted a complete reform of the library's system. Catalogues were made, which appeared from 1739 to 1753 in 11 volumes. The collections increased steadily by purchase and gift to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], at which time it was in grave danger of partial or total destruction, but owing to the activities of Antoine-Augustin Renouard and [[Joseph Van Praet]] it suffered no injury.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

The library's collections swelled to over 300,000 volumes during the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|radical phase]] of the [[French Revolution]], when the private libraries of aristocrats and clergy were seized. After the establishment of the [[French First Republic]] in September 1792, "the Assembly declared the ''Bibliotheque du Roi'' to be national property and the institution was renamed the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]]''. After four centuries of control by the Crown, this great library now became the property of the French people."&lt;ref name=priebe&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Paul M. |last1=Priebe|title=From Bibliothèque du Roi to Bibliothèque Nationale: The Creation of a State Library, 1789–1793|journal= The Journal of Library History (1974–1987)|volume= 17|issue= 4 |pages=389–408|date= 1982|jstor=25541320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern public library===
{{main|Public library}}
[[File:James Silk Buckingham by Clara S. Lane.jpg|thumb|[[James Silk Buckingham]] led the campaign for public libraries in the mid 19th century.]]
Although by the mid-19th century, England could claim 274 [[subscription library|subscription libraries]] and Scotland, 266, the foundation of the modern public library system in Britain is the [[Public Libraries Act 1850]]. The Act first gave local [[municipal borough|boroughs]] the power to establish free public libraries and was the first legislative step toward the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature. In the 1830s, at the height of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. The [[Capitalism|Capitalist]] economic model had created a significant amount of free time for workers, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers' free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism rather than by demand from the lower social orders.&lt;ref&gt;McMenemy (2009), pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm |title=History of the Public Libraries Act |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316170538/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm |archivedate=16 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, and against government opposition, [[James Silk Buckingham]], MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the [[temperance movement]], was able to secure the Chair of the [[Parliamentary select committees of the United Kingdom|Select Committee]] which would examine "the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom" and propose solutions. [[Francis Place]], a campaigner for the working class, agreed that, "The establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford".&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee on inquiry into drunkenness, ''Report'' (1834)&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham introduced to Parliament a Public Institution Bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on [[William Ewart (British politician)|William Ewart]] MP and [[Joseph Brotherton]] MP, who introduced a bill which would "[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a ½d for the establishment of museums".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly &amp; Kelly (1977), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This became the [[Museums Act 1845]].

The advocacy of Ewart and Brotherton then succeeded in having a select committee set up to consider public library provision. The Report argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the Committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Minto (1932) chapters 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murison (1971) chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansard (1850) Col. 848&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill passed through [[Parliament]] as most MPs felt that public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, and that the greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower [[crime statistics|crime rates]].

The earliest example in England of a library to be endowed for the benefit of users who were not members of an institution such as a cathedral or college was the [[Francis Trigge Chained Library]] in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]], established in 1598. The library still exists and can justifiably claim to be the forerunner of later public library systems. The beginning of the modern, free, open access libraries really got its start in the UK in 1847. [[Parliament]] appointed a committee, led by William Ewart, on Public Libraries to consider the necessity of establishing libraries through the nation: In 1849, their report noted the poor condition of library service, it recommended the establishment of free public libraries all over the country, and it led to the Public Libraries Act in 1850, which allowed all cities with populations exceeding 10,000 to levy taxes for the support of public libraries.

Norwich was the eleventh library to open, in 1857, after [[Winchester]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Bolton]], [[Kidderminster]], [[Cambridge]], [[Birkenhead]], and [[Sheffield]].

Another important act was the [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Education Act 1870]], which increased literacy and thereby the demand for libraries. By 1877, more than 75 cities had established free libraries, and by 1900 the number had reached 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Michael H. |title=The History of Libraries in the Western World |year=1984 |location=London |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-1666-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finally marks the start of the public library as we know it. And these acts influenced similar laws in other countries, such as the US. The first tax-supported public library in the United States was [[Peterborough]], [[New Hampshire]] (1833) first supported by state funds then an "Act Providing for the Establishment of Public Libraries" in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shera |first=Jesse H. |title=Foundations of the Public Library: The Origins of the Public Library Movement in New England, 1629–1855 |year=1949 |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The American School Library]] (1839) was an early frontier traveling library in the [[United States]]. The year 1876 is key in the history of librarianship in the United States. The [[American Library Association]] was formed on October 6,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/node/530/|title=ALA Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''The [[American Library Journal]]'', [[Melvil Dewey]] published his [[Dewey Decimal Classification|decimal-based system]] of classification, and the United States Bureau of Education published its report, "Public libraries in the United States of America; their history, condition, and management."  During the post-Civil War years, there was a rise in the establishment of public libraries, a movement led chiefly by newly formed [[Women's club (United States)|women's clubs]]. They contributed their own collections of books, conducted lengthy fund raising campaigns for buildings, and lobbied within their communities for financial support for libraries, as well as with legislatures and the [[Carnegie library]] Endowment founded in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Paula D. Watson, "Founding Mothers: The Contribution of Woman's Organizations to Public Library Development in the United States", ''Library Quarterly'', Vol. 64, Issue 3, 1994, p.236&lt;/ref&gt;  They led the establishment of 75–80 percent of the libraries in communities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Teva Scheer, "The "Praxis" Side of the Equation: Club Women and American Public Administration", ''Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis'', Vol. 24, Issue 3, 2002, p.525&lt;/ref&gt;

Philanthropists and businessmen, including John Passmore Edwards, [[Henry Tate]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]], helped to increase the number of public libraries from the late 19th century. Carnegie alone built over 2000 libraries in the US, 660 [[Carnegie library|Carnegie Libraries]] in Britain, in addition to many more in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Theodore |title=Carnegie Libraries across America |publisher=Preservation Press |location=Washington |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-471-14422-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie also funded academic libraries, favoring small schools and schools with African American students.  "In 1899, Pennsylvania State College became the first college to receive Carnegie funding ($150,000) and their library was constructed in 1903."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ryan |first1=S |title='An Idea Likely Too Big': John B. Stetson University's Pursuit of an Academic Carnegie Library in the Early Twentieth Century |journal=Library &amp; Information History |date=2013 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=38–58 |doi=10.1179/1758348912Z.00000000027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Many institutions make a distinction between a circulating or [[lending library]], where materials are expected and intended to be loaned to patrons, institutions, or other libraries, and a reference library where material is not lent out. Travelling libraries, such as the early horseback libraries of eastern Kentucky&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Amazing Story of Kentucky's Horseback Librarians (10 Photos)|url=http://archiveproject.com/the-horseback-librarians-of-eastern-kentucky-10-photos|website=Archive Project|accessdate=19 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bookmobiles]], are generally of the lending type. Modern libraries are often a mixture of both, containing a general collection for circulation, and a reference collection which is restricted to the library premises. Also, increasingly, digital collections enable broader access to material that may not circulate in print, and enables libraries to expand their collections even without building a larger facility.

===Academic libraries===
{{Main|Academic library}}

[[File:Cmglee London Maughan Library reading room.jpg|thumb|The round reading room of [[Maughan Library]], the main university library of [[King's College London]]]]
Academic libraries are generally located on college and university campuses and primarily serve the students and faculty of that and other academic institutions. Some academic libraries, especially those at public institutions, are accessible to members of the general public in whole or in part.

[[File:Egyetemi Könyvtár4.JPG|thumb|left|The University Library in [[Budapest]]]]
Academic libraries are libraries that are hosted in post-secondary educational institutions, such as colleges and universities. Their main function are to provide support in research and resource linkage for students and faculty of the educational institution. Specific course-related resources are usually provided by the library, such as copies of textbooks and article readings held on 'reserve' (meaning that they are loaned out only on a short-term basis, usually a matter of hours). Some academic libraries provide resources not usually associated with libraries, such as the ability to check out laptop computers, web cameras, or scientific calculators.

Academic libraries offer workshops and courses outside of formal, graded coursework, which are meant to provide students with the tools necessary to succeed in their programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.library.utoronto.ca/workshops/|title=St. George Library Workshops|website=utoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workshops may include help with citations, effective search techniques, journal databases, and electronic citation software. These workshops provide students with skills that can help them achieve success in their academic careers (and often, in their future occupations), which they may not learn inside the classroom.

[[File:Robartslibrary.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Robarts Library]] at the [[University of Toronto]], Canada.]]
The academic library provides a quiet study space for students on campus; it may also provide group study space, such as meeting rooms. In North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, academic libraries are becoming increasingly digitally oriented. The library provides a "gateway" for students and researchers to access various resources, both print/physical and digital.&lt;ref&gt;Dowler, Lawrence (1997). ''Gateways to knowledge: the role of academic libraries in teaching, learning, and research''. {{ISBN|0-262-04159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic institutions are subscribing to electronic journals databases, providing research and scholarly writing software, and usually provide computer workstations or computer labs for students to access journals, library search databases and portals, institutional electronic resources, Internet access, and course- or task-related software (i.e. word processing and spreadsheet software). Some academic libraries take on new roles, for instance, acting as an electronic repository for institutional scholarly research and academic knowledge, such as the collection and curation of digital copies of students' theses and dissertations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/anunobi-okoye.htm |title=The Role of Academic Libraries in Universal Access to Print and Electronic Resources in the Developing Countries, Chinwe V. Anunobi, Ifeyinwa B. Okoye |publisher=Unllib.unl.edu |accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/|title=TSpace|website=utoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, academic libraries are increasingly acting as publishers on their own on a not-for-profit basis, especially in the form of fully [[Open Access]] institutional publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lepublikateur.de/2018/05/21/library-publishing/|title=Library Publishing, or How to Make Use of Your Opportunities|date=2018-05-21|work=LePublikateur|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's libraries===
[[File:Children. Children's Library in N.D.G BAnQ Vieux-Montréal P48S1P08742.jpg|thumb|left|A children's library in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada in 1943]]
[[Children's libraries]] are special collections of books intended for juvenile readers and usually kept in separate rooms of general public libraries. Some children's libraries have entire floors or wings dedicated to them in bigger libraries while smaller ones may have a separate room or area for children. They are an educational agency seeking to acquaint the young with the world's literature and to cultivate a love for reading. Their work supplements that of the public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Americana|last=Modell |first=David A. |wstitle=Children's Libraries|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Services commonly provided by public libraries may include storytelling sessions for infants, toddlers, preschool children, or after-school programs, all with an intention of developing early literacy skills and a love of books. One of the most popular programs offered in public libraries are summer reading programs for children, families, and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Udomisor, I., Udomisor, E., &amp; Smith, E. (2013). Management of Communication Crisis in a Library and Its Influence on Productivity. In Information and Knowledge Management (Vol. 3, No. 8, pp. 13–21)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular reading program for children is PAWS TO READ or similar programs where children can read to certified therapy dogs. Since animals are a calming influence and there is no judgment, children learn confidence and a love of reading. Many states have these types of programs: parents need simply ask their librarian to see if it is available at their local library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paws to read|url=http://www.readingpaws.org/READingPaws/Welcome.html|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National libraries===
[[File:National Library of Wales.jpg|thumb|[[National Library of Wales]]]]
{{Main|National library}}
A [[national library|national or state library]] serves as a national repository of information, and has the right of [[legal deposit]], which is a legal requirement that publishers in the country need to deposit a copy of each publication with the library. Unlike a public library, a national library rarely allows citizens to borrow books. Often, their collections include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works. There are wider definitions of a national library, putting less emphasis on the [[Institutional repository|repository]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Line, Maurice B.; Line, J. (1979). "Concluding notes". ''National libraries'', Aslib, pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lor, P. J.; Sonnekus, E. A. S. (1997). [http://www.ifla.org/VII/s1/gnl/index.htm "Guidelines for Legislation for National Library Services"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813200532/http://www.ifla.org/VII/s1/gnl/index.htm |date=13 August 2006 }}, [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|IFLA]]. Retrieved on 10 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state.

Many national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards, and carry out projects helping them to fulfil their duties. The national libraries of Europe participate in [[European Library|The European Library]] which is a service of the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL).

===Public lending libraries===
{{Main|Public library}}
[[File:Biblioteka Raczyńskich.jpg|thumb|[[Raczyński Library]], the public library of [[Poznań]], Poland]]

A public library provides services to the general public. If the library is part of a [[county]]wide library system, citizens with an active library card from around that county can use the library branches associated with the library system. A library can serve only their city, however, if they are not a member of the county public library system. Much of the materials located within a public library are available for borrowing. The library staff decides upon the number of items patrons are allowed to borrow, as well as the details of borrowing time allotted.  Typically, libraries issue [[library card]]s to community members wishing to borrow books. Often visitors to a city are able to obtain a public library card.

Many public libraries also serve as community organizations that provide free services and events to the public, such as reading groups and toddler story time. For many communities, the library is a source of connection to a vast world, obtainable knowledge and understanding, and entertainment. According to a study by the [[Pennsylvania Library Association]], public library services play a major role in fighting rising illiteracy rates among youths.&lt;ref&gt;Celano, D., &amp; Neumann, S. B. (2001). The role of public libraries in children's literacy development: An evaluation report. Pennsylvania, PA: Pennsylvania Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Public libraries are protected and funded by the public they serve.
[[File:Bates Hall - Boston Public Library.jpg|thumb|Bates Hall, the main reading room of the [[Boston Public Library]]]]

As the number of books in libraries have steadily increased since their inception, the need for compact storage and access with adequate lighting has grown. The ''[[library stack|stack system]]'' involves keeping a library's collection of books in a space separate from the reading room. This arrangement arose in the 19th century. Book stacks quickly evolved into a fairly standard form in which the [[cast iron]] and [[steel]] frameworks supporting the bookshelves also supported the floors, which often were built of translucent blocks to permit the passage of light (but were not transparent, for reasons of modesty). The introduction of [[electric light|electrical lighting]] had a huge impact on how the library [[lighting in libraries|operated]]. The use of glass floors was largely discontinued, though floors were still often composed of metal grating to allow air to circulate in multi-story stacks. As more space was needed, a method of moving shelves on tracks (compact shelving) was introduced to cut down on otherwise wasted aisle space.

[[File:ET Amhara asv2018-02 img120 Awra Amba.jpg|thumb|left|A community library in [[Ethiopia]].]]
[[Library 2.0]], a term coined in 2005, is the library's response to the challenge of Google and an attempt to meet the changing needs of users by using [[web 2.0]] technology. Some of the aspects of Library 2.0 include, commenting, tagging, bookmarking, discussions, use of online social networks by libraries, [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]], and [[Software widget|widgets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=L.B. |title=A Manifesto for our time |year=2007 |pages=47–9 |journal=American Libraries |volume=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by web 2.0, it is an attempt to make the library a more user-driven institution.

Despite the importance of public libraries, they are routinely having their budgets cut by state legislature. Funding has dwindled so badly that many public libraries have been forced to cut their hours and release employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jaeger |first=Paul T. |last2=Bertot |first2=John Carol |last3=Gorham |first3=Ursula |title=Wake Up the Nation: Public Libraries, Policy Making, and Political Discourse |journal=The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy |date=January 2013 |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=61–72 |doi=10.1086/668582 |jstor=10.1086/668582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reference libraries{{anchor|Reference library}}===
A reference library does not lend books and other items; instead, they must be read at the library itself. Typically, such libraries are used for research purposes, for example at a university. Some items at reference libraries may be historical and even unique. Many lending libraries contain a "reference section", which holds books, such as dictionaries, which are common reference books, and are therefore not lent out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Ehrenhaft |first2=William |last2=Howard Armstrong |first3=M.

===Research libraries{{anchor|Research library}}===
{{main|Research library}}

A research library is a collection of materials on one or more subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Young |first=Heartsill |title=ALA Glossary of Library and Information Science |year=1983 |page=188 |publisher=American Library Association |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-0-8389-0371-1 |oclc=8907224}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research library supports scholarly or scientific research and will generally include [[primary source|primary]] as well as [[secondary source]]s; it will maintain permanent collections and attempt to provide access to all necessary materials. A research library is most often an [[academic library|academic]] or [[national library]], but a large [[special library]] may have a research library within its special field, and a very few of the largest public libraries also serve as research libraries. A large university library may be considered a research library; and in North America, such libraries may belong to the [[Association of Research Libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arl.org/arl/membership/members.shtml |title=Association of Research Libraries (ARL) :: Member Libraries |website=arl.org |year=2012 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, they may be members of [[Research Libraries UK|Research Libraries UK (RLUK)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rluk.ac.uk/|title=RLUK: Research Libraries UK|publisher=RLUK|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research library can be either a reference library, which does not lend its holdings, or a lending library, which does lend all or some of its holdings. Some extremely large or traditional research libraries are entirely reference in this sense, lending none of their materials; most academic research libraries, at least in the US and the UK, now lend books, but not periodicals or other materials. Many research libraries are attached to a parental organization and serve only members of that organization.  Examples of research libraries include the [[British Library]], the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and the [[New York Public Library Main Branch]] on 42nd Street in Manhattan, [[State Public Scientific &amp; Technological Library|State Public Scientific Technological Library of the Sibirian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spsl.nsc.ru/en/|title=SPSTL SB RAS|website=www.spsl.nsc.ru|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl|title=Our Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital libraries===
{{main article|Digital library}}

Digital libraries are libraries that house digital resources. They are defined as an organization and not a service that provide access to digital works, have a preservation responsibility to provide future access to materials, and provides these items easily and affordably.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury &amp; Foo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital Libraries and Information Access: research perspectives|last1=Chowdhury|first1=G. G.|last2=Foo|first2=C.|date=2012|publisher=Neal-Schuman|year=|isbn=9781555709143|oclc=869282690|location=Chicago|pages=2–3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of a digital library implies that "a digital library uses a variety of software, networking technologies and standards to facilitate access to digital content and data to a designated user community."{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|pp=3–4}} Access to digital libraries can be influenced by several factors, either individually or together. The most common factors that influence access are: The library's content, the characteristics and information needs of the target users, the library's digital interface, the goals and objectives of the library's organizational structure, and the standards and regulations that govern library use.{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|p=49}} Access will depend on the users ability to discover and retrieve documents that interest them and that they require, which in turn is a preservation question. Digital objects cannot be preserved passively, they must be curated by digital librarians to ensure the trust and integrity of the digital objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scholarship in the digital age: information, infrastructure, and the Internet|last=Borgman|first=Christine L.|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262026192|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=88|oclc=181028448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest considerations for digital librarians is the need to provide long-term access to their resources; to do this, there are two issues requiring watchfulness: Media failure and format obsolescence. With media failure, a particular digital item is unusable because of some sort of error or problem. A scratched CD-Rom, for example, will not display its contents correctly, but another, unscratched disk will not have that problem. Format obsolescence is when a digital format has been superseded by newer technology, and so items in the old format are unreadable and unusable. Dealing with media failure is a reactive process, because something is done only when a problem presents itself. In contrast, format obsolescence is preparatory, because changes are anticipated and solutions are sought before there is a problem.{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|p=211}}

Future trends in digital preservation include: Transparent enterprise models for digital preservation, launch of self-preserving objects, increased flexibility in digital preservation architectures, clearly-defined metrics for comparing preservation tools, and terminology and standards interoperability in real time.{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|p=211}}

===Special libraries===
{{Main|Special library}}All other libraries fall into the "[[special library]]" category. Many private businesses and public organizations, including hospitals, churches, museums, research laboratories, law firms, and many government departments and agencies, maintain their own libraries for the use of their employees in doing specialized research related to their work. Depending on the particular institution, special libraries may or may not be accessible to the general public or elements thereof. In more specialized institutions such as law firms and research laboratories, librarians employed in special libraries are commonly specialists in the institution's field rather than generally trained librarians, and often are not required to have advanced degrees in specifically library-related field due to the specialized content and clientele of the library.

Special libraries can also include women's libraries or LGBTQ libraries, which serve the needs of women and the LGBTQ community. [[Libraries and the LGBTQ community]] have an extensive history, and there are currently many libraries, archives, and special collections devoted to preserving and helping the LGBTQ community. Women's libraries, such as the Vancouver Women's Library or the [[Women's Library]] @LSE are examples of women's libraries that offer services to women and girls and focus on women's history.

Some special libraries, such as governmental law libraries, hospital libraries, and military base libraries commonly are open to public visitors to the institution in question. Depending on the particular library and the clientele it serves, special libraries may offer services similar to research, reference, public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of a military collection. Given the highly individual nature of special libraries, visitors to a special library are often advised to check what services and restrictions apply at that particular library.

Special libraries are distinguished from [[special collections]], which are branches or parts of a library intended for rare books, manuscripts, and other special materials, though some special libraries have special collections of their own, typically related to the library's specialized subject area.

For more information on specific types of special libraries, see [[law library|law libraries]], [[medical library|medical libraries]], [[music library|music libraries]], or [[transportation libraries]].

==Organization==
[[File:HK Wan Chai Library Inside Bookcase a.jpg|thumb|Library shelves in Hong Kong, showing numbers of the classification scheme to help readers locate works in that section]]

Most libraries have materials arranged in a specified order according to a [[library classification]] system, so that items may be located quickly and collections may be browsed efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Library classification|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/library-classification|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some libraries have additional galleries beyond the public ones, where reference materials are stored. These reference stacks may be open to selected members of the public. Others require patrons to submit a "stack request", which is a request for an assistant to retrieve the material from the closed stacks: see [[List of closed stack libraries]] (in progress).

Larger libraries are often divided into departments staffed by both paraprofessionals and professional [[librarian]]s.
* Circulation (or Access Services) – Handles user accounts and the loaning/returning and shelving of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, V. &amp; Bullard, J. (2009). Circulation Services. In ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences'' (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Collection development|Collection Development]] – Orders materials and maintains materials budgets.
* Reference – Staffs a [[reference desk]] answering questions from users (using structured [[reference interview]]s), instructing users, and developing library programming. Reference may be further broken down by user groups or materials; common collections are [[children's literature]], [[Young adult fiction|young adult literature]], and [[genealogy]] materials.
* Technical Services – Works behind the scenes cataloging and processing new materials and deaccessioning [[Weeding (library)|weeded materials]].
* Stacks Maintenance – Re-shelves materials that have been returned to the library after patron use and shelves materials that have been processed by Technical Services. Stacks Maintenance also shelf reads the material in the stacks to ensure that it is in the correct library classification order.

[[File:Library card.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Browne Issue System|Card]] used by a user to sign out a book]]

Basic tasks in [[library management]] include the planning of acquisitions (which materials the library should acquire, by purchase or otherwise), library classification of acquired materials, preservation of materials (especially rare and fragile archival materials such as manuscripts), the deaccessioning of materials, patron borrowing of materials, and developing and administering library computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Library and information center management|last1=Stueart |first1=Robert |last2=Moran |first2=Barbara B. |last3=Morner |first3=Claudia J.|isbn=9781598849882|edition=Eighth|location=Santa Barbara, California|oclc=780481202 |year=2013 |publisher= Libraries Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt; More long-term issues include the planning of the construction of new libraries or extensions to existing ones, and the development and implementation of outreach services and reading-enhancement services (such as adult literacy and children's programming). Library materials like books, magazines, periodicals, CDs, etc. are managed by Dewey Decimal Classification Theory and modified Dewey Decimal Classification Theory is more practical reliable system for library materials management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhattacharjee|first1=Pijush Kanti|title=Modified Dewey Decimal Classification Theory for Library Materials Management|journal=International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology|date=2010|volume=1|issue=3|pages=292–294| url=http://www.ijimt.org/list-24-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has published several standards regarding the management of libraries through its Technical Committee 46 (TC 46),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=48750 |title=ISO – Technical committees – TC 46 – Information and documentation |publisher=ISO.org |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is focused on "libraries, documentation and information centers, publishing, archives, records management, museum documentation, indexing and abstracting services, and information science". The following is a partial list of some of them:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=48750 |title=ISO – ISO Standards – TC 46 – Information and documentation |publisher=ISO.org |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:India Education.jpg|right|thumb|[[National Library of India]], Kolkata, est. 1836]]
Librarians have sometimes complained&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Scott|date=Apr 2009|title=Libraries and Learning: A History of Paradigm Change|url=|journal=Portal : Libraries and the Academy|volume=9|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; that some of the library buildings which have been used to accommodate libraries have been inadequate for the demands made upon them. In general, this condition may have resulted from one or more of the following causes:
# an effort to erect a [[monument]]al building{{Vague|date=May 2012}}; most of those who commission library buildings are not librarians and their priorities may be different
# to conform it to a type of [[architecture]] unsuited to library purposes

Much advancement has undoubtedly been made toward cooperation between architect and librarian,{{when|date=September 2012}} and many good designers have made library buildings their speciality, nevertheless it seems that the ideal type of library is not yet realized—the type so adapted to its purpose that it would be immediately recognized as such, as is the case with school buildings at the present time.{{when|date=September 2012}} This does not mean that library constructions should conform rigidly to a fixed standard of appearance and arrangement, but it does mean that the exterior should express as nearly as possible the purpose and functions of the interior.&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Americana|last=Wiley |first=Edwin |wstitle=Library Architecture and Construction|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrons may not know how to fully use the library's resources. This can be due to some individuals' unease in approaching a staff member. Ways in which a library's content is displayed or accessed may have the most impact on use. An antiquated or clumsy search system, or staff unwilling or untrained to engage their patrons, will limit a library's usefulness. In the [[public library|public libraries]] of the United States, beginning in the 19th century, these problems drove the emergence of the [[library instruction]] movement, which advocated library user education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=S. C.|date=2003|title=The origin of library instruction in the United States, 1820–1900|journal=Research Strategies|volume=19|issue=3/4|pages=233–243|doi=10.1016/j.resstr.2004.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early leaders was [[John Cotton Dana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mattson|first=K.|date=2000|title=The librarian as secular minister to democracy: The life and ideas of John Cotton Dana|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture|volume=35|issue=4|pages=514–534|jstor=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic form of library instruction is sometimes known as [[information literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=T. E.|date=2006|title=Information literacy: Adapting to the media age|journal=Alki|volume=22|issue=1|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libraries should inform their users of what materials are available in their collections and how to access that information. Before the computer age, this was accomplished by the card [[library catalog|catalogue]]—a cabinet (or multiple cabinets) containing many drawers filled with [[index card]]s that identified books and other materials. In a large library, the card catalogue often filled a large room. The emergence of the [[Internet]], however, has led to the adoption of electronic catalogue databases (often referred to as "webcats" or as [[online public access catalog]]ues, OPACs), which allow users to search the library's holdings from any location with Internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sloan|first=B|last2=White|first2=M. S. B.|date=1992|title=Online public access catalogs|journal=Academic and Library Computing|volume=9|issue=2|pages=9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of catalogue maintenance is compatible with new types of libraries, such as [[digital library|digital libraries]] and [[distributed library|distributed libraries]], as well as older libraries that have been [[retrofitting|retrofitted]]. Electronic catalogue databases are criticized by some who believe that the old card catalogue system was both easier to navigate and allowed retention of information, by writing directly on the cards, that is lost in the electronic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mamis |first=Joshua |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/life_death_of_the_card_catalog/ |newspaper=New Haven Independent |title=Dewey Decimal didn't die |date=25 November 2011 |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is analogous to the debate over paper books and [[e-book]]s. While libraries have been accused of precipitously throwing out valuable information in card catalogues, most modern ones have nonetheless made the move to electronic catalogue databases. Large libraries may be scattered within multiple buildings across a town, each having multiple floors, with multiple rooms housing the resources across a series of shelves. Once a user has located a resource within the catalogue, they must then use navigational guidance to retrieve the resource physically; a process that may be assisted through signage, maps, GPS systems, or RFID tagging.

[[Finland]] has the highest number of registered book borrowers per capita in the world. Over half of Finland's population are registered borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pantzar |first=Katja |url=http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160064&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US |title=The humble Number One: Finland |publisher=This is Finland |date=September 2010 |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, public library users have borrowed on average roughly 15 books per user per year from 1856 to 1978. From 1978 to 2004, book circulation per user declined approximately 50%. The growth of audiovisuals circulation, estimated at 25% of total circulation in 2004, accounts for about half of this decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galbithink.org/libraries/circulation.htm Statistics on Book Circulation Per User of U.S. Public Libraries Since 1856&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from galbithink.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, there has been increasing use of the Internet to gather and retrieve data. The shift to digital libraries has greatly impacted the way people use physical libraries. Between 2002 and 2004, the average American academic library saw the overall number of transactions decline approximately 2.2%.&lt;ref&gt;Applegate, Rachel. "Whose Decline? Which Academic Libraries are "Deserted" in Terms of Reference Transactions?" ''Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly''; 2nd ser. 48 (2008): 176–89. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries are trying to keep up with the digital world and the new generation of students that are used to having information just one click away. For example, the University of California Library System saw a 54% decline in circulation between 1991 and 2001 of 8,377,000 books to 3,832,000.&lt;ref&gt;University of California Library Statistics 1990–91, University-wide Library Planning, University of California Office of the President (July 1991): 12; University of California Library Statistics July 2001, 7, [http://www.slp.ucop.edu/stats/00-01.pdf Ucop.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702182256/http://www.slp.ucop.edu/stats/00-01.pdf |date= 2 July 2010 }}.

These facts might be a consequence of the increased availability of e-resources. In 1999–2000, 105 ARL university libraries spent almost $100&amp;nbsp;million on electronic resources, which is an increase of nearly $23&amp;nbsp;million from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arl.org/newsltr/219/eresources.html "ARL Libraries Spend Nearly $100 Million on Electronic Resources," ''ARL Bimonthly Report 219'', Association of Research Libraries (December 2001)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521154449/http://www.arl.org/newsltr/219/eresources.html |date=21 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 report by the Open E-book Forum found that close to a million e-books had been sold in 2002, generating nearly $8&amp;nbsp;million in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Striphas, Ted. ''The Late Age of Print: Everyday Book Culture From Consumerism to Control''. New York City: [[Columbia University Press]], 2009.

One claim to why there is a decrease in the usage of libraries stems from the observation of the research habits of undergraduate students enrolled in colleges and universities. There have been claims that college undergraduates have become more used to retrieving information from the Internet than a traditional library. As each generation becomes more in tune with the Internet, their desire to retrieve information as quickly and easily as possible has increased. Finding information by simply searching the Internet could be much easier and faster than reading an entire book. In a survey conducted by NetLibrary, 93% of undergraduate students claimed that finding information online makes more sense to them than going to the library. Also, 75% of students surveyed claimed that they did not have enough time to go to the library and that they liked the convenience of the Internet. While the retrieving information from the Internet may be efficient and time saving than visiting a traditional library, research has shown that undergraduates are most likely searching only .03% of the entire web.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, Denise A. "How and Why are Libraries Changing?" Digital Library Federation. Library Information Technology – Carnegie Mellon, 9 January 2001. Web. 29 November 2009. [http://www.diglib.org/use/whitepaper.htm Diglib.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The information that they are finding might be easy to retrieve and more readily available, but may not be as in depth as information from other resources such as the books available at a physical library.

In the mid-2000s, Swedish company Distec invented a library book vending machine known as the [[GoLibrary]], that offers library books to people where there is no branch, limited hours, or high traffic locations such as [[El Cerrito del Norte station|El Cerrito del Norte]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART station]] in [[California]].

A library may make use of the [[Internet]] in a number of ways, from creating their own [[library website]] to making the contents of its [[Online public access catalog|catalogues searchable online]].

[[Digitizing|Digitization]] of books, particularly those that are [[Out of print|out-of-print]], in projects such as [[Google Books]] provides resources for library and other online users.

[[Public library advocacy]] is support given to a [[public library]] for its financial and philosophical goals or needs. Most often this takes the form of monetary or material donations or campaigning to the institutions which oversee the library, sometimes by advocacy groups such as [[Friends of Libraries]] and community members. Originally, library advocacy was centered on the library itself, but current trends show libraries positioning themselves to demonstrate they provide "economic value to the community" in means that are not directly related to the checking out of books and other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Ellen G.  |date=2009|title=Hard Times = A New Brand of Advocacy|journal=Georgia Library Quarterly|volume= 46|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1269&amp;context=glq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two anime series, LINE OFFLINE and LINE TOWN, were produced in 2013, picturing the Line Friends as employees for the fictional Line Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jpninfo.com/31855|title=Love LINE Friends?

=== Line Offline ===
Line Offline is an animated series created by [[Shogakukan Productions]], based on [[salaryman]] characters working at "Line Corporation". All 114 episodes last about three minutes. The series was aired from January 8, 2013, to October 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/07/line-offline/|title=Messaging App Line’s Kawaii Characters Get Their Own Cartoon Series In Japan – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episodes of Line Offline are not connected to each other. The idea behind the series is to represent the ordinary life of company employees (in this case Line's employees, hence the name "Line Offline"), in which every small problem could lead to awkward and hilarious situations that require some effort in order to restore the [[status quo]].

Most characters from Line Offline are part of Line's universe (the characters who are shown in the animated series are also Line Friends, and can be seen by users in Line Messaging App and used as emoticons).

The '''Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors''' is the oldest surviving women's art group in Australia.

==History==

The Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors (MSWPS) began in 1902 as a monthly gathering of eight former students of [[Frederick McCubbin]] from the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School|National Gallery School]] which members called the ''Students' Art Club''. It is known that among these founders were Daisy Stone, Tina Gowdie, Annie Gates, Kate Allan, Ella Thorn, [[Henrietta Maria Gulliver]] and a Miss Stock (otherwise unidentified, who died in 1906).&lt;ref name=peers/&gt; In 1905 they added the indigenous word  "Woomballano" (meaning either 'everlasting beauty' or 'search for beauty') to identify their Art Club, changing its title to ''The Women's Art Club'' in 1913 then to the ''Melbourne Society of Women Painters'' in 1930. The present designation was adopted in 1954.&lt;ref name=peers&gt;{{Citation |author= Juliette Peers| title=More than just gumtrees: a personal, social and artistic history of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors |date=1993 | publisher=Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors in association with Dawn Revival Press | isbn=978-0-646-16033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of its early members were [[plein air]] painters and identified with the [[Heidelberg School]], which was regarded widely as a male group but which involved many women. The interest in the [[decorative arts]] at the opening of the twentieth century attracted other members who were significant craftspeople. By the 1920s, the Society was assimilating the generation of professional women artists emerging from the Melbourne National Gallery School, with significant women artists, representatives of both the [[Max Meldrum|Meldrum]] tonal school and [[modernism]], being invited to join. The Society was less overtly [[feminist]] than its counterpart ''[[The Sydney Society of Women Painters]]'' (later named ''[[Women’s Industrial Art Society]]'') which was founded in 1910 in reaction to the discrimination of male-dominated juries of art institutions and societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Gaze, Delia | author2=Mihajlovic, Maja | author3=Shrimpton, Leanda | title=Dictionary of women artists | publication-date=1997 | publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn | isbn=978-1-884964-21-3 | page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Second World War]] the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors’ opened volunteer headquarters at [[Grosvenor Chambers]] (9 [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]], Melbourne) where they made and sold handcrafts and art to raise money for the war effort.&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;{{Citation | author1=Taylor, Alex | author2=State Library of Victoria (Melbourne) | title=Perils of the studio : inside the artistic affairs of bohemian Melbourne | publication-date=2007 | publisher=Australian Scholarly Publishing | isbn=978-1-74097-149-2 | page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSWPS has met at heritage-listed [[Ola Cohn|Ola Cohn House]] 41-43 Gipps Street, East Melbourne since the sculptor's death in 1964. She was President of the Society from 1948 to 1964.

'''The Rebecca and John J. Moores School of Music''' is the music school of  the [[University of Houston]]. The Moores School offers the [[Bachelor of Music]], [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Music, [[Master of Music]], and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees in music [[performance]], [[conducting]], [[music theory|theory]] and [[musical composition|composition]], [[music history]] and literature, [[pedagogy]], and [[music education]] and also offers a Certificate of Music Performance.  It is a component of the University of Houston [[University of Houston College of the Arts|College of the Arts (CotA)]].  The Moores School is a fully accredited member of the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] (NASM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasm.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=List_Accredited_Members&amp;memberId=397d2525bc7d131fba32569bd40fa3bc NASM Accredited Institutional Members - University of Houston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085913/http://nasm.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=List_Accredited_Members&amp;memberId=397d2525bc7d131fba32569bd40fa3bc |date=2014-04-07 }}.

==History==
[[Image:Moores School of Music.jpg|thumb|The Rebecca and John J. Moores School of Music]]
The University of Houston was founded in 1927, and the music department was formed in 1940.  In 1969 the department was officially designated as the University of Houston School of Music.  In 1972&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonarchitecture.com/Building/2303/Fine_Arts_Building_(Houston).php Fine Arts Building (Houston)]. Retrieved 2008-07-24.&lt;/ref&gt; the School of Music moved into the Fine Arts Building, a facility it shared with the [[University of Houston School of Art|Department of Art]].  A multimillion-dollar gift in 1991 by UH alumni [[John Moores (baseball)|John and Rebecca Moores]] led to renaming of the school in their honor (media references to the "Moores School of Music" appear as early as fall 1995) and to the construction of the present facility, which began operation in 1997.

Artistic directors of the school have included Bruce Spencer King, Earl Moore, Robert Briggs, [[Milton Katims]], David Tomatz, David Ashley White, and Andrew Davis.

==Overview==
Enrollment in the Moores School stands at nearly 600 music majors, who are instructed by a faculty of 80.  Since 1997 the school has been located at the Rebecca and John J. Moores School of Music Building on the University of Houston campus.  A large and varied schedule of concerts and recitals featuring students, faculty, and guest performers serves the concertgoing public of Houston throughout the year.

[[musical ensemble|Ensembles]] at the Moores School include the Wind Ensemble (recipient of multiple Grammy nominations), the Moores School Symphony Orchestra, the Concert Chorale, AURA (a contemporary music ensemble), the Jazz Orchestra, the [[Spirit of Houston Cougar Marching Band]], the Symphonic Winds, the Concert Band, the Cougar Brass, the Choral Artists, the Chamber Singers, the Concert Women's Chorus, the [[Houston Symphony Orchestra|Houston Symphony]] Chorus, the University Men's Chorus, the University Women's Chorus, the Moores School Percussion Ensemble, and Collegium Musicum (early music).  The Edythe Bates Old Moores Opera Center presents productions consistently lauded as being of professional quality.  As a component of the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Arts, the Moores School also collaborates for some events, programs, and productions with the [[University of Houston School of Art|School of Art]], the [[University of Houston Creative Writing Program|Creative Writing Program]], the School of Theatre and Dance, and the [[Blaffer Gallery]], the art museum of the University of Houston.

The Houston Opera Studio has provided dozens of world-class [[opera]] singers with early professional training and experience.  From its inception in 1977 until 1992, the Studio was a partnership between the University of Houston School of Music and [[Houston Grand Opera]]; it is now administered solely by HGO.&lt;ref&gt;"UH will end its support of Opera Studio" by Charles Ward. ''Houston Chronicle'', 18 February 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moores School of Music Percussion Ensemble, under the direction of Dr. Blake Wilkins, has also performed at three Percussive Arts Society International Conventions.  These showcase concerts were the result of winning three PAS "Call for Tapes" contests.  The Moores School Percussion Ensemble is the second ensemble in history to achieve three PAS Showcase concerts.  The group has recorded three commercially released compact discs:  Surge, released in 2005; Not Here, But There, released in 2009; and the most recent, Everywhere Entangled, which was released in January 2012.

Data indicate that some 80 percent of Moores School graduates stay in the Houston area following graduation, so that a large proportion of the community's professional musical performers and educators are University of Houston alumni.  Nevertheless, Moores School graduates in significant numbers can be found on concert stages, on college faculties, and in other leading professional musical roles worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Extracurricular programs and activities==
The Moores School hosts a number of musical activities outside the scope of its basic program of university instruction.  These include the following:
* a Division of Preparatory and Continuing Studies, which offers throughout the academic year private and classroom music instruction to the community at large, especially geared to children and adults
* the Texas Music Festival, an annual month-long summer program of concerts with intensive instruction and coaching for young professionals and highly talented students
* the Cougar Band Camp, a week-long summer program
* the International Piano Festival, an annual weekend of concerts and master classes with world-renowned keyboard artists
* an annual Moores School of Music Jazz Festival
* Floot Fire, an annual five-day festival for flutists

In addition, the Moores School of Music is home to chapters of four collegiate music fraternities and one honor society:
* The Beta Sigma chapter of [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], honorary band fraternity, founded January 21, 1950
* The Tau chapter of [[Tau Beta Sigma]], honorary band sorority, founded March 25, 1950.
* The Beta Pi chapter of [[Sigma Alpha Iota]], music fraternity, chartered March 28, 1953.
* The Omicron Upsilon chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] fraternity, chartered May 29, 1966.
* The Zeta Tau chapter of [[Pi Kappa Lambda]], music honor society, chartered 1989.

==Facilities==
[[Image:Moores Opera House.jpg|thumb|Moores Opera House]]
Located in the Arts District of the University of Houston campus, the centerpiece of the $24 million Rebecca and John J. Moores School of Music Building is the 800-seat Moores Opera House, which features a ceiling mural by [[Frank Stella]], light fixtures by [http://www.isaacmaxwell.com/ Isaac Maxwell], and a [[green room]] displaying paintings by [[Ary Stillman]].  The building contains 50 teaching studios and 60 practice rooms, a large library, state-of-the-art listening and composition facilities, a recording studio, four rehearsal halls for large ensembles, and a lounge.  Some facilities in the "old" Fine Arts Building, such as the Dudley Recital Hall and the Organ Hall, are still used by the Moores School.

[[File:Gran Mezquita de Isfahán, Isfahán, Irán, 2016-09-20, DD 64.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Decorative muqarnas vaulting in the [[iwan]] entrance to the [[Shah Mosque]] in [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]]]]

'''Muqarnas''' ({{lang-ar|مقرنص}}; {{lang-fa|مقرنس}}) is a form of ornamented [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] in [[Islamic architecture]], the "geometric subdivision of a [[squinch]], or [[cupola]], or [[corbel]], into a large number of miniature squinches, producing a sort of cellular structure", sometimes also called a "honeycomb" vault.&lt;ref name=virtual&gt;{{cite web |title=Armenian architecture glossary |url= http://www.virtualani.org/glossary/index.htm |author= VirtualAni website |accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for domes, and especially half-domes in entrances, [[iwan]]s and [[apse]]s, mostly in traditional [[Persian architecture|Persian]] architecture. Where some elements project downwards, the style may be called [[mocárabe]];&lt;ref name=virtual/&gt;&lt;ref name="Curl"&gt;{{cite book |last = Curl |first = James Stevens  |title = A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year = 2006 |type = Paperback |edition=   2nd |publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn = 0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are reminiscent of [[stalactite]]s, and are sometimes called "stalactite vaults".

The muqarnas developed from the squinch between the 10th and 11th centuries, in the region of Iran and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="Tabbaa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tabbaa |first1=Yasser |title=The Muqarnas Dome: Its Origin and Meaning |journal=Muqarnas |date=1985 |volume= 3 |pages= 61–74 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1523084 |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bloom |first1=Jonathan M. |title=The Introduction of the Muqarnas into Egypt |journal=Muqarnas |date=1988 |volume= 5 |pages= 21–28 |doi=10.2307/1523107 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1523107}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were typically grouped together to form "stalactite pendentives", to make the transition from square base to dome.&lt;ref name="Bloom"/&gt; The earliest examples come from fragments in Nishapur in Iran, and some of the earliest extant structures are: the Shrine of Imam al-Dawr in Iraq (1075-1090), the minaret of Badr al-Jamali's masshad in Cairo, dated by inscription to 1085, a cornice in Cairo's north wall (1085), the Great Mosque of Isfahan (1088), the Almoravid Qubba (1107-43) in Marrakech, the Great Mosque at Tlemcen in Algeria (1136), the Mosque of the Qarawiyyin in Morocco (rebuilt between 1135 and 1140), and the maristan of Nur al-Din in Damascus (1154).&lt;ref name="Tabbaa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom"/&gt; The largest number of muqarnas domes are to be found in Iraq and the Jazira region of eastern Syria, with a diverse variety of applications in domes, vaults, mihrabs, and niches.&lt;ref name="Tabbaa"/&gt; Other prominent examples of their development can be found across [[Morocco]] and by extension, the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], [[Spain]], the [[Abbasid]] palaces in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], and the mausoleum of Sultan [[Qaitbay]], [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Curl"/&gt; Large rectangular roofs in wood with muqarnas-style decoration adorn the 12th century [[Cappella Palatina]] in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], and other important buildings in [[Norman Sicily]]. Muqarnas is also found in [[Armenian architecture]].

==Structure==

Muqarnas is typically applied to the undersides of [[domes]], [[pendentive]]s, cornices, [[squinch]]es, arches and [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]].&lt;ref name="Curl"/&gt; Muqarnas cells are arranged in horizontal [[course (architecture)|courses]], as in a corbelled vault, with the horizontal joint surface having a different shape at each level.&lt;ref name=course&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muqarnas.muqarnas.org/muq-course/index.html|title=MUQARNAS ON-LINE COURSE|author=|date=|website=muqarnas.muqarnas.org|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=broug&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broug.com/learn_muqarnas.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151723/http://www.broug.com/learn_muqarnas.htm |archivedate=2015-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The edges of these surfaces can all be traced on a single [[plan view]]; architects can thus plan out muqarnas geometrically, as the image illustrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamabi.ac.jp/idd/shiro/muqarnas/default.htm|title=muqarnas|author=|date=|website=www.tamabi.ac.jp|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metta-physics.com/2011/05/islamic-art-geometry/|title=Metta-physics.com|author=|date=|website=www.metta-physics.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [http://muqarnas.muqarnas.org/muq-course/index.html these diagrams] for clarity.

Muqarnas do not in most applications have a significant structural role, remaining completely ornamental, but did have a structural role in the earliest forms of muqarnas domes in the Mesopotamian region, and decoration was not its primary purpose from its creation up until the building of the Alhambra.&lt;ref name="Tabbaa" /&gt; Muqarnas need not be carved into the structural blocks of a corbelled vault; it can be hung from a structural roof as a purely decorative surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/sharmiarchitect/muqarnas-mathematics-in-islamic|title=Muqarnas - Mathematics in Islamic Architecture|first=|last=sharmiarchitect|date=10 September 2013|website=slideshare.net|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=recon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/danowen777/muqarnas-reconceived-a-brief-survey#|title=Muqarnas مقرنس Reconceived - A Brief Survey|first=|last=Dan Owen|date=16 January 2014|website=slideshare.net|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muqarnas may be made of brick, stone, [[stucco]], or wood, and clad with tiles or plaster.&lt;ref name="Curl"/&gt; The individual cells may be called alveoles.&lt;ref name=virtual/&gt;

Muqarnas is generally a downward-facing shape; that is, a vertical line can be traced from the floor to any point on a muqarnas surface. However, some muqarnas elements have been designed with upwards-facing cells.&lt;ref name=recon/&gt;

The '''North British Academy of Arts''' (1908 - 1924) was an art institution of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in northern [[England]].

==Overview==

The Academy, later known as the North British Academy of Arts, Science, Literature, and Music, was located in the Claremount Buildings on the western side of Barras Bridge on the corner with Eldon Place in Newcastle upon Tyne, which is now opposite the County Council Offices.&lt;ref name="YearBook"/&gt;  Its objectives were initially "for the advancement of art, the encouragement and advantages of its associates and members, and for the creation of local art patriotism and enthusiasm amongst cultured and influential classes of North Britain."&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=DOM19090109.2.90&amp;cl=search&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------10--1----2%22north+british+academy+of+arts+%22-- ''Dominion''], 9 January 1909, page 11e.&lt;/ref&gt;  They soon evolved to encompass "the betterment of humanity by the advancement of art, literature, science, music, education, law, medicine, manufactures, commerce, agriculture, industries, and, engineering, to the end that the sum of human knowledge may be increased",&lt;ref name="pars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nzh"/&gt;   with the Society organized into ten sections, each presided over by a distinguished specialist.&lt;ref name="nzh"/&gt;  It was founded in 1908, incorporated in 1913, and dissolved in 1924. William James Morgan (1850-1923) was the secretary throughout the life of the Academy. At various times, [[Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland|Henry John Brinsley Manners]] (1852-1925), the 8th [[Duke of Rutland]], was its president.&lt;ref name="YearBook"&gt;''The Official Year-Book of the Scientific and Learned Societies of Great Britain and Ireland'', Charles Griffin &amp; Co. Ltd., London 1910-1924. &lt;br&gt;'''Note:''' The entry for 1924 includes the annotation "[No Return.]", and there is no entry for 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gazette1924"&gt;The ''London Gazette'' of 4 March 1924 [p1973a] advised that the North British Academy of Arts was voluntarily "wound up" on 5 February 1924 at an Extraordinary General Meeting of its shareholders held at 28 Bedford Row, London. Arthur Willey, accountant, of 50 North Parade, Whitley in Northamptonshire was appointed liquidator. A subsequent Extraordinary General Meeting of its shareholders confirmed these resolutions on 22 February 1924. Maisie Strobel was annotated as secretary of the Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''London Gazette'' of 29 April 1927 [p2826a] advised the registration (Reg. No. 5683 R. N'bld.) of the North British Academy of Arts had been cancelled by the Registrar of Friendly Societies as it had ceased to exist.&lt;/ref&gt; Early on the membership secretary was Frederick Huntley (1887-1960), and curator was William J. Macgarree. &lt;ref name="certificate"/&gt;

The "Entrance Fee" was two guineas, the "Annual Subscription", one guinea, and "Life Composition", twelve guineas. Annual Meetings were held in September, and exhibitions of members' works normally held twice a year. Members were described as fellows of the Academy, and entitled to append F.N.B.A. after their names.&lt;ref name="YearBook"/&gt;

==Exhibitions==

Eight exhibitions were held by the Academy before the [[Great War]].&lt;ref name="NAL"&gt;[http://catalogue.nal.vam.ac.uk/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1Y5P198854Y96.60789&amp;profile=nal&amp;uindex=NKW&amp;term=North%20British%20Academy%20of%20Arts.&amp;aspect=subtab114&amp;menu=search&amp;source=~!horizon#focus ''Catalogue of the National Art Library'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A gold medal and honorary fellowship was offered in 1909 to the first British aviator who flew a British-made machine between Newcastle and London to encourage the fledgling British aviation industry.&lt;ref&gt;''More Encouragement for British Flyers'' in ''Flight - Official Organ of the Aero Club of the United Kingdom'', 11 September 1909, page 560.&lt;/ref&gt;

A gardening competition was established in 1910 to foster a love of nature and beauty amongst school children, so that the homes of the poor might be beautified and the young provided with an innocent and interesting hobby. Initially there were 2,761 child gardeners at work in the slums of Newcastle upon Tyne, competing for prizes to a total of 50 guineas with the Academy providing the seeds. Their window boxes and flower pots were to be exhibited and judged in one of the school halls of the city in September of the following year. It was intended to extend the competition to London and other cities and towns of the United Kingdom, with school principals in North Britain being asked to encourage their charges to enter the competition.&lt;ref&gt;''Children and Flower Culture'' in ''The Limerick Chronicle'', 16 June 1910, page 2e.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarships were provided for talented poor students in the arts, music, painting, literature, etc.&lt;ref name="nzh"/&gt;

The '''Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti''', "New Academy of Fine Arts", also known as '''NABA''', is a privately run university in [[Milan]], [[Lombardy]], Italy. It has approximately 3000 students,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naba.it/why-choose-naba/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom are from abroad; it participates in the [[Erasmus Programme]].

==History==

NABA was founded in Milan in 1980.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1994 the Nuova Accademia received one of the forty "Ambrogino" certificates of civic merit awarded each year by the [[Comune]] of Milan.&lt;ref name=ambrogio&gt;[http://www.comune.milano.it/dseserver/ambrogini/attach/elenco%20CIVICHE%20BENEMERENZE_storiche.pdf Benemerenze Civiche (elenco aggiornato all'anno 2011)] (in Italian). Accessed May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 NABA also began hosting a “node”, or center linked to the [[University of Plymouth]]’s Planetary-Collegium research platform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/273 Planetary-Collegium]&lt;/ref&gt; offering various PhD programs in the arts and technology.

NABA was bought by Bastogi Spa of Milan in 2002. In December 2009 Bastogi sold it to [[Laureate Education]] of [[Baltimore]], Maryland, for €22 million.&lt;ref name=bastogi&gt;[http://www.bastogi.com/it/storia/ Storia]. Bastogi Spa. (in Italian) "History".

An '''Oil sketch''' or '''oil study''' is an artwork made primarily in [[oil paint]] in preparation for a larger, finished work. Originally these were created as preparatory studies or '''[[modello|modelli]]''', especially so as to gain approval for the design of a larger commissioned painting. They were also used as designs for specialists in other media, such as [[printmaking]] or [[tapestry]], to follow. Later they were produced as independent works, often with no thought of being expanded into a full-size painting.

The [[sketch (drawing)|usual medium]] for ''modelli'' was the [[drawing]], but an oil sketch, even if done in a limited range of colours, could better suggest the tone of the projected work. It is also possible to more fully convey the flow and energy of a composition in paint. For a painter with exceptional technique, the production of an oil sketch may be as rapid as that of a drawing, and many practitioners had superb brush skills. In its rapidity of execution the oil sketch may be used not only to express movement and transient effects of light and color, its gestural nature may even represent a mimetic parallel to the action of the subject.

One of the earliest artists to produce oil sketches was [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]], a fine draftsman and pupil of [[Raphael]], but not one who had passed through the traditional Florentine training, with its emphasis on drawing.  His are all apparently related to works later done on a larger scale, and are themselves relatively large and on [[panel painting|panel]], with examples in the [[National Gallery, London]][https://web.archive.org/web/20070303121519/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6594] and [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] being 75 and 65&amp;nbsp;cm tall respectively.  Sometimes a number of sketches for the same composition have survived.

In the early 17th century the oil sketch became widely used, as it was suited to conveying the drama of [[Baroque painting|Baroque art]].  [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] made great use of them, as working studies, and as ''modelli'' for clients, his own assistants, engravers and tapestry-makers.  Their degree of finish varies accordingly.  Rubens' working practices influenced others, such as [[Anthony van Dyck]], who did not normally use oil sketches for the portraits that were the bulk of his output, but did for his [[old master print|print]] series the ''Iconographie'', and for other works such as a projected series of tapestries and some religious paintings. The ''[[Magistrate of Brussels]]'', recognised in England in 2013, may be a Van Dyck portrait oil sketch. 

Perhaps the first to produce oil sketches as independent works was [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], an amazingly fecund generator of compositions on a relatively small range of subjects.  He grew up and trained in [[Genoa]], and apparently had contact with both Rubens and Van Dyck during their stays there.  He produced a large number of small works, mostly on paper, in a mixture of mediums - drawings or [[gouache]]s finished in oil, oils with pen details - in fact, most possible permutations.  Detail is typically restricted to a few key points, with much of the subject conveyed in impressionistic fashion.  By this time a collectors' market for studies in drawing was well developed, and there was appreciation of their energy and freedom. Castiglione's sketches to some extent seem to trade off this appreciation, and look more unfinished and offhand than they actually are - a concept with a great future. 

A systematic producer of small ''modelli'' sketches on canvas with a high degree of finish was the 18th century [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], whose superb technique is often shown at its best in reducing a huge [[altarpiece]] to a lively but precise rendering at this small scale. At roughly the same time [[Jean Fragonard]] was producing a series of virtuosic ''Figures de fantaisie'', half-length portraits of imaginary subjects, purporting to have been painted in an hour.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, Richard R.: ''Impression: Painting Quickly in France'', pages 31–2. Yale University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:John Constable 025.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[John Constable]], 1827, 22 × 31 cm]]

By the 19th century oil sketches, often referred to as "oil studies" if from this period, had become very common, both as preparatory works, and for their own sake. The popularity of the oil sketch engendered the need to formulate distinctions. The ''esquisse'', or oil sketch, tended to be inspirational or imaginative, often originating in literature or art; the ''etude'', or study, tended to represent an observation of nature, painted from life. In academic painting the oil sketch took the form of the ''croquis'', a small and gestural compositional study, and the ''ébauche'', a dynamic laying-in of paint on the full-scale canvas, a temporary stage of the painting eventually leading to greater elaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, pages 31–9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John Constable]] made extensive use of sketches for his landscapes, both of intimate scale, often in a [[sketchbook]] on paper, and in full-scale sketches for his largest "six-footers", which he used to refine his compositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/constable/ Tate Britain exhibition showing Constable's large landscapes along with their full-size oil sketches]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Composition study for the portrait of professor gross thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Eakins]], Sketch for [[The Gross Clinic]].]][[image:Study for swimming thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|left|Thomas Eakins, 1884 ''Swimming Hole sketch'', [[oil paint|oil]] on [[fiberboard]] mounted on fiberboard, 22.1 × 27 cm., 8{{fraction|3|4}} × 10{{fraction|3|4}} inches, [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], [[Washington, D.C..]]]][[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Géricault]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and [[Degas]] are other artists who often used them. For some oil sketches Degas painted in ''essence'', a technique by which the oil had been all but removed from the pigment, so that the artist was virtually drawing with pure paint. [[Seurat]] made many careful small oil sketches for his larger works. However, with the advent of [[Impressionism]], and then [[Modernism]], the practice of preparatory drawing and painting tended to decline. The abandonment by many artists of a high level of detail and finish in favor of a more [[painterly]] and spontaneous approach, reduced the distinction between a detailed sketch and a finished painting.  Sketches by Rubens or Tiepolo, for example, are at least as highly finished as many 20th century oil paintings.  Many artists, especially those working in more traditional styles, still use oil sketches today.  [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] is an example of an artist who called many of his most important, and largest, finished works "studies": examples are his [[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion]] [[Tate Britain]], or his ''Study from Pope Innocent X'', auctioned in 2007 for $52.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0516/baconf.html RTE story &amp; picture]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The One Million Masterpiece''' (abbreviated OMM) is the largest artistic collaboration ever attempted. It is an ongoing project to produce a true piece of global artwork.  As of October 16, 2007, 26,582 artists from 174 countries have participated, with $19,348.57 raised for charities worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The original project website was launched on July 14, 2006 by London-based artist Paul Fisher.  The site uses an Adobe Flash drawing tool to enable members to contribute images drawn on screen using a mouse or digipad, and an AJAX viewer which displays the whole artwork mosaic.

The website has developed and further [[social networking]] elements have been added.  Artists can rate one another's contributions, communicate via messages and maintain a profile page.

==Participation==
Participation is free to anyone with access to the internet.  Participants are each given a square where they can use a built-in drawing tool to create an image.  (These individual images combined are what will make up the final project as a giant mosaic.)  The project is open to, and intended for, all willing participants.  One need not be artistically trained, in order to participate.

'''Celebrity Involvement'''

Celebrity contributors include [[Peaches Geldof]], electric violinist [[Linzi Stoppard]], playwright [[Tom Stoppard]], doctor and health commentator [[Miriam Stoppard]], [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] frontman and artist [[Holly Johnson]], cult comedy icon [[Karl Pilkington]], businessman and socialite Sebastien Sainsbury and [[Supremes]] band member [[Susaye Greene]].

==Aims==
'''Artistic and Charitable'''

The One Million Masterpiece aims to produce a piece of public artwork that will provide a snapshot of global society.  It is intended that the final artwork be completed for unveiling on [[World Population Day]] 2008 and hopes to raise over $1 million for the projects charity partners [[Save the Children]], [[Oxfam]], [[ActionAid]] and [[World Cancer Research Fund]].  {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

'''World Record'''

The artwork also officially qualifies as a new world record.  The previous official record for the most artists completing a single picture was held by the painting A Little Dab of Texas, designed by Jim Campbell of [[Brenham]], [[Texas]], United States.  The picture was painted by 25,297 people and was completed in 3 years, 7 months on June 14, 1998.

==Recurring Elements Within Image (Space Monkeys)==

As the project is still underway, it is largely wondered whether the final image will have a thematic unity or if it will be a chaotic series of unrelated images.  Many recurring elements can be found throughout the work.  The most notable of these recurring elements are what have been dubbed "space monkeys."  Space monkeys are small circular faces, typically cartoonish in nature and rudimentary in style.  They are believed to have originated within Laura Dixon's picture—but they soon began to appear in pictures  throughout the project.

Other common recurring elements include:  views of the earth from space, eyes, hearts, and flowers.

==Video Replay of Drawing Process==
The OMM site's adobe drawing tool includes a feature that enables a video replay of the drawing process for each picture.  This feature has led several participants to not only create digital paintings, but also digital videos.  Angeli Arndt uses this feature in her artwork entitled "I'm Always Changing For You," to show a human face changing over time.  This video functionality adds a dimension to the project that is not noticeable when simply viewing still images of the project.

==Exhibition==
When completed The One Million Masterpiece will measure 80 metres in width and 31 meters in height and each individual contribution will be a 5&amp;nbsp;cm by 5&amp;nbsp;cm square. It is proposed that the final piece will be printed and unveiled in Central [[London]] on [[World Population Day]] 2008.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

==Controversy==
There has been controversy within the OMM community regarding content of individual artworks.  Some participants have complained that certain artworks are [[pornographic]] and/or [[obscene]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}  Occasionally, a participant will demand that the artwork of another participant be deleted.

'''Project Bandaloop''' brings to audiences performances of [[Aerial Dance|aerial dance]]. Under the direction of Amelia Rudolph, it creates a blend of dance, sport, ritual and environmental awareness. Inspired by the possibilities of climbing and rappelling, the choreography draws on aerial, vertical and horizontal movement to craft dances, many site-specific. The work explores the relationship between movement and gravity and stimulates viewers' awareness of their natural and built environments. The dancers, climbers and riggers have enjoyed bringing their form of aerial dance to new audiences and have performed for close to half a million people at major city landmarks and outdoor sites such as [[Yosemite Falls]], California, USA.

'''SMOG''' ({{lang-ru|СМОГ}}) was one of the earliest informal literary groups independent of the [[Soviet state]] in the post-Stalin [[Soviet Union]]. Among the several interpretations of the acronym are ''Smelsot', Mysl', Obraz i Glubina'' (Courage, Thought, Image and Depth), and, humorously, ''Samoe Molodoe Obshchestvo Geniev'' (Society of Youngest Geniuses).&lt;ref&gt;Or: ''Szhatyj Mig Otrazhennoi Giperboly'' (Condensed Moment of Reflected Hyperbole). 'Smog' is also a past tense of the verb 'to be able to', yielding 'I was able to', or 'I did it'. {{Cite book| publisher = Modern Humanities Research Association| isbn = 978-1-907322-52-5| last = Kravchenko| first = E.

It was organized in January/February 1965 by a group of young poets and writers: Poet Leonid Gubanov (initiator, membership card #1), writer and editor Vladimir Batshev (membership card #2), poet and publicist [[Yuri Kublanovsky]], Vladimir Aleynikov, a poet who received the Andrei Belyi prize; and poets Nikolai Bokov, Arkady Pakhomov, later joined by several dozens of others.&lt;ref&gt;Диссиденты о диссидентстве. «Знамя». — М., 1997, № 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Виктория Андреева , [http://www.port-folio.org/2006/part122.htm SMOG]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Сенкевич А.

The group carried out public reading of poetry and issued several ''[[samizdat]]'' collections and a magazine ''Sfinksy'' ("Sphynxes"). In 1965, they revived the literary meetings at Mayakovsky Square ([[Mayakovsky Square poetry readings]]).&lt;ref name=sundaram-stone&gt;{{Cite journal| issue = 16| last = Sundaram| first = Chantal| title = "The stone skin of the monument": Mayakovsky, Dissent and Popular Culture in the Soviet Union|url=http://sites.utoronto.ca/tsq/16/sundaram16.shtml |journal = Toronto Slavic Quarterly| date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the members also helped organize the unsanctioned [[Glasnost Meeting|1965 glasnost rally]] calling for a legal trial of writers Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel.&lt;ref name="daniel-roginsky"&gt;{{Cite book| editor = A.

'''''Saint Jerome Writing''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] master Michelangelo Merisi da [[Caravaggio]] in 1607 or 1608, housed in the Oratory of [[St John's Co-Cathedral]], [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]. It can be compared with Caravaggio's [[Saint Jerome Writing (Borghese) (Caravaggio)|earlier version]] of the same subject in the [[Borghese Gallery]] in [[Rome]].

Caravaggio arrived in Malta on 12 July 1607. He had spent the previous months in [[Naples]], where he had sought refuge with his powerful protectors the Colonna family after killing a man in a brawl in Rome the previous year. In Naples he had been an instant success, achieving ten commissions, including a number or large and very prestigious altarpieces, in less than a year, and inspiring a following of [[Caravaggisti]] among the city's artists. In short, in Naples he had found professional success, the esteem of fellow-artists, and the support of important patrons. Why then leave all this for a speck of rock inhabited by warrior-monks noted more for their fighting ([[Peter Robb (author)|Peter Robb]] compares them to the French Foreign Legion) than for their support of the arts? The following summarises the speculation of recent biographers such as Robb and Helen Langdon: In 1607 Caravaggio was still an outlaw, at risk of being tracked down by his enemies - the family of the man he had killed - and Naples, close to Rome, may have seemed comparatively exposed. His patrons and protectors - the Colonna, the Giustiniani, the banker Ottavio Costa,  - had strong links with Malta and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights]], and it may have been felt that joining the Order would give Carvaggio immediate protection and aid in procuring a Papal pardon for his eventual return to Rome. The Grand Master of the Knights, [[Alof de Wignacourt]], was keen to enhance the prestige of his Order and his capital, and the prospect of having one of the leading artists in Rome and Naples as ''de facto'' court painter must have been an appealing one. And so Caravaggio went to Malta.

The coat of arms in the bottom right corner of the painting is that of Ippolito Malaspina, Prior of the Order of the Knights of Saint John (the Knights of Malta) in Naples. Malaspina was a relative by marriage of Caravaggio's patron Ottavio Costa, a friend of his other patrons the Giustiniani brothers, and a cousin of Giovanni Andrea Doria, Prince of Genoa, who two years before had sheltered the artist after an earlier flight from Rome. It's possible that he may have had himself represented as the saint. ''[[Saint Jerome]]'' was thus a very important painting for the artist.

The subject seems oddly unmartial for a commission by a man whose ''raison d'etre'' was to fight the Turks - [[Jerome|St Jerome]] was venerated as the translator of the Bible, which he is seen doing here. But Malaspina was not only a famous warrior, he was also a commissioner for the poor, orphans and widows, and the painting may have been intended to emphasise both this aspect of his work and also the asceticism of the Order.

Ippolito Malaspina arrived in Malta at the end of the Great Siege of 1565. He landed with the 'Grande Soccorso' and was present in the final onslought on the invading Ottoman forces. Therefore, this knight indeed witnessed the final stages of the Great Siege. He was also a relative, if not the brother or cousin, of Vespasianus Malaspina who died a martyr's death whilst courageously fighting the Ottoman soldiery in Fort Saint Elmo. A depiction of Vespasianus Malaspina is found within the Co-Cathedral of Saint John on the right hand side of a window just above the chapel dedicated to the Langue of Italy. Therefore, Ippolito must have reached the Island to aid his brethren however his relative, amongst others, died a Catholic martyrs death. Previously to his Maltese residence, Ippolito Malaspina was Admiral of the Papal Fleet. The Catholic martyrs are unfortunately not much remembered by the Maltese, however a collective remembrace day referred to as [[Victory Day (Malta)|Victory Day]] is celebrated on September 8, Feast dedicated to the Nativity of Our Lady, also known as Our Lady of Victory on the Islands.

The '''Shanghai School''' ({{zh|s=海上画派|p=Hǎishàng Huàpài}}) is a style of Chinese art present in the late 19th century and centered in [[Shanghai]]. Late 19th century China, or the last years of the [[Qing dynasty]] formed a tumultuous time in China's history. This period immediately followed the defeat of China in the [[First Opium War]] by the [[British Empire]] and opened several ports, such as Shanghai, to foreign trade. This period was further destabilized by the [[Taiping Rebellion]] and the unequal treaties signed with European imperial powers. Shanghai, as an open city, became a sort of Asian melting pot where the various European powers could freely express their influence on the city. In turn, this influence gave rise to a new middle class which supported a new style of art known as the Shanghai school. 

The three hundred years of Chinese art history prior to the advent of the Shanghai School was dominated by the [[Literati painting|Literati style]] exemplified in the paintings of [[Shen Zhou]] in the 16th century. The Shanghai style marked the first major departure from traditionalist Chinese painting by focusing less on the symbolism emphasized by the Literati style and more on the visual content of the painting itself. The inspiration for this new style of painting came from 17th century eccentrics shunned by the Chinese art community at large and 18th Century [[Yangzhou]] style painters. However, the Shanghai school was characterized by its even greater form exaggeration and brighter colors. The Shanghai School was unable to gain significant traction against the traditional painting style because of greater Western interest (and money) in the Literati tradition. 

Some important artists of the Shanghai School include [[Wu Changshuo]], [[Zhao Zhiqian]], [[Ren Bonian]],&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269181 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; [[He Tianjian]], [[Xie Zhiliu]], and [[Cheng Shifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artmuseumonline.org/zx/tszlcontent.jspx?type=0&amp;contentId=1505 |script-title=zh:名家艺术陈列专馆 |trans-title=Exhibition for noted painters |publisher=[[China Art Museum]] |language=Chinese |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stadttheater Meran''' is the civic [[theatre]] of the town of [[Meran]] in [[South Tyrol]], northern Italy.

With the economic and financial development of the city as a [[spa]] for [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]] and the aristocracy, the need for a higher cultural institution rose. The architect [[Martin Dülfer]], who was a representative of the Munich School of Architecture, was given the commission to build the new theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Klein, Martin Dülfer. ''Wegbereiter der deutschen Jugendstilarchitektur''. Arbeitshefte des Bayerischen Landesamtes für Denkmalpflege, 8. Lipp, Munich 1993. {{ISBN|3-87490-531-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He designed the theatre in the ''[[Jugendstil]]''. It was completed in 1899 and inaugurated on December 1, 1900.

After the annexation of the town following the end of [[World War I]] from Austria-Hungary to Italy was the theatre renamed by the Italians after [[Giacomo Puccini]], who visited the town in 1923. The theatre saw its decline after [[World War II]] and the 1950s. It was, however, revived again and renovated after a fire in 1978.

'''''The Passing of the Armies''''', full title '''''The Passing of the Armies; An Account of the Final Campaign of the Army of the Potomac, Based Upon Personal Reminiscences of the Fifth Army Corps'''''&lt;ref&gt;The full title of the book is ''The Passing of the Armies; An Account of the Final Campaign of the Army of the Potomac, Based Upon Personal Reminiscences of the Fifth Army Corps''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38664535].&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[American Civil War]] memoir written by [[Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain]], a renowned commander most famous for his actions on [[Little Round Top]] at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. It is an autobiographical account describing Chamberlain's experiences throughout the latter half of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], on and off the battlefield. It follows his accounts through [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]], [[Battle of White Oak Road|White Oak Road]], [[Battle of Five Forks|Five Forks]], and [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]] (where Chamberlain was given the honor of accepting the [[Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House#Surrender|Confederate surrender]]).  Throughout the book, Chamberlain frequently expresses his respect for the soldiers of both the [[Confederate States of America| Confederacy]] and the [[Union (American Civil War)| Union]]. It was published by [[Putnam and Sons]] in 1915, a year after Chamberlain's death.

==Appomattox==

Respect for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, a common theme in the book, was never expressed greater than at [[Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House#Surrender|the surrender at Appomattox]]. Chamberlain recalled the events: 

''"We Formed...to face the last line of battle, and receive the last remnant of the arms and colors of that great army which ours had been created to confront for all that death can do for life."''

Chamberlain goes on to recount how the withered remnants of the armies, formerly robust and strong at the beginning of the war, met each other. The remnants of [[John Bell Hood|Hood]]'s division at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] united with the [[III Corps (Union Army)|Union Third Corps]] exchanging mutual respect. He explains how [[Longstreet's corps]] could not be greeted properly after having exchanged volleys of fire and death with each other.

'''''The Potato Harvest''''' is a painting by the French artist [[Jean-François Millet]].

==History==
Jean-François Millet was raised in the area of France known as the old province of Normandy.  He was brought up with hard out-of-door labor.  After studying to become a painter, he devoted his art to illustrating peasants farming the land.  His subjects were often taken from his surroundings or from memories from his youth.&lt;ref name="Estelle"&gt;[Estelle, M.H., Jean Francois Millet, Tredition, 2011, pp. 1-2, {{ISBN|3842434642}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1850s, Millet began incorporating his subjects into landscapes.  The Potato Harvest is one of nine works which drew international acclaim at the Exposition Universelle in 1867.&lt;ref name="William Johnston"&gt;[Johnston, W.R., Nineteenth Century Art: From Romanticism to Art Nouveau, The Walters Art Gallery, p.56, {{ISBN|1857592433}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
''The Potato Harvest'' depicts peasants working in the plains between Barbizon and Chailly.  It presents a theme representative of the peasants' struggle for survival.  Millet's technique for this work incorporated paste-like pigments thickly applied over a coarsely textured canvas.&lt;ref name="William Johnston"/&gt;

==Off the Wall==
Currently, ''The Potato Harvest'' is being featured in ''Off the Wall'', an open-air exhibition on the streets of [[Baltimore]], Maryland.  A reproduction of the painting, the original is part of [[The Walters Art Museum]] collection, will be on display at Di Pasquales.&lt;ref name="Off the Wall"&gt;[http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ Walters Art Museum - Off the Wall] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119005400/http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ |date=2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Gallery in London began the concept of bringing art out of doors in 2007 and the Detroit Institute of Art introduced the concept in the U.S.. The ''Off the Wall'' reproductions of the Walters' paintings are done on weather-resistant vinyl and include a description of the painting and a QR code for smart phones.&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"&gt;[Smith, T., Walters Art Museum goes of the wall, The Baltimore Sun, September 11, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Teapot'''" ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Theepotten'') is a literary [[fairy tale]] by Danish [[poet]] and [[author]] [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a teapot and her adventures. The tale was first published 1863 and demonstrates the Andersen's talent for investing ordinary household objects with life, character, and personality.

== Plot summary ==
A porcelain teapot rules the tea table. She is very proud of her handle and spout, but not quite so proud of her lid (which is cracked). She is very proud of holding the tea leaves and of being the one to pour forth her contents for thirsty humankind. One day, the teapot is dropped and the handle and spout are broken. She is given to a beggar woman who fills her with soil and plants a flowering bulb within her. The teapot then feels a happiness she has never known. At the last, the teapot is broken in two, the bulb removed to a bigger pot, and the teapot thrown away. She cherishes her memories.

== Publication history==
[[Image:teapot Pedersen 01.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Lorenz Frølich]], an early illustrator of Andersen's works]]
The tale was first published December 1863 in ''Folkekalender for Danmark''. The work was republished 12 December 1871 in the fourth volume of ''Fairy Tales and Stories. 1871.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=160 |publisher=Hans Christian Andersen Center |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Teapot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toccata, Adagio, and Fugue in C major''' ([[BWV]] 564) is an [[organ (music)|organ]] composition by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. As is the case with most other organ works by Bach, the autograph score does not survive. The earliest manuscript copies were probably made in 1719&amp;ndash;1727. The title of the piece in these copies is given, as expected of organ literature of the time, simply as ''Toccata in C major'' (or more precisely, ''Toccata ped: ex C'' in one source and ''Toccata ex C{{Music|natural}} pedaliter'', referring to the obbligato pedal part).&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2003, 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is an early work, probably composed in the mid-to-late [[Weimar]] years, i.e. 1710&amp;ndash;1717. It shares some similarities with other toccatas composed around the same time, such as [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 538|BWV 538]], [[Toccata and Fugue in F major, BWV 540|BWV 540]], and others: all show the influence of [[concerto]] style and form.&lt;ref name="jones160"&gt;Jones 2007, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The work begins with an updated and extended form of the old prelude-type, manual ''passaggio'' followed by a pedal solo, and a motivic-contrapuntal section. Bach's extended ''passaggio'' which opens BWV 564 may have been inspired by [[Johann Heinrich Buttstett|Buttstett]]'s preludes; both the rhetorical rests followed by returns to the tonic and the single pedal notes are part of the older tradition as well.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2003, 151&amp;ndash;52.&lt;/ref&gt; The following pedal solo, however, is unique in organ literature: it is the longest known pedal introduction,&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2003, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; reaching far beyond the scope of Bach's models ([[Dieterich Buxtehude|Buxtehude]], [[Georg Böhm|Böhm]], and others) or his own earlier works (e.g. the pedal solo in BWV 549). The full-voiced section that follows elaborates on motives first introduced in the pedal solo. Various scholars have noted how the construction of this first [[Movement (music)|movement]] is reminiscent of that of a concerto, if the opening manual and pedal passages are taken as "solos" and the closing contrapuntal section as a "tutti".&lt;ref name="jones160" /&gt;

The second movement is again in two sections, one marked Adagio and another marked Grave. The insertion of a middle slow movement in an organ work was unusual for Bach, although traces of this idea can be found in other works from the same period: for example, a surviving early version of ''Prelude and Fugue in C Major'', BWV 545, contains a slow ''Trio'', which was removed from the final version, but found its way into one of the late organ trio sonatas, BWV 529.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Grove.&lt;/ref&gt; The Adagio is a melody made of short phrases, characteristic of early Bach, over what may be seen as a realized [[Figured bass|continuo]] part. The music has been compared to [[Giuseppe Torelli]]'s ''Concerto in C major'' Op. 8 No. 1; but in Bach's oeuvre, this Adagio stands alone and has no parallels. The abundance of [[Neapolitan sixth]]s and quasi-[[pizzicato]] pedal suggests Italian influence.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2003, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The Adagio flows seamlessly into the short Grave section, which, through italiante ''durezze'' chromatic progressions, enlarged with several instances of diminished seventh chords suspended over the next chord, leads back to the tonic.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2003, 153&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third movement is a four-voice fugue in [[time signature|6/8]]. It includes a [[countersubject]] typical of [[Fugue#Permutation fugue|permutation fugues]], which, unusually, engages in dialogue with the subject. Several features of the fugue suggest that it represented a considerable advance for Bach, especially considering that there are middle entries as far as the mediant and the dominant of the dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2003, 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat unusually for Bach, the fugue includes very few episodes, the longest being the coda of the piece, which is based on various [[style brisé]] figures. 

BWV 564 influenced a number of composers both during Bach's lifetime and after his death. Bach's pupil [[Johann Ludwig Krebs]] imitated the work in his ''Prelude and Fugue in C major'' (leaving out, however, the slow movement), while in the 20th century, [[Ferruccio Busoni]] published a transcription of BWV 564 for the piano (1900; one of many Bach transcriptions by the same author), and the work influenced Busoni's own ''Toccata for Piano'' (1920).

A '''Tour Accountant''' is responsible for the financial operations of a large scale [[concert tour]]. Normally, a Tour Accountant will report to both the [[Tour Manager]] (for all matters regarding tour financial operations), and to the Artist Manager/Business Manager (for overall financial reporting).

From a tour perspective, the Tour Accountant will normally: handle periodic financial transactions (either with Artist Management, or promoter), including per diem draw, wire transfers of both direct (Promoter &gt; Artist Management) and indirect (Promoter &gt; Tour Accountant &gt; Artist Management; usually box office receipts collected at settlement by Tour Accountant) funds, per diem distribution, hotel settlement, currency exchange (international tours), negotiate all local tax issues (concerning Artist earnings in each individual local market), and constantly work to clear up any "grey areas" during the advance, that have the potential to affect show settlement. Although normally, tour members will be paid by either Artist Management/Business Management, or accounting firm, the Tour Accountant will act as the "conduit" between the parties, while the tour is operating.

If a tour is not large enough to warrant utilizing a Tour Accountant, the [[Tour Manager]] will normally assume his/her responsibilities, as listed above. Generally, the only exception to this is if Artist Management travels with tour, and opts to handle the aforementioned.

The path to becoming a Tour Accountant usually involves either advancement through the ranks (a great deal of experience with a specific Artist, or Artist Management company), or via a more traditional route (secondary, post secondary education &amp; degree, followed by employment with either Artist Management company, or specialized Entertainment Accounting company).

'''Tragedy''' (from the {{lang-grc-gre|[[wiktionary:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]}}, ''tragōidia''{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | [[Middle English]] ''tragedie'' &lt; [[Middle French]] ''tragedie'' &lt; [[Latin]] ''tragoedia'' &lt; {{lang-grc|[[wiktionary:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]}}, ''tragōidia''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Tragedy | page = 1637 | first = E | last = Klein | title = A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language | volume = II L–Z | publisher = Elsevier | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;}})  is a form of [[drama]] based on human [[suffering]] that invokes an accompanying [[catharsis]] or pleasure in audiences.{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1999 | p = 21 | loc = §2 | ps =: ‘two-fold mood[…] the strange mixture and duality in the affects of the [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] [[Cult of Dionysus|enthusiasts]], that phenomenon whereby pain awakens pleasure while rejoicing wrings cries of agony from the breast.  From highest joy there comes a cry of horror or a yearning lament at some irredeemable loss.  In those Greek festivals there erupts what one might call a [[Sentimentality|sentimental]] tendency in nature, as if it had cause to sigh over its [[Sparagmos|dismemberment]] into [[Individuation|individuals]]’.}}  While many [[culture]]s have developed forms that provoke this [[paradox]]ical response, the term ''tragedy'' often refers to a specific [[Poetic tradition|tradition]] of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 14–16}}  That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of [[cultural identity]] and historical continuity—"the [[Classical Athens|Greeks]] and the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]], in one cultural form; [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenes]] and [[Christian]]s, in a common activity," as [[Raymond Williams]] puts it.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | p = 16}}

From its origins in the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] 2500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], as well as a large number of fragments from other poets; through its singular articulations in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Jean Racine]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]] to the more recent [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] tragedy of [[August Strindberg]]; [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Modernism|modernist]] meditations on death, loss and suffering; [[Heiner Müller|Müller's]] [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] reworkings of the tragic canon; and [[Joshua Oppenheimer]]'s incorporation of tragic pathos in his nonfiction film, ''[[The Act of Killing]]'' (2012), tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 13–84}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}  A long line of [[philosophers]]—which includes [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]],{{Sfn | Benjamin | 1998}} [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]]{{Sfn | Deleuze | Guattari | 1972}}—have analysed, speculated upon, and criticised the genre.{{Sfn | Felski | 2008 | p = 1}}{{Sfn | Dukore | 1974 | ps =: primary material.}}{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}

In the wake of Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make [[genre]] distinctions, whether at the scale of [[poetry]] in general (where the tragic divides against [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]). In the [[Modernity|modern]] era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, [[melodrama]], [[Tragicomedy|the tragicomic]], and [[epic theatre]].{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}{{Sfn | Pfister | 1977}}{{Sfn | Elam | 1980}}  [[Drama]], in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-[[Genre|generic]] [[deterritorialization|deterritorialisation]] from the [[Nineteenth century theatre|mid-19th century]] onwards. Both [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Augusto Boal]] define their [[epic theatre]] projects ([[non-Aristotelian drama]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], respectively) against models of tragedy. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation.{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}

== Origin ==
[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure]]
The word "tragedy" appears to have been used to describe different phenomena at different times. It derives from [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] {{lang |grc|τραγῳδία}}, [[sandhi|contracted]] from ''trag(o)-aoidiā'' = "[[goat]] [[Ode|song]]", which comes from ''tragos'' = "he-goat" and ''aeidein'' = "to sing" (''[[cf.]]'' "ode"). Scholars suspect this may be traced to a time when a goat was either the prize&lt;ref&gt;See [[Horace]], ''Epistulae'', II, 3, 220: "Carmino qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum".&lt;/ref&gt; in a competition of [[Greek dances|choral dancing]] or was that around which a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] danced prior to the animal's [[ritual]] [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}  In another view on the etymology, [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] (2nd–3rd century CE) says that the original form of the word was ''trygodia'' from ''trygos'' (grape harvest) and ''ode'' (song), because those events were first introduced during grape harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV1.p0071&amp;id=Literature.AthV1&amp;isize=M&amp;pview=hide%20 | first = Athenaeus | last = of Naucratis | title = The deipnosophists | publisher = Wisc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 335 BCE (long after the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]] of [[Classical Greece|5th-century]] [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] tragedy), [[Aristotle]] provides the earliest-surviving explanation for the origin of the [[drama]]tic [[The arts|art form]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', in which he argues that tragedy developed from the [[improvisation]]s of the leader of [[Greek chorus|choral]] [[dithyramb]]s ([[hymn]]s sung and danced in praise of [[Dionysos]], the god of wine and fertility):{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}
{{Quote |Anyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the phallic processions which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities), [tragedy] grew little by little, as [the poets] developed whatever [new part] of it had appeared; and, passing through many changes, tragedy came to a halt, since it had attained its own nature. | Poetics IV, 1449a 10–15{{Sfn | Janko | 1987 | p = 6}}}}

In the same work, Aristotle attempts to provide a scholastic definition of what tragedy is:
{{Quote |Tragedy is, then, an enactment of a deed that is important and complete, and of [a certain] magnitude, by means of language enriched [with ornaments], each used separately in the different parts [of the play]: it is enacted, not [merely] recited, and through pity and fear it effects relief ([[catharsis]]) to such [and similar] emotions. | Poetics, VI 1449b 2–3&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Aristotle, Poetics, section 1449b | publisher = Tufts | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is some dissent to the dithyrambic origins of tragedy, mostly based on the differences between the shapes of their choruses and styles of dancing.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}} A common descent from pre-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] fertility and burial rites has been suggested.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] discussed the origins of Greek tragedy in his early book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872). Here, he suggests the name originates in the use of a chorus of goat-like [[satyr]]s in the original [[dithyramb]]s from which the tragic genre developed.

Scott Scullion writes:  {{quote|There is abundant evidence for tragoidia understood as "song for the prize goat". The best-known evidence is Horace, Ars poetica 220-24 ("he who with a tragic song competed for a mere goat"); the earliest is the Parian Marble, a chronicle inscribed about 264/63 BCE, which records, under a date between 538 and 528 BCE: "Thespis is the poet ... first produced ... and as prize was established the billy goat" (FrGHist 239A, epoch 43); the clearest is Eustathius 1769.45: "They called those competing tragedians, clearly because of the song over the billy goat"...&lt;ref&gt;Scott Scullion: "Tragedy and Religion: The Problem of Origins", in Gregory (ed.), A Companion to Greek Tragedy, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdTuNrx6z4oC&amp;q=%22There+is+abundant+ancient+evidence%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22There%20is%20abundant%20ancient%20evidence%22&amp;f=false p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Athenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of [[dance]]-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.{{Sfn | Brown | 1998 | p = 441}}{{Sfn | Cartledge | 1997 | pages = 3–5}}{{Sfn | Goldhill | 1997 | p = 54}}{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 206}}{{Sfn | Styan | 2000 | p = 140}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | p = 104 | ps =: “most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct”.}}  Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 32–3}}{{Sfn | Brown | 1998 | p = 444}}{{Sfn | Cartledge | 1997 | pp = 3–5, 33 | ps =: [although [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] of the 4th century judged [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] "as the nonpareils of the [[genre]], and regularly honored their plays with revivals, tragedy itself was not merely a 5th-century phenomenon, the product of a short-lived [[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]].

Athenian tragedies were performed in late March/early April at an annual state religious festival in honor of Dionysus. The presentations took the form of a contest between three playwrights, who presented their works on three successive days. Each playwright offered a tetralogy consisting of three tragedies and a concluding comic piece called a [[satyr play]].{{sfn|Lucas|1954|p=7}} The four plays sometimes featured linked stories. Only one complete trilogy of tragedies has survived, the ''[[Oresteia]]'' of Aeschylus. The Greek theatre was in the open air, on the side of a hill, and performances of a trilogy and satyr play probably lasted most of the day. Performances were apparently open to all citizens, including women, but evidence is scant.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The theatre of Dionysus at Athens probably held around 12,000 people.{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 33–34}}

All of the choral parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an ''[[aulos]]'') and some of the actors' answers to the chorus were sung as well. The play as a whole was composed in various verse metres. All actors were male and wore masks. A [[Greek chorus]] danced as well as sang, though no one knows exactly what sorts of steps the chorus performed as it sang. Choral songs in tragedy are often divided into three sections: strophe ("turning, circling"), antistrophe ("counter-turning, counter-circling") and epode ("after-song").

Many ancient Greek tragedians employed the ''[[Ekkyklema|ekkyklêma]]'' as a theatrical device, which was a platform hidden behind the scene that could be rolled out to display the aftermath of some event which had happened out of sight of the audience. This event was frequently a brutal murder of some sort, an act of violence which could not be effectively portrayed visually, but an action of which the other characters must see the effects in order for it to have meaning and emotional resonance. A prime example of the use of the ''ekkyklêma'' is after the murder of [[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]] in the first play of Aeschylus' ''Oresteia'', when the king's butchered body is wheeled out in a grand display for all to see. Variations on the ''ekkyklêma'' are used in tragedies and other forms to this day, as writers still find it a useful and often powerful device for showing the consequences of extreme human actions. Another such device was a crane, the [[mechane]], which served to hoist a god or goddess on stage when they were supposed to arrive flying. This device gave origin to the phrase "[[deus ex machina]]" ("god out of a machine"), that is, the surprise intervention of an unforeseen external factor that changes the outcome of an event.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BCE) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BCE, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek tragedy]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 43}}  From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BCE-476 CE), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and even reached England.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 36, 47}}  While Greek tragedy continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BCE marks the beginning of regular [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 43}}{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].}}  [[Livius Andronicus]] began to write Roman tragedies, thus creating some of the first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 47}}  Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write tragedies (though he was more appreciated for his comedies).{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 47}}  No complete early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three other early tragic playwrights—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 49}}

From the time of the empire, the tragedies of two playwrights survive—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}  Nine of [[Senecan tragedy|Seneca's tragedies]] survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 49–50}}  Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}

Seneca's tragedies rework those of all three of the Athenian tragic playwrights whose work has survived. Probably meant to be recited at [[elite]] gatherings, they differ from the Greek versions in their long declamatory, narrative accounts of action, their obtrusive moralising, and their bombastic rhetoric. They dwell on detailed accounts of horrible deeds and contain long reflective [[soliloquies]]. Though the gods rarely appear in these plays, ghosts and witches abound. Senecan tragedies explore ideas of [[Revenge tragedy|revenge]], the occult, the supernatural, suicide, blood and gore. The Renaissance scholar [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] (1484–1558), who knew both Latin and Greek, preferred Seneca to Euripides.

===Influence of Greek and Roman===
Classical Greek drama was largely forgotten in Western Europe from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 16th century. [[Medieval theatre]] was dominated by [[mystery play]]s, [[morality play]]s, [[farce]]s and [[miracle play]]s. In Italy, the models for tragedy in the later Middle Ages were Roman, particularly the works of Seneca, interest in which was reawakened by the [[Padua]]n [[Lovato Lovati|Lovato de' Lovati]] (1241–1309).&lt;ref name=lovati&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lovato-de-lovati/ "Lovati, Lovato de'"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His pupil [[Albertino Mussato]] (1261–1329), also of Padua, in 1315 wrote the [[Latin verse]] tragedy ''Eccerinis'', which uses the story of the tyrant [[Ezzelino III da Romano]] to highlight the danger to Padua posed by [[Cangrande della Scala]] of [[Verona]].&lt;ref name=muss&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/albertino-mussato// "Mussato, Albertino"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first secular tragedy written since Roman times, and may be considered the first Italian tragedy identifiable as a Renaissance work. The earliest tragedies to employ purely classical themes are the ''Achilles'' written before 1390 by [[Antonio Loschi]] of [[Vicenza]] (c.1365–1441) and the ''Progne'' of the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Gregorio Correr]] (1409–1464) which dates from 1428–29.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;"Drama", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', eleventh edition, Vol. '''VIII''', p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1515 [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]] (1478–1550) of Vicenza wrote his tragedy ''Sophonisba'' in the [[vernacular]] that would later be called [[Italian language|Italian]]. Drawn from [[Livy]]'s account of [[Sophonisba]], the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] princess who drank poison to avoid being taken by the Romans, it adheres closely to classical rules. It was soon followed by the ''Oreste'' and ''Rosmunda'' of Trissino's friend, the Florentine [[Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai]] (1475–1525). Both were completed by early 1516 and are based on classical Greek models, ''Rosmunda'' on the ''[[Hecuba]]'' of [[Euripides]],  and ''Oreste'' on the ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' of the same author; like ''Sophonisba'', they are in Italian and in blank (unrhymed) [[hendecasyllable]]s. Another of the first of all modern tragedies is ''A Castro'', by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] poet and playwright [[António Ferreira]], written around 1550 (but only published in 1587) in polymetric verse (most of it being blank hendecasyllables), dealing with the murder of [[Inês de Castro]], one of the most dramatic episodes in Portuguese history.   Although these three Italian plays are often cited, separately or together, as being the first regular tragedies in modern times, as well as the earliest substantial works to be written in blank hendecasyllables, they were apparently preceded by two other works in the vernacular: ''Pamfila'' or ''Filostrato e Panfila'' written in 1498 or 1508 by [[Antonio Cammelli]] (Antonio da Pistoia); and a ''Sophonisba'' by [[Galeotto del Carretto]] of 1502.&lt;ref name=hallam&gt;Henry Hallam (1837) [https://books.google.com/books?id=M8JMAAAAcAAJ ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries''].

Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1500 printed copies, in the original languages, of the works of [[Sophocles]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and [[Euripides]], as well as comedic writers such as [[Aristophanes]], [[Terence]] and [[Plautus]], were available in Europe and the next forty years saw [[Humanism|humanists]] and poets translating and adapting their tragedies.  In the 1540s, the European university setting (and especially, from 1553 on, the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theatre (in Latin) written by scholars. The influence of Seneca was particularly strong in its humanist tragedy. His plays, with their ghosts, lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory, brought a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action to many humanist tragedies.

The most important sources for French tragic theatre in the Renaissance were the example of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and the precepts of [[Horace]] and [[Aristotle]] (and contemporary commentaries by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] and [[Lodovico Castelvetro]]), although plots were taken from classical authors such as [[Plutarch]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], etc., from the Bible, from contemporary events and from short story collections (Italian, French and Spanish).  The Greek tragic authors ([[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]) would become increasingly important as models by the middle of the 17th century. Important models were also supplied by the [[Spanish Golden Age]] playwrights [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Tirso de Molina]] and [[Lope de Vega]], many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage.

{{see also|English Renaissance theatre|Shakespearean tragedy|Revenge play|Domestic tragedy}}

The common forms are the:
* ''Tragedy of circumstance'': people  are born into their situations, and do not choose them; such tragedies explore the consequences of birthrights, particularly for monarchs
* ''Tragedy of miscalculation'': the [[protagonist]]'s error of judgement has tragic consequences
* ''[[Revenge play]]''

In English, the most famous and most successful tragedies are those of [[William Shakespeare]] and his [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] contemporaries. Shakespeare's tragedies include:
* ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''
* ''[[Coriolanus]]''
* ''[[Hamlet]]''
* ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''
* ''[[King Lear]]''
* ''[[Macbeth]]''
* ''[[Othello]]''
* ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''
* ''[[Timon of Athens]]''
* ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''
* ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''

A contemporary of Shakespeare, [[Christopher Marlowe]], also wrote examples of tragedy in English, notably:
* ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]''
* ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]''

[[John Webster]] (1580?–1635?), also wrote famous plays of the genre:
* ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''
* ''[[The White Devil]]''

===Opera===
Contemporary with Shakespeare, an entirely different approach to facilitating the rebirth of tragedy was taken in Italy.  [[Jacopo Peri]], in the preface to his ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' refers to "the ancient Greeks and Romans (who in the opinion of many sang their staged tragedies throughout in representing them on stage)."{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 22}}  The attempts of Peri and his contemporaries to recreate ancient tragedy gave rise to the new Italian musical genre of [[opera]]. In France, tragic operatic works from the time of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] to about that of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] were not called opera, but ''tragédie en musique'' ("tragedy in music") or some similar name; the ''tragédie en musique'' is regarded as a distinct musical genre.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Graham Sadler, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/44040 "Tragédie en musique"], Grove Music Online (subscription required). Accessed March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some later operatic [[composer]]s have also shared Peri's aims: [[Richard Wagner]]'s concept of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' ("integrated work of art"), for example, was intended as a return to the ideal of Greek tragedy in which all the arts were blended in service of the drama.{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 178}} [[Nietzsche]], in his ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872) was to support Wagner in his claims to be a successor of the ancient dramatists.

==Neo-classical==
[[File:Talma as Nero in Britannicus by Racine - Delacroix - zeno.jpg|thumb|190px|French actor [[François-Joseph Talma|Talma]] as Nero in Racine's ''[[Britannicus (play)|Britannicus]].]]
For much of the 17th century, [[Pierre Corneille]], who made his mark on the world of tragedy with plays like ''Medée'' (1635) and ''Le Cid'' (1636), was the most successful writer of French tragedies. Corneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of ''Le Cid'' was even listed as a tragicomedy), for they had happy endings. In his theoretical works on theatre, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions:
* The stage—in both comedy and tragedy—should feature noble characters (this would eliminate many low-characters, typical of the farce, from Corneille's comedies). Noble characters should not be depicted as vile (reprehensible actions are generally due to non-noble characters in Corneille's plays).
* Tragedy deals with affairs of the state (wars, dynastic marriages); comedy deals with love. For a work to be tragic, it need not have a tragic ending.
* Although [[Aristotle]] says that [[catharsis]] (purgation of emotion) should be the goal of tragedy, this is only an ideal. In conformity with the moral codes of the period, plays should not show evil being rewarded or nobility being degraded.

Corneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also something he called "heroic comedies") and many continued to be successes, although the "irregularities" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticised (notably by [[François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac]]) and the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signalled the end of his preeminence.

[[Jean Racine]]'s tragedies—inspired by Greek myths, [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]—condensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, and concentrated on these characters' double-binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds. Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of [[pathos]] and amorous passion (like [[Phèdre]]'s love for her stepson) and his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy to the end of the century. Racine's two late plays ("Esther" and "Athalie") opened new doors to biblical subject matter and to the use of theatre in the education of young women. Racine also faced criticism for his irregularities: when his play, ''[[Bérénice]]'', was criticised for not containing any deaths, Racine disputed the conventional view of tragedy.

==Bourgeois==
{{further|Bourgeois tragedy|Augustan drama}}

Bourgeois tragedy (German: Bürgerliches Trauerspiel) is a form that developed in 18th-century Europe. It was a fruit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterised by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play, [[George Lillo]]'s ''The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell'', which was first performed in 1731. Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''Miss Sara Sampson'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany.

==Modern development==
In [[modernist literature]], the definition of tragedy has become less precise. The most fundamental change has been the rejection of Aristotle's dictum that true tragedy can only depict those with power and high status. [[Arthur Miller]]'s essay "Tragedy and the Common Man" (1949) argues that tragedy may also depict ordinary people in domestic surroundings.{{sfn|Miller|1949|p=894}} British playwright [[Howard Barker]] has argued strenuously for the rebirth of tragedy in the contemporary theatre, most notably in his volume ''[[Arguments for a Theatre]]''. "You emerge from tragedy equipped against lies. After the musical, you're anybody's fool," he insists.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=13}} Critics such as [[George Steiner]] have even been prepared to argue that tragedy may no longer exist in comparison with its former manifestations in classical antiquity. In ''The Death of Tragedy'' (1961) George Steiner outlined the characteristics of Greek tragedy and the traditions that developed from that period. In the Foreword (1980) to a new edition of his book Steiner concluded that ‘the dramas of Shakespeare are not a renascence of or a humanistic variant of the absolute tragic model. They are, rather, a rejection of this model in the light of tragi-comic and “realistic” criteria.’ In part, this feature of Shakespeare’s mind is explained by his bent of mind or imagination which was ‘so encompassing, so receptive to the plurality of diverse orders of experience.’ When compared to the drama of Greek antiquity and French classicism Shakespeare’s forms are ‘richer but hybrid'.&lt;ref&gt;George Steiner, ''The Death of Tragedy'' [1961] (Oxford University Press, 1980; Yale University Press, 1996), p. xiii. See also George Steiner, ‘ “Tragedy.” Reconsidered.’ ''New Literary History'' 35:1 (Winter 2004), pp. 1-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
===Aristotle===
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his work [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] that
tragedy is characterised by seriousness and involves a great [[person]] who experiences a reversal of [[luck|fortune]] (''[[Peripeteia]]''). Aristotle's [[definition]] can include a change of fortune from bad to good as in the ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', but he says that the change from good to bad as in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' is preferable because this induces [[pity]] and [[fear]] within the spectators. Tragedy results in a [[catharsis]] (emotional cleansing) or healing for the audience through their experience of these emotions in response to the suffering of the characters in the drama.

According to [[Aristotle]], "the [[structure]] of the best tragedy should not be simple but complex and one that represents incidents arousing [[fear]] and [[pity]]—for that is peculiar to this form of art."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Trans. W.H. Fyfe. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1932. Section 1452b&lt;/ref&gt;  This reversal of fortune must be caused by the tragic hero's ''[[hamartia]]'', which is often translated as either a [[character flaw]], or as a mistake (since the original Greek etymology traces back to ''hamartanein'', a sporting term that refers to an [[archery|archer]] or [[spear]]-thrower missing his target).&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Amelie Oksenberg. ''[[Literary criticism|Essays on Aristotle’s Poetics]]''. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1992. Page 178&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], "The misfortune is brought about not by [general] vice or depravity, but by some [particular] error or frailty."&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'', Aristotle&lt;/ref&gt;  The reversal is the inevitable but unforeseen result of some action taken by the hero. It is also a misconception that this reversal can be brought about by a higher power (e.g. the [[law]], the [[god]]s, [[destiny|fate]], or [[society]]), but if a character’s downfall is brought about by an external cause, [[Aristotle]] describes this as a [[misadventure]] and not a tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics''. Section 1135b&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the tragic hero may achieve some revelation or recognition ([[anagnorisis]]--"knowing again" or "knowing back" or "knowing throughout") about human fate, destiny, and the will of the gods. Aristotle terms this sort of recognition "a change from ignorance to awareness of a bond of love or hate."

In ''Poetics'', Aristotle gave the following definition in [[ancient Greek]] of the word "tragedy" (τραγῳδία):&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', 1449b&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ἔστιν οὖν τραγῳδία μίμησις πράξεως σπουδαίας καὶ τελείας μέγεθος ἐχούσης, ἡδυσμένῳ λόγῳ χωρὶς ἑκάστῳ τῶν εἰδῶν ἐν τοῖς μορίοις, δρώντων καὶ οὐ δι᾽ ἀπαγγελίας, δι᾽ ἐλέου καὶ φόβου περαίνουσα τὴν τῶν τοιούτων παθημάτων κάθαρσιν."

which means ''Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete (composed of an introduction, a middle part and an ending), and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts; performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions.''

Common usage of tragedy refers to any story with a sad ending, whereas to be an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tragedy the [[narrative|story]] must fit the set of requirements as laid out by ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.  By this definition social drama cannot be tragic because the hero in it is a victim of circumstance and incidents that depend upon the society in which he lives and not upon the inner compulsions — psychological or religious — which determine his progress towards self-knowledge and death.&lt;ref&gt;Chiari, J. ''Landmarks of Contemporary Drama''. [[London]]: [[Jenkins (publisher)|Jenkins]], 1965. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exactly what constitutes a "tragedy", however, is a frequently debated matter.

According to Aristotle, there are four species of tragedy:

1. Complex, which involves [[Peripety]] and [[Discovery (fiction)|Discovery]]

2. Suffering, tragedies of such nature can be seen in the Greek mythological stories of Ajaxes and Ixions

3. Character, a tragedy of moral or ethical character. Tragedies of this nature can be found in Phthiotides and [[Peleus]]

4. Spectacle, that of a horror-like theme. Examples of this nature are [[Graeae|Phorcides]] and [[Prometheus]]

===Hegel===
[[G.W.F. Hegel]], the German philosopher most famous for his dialectical approach to [[epistemology]] and history, also applied such a methodology to his theory of tragedy. In his essay "Hegel's Theory of Tragedy," [[A.C. Bradley]] first introduced the English-speaking world to Hegel's theory, which Bradley called the "[[tragic collision]]", and contrasted against the Aristotelian notions of the "[[tragic hero]]" and his or her "hamartia" in subsequent analyses of the Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy and of Sophocles' Antigone.{{Sfn | Bradley | 2007 | pp = 114–56}} Hegel himself, however, in his seminal "[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]" argues for a more complicated theory of tragedy, with two complementary branches which, though driven by a single dialectical principle, differentiate Greek tragedy from that which follows Shakespeare. His later lectures formulate such a theory of tragedy as a conflict of ethical forces, represented by characters, in ancient Greek tragedy, but in Shakespearean tragedy the conflict is rendered as one of subject and object, of individual personality which must manifest self-destructive passions because only such passions are strong enough to defend the individual from a hostile and capricious external world:
{{Quote |The heroes of ancient classical tragedy encounter situations in which, if they firmly decide in favor of the one ethical pathos that alone suits their finished character, they must necessarily come into conflict with the equally [''gleichberechtigt''] justified ethical power that confronts them. Modern characters, on the other hand, stand in a wealth of more accidental circumstances, within which one could act this way or that, so that the conflict is, though occasioned by external preconditions, still essentially grounded in the character. The new individuals, in their passions, obey their own nature... simply because they are what they are. Greek heroes also act in accordance with individuality, but in ancient tragedy such individuality is necessarily... a self-contained ethical pathos...  In modern tragedy, however, the character in its peculiarity  decides in accordance with subjective desires... such that congruity of character with outward ethical aim no longer constitutes an essential basis of tragic beauty...{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | pp = 567–8}}}}

Hegel's comments on a particular play may better elucidate his theory: "Viewed externally, Hamlet's death may be seen to have been brought about accidentally... but in Hamlet's soul, we understand that death has lurked from the beginning: the sandbank of finitude cannot suffice his sorrow and tenderness, such grief and nausea at all conditions of life... we feel he is a man whom inner disgust has almost consumed well before death comes upon him from outside."{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | p = 572}}

==Similar dramatic forms in world theatre==
===Ancient Indian drama===
The writer [[Bharata Muni]], in his work on [[dramatic theory]] ''[[Natya Shastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Nātyaśāstra'', नाट्य शास्त्र, c. 200 BCE – 200 CE),{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 517}} identified several ''[[Rasa (art)|rasas]]'' (such as pity, anger, disgust and terror) in the emotional responses of audiences for the [[Sanskrit drama]] of [[History of India|ancient India]]. The text also suggests the notion of [[musical mode]]s or jatis which are the origin of the notion of the modern melodic structures known as [[raga]]s. Their role in invoking emotions are emphasised; thus compositions emphasising the notes [[gandhara]] or [[rishabha]] are said to provoke "sadness" or "pathos" (''karuna rasa'') whereas [[rishabha]] evokes heroism (''vira rasa''). Jatis are elaborated in greater detail in the text ''[[Dattilam]]'', composed around the same time as the ''Treatise''.

The celebrated ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]], ''[[Mahabharata]]'', can also be related to tragedy in some ways.  According to [[Hermann Oldenberg]], the original epic once carried an immense "tragic force".&lt;ref name = Oldenberg&gt;{{Citation | first = Hermann | last = Oldenberg | author-link = Hermann Oldenberg | year = 1922 | title = Das Mahabharata | place = Göttingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was common in Sanskrit drama to adapt episodes from the ''Mahabharata'' into dramatic form.

'''''Varoom!''''' is a 1963 [[pop art]] painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] that depicts an explosion and the [[onomatopoeic]] sound that gives it its name.

== Background ==
[[File:Varoom-Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|left|''Varoom'', 1965|150px]]
In the early- and mid-1960s Lichtenstein produced several of his most notable works, many with themes of war or romance, but others with themes of explosions or brushstrokes. Several of Lichtenstein's large-scale depictions of explosions, such as ''Varoom!'' are iconic.&lt;ref name="ArtDaily 2012-05-22"/&gt;
''Varoom!'' along with ''[[Whaam!]]'' and ''[[Bratatat!]]'' are among Lichtenstein's most recognizable onomatopoeic works and was in a sense part of Lichtenstein's response to [[action painting]].
&lt;ref name="MrPorter 2013-02-12"/&gt;

Lichtenstein's list of aeronautically themed works is extensive. ''Varoom!'' is an explosion that is regarded as part of that theme.&lt;ref name="Pisano 2003"/&gt; ''Varoom!'', which depicts an instantaneous explosion, is composed of the [[primary color]]s presented over a light dotted background. Black and white specs add crackle to the composition. The block-lettered text, "VAROOM!", stands out, giving a title to the shattering event.&lt;ref name="Pisano 2003"/&gt;

In 1964, this painting served as the basis for the beginning of Lichtenstein's sculptural efforts, when he produced an enameled steel work that extended his theme of flatness. In 1965, he extended this theme to [[ceramic art]].&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weitmann 2002"/&gt;

Lichtenstein also created another painting entitled ''Varoom'' (no exclamation point, 1965).&lt;ref name="ID 1046"/&gt;

== Critical appraisal ==

''Varoom'', which spews action and drama, is based on the "visual language of comics", unlike the romance and war comic-based work that focuses more on the narrative than the graphic details as this work does.&lt;ref name="Carl 2012-07-17"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4024">At the Toyfair 2010 in New York City, [[Mattel]] revealed the '''[[WWE]] Legends action figure''' line.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geekweek.com/2010/02/mattel-unveils-wwe-legends-line.html&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are elite style and some also come with accessories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13856">'''Web fiction''' is written work of literature available primarily or solely on the [[Internet]]. A common type of web fiction is the webserial. The term comes from old [[Serial (literature)|serial]] stories that were once published regularly in [[newspapers]] and magazines. They are also sometimes referred to as '[[webcomics]] without pictures',{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} although many do use images as illustrations to supplement the text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sideroad.com/gethooked/column11.html Sideroad Magazine (July 1998), "Webisodics, Part 2"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a book, a web fiction is often not compiled and published as a whole. Instead, it is released on the [[Internet]] in installments or chapters as they are finished, although published compilations and anthologies are not unknown. The webserial form dominates in the category of [[fan fiction]], as writing a serial takes less specialized software and often less time than an ebook.

Web-based fiction dates to the earliest days of the [[World Wide Web]], including the extremely popular [[The Spot]] (1995–1997), a tale told through characters' journal entries and [[interactive fiction|interactivity with its audience]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sideroad.com/gethooked/column10.html Sideroad Magazine (July 1998), "Webisodics, Part 1"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Spot'' spawned many similar sites, including ''Ferndale'' and ''East Village'', though these were not as successful and did not last long.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/1997/09/12/feature.html Forbes Magazine (September 12, 1997), "Why Cybersoaps Don't Clean Up"]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these early ventures are no longer in existence.

Since 2008, web fiction has proliferated in popularity. Possibly as a result of this, more fans of webserials have decided to create their own, propagating the form further, leading to the number of serious, original works growing quickly. Some serials utilize the formats of the media to include things not possible in ordinary books, such as clickable maps, pop-up character bios, sorting posts by tag, illustrations, and video. Supplementary information is often available on the serial's website, sometimes in the form of wikis that fans of the work help maintain.

==Publication formats==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
Over the past few years, the primary medium for publishing webserials has been the [[blog]]. Some webserials have supplementary blogs for updates, news, or fictional blogs for the characters themselves.

[[LiveJournal]] is also a popular platform for web serials due to its large userbase and integrated communities. Some webserials are published on Livejournal directly, whereas some have LiveJournal communities for reader discussion and feedback.

Some webserials are produced on content management systems such as [[Drupal]], [[WordPress]], or [[Joomla]], which may integrate blogs directly into the site and also have many custom add-ons (such as for integrating social networking services such as [[Twitter]] or [[Facebook]]).

A distribution tool integrated into almost all media is the [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feed, so that subscribers can get updates on the latest chapters or episodes via an RSS reader or other media.

Another format in use is the [[internet forum]]. A free forum service such as [[ProBoards]], [[Ezboard]], or [[Invisionfree]] may be used to create a board for a webserial, or the webserial may be a feature of a larger board in order to benefit from its traffic. Forums can also be integrated into a webserial's main site to increase community interaction.

Some webserials have been told entirely on Twitter or have used it as a way of adding depth to the universe. Character Twitter accounts are a very popular example of this. Twitter is also a useful tool for author-fan interaction and update announcements. There are a variety of Twitter [[hashtags]] now in use for the webserial community. Facebook integration is also popular, with Facebook fanpages for webserials or webserial authors as well as character accounts.

===Blog fiction===
{{main article|Blog fiction}}
Blog fiction is a form of fiction writing that uses blogs to reach its readership. It is a small-scale fringe activity in the world of blogging, and although it has generated some literary critical interest, it remains isolated. It is presented in many forms, from a pretend diary or posted novel to a serialblog.

==Business==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}

Webserials are cheaper to run than webcomics for the most part, although the returns are not much better, if at all (except in China). Most authors must pay for the costs out of their own pockets, though the significantly lower [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] strain of text instead of pictures may help lower the expenses. Hosting and advertisement costs are still just as much a concern for non-organized webserial authors as webcomic artists.

This business generates billions of dollars of revenue for the web platforms in mainland China and the surrounding areas, the most used site are [[cmn:起点中文网|qidian.com]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qidian.com/|title=起点中文网|last=|first=|date=|website=Qǐdiǎn Zhōngwén Wǎng|publisher=阅文集团|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which hosts a total of 1,967,649 titles (as of 2016 October 2).

The advent of free blogging platforms such as the [[WordPress]] free host and [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] have freed some serial writers from financial concerns, as well as any requirement for technical knowledge. However, these free hosts provide less flexibility and also may not be as scalable as a pay host.

Many writers use platforms specifically created for hosting fiction, such as Wattpad,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wattpad.com|title = wattpad|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fictionpress,&lt;ref name=Fictionpress&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://fictionpress.com|title = fictionpress|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or fictionhub.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://fictionhub.io|title = fictionhub|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donations and '[[tip jars]]' are a common way of getting money for webserials, often using services such as [[PayPal]], but one of the main means of monetizing Web serials is advertising on blogs, which can allow writers to both host banners or purchase them on other sites and blogs. This can allow authors to recoup many of the costs associated with online novel creation. These are sometimes sufficient to cover the basic costs for hosting, and some of the more popular webserials can succeed with their entire budget made from donations or revenue of this type.

Another financing method is what WebLit author MCM refers to as "Serial+":{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} readers are shown a schedule for how long it would take them to read the whole story at the rate of posting new installments, and offered the option of buying the entire story on the spot.

A few webserial authors have taken to collecting their work and releasing in a book format for easy consumption offline. Self-publishing is key in this field, and services such as [[CafePress]] and [[Lulu.com]] are often used for distribution and sales of these anthologies.
The advent and acceptance of the [[ebook]] has allowed writers to become quite prolific with "bound collections" offered as downloads in formats such as [[pdf]], [[Smashwords]], and [[Mobipocket]].

On-demand merchandising sites like [[CafePress]] and [[Zazzle]] are also sources of income from sales of T-shirts, mugs, calendars, mousepads and other fan items.

Some publishers have started using serials on their sites as "eye bait" and proving grounds for novels, [[Tor Books]]. Similarly, writers with established series have been able to continue writing those series after being dropped by conventional publishers, as [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]] has done with his [[Ethshar]] novels.

==Types==

===Web serial===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
Webserials typically come in three main styles of plot cohesiveness. One is self-contained, a storytelling style which has no or little plot connections between installments. Stories are tied together by their universe, subject matter, atmosphere, or plot structure. Stories such as these are very often [[surrealist]] or [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]], although some authors do use this format simply to gain the ability to switch characters on a regular basis.

The next is loose continuity. Loose continuity stories share the same universe or world by default, and tie into a grander story. However, while the plot arcs are designed to be read to their maximum benefit by those who are most familiar with the world, it is not so self-referential that it becomes impossible to follow for a new reader without aid. Loose continuity stories can simply be individual units, or can take a [[mini-series]] feel. They may run in tightly cohesive, short arcs that must be read from the beginning, but only a basic familiarization with the premise may be necessary to enjoy each specific story arc.

The last style is tightly cohesive. As the name implies, webserials of this type very closely intertwine episodes or chapters with each other, and depend on the reader being familiar with as much of the story beforehand as possible. They are often meant to be read as one would read a book, though obviously accounting for better and more frequent natural breaks in the plot than a book would usually require.

===Fan fiction===
{{main article|Fan fiction}}
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}

Fan fiction popularized the publishing of writing on the internet and set the standards for much of the community interaction surrounding webserials. Many fanfiction works have been published in multi-part works of epic length which prepared internet-based reading audiences for the easy digestion of serialized original works. Also, some webserial authors (and many authors in general) made their start in fanfiction before setting out for original work. Therefore, the readerships for fanfiction and webserials intersect quite a bit, and some fandom language and [[Internet meme|memes]] are shared by the webserial community. Most webserials tend towards regular publication schedules, however, whereas the bulk of fanfiction is published at the author's convenience. In fanfiction there is less obligation to finish or continue stories.

Many fan fiction archives (such as the popular [[Fanfiction.net]] archive) are set up to accommodate and encourage the publication of serial works. Fanfiction.net has a sister site ([[Fiction Press]]&lt;ref name=Fictionpress/&gt;) for original work with the same organizational structure.

===Web novel===
A web novel, sometimes called a virtual novel, is a novel published online.  Web novels or "webfiction" exist in both free-to-read and pay-to-read formats. Free-to-read formats are voluntarily indexed at sites such as Webfiction Guide&lt;ref&gt;http://webfictionguide.com&lt;/ref&gt; or Muses Success.&lt;ref&gt;http://muses-success.info&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interactive novel====
{{main article|Interactive novel}}

The interactive novel is a form of digital fiction. While authors of traditional paper-and-ink [[novel]]s have sometimes tried to give readers the random directionality offered by true [[hypertext]]ing, this approach was not completely feasible until the development of [[HTML]]. Paper novels (indeed, some digital novels) are linear, that is, read from page to page in a straight line. Interactive novels, however, offer readers a unique way to read fiction by  choosing a page, a character, or a direction. By following hyperlinked phrases within the novel, readers can find new ways to understand characters. There is no wrong way to read a hypertext interactive novel. Links embedded within the pages are meant to be taken at a reader's discretion &amp;ndash; to allow the reader a choice in the novel's world.

===Webcomic===
{{main article|Webcomic}}
Webcomics, online comics, or Internet comics are [[comics]] published on a [[website]]. While most are published exclusively on the web, some are also published in [[magazine]]s, [[newspaper]]s, or often [[Self-publishing|self-published]] books.

Webcomics can be compared to self-published print comics in that almost anyone can create their own webcomic and publish it. As of January 2007, the four largest webcomic [[Web hosting service|hosting services]] hosted over 18,000 webcomics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.comicspace.com/?p=766 | title=The Number of Webcomics in the World | first=Joey | last=Manley | date=2007-01-03| work=ComicSpace Blog | accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from traditional [[comic strip]]s to [[graphic novel]]s and covering many [[genre]]s and subjects.&lt;ref name="CCP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A36337 | title=Webcomics are profane, explicit, humorous — and influencing trends | first=Steven | last=Lacy | date=2007-11-21 | work=Charleston City Paper | publisher=Noel Mermer | accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
