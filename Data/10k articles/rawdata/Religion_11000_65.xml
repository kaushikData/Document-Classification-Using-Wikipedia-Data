&lt;/ref&gt; The topic of theological responses to [[evil]] and suffering in Black religion provided the foundation of Pinn's early work. Today, Pinn's research interests span theory and method in the study of religion, black religious aesthetics, religion and popular culture, and African-American humanism.&lt;ref name="Anthony B.

==Black humanism in relation to other religious traditions==

Throughout his work, Pinn refers to his approach to humanism as a "religion."&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;   In so doing, Pinn cites humanist [[Gordon D. Kaufman|Gordon Kaufman]]'s definition of religion as "that which helps humans find orientation ‘for life in the world, together with motivation for living and acting in accordance with this orientation.’"&lt;ref name="anybody"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;   In other words, for Pinn, religion need not be theistic.

In ''Why Lord?'', Pinn's humanism "involves an increase in humanity's importance which makes impossible the location of a space for [[God]]."&lt;ref name="whylord"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|142}} He continues, "Religious answers to life's meaninglessness promote an embracing of suffering which reinforces life's meaninglessness rather than ending it."&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|153}} In other work, however, Pinn moderates this claim.  In a 1997 essay, Pinn describes humanism as another contribution to the plurality of religious traditions.&lt;ref name="anybody"/&gt;   In ''Varieties of African American Religious Experience'' (1999), he acknowledges that "the needs of various human communities are complex and varied enough to allow for a plurality of religious traditions."&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;   In a 2002 interview, Pinn states that the Black Church, although in crisis, "has tremendous potential" for addressing the [[social justice]] issues that affect African Americans.&lt;ref name="trussell"/&gt;   Although Pinn's work reaches into non-Christian sources of [[theology]], much of his academic focus remains centered on the history and theology of the African-American [[Christian]] Church.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony B. Pinn, ''The Black Church in the Post-[[Civil Rights]] Era'', (New York: Orbis Books, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, Pinn differentiates Black humanism from other non-theistic worldviews such as [[atheism]].  Citing the work of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], Pinn notes that Black humanism has no interest in disproving the existence of God.&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|154–156}} Rather, it is "not overly concerned with God as a negative [[myth]], but rather God as a liberating myth that is nonetheless unsubstantiated."&lt;ref name="anybody"/&gt;   Thus, oppressed [[African Americans]] need not waste their time disproving God's existence, but are simply better off seeking their liberation with the human tools of "desire for transformation, human creativity, physical strength, and untapped collective potential."&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|158}}

This "full human potential" is capable of analyzing and working to rectify problems of oppression in the African-American community.&lt;ref name="coleman"&gt;{{Citation

==Pinn's approach to theodicy, redemptive suffering, and Black humanism==

In ''Why Lord? Suffering and Evil in Black Theology'' (1995), Anthony Pinn establishes himself as a [[black theology|black theologian]] and Black humanist.  In ''Why Lord?'', Pinn seeks to critique various responses found within Black religion to the question of theodicy, or God's role in the suffering of humanity.  His critique is based on the ultimate goal of Black liberation.&lt;ref name="whylord" /&gt;{{rp|13}} Pinn cites John Hick's options for "the resolution of the problem of evil," which are the following: "(1) a rethinking of the nature/purpose of evil; or, (2) the postulating of a 'limited' God; or, (3) a questioning/denial of God's existence."&lt;ref name="whylord"&gt;
{{Cite book

  | url = 
  | doi = 
  | id = 
  | isbn = }}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}}

The solutions that Black theology has formally articulated, Pinn argues, have essentially been limited to the first two options.  All theodicean arguments following the first approach are not useful in the struggle for the liberation of oppressed people because, to varying degrees, they all rely on the concept of redemptive suffering.&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Pinn considers these arguments "unacceptable because they counteract efforts at liberation by finding something of value in Black suffering." He places the work of [[James H. Cone]], an early promulgator of [[Black theology]], in the first category.  Although Cone refuses to accept Black suffering as God's will, he nonetheless embraces suffering which Blacks incur as a result of resistance to [[oppression]].  Pinn rejects this distinction between positive and negative suffering, which he calls purely academic.&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|85–88}} Instead, a Black theology of liberation must characterize suffering "as unquestionably and unredeemably evil."&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|89}}

Pinn follows the thinking of existentialist writer [[Albert Camus]], who rejects theodicean arguments for God limiting God's own intervention, arguing that "if God is [[omnipotent]] and permits human suffering, then God is a murderer."&lt;ref name="cone"&gt;

  | location = New York
  | pages = 79
  | url = 
  | doi = 
  | id = 
  | isbn = }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Theodicean arguments based on the postulating of a limited God, as presented by [[William R. Jones]] and [[Delores Williams]], are not valid at all, as Pinn questions the efficacy and worth of worship and action in the service of a limited, ultimately ineffective deity.&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|111}}

Rather, Pinn proposes that Black theologians examine the third theodicean solution: the questioning or denial of God's existence.  In this approach, Pinn draws on William R. Jones’ important work ''Is God a White Racist?'' (1998), which questions God's goodness.  He ultimately takes this point farther than Jones, arguing that if God exists and is self-limiting in God's support for Black liberation, as Jones concludes, God is indeed a racist.&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|93}}

Pinn describes his approach as fundamentally pragmatic: where faith in God entails a justification of human suffering, he "would rather lose God than human value."&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|142}} James H. Cone writes that "Black theology must relate itself to the human situation unique to oppressed persons generally and blacks particularly.  If black theology fails to do this adequately, then the black community will and should destroy it."&lt;ref name="cone36"&gt;

  | isbn = }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

To this end, Pinn advocates a position of "strong humanism," a non-theistic religion that concerns itself, above all, with human life, while rejecting the existence of God.&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|148}}
{{original research inline |date=November 2010}}

In 2017 Pinn published a book, ''When Colorblindness Isn't the Answer: Humanism and the Challenge of Race,'' on why humanists should embrace racial justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehumanist.com/magazine/may-june-2017/features/humanism-challenge-privilege|title=Humanism and the Challenge of Privilege - TheHumanist.com|date=2017-04-18|work=TheHumanist.com|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of theology==

Pinn draws on a variety of historical traditions in the formation of his religion of Black humanism.  Examples from Black folk stories and jokes, [[spirituals]], [[blues]], [[rap]], and political discourse form the basis of Pinn's work.  In his analysis of these diverse sources, Pinn employs what he terms "nitty-gritty [[hermeneutics]]," an approach to theological thought that is constructed from the hard realities of human experience, unconfined by a need to fit into preconceived Christian doctrines.&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|116}} In other words, nitty-gritty hermeneutics privilege solutions to the problem of oppression over the maintenance of religious tradition.&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

He suggests that this approach is already widespread within [[hip-hop]] music, citing lyrics and quotes from [[Salt-n-Pepa]], [[N.W.A|NWA]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Grand Master Flash]] and the [[Furious Five]], [[KRS-One]], and [[Chuck D]], all of which seek to describe the harsh realities of life.  Essentially, Pinn attempts to transform the language of rap music, which expresses nitty-gritty theology on a popular level, into professional theology, acceptable to academia.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of often overtly Christian sources, Pinn finds meaningful support for the historical legitimacy of Black humanism.  The tradition of spirituals, communally composed by [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]] in the [[United States]], provides an early study in Black theodicy, questioning the purpose of slaves’ suffering.&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|36}} He quotes [[Daniel Payne]], a leader in the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], who in 1839 wrote about the extent to which slaves, aware of the hypocrisy of their Christian masters, "distrust both the goodness and justice of God."  In a telling example, Pinn quotes a runaway slave, who said he was not a Christian because "white men treat us so bad in [[Mississippi]] that we can’t be Christians."&lt;ref name="anybody"/&gt;   Pinn also finds critiques of God's efficacy in [[Riggin Earl]]'s "[[Brer Rabbit]]" stories, slave folklore that portrays God as weak or comical, and blues and rap music that seek worldly solutions and reject theistic religion.  Pinn also refers to humanism among African Americans within the [[American Communists|American Communist]] and [[Civil Rights]] struggles of the 20th century.  Academic sources for Black humanism include [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] and [[Nella Larsen]].  Pinn cites Wright's rejection, in the 1940 novel ''[[Native Son]]'', of religion's solutions to "life's complexity and absurdity," which "promote an embracing of suffering which reinforces life's meaninglessness rather than ending it."   He affirms Larsen's conclusion, asserted in her 1928 novel ''Quicksand'', that God's failure to deliver humans from suffering means that oppressed people must overcome "through human strength, but without guarantee of success."&lt;ref name="whylord"/&gt;{{rp|132, 143–53, passim}}{{original research inline |date=November 2010}}

In "Anybody There? Reflections on African American Humanism," Pinn acknowledges the importance of the work of theologians such as James H. Cone in the 1960s and 70s.  He states that Cone's early writings, which presented theological arguments for Black power and liberation, ultimately became part of the separation between the Christian-based [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the more radical [[Black Power]] movement.

In ''Varieties of African-American Religious Experience'', Pinn considers a wide range of non-Christian theological sources, including "Voodoo, Orisha devotion, Santeria, the Nation of Islam, and Black Humanism," and advocates a broader understanding of African-American "sources, norms, and doctrines" beyond the [[Protestant]] church.&lt;ref name="coleman"/&gt;

'''Artabazos''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] Αρτάβαζος) ([[floruit|fl.]] 389&amp;nbsp;– 328 BC) was a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] general and [[satrap]].  He was the son of the Persian satrap of [[Phrygia]],  [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]], and younger kinsman (most probably his brother) of [[Ariobarzanes of Phrygia]] who revolted against [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] around 356 BC.

==Revolt by Ariobarzan==

In 362 BC, Artabazos was sent by [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] to capture [[Datames]], the [[satrap]] of [[Cappadocia]], who had joined in the [[Revolt of the Satraps|Satraps' revolt]] by Artabazus' brother, Ariobarzanes.  However, Artabazos was defeated by Datames.{{r|diod_15.91}}

==Rebellion against the Persian King==

Following the capture and death of his brother, Artabazos was made satrap of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]], but in 356 BC he refused obedience to the Persian king, [[Artaxerxes III of Persia|Artaxerxes III]].  Artabazos then became involved in a revolt against the king and against other satraps who acknowledged the authority of Artaxerxes III.

Artabazos was at first supported by [[Chares of Athens|Chares]], an [[Athens|Athenian]] general, and his mercenaries, whom he rewarded very generously. Later, Artabazos was also supported by the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]], who sent him 5,000 men under [[Pammenes of Thebes|Pammenes]]. With the assistance of these and other allies, Artabazos defeated his enemies in two great battles.

However, Artaxerxes III was later able to deprive Artabazos of his Athenian and [[Boeotia]]n allies, whereupon Artabazos was defeated by the king's general, [[Autophradates]], and was taken prisoner. [[Mentor of Rhodes|Mentor]] and [[Memnon of Rhodes|Memnon]], two brothers-in-law of Artabazos, who had supported him, still continued the revolt, as they were aided by the Athenian mercenary leader, [[Charidemus]].  Together they were able to free Artabazos.

After this, Artabazos seems either to have continued his rebellious operations or at least started a fresh revolt.  However, eventually, he had no choice but to flee with Memnon and his family.  They went into exile and took refuge with [[Philip II of Macedon]]ia.

==Return to Persia==

During the absence of Artabazos, Mentor, his brother-in-law, was of great service to the king of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] in his war against [[Nectanebo II]] of [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]].  After the close of this war, in the summer of 342 BC, Artaxerxes gave Mentor the command against the rebellious satraps of western Asia.  Mentor took advantage of this opportunity to ask the king to grant a pardon to Artabazos and Memnon.  The king agreed and both men and their families were able to return to Persia.{{r|diod_16.22_34_52_dem}}

In the subsequent reign of [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III Codomannus]], Artabazos distinguished himself by his loyalty and commitment to the new Persian king. He took part in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]], and afterwards accompanied Darius on his flight from [[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]] Macedonian armies.  After the final defeat and death of Darius III in 330 BC, [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] recognised and rewarded Artabazos for his loyalty to the Persian king by giving him the satrapy of [[Bactria]].

==Family==

Artabazos' daughter, [[Barsine]], may have married Alexander and may have been the mother of [[Heracles (Macedon)|Heracles]].  Another daughter, [[Artakama|Artacama]], was given in marriage to [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]]; and a third daughter, Artonis, was given in marriage to [[Eumenes]].  In 328 BC, Artabazos resigned his satrapy, which was given to [[Cleitus the Black|Cleitus]].{{r|arr_3.23_29_7.4_curt_3.13_5.9_12_6.5_7.3_5_8.1}}

Artabazos had a son named [[Pharnabazus, son of Artabazus|Pharnabazus]] (fl. 370 - 320 BC).

==History==
The  Institute was founded in 1985 and was under the suggestion and direction of the [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the Bahá'ís of India.&lt;ref name="bic"&gt;[http://www.wfdd.org.uk/programmes/case_studies/barli.pdf Empowering Young Women to Improve Rural Lives - The Story of the Barli Development Institute for Rural Women, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India.] A case study in Bahá'í Development.

==Awards/Certifications==
Through June 1996, a total of 769 rural tribal women have been trained at the Institute with a variety of measures of successful impact on the lives of graduates including:&lt;ref name="bvirw"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/rainforest/2519/ | title = Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women | author = Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women | accessdate = 2006-09-15 | date=  2002-02-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209010110/http://www.geocities.com/rainforest/2519/|archivedate=2006-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*45% of them established small businesses, 
*62% are functionally literate or semi-literate (which has motivated people to send their children to school), 
*42% have started growing vegetables, 
*97% are using safe drinking water, 
*all the former trainees and many of their male relatives have given up drinking alcohol, 
*caste prejudices have been eliminated.
In contrast, in 1994, only 92 of every 1000 tribal girls were literate; only 3 in every 1000 made it as far as middle school; and just 1 in every 1000 actually completed her secondary schooling.&lt;ref name="bic"/&gt;

Further:
*In 1990, two of its (formerly illiterate) trainees won first prize in a Learner's Song Competition sponsored by [[UNESCO]].
*In 1990, the literacy methodology used at the Institute was adopted by the [[University of Leicester]], U.K.
*In 1992, [[UNEP]] conferred the Institute with the [[Global 500 Roll of Honour]] for outstanding environmental achievements in helping to eradicate [[guinea worm]] from 302 villages in [[Jhabua]] district in educating and training women and villagers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global500.org/ViewLaureate.asp?ID=283 Global 500 - Adult Award Winner in 1992] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604065613/http://www.global500.org/ViewLaureate.asp?ID=283 |date=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "...now the district is completely free of Guinea Worms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahai.com/thebahais/pg63b.htm "The Baha'is - A Profile of the Bahá'í Faith and its Worldwide Community"]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- *In 1993, Mrs. Eleanor Mitten, a student from Smith College, Massachusetts, U.S.A. and Ms. Paula Drewek, a faculty member from the University of Michigan, came to do research at the Institute. Perhaps find studies published --&gt;
*In 1994, the Institute is listed in [[UNESCO]]'s [[INNOV]] database as one of 81 successful basic education projects in developing countries.
*Since 1990, the Institute has been a placement agency for eight [[Master of Social Work]] students from the Indore [[School of Social Work]].

Graduates receive a certificate through the [[National Open School]] program.&lt;ref name="bic"/&gt;

==Programmes==
The institute offers a variety of classes arranged around six-month and one year residential programs at its {{convert|6|acre|m2|sing=on}} facilities and three months non-residential at the satellite outreach centers.&lt;ref name="Bhopal "/&gt; Programmes include [[Family and consumer science|family life skills]], [[environmental education]] and [[gardening]], [[literacy]] in [[Hindi]], [[public health]],&lt;ref name="asha"/&gt; and [[vocational education]]; some subjects are taught directly and some [[Holistic education|holistically]]. Since 1998 the Institute has helped provide and train students to use large [[solar ovens]].&lt;ref name="background"&gt;[http://news.bahai.org/story/176 Backgrounder: the Barli Development Institute for Rural Women Indore, India] 18 November 2002 (BWNS)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also "train the trainer" type programs and refresher courses for area coordinators.&lt;ref name="Bhopal "/&gt;

Many former graduates work approximately 100 days each year on field visits to conduct awareness raising programmes, recruit women for courses, do surveys and research, and to assist the former trainees to organize women's committees.&lt;ref name="bvirw"/&gt;

==Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat==
{{main|Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat}}
Supported and funded by the [[Society of Saint Pius X]], the Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat extends the SSPX's traditionalist critique of current [[Catholic Church]] practices to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. It opposes some decisions of the [[Second Vatican Council]] and aspects of [[ecumenism]] and [[interreligious relations|interreligious]] [[dialogue]] practised by the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the [[Holy See]].

The Society also opposes the replacement of the traditional [[Church Slavonic]] language by the vernacular [[Ukrainian language]] in the [[liturgy]], and opposes liturgical [[liturgical latinisation|de-latinisation]], the removal of [[Latin Rite]] practices such as [[Eucharistic adoration]], the [[Rosary]], and the [[Stations of the Cross]], which had been adopted within the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

On 10 February 2004, Cardinal [[Lubomyr Husar]], Archbishop of Lviv and Major Archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, declared that Kovpak, through his close links to the SSPX, had incurred [[excommunication]] by "recognis(ing) the uncanonical foreign Bishop [[Bernard Fellay]], who does not recognise the authority of the Pope of Rome and is not united with the Catholic Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;2559/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-07 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050420025155/http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;2559/ |archive-date=2005-04-20 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kovpak denied that he recognised Bishop Fellay as his own canonical bishop, and declared his intention to appeal to the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;2573/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-09-07 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050420025325/http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;2573/ |archive-date=2005-04-20 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holy See]] accepted his appeal and declared the excommunication null for lack of canonical form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laportelatine.org/accueil/entret/2006/jenkins/versionanglaise/anglais2006.php An Interview with the SSPX Prior of Warsaw] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823133035/http://www.laportelatine.org/accueil/entret/2006/jenkins/versionanglaise/anglais2006.php |date=2006-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excommunication==
Kovpak was definitively excommunicated in November 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=54919 Ukrainian priest excommunicated]&lt;/ref&gt; after having the Latin-Rite SSPX bishop [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]] ordain two priests and seven deacons for his society in spite of the prohibition in [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3N.HTM canons 1015 §1 and 1017] of the Code of Canon Law.

==Kovpak's response==
To justify his actions and respond to the accusations levelled against him by the leaders of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Kovpak wrote a book entitled ''Persecuted Tradition''. In it, he charged that bishops have harassed traditional Greek Catholic priests and refused Ukrainian laity [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] because of the laity insisting on kneeling for it.

He also accused the UGCC leaders of having publicly posed for photographs and conducted interreligious payer meetings with [[Buddhists]] and [[Hare Krishnas]]. He further cited virulently [[Anti-Catholic]] remarks by the Orthodox prelates with whom Cardinal Husar is pursuing ecumenism and ''"is seeking a false unity"''.&lt;ref&gt;Book prelude. Kovpak, B. ''Persecuted Tradition''.&lt;/ref&gt; The SSPX is preparing an [[English language|English]] translation of the book, the original of which is in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://papastronsay.com/Ukraine.htm Page containing "Tradition Persecuted in Western Ukraine", a review of Kovpak's book] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825205306/http://papastronsay.com/Ukraine.htm |date=August 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifting of the Écône excommunications==
While the excommunication of the four bishops whom Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] consecrated in spite of the prohibition of [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3N.HTM#39 Canon 1013] was, at their request, lifted in January 2009, Kovpak has not sought to have his own excommunication in connection with two other canons of the Code of Canon Law lifted by the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church or by the Holy See.

==Parish church==
The Society of St. Josaphat holds possession of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic parish church in the village of [[Ivano-Frankove]] ([[Yaniv, Lviv|Yaniv]]), which is seen as their national headquarters. Those who support the Archeparch of Lviv have to celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] in the [[Latin Rite]] church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;8237/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-08-12 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120911020015/http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;8237/ |archive-date=2012-09-11 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the Indian caste|Beldar Conehead|Coneheads}}
The '''Beldar''' are a historically nomadic [[Caste system in India|caste]], originally from [[Northern India]] and now inhabiting many other parts of that country.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das, pages 245–248&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
The community are the traditionally natives of North India, and are similar to the Odh communities, who are the natives of west India. They also claim common ancestry with [[Kewat]] community, who similarly refer to themselves as Odhs.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das, page 268&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Maharashtra]], the Beldar are found mainly in the districts of [[Aurangabad district, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Nasik]], [[Pune]], [[Amravati]], [[Akola]], [[Yavatmal district|Yawatmal]], [[Ahmednagar]], [[Sholapur]], [[Kolhapur]], [[Sangli]], [[Satara district|Satara]], [[Ratnagiri]] and the city of [[Mumbai]]. The Beldar claim to have immigrated from [[Rajasthan]] some five centuries ago. They still speak [[Beldari Language]] among themselves and [[Marathi language|Marathi]] with outsiders. and also use a Beldari language. The community is strictly [[Endogamy|endogamous]], and consists of a number of exogamous clans. Their main clans are the Chapula, Narora, Davawar, Kharola, Jailwar, Faatara, Horwar, Chhapawar, Tuse, Pannewar, Mahore, Basniwar, Bahr, Gorala and Udainwar.&lt;ref name="maharashtra"&gt;People of India Maharashtra Volume XXX Part One edited by B.V Bhanu, B.R Bhatnagar, D.K Bose, V.S Kulkarni and J Sreenath, pages 192–197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The Beldar of [[Uttar Pradesh]] are still mainly involved in their tradition of [[Navvy|navvies]]. They are employed by the state in the constructions of roads. Generally, whole families participate in the construction industry. Many Beldar are [[Nomad|nomadic]], shifting from place to place, looking for work at construction sites. A small number of Beldar are also involved in the selling of fruits and vegetables. The Beldar are a [[Hindu]] community, and are found throughout the state, speaking a number of dialects of [[Hindi]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das, page 247&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional occupation of the Beldar in Maharashtra was [[masonry]]. Many are still employed in the construction industry. The community is entirely landless, and was historically nomadic. A considerable number of Beldar are also employed by the various brick kilns.&lt;ref name="maharashtra"/&gt;

The [[2011 Census of India]] for Uttar Pradesh, where they were classified as a [[Scheduled Caste]], showed the Beldar population as 189,614.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/SC_ST/PCA-A10/SC-0900-PCA-A-10-ddw.xlsx |title= A-10 Individual Scheduled Caste Primary Census Abstract Data and its Appendix – Uttar Pradesh |publisher=Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner, India |accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Social Christianity}}

'''Christians for Socialism''' ({{lang-es|'''Cristianos por el socialismo'''}}; '''CPS''') was a worldwide political and cultural movement focused on [[social inequality]] and economic injustice,&lt;ref name="Onis 1972"/&gt; inspired by [[liberation theology]].{{sfnm |1a1=B.&amp;nbsp;H. Smith |1y=1982 |1p=232 |2a1=Turner |2y=1994 |2p=8}} It was founded in 1971.

==Founding==
Having begun in April 1971,{{sfn|Lies|Malone|2006|p=91}} Christians for Socialism first gained notoriety when a collection of eighty [[Chile]]an priests, known as the "Group of 80", publicly declared their support of the construction of [[socialism]] along the lines being followed by then-President [[Salvador Allende]].&lt;ref name="Onis 1972"/&gt;{{sfn|Nessan|2012|p=41}} The Secretariat of Christians for Socialism was formally established in September 1973. The group was predominantly composed of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] members of the [[Christian left]] who were inspired and spurred on by the [[Second Vatican Council]].

==Project==
CPS was founded to counteract a presumption that Christian institutions were inherently opposed to [[socialism]]. While its founders found aspects of socialist programs that they wished to critique, they wanted to do so as insiders within the socialist movement, rather than as adversaries.{{sfn|C. Smith|1991|p=182}} From their beginnings as supporters of Allende,{{sfn|Eecmy|n.d.|p=116}} CPS has been associated with firm support for socialist leaders.{{sfn|Floridi|1986|p=49}} Accordingly, CPS leaders cultivated strong ties with Cuban Marxist politician [[Fidel Castro]].{{sfnm |1a1=Floridi |1y=1986 |1p=49 |2a1=C. Smith |2y=1991 |2pp=182ff}} It was intended as a movement of active political involvement and participation,{{sfn|C. Smith|1991|pp=182ff}} and involved discussions bringing together current political events and church documents in light of each other.{{sfn|Turner|1994|p=8}} CPS inspired a series of social programs in the public sector.&lt;!--{{citation-needed}}--&gt; Priests in CPS led union units and organized peasant federations.&lt;ref name="Onis 1972"/&gt;

==Antecedents==
&lt;!-- For more detail, see B. H. Smith 1982:249 --&gt;
In Chile the immediate antecedent to CPS was the ''{{ill|Iglesia Joven|es}}'' movement.{{sfnm |1a1=Garcés |1y=2011 |1p=222 |2a1=Hojman |2y=1985 |2p=72}}&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Commonweal|date=1975|volume=102|page=269|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzkdAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Iglesia+Joven%22+%22Christians+for+Socialism%22|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; In Italy, many of the young people who had been involved in the [[1968 movement in Italy|Italian student and worker protests of 1968]] joined the movement, and the [[Christian Associations of Italian Workers]] (ACLI) was very supportive.

==Leaders==
[[Alfonso López Trujillo|López Trujillo]] considers {{ill|Giulio Girardi|es||it}} a major leader of CPS.{{sfn|McGovern|1989|p=48}} Another prominent leader was the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] priest {{ill|Lidia Menapace|de||it}}, who was also a significant figure in the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian Catholic resistance during World War II]]. In Spain, [[Alfonso Carlos Comín]] was a key leader in establishing the movement. The theologian [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]] was also a member{{sfn|Bell|2001|p=80}} and led sessions at all the major conferences.{{sfn|Turner|1994|p=8}}

==Suppression==
CPS faced opposition from the start. [[Left-wing politics|Left-leaning]] priests from Brazil and Bolivia were supportive but unable to participate in gatherings due to severe police control.&lt;ref name="Onis 1972"/&gt; CPS was short-lived in Chile, due to strong resistance from the [[Episcopal Conference of Chile]] under the direction of its secretary general, bishop [[Carlos Oviedo Cavada]].{{sfnm |1a1=Marshner |1y=1974 |1p=42 |2a1=Tombs |2y=2002 |2p=148}} In their letter condemning the movement, the bishops there argued that while the church speaks to "politics insofar as it underlies every social reality", it should not be involved in "partisan activity".{{sfn|Eagleson|1975|pp=196f}} Chilean clergy involved in the movement were banned from political participation altogether in April 1973.{{sfnm |1a1=Cavada |1y=1974 |2a1=Lies |2a2=Malone |2y=2006 |2p=92}} The movement was suppressed by the Chilean military government after the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup of 1973]].{{sfn|Turner|1994|p=8}} Father {{ill|Pablo Richard|de|Pablo Richard|es|Pablo Richard Guzmán|pt|Pablo Richard}}, one of the most active members of CPS, left Chile at this time.{{sfn|Sigmund|1990|p=229}}

==Gatherings==
A number of important gatherings have been held under the auspices of Christians for Socialism. In 1972, 400 members met for a week at a textile union hall, urging "class struggle [as] the only valid course to necessary social change in Latin America."&lt;ref name="Onis 1972"&gt;{{cite news | last=De Onis | first=Juan | title=Assembly in Chile Urges Socialism | newspaper=The New York Times | date=4 May 1972 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/04/archives/assembly-in-chile-urges-socialism-group-led-by-priests-seeks.html | accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPS brought together similar Latin American movements in the Latin American Meeting of Christians for Socialism 1974 in [[Santiago]], Chile.

In 1975, the Christians for Socialism conference in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], formally introduced [[liberation theology]] to the United States.{{sfn|Turner|1994|p=8}} This event was a significant convergence where [[Black theology|black]], [[feminism|feminist]], and third-world [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] movements joined together and recognized each other as peers in the same process of liberation, while also strongly critiquing one another.{{sfn|Turner|1994|pp=8f}} A detailed account of the meeting was published.{{sfn|Torres|Eagleson|1976}}

Christians for Socialism groups sprung up in France, Italy, and West Germany.{{sfn|May|2003|p=101}} In Germany, CPS was a radical rival to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] liberalism and "[[German idealism]]'s aspirations to freedom".{{sfn|May|2003|p=101}}

==Present day==
The CPS group has as fundamental milestone the celebration of its annual conferences that are held in Spain, alternately in [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]]. CPS has a presence mainly in Madrid, Catalonia, Menorca and with individuals in different autonomous communities, such as Andalusia, Galicia, Aragon and others.
At present, the CPS group remains within a larger movement called "Christian Networks", as a critical and reflective encounter in relation to the church, society, and politics.

In the United States, Christians for Socialism was most active through the 1970s and early 1980s. After the election of [[Ronald Reagan]], the movement lost some of its momentum and disbanded. However, in January 2018, Christians for Socialism: North America restarted its struggle for a Christian left organized around the same ideas from the movement started in Chile in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=15 January 2018 |title=Manifesto |url=https://christiansforsocialism.org/manifesto/ |publisher=Christians for Socialism |access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
López Trujillo has critiqued CPS for holding an understanding of liberation too strongly influenced by [[Marxism|Marxist]] political theory rather than the integral Christian liberation stance espoused by the [[Latin American Episcopal Conference]].{{sfn|McGovern|1989|p=48}} It has been said{{by whom|date=August 2017}} that for some members of Christians for Socialism, there is "no salvation incarnate outside of class struggle."{{sfn|Ortiz|1980|p=102}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="89393">The '''deities of Philippine mythology''' are the gods, goddesses and [[diwata]]s worshipped by [[Filipino people|ancient Filipinos]] before the Christianization of the natives after the [[History of the Philippines (1565–1898)#Spanish expeditions and conquest|Spanish conquest of the Philippines]]. These deities and stories have similar elements and characteristics when compared to other mythologies, especially in [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. As the majority of pre-colonial societies in the [[Philippines]] prior to Spanish colonization viewed everything in balance, many gods and goddesses of these societies were depicted to possess both female and male personifications or the personifications of an opposite gender, in line with the same gender balance personifications in many indigenous mythologies in Southeast Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. These "shared beliefs" in balancing gender personifications upholds the theory that some Southeast Asians migrated towards Oceania and later towards the Americas bringing with them portions of their culture.

== List of gods and goddesses ==

Ancient [[Philippine mythology]] varies among the many indigenous tribes of the Philippines. During the pre-Spanish era, some tribes believed in a single [[God|supreme being]] who created the world and everything in it, along with lesser deities. Others worshipped a multitude of trees in a form of [[animism]]. Below are some of the gods and goddesses of the various ancient Philippine ethnic groups:

=== Ancient Tagalog deities ===
{{see also|Tagalog people|Dambana}}
This section includes Ancient Tagalog deities from a certain pantheon story. The ancient [[Tagalog people]] used to cover the following: present-day [[Calabarzon]] region except the Polilo Islands, northern Quezon, Alabat island, the Bondoc Peninsula, and easternmost Quezon; [[Marinduque]]; [[Bulacan]] except for its eastern part; and southwest [[Nueva Ecija]], as much of Nueva Ecija used to be a vast rainforest where numerous nomadic ethnic groups stayed and left. When the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] expanded its domain, swallowing the [[Bicol region]] except Masbate and Catanduanes, the entire [[Central Luzon]] region, [[Nueva Viscaya]], [[La Union]], and [[Benguet]], the Tagalogs remained in their core zones and did not impose a migration policy. during When the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] fell due to the Spanish the Tagalog-majority areas grew through Tagalog migrations in portions of Central Luzon and north Mimaropa as a Tagalog  migration policy was implemented by Spain. This was continued by the Americans when they defeated Spain in a war. There have been attempts to restore the Tagalog indigenous religion as the religion for the Tagalog people.

The territories where the ancient Tagalog pantheon was worshipped were the areas that were under Tagalog-majority influence prior to the biggest expansion of the [[Kingdom of Tondo]]. During that time, Hindu influences in customs and traditions were present due to trade with other Asian independent or vassal states. The first part as shown below are the residents of Kaluwalhatian (the abode of the gods, roughly corresponding to the [[Heaven in Christianity|Christian idea of Heaven]]). The term, ''anito'', has three meanings. The first is deity (gods and goddesses including Bathala and the lower deities living and not living in Kaluwalhatian. The second is non-ancestral spirits, the beings sent by Bathala along with the deities to aid mankind in everyday life. These non-ancestral spirit anitos can be formless or possess forms of various beings. The last is ancestral spirits, the souls of human beings who have passed on. These ancestral spirit anitos can also be summoned by Bathala to aid their relatives and descendants in special cases, usually through dreams or flickers of light. Aside from the anitos, there are also beings lower than them. These beings are diverse in forms and are considered as monsters (example is the aswang) and/or guardians (example is the tikbalang) that roam the world along with mankind. These beings usually reside within the confines of nature, but when disturbed, can inflicts severe damages to man and even cause death. Tagalogs who had spiritual prowess to contact the deities and anitos were known as ''katolanon''. The ''katolanon'', being the spiritual leader and personified contact to the deities, also assumed the role of the ''datu'' if the ''datu'' has not yet returned from his travels. He also acts as the ''datu'' during transition periods, where the official ''datu'' (leader) has yet to be chosen. Like the ''datu'', the ''katolanon'' may be male or female. Katolanon may choose to have a wife or husband as partner with his or her spiritual activities, regardless of gender. The ''katolanon'', male or female, usually has a female gender expression, according to Spanish accounts. The reason for this is because a female expression is the embodiment of natural spiritual balance, and is pleasing to the Tagalog deities. In times when certain barangays choose to establish a unification pact with other barangays, the datus of each barangay will vote among themselves who will be considered as the ''lakan'' (also known as punong datu), which is regarded as the head of all the datus within the pact. To establish the pact, a [[sandugo]] or blood compact is made. The katolanan of the datu, that was made into lakan, is also uplifted into the title of punong katalonan (head katolanan).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Sonia M. Zaide, Gregorio F.

| [[Bathala]]
| Sometimes referred as Abba, he is the supreme god of being; creator of man and earth and addressed sometimes as Bathalang Maykapal. He dwells in Kaluwalhatian together with the lesser gods and goddesses. Aside from the lesser gods and goddesses, he sent his anitos (ancestral spirits of mankind) in order to assist the daily lives of every human. He provided everything mankind needed, to a point where he spoiled them too much, hence, the Tagalog philosophy of ''bahala na'' (what comes will come, let it be). However, despite his intense kindness and love for mankind, he has also the capability to punish mankind through famine, diseases, and lightning. When he went into a deep slumber, he let Apolaki (his grandson who would later be known as his son) and Mayari (his daughter) rule in his place. This action led to the pre-colonial Tagalog notion that the younger generations also have the capability to become leaders. Many datus (community leaders) during the pre-colonial era were young men and women. In some accounts during the Spanish occupation, Bathala was not in deep slumber, but 'died' instead. This source is believed to have been crafted by Spanish friars so that Tagalogs at the time would stop believing in Bathala and would instead embrace the Christian God who the friars branded as 'undying', and therefore 'more powerful'. When most of the natives were converted to [[Christianity]] during the [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|Spanish era]], Bathala was referred interchangeably by many as the [[God|Christian God]], as the natives would not let his name be forgotten despite threats from the Spanish colonialists and friars. Researchers have suggested that Bathala's name is Hindu in origin as it comes from the Sanskrit word, [[Batara Guru|bhattara]], meaning noble lord. In Tagalog animism, the tigmamanukan omens (which can be a bird, lizard, or snake) were Bathala's emblems. In some accounts, Bathala chose the tigmamanukan creatures, especially the bird, as his messengers as they look like the bird form of his friend, Amihan, a primordial deity. A tigmamanukan omen bird was used by Bathala to split the bamboo that would let out the first man, Malakas, and woman, Maganda. The tigmamanukan omens were also used by Bathala to warn mankind if they should continue or discontinue their journey. If a traveler sees a [[tigmamanukan]] omen, and it passes from right to left, then it symbolizes as ''labay'' (Bathala's approval to proceed with the journey). If the tigmamanukan omen passes from left to right, the traveller should not proceed, or else he or she will never return. According to Tagalog elders, the tigmamanukan omen birds had blue strikes on their feathers and live in the mythical Mount Batala (a mountain dedicated to Bathala). According to research, the most probable bird species qualified as a tigmamanukan omen bird, as described by elders, is the fairy bluebird from the genus Irena.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leticia Ramos Shahani, Fe B. Mangahas, Jenny R. Llaguno|pp=27, 28, 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other children of Bathala include Hanan, Tala, Hangin, Kidlat, Tag-ani, Liwayway, and Bighari.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/rainbows-in-philippine-mythology-folklore/&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| Amanikable
| Originally, this god was worshipped as the god of hunters who provided good game to his worshippers. He gave titles to people who proved their prowess in hunting. In more modern stories he has become associated as the husky, ill-tempered god of the sea, replacing Aman Sinaya among of the first generation gods (aside from Bathala), he was never married after his love was spurned by a beautiful mortal maiden, Maganda, the first woman who was the partner of Malakas, the first man. Both came out from a bamboo that was pecked by Bathala's sacred bird, the tigmamanukan bird according to traditional Tagalog tales (but sometimes the sarimanok according to Tagalogs who migrated to the southern islands where the sarimanok is more known). In frustration, he swore vengeance against the humans by sending turbulent waves and horrible tempests in order to wreck boats and to drown men. Despite this, he is also wise and will help men if they earn his praise. This notion is in line with the dogma that Tagalog deities who are welcome in Kaluwalhatian are all kind. Amanikable has a cordial relationship with Haik, the sea god who brings peace to the sea, which is the opposite of Amanikable's sea prowess. In Tagalog animism, the hunter was Amanikable's emblem.&lt;ref name="harvnb|F. Landa Jocano"&gt;{{harvnb|F. Landa Jocano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Idiyanale
| Also known as Idianale or Idianali, she is the goddess of labor and good deeds. In some accounts, she is also a female deity of animal husbandry, and a male deity of agriculture. Natives used to call for her guidance in order to make their works successful. If a person does not call her name, the work being conducted may not be finished in time, not finished properly, or not finished at all. She is friends with the mischievous Bibit and medicine deity Lingga. She married Dimangan and had two offspring, namely, Dumakulem and Anitun Tabu. Her nature of needing to be considered was passed down to Anitun Tabu, while her nature o hard work was passed down to Dumakulem. In Tagalog animism, the water buffalo was Idiyanale's emblem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvnb|Leticia Ramos Shahani, Fe B. Mangahas, Jenny R. Llaguno|pp=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| Dimangan
| Also known as Dumangan, he is the sky god of good harvest. People offer him words of praise and respect to have a bountiful harvest and for the crops to yield better quality grains. In old tradition, singing songs for Dimangan is conducted to appease the god while harvesting the bounties he blessed on men. He has the capability to enhance the harvests of men with a wave of his hand. Because of this, he is praised together with Lakapati, who taught agriculture to mankind. He was married to Idiyanale and had two offspring, namely Dumakulem and Anitun Tabu. His nature of needing appeasement was passed down to Anitun Tabu, while his nature of giving aid to people was passed down to Dumakulem. In Sambal mythology, Dimangan had three brothers with equal strength as him, namely, Kalasakas, who hastened the ripening of rice stalks, Kalasokus, who was responsible for turning the grains from green to yellow, and Damulag, who protected the flowers of the rice plants from destructive hurricanes. In Tagalog polytheism, a basket of bounties was Dimangan's emblem.&lt;ref name="harvnb|F. Landa Jocano"/&gt;

| Lakapati
| The goddess of fertility and the most understanding and kind of all the deities. She was a hermaphrodite, having both male and female genitalia, symbolizing the balance of everything. Her bodily expression is notably feminine. Also known as Ikapati, She was the giver of food and prosperity. Her best gift to mankind was agriculture (cultivated fields), a reason why she is praised along with Dimangan, god of good harvest. Through her teachings, she was respected and loved by the people. She was known to be the kindest deity to the Tagalogs. Later, she married Mapulon, who courted her tirelessly. Her marriage with Mapulon was symbolic for the ancient Tagalogs as it referred to marriage as a mutual bond between two parties regardless of gender, which was common and an acceptable practice at the time. She had a daughter, named Anagolay who aided mankind when they have lost something or someone. During early Spanish rule, Lakapati was depicted as the Holy Spirit, as the people continued to revere her despite Spanish threats. In Tagalog animism, the small unhusked rice grain was Lakapati's emblem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
| First&lt;sup&gt;{{anchor|ref_E}}[[#endnote_E|'''[E]''']]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Mapulon
| The god of seasons. He also sometimes associated as a deity of good health and medicine. Mapulon is known as the second kindest deity to the Tagalogs, after Lakapati. He gave good seasons and health to mankind, and whenever a person is ill, medicinal herbs grow due to his prowess of commanding the seasons, providing men with something to heal themselves with. He fell in love with Lakapati due to Lakapati's kindness and understanding towards the people despite the mistakes made by mankind. At first, Lakapati was not interested with Mapulon, but eventually, Lakapati fell in love with him due to his tireless actions of love and they got married. Their story exemplifies why pre-colonial Tagalog men would court the person they love tirelessly for years, sometimes up to a decade, awaiting their loved one to fall in love with them as well through sheer determination. He had a daughter named Anagolay. Mapulon's emblem is undetermined.&lt;ref name="harvnb|F. Landa Jocano"/&gt;

|-
| [[Mayari]]
| The goddess of the moon, war, revolution, and right to equal rule. She is also associated with healing and lunar emotions. She is one of the three daughters of Bathala by a mortal woman. She was the most charming of all the goddesses, until one of her eyes were taken off by Apolaki in a battle. She has no hatred towards Apolaki, however, as the god did everything he could to make amends, though Mayari's eye was never healed. She had two sisters, Tala and Hanan, who she has very good ties with. In some stories, she became the ruler of the earth every night when her father Bathala was in a deep slumber, in contrast, Apolaki rules every day when Bathala was in deep slumber. In Tagalog polytheism, the moon was Mayari's emblem.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Sofronio G. Calderon"&gt;{{harvnb|Sofronio G. Calderon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| [[Tala (goddess)|Tala]]
| The goddess of the stars; sister of Mayari and Hanan and one of the three daughters of Bathala by a mortal woman. People looked up to her for direction during nighttime. Her light at night is said to guide men to safety, along with the extended aura of Anagolay. She is known to have supported the creation of the Tagalog constellations whose names have been forgotten due to the influx of Western names and depictions on constellations. Tala used light spheres or orbs to ferry men to safety at night, however, when the Spaniards came, they demonized the light orbs and called it [[santelmo]]s. The natives eventually regarded the santelmos as deadly beings that kill humans or get humans to lose their way. In Tagalog animism, the stars were Tala's emblem.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Sofronio G. Calderon"/&gt;

|-
| Hanan
| The goddess of morning; sister of Mayari and Tala and one of the three daughters of Bathala by a mortal woman. The first prayer of the day is given to Bathala, Apolaki, and her as a sign of a new day. She is specially important during the entrance of a new age or a new phase in a person's life. People offer her bountiful harvests and prayers during the birth of a child, the womanhood or manhood or a child, and the death of a person, entrance of the planting season, beginning of the harvest season, and start of a new annual cycle. These prayers are only conducted at the break of dawn. In Tagalog animism, the rooster and the dawning sun was Hanan's emblem.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Sofronio G. Calderon"/&gt;

|-
| Dumakulem
| The strong, agile guardian of mountains and the son of Idiyanale and Dimangan. He also known as a sky god. He aids people who get lost in the mountains. He hates people who destroys the mountain's forests and wildlife, however, he never intentionally strays people in mountains as he is a kind god, but he does not help those who destroy the mountains and excessively hunt wildlife. It is said that he creates mountains to shield the people from the terrible storms caused by his sister, Anitun Tabu. Because of this, sometimes earthquakes occur, signaling the creation of mountains. He is always in good terms with his sister as both love the good side of men. He later married Anagolay. In Tagalog polytheism, the mountain was Dumakulem's emblem.&lt;ref name="harvnb|F. Landa Jocano"/&gt;

| Anitun Tabu
| The fickle-minded goddess of wind and rain. Every time it rains (ambon) and suddenly stops, it is said that the happy Anitun Tabu is nearby. If a storm is present, the angry Anitun Tabu is nearby. Due to the association of the ambon as a presence of the happy Anitun Tabu, the event eventually became a good time for marriages, until eventually, the better time for marriage was changed to sunny showers. This belief on marriage every sunny showers have been diverted in the Spanish era as a marriage between supernatural beings, and thus, ceased to be practiced by the common Tagalog. In later stories, Anitun Tabu was also known to be a mediator between warring supernatural beings, as she was associated with sunny showers, a sacred peace pact for supernatural beings. She was the daughter of Idiyanale and Dimangan and the sister of Dumakulem. To the neighboring pre-colonial Sambal people in west Luzon, Anitun Tabu (or Aniton Tauo to them) is male, conflicting with the beliefs of pre-colonial Tagalogs. According to Sambal mythology, Aniton Tauo was the most revered deity for the Sambals, however, he eventually became full of himself, leading to Malayari (male Zambal counterpart of Mayari) to punish and oast him from supremacy. Afterwards, he became of the deities to assist Malayari in his tasks. The pinipig (punded young rice grains) is offered to the Tagalog Anitun Tabu. The ritual offering to her is called ''mamiarag''. In Tagalog animism, the rain was Anitun Tabu's emblem.&lt;ref name="harvnb|F. Landa Jocano"/&gt;
| Second
|-
| Anagolay
| The goddess of lost things and the only offspring of Lakapati and Mapulon. Pre-Hispanized Tagalogs sought Anagolay's guidance whenever something or someone is lost. It is said that Anagolay's aura is present in the very fabric of everything, the very reason why she can find things and persons that are lost. However, she had both traits of her parents, goodness and a wide view in equality. Due to this, she never uses her power to take advantage of anyone. She was secretly in love with Dumakulem prior to their marriage. Anitun Tabu, sister of Dumakulem, offered her aid in pursuing Dumakulem as the rain goddess approved of Anagolay. However, Anagolay humbly rejected the offer as she does not honor forced love. Later on, Dumakulem fell in love with Anagolay's care for mankind and courted her for years until they got married. In Tagalog animism, a hole of light was Anagolay's emblem.&lt;ref name="harvnb|F. Landa Jocano"/&gt;

|-
| Apolaki
| The god of sun, wisdom and strategy and the chief patron of warriors. He is also sometimes called as Araw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/rainbows-in-philippine-mythology-folklore/|title=Rainbows in Philippine Mythology &amp; Folklore|work=THE ASWANG PROJECT|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish accounts say he was ill-tempered, however, the Spanish used the image of the Greek god of war, [[Ares]]. In actual pre-colonial mythologies, Apolaki was a peaceful god who would fight for what he thinks was right and if he was wrong in the end, he would do his best to fix his wrong. This trait was exhibited during his battle with Mayari, where he apologized, after he put out one of Mayari's eyes, and agreed to Mayari's proposal for equal rights in ruling the earth. He was the son of Anagolay and Dumakulem. The neighboring pre-colonial Kapampangan people in central Luzon regarded Apolaki not a god of the sun as they already had one, but a goddess of the moon, conflicting with the pre-colonial Tagalog beliefs. During the Spanish occupation, reports surfaced where Apolaki came down from Kaluwalhatian and scolded some Tagalog folks for “welcoming men with white teeth”. The reports were passed on by the townsfolk to the parish priest, thus documenting the said event. During pre-colonial Tagalog times, having black-pigmented teeth was the aesthetics, while having white teeth was seen as disgusting and unbearable. In Tagalog polytheism, the sun was Apolaki's emblem.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Sofronio G. Calderon"/&gt;

|-
| Diyan Masalanta
| The goddess of love, conception and childbirth and the protector of lovers. She was in good relations with Ikapati, who presided over the fertility of mankind, the second stage to be determined after love and before conception. Sacrifices were offered to her so that conception is assured. She was the daughter of Anagolay and Dumakulem and youngest of all the deities. Spanish accounts imaged her like the Greek goddess of love, [[Aphrodite]], but in actual pre-colonial mythologies, she was of more motherly nature and had a high standard in family values. She is wise and has waged battles against evil spirits to protect the family from breaking apart. Her mortal enemy is Manisilat, the breaker of families. She viewed the family as a web of interlaced families and communities, which is exhibited in the Tagalog tradition of extended families. In Tagalog animism, the actual human heart and the child were Diyan Masalanta's emblems.

The list includes the god/goddess-like, residents of Kasamaan (Ancient Tagalog counterpart of [[Hell]]), which is known as a 'village of grief and afflication'. They were the evil entities all opposed to Bathala and the rest of his deities. Kasamaan, also known as Kasanaan, is also the place where the spirits of evil humans are sent. In contrast, the spirits of good humans are sent to Maca. But whether a person died evil or good, he or she is still given the ''pabaon'' ritual, where the dead is given gifts that he or she may use in his or her journey to Maca or Kasamaan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.filipiknow.net/philippine-mythology-gods-and-goddesses/#20-21_Haliya_and_the_Bakunawa&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| Sitan
| The guardian of Kasamaan and the keeper of all souls therein. He was depicted by the Spanish as the counterpart of Christianity's [[Satan]]. His real name has been lost in time. It is said that he came forth from nothing due to the evils of men, a story that symbolized the need of men to stay away from vices to not wake up the essence of Sitan. However, Sitan is not purely evil as he had aided mankind before, away from total annihilation, as he knows that a world without mankind is a world without his existence, and therefore, the destruction of Kasamaan, one of the dwellings of Tagalog anitos (ancestral spirits). He had four agents whose task was to lead man to sin and destruction, but also to aid those who are worthy of Sitan's help. According to another research, Sitan's name may have been derived from Saitan or Shaitan, the ruler of the Islamic underworld. This data concluded that during the Islamic era of the Tagalog domains, the original name of Sitan was replaced by the Islamic name already, making it impossible to determine the true indigenous name of Sitan. Sitan's emblem was a veil of darkness.&lt;ref name="harvnb|F. Landa Jocano"/&gt;
|-
| Manggagaway
| She was the first agent of Sitan and was primarily blamed as the cause of diseases. Sometimes, she would change herself into a human form, appearing as a false healer. If she wished to kill someone, she employed a sacred stick, veiled with the prowess of diseases. She can also prolong one's death for weeks or months by binding a snake, with a personally-concocted potion inside it, around the dying person's waist. She can be sent back to Kasamaan through the guidance of Bathala and the other gods of Kaluwalhatian or through the order of Sitan. Manggagaway's emblem was her sacred stick.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thelma B. Kintanar, Jose V. Abueva |pp=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Manisilat
| Also known as Mansisilat. The second agent of Sitan, she was tasked to destroy and break every happy and united family that she could find. She does this by transforming herself into a beggar or healer going inside the house of couples. Once inside, she infuses magic inside the home until the couples magically get agitated with the presence of one another, uwhich eventually leads to separation. She was the mortal enemy of Diyan Masalanta, who prioritized the protection of the family and its extensions. She can be sent back to Kasamaan through the guidance of Bathala and the other gods of Kaluwalhatian or through the order of Sitan. Manisilat's emblem is the torn family.&lt;ref name="harvnb|F. Landa Jocano"/&gt;
|-
| Mangkukulam
| The only male agent of Sitan, he was to emit fire at night and when there was bad weather. Fires caused during bad weather are associated with him as Anitun Tabu only causes wind and rain, not fire from lightning. Like his fellow agents, he could change his form to that of a healer and then induce fire at his victim's house. If the fire were extinguished immediately, the victim would eventually die. To extinguish the fire, prayers to Anitun Tabu is made so that it will rain and extinguish Mangkukulam's fire. His name literally means [[Mangkukulam|witch]]. He can be sent back to Kasamaan through the guidance of Bathala and the other gods of Kaluwalhatian or through the order of Sitan. Mangkukulam's emblem is the fire.&lt;ref name="harvnb|F. Landa Jocano"/&gt;
|-
|Hukluban
|The last agent of Sitan could change herself into any form she desired. She can kill or make people unconscious simply by greeting them. She could also kill someone by simply raising her hand and could heal without any difficulty as she wished. Because of this, frustrated men have consulted her to heal various diseases, however, she never lets her have the smaller part of the bargain. Although, she can also give healing to men without a huge exchange if she deems the person as worthy of Sitan's aid. She taught some medicinal practices to mankind for no apparent reason. Her name literally means "crone" or "hag." She can also make things happen by uttering sorcery. She can be sent back to Kasamaan through the guidance of Bathala and the other gods of Kaluwalhatian or through the order of Sitan. Hukluban's emblem is death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thelma B.

==== Other Tagalog deities ====

The list includes the gods and goddesses who don't have a unified pantheon within the Tagalog deities mentioned in Table #1. Many of following deities live with mankind in the middle world, except for the children of Bathala.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/rainbows-in-philippine-mythology-folklore/&lt;/ref&gt;

! Name
! God(dess) of 
|-
| Aman Sinaya 
| He was the primordial god of the ocean and protector of fishermen. He was one of the five original deities along with Bathala, Amihan, and the two first deities met by Bathala. He sent tempests into the heavens, to which Bathala responded by throwing boulders which would become the Philippine Islands. Amihan flew back and forth between them, making peace. Later, these islands will be large enough for men to thrive when Bathala's tigmamanukan (sacred bird) would fly over them and the sea. In later stores, the title of the god of the sea was given to Haik, and later, Amanikable as well, however, the two gods had different approaches in ruling the waters. Aman Sinaya rested beneath his realms afterwards and continue to safeguard men at sea through his essence, which sometimes guide men through inner calls. People called upon him for a good catch of fish or other river or marine animals. Fisherfolks also call him when first wetting a net or fishhook. Some accounts depict Aman Sinaya as a female deity, although the majority of accounts depict the deity as male. He had a son named Sinaya. His emblem is the tempest.
|-
| Amihan
| A genderless deity who was the friend of both Bathala and Aman Sinaya. In some accounts, they are depicted as a bird, in others, they are depicted as a god who can transform into a bird similar to the [[tigmamanukan]]. They were the god of the space between the sea and the sky during the time that land and men were not yet created. When Bathala and Aman Sinaya waged a war, Amihan intervened and forged a pact of peace between the two. Because of this, Amihan is regarded as the deity of peace. Amihan continued to live at the space between the sea and the sky, even after the creation of land and humans and the ascension of some deities to Kaluwalhatian. Amihan was offered a place in Kaluwalhatian but they rejected Bathala's offer calmly, knowing that accepting the offer would stir negative sentiments from Aman Sinaya. Amihan's emblem is a small common bird.
|-
| Ulilang Kaluluwa (Orphaned Spirit)
| The serpent god present in some creation myths. During the start of time, both Bathala and Ulilang Kaluluwa thought they were the only beings in the world. One day, they encountered each other by accident, surprised in finding out that they were not the only beings in the world. Eventually, they learned that both of them wanted the world for themselves. In anger, Ulilang Kaluluwa challenged Bathala over the title of ruler of everything. By the end of the battle, Ulilang Kaluluwa was killed by Bathala and then burned into ashes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;{{harvnb|Leticia Ramos Shahani, Fe B. Mangahas, Jenny R. Llaguno|pp=27, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Galang Kaluluwa (Wandering Spirit)
| The winged god present in some creation myths who loves to travel. Initially, Galang Kaluluwa thought that he was the only being in the world, until he met Bathala, During that time, Bathala has already defeated Ulilang Kaluluwa. Unlike Ulilang Kaluluwa, Galang Kaluluwa became good friends with Bathala, to the point that Bathala welcomed Galang Kaluluwa into his home on the very first day they met. Unfortunetely, after many years of being together, Galang Kaluluwa died from a terrible disease even Bathala did not manage to cure. Before his death, he told Bathala to burn his lifeless body on top of the ashes of Ulilang Kaluluwa, which was the only mass on top of the sea during that time. Bathala did just that, and from the ashes of Ulilang Kaluluwa and Galang Kaluluwa, the coconut tree grew, becoming the first vegetation made. The coconut tree's leaves reminded Bathala of his friend, while the hard, unattractive trunk reminded him of his bitter enemy. When Bathala finally decided to create mankind from the bamboo as land had already been made years before during Bathala's battle with Aman Sinaya, he used the coconut tree to provide mankind's first home and the coconut as the first source of mankind's nutrients.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;
|-
| Sinaya
| Sinaya is the only child of Aman Sinaya, who he was named after. Sinaya is an extraordinary inventor. Despite inventing many things, his most praised invention was the fish gear which helped mankind catch more fish. Because of this, he is much revered by Tagalog fisherfolks and their families. The primary reason for the Tagalog peopele's love of his fish gear invention was because the majority of pre-colonial Tagalogs were fisherfolks or had lineage from fisherfolks.
|-
| Haik
| God of the sea who is called upon by seamen in a major ceremony dedicated to him, asking for fair weather and favorable winds. He clears troubled waters so that men will have a safe voyage. Due to this, he sometimes have confrontations with Amanikable, the purveyor of troubled waters. Haik, despite being a kind god, is not welcome in Kaluwalhatian because of his confrontations with Amanikable. He has contacts with Aman Sinaya. His emblem is the undisturbed water.
|-
| Lakambakod
| The protector of the growing crops and the god of protections.&lt;ref name="harvnb|F. Landa Jocano"/&gt; He was invoked to keep animals out of swiddens. Pre-Hispanic images of him had gilded genitals "as long as a rice stalk". He was offered eels when fencing swiddens because natives believed that fences he blessed were the strongest of all fences. In later accounts, pre-colonial Tagalogs offered him bounties and prayers as well in the construction of palisades and anything related to defence. His emblem is the fence.
|-
| Lakambini
| He is known as the "pure maiden" for his incomparable beauty, ironic that he is a male diwata who later became a deity. He was originally known as the god of "kapurihan" (purity) and is also the god of food, festivity and anti-gluttony. Worshiped mainly by men, they pray to him to let them find a beautiful maiden to wed. Because of this, he has good relations with the goddess of love, Diyan Masalanta, who he secretly admires. He had the power to cure throat ailments, which he used to heal Diyan Masalanta before. During the Spanish occupation, the friars told the Tagalogs that Lakambini was an obscure deity called "abogado dela garganta" (throat advocate) and was a god of gluttony as he wanted the Holy Spirit (depicted at the time as Diyan Masalanta) for himself. Tagalogs who continued to revere Lakambini were tortured by the Spanish to completely convert into Christianity and demonize Lakambini. Lakambini's emblem is the male human.
|-
| Lingga
| A phallic god and partner of Bibit. Like Bibit, he used to cause illness if not recognised in daily activities. Later stories tell that for some reason, he had a change of heart. He then became the god who was responsible for curing diseases, hence a deity of medicines. He has no definite emblem.
|-
| Bibit
| A phallic god and partner of Linga. He caused illness if not given recognised in the ordinary course of daily activities. When Lingga shifted into a god of medicine, he continued to cause illness to people who do not recognize his existence in every day life. He has no definite emblem.
|-
| Uwinan Sana
| The godly guardian of grasslands or forests. He is acknowledged by the Tagalogs as overlord of grasslands and forests whenever entering them, to avoid being regarded as trespassers. When Christianity was introduced by the Spanish, this tradition of acknowledging supernatural beings as owners of grasslands and forests was inputted towards dwarf-like creatures called nuno and dwende. He is a good friend of Dumakulem, god of the mountains, who he is very fond of. His emblem is the humble leaf.
|-
| Mankukutod
| The god and the protector of coconut palms, highly priced crops during pre-colonial times as it was the first vegetation made and the first tree used by Bathala to aid mankind in building shelter and gaining food. Mankukutod's role as god of the coconut palms was granted by Bathala, as he knew that Mangkukutod will safeguard the descendants of Galang Kaluluwa's essence and will keep still the essence of Bathala's enemy. He is given an offering by [[Palm wine|Tubâ]] (palm wine) tappers before climbing a tree, lest they fall from the trunk and hurt themselves. He is a good friend to the Idinayale and Lakapati. His emblem is the coconut tree. He is also sometimes associated as a descendant of the essence of Galang Kaluluwa and Ulilang Kaluluwa, and grew from the very first coconut palm.
|-
| Meylupa
| A [[Corvus|crow]] god who is the master of the earth, between the underworld and Kaluwalhatin, excluding the waters. He is the most powerful of the gods who reside in the middle world's earth realms, aside from Amihan, the only primordial deity who lives in the middle world. It is unknown where his true residence is. Like Bathala, he also has birds that serve him in the form of crows. His emblem is the crow.
|-
| Silagan
| His duty is to tempt people and to eat the liver of all those who wear white clothes during mourning and take their souls down to the depth of Kasanaan. This was the reason the ancient Tagalogs usually wore vari-colored tapis or barrel skirts.
|-
| Mananangal
| The sister of Silagan. She could be seen walking along dark trails and lonely paths without her head, hands or feet, because her work was to frighten people to death. Due to her bodily configurations, her name was also chosen as the name of a race of creatures with similar body configurations.
|-
| Bighari
| The flower-loving daughter of [[Bathala]] who was the goddess of the [[rainbow]] and known for her tardiness. A story tells that she was cursed by her father to stay on earth forever because of her failure to attend a family council in Kaluwalhatian on time. It is her arch of multicolored flowers that we see in the sky and call ''bahaghari'' (“Rainbow” in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/rainbows-in-philippine-mythology-folklore/&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Liwayway
| A daughter of Bathala who represented the dawn. Hanan, goddess of the morning, is sometimes associated as Liwayway herself, although some accounts note that they are different as Liwayway's mother is not mentioned as a mortal woman, unlike Hanan. Very little is known about Liwayway, as Hanan is more worshiped during pre-colonial times. She was noted for her strict obedience to Bathala.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/rainbows-in-philippine-mythology-folklore/&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Tag-ani
| A daughter of Bathala who was a harvest deity. Very little is known about her as there are other agricultural deities with larger followings in the Tagalog pantheon.

|-
| Hangin
| A son of Bathala who was the god of wind. He does not have much of a following as Anitun Tabu, goddess of wind and rain, is more worshiped in precolonial times. Hangin was noted for his strict obedience to Bathala.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/rainbows-in-philippine-mythology-folklore/&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, everything in nature is considered as sacred in Tagalog mythology, from caves, rivers, seas, lakes, mountains, trees, wind, sky, and so on. Other sacred sites also include Tagalog places of death (ancient cemeteries), and temples (usually in the form of forts or enlarged huts with palisades). Usually, these sites are areas where the deities frequent, and thus serve as both a place of worship and a place for recharging the body and a person's amulet, known as anting-anting. The sites are also usually home to certain anitos (not diwatas, as research has concluded{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} that the term diwata was used by the pre-colonial Visayans and Ibalons, not the pre-colonial Tagalogs) or the ancestral spirits and spirits sent by Bathala to aid mankind. The following are traditionally considered as the most sacred, and still are, among the sites:

*[[Taal Lake]]
*Mount Cristobal - Sacred as a place for evil spirits, which should also be respected.
*[[Mount Banahaw]] - Sacred as a place for good spirits, notably the helpers of Bathala.
*[[Mount Makiling]] - Sacred as a place for good spirits, notably the [[anito]], [[Maria Makiling]].
*Southern [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] - Sacred as it is “near the sky”, and thus near to Kaluwalhatian.
*[[Laguna de Bay]] - The largest lake in the Philippines, and the main lake of the Tagalog people.
*[[Pasig River]] - The pathway of the ancient Tagalogs from freshwater into sea.
*[[Mount Arayat]] - A mountain in northeast Pampanga, which is also sacred to the Kapampangan people.
*[[Marinduque]] - The mountains of Marinduque and the caves of Bathala.
*Several ancient ruins - Several ancient ruins are sacred to the Tagalog people such as the [[Limestone tombs of Kamhantik]] at [[Mulanay|Mulanay, Quezon]] and the ruins at [[Santa Ana, Manila]].
*Several cave sites

Depicted as tall,muscular with silver hair, He once resided in Kamurayan or heavens but left to reside in Mt. Mayon, in his place he placed Bulan in the heavens with the wind people. He is the symbol of the good (an mga marhay) ready to punish the bad (an mga maraot). When the people saw fire (calayo) flowing out of the crater of Mayon, they would grow afraid. They would then offer a sacrifice (atang) to him to appease his wrath. The Baliana, priestess, officiated in the ceremony. Always when they committed wrong, there would be loud moaning of the earth followed by an eruption of fire and lava.&lt;ref name="aswangproject.com"&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/ancient-bikolano-deities-in-philippine-mythology/&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Bikolanos had a rite performed for him called Atang.&lt;ref name="ourownvoice.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourownvoice.com/tales/tales2004a-2.shtml |title=Asuang Steals Fire from Gugurang by Damiana L.

Even though he is considered a dark and evil god and of all the beast, he is a fried of the boy Bulan (god of the moon) the two are worshiped side by side by the cross-dressing priests called "Baylan". It is said that on the first time Asuang and Bulan met, the moonlight was heavily lit, causing to show Asuang's true form. Instead of being horrified, the comely god Bulan did not waver. Bulan befriended Asuang, not because Asuang was monstrous, but just because he wanted to.

He has deep affection towards Magindang, but plays with him by running away so that Magindang would never catch him. The reason for this is because he is shy to the man that he loves. If Magindang manages to catch Bulan, Haliya always comes to free him from Magindang's grip. There is a story concerning Bulan and the takay flower, that the moon god saw a lovely maiden drown and made her into the "takay" flower or the Bicolano water-hyacinth.&lt;ref name="aswangproject.com"/&gt;

She transformed into a huge eel-like dragon (some say dragon with gills with the mouth the size of a lake). As the devourer of the sun and the moon, she became an adversary of Haliya as Bakunawa's main aim is to swallow Bulan, who Haliya swore to protect for all of eternity. During eclipses (where bakunawa tries to swallow Bulan), the people would light torches to make notice to invoke Bakunawa's rival Haliya. Haliya, is portrayed to always hear the people's voices in those times, and comes to always rescue Bulan successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/181693/eclipse-bakunawa-eats-the-sun-behind-a-curtain-of-clouds|title=GMANews: Eclipse; Bakunawa eats the sun behind a curtain of clouds|accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aswangproject.com"/&gt;

===Ilongot Deities===

*'''Abal''' – He and his brother Cain are the creators and guardian lords of all things. They are benevolent and their particular care is that of the people who live on earth. They are invincible and live in the sky Taon, sometimes on the sun Elag, or the moon Dalan, or perchance some star Pandac. Their messengers are called Binangunan or Cabuligian. Cain and Abal travel from place to place. Their road is called Keat (lightning). Kidu (thunder) follows the road. In the beginning, Cain and Abal lived together in the sky; but they had a quarrel and separated, as Abal wanted to live on earth where he could herd his animals. He was the one who created the lowlanders, who have the use of his carabaos and other animals.
*'''Cain''' - Created all the mountain people, including the Ilongots. He gave them their customs, which they have followed throughout the centuries.

The last dog to be passed through the smoke is the leader of the pack. After taking it out of the smoke, the owner spits on its face, and rubs the saliva down its back and sides. Meanwhile, he has been talking and shouting to Gemang, saying: "Do not let our dogs get sick. You must give us one of your animals. Do not take the form of a wild beast so that the dogs chase you by mistake. If you will let the dogs catch one beast, then we will give you to eat and drink and likewise your wife." Following this ceremony, the part starts out in a successful hunt.

== List of famous diwatas ==

{{Main|Diwata}}
Aside from the gods and goddesses, ancient Filipinos also worshiped numerous forest deities known as [[diwata]]s ([[Filipino people|Filipinos]] counterpart of [[nymph]]s/enchanter or enchantress). There is a multitude of diwatas in the [[Philippine mythology]] and [[Philippine Folklore|folklore]], but this section includes only the list of well-known.

| Malina/[[Maria Makiling]]
| The most famous of all the enchantress in the [[Philippine mythology]] and [[Philippine Folklore|folklore]]. She was the protector and guardian of [[Mount Makiling]] located in [[Los Baños, Laguna]]. Thus, modern sightings of her were even reported. Maria Makiling is a common subject among Filipino artists, ranging from painters and sculptors to [[Graphic Novel|graphic novelists]]. Prior to the conversion of the natives to Christianity, Maria Makiling was already known as ''Makiling'', an anito sent by Bathala in Mount Makiling to aid mankind in their daily tasks. The 'Maria' was added by the Spanish in a bid to 'rebrand' her as Catholic and to further subjugate the natives into Spanish imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philsites.net/folklore/stories/legend1.html|title=The Legend of Maria Makiling retold by Gat Jose Rizal|accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Maria Sinukuan]]
| She was the resident and protector of [[Mount Arayat]] located in [[Arayat]], [[Pampanga]]. Prior to Spanish colonization, Sinukuan was known as a powerful male Kapampangan god, named Aring Sinukûan, who was in par with the Kapampangan god of Pinatubo, Apûng Malyari. The two were the second most powerful deities in Kampampangan mythology, next only to Mangechay (sometimes called Mangacha), the great elder and creator goddess. Aring Sinukûan was the sun god of war and death, taught the early inhabitants the industry of metallurgy, wood cutting, rice culture and waging war. He had three children, namely, Munag Sumalâ, the golden serpent god who represent dawn, Lakandanup, the god of gluttony who represented the sun at noon time, and Gatpanapun, the noble god who only knew pleasure and represented the afternoon. He also had a winged assistant named Galurâ, a giant eagle deity believed to be the bringer of storms, and a wife named Mingan. However, when the Spanish arrived, they 'rebranded' Sinukuan as a woman, thinking that the people would not revere the deity if he was a female, not knowing that the great elder deity of the Kapampangan was a woman named Mangechay. Additionally, Sinukuan's wife, Mingan, was rebranded as 'male'. Despite this, the natives continued to revere Sinukuan. Furious, the Spanish added 'Maria' to Sinukuan's name to somewhat turn her into Catholic in a bid to further subjugate the natives and convert them into Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arayat2012.tripod.com/maria.htm|title=The Legend of Maria Sinukuan|accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/11314629/Myths_and_Legends_of_Pinatubo_and_Arayat&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Maria Cacao]]
| She dwells in [[Mount Lantoy]], [[Argao, Cebu]] where she had [[Theobroma cacao|cacao trees]], hence a plantation outside her own cave. After harvest, rain comes that wash down the mountain, enabling her to float down to the towns below in her golden ship to sell her products. The original name of the Maria Cacao is unknown as it was not recorded before the Spanish subjugated her name in a bid to instill Roman Catholicisms to the natives. But it is widely assumed her name is not indigenous as 'Cacao' is an imported term that came from Latin America when the Spanish arrived. Additionally, the term 'Maria' was added by the Spanish to turn her into 'Catholic', in a bid to widen Spanish rule in southern Cebu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rene O. Villanueva}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Diwata ng Kagubatan (''Enchantress of the Forest'')
| She was worshiped by the ancient [[Cuyunon]] people, an ethnic group that predominantly lives in the [[Cuyo Archipelago]] and nearby areas such as northern [[Palawan]] and [[Antique]]. As the most powerful of the supernatural Cuyonon beings, she is honored in a celebrated feast, periodically held atop of Mount Caimana in [[Cuyo, Palawan|Cuyo Island]]. When most of the natives were converted to [[Christianity]] during the [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|Spanish Era]], about 2/3 of the converted Cuyunon were still celebrating her feast, angering the Spanish imperialists. The situation led the Spanish authorities to intensify their evangelization and governance efforts, which included the forced Roman Catholic conversion of the Cuyonon people, burning of houses of non-Catholic Cuyonons, and massive slavery. Later, the Spanish called Diwata ng Kagubatan as Virgen Del Monte, in another bid to rebrand the deity as 'Catholic'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litera1no4.tripod.com/cuyunon_frame.html|title=Cuyunon Island by Lydia Mary De Leon|accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The numerous '''[[epithet]]s of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]''' indicate the importance and variety of the god's cult in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]].

==Capitoline cult==
Jupiter's most ancient attested forms of cult are those of the state. The most important of his sanctuaries in Rome were located on the [[Capitoline Hill]] ''(Mons Capitolinus)'', earlier ''Tarpeius''. The Mount had two peaks, each devoted to acts of cult related to Jupiter. The northern and higher peak was the citadel ''([[Arx (Roman)|arx]]).'' On the ''arx'' was located the observation place of the [[augurs]] (the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auguraculum|auguraculum]])'', to which the monthly procession of the ''sacra Idulia'' was directed.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa p. 108 citing Varro LL V 47and Festus p. 290 M. s.v. Idulia.&lt;/ref&gt; On the southern peak was the most ancient sanctuary of the god, traditionally said to have been built by [[Romulus]]: this was the shrine of  ''[[Feretrius|Iuppiter Feretrius]]'', which was restored by [[Augustus]]. The god here had no image and was represented by the sacred flintstone (''silex'').&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa p. 108 citing Paulus p. 92 M.; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VIII 641.&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient known rites, those of the ''[[spolia opima]]'' and of the [[fetials]], connect Jupiter with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Quirinus]], and are dedicated to ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' or ''[[Iuppiter Lapis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa p. 108 citing Festus p. 189 M. s.v. lapis; Polybius ''Historiae'' III 25, 6. According to Wissowa and Dumézil, ''Iuppiter Lapis'' seems to be inseparable from ''Iuppiter Feretrius'', in whose tiny shrine on the Capitol the ''silex'' was lodged.&lt;/ref&gt; From this earliest period, the concept of the [[sky god]] encompassed the ethical and political domain.

==Lightning and rain==
''Juppiter Tonans'' ("Thundering Jove") was the aspect (''numen'') of Jupiter venerated in the '''Temple of Juppiter Tonans''', which was vowed in 26 BCE  by [[Augustus]] and dedicated in 22 on the [[Capitoline Hill]]; the Emperor had narrowly escaped being struck by lightning during the campaign in [[Cantabria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Vita Augusti'' 29.91, etc. See Samuel Ball Platner and Thomas Ashby, ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome,'' (London: Oxford University Press) 1929. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Aedes_Jovis_Tonantis.html On-line text])&lt;/ref&gt; An old temple in the [[Campus Martius]] had long been dedicated to Juppiter Fulgens. The original [[cult image]] installed in the sanctuary by its founder was by [[Leochares]],&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Pliny's Natural History]], 39.79&lt;/ref&gt; a Greek sculptor of the 4th century BCE. The sculpture at the [[Prado]] is considered to be a late 1st-century replacement commissioned by [[Domitian]]. The Baroque-era restoration of the arms gives Jupiter a baton-like scepter in his raised hand.

Among Jupiter's most ancient epithets is ''Lucetius'', interpreted as referring to light ''(lux, lucis)'', specifically sunlight, by ancient and some modern scholars such as Wissowa.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Carmen Saliare]]'', however, indicates that it refers to lightning.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ARR It. tr. Milan 1977 p. 167. The ''carmen Saliare'' has: "cume tonas Leucesie prai ted tremonti/ quot tibi etinei deis cum tonarem" ("When you thunder, oh God of light, they tremble before you! All gods beneath you have heard you thunder!")&lt;/ref&gt; To the same atmospheric complex belongs the epithet ''Elicius'': while the ancient erudites thought it was connected to lightning, it is in fact related to the opening of the rervoirs of rain, as is testified by the ceremony of the ''Nudipedalia'', meant to propitiate rainfall and devoted to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Petronius ''Satyricon'' 44.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ritual of the ''[[lapis manalis]]'', the stone which was brought into the city through the [[Porta Capena]] and carried around in times of drought, which was named ''Aquaelicium''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus  s. v. p. 94 L 2nd; p. 2  M; Tertullian ''Apologeticum'' 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early epithets connected with the amospheric quality of Jupiter are ''Pluvius'', ''Imbricius'', ''Tempestas'', ''Tonitrualis'', ''tempestatium divinarum potens'', ''Serenator'', ''Serenus''&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius ''DeMundo'' 37; cf. ''Iuppiter Serenus'' CIL VI 431, 433,; XI  6312;  ''Iuppiter Pluvialis'' CIL XI 324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iuppiter Serenus'' has been recognized as an ''interpretatio'' of the Phocean god Ζευς Ούριος: F. Cenerini above  p. 104 citing Giancarlo Susini "Iuppiter Serenus e altri dei" in ''Epigraphica'' '''33''' 1971 p. 175-177.&lt;/ref&gt; and, referred to lightning, ''Fulgur'',&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius I 2, 5; CIL I 2nd  p. 331: sanctuary in the Campus Martius, dedicated on October 7 according to calendaries.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fulgur Fulmen'',&lt;ref&gt;CIL XII 1807.&lt;/ref&gt; later as nomen agentis  ''Fulgurator'', ''Fulminator'':&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 377; III 821, 1596, 1677, 3593, 3594, 6342  cited by Wissowa above p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; the high antiquity of the cult is testified by the neutre form ''Fulgur'' and the use of the term for the ''bidental'', the lightningwell dug on the spot hit by a lightningbolt.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s. v. provorsum fulgur p. 229 M: "...; itaque Iovi Fulguri et Summano fit, quod diurna Iovis nocturna Summani fulgura habentur." as cited by Wissowa above p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture and war==
A group of epithets has been interpreted by Wissowa (and his followers) as a reflection of the agricultural or warring nature of the god, some of which are also in the list of eleven preserved by Augustine.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' (herafter CD) VII 11. ''Pecunia'' is tentatively included in this group by Wissowa above p. 105 n.  4. Cfr. Augustine CD VII 11 end and 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Frugifer'' CIL XII 336. Apuleius ''De Mundo'' 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The agricultural ones include ''Opitulus'', ''Almus'', ''Ruminus'', ''Frugifer'',  ''Farreus'',  ''Pecunia'', ''Dapalis'',&lt;ref&gt;Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' 132; Paulus s. v. p. 51 M.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Epulo''.&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 3696.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine gives an explanation of the ones he lists which should reflect Varro's: ''Opitulus'' because he brings ''opem'' (means, relief) to the needy, ''Almus'' because he nourishes everything, ''Ruminus'' because he nourishes  the living beings by breastfeeding them, ''Pecunia'' because everything belongs to him.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa above  p. 105  n. 4 understands ''Pecunia'' as protector and increaser of the flock.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil maintains the cult usage of these epithets is not documented and that the epithet ''Ruminus'', as Wissowa and Latte remarked, may not have the meaning given by Augustine but it should be understood as part of a series including  ''Rumina'', '' Ruminalis ficus'', ''Iuppiter Ruminus'', which bears the name of Rome itself with an Etruscan vocalism  preserved in inscriptions, series that would be preserved in the sacred language (cf. ''Rumach'' Etruscan for Roman). However many scholars have argued that the name of  Rome, ''Ruma'', meant in fact woman's breast.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Migliorini s.v. Roma in ''Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti'' vol. XXIX p. 589; A. W. Schlegel ''Sämtliche Werke'' Leipzig 1847 XII p. 488; F. Kort ''Römische Geschichte'' Heidelberg 1843 p.32-3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diva Rumina]], as Augustine testifies in the cited passage, was the goddess of suckling babies: she was venerated near the ''ficus ruminalis'' and was offered only libations of milk.&lt;ref&gt;N. G. L. Hammond &amp; H. H. Scullard (Eds.) ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'' Oxford 1970 s. v. p. 940.&lt;/ref&gt; Here moreover Augustine cites the verses devoted to Jupiter by [[Quintus Valerius Soranus]],  while hypothesising ''Iuno'' (more adept in his view as a breastfeeder), i. e. Rumina instead of Ruminus, might be nothing else than  ''Iuppiter'': ''Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque Progenitor genetrixque deum...''.

In Dumézil's opinion ''Farreus'' should be understood as related to the rite of the ''confarreatio'' the most sacred form of marriage, the name of which is due to the spelt cake eaten by the spouses, rather than surmising an agricultural quality of the god: the epithet means the god was the guarantor of the effects of the ceremony, to which the presence of his flamen is necessary and that he can interrupt with a clap of thunder.&lt;ref&gt;Servius IV 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

The epithet ''Dapalis'' is on the other hand connected to a rite described by Cato and mentioned by Festus.&lt;ref&gt;Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' 132; Festus s. v. daps, dapalis, dapaticum p. 177-8 L 2nd.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the sowing of autumn or spring the peasant offered a banquet of roast beef and a cup of wine to Jupiter : it is natural that on such occasions he would entreat the god who has power over the weather, however  Cato' s  prayer of s one of sheer offer and no request. The language suggests another attitude: Jupiter is invited to a banquet which is supposedly abundant and magnificent. The god is honoured as ''summus''. The peasant may hope he shall receive a benefit, but he does not say it. This interpretation  finds support in the analogous urban ceremony of  the ''epulum Iovis'', from which the god derives the epithet of  ''Epulo''  and which was a magnificent feast accompanied by flutes.&lt;ref&gt;''Epulo'' CIL VI 3696.&lt;/ref&gt;

Epithets related to warring are in Wissowa' s view  ''Iuppiter Feretrius'', ''Iuppiter Stator'', ''Iuppiter Victor'' and ''Iuppiter Invictus''.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa above p. 105-108.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Feretrius'' would be connected with war by the rite of the first type of  ''[[spolia opima]]'' which is in fact a dedication to the god of the arms of the defeated king of the enemy that happens whenever he has been killed by the king of Rome or his equivalent authority. Here too Dumézil notes the dedication has to do with regality and not with war, since the rite is in fact the offer of the arms of a king by a king:  a proof of such an assumption is provided by the fact that the arms of an enemy king captured by an officer or a common soldier were dedicated to Mars and Quirinus respectively.

''Iuppiter Stator'' was first attributed by tradition to Romulus, who pledged to build a [[Temple of Jupiter Stator (8th century BC)|temple]] in his honor in exchange for his almighty help at a critical moment in the final [[Battle of the Lacus Curtius|battle]] of the war with [[Titus Tatius|King Titus Tatius]] of the [[Sabines]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 12, 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch, ''[[Parallel Lives|Life of Romulus]]'' ch.8 pg.7&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil opines the action of Jupiter is not that of a god of war who wins through fighting: Jupiter acts by causing an inexplicable change in the morale of the fighters of the two sides. The same feature can be detected also in the certainly historical record of the battle of the third Samnite War in 294 BC, in which consul [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] vowed a temple to ''Iuppiter Stator'' if "Jupiter will stop the rout of the Roman army and if afterwards the Samnite legions shall be victouriously massacred...It looked as if the gods themselves had taken side with Romans, so much easily did the Roman arms succeed in prevailing...".&lt;ref&gt;Livy X 36, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil above It. tr. p. 174-5.&lt;/ref&gt; in a similar manner one can explain the epithet ''Victor'', whose cult was founded in 295 BC on the battlefield of [[Sentinum]] by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges]] and who received another vow again in 293 by consul [[Lucius Papirius Cursor]] before a battle against the Samnite ''legio linteata''. Here too the religious meaning of the vow is in both cases  an appeal to the supreme god by the Roman chief at a time when as a chief  he needs divine help from the supreme god, even though for different reasons: Fabius had remained the only political and military responsible of the Roman State after the ''devotio'' of P. Decius Mus, Papirius had to face an enemy who had acted with impious rites and vows, i. e. was religiously reprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;Livy X 29, 12-17; ''nefando sacro, mixta hominum pecudumqur caedes'', "by an impious rite, a mixed slaughter of people and flock" 39, 16; 42, 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Dario Sabbatucci has given a different interpretation of the meaning of ''Stator'' within the frame of his structuralistic and dialectic vision of Roman calendar, identifying oppositions, tensions and equilibria: January is the month of [[Janus]], at the beginning of the year, in the uncertain time of winter (the most ancient calendar had only ten months, from March to December). In this month Janus deifies kingship and defies Jupiter. Moreover January sees also the presence of [[Veiovis]] who appears as an anti-Jupiter, of [[Carmenta]] who is the goddess of birth and like Janus has two opposed faces, ''Prorsa'' and ''Postvorta'' (also named [[Antevorta]] and [[Antevorta|Porrima]]), of [[Iuturna]], who as a gushing spring evokes the process of coming into being from non-being as the god of passage and change does. In this period the preeminence of Janus needs compensating on the Ides through the action of Jupiter ''Stator'', who plays the role of anti-Janus, i. e. of moderator of the action of Janus.&lt;ref&gt;Dario Sabbatucci above, as summarized in the review by Robert Turcan above p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jupiter outside Rome==

===Iuppiter Latiaris===
The cult of ''Iuppiter Latiaris'' was the most ancient known cult of the god : it was practised since  very remote times on the top of the ''Mons Albanus'' on which the god was venerated as the high protector of the Latin League, which was under the hegemony of Alba Longa.

After the destruction of Alba  by king Tullus Hostilius the cult was forsaken.  The god manifested his discontent through  the prodigy of a rain of stones: the commission sent by the senate to inquire into it was also greeted by a rain of stones and heard  a loud  voice from the grove on the summit of the mount  requiring the Albans to perform the religious service to the god according to the rites of their country. In consequence of this event the Romans instituted a festival of nine days (''nundinae'').   However a plague ensued:  in the end Tullus Hostilius himself  was affected and lastly killed by the god with a lightningbolt.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 31 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was reestablished on its primitive site by the last Roman king Tarquin the Proud under the leadership of Rome.

The ''[[feriae Latinae]]'', or ''[[Latiar]]'' as they were known originally,&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius  I 16.&lt;/ref&gt; were the common festival  (''panegyris'') of the so-called Priscan Latins&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. prisci Latini p. : "the Latin towns that existed before the foundation of Rome".&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Albans.&lt;ref&gt;L. Schmitz  in W. Smith  ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' London 1875 s. v. Feriae p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt; Their restoration aimed at grounding Roman hegemony in this ancestral religious tradition of the Latins. The original cult was reinstated unchanged as is testified by some archaic features of the ritual:  the exclusion of wine from the sacrifice&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Divinatione''  I 18; Dionysius Hal.  AR  IV  49, 3; Festus p. 212 L l. 30 f.;'' Scholiasta Bobiensis ad Ciceronis pro Plancio'' 23.&lt;/ref&gt; the offers of milk and cheese and the ritual use of rocking  among the games. Rocking is one of the most ancient rites mimicking ascent to heaven and is very widespread. At the ''Latiar'' the rocking took place on a tree and the winner was of course the one who had swung the highest. This rite was said to have been instituted by the Albans to commemorate the disappearance of king [[Latinus]], in battle against [[Mezentius]] the king of [[Caere]]: the rite symbolised a search for him both on earth and in heaven. The rocking as well as the customary drinking of milk was also considered to commemorate and ritually reinstate infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. oscillantes p. 194 M; C. A. Lobeck ''Aglaophamus sive de theologiae mysticae Graecorum causis libri tres'' Königsberg 1829 p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans in the last form of the rite brought the sacrificial ox from Rome and every participant was bestowed a portion of the meat, rite known as ''carnem petere''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Pro Plancio'' 23; Varro LL VI 25; Pliny NH III 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Other games were held in every participant borough. In Rome a race of chariots (''quadrigae'') was held starting  from the Capitol: the winner drank a liquor made with absynth.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny XXVII 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This competition has been compared to the Vedic rite of the [[vajapeya]]: in it seventeen chariots run a phoney race which must be won by the king in order to allow him to drink a cup of ''madhu'', i. e. ''soma''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Alföldi ''Early Rome and the Latins'' Ann Arbor 1965  p. 33 n. 6 cited by O. de Cazanove above p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The feasting lasted for at least four days, possibly six according to [[Niebuhr]], one day for each of the six Latin and Alban ''decuriae''.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa above p. 109; L. Schmitz in ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' London 1875 s. v. Feriae p. 529: Niebuhr  ''History of Rome'' II p. 35 citing Livy V 42, Plutarch  ''Camillus'' 42.&lt;/ref&gt; According to different records 47 or 53 boroughs took part in the festival  (the listed names too differ  in Pliny  NH III 69 and Dionysius of Halicarnassus AR V 61). The ''Latiar'' became an important feature of Roman political life as they were ''[[feriae conceptivae]]'', i. e. their date varied each year: the consuls and the highest magistrates were required to attend shortly after the beginning of the administration. They could not start  campaigning before its end and if any part of the games had been neglected or performed irritually the ''Latiar'' had to be wholly repeated. The inscriptions from the imperial age record the festival back to the time of the [[decemvir]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa p. 110. CIL 2011–2022; XIV 2236–2248.&lt;/ref&gt;
Wissowa remarks the inner linkage of the temple of the Mons Albanus with that of the Capitol apparent in the common association with the rite of the [[Roman triumph|triumph]]:&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa above p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  since 231 BC some triumphing commanders had triumphed  there first with the same legal features as in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Livy XLII 21, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iuppiter Arcanus===
''Arcanus'' was the epithet of one of  the Jupiters worshipped at [[Praeneste]].&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV 2852, 2937, 2972. The other is Imperator Maximus: cfr. Jacqueline Champeux.&lt;/ref&gt; His theology and cult are strictly connected to that of the ''[[Fortuna]] Primigenia'' worshipped in the famous sanctuary there. He is the protector of the lots ''sortes''  stored in the ''arca'', whence his epithet.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Paulus s.v. arcanum p. 16 M.&lt;/ref&gt; G. Dumézil  attempted a purely Indoeuropean interpretation of the theology of Fortuna and of her relationship with Juppiter and Juno,&lt;ref&gt;For an exposition of  Dumézil's interpretation the reader is referred to article [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]].&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars see the subcessive accretion  of a Greek-Etruscan and then a later Greek influence on Fortuna and the theological structure underlying her relationship to Jupiter, i. .e. earlier the child and then the parent of Fortuna.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Gagé]] above p. 39-40;  J. Champeux ''Fortuna. Recherches sur le culte de la Fortune à Rome et dans le monde romain dés  origines à la mort de César. I: Fortune dans la religion archaïque'' Paris 1982 (as reviewed by John Schied, "Religion romaine , religion latine" in ''Revue  d' études latins'' 1985); "Sors Oraculi. Les oracles en Italie sous la République et  l'Empire" in '''MEFRA''' '''102''' 1990 1 p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacqueline Champeaux interprets the boy represented on the ''cista'' of the 3rd century BC from Praeneste, now at the [[Archaeological Museum of Villa Giulia]] in  Rome, as Jupiter ''puer''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Divinatione'' II 85.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''arcanus'': the image engraved on it represents a boy sitting in a cave, reading a lot inscribed on a tablet. This might be a mythic illustration of the working of the oracle, in which Jupiter is at one time the child (''puer'') who ritually draws the rods of the lots (here while deciphering one) and their keeper, ''arcanus''.

The ''sortes'' of Praeneste were inscribed on rods of chestnut wood: they had sprung out of earth fully inscribed when a certain Numerius Suffustius cut the earth open with his spade, under the indication of some dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero above I  34; II 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

A different interpretation of the epithet is directly connected to the word ''arx'', which designates the political, military and religious centre of ancient Italic towns. Thus Iuppiter Arcanus is the god  of the ''arx'' of Praeneste. This interpretation is supported by numerous inscriptions found on the area around the local ''arx'',  sited on the summit of Monte Ginestro (m. 752), which dominates the town. The wall in ''opus  polygonale'' climbed from the town to surround the ''arx'': epigraphs attest the cults of Iuppiter Arcanus&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV  2852, 2937, 2972, 2981.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mars.&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV 2895, 2918.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Marcattili ''Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum Antiquorum. Cult Places'' 
s. v. Arx. Paul Getty foundation 2007 p. 187 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iuppiter Appenninus===
The god was venerated in a sanctuary at the mountain pass between Umbria and Marche now named [[Scheggia Pass]], about eight miles North-East of Iguvium along the [[Via Flaminia]], on Mount Petrara.&lt;ref&gt;''Notiziario degli scavi archeologici'' 1877 p. 120-122; T. Ashby &amp; R. A. L. Fell "The Via Flaminia" in ''Journal of Roman Studies'' XI  1921 p. 125-190 map at p. 178 as cited by J. Champeaux below.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a famous oracle there which gave his ''responsa'' by means of ''sortes'' (lots). Its reputation was great during the Empire and it was consulted by emperor [[Aurelian]]. Dedications have been excavated on the place &lt;ref&gt;CIL XI  5803-4.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Algeria on the top of a hill near Philippeville.&lt;ref&gt;CIL III 12576 and VIII 7691.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Champeaux "Sors oraculi" in ''MEFRA'' '''102''' 1990 p.  276.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudian]] mentions the oracle in his description of the travel of [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] from Fanum Fortunae.&lt;ref&gt;Claudian VI consulatu Honorii Augusti 500-514. As cited by J. Champeaux above.&lt;/ref&gt;

As was the case for the sanctuary of ''Iuppiter Poeninus'' on the Great St. Bernard, the mountain pass held a religious significance as a point of communication between different geographic areas, a passage to a different and unknown world that required a religious protection for the traveller.

===Other Italic Jupiters===
Jupiter was worshipped also under the epithets of ''Imperator Maximus'' in Praeneste, ''Maius'' in [[Tusculum]],&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius  I 12, 17 who connects him to Roman [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]]; CIL XIV 216; ''Ephemeris Epigraphica''  VII 1276.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Praestes''  in [[Tibur]],&lt;ref&gt;CIL 3555; cf. ''Historia Augusta'' Maximinus et Balbinus V 3; in Rome ''Iuppiter Praestitus'' CIL III 4037,  ''Iuppiter praestabilis'' CIL IX 1498 and the ''Lares praestitites''.&lt;/ref&gt; '' Indiges'' at [[Lavinium]]&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 2, 6; Pliny NH III 56; Servius ''Aen.'' I 259.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Anxurus'' at [[Anxur]]&lt;ref&gt;Vergil ''Aeneis'' VII 799 and Servius' comment; Porphirius ''ad Horatii satiras'' I 5, 26; CIL X 6483.&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[Terracina]]), where he was  represented as a young  man without beard.

In Umbro-Oscan areas he was ''Iuve Grabovius'' in the Iguvine Tables, ''Iuppiter Cacunus'' (of the top of mountains, cf. Latin ''cacumen'' and ''Iuppiter Culminalis''), ''Iuppiter Liber'' (see section on ''Liber'' above), ''Diuve Regature'' in the [[Table of Agnone]] that Vetter interprets as ''Rigator'',&lt;ref&gt;Emil Vetter ''Handbuch der Italischen Dialekte'' I Heidelberg 1953 n. 147&lt;/ref&gt; he who irrigates, and Dumézil as ''Rector'', he who rules and ''Diuve Verehasus'' tentatively rendered by Vetter as ''Vergarius''.

(2014). ''Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths?'' [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. pp. 20-21. {{ISBN|978-0-56759-224-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

He was born in [[New York City]] of [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Jew]]ish parentage. He completed his [[law]] studies at the [[City College of New York|College of the City of New York]] and the [[New York University School of Law]] during the 1930s and was admitted in November, 1940. He was registered as a patent attorney in 1956. According to his own statement, he did not practice law as he was attracted to other fields: "[This] legal background has been of great value in evaluating the testimony and credibility of [[New Testament]] documents; especially patent law, which deals largely with questions of dating, priority, originality of material, infringement and copying."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Leidner, ''The Fabrication of the Christ Myth'' (Tampa, FL: Survey Books, 1999), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded [[Hyman Goldin|Hyman E. Goldin]], who in 1948 had published ''The Case of the Nazarene Reopened'', as his principal model. Among other things, Leidner argued for a version of the [[Christ myth theory]], the view that [[Jesus]] never existed.

==''The Fabrication of the Christ Myth''==
Leidner is occasionally remembered for his book, ''The Fabrication of the Christ Myth'', published in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Kenneth Humphreys, ''Jesus Never Existed'' (2nd edn; Uckfield: Iconoclast Press, 2008), p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt; Here he argues that the [[gospel]]s abound with [[anachronism]]s and [[Geography|geographical]] errors, because the gospel writers used the [[Septuagint]] as the basis for their historical fiction. He also notes that while [[Josephus]] describes the [[Galilee|Galileans]] as hardy people, the gospel writers have [[Leprosy|leper]] colonies and sickly people all about. New Testament scholarship, in his view, "creates scenarios and takes over material from the [[social sciences]] to give the impression that Christianity has an authentic historical origin. The pose of objective research is used to prop up the gospel story but no hard evidence can be found to support that story."&lt;ref&gt;Leidner, ''Fabrication'', p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Casey]] has criticized Leidner's book. Casey wrote that Leidner was not a "qualified New Testament scholar" and his historical methodology was "appalling".&lt;ref name="Casey 2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1656">'''Hinduism in Sulawesi''' has been a relatively recent phenomenon, compared to the other islands of [[Indonesia]] where it has been a part of the culture for millennia. [[Agama Hindu Dharma|Indonesian Hinduism]] was brought to the islands in 1963, by [[Balinese people|Balinese]] migrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.north-sulawesi.com/sul_info.html Geography] - North Sulawesi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth==
After [[Hinduism|Hindu Dharma]] was brought to the island, it took hold in many areas, especially after Hinduism became a recognized religion in 1964. In 1977 the [[Toraja]]s of the island converted to [[Hinduism]] ''en masse''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaveda.com/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=49 Great Expectations: Hindu Revival Movements in Java, Indonesia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040820025445/http://www.swaveda.com/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=49 |date=2004-08-20 }} Swaveda - May 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
The [[Toraja]]s have continued many practices of [[animist]] nature, but their conversion to Hinduism has allowed them to keep on their traditions within the framework of an organized religion. Their conversion was hastened by the sudden proliferation of [[Christian]] [[missionaries]] in the area, trying to woo people away from their native beliefs. The practices are more traditionalist in nature, as opposed to [[Hinduism in Bali|Balinese]] Hinduism and [[Hinduism|Indian Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/23/theme/23T6.html Guest Editor] IIAS No. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silesian Domovoy statuette (1).jpg|thumb|Early-20th-century [[Slavs|Slavic]] cult statuette of a [[Domovoy]], the household deity, progenitor of the kin, in [[Slavic paganism]]]]

A '''household deity''' is a [[deity]] or [[spirit]] that protects the [[home]], looking after the entire [[household]] or certain key members. It has been a common belief in [[pagan]] religions as well as in [[folklore]] across many parts of the world.

Household deities fit into two types; firstly, a specific deity - typically a goddess - often referred to as a '''hearth goddess''' or '''domestic goddess''' who is associated with the home and hearth, with examples including the Greek [[Hestia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/Hestia.html HESTIA : Greek goddess of the hearth, home &amp; cooking ; mythology ; pictures : HISTIA, VESTA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Norse [[Frigg]].

The second type of household deities are those that are not one singular deity, but a type, or species of [[animism|animistic]] deity, who usually have lesser powers than major deities. This type was common in the religions of antiquity, such as the [[Lares]] of [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the [[Gashin]] of [[Korean shamanism]], and [[Cofgodas]] of [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]]. These survived Christianisation as [[fairy]]-like creatures existing in folklore, such as the Anglo-Scottish [[brownie (folklore)|Brownie]] and Slavic [[Domovoy]].

Household deities were usually worshipped not in temples but in the home, where they would be represented by small [[idolatry|idols]] (such as the [[teraphim]] of the [[Bible]], often translated as "household gods" in Genesis 31:19 for example), [[amulet]]s, [[painting]]s or reliefs. They could also be found on domestic objects, such as cosmetic articles in the case of [[Tawaret]]. The more prosperous houses might have a small [[shrine]] to the household god(s); the [[lararium]] served this purpose in the case of the Romans. The gods would be treated as members of the family and invited to join in meals, or be given [[sacrifice|offerings of food]] and [[libation|drink]].

== Types==

In many religions, both ancient and modern, a [[god]] would preside over the home.

Certain species, or types, of household deities existed. An example of this was the Roman Lares.

Many European cultures retained house spirits into the modern period.  Some examples of these include:

* [[Brownie (mythology)|Brownie]] (Scotland and England) or [[Hob (folklore)|Hob]] (England) / [[Kobold]] (Germany) / [[Goblin]] / [[Hobgoblin]]
* [[Domovoy]] (Slavic)
* Nisse (Norwegian or Danish) / [[Tomte]] (Swedish) / [[Tonttu]] (Finnish)

Although the cosmic status of household deities was not as lofty as that of the [[Twelve Olympians]] or the [[Aesir]], they were also jealous of their dignity and also had to be appeased with shrines and offerings, however humble.&lt;ref&gt;For example, reserving a seat at the [[hearth]] for the [[Brownie (mythology)|brownie]], and offering him milk and honeycomb.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of their immediacy they had arguably more influence on the day-to-day affairs of men than the remote gods did.  Vestiges of their worship persisted long after Christianity and other major religions extirpated nearly every trace of the major pagan [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]s, and indeed, they continue even today, in one form or another (and in fact may have taken on some of their own, including statues to various saints, such as St. Francis to protect a garden, or gargoyles in older churches).

For centuries Christianity fought a mop-up war against these lingering minor pagan deities, but they proved tenacious.  For example, [[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[Table Talk (Luther)|Tischreden]]'' have numerous quite serious references to dealing with [[kobold]]s.&lt;ref name="DWB"&gt;See Brüder Grimm, ''Wörterbuch", s.v. "kobold", "poltergeist", etc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heine"&gt;''"Luther glaubt nicht mehr an katholische Wunder, aber er glaubt noch an Teufelswesen. Seine Tischreden sind voll kurioser Geschichtchen von Satanskünsten, Kobolden und Hexen."'' ("Erstes Buch".) &lt;br/&gt;"Luther no longer believes in Catholic miracles, but he still believes in diabolical entities.  His ''Table Talks'' are full of curious tales of satanic arts, kobolds, and witches."&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually [[rationalism]] and the [[industrial revolution]] threatened to erase most of these minor deities, until the advent of [[romantic nationalism]] rehabilitated them and embellished them into objects of literary curiosity in the 19th century.  Since the 20th century this literature has been mined for characters for role-playing games, video games, and other fantasy [[persona]]e, not infrequently invested with invented traits and hierarchies somewhat different from their mythological and folkloric roots.

== Origins in animism and ancestor worship ==

=== Shinto as an exemplar of development ===
The general dynamics of the origin and development of household deities over a considerable span may be traced and exemplified by the historically attested origins and current practices of the [[Shinto]] belief system in Japan.  As the British [[Japanology|Japanologist]] [[Lafcadio Hearn]] put it:

{{quote|The real religion of Japan, the religion still professed in one form or other, by the entire nation, is that cult which has been the foundation of all civilized religion, and of all civilized society, – Ancestor-worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/jai/jai04.htm "The Ancient Cult".]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Drawing the picture with broader strokes, he continues:
{{quote|Three stages of ancestor-worship are to be distinguished in the general course of religious and social evolution; and each of these finds illustration in the history of Japanese society. The first stage is that which exists before the establishment of a settled civilization, when there is yet no national ruler, and when the unit of society is the great patriarchal family, with its elders or war-chiefs for lords. Under these conditions, the spirits of the family-ancestors only are worshipped;--each family propitiating its own dead, and recognizing no other form of worship. As the patriarchal families, later on, become grouped into tribal clans, there grows up the custom of tribal sacrifice to the spirits of the clan-rulers;--this cult being superadded to the family-cult, and marking the. second stage of ancestor-worship. Finally, with the union of all the clans or tribes under one supreme head, there is developed the custom of propitiating the spirits of national, rulers. This third form of the cult becomes the obligatory religion of the country; but it does not replace either of the preceding cults: the three continue to exist together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/jai/jai05.htm "The Religion of the Home".]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Furthermore,

{{quote|Whenever a child is born in Japan, a local [[Shinto shrine]] adds the child's name to a list kept at the shrine and declares him or her a "family child" (氏子 ujiko). After death an ujiko becomes a "family spirit", or "family [[kami]]" (氏神 ujigami).}}

Many Japanese houses still have a shrine (''kamidana'', [[kami]] shelf) where offerings are made to ancestral kami, as well as to other kami.

=== Cultural evolution and survival ===
[[Edward Burnett Tylor]], one of the main founders of the discipline of cultural anthropology, spoke of ''survivals'', vestiges of earlier evolutionary stages in a culture's development.  He also coined the term [[animism]].  Tylor disagreed with [[Herbert Spencer]], another founder of anthropology, as well as of sociology, about the innateness of the human tendency towards animistic explanations, but both agreed that ancestor worship was the root of religion and that domestic deities were survivals from such an early stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/5_2/5_2_2.pdf Herbert Spencer as an Anthropologist], ''Journal of Libertarian Studies'', V:2, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animism and totemism ====
In contradistinction to both [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], who defended theories of animistic origins of ancestor worship, [[Émile Durkheim]] saw its origin in [[totem]]ism.  In reality this distinction is somewhat academic, since totemism may be regarded as particularized manifestation of animism, and something of a synthesis of the two positions was attempted by [[Sigmund Freud]].  In Freud's [[Totem and Taboo]], both totem and taboo are outward expressions or manifestations of the same psychological tendency, a concept which is complementary to, or which rather reconciles, the apparent conflict.  Freud preferred to emphasize the psychoanalytic implications of the reification of metaphysical forces, but with particular emphasis on its familial nature.  This emphasis underscores, rather than weakens, the ancestral component.&lt;ref name="SF"&gt;SF.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic deities and ancestor worship ===

==== Jacob Grimm (1835) ====
[[Image:Lararium, Pompeji.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Shrine of the household deities ''[[Lares Familiares|lares]]'' in [[Pompeii]], showing the offering altar and a niche for votive images]]
The doyen of European folklorists [[Jacob Grimm]] did not hesitate to equate the Roman [[Lares Familiares|lar familiaris]] to the [[Brownie (mythology)|brownie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/grimmst/017_12.php JG, Chapter 17, p 12.]&lt;/ref&gt;  He explains in some detail in his [[Deutsche Mythologie]]:
{{quote|
[[Larva (mask)|Larva]] betrays its affinity to [[lares|lar]]..., and the good kindly [[Lares Familiares|lares]] were often held to be [[manes]] or souls of departed ancestors.  So in our German superstition we find instances of souls becoming homesprites or [[kobolds]], and still oftener is there a connexion between unquiet spirits and spectres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/grimmst/031_01.php JG, Chapter 31, p. 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Thomas Keightley (1870) ====

To underscore the equivalence of brownie, kobold and goblin, consider the words of the English historian and folklorist [[Thomas Keightley (historian)|Thomas Keightly]]:

{{quote|
The Kobold is exactly the same being as the Danish Nis, and Scottish Brownie, and English Hobgoblin. [b] He performs the very same services for the family to whom he attaches himself....
The Nis, Kobold, or Goblin, appears in Scotland under the name of Brownie.
&lt;ref name="TK"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm130.htm TK]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== MacMichael (1907) ====
MacMichael elaborated his views on the folkloric belief complex as follows:
{{quote|
What are our elves and fairies, goblins, nisses, brownies, and pixies but latter-day survivals of arkite ancestor worship?  Brownies and pixies were probably invariably of good character, originally, a likelihood suggested by the good points which in many respects survive in their character, their virtues being turned into vices, and, contrariwise, their vices into virtues, as good or ill fortune befell the household and its appurtenances.  Is not the bowl of milk placed for the Brownie in the corner of the room a survival of the drink-offering of wine which was poured out before the household gods of the Romans?&lt;ref name=JHM&gt;JHM&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== New International Encyclopaedia ====
Demonstrating that this evolution and functional equivalence has generally come to be accepted, and that their nature is indeed that proposed by Grimm, one may refer to the early twentieth century ''New International Encyclopaedia'':
{{quote|
The term fairy, however, is also loosely used to include other beings of a similar character like the brownie, elf, fay, gnome, goblin, kobold, pixy, puck, salamander, sprite, sylph, troll and undine....Fairy lore contains likewise certain elements of ancestor-worship, of mythology, and of older religious beliefs....&lt;ref name="NIE1"&gt;NIE, p. 197, s.v. "Fairy".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and also
{{quote|
The resemblance to the Robin Goodfellow (q.v.) of the English and the Kobold of the Germans is conspicuous, and the Roman Lar is also suggested by this suspicion.&lt;ref name="NIE2"&gt;NIE, s.v. "Brownie".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Origin of ancestor worship in animism ===

==== Hearn (1878) ====
[[William Hearn (legal academic)|William Edward Hearn]], a noted classicist and jurist, traced the origin of domestic deities from the earliest stages as an expression of animism, a belief system thought to have existed also in the neolithic, and the forerunner of Indo-European religion.  In his analysis of the Indo-European household, in Chapter II "The House Spirit", Section 1, he states:
{{quote|
The belief which guided the conduct of our forefathers was .... the spirit rule of dead ancestors.&lt;ref name="WEH1"&gt;WEH, Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Section 2 he proceeds to elaborate:
{{quote|
It is thus certain that the worship of deceased ancestors is a ''vera causa'', and not a mere hypothesis....

In the other European nations, the Slavs, the Teutons, and the Kelts, the House Spirit appears with no less distinctness.... [T]he existence of that worship does not admit of doubt....  The House Spirits had a multitude of other names which it is needless here to enumerate, but all of which are more or less expressive of their friendly relations with man....  In [England]...[h]e is the Brownie....In Scotland this same Brownie is well known.  He is usually described as attached to particular families, with whom he has been known to reside for centuries, threshing the corn, cleaning the house, and performing similar household tasks.  His favorite gratification was milk and honey.&lt;ref name="WEH"&gt;WEH&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== George Henderson (1911) ====
George Henderson elaborated on the presumed origin of ancestor worship in [[animism]]:
{{quote|
The second phase of this stage of thought [Animism] would be a cult of human ancestors, specially of tribal chiefs and clan-heroes: this is Manism or Ancestor Worship proper, culminating in hero worship....it is to be noted that the characteristics pertaining to a particular clan or tribal community, which mark ancestor worship, will have fallen very much to the background if they can be at all inferred among the Celts; the relations emphasised will be found pertaining to mythologic concepts and to the Nature-Myth. For, as modifications and transitions in behalf are constant, ancestor worship gets partly transcended. But in Manism the guardian spirit has its specific influence on the tribal consciousness. I recollect [[Aibell|Aoibhell]] of Craig Liath, the guardian spirit of the [[Dál gCais|Dal Caiss]], mentioned in the narrative concerning Brian Boru in the Wars of the Gaedhel and the Gall; there is also Mag Molach or Hairy Hand, and Bodach An Duin of Rothiemurchus, as well as ''the more familiar belief in the Brownie which renders offices of help in some houses,—a feeble survival of early phases of cult.''&lt;ref name="GH"&gt;GH&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Ignatius Timothy Trebitsch-Lincoln circa 1915.jpg|thumb|Ignatius Timothy Trebitsch-Lincoln circa 1915]]
'''Ignatius Timothy Trebitsch-Lincoln''' ({{lang-hu|Trebitsch-Lincoln Ignác}}, {{lang-de|link=no|Ignaz Thimoteus Trebitzsch}}; 4 April 1879 – 6 October 1943), born Abraham Schwarz, AKA Ignaz Thimoteus Trebitzsch, AKA Moses Pinkeles, was a Hungarian adventurer and convicted [[Confidence trick|con artist]]. Of [[Jew]]ish descent, he spent parts of his life as a [[Protestant]] [[missionary]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest, British Member of Parliament for [[Darlington (UK Parliament constituency)|Darlington]], German right-wing politician and spy, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborator]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] abbot in China.

== Early clerical career ==
'''Ignácz Trebitsch''', {{lang-hu|Trebitsch Ignác(z)}} (later changed to ''Trebitsch Lincoln'') was born to an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] family in the town of [[Paks]] (also Orthodox [[shtetl]]) in [[Hungary]] in 1879, subsequently moving with his family to [[Budapest]].  His father, Náthán Trebitsch, ({{lang-hu|Trebitsch Náthán}}) was from [[Moravia]].

After leaving school he enrolled in the ''Royal Hungarian Academy of Dramatic Art'',&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=51599|title=Lincoln, Ignatius Timotheus Trebitsch}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was frequently in trouble with the police over acts of petty theft. In 1897 he fled abroad, ending up in London, where he took up with some Christian missionaries and converted from Judaism. He was [[baptism|baptised]] on Christmas Day 1899, and set off to study at a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] seminary in [[Breklum]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany, destined for the ministry. Restless, he was sent to Canada to carry out missionary work among the Jews of [[Montreal]], first on behalf of the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], and then the [[Church of England|Anglicans]]. He returned to England in 1903 after a quarrel over the size of his stipend.

He became '''Tribich Lincoln''' (or '''I. T. T. Lincoln''') by deed poll in October 1904 and secured [[British naturalisation]], in May 1909.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

== Member of Parliament ==
Trebitsch-Lincoln had the ability to talk himself into virtually any situation, and into any company. He made the acquaintance of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who appointed him as a [[curate]] in [[Appledore, Kent]], his last ecclesiastical post. Soon thereafter he met [[Seebohm Rowntree]], the chocolate millionaire and prominent member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], who offered him the position of his private secretary. With Rowntree's support, he was nominated in 1909 as the prospective Liberal candidate for the Parliamentary constituency of [[Darlington (UK Parliament constituency)|Darlington]] in [[County Durham]], even though he was still a Hungarian citizen at the time. In the [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|election of January 1910]] he beat the sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]], whose family had held the seat for decades. However, despite this dramatic entrance to political life, MPs were not at the time paid and Lincoln's financial troubles grew worse. He was unable to stand when a [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|second general election was called in November 1910]]. Darlington returned to its old allegiance.

== International confidence man ==
In the years leading up to the outbreak of the [[First World War]] he was involved in a variety of failed commercial endeavours, living for a time in [[Bucharest]], hoping to make money in the oil industry. Back in London with no money, he offered his services to the British government as a spy. When he was rejected he went to the [[Netherlands]] and made contact with the [[German Empire|Germans]], who employed him as a double-agent.

Returning to England, he narrowly escaped arrest, leaving for the United States in 1915, where he made contact with the German military attaché, [[Franz von Papen]]. Papen was instructed by [[Berlin]] to have nothing to do with him, whereupon Trebitsch sold his story to the ''[[New York World|New York World Magazine]]'', which published under the banner headline ''Revelation of I. T. T. Lincoln, Former Member of Parliament Who Became a Spy''. His book ''Revelations of an International Spy'' was published by [[Robert M. McBride]] in New York in 1916.

The British government, anxious to avoid any embarrassment, employed the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton agency]] to track down the renegade. He was returned to England &amp;ndash; not on a charge of espionage, which was not covered by the Anglo-American [[extradition treaty]], but of fraud, far more apt in the circumstances. He served three years in [[Parkhurst Prison]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], and was released and deported in 1919.

== Germany and Austria ==
A penniless refugee, Trebitsch-Lincoln worked his way bit by bit into the extreme right-wing and militarist fringe in [[Weimar Germany]], making the acquaintance of [[Wolfgang Kapp]] and [[Erich Ludendorff]] among others. In 1920, following the [[Kapp Putsch]], he was appointed press censor to the new government. In this capacity he met [[Adolf Hitler]], who flew in from [[Munich]] the day before the Putsch collapsed.

With the fall of Kapp, Trebitsch fled south from Munich to [[Vienna]] to Budapest, intriguing all along the way, linking up with a whole variety of fringe political factions, such as a loose alliance of monarchists and reactionaries from all over Europe known as the [[White International]]. Entrusted with the organization's archives, he promptly sold the information to the secret services of various governments. Tried and acquitted on a charge of high treason in [[Austria]], he was deported yet again.

== Conversion to Buddhism ==
He ended up in China, where he took up employment under [[Warlord era|three different warlords]] including [[Wu Peifu]].
Supposedly after a mystic experience in the late 1920s, Trebitsch converted to [[Buddhism]], becoming a [[monk]]. In 1931 he rose to the rank of [[abbot]], establishing his own monastery in [[Shanghai]]. All initiates were required to hand over their possessions to Abbot '''Chao Kung''',(Ch. 照空 [[pinyin]]: Zhào Kōng) as he now called himself, who also spent his time seducing nuns.

In 1937 he transferred his loyalties yet again, this time to the [[Empire of Japan]], producing anti-British propaganda on their behalf. Chinese sources say that he also wrote numerous letters and articles for the European press condemning Japanese imperial aggression in China. After the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], he also made contact with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], offering to broadcast for them and to raise up all the Buddhists of the East against any remaining British influence in the area. The chief of the [[Gestapo]] in the Far East, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] Colonel [[Josef Meisinger]], urged that this scheme receive serious attention. It was even seriously suggested that Trebitsch be allowed to accompany German agents to [[Tibet]] to implement the scheme. He proclaimed himself the new [[Dalai Lama]] after the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, a move that was supported by the Japanese but rejected by the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27931812&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinrich Himmler]] was enthusiastic, as was [[Rudolf Hess]], but it all came to nothing after the latter flew to Scotland in May 1941. After this, [[Adolf Hitler]] put an end to all such pseudo-mystical schemes. Even so, Trebitsch continued his work for the German and Japanese security services in Shanghai until his death in 1943.

== Death ==

In response to a letter protesting [[the Holocaust]] which Trebitsch-Lincoln had written to Hitler, the Nazi High command requested that Japanese forces poison Trebitsch-Lincoln after they invaded Shanghai in 1943. The response to this request is not known; however, Trebitsch-Lincoln did die of stomach trouble in Shanghai in 1943, aged 64.

'''Initiation''' is a concept in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that there are nine levels of spiritual development that beings who live on Earth can progress upward through.  Within these levels, there are four basic levels of spiritual development that human beings on Earth progress through as they [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]], although [[evil]] acts may cause bad [[karma]] which may cause one to temporarily regress.  It is believed that when [[soul]]s have advanced to the fourth level of initiation, they have reached [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and have no further need to reincarnate.  At the fifth level of initiation and beyond, souls  have the opportunity to become members of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]].  This concept was developed by both [[C. W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]] beginning in the 1920s.
  
According to C.W. Leadbeater, ''Initiation'' is a process by which "we try to develop ourselves not that we may become great and wise, but that we may have the power and knowledge to work for humanity to the best effect."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House Page 166&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Alice A. Bailey, ''Initiation'' is the "process of undergoing an [[Higher consciousness|expansion [toward higher levels] of consciousness]]"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 – Lucis Publishing, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed by Theosophists that all [[soul]]s that have reached the fourth level of initiation and evolved beyond the necessity to [[reincarnate]] that do not elect to become [[pratyeka buddha]]s and go directly into [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing Nirvana|Nirvana]] gradually evolve upward through all of these six higher levels of consciousness over thousands or millions of years, and later over billions or trillions of years, other higher levels yet beyond.    

The concept of ''Initiation'' is also recognized in the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of [[religion]]s loosely based on Theosophy.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is referred to as ''[[Ascended Master Teachings#Ascension|Ascension]]''.  

The first six initiations were named by C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey after the six most important events in the life of [[Jesus]].

According to Martin Euser, “Theosophy closes the gap between science and religion by positing reincarnation as a dynamic process [ unlike the concept of the [[eternal return]] ].  The first jewel concerns the doctrine of reincarnation or reimbodiment. It's all a dynamic process and it's the way nature works.”&lt;ref&gt;Euser, Martin ''Science and Spirituality in the New Millennium'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiation zero==
{{Theosophy}}
The vast majority of ordinary humanity lies on the probationary path (below the first initiation).

==First initiation ("birth" to the spiritual life)==
According to Alice A. Bailey, at the first initiation one gains full control of the [[physical body]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 – Lucis Publishing, page 82&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Benjamin Creme]], there are 800,000 people at this level of initiation.&lt;ref name="Creme, Benjamin Page 195"&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission'' Amsterdam:1986 Share International Foundation Page 195&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Ascended Master Teachings, a soul that reaches this level is referred to as having attained their ''[[Ascended Master Teachings#The Individualized "I AM" Presence|Individualized "I AM" Presence]]'', the prerequisite for further spiritual advancement.

==Second initiation ("baptism")==
Alice A. Bailey states that at the second initiation, one gains full control of the [[astral body]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 – Lucis Publishing, page 85&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Benjamin Creme, there are 240,000 people at this level of initiation.&lt;ref name="Creme, Benjamin Page 195"/&gt;

==Third initiation ("the transfiguration")==
An individual who is at the level of the third initiation has acquired fully developed [[clairvoyance]] and [[clairaudience]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 – Lucis Publishing, page 87&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benjamin Creme, there are somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 people at this level of initiation.&lt;ref name="Creme, Benjamin Page 195"/&gt;

==Fourth initiation ("the crucifixion")==
An individual reaching the fourth initiation is known as the perfected one, or an [[Arhat]] ([[Pali]]) or a [[Paramahamsa]] ([[Sanskrit]]).  

At this level, it is believed in Buddhism, one has the ability to remember all of one's [[past lives]], and one also has various minor [[siddhi]]s capable of affecting one's immediate environment.  

Symbolically the fourth initiation is denoted as the ''[[crucifixion]]'' initiation. An Arhat is supposed to be one who does not need to be incarnated again to develop spiritually.  According to Benjamin Creme, there are 450 people at this level of initiation.&lt;ref name="Creme, Benjamin Page 195"/&gt;

==="The seven choices before the perfect [hu]man"===
Having reached the threshold of the fifth initiation, a soul does not necessarily have to enter Earth's spiritual hierarchy proper as one of the "Masters of the Ancient Wisdom".  One has seven paths forward to higher levels that they can choose to go forward on, only one of which is to become a "Master of the Ancient Wisdom".  These seven choices, called in Theosophical literature "the seven choices before the perfect [hu]man" are:

:1.  "Remain with humanity as on official of the Hierarchy", i.e., become one of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]].
:2.  "Remain with humanity as a "[[Nirmanakaya]]", i.e., become a [[bodhisattva]].
:3.  "Join the [[Deva (New Age)|Devas]]".
:4.  "Join the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Staff Corps of the Solar Logos]]", i.e., join the Masters living in etheric cities inside the Sun who supervise the activities of the [[Deva (New Age)|Solar Angels]] that direct the process of evolution of the life waves (process of reincarnation) of the beings on all the planets of the [[solar system]] (all of whom live except those on Earth live on the [[etheric plane]]s of their planets).
:5.  "Prepare the work of the [[Round (Theosophy)|next Chain]]", i.e. join that subsection of the ''Staff Corps of the Solar Logos'' who are the solar planners who plan the future development of planetary civilizations in this solar system.
:6.&amp;7. "Enter [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing Nirvana|Nirvana]]", i.e., become a [[Pratyekabuddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, E.L. ''The Web of the Universe'' London:1936 Theosophical Publishing House "The Seven Choices Before the Perfect Man" Page 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/weboftheuniverse032400mbp/weboftheuniverse032400mbp_djvu.txt "Web of the Universe" text on Internet:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Text available at https://archive.org/stream/weboftheuniverse032400mbp/weboftheuniverse032400mbp_djvu.txt – Does not clarify points 6&amp;7. --&gt;

==Fifth initiation ("the resurrection")==
The fifth initiation, called the ''[[resurrection]]'', comprises the first rung of beings designated in Theosophy as [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] and in the Ascended Master Teachings as [[Ascended master]]s.  

Siddhis at this level include the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] and [[Bilocation|bilocate]] moderate
distances and [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]] within a localized area. 

According to [[C. W. Leadbeater]], [[Alice Bailey]] and Benjamin Creme, there are a total of 43 beings at this level of initiation; this figure is arrived at because all three have stated there are a total of 60 Masters in all—subtracting from the 60 the 17 Masters at level six and above identified by C. W. Leadbeater, leaves a total of 43 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom at the fifth level of initiation. 

Of these 43 Masters, a total of 12 have been identified by name, one by C. W. Leadbeater, nine by Alice Bailey, and two by Benjamin Creme.  

C. W. Leadbeater named a Master called '''Master Jupiter''' who lives in [[India]] that is involved with overseeing the people, government, and development of India that is at this level.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C. W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alice A. Bailey identified as Masters the '''Master P.''', who is said to help ''St. Germain'' bring about the [[Age of Aquarius]] in the Americas, and two different ''English Masters'' ('''English Master #1''' and '''English Master #2'''), one of which is said to have inspired the [[labor movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957&amp;mdash;Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) Master P. Page 682; See numerous references to "English Master" in Index&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these three, she identified the three ''Lords of Liberation'' – ('''Lord of Liberation #1''', '''Lord of Liberation #2''', and '''Lord of Liberation #3''').  According to Alice A. Bailey, the three ''Lords of Liberation'' formulated the slogan ''[[Liberty, equality, brotherhood|Liberty, Equality, Fraternity]]''.  Finally, Alice A. Bailey also identified the three ''Lords of Karma'' ('''Lord of Karma #1''', '''Lord of Karma #2''', and '''Lord of Karma #3''').  These three beings are said to live in [[Shamballah]] and help ''Sanat Kumara'' decide where and when [[soul]]s are going to [[Reincarnation|incarnate]] in their next life.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957&amp;mdash;Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) "Lords of Liberation"&lt;/ref&gt; 

Benjamin Creme identified two previously unidentified Masters at this level in 2001—he stated that there is a '''Master in Moscow'''&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach: New Light and Life for Humanity'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 179&lt;/ref&gt; and a '''Master in Tokyo''',&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach: New Light and Life for Humanity'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 177&lt;/ref&gt; but did not give their personal names.    

Forty-three minus 12 equals 31 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom at this level that are still unidentified by name.

[[Guy Ballard]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] have identified, named, and received dictations from at least 200 new "[[Ascended Master]]s" at this level;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press "Profiles of the Ascended Masters" – pages 13–394 More than 200 "Ascended Masters" are listed&lt;/ref&gt; however, these Masters are not recognized as Masters of the Ancient Wisdom by traditional Theosophists.  Ascended Masters named by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet at this level include such Masters as '''[[Confucius]]''', '''[[Lord Ling]]''', '''[[Master Jesus#Twin flame|Lady Master Magda]]''', '''[[Athena|Pallas Athena]]''', '''[[Master Lanello|Lanello]]''',  '''[[Kwan Yin]]''', the '''Great Divine Director''', '''[[Padre Pio]]''',  '''[[Master Godfre|Godfre]]''' and his "twin flame" (celestial wife) '''[[Lady Master Lotus]]''', and many dozens more.

In the Ascended Master Teachings, the ''Master Jupiter'' is referred to as '''Chananda'''.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Chananda Pages 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, ''Sanat Kumara'' has a grandson named '''[[Sanat Kumara#Master Cha Ara|Master Cha Ara]]''' who is half mortal and who just recently became a Master, therefore meaning he is functioning at the fifth level.

==Sixth initiation ("the ascension" or "masterhood")==
The Chohans (Lords) of the [[Seven Rays]] – '''[[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]''' (1st Ray), Master '''[[Koot Hoomi]]''' (2nd Ray), '''[[Paul the Venetian]]''' (3rd Ray), '''[[Serapis Bey]]''' (4th Ray), '''[[Master Hilarion]]''' (5th Ray), '''[[Master Jesus]]''' (6th Ray), and the '''[[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Master Rakoczi]]''' (7th Ray) – are seven of the beings at the level of the sixth initiation, while their coordinator and [[communications director]] '''[[Djwal Khul]]''' is another, making a total of eight at this level.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 "Diagram 5 – The Spiritual Hierarchy" – facing page 248&lt;/ref&gt; 

All of these Masters are recognized by both traditional Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, ''Master Rakoczi'' is referred to as  '''[[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]]'''.

Siddhis at this level include the ability to teleport, bilocate, or levitate to anyplace on Earth. 

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, on January 1, 1956, the Master Jesus advanced from the sixth to the seventh level of initiation and the '''[[Lady Master Nada]]''' (a ''lady'' Master recognized in the Ascended Master Teachings but not in Theosophy) advanced from the fifth level to the sixth level and replaced the Master Jesus as the chohan of the sixth ray.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seventh initiation ("bodhisattva" , "avatar", or "christhood")==
The seventh initiation is known as the initiation of the [[Bodhisattava]] (Buddhism) or the [[Avatar]] (Hinduism). The '''[[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]]''' or ''World Teacher'' (known as [[Krishna]] by [[Hindus]], the [[Christ]] by [[Christian]]s, [[Maitreya]] by [[Buddhist]]s, [[Messiah]] by the [[Jew]]s, the Iman [[Mahdi]] by [[Muslims]], and the [[Peshotan]] by the [[Zoroastrian]]s) is at this level.  At this level also are said to be the '''[[Manu (Theosophy)|Chakshusha Manu]]''', the '''[[Manu (Theosophy)|Vaivasvatu Manu]]''' and the '''[[Maha Chohan]]''',&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922, Lucis Publishing Chart, page 49&lt;/ref&gt; thus making a total of four beings at this level.

In  the Ascended Master Teachings, the ''Chakshusha Manu'' is referred to as '''[[Manu (Theosophy)#Ascended master teachings|Lord Himalaya]]'''.

According to Benjamin Creme, a being at this level has the ability to teleport to anyplace in the [[solar system]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam: 1997 Share International Foundation, page 72&lt;/ref&gt; Creme admits, however, that unless one is in a hurry, it's simpler, easier, and uses less energy to just take a [[flying saucer]].  Creme has also stated that beings at this level have a level of [[invulnerability]] such that they would not be affected by a [[bullet]] fired at them, nor even by the detonation of a [[nuclear bomb]].  

In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that on January 1, 1956, Maitreya advanced from the 7th level to the 8th level.  
==Eighth initiation ("buddhahood")==

Level eight is the level of the '''[[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'''.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"/&gt;

At this level also, according to C.W. Leadbeater, are '''[[Pratyeka-Buddha|The Three Pratyeka Buddha]]s''' (the task of these three [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] is to focus the Seven Rays from ''Sanat Kumara'' through ''Djwal Khul'' to the chohans of the Seven Rays).&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"/&gt; Unlike Buddha, the three Pratyeka Buddhas do not interact with the human race except for fulfilling their function of focusing the seven rays.

Alice A. Bailey stated that communication among beings at this level is entirely by [[telepathy]].  According to Theosophist [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], beings at this level can freely roam both in [[interplanetary space]] and in nearby [[interstellar space]] in full consciousness while physically remaining in their celestialized bodies and carrying on normal activities such as communicating with other beings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett, A. P.]] ''Esoteric Buddhism'', London 1883&lt;/ref&gt;   In order for beings at this level to be able to do this, it would have been  necessary for them to have activated their transpersonal chakras.  Benjamin Creme and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have stated that beings at this level can teleport as far as the star [[Sirius]].  

This makes four beings at this level, according to traditional Theosophy.

In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that on January 1, 1956, Buddha advanced from the 8th level to the 9th level, becoming co-equal with ''Sanat Kumara''.

The three Pratyeka Buddhas have not been mentioned so far in any of the Ascended Master Teachings. Elizabeth Clare Prophet described and quoted from Buddhist sources on the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas]] of mainstream [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana Buddhism]]. They focus the five inner rays which together with the seven more external rays focused by the Chohans comprise the [[Ascended Master Teachings#The rays o ascension|twelve rays]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] ''Vol. 37 No. 2 The Buddhas in Winter 2 Introduction to the Five Dhyani Buddhas and Their Mandala, p2'', January 9, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tsl.org/tag/dhyani-buddhas/ "The five Dhyani Buddhas" on TSL.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ninth initiation ("godhood")==
Level nine is the "Lord of the World": '''[[Sanat Kumara]]''' –  "The Eternal Youth" and "The Ancient of Days", the [[Nordic alien]] that is believed by Theosophists to be the "Lord of the World", i.e., the governing [[deity]] of Earth.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"/&gt;

C.W. Leadbeater discussed the abilities of beings at this level.  He stated that Sanat Kumara's "consciousness is of so extended a nature that it comprehends at once all the life on our globe.  In his hands are the powers of cyclic destruction, for he wields ''Fohat'' [i.e. beams composed of "[[Micro black hole|bubbles in space]]" used by Theosophical deities to materialize or dematerialize material objects&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 19&lt;/ref&gt;] in its higher forms and can deal directly with cosmic forces outside our chain [i.e., outside our solar system]."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Page 296&lt;/ref&gt; Thus according to Leadbeater powers of beings at this level include [[omniscience]] regarding the events occurring on a single inhabited planet, [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialization]] of large objects, and the ability to affect at a distance to some degree happenings in other nearby [[planetary system]]s.  

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara has a "twin flame" (celestial wife) named '''[[Sanat Kumara#Lady Master Venus|Lady Master Venus]]''' who he brought with him from Venus, as well as a daughter named '''[[Sanat Kumara#Lady Master Meta|Lady Master Meta]]''' born to them on Venus who they brought with them to Earth, both of them presumably also functioning at the ninth level of initiation.

==Tenth initiation ("planetary logos")==
The tenth initiation is considered to symbolize perfection and is used to describe the '''Planetary Logos''', also called the '''Spirit of the Earth''', and specifically denoted as the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic being functioning within Earth|Planetary Logos of Earth]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House Chapter XXVI – "The Building of the Earth" ''The Planetary Logos'', pages 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reach the status of a ''Planetary Logos'', this being would have had to have been a high level ''[[Deva (New Age)|Planetary Deva]]'' in some other solar system before it incarnated inside our planet at the time of the [[Creation myth|creation of the world]]. According to C. W. Leadbeater, the "Planetary Logos" is functioning at the tenth level of initiation and [[Sanat Kumara]], in continuous telepathic rapport with the Planetary Logos, functions as its spokes-deity.  Since the formulation in the early 1970s by [[James Lovelock]] of the [[Gaia theory|Gaia hypothesis]], many Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings, adopting the [[Gaia philosophy]], nowadays simply refer to the "Planetary Logos of Earth" as '''[[New Age Gaian|Gaia]]''', the New Age version of what in many religions is called the [[Mother goddess#Earth Mother|Earth mother]]..

==Levels of initiation beyond the tenth level==
In the theosophical teachings of Alice Bailey, there is a powerful being living inside the sun serving the Solar Logos called the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Avatar of Synthesis]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957 Lucis Publishing Co. See "Avatar of Synthesis" in the Index&lt;/ref&gt; Its job is to transmit the [[Seven rays#Theosophy|seven rays]] from the heart of the sun through the ''seven spirits before the [solar] throne'' to all the life waves of the solar system.  According to Benjamin Creme, the ''Avatar of Synthesis'' is functioning at the ''17th level of initiation''.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share Foundation Page 72&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ascended Master Teachings, this being is called '''Ray-O-Light'''.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Ray-O-Light Page 301&lt;/ref&gt; The only master above all these levels is the Christ.

The '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]]''' itself must be at least several levels beyond the 17th level.  The ''Solar Logos'', the [[Sun God]] in Theosophy, is personified as the cosmic beings '''[[Helios]]''' and his ''twin flame'' (celestial wife) '''[[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]''', the "God and  Goddess of this [[solar system]]", in the Ascended Master Teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Helios and Vesta Page 126&lt;/ref&gt;  

Perhaps several dozen or a couple of hundred of levels above the ''Solar Logos'' would be the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Milky Way Galaxy from the galactic core|Galactic Logos]]'''.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, the ''Galactic Logos'' is personified as the cosmic being '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Milky Way Galaxy from the galactic core|Averran]]'''.

C.W. Leadbeater stated, "The ladder of being [i.e., of initiation] extends upward into clouds of light, into which few of us can yet penetrate, and when we ask those who stand higher than we and know infinitely more than we do, all they can say is that it extends beyond their sight also.  They know very many more steps of it than we do, but it goes still further, onwards and upward to unimaginable heights of glory, and no one knows its end."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Page 207&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of levels of initiation ultimately would depend on the physical size of the [[Cosmos]], because enough souls would have to climb the ladder to ensoul all the [[star]]s with ''stellar logoi'' and all the [[galaxy|galaxies]] with ''galactic logoi'', plus provide staffing for their attendant cosmic bureaucracies of angels, archangels, etc., as souls beyond them on the scale of initiation move up the ladder.  If [[Alan Guth]]'s [[inflation theory]], which states that the actual size of the Cosmos is at least fifteen [[orders of magnitude]] larger than the [[observable universe]] (itself 93,000,000,000 [[light year]]s in diameter), is correct, then there could be several hundred or even thousands of levels of initiation necessary to staff the [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structures of the cosmos]] before reaching the level of the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Cosmos from the Great Central Sun|Cosmic Logos]]'''. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the ''Cosmic Logos'' is personified as the cosmic beings '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Cosmos from the Great Central Sun|Alpha and Omega]]'''. 

If the concept of the [[Multiverse]] is true, then other hierarchies exist in [[Multiverse (religion)|other Universes]].  It is believed in Theosopy that the concept of the Multiverse is true because Theosophists have stated that the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#God|Universal Logos]]''' has created many other cosmoses besides our own.

==Initiation in popular culture==
'''[[Music]]'''
* In 1975, [[Todd Rundgren]] released an album titled ''[[Initiation (Todd Rundgren album)|Initiation]]'' which has a song called "Initiation" on side one.  The title of the album is apparently based on the Theosophical concept of Initiation as taught by Alice Bailey and [[C. W. Leadbeater]].  The entire second side of the album is taken up by a song called "A Treatise on Cosmic Fire"; the three parts of the song are listed as: "I. The Internal Fire, or Fire by Friction; II. The Fire of Spirit, or Electric Fire; The Fire of Mind, or Solar Fire." The second parts of these three phrases are taken directly from Alice A. Bailey's book ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9016">'''Ishoʿyahb II''' of Gdala was patriarch of the Church of the East from 628 to 645.  He reigned during a period of great upheaval in the Sassanian empire.  He became patriarch at the end of a disastrous war between Rome and Persia, which weakened both powers. Two years later the Moslem Arabs began a career of conquest in which they overthrew the Sassanian empire and occupied the eastern provinces of the Roman empire.  Ishoʿyahb lived through this momentous period, and is said to have met both the Roman emperor [[Heraclius]] and the second Moslem caliph [[Umar|ʿUmar ibn al-Khattab]].

The Syriac name Ishoʿyahb means 'Jesus has given', and is spelled variously in English.  Alternative spellings include Yeshuyab and Ishu-yahb.  Ishoʿyahb II is commonly known as Ishoʿyahb of Gdala, to distinguish him from two near-contemporary Nestorian patriarchs, [[Ishoyahb I|Ishoʿyahb I of Arzun]] (582–95) and [[Ishoyahb III|Ishoʿyahb III of Adiabene]] (649–59).

== Sources ==
Ishoʿyahb's patriarchate, the Arab conquest of Iraq and Ishoʿyahb's dealings with the Moslem leaders are described in considerable detail in the ''[[Chronicle of Seert]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of Seert'' (ed. [[Addai Scher|Scher]]), ii. 234–305&lt;/ref&gt;  Briefer accounts are given in the ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'' of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (thirteenth-century), and the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), ʿAmr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century).

==Life==
Ishoʿyahb was a native of the village of Gdala in the district of Beth ʿArbaye between Nisibis and Mosul.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of Seert'' (ed. Scher), ii. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishoʿyahb studied at the [[School of Nisibis]] when it was under the presidency of the controversial theologian Hnana, who searched for common theological ground between the [[Nestorianism]] of the Church of the East and the Chalcedonian doctrines held in the Roman empire. He was one of the 300 students who left the college when Hnana was expelled. After a long vacancy in the patriarchate, he was elected patriarch of the Church of the East in 628.

In 630 Ishoʿyahb led a delegation of Persian clerics to Aleppo to discuss with the Roman emperor Heraclius the possibility of a reconciliation between the Roman and Persian Churches.  Although little is known of the content of Ishoʿyahb’s discussions with Heraclius, he evidently persuaded the emperor that, despite its traditional reverence for the teachings of Theodore of Mopsuestia, the doctrinal position of the Church of the East was orthodox.  He was asked for his views on [[monotheletism]], the doctrine of the single will recently espoused by the patriarchate of Constantinople, and responded with a confession of faith which was accepted by the Roman bishops.  Two masses were then celebrated, one conducted by Ishoʿyahb according to the rite used by the Church of the East, in which both Heraclius and his bishops received the eucharist from his hands, and one according to the Chalcedonian rite.  In his mass Ishoʿyahb omitted the customary references to the 'three doctors' Diodorus, Theodore and Nestorius, hoping that the Romans would avoid any mention of Cyril of Alexandria in theirs; but his conciliatory gesture was not reciprocated by the Romans.  On his return to Persia Ishoʿyahb was accused by the bishop Bar Sawma of Susa of making damaging concessions to the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmshurst, ''The Martyred Church'', 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishoʿyahb II was patriarch during the Arab conquest of Iraq, and according to later Nestorian tradition approached the Moslem leaders to win guarantees for the treatment of Christians in the Sassanian empire.  The ''Chronicle of Seert'', probably written in the ninth century, records two approaches to the Moslems, one by Ishoʿyahb's emissaries to Muhammad's successor [[Abu Bakr]] (632–4), and a second by Ishoʿyahb himself to the caliph [[Umar|ʿUmar ibn al-Khattab]] (634–44).  ʿUmar is said to have granted the Church of the East a charter of protection.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of Seert'' (ed. Scher), ii. 298–304&lt;/ref&gt;  The authenticity of these supposed approaches is very doubtful, and modern authorities are inclined to reject them.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, ''Empire and Elites'', 1–32; Wilmshurst, ''The Martyred Church'', 102–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Seleucia-Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sasanian empire and the seat of the Nestorian patriarchs at this period, fell to Saʿd b. Abi Waqqas in the spring of 637.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamicstudies.info/history/islamic_openings/islamic_openings.php?id=4&lt;/ref&gt;  Saʿd carried off its gates, symbolising the rulership of central Iraq, to Kufa, and for the rest of his reign Ishoʿyahb resided at Karka d'Beth Slokh (modern Kirkuk) in Beth Garmai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Seeing Islam as Others Saw It | author=Robert G Hoyland | year=1998 | publisher=Darwin Press | pages=182–9 [186] | chapter=A Chronicler of Khuzistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 645 Ishoʿyahb journeyed to Nisibis to settle a dispute between the city's Nestorian Christians and their [[Nisibis (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|metropolitan]] Quriaqos. He died at Karkh Guddan and was buried there.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of Seert'' (ed. Scher), ii. 304–5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literary achievement ===
Ishoʿyahb II is included in the list of Syriac authors compiled by the fourteenth-century Nestorian writer ʿAbdishoʿ of Nisibis.  According to ʿAbdishoʿ, his principal writings were a commentary on the Psalms and a number of letters, histories, and homilies.  A hymn of his has survived in a Nestorian psalter (MS BM Add. 14675).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Wright | title=A Short History of Syriac Literature | pages=169–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nestorian mission to China, 635 ===
The first recorded Christian mission to China arrived in the Chinese capital Chang'an in 635, during Ishoʿyahb's reign.  The mission, whose history was recorded on the famous [[Nestorian Stele]], erected in Chang'an in 781, was led by a Nestorian monk with the Chinese name A-lo-pen.  It is possible, but by no means certain, that Ishoʿyahb was behind this initiative.

* [[Hu Jintao]] (1942–): Chinese politician who was the [[paramount leader]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] from 2002 to 2012. He held the offices of [[General Secretary]] of the Communist Party from 2002 to 2012, [[President of the People's Republic of China]] from 2003 to 2012 and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] from 2004 to 2012.

* [[Jiang Zemin]] (1926–): Chinese communist politician, [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] 1989–2002 and [[President of the People's Republic of China]] 1993–2003. In June 1999, Jiang established an extralegal department, the 6-10 Office, to expel Falun Gong from mainland China. On 20 July, security forces abducted and detained thousands of Falun Gong organizers they identified as leaders.

He was convinced that people used religion only as a mask to deceive the innocent people. Periyar proclaimed himself as a vowed atheist.

At one stage, he asserted that the meaningless religious treatises must be burnt. He believed that belief in God dampens the natural human qualities such as initiatives, perseverance and enthusiasm. Fear of God is the beginning of one's own foolishness. Periyar attacked mainly Hinduism and its gods, because they are the greatest enemy of human equality and liberty. He felt that if a person should live with self-respect he must do away with religion."

&lt;/ref&gt; is a festive [[procession#Religious processions|religious procession]], followed by [[intercession]]s, which augments [[Vespers#Great Vespers|great vespers]] (or, a few times a year, [[Compline#Great Compline|great compline]]) in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Catholic]] churches on important [[feast day]]s (and, at least according to the written rubrics, any time there is an [[all-night vigil]].&lt;ref name=Typikon&gt;{{Citation|year=1907 |title=Тvпико́нъ сіесть уста́въ (Title here transliterated into Russian; actually in Church Slavonic) (The Typicon which is the Order) |publisher=Сvнодальная тvпографiя (The Synodal Printing House) |publication-place=Москва (Moscow, Russian Empire) |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Following a lity is another liturgical action, an artoklasia, and either of these terms may be used to describe both liturgical actions collectively.

==Procession==
At vespers, after the ''Prayer at the Bowing of Heads'', the procession commences: the clergy, including a [[deacon]] with a censer and, when logistically possible, the [[chanter]]s, process to the [[narthex]] of the church during which are sung [[sticheron|stichera]] of the feast and/or of the patron of the church.  Once the procession reaches the narthex and the stichera have been sung, the deacon begins a series of lengthy petitions (these are the "lity" proper), asking for the [[intercessory prayer|intercession]] of many saints, and praying for the church and the world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...For the salvation of the people; for the [governmental authorities]; for the clergy; for all afflicted Christian souls desirous of aid; for this city, the country and all Christians living therein; for our deceased fathers and brethren; for deliverance from famine, epidemics, earthquake, flood, fire, the sword, the invasion of barbarians and civil strife....".&lt;ref name="Sokolof"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Lord, have mercy" is sung multiple times after each petition, and this is followed by the priest reciting a prayer summarizing the petitions.

After this, the priests and deacons proceed to the artoklasia table which will have been placed in the center of the nave, all others return to their usual places, and vespers continues as usual with the [[Aposticha]] (even if the Lity is celebrated in conjunction with compline, the services ends as vespers).

===Outside the church building===
[[Image:Litany1.JPG|thumb|left|Lity procession on the [[Feast day|Feast]] of [[Saint Nicholas]] in [[Piraeus]], [[Greece]].]]
Occasionally the lity is held outdoors. In places it is the custom to process around the church, the first and fifth intercessions being sung in front of the entrance and the other three intercessions being sung at each of the other three sides. For special festivity or on other occasions, ''e.g.'', or in times of public calamity, the lity may be held in fields (in case of famine) or in public squares or city halls,&lt;ref name="Sokolof"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; in which instance the procession that otherwise would be to the narthex of the church continues to wherever the lity is held.

==Artoklasia==
[[File:2013-08-14--Artoklasia during Feast of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary.JPG|thumb|Artoklasia service, with bottles of wine and olive oil. The five loaves are reminiscent of the five loaves that Jesus Christ blessed in the desert, which in turn signified the five books of Moses (''[[Torah#Pentateuch|Pentateuch]]'').]]
[[Image:Artoclassia.1.JPG|thumb|Artoklasia table with loaves of bread and bottles of wine and olive oil]]

After the lity the priests and deacons go to the middle of the church to a table prepared beforehand with five loaves of leavened bread, the [[Artos#Artoklasia|artoklasia loaves]], bottles of wine and olive oil and, in the Russian tradition, also a dish containing wheat kernels.

While the [[Apolytikion|apolytikia (dismissal hymns)]] are sung &amp;mdash; and the rubrics always mandate exactly three such hymns when there is a lity &amp;mdash; the deacon circles the artoklasia table, censing the offerings thereon, during each, three times in all. Thereafter the priest uncovers his head and takes up one of the five loaves in his right hand, while he says the prayer:
[[Image:Litie2.jpg|left|thumb|Artoklasia table in the Russian tradition. The five loaves in the front are covered with an embroidered cloth. At the back center is a dish of wheat, and at the sides are a vessel of olive oil and a cruet of wine.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;O Lord Jesus Christ our God, Who didst bless the five loaves and didst therewith feed the five thousand: Do Thou, the same Lord, bless these loaves, wheat, wine and oil; and multiply them in this holy habitation, and in all the world; and sanctify all the faithful who shall partake of them. For it is Thou, O Christ our God, Who dost bless and sanctify all things; and unto Thee we ascribe glory: with the Father Who hath no beginning, and Thine all-holy, good, and life-creating Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the words "loaves, wheat, wine and oil" above, he points with the loaf he holds in his right hand to each item as he names it, making thereby the [[sign of the cross]]. Then he breaks the loaf he holds in his hand.

The vespers resumes as usual with "Blessed be the name of the Lord" but followed by Psalm 33(34), "I will bless the Lord at all times...". 

The [[typicon]] directs that subsequently the reading of the life of the saint whose feast it is to be read or, on a Sunday, a selection from the New Testament.&lt;ref group=note&gt;"From the Sunday of Pascha to the Sunday of All Saints, the Acts of the Apostles is read. On the remaining Sundays of the year are read seven Catholic Epistles of the Apostles, and the fourteen Epistles of the Holy Apostle Paul, and the Apocalypse of Saint John the Theologian."&lt;/ref&gt; During this time all sit and the a piece of the blessed bread and a cup of the blessed wine are given to each to provide nourishment to sustain him through the rest of the vigil&lt;ref name="Sokolof"/&gt; with the caveat that they are to be consumed straightway so as to keep the fast before Communion.&lt;ref name="Typikon"/&gt; While this custom is still observed in some monasteries, notably on [[Mount Athos]],&lt;ref name="Hapgood"/&gt; usually nowadays the blessed bread is simply distributed to the faithful when they exit the service; however, in the Russian tradition, at [[matins]] following the singing of Psalm 50(51), all come forward to venerate the [[Gospel Book]] (if it is Sunday) or the [[icon]] of the feast, and each person is anointed and given a piece of the blessed bread dipped in the wine.

By sundry local customs, the wheat may be ground into flour, often for making [[prosphora]], or may be reserved until the time of sowing.

===Paschal Vigil===
A modified artoklasia without any lity follows vespers on [[Holy Saturday]].  Since the rubrics for fasting proscribe oil that day, only bread and wine are blessed, and these are distributed to each together with "six dates or figs";&lt;ref name=Typikon/&gt; nowadays, however, the dates and figs are generally only distributed in monasteries where they are typically consumed with other minimalistic sustenance in the [[refectory]].

===Alternate Byzantine Catholic usage===
In some Catholic sources, artoklasia was wrongly identified with the Latin practice of "Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament," in which the consecrated Eucharist is exposed for the worship of the faithful.  The service of artoklasia might have fallen into disuse for at time among Byzantine Catholics but never was it confused with "Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01756b.htm
|title=Artoklasia
|accessdate=2012-12-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least in these days, lity with artoklasia is regularly celebrated among Byzantine Catholics for feasts, albeit with various degrees of fidelity to the rubrics.

==History and Origins==
The lity takes place in the narthex so that the [[catechumen]]s and [[penitent]]s, who in ancient times were not allowed to enter the [[nave]] could participate in the joy and blessings of the feast and the faithful would follow the clergy into the narthex to show their humility and brotherly love towards the catechumens and penitents.&lt;ref name="Sokolof"/&gt;

Two possible explanations have been suggested for the origins of this procession.  The fourth century pilgrim [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] states that after [[Vespers]] at the Tomb of Christ a procession would go to the site of Calvary where further prayers were said after which the congregation were dismissed.  At the monastery of [[Mar Sabbas]] in the Judaean wilderness at the end of Vespers the monks would go to the tomb of St. Sabbas where the lity prayers would be said.  In fact, the latter tradition may have been a monastic adaptation of the Jerusalem practice and since the liturgical traditions of the monastic community of Mar Sabbas became of central importance in the development of the Byzantine liturgical traditions, especially after the thirteenth century, the lity would have spread to the rest of the Byzantine world from there.  One should also note that the processions at the end of Vespers are also found in the [[Ambrosian Rite]] and formerly during  the Easter Octure in the [[Norbertine Rite]].

==The Religion and Diversity Project==
Beaman is the principal investigator of the Religion and Diversity Project, a $2.5 million, seven-year, [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] (SSHRC) Major Collaborative Research Initiative (MCRI) headquartered at the University of Ottawa. She guides a team of 37 international researchers who study religious diversity in Canada as well as Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. The project explores the contours of religious diversity and how to best respond to opportunities and challenges presented by religious diversity in ways that promote a just and peaceful society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faith in All Fairness|url=http://research.uottawa.ca/perspectives/faith-all-fairness|website=Research Perspectives University of Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers look at the social construction of religious identities, how religion is defined and delimited in law and public policy, and how gender and sexuality emerge as volatile issues in debates over religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining Religious Freedom|url=http://www.innovation.ca/en/ResearchInAction/ImpactStory/Definingreligiousfreedom|website=Innovation Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davidson|first1=Krista|title=Research examines Muslims' experiences in Canada|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/Living/2015-07-29/article-4228484/Research-examines-Muslims%26rsquo%3B-experiences-in-Canada/1|publisher=The Telegram|date=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perspectives from multiple academic disciplines inform the work of the project, including anthropology, communication, education, history, law, philosophy, political science, religious studies, and sociology.[http://religionanddiversity.ca/en/project-team/#project] Advocating a shift away from the language and frameworks of tolerance and accommodation, Beaman and her team of researchers focus on the creation of innovative approaches to religious diversity in order to foster substantive or deep equality.

==Religion and Law==
Beaman has written extensively on religious diversity and the intersections of religion and law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casey|first1=Catherine L.|title=Review: Varieties of Religious Establishment|journal=Politics, Religion &amp; Ideology|date=2014|volume=15|issue=3|pages=473–474|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21567689.2014.948601?journalCode=ftmp21|doi=10.1080/21567689.2014.948601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=Jonnette Watson|title=Review: Reasonable Accommodation: Managing Religious Diversity ed. by Lori G Beaman|journal=Canadian Journal of Women and the Law|date=2013|volume=25|issue=2|pages=411–418|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/canadian_journal_of_women_and_the_law/v025/25.2.hamilton.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bramadat|first1=Paul|title=Review: Religion and Diversity in Canada edited by Lori G.

The ensuing legal fray exposed what Beaman characterized as a "culture of fear" and the construction of the religious 'other' as a threat to social order (7). The work offers a critical socio-legal analysis, drawing on [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] notions of genealogies of power, sedimentation, and resistance to explain how religious minorities (in particular post 9/11 Muslims) or those on the margins of normative religion are perceived as destabilizing forces that "threaten a Christian hegemony that is itself in flux and under revision" (5). Beaman points to "law’s privileged status" as a "producer of truth" and engages the work of [[Carol Smart]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smart|first1=Carol|title=Feminism and the Power of Law|date=1989|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; who proposes the decentering of law in order to create more comprehensive depictions of social life (7-8). Beaman's publication record demonstrates a preoccupation with how the courts define religion and how the normalization or marginalization of certain religious groups influences the interpretation of religious freedom. She has also written about polygamy and how law frames certain types of family structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Talbot|first1=Christine|title=Review: Polygamy's rights and wrongs: Perspectives on harm, family and law|journal=Nova Religio|date=2013|volume=18|issue=3|pages=132–134|doi=10.1525/nr.2015.18.3.132|url=http://nr.ucpress.edu/content/18/3/132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her commentaries on government responses to religion in the public sphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Balancing Religion and State in North America|url=http://interfaithradio.org/Story_Details/Balancing_Religion_and_State_in_North_America|website=Interfaith Voices on Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as the proposed [[Charter of Québec Values]]) [http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2014/02/20/the-charter-of-quebec-values/#Beaman] and the complexities of religious freedom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Science minister's coyness on evolution worries researchers|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/science-minister-s-coyness-on-evolution-worries-researchers-1.800906|agency=CBC News Technology &amp; Science|date=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; have appeared on the academic blog [[The Immanent Frame]] [http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2012/04/27/beyond-establishment/] and in the [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation|Tony Blair Faith Foundation’s]] Global Perspectives Series, where she emphasized the need for positive narratives and more nuanced understandings of intra-religious diversity. [http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/foundation/news/negative-positive-narratives-values-and-strategies-negotiating-difference] Her work on diversity also considers non-belief and non-religious world views, including the growing social significance of those who identify as religious 'nones'.  The status and voices of nones are a concern for Beaman, as they fall outside the purview of religious freedom protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomlins|first1=Steven|title=Reflections on atheist identities: Spaces and social contexts|url=http://nsrn.net/reflections-on-atheist-identities-spaces-and-social-contexts/|website=NSRN Online: Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaman’s career corpus demonstrates a commitment to the broad themes of justice, fairness, equality and inclusion.

==Deep Equality==
In 2015, the Royal Society of Canada acknowledged Beaman's contributions to the study of religious diversity in Canada and her research on deep equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Royal Society of Canada|title=Class of 2015 List of New Fellows|url=https://www.rsc-src.ca/sites/default/files/pdf/NF%20Citations%202015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=University of Ottawa Gazette|title=Two Professors Promoted by the Royal Society of Canada|url=https://www.uottawa.ca/gazette/en/news/two-professors-promoted-royal-society-canada|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the article Deep Equality as an Alternative to Accommodation and Tolerance (2014), Beaman contends that the conceptualization of diversity as a problem to be solved sets up a hierarchy of privilege whereby majorities or host cultures bestow tolerance or accommodation on minorities. She rejects the language of tolerance and accommodation as frameworks for the management of this "crisis of diversity,"  in favor of a model she refers to as deep equality (90).  Informed in part by political theorist [[William E. Connolly|William E. Connolly’s]] thoughts on deep pluralism and agonistic respect, Beaman’s paradigm of deep equality proposes the displacement of conflict narratives with a focus on empirical evidence from the successful negotiation of religious diversity in the quotidian. She argues that the exploration, understanding and mapping of micro-level instances of day-to-day cooperation and collaboration between ordinary people are crucial to shifting the perception of diversity as a problem to one of opportunity. Beaman engages Connolly’s notion of agnostic respect as foundational to the work of deep equality, noting that "respect is 'agonistic' because it requires the abandonment of rightness and the conviction that one is imbued with the truth through some sort of transcendent authority" (98). She also points to static representations of religion and rigid religious identities (particularly as perpetuated in the media), as well as an overreliance on law to resolve disputes as persistent impediments to the progress of deep equality. "Law," according to Beaman "has colonized the meaning of equality, watering it down and displacing it with concepts like ‘reasonable accommodation’ and tolerance" (92). Beaman argues three points: "1. That tolerance and accommodation are inappropriate frameworks to facilitate human thriving in a diverse context; 2. That a reconstituted notion of equality can subvert the binaries that are kept alive by tolerance and accommodation; 3. That positive narratives offer a map toward a renewed conceptualization of equality, and a recognition of day-to-day human activity in its constitution" (104). Beaman draws from the disciplines of law, neuroscience, philosophy, political theory, sociology, and social psychology, among others, to inform her emerging model of deep equality. She projects the utility of deep equality as a lens for exploring inequality in a broad range of areas including economics, environmental relations, gender, race, religion, and sexuality. The broad notion of respect is a recurrent theme emerging from Beaman’s research, with "the values of caring, neighborliness and shared humanity" as core components of deep equality’s emphasis on striving to live well together with difference (98). Beaman’s work on human/non-human animal relationships is likewise linked to her interest in the diversity of religious and non-religious world views and their expression in everyday interactions. She is currently conducting empirical research on the global phenomenon of sea turtle rescue, employing aspects of the [[lived religion]] approach to explore identity construction in late modernity and narratives of cooperation that emerge from human engagement with both animals and the environment.

'''''Milhamoth ha-Shem''''' ({{lang-he-n|מלחמות השם}}) or '''''Milhamoth Adonai''''' (Wars of the Lord) is the title of several Hebrew polemical texts. The phrase is taken from the [[Book of the Wars of the Lord]] referenced in {{bibleref|Numbers|21:14&amp;ndash;15}}.

Among these the most notable are:

==''Milhamoth ha-Shem'' of Salmon ben Jeroham, 10th century==
[[Solomon ben Jeroham]]'s ''The Book of the Wars of the Lord'' (also Milhamoth Adonai מלחמות אדוני), is a refutation of [[Saadya Gaon]].&lt;ref&gt;''Milhamoth ha-Shem'' of Salmon ben Jeroham, Davidson 1934&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish quarterly review  1937 "It is, therefore, with great joy that students of early Karaism will receive the first complete edition of Salmon's main polemical work, the Sifer Milhamoth ha-Shem, recently published by Prof. Davidson"&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Milhamoth ha-Shem'' of Jacob ben Reuben, 12th century==
The ''Milhamoth ha-Shem'' of [[Jacob ben Reuben (rabbi)|Jacob ben Reuben]], is a 12th-century Jewish apologia against conversion by Christians, consisting of questions and answers from selected texts of [[Gospel of Matthew]], including Matt. 1:1-16, 3:13-17, 4:1-11, 5:33-40, 11:25-27, 12:1-8, 26:36-39, 28:16-20.&lt;ref&gt;William Horbury Hebrew study from Ezra to Ben-Yehuda 1999 128&lt;/ref&gt; It served as a precedent for the full Hebrew translation and interspersed commentary on Matthew found in [[Ibn Shaprut]]'s ''[[rabbinical translations of Matthew|Touchstone]]'' c. 1385.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rosenthal (ed.), Jacob b. Reuben, Milhamoth ha-Shem (Jerusalem, 1963), pp. 141-52&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Milhamoth ha-Shem'' of Abraham, son of Maimonides, 13th century==
[[Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon]]'s ''Wars of the Lord'' is a treatise defending his father [[Maimonides]] against slander.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Israel Dienstag, Fred Rosner ''Abraham Maimonides' Wars of the Lord and the Maimonidean controversy'' 2000 - 207 "The name of the work, Milchamot Hashem, literally "The Wars of the Lord," seems to indicate that Abraham Maimonides considered it to be a divine duty to defend his father's works against the slanderers and liars..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Milchamot Hashem of Rabbi Avraham ben HaRambam'' With comments and explanations by Rabbi Reuven Margaliot. Publisher: Mossad HaRav Kook&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Milhamoth ha-Shem'' of Nachmanides, 13th century==
[[Nachmanides]]'s ''Wars of the Lord'' is a Halakhic treatise attacking Zerahiah ha-Levi's commentary on [[Isaac Alfasi|Alfasi]]. The treatise goes in great detail on the piece of Talmud at hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12552-ramban Jewish Encyclopedia on Nachmanides]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Milhamoth ha-Shem'' of Levi ben Gershom, 14th century==
The ''Wars of the Lord'', also ''Milhamoth Adonai'' (מלחמות אדוני), of [[Levi ben Gershom]], or [[Gersonides]], or "RaLBaG", (1288–1344) is a religious, astronomical and philosophical treatise.&lt;ref&gt;Levi ben Gershom ''Wars of the Lord'' translated into English by Seymour Feldman in 3 volumes (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1984, 1987, 1999) "As Gersonides tells us in his Introduction to the Wars of the Lord, he will consider in this treatise only those topics that were not adequately or completely treated by his predecessors, especially Maimonides."&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Milhamoth ha-Shem'' of Abner of Burgos (Alfonso of Valladolid), 14th century.==
[[Abner of Burgos]] (ca1260-ca1347)  was a convert to Christianity who wrote polemical works in Hebrew between 1320-1340. This text is Hebrew anti-Jewish polemic that is now lost but quotations of it survive in the Latin writing of the fifteenth-century convert Paul of Burgos (Scrutinium Scripturarum) and the polemicist Alonso de Espina (Fortalitium fidei). It served as a template for Abner's later work ʾ''Moreh Zedek'', which now survives in a Castilian translation as ''Mostrador de justicia'' and much material from the Sefer is repeated there. Abner translated the work into Castilian himself at the behest of Blanca, Lady of Las Huelgas in Burgos around the year 1320, and a copy of this translation was seen by traveller Ambrosio de Morales in Valladolid in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/ryanszpiech/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2014/08/CMR4.Szpiech.finalprint.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==''Milhamoth ha-Shem'' of Yiḥyeh Qafeḥ, 1931==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Yiḥyah Qafiḥ]] and [[Dor Daim]] and [[Amram Qorah]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
The seminal work composed by [[Yiḥyah Qafiḥ|Yiḥyeh Qafeḥ]] (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|רבי יחיא בן שלמה קאפח}}), Chief Rabbi of [[Sana'a]], Yemen and protagonist of the [[Dor Daim|Dor Deah]] movement in Orthodox Judaism. Qafeḥ's ''Milḥamot HaShem'' (1931), which he began to write in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yahadut.org.il/zohar/milhamot-hashem.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the [[Zohar]] is not authentic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3255">The '''Na''' or '''Nga''' people ({{lang-bo|ང}}) is a small tribal group residing in the higher reaches, below the great Himalayan ranges in [[Upper Subansiri]] district of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[India]]. Within the district, they are found in the villages within Taksing circle: Gumsing, Taying, Esnaya, Lingbing, Tongla, Yeja, Reding, Redi, Dadu villages. As of 2000, the tribal population stood at 1,500. However, in all official censuses the Nga are classified together with the [[Tagin people|Tagin]], who are ethnically related to them.

They speak the [[Na dialect|Na language]], a member of the [[Sino-Tibetan language family]], in which the population's literacy rate is 30%. The Na language has an affinity with the [[Tagin language]]. They also use Hindi or English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ethnologue|title=Na {{!}} Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/nbt|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Nga were believed to have migrated South from the north in Tibet following racial persecution from the Tibetans, but later engaged in trade with the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] after the [[Nishi people|Nishi]] served as a mediator between the two groups until recent times. However, relations with their neighbors were often unstable; for instance, the shift of preference of their northern Tibetan trading partners in a 1906 incident resulted in a massacre which claimed many lives from their tribal group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cult of Pure Crystal Mountain: Popular Pilgrimage and Visionary Landscape in Southeast Tibet|author=Toni Huber|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1999|pages=166–8|isbn=0-19-512007-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Nga are adherents of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] but are also influenced by pre-Buddhist Shaman practices. Both Buddhist Lamas and traditional Shamans, known as Nyibu in the native tongue, are employed for religious occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribes of Arunachal Pradesh: Identity, Culture, and Languages|author=Dalvindar Singh Grewal|publisher=South Asia Publications|year=1997|isbn=81-7433-019-4|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like most tribes living in higher elevations, they build permanent houses made of stone and cultivate the usable land. One can see villages with terraced fields growing maize, millet, barley, etc. They breed domestic animals including [[yaks]] and sheep, and their clothes are made of spun wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribes of India: Ongoing Challenges|author=Rann Singh Mann|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt. Ltd.|year=1996|isbn=81-7533-007-4|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Nga are more closely related to the Tagin both ethnically and linguistically than to Tibetans, but they claim to be a separate group, like the [[Mara (Tagin)|Mara]] who live in Limeking. However, both tribes acknowledge that they share a common ancestry with the Tagin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribes of India: Ongoing Challenges|author=Rann Singh Mann|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt.

'''Nang Kwak''' ({{lang-th|นางกวัก}}) is a spirit or household divinity of [[Thai folklore]]. She is deemed to bring good fortune, prosperity, attract customers to a business, and found among merchants.

Commonly dressed in red Thai style clothing, Nang Kwak is an incarnation of Mae Po Sop, the Thai rice goddess. She is a version of the Hindu goddess [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref name=lee892/&gt;

==Iconography==
Nang Kwak is represented as a beautiful woman wearing a red dress (not always, but more often than other colors) fashioned in the [[Thai people|Thai]] style. She also wears a golden crown on her head and is in the sitting or kneeling position. Her right hand is raised in the Thai way of beckoning a customer, with the palm of the hand curved and pointing downwards. Her left hand is resting on her side or holds a bag full of gold near her lap.

The present iconographic figure of Nang Kwak is an incarnation of [[Mae Po Sop]] (แม่โพสพ), the Siamese rice goddess.&lt;ref name=lee892/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070526103719/http://www.awakenedwoman.com/pairin_rice_mother.htm Pairin Jotisakulratana, ''Mae Po sop: The Rice Mother of Thailand'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Mae Po Sop, Nang Kwak does not wear the harvested rice [[wikt:sheaf|sheaf]] on her right shoulder. The iconography of Nang Kwak is based in the [[Hindu deities|Hindu goddess]] Sri [[Lakshmi]], the goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity.&lt;ref name=lee892&gt;Jonathan Lee, Fumitaka Matsuoka, Edmond Yee and Ronald Nakasone (2015), Asian American Religious Cultures, ABC, {{ISBN|978-1598843309}}, page 892&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of her hand in present-day iconography is similar to the [[Japan]]ese [[Maneki Neko]] beckoning [[cat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thai-amulets.com/nang_kwak.htm Nang Kwak, Background information]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
Nang Kwak is a benevolent spirit. She is deemed to bring luck, especially in the form of money, to the household. She is the patron Deity of all Merchants and Salesmen and can be seen in almost every business establishment in [[Thailand]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaiworldview.com/bouddha/animism4.htm Astrologers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thai people like to have a figurine or cloth poster ([[called a Pha Yant]], or Yantra Cloth) of this goddess in their home or shop, where it is often placed by the shrine. Some people also wear [[amulet]]s with her figure around the neck, which is a logical development, due to the fact that many people in Thailand must travel around to sell their wares, which makes a portable nang Kwak amulet the obvious choice for such a person.

==Legends==
Although Nang Kwak is more a figure of popular folklore than a religious [[deity]], there are Buddhist legends that seek to incorporate her into the Buddhist fold.

;Brahmin trading family legend
One Buddhist legend presents Nang Kwak as Nang Supawadee (or Subhavadi) of a [[Brahmin]] trading family that converted to Buddhism.&lt;ref name=wilson635&gt;Ara Wilson (2008), [http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/media2/cseas/50thAnniversary/papers/Panel3_Wilson.PDF The Sacred Geography of Bangkok’s Markets], International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, Volume 32.3, September 2008, page 635&lt;/ref&gt; According to this legend, in the small town of Michikasandhanakara, in the Indian province of Sawadtii, there was a married family, Sujidtaprahma and his wife Sumanta, who had a daughter named Supawadee. They were merchants who sold small amounts of wares on the markets, only earning just enough to maintain their small family from day to day. One day, they were discussing their hopes and dreams for the future, and decided that they should try to expand their business to make more profit and begin to think of being able to save something for their old age.

As a result of this conversation, they decided to try to afford to buy a gwian (cart) in order to use to travel with and sell their wares to other towns and villages. They also then brought wares from the other towns to sell in Sawadtii and Michigaasandhanakara when they returned. Sometimes, Supawadee would ask to tag along for the ride, and help them. One day, as Supawadee was helping her parents to sell wares in a distant town, she was lucky to be able to hear a sermon by Phra Gumarn Gasaba Thaera; she was so convinced and moved by his sermon, that she became Buddhist. When Gasaba Thaera saw her faith and devotion, he collected all his powers of thought and concentration, for he was an [[Arhat (Buddhism)|Arahant]], and bestowed blessings of good fortune and luck in salesmanship on Nang Supawadee and her family.

;Ramakian epic legend
Another Thai legend presents Nang Kwak as the woman who defended a king from a demon in the epic [[Ramakian]].&lt;ref name=wilson635/&gt; She, thereafter gained the boon (merit) of fortune and prosperity wherever she was.

Nang Kwak was the daughter of ''Pu Chao Khao Khiao'', meaning 'Grandfather Lord of the Green Mountain' (''Khao Khiao''). Pu Chao Khao Khiao was a Lord of the Chatu Maha Rachika realm (one of the lower levels of Heaven – an [[Asura]] realm of giants and [[preta]]s). His other name is 'Pra Panasabodee', and he is the Lord of the forest and places where wild plants grow. In that time, there was an Asura demon called To Kok Khanak (also known as 'To Anurak'). To Kok Khanak was a good friend of Pu Chao Khao Khiao, who had been attacked by [[Rama|Phra Ram]] (the hero of [[Ramakien]], Thai version of the Hindu epic [[Ramayana]]), who had thrown a Kok tree at him which pierced his chest and carried him through space to be pinned to the side of [[Mount Meru|Pra Sumen]]. In addition, Pra Ram cursed him with the following magic spell: 'Until your descendants weave a Civara monks robe from [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] petals, and offer it to [[Maitreya|Pra Sri Ariya Maedtrai]] (Maitreya the future Buddha) your curse will not be lifted.'{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

After this, Nang Prachant, the daughter of Lord Kok Khanag had to serve her father, spending the days and nights trying to weave a Civara robe from lotus petals, in order to have it ready for offering to Pra Sri Ariya Maedtrai who will descend to become enlightened in a future age. Meanwhile, To Kok Khanak had to remain cursed and pinned to Pra Sumen and his daughter was in a dire situation without her father to help run things. Since she had to spend all her time weaving the Civara, she had no time to sell things or make money, nor time to run a shop. When Chao Khao Khiaw heard this, he felt compassion and sent his daughter Nang Kwak to go stay with her. Because of her [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]], Nang Kwak caused merchants and rich nobles to flock to Nang Prachant's home and bestow gifts of gold, silver and money on her. Nang Prachant became wealthy and led a comfortable life.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Littlewood, ''Buddha Magic'', Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Arab]] [[folklore]], the '''Nasnas''' ({{lang-ar|النَّسْنَاس}} ''an-nasnās'') is a monstrous creature. According to [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]], the 19th century translator of ''[[The Thousand and One Nights]]'', a nasnas is "half a human being; having half a head, half a body, one arm, one leg, with which it hops with much agility". 

And also in Somali folklore there is a creature called "xunguruuf" "Hungruf" which resembles the "nasnās" as it has the same characteristics and features. It's believed it can kill a person by just touching them and the person would be fleshless in mere seconds.

It was believed to be the offspring of a [[Demon#Islam|demon]] called a '''Shiqq''' (الشق) and a human being. A character in "The Story of the Sage and the Scholar", a tale from the collection, is turned into a nasnas after a magician applies [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] to one of his eyes. The nasnas is mentioned in [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Flaubert)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]''.

'''Neferneferure''' (14th century BCE) was an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian princess of the [[18th dynasty]]. She was the fifth of six known daughters of [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]] and his [[Great Royal Wife]] [[Nefertiti]].

==Family==
Neferneferure (her name means "Beauty of the Beauties of Re" or "Most Beautiful One of Re") was born in or before the 8th regnal year of her father [[Akhenaten]] in the city of [[Akhetaten]].&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce. Nefertiti: Egypt's Sun Queen. Penguin. 1998. {{ISBN|0-670-86998-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had four older sisters named [[Meritaten]], [[Meketaten]], [[Ankhesenpaaten]] and [[Neferneferuaten Tasherit]], as well as a younger sister named [[Setepenre (princess)|Setepenre]].&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames &amp; Hudson. 2004. {{ISBN|0-500-05128-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:3daughters-Akhenaten.jpg|thumb|right|270px| From left to right: Setepenre, Neferneferure, and Neferneferuaten Tasherit at the Durbar in year 12.]]
One of the earliest depictions of Neferneferure is in a fresco from the King’s House in Amarna. She is depicted sitting on  a pillow with her sister [[Neferneferuaten Tasherit]]. The fresco is dated to ca. year 9 of [[Akhenaten]], and the entire family is depicted, including the baby [[Setepenre (princess)|Setepenre]].&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt;

Neferneferure is depicted at the Durbar in year 12 in the tomb of the Overseer of the royal quarters [[Meryre II]] in Amarna. Akhenaten and Nefertiti are shown seated in a kiosk, receiving tribute from foreign lands. The daughters of the royal couple are shown standing behind their parents. Neferure is the middle daughter in the lower register. She is holding a gazelle in her right arm and a lotus flower in her left. She is standing right behind her sister Neferneferuaten Tasherit. Her sister Setepenre is standing behind her and is shown reaching over to pet the gazelle.&lt;ref name="Murnane"&gt;Murnane, William J., Texts from the Amarna Period in Egypt, Society of Biblical Literature, 1995 {{ISBN|1-55540-966-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and burial==
Neferneferure probably died in the 13th or 14th regnal year, possibly in the plague that swept across Egypt during this time. She is absent from one scene and her name was plastered  over in another scene in the [[Royal Tomb of Akhenaten|Royal Tomb]] in [[Amarna]]. To be specific, on Wall C of the chamber &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of the Royal Tomb her name was mentioned among the five princesses (the list excluded the youngest, [[Setepenre (princess)|Setepenre]], who was possibly dead by this time), but was later covered by plaster. On Wall B of the chamber &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; she is missing from the scene which shows her parents and three elder sisters – [[Meritaten]], [[Ankhesenpaaten]] and [[Neferneferuaten Tasherit]] – mourning the dead second princess, [[Meketaten]]. This suggests that she is likely to have died shortly before the decoration of these chambers was finished.&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt; It is possible that Neferneferure was actually buried in chamber &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of the royal tomb.&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;

Alternatively she may have been buried in Tomb 29 in [[Amarna]].&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Nicholas. Akhenaten: Egypt's False Prophet. Thames &amp; Hudson. 2005. {{ISBN|0-500-28552-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is based on an amphora handle bearing an inscription mentioning the inner (burial) chamber of Neferneferure.&lt;ref name="Murnane"/&gt; If Neferneferure was buried in tomb 29, then this may mean the Royal Tomb was already sealed at the time of her burial and that she may have died after the death her father [[Akhenaten]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldred, Cyril, Akhenaten: King of Egypt ,Thames and Hudson, 1991 (paperback), {{ISBN|0-500-27621-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other objects mentioning Neferneferure==
A lid of a small box (JdE 61498) bearing her picture was found among the treasures of [[Tutankhamun]]. It shows the princess crouching, with a finger pressed to her mouth, as very young children were often depicted.&lt;ref&gt;T.G.H. James, Tutankhamun, White Star, 2000 (Barnes and Noble Books 2002), {{ISBN|1-58663-742-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this box lid Re's name in her name was written phonetically instead of the usual circled dot.

The '''Pai Mārire''' movement (commonly known as '''Hauhau''') was a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] [[Māori people|Māori]] religion or [[cult]] founded in [[Taranaki]] by the prophet '''Te Ua Haumēne'''. It flourished in the [[North Island]] from about 1863 to 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pai Mārire incorporated [[Bible|biblical]] and Māori spiritual elements and promised its followers deliverance from '[[pākehā]]' domination.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite book  | last = King| first = Michael| authorlink = Michael King|  title = The Penguin History of New Zealand| publisher = Penguin| year = 2003| location = Auckland| pages = 216–218 | isbn = 0-14-301867-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although founded with peaceful motives—its name means "Good and Peaceful"—Pai Mārire became better known for an extremist form of the religion known to the Europeans as "Hauhau".&lt;ref name=clark&gt;Paul Clark, "Hauhau: The Pai Marire Search for Maori Identity," (1975) as cited by Belich in "The New Zealand Wars" (1986), chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rise and spread of the violent expression of Pai Mārire was largely a response to the New Zealand Government's military operations against North Island Māori, which were aimed at exerting European sovereignty and gaining more land for white settlement;&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; historian B.J. Dalton claims that after 1865 Māori in arms were almost invariably termed Hauhau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Dalton | first = B.J.  | title = War and Politics in New Zealand 1855-1870| publisher =Sydney University Press |  year = 1967 | location =Sydney | pages =207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor [[George Grey]] launched a campaign of suppression against the religion in April 1865, culminating in the raiding of dozens of villages in [[Taranaki]] and on the East Coast and the arrest of more than 400 adherents, most of whom where incarcerated on the [[Chatham Islands]].  Elements of the religion were incorporated in the [[Ringatū]] or "Raised hand" religion formed in 1868 by [[Te Kooti]], who escaped from the Chatham Islands after being incarcerated there.&lt;ref name=babbage5 /&gt;

In the 2006 New Zealand Census 609 people identified "Hauhau" as their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Affiliation (Total response)|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/classification-counts-tables/about-people/~/media/Statistics/Census/2006-reports/Classification-Count-Tables/People/religious-affiliation.xls|publisher=New Zealand Department of Statistics|accessdate=29 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115113848/http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/classification-counts-tables/about-people/~/media/Statistics/Census/2006-reports/Classification-Count-Tables/People/religious-affiliation.xls|archivedate=15 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise of the prophet==
[[Image:Teua.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The prophet Te Ua Haumēne, about 1866.]]Te Ua Haumēne was born in Taranaki, New Zealand, in the early 1820s. He and his mother were captured and enslaved by a rival tribe in 1826. He learned to read and write in Māori while in captivity and began studying the [[New Testament]]. He was [[baptism|baptised]] by the Rev John Whiteley in the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] mission at [[Kawhia]] in 1834 and given the name of Horopapera Tuwhakararo, a transliteration of the name John [[Zerubbabel]].&lt;ref name=babbage1 /&gt; He later returned to Taranaki.

During the 1850s he became a supporter of the [[Māori King Movement|King Movement]], which opposed further expansion of European sovereignty and the sale of land to European settlers, and in the 1860s fought against colonial forces in the [[First Taranaki War]]&lt;ref name=Sinclair&gt;{{cite book| last = Sinclair | first = Keith | authorlink = Keith Sinclair | title = A History of New Zealand | publisher = Penguin | year = 2000| location = Auckland | isbn = 0-14-029875-4 | page = 396}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Invasion of the Waikato|Waikato War]], in which he also acted as a chaplain to the Māori soldiers. By the early 1860s Te Ua was part of a ''runanga'' (local board of management), which administered local government and also ensured that the boundary of the land that was covered by the ''[[mana]]'' of the Māori King was undisturbed.

By then the cornerstones of Te Ua's religious teaching were set. He believed Māori had a right to defend the boundaries of their territory; believed in national salvation of the Māori from the white settlers; and suspected that missionaries were aiding and abetting the loss of Māori land.

The elevation of Te Ua to the role of prophet followed an incident in September 1862 in which the British steamer ''Lord Worsley'' was wrecked off the Taranaki coast and local Māori debated what action should be taken with the cargo and crew. Te Ua &amp;ndash; then living at Wereroa Pă, near [[Waitotara]] &amp;ndash; argued that goods salvaged from the vessel should be sent to [[New Plymouth]] untouched, but was ignored and the cargo was instead plundered.&lt;ref name=babbage1 /&gt; On 5 September, aggrieved over what had taken place, he claimed to have experienced a vision in which the [[Archangel Gabriel]]&lt;ref name=Sinclair /&gt; announced to him that the [[End Times|last days]] of the [[Bible]] were at hand and that God had chosen him as a prophet who would cast out the Pākehā and restore Israel (the Māori) to their birthright in the land of [[Canaan]] (Aotearoa/New Zealand) - adding a religious aspect to the issue of Māori independence, which had until then been a purely political movement.&lt;ref name=babbage1&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BabHauH-t1-body-d1.html S. Barton Babbage, "Hauhauism: An Episode in the Maori Wars 1863-1866", chapter 1. A.H &amp; A.W. Reed, Dunedin, 1937]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are conflicting reports over Te Ua's response to the vision: he is claimed to have killed his child, explaining in a letter circulated to tribes that it was as a redemption for his people, "forgetful, desolate and in doubt".,&lt;ref name=Sinclair /&gt; while there are also claims he broke the child's leg and healed it miraculously.&lt;ref name=babbage1 /&gt; As reports about Te Ua began to circulate, he quickly gained a reputation for having other miraculous powers.&lt;ref name=babbage1 /&gt; The view among settlers was less sympathetic: Bishop William Williams claimed Te Ua showed strong signs of insanity and colonial soldier and historian T.W. Gudgeon claimed he had been thus far regarded as a "harmless lunatic" of "weak intellect, but yet of peaceful disposition".&lt;ref name=babbage1 /&gt;

==Formation and spread of the religion==

Te Ua began to formulate his new religion, complete with a holy book, ''Ua Rongo Pai'' (the Gospel according to Ua) which combined elements of [[Old Testament]] morality, Christian doctrine and traditional Māori religion. Its goal was to create a peaceful society in which righteousness and justice prevailed. They believed they were a second Chosen People and that, with divine aid, they would regain control of their hereditary land&lt;ref name=Sinclair /&gt; when the Creator, [[Jehovah]], fought for them and drove the English into the sea.&lt;ref name=babbage2&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BabHauH-t1-body-d2.html S. Barton Babbage, "Hauhauism: An Episode in the Maori Wars 1863-1866", chapter 2. A.H &amp; A.W. Reed, Dunedin, 1937]&lt;/ref&gt; To help him propagate the religion, Te Ua chose three men &amp;ndash; Tahutaki, Hepenaia and Wi Parara.

The embracing of the religion by some Māori also signalled a rejection of Christianity and a distrust of missionaries over their involvement in land purchases.&lt;ref name=babbage3&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BabHauH-t1-body-d3.html#fn1-39 S. Barton Babbage, "Hauhauism: An Episode in the Maori Wars 1863-1866", chapter 3. A.H &amp; A.W. Reed, Dunedin, 1937]&lt;/ref&gt;

The religion gained widespread support among North Island Māori and became closely associated with the [[Māori King Movement]],{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} but also became the cause of deep concern among European settlers as it welded tribes in opposition to the Pākehā&lt;ref name=Cowan1&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow02NewZ-c1.html James Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Vol II, Chapter 1, 1922]&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to inspire fierce military resistance to colonial forces, particularly during the [[Second Taranaki War]] underway at the time.

===Ahuahu attack, April 1864===

Among settlers, the existence of the new religion was brought into dramatic focus with a series of attacks in April and May 1864. On 6 April, a force led by Tahutaki and Hepenaia mounted an expedition to Ahuahu village, set amid dense bush south of [[Oakura]], near New Plymouth, believing some 
[[Pākehā]] would be delivered into their hands.&lt;ref name=babbage2 /&gt; The group surprised a combined force of 57th Regiment and the newly formed Taranaki Military Settlers, a total of 101 men, as they rested without their weapons during a mission to destroy native crops. The Māori force killed seven and wounded 12 of their enemy. The bodies of the seven dead, including their commander, Captain P.W.J. Lloyd, were stripped naked and decapitated. The leg of one of the soldiers was also removed.&lt;ref name=Wells24&gt;[http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=762&amp;page=1&amp;action=null B. Wells, The History of Taranaki, chapter 24, 1878.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The easy victory of the Māori over the numerically stronger British-led force gave a powerful impetus to the Pai Mārire movement and confirmed in the minds of many Māori the protection of the Archangel Gabriel, of whom Te Ua was now regarded as a prophet. The number of adherents swelled and Pai Mārire rites continued to develop, some incorporating the severed heads of the slain soldiers, through which Te Ua claimed to communicate with Jehovah.&lt;ref name=babbage2 /&gt;

===Assault on Sentry Hill, April 1864===

[[Image:Sentryhill.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Sentry Hill redoubt, Taranaki, 1863.]]Three weeks later, on 30 April 1864, 200 warriors demonstrated their faith in divine protection when they marched on the Sentry Hill redoubt, 9&amp;nbsp;km north-west of New Plymouth. The redoubt, on the crown of a hill, was defended by 75 imperial soldiers and two [[Coehorn|Coehorn mortars]]. Atiawa Māori viewed the construction of the outpost on their land as a challenge and formed a war party of the best fighting men from west coast iwi. When they came under fire at close range, they shielded themselves from the fusillade only by holding their right hands up and chanting. As many as a fifth of the Māori force were killed in the assault.&lt;ref name=Cowansentry&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow02NewZ-c2.html James Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Vol II, Chapter 2, 1922]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1920 interview with historian James Cowan, Te Kahu-Pukoro, a fighter who took part in the attack, explained: "The Pai-marire religion was then new, and we were all completely under its influence and firmly believed in the teaching of Te Ua and his apostles. Hepanaia Kapewhiti was at the head of the war-party. He was our prophet. He taught us the Pai-marire [[karakia]] (chant), and told us that if we repeated it as we went into battle the pakeha bullets would not strike us. This we all believed."&lt;ref name="Cowansentry" /&gt;

Led by Hepanaia, the warriors participated in sacred ceremonies around a pole at the Manutahi pā, with all the principal Taranaki chiefs present: [[Wiremu Kīngi]] and Kingi Parengarenga, as well as [[Te Whiti o Rongomai|Te Whiti]] and [[Tohu Kākahi]], both of whom would later become prophets at [[Parihaka]]. The force, armed with muskets, shotguns, tomahawks and spears, marched to Sentry Hill and at 8 am launched their attack, ascending the slope that led to the redoubt. Te Kahu-Pukoro recalled:

{{cquote|We did not stoop or crawl as we advanced upon the redoubt; we marched on upright (haere tu tonu), and as we neared the fort we chanted steadily our Pai-marire hymn.

The soldiers who were all hidden behind their high parapet, did not open fire on us until we were within close range. Then the bullets came thickly among us, and close as the fingers on my hand. The soldiers had their rifles pointed through the loopholes in the parapet and between the spaces on top (between bags filled with sand and earth), and thus could deliver a terrible fire upon us with perfect safety to themselves. There were two tiers of rifles blazing at us. We continued our advance, shooting and shouting our war-cries. Now we cried out the ‘Hapa’ (‘Pass over’) incantation which Hepanaia had taught us, to cause the bullets to fly harmlessly over us: ‘Hapa, hapa, hapa! Hau, hau, hau!  Pai-marire, rire, rire — hau!’ As we did so we held our right hands uplifted, palms frontward, on a level with our heads — the sign of the ringa-tu. This, we believed, would ward off the enemy's bullets; it was the faith with which we all had been inspired by Te Ua and his apostles.

The bullets came ripping through our ranks. ‘Hapa, hapa!’ our men shouted after delivering a shot, but down they fell. ‘Hapa!’ a warrior would cry, with his right hand raised to avert the enemy's bullets, and with a gasp — like that — he would fall dead. The tuakana (elder brother) in a family would fall with ‘Hapa!’ on his lips, then the teina (younger brother) would fall; then the old father would fall dead beside them.&lt;ref name="Cowansentry" /&gt; }}

About 34 Māori and one imperial soldier were killed.&lt;ref name="Wells24" /&gt; Among those shot dead, at almost point-blank range, were chiefs Hepanaia, Kingi Parengarenga (Taranaki), Tupara Keina (Ngatiawa), Tamati Hone (Ngati Ruanui) and Hare Te Kokai, who had advocated the frontal attack on the redoubt. According to Cowan, the slaughter temporarily weakened the new confidence in Pai-marire, but Te Ua had a satisfying explanation: that those who fell were to blame because they did not repose absolute faith in the karakia, or incantation.&lt;ref name="Cowansentry" /&gt;

===Battle of Moutoa, May 1864===

Two weeks later, on 14 May, a Pai Mārire war party from the upper [[Whanganui River]] advanced on the settlement of [[Wanganui]], intent on raiding it. In what became known as the Battle of Moutoa, Lower Whanganui ''kupapa'' (Māori loyal to the Queen) routed the war party, killing 50 of them including the prophet Matene Rangitauira.&lt;ref name=Cowan3&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow02NewZ-c3.html James Cowan, Vol.2, chapter 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relieved settlers erected New Zealand's first war memorial at the site—today known as [[Moutoa Gardens]]—with an inscription that read: "To the memory of those brave men who fell at Moutoa 14 May 1864 in defence of law and order against fanaticism and barbarism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Moutoa Gardens NZ Wars memorial | work = New Zealand History Online | publisher = History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage | date = 13 March 2013 | url = http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/moutoa-gardens-nz-wars-memorial | accessdate = 18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Coast killings, March, April 1865===

[[Image:Haumap.jpg|thumb|450px|Routes of the Pai Mārire emissaries on the North Island, 1865.]]

The reverses at Sentry Hill and Moutoa Island reinforced Māori belief in Te Ua's movement, with the conviction that the defeats had been caused by disobedience to the leader by the prophets Hepanaia and Matene. More ''iwi'' attached themselves to Te Ua. In early 1865 emissaries carrying the smoke-dried severed heads&lt;ref name=Cowan1 /&gt; were sent from Taranaki to chief [[Hirini Te Kani]] at [[Poverty Bay]] via [[Wanganui]] and [[Taupo]] in two parties &amp;ndash; one via [[Rotorua]], [[Whakatane]], [[Opotiki]], and [[East Cape]], and the other through the centre of the island via [[Ruatahuna]] and [[Wairoa]].

The emissaries were instructed to proceed peaceably and obtain the support of tribes they passed, delegating their spiritual powers to leading converts in each tribe, who each took up the duties of Pai Mārire priest.&lt;ref name=Cowan1 /&gt; But on 23 February the group clashed at [[Pipiriki]] near Wanganui with Māori loyal to the New Zealand government and determined from then to murder missionaries they encountered.&lt;ref name=babbage3 /&gt;

Among European settlers unease grew at the spreading influence of Pai Mārire. In a letter to the [[Minister of Māori Affairs|Native Minister]], the Resident Magistrate for Central Wanganui warned: "The Hauhau fanaticism is spreading very rapidly in the Province, and I fear will be the cause of great mischief. It is now the mainstay of the [[Māori King Movement|King movement]]."&lt;ref name=babbage3 /&gt;

The warning came too late to save the life of one North Island missionary. At Taupo the Pai Mārire recruiting party ransacked the house of the Rev. [[Thomas Samuel Grace]] and at Opotiki on 2 March shot, hanged and decapitated the German-born Rev. [[Carl Sylvius Völkner]]. His head was taken to the local church, where his eyes were removed and eaten by the prophet [[Kereopa Te Rau]].&lt;ref name="Sept1865"&gt;{{cite web |first = | last = |title= The Church Missionary Gleaner, September 1865|work= Death of the Rev.

Barton Babbage, "Hauhauism: An Episode in the Maori Wars 1863-1866", chapter 4. A.H &amp; A.W. Reed, Dunedin, 1937]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev Grace, who had fled from Taupo to Opotiki, was arrested and put on trial by the Pai Mārire party. He was rescued from captivity two weeks later by a British [[man-of-war]], ''HMS Eclipse'', after an attempt by local Pai Mārire leaders to exchange him for Tauranga chief [[Hori Kingi Tupaea|Hori Tupaea]], who was in prison.&lt;ref name=babbage4 /&gt;

On 22 July, Taranaki prophet Horomona led the murder of the master and two of the three crew members of the schooner ''Kate'' at Whakatane.

==Government suppression==

[[File:Patara Raukatauri (ca. 1922).jpg|right|thumb|The prophet Patara Raukatauri.]]On 29 April 1865 Governor [[George Grey]] issued a proclamation condemning the "revolting acts ... repugnant to all humanity" carried out by Pai Mārire followers and warned the government would "resist and suppress by force of arms if necessary, and by every means in my power, fanatical doctrines, rites, and practices of the aforesaid character".&lt;ref name=babbage5&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BabHauH-t1-body-d5.html S. Barton Babbage, "Hauhauism: An Episode in the Maori Wars 1863-1866", chapter 5. A.H &amp; A.W. Reed, Dunedin, 1937]&lt;/ref&gt;

Horomona and Kirimangu were hanged for their 22 July killings on the schooner ''Kate'' and a coalition of government and loyal Māori forces led by [[Hawke's Bay Province]] Superintendent [[Donald McLean (New Zealand politician)|Donald McLean]] embarked on a mission to crush the religion on the East Coast. From June to October 1865 there was a virtual civil war on the East Coast culminating in the battle of Waerenga-a-Hika in Poverty Bay in November.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; Hundreds of followers were arrested in the campaign, while in Taranaki a separate [[Second Taranaki War|campaign]] led by the increasingly reluctant British commander, General [[Duncan Alexander Cameron|Duncan Cameron]], raided dozens of villages to arrest hundreds more adherents.

In February 1866 Te Ua was captured near [[Opunake]] in Taranaki by Cameron's replacement, Major-General [[Trevor Chute]]. Chute claimed Te Ua was immediately abandoned by all those in his village, who swore an oath of allegiance to the Crown and were set free. He reported that ''kupapa'' (loyal) Māori urged his immediate execution. Te Ua was taken to Wanganui, writing en route to his North Island supporters, urging: "Let evil be brought to an end ... in order that the General may cease operations against you."&lt;ref name=babbage5 /&gt;

Te Ua and Patara were freed in Auckland and most other leaders were pardoned, but Grey transported 400 East Coast followers, including [[Te Kooti]], to the [[Chatham Islands]] for incarceration.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; Elements of Pai Mārire were later incorporated into the [[Ringatu]] religion founded by Te Kooti.

Te Ua died at [[Oeo]] in Taranaki in October 1866.

==Rites and beliefs==

Te Ua's followers identified themselves with the Jews, calling their ministers ''Teu'' (Jews) and accepted the Jewish [[seventh-day Sabbath]]. They believed they were a second Chosen People and that, with divine aid, they would return from the wilderness to freedom in their hereditary land.&lt;ref name=Sinclair /&gt; Te Ua taught that the Creator, [[Jehovah]], would fight for them and drive the English into the sea.&lt;ref name="babbage2"/&gt;

When the last of the enemy had perished, every Māori who had died since the beginning of the world would be resurrected and stand in the presence of Zerubbabel, healed of all of diseases and infirmities. Men would be sent from heaven to teach Māori all the arts and sciences known by Europeans. Their first great day of deliverance would be in December 1864.&lt;ref name="babbage2"/&gt; He urged men and women to abandon [[monogamy]] and live together communally to produce as many children as possible.&lt;ref name=babbage2 /&gt;

Services were held at a ''niu'', a tall pole, often about 18&amp;nbsp;m high, with [[Yard (sailing)|yard-arms]] from which hung ropes. The first of these ''niu'' was the mast of the ''Lord Worsley''. Members of the congregation circled the ''niu'' several times a day, chanting and touching a severed head mounted on a pole while priests conducted prayer services. Historian Babbage wrote: "The worshippers worked themselves into a state bordering on frenzy during the procedure of the ritual, until [[catalepsy]] frequently prostrated them."&lt;ref name=babbage2 /&gt;

The chants as devotees circled the ''niu'' were described by one European commentator as "a jumble of Christian and ancient concepts, of soldier and sailor terms, of English and Māori language with the barking watchword of the cult interspersed".&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Keesing, "The Changing Maori", Memoir of the Board of Maori Ethnological Research, 1928, as cited by Babbage, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The "angels of the wind" were said to be present during the service, ascending and descending the ropes dangling from the mast's yard-arm.&lt;ref name=babbage2 /&gt; By the end of 1865 a ''niu'' stood in almost every large village from Taranaki to the Bay of Plenty and from the north of the [[Wellington]] district to the [[Waikato]] frontier.&lt;ref name=Cowan1 /&gt;

===The chants===

Historian James Cowan described many of the chants as "simply meaningless strings of English words rounded into the softer [[Māori language|Māori]]; others were either transliterations or mispronunciations of parts of the [[Church of England]] services, with a sprinkling of [[Latin]] from the [[Roman Catholic]] ritual. Some phrases were military orders, picked up at the soldiers' camps. Some others showed a nautical origin; Te Ua [[Boxing the compass|boxed the compass]] like any pakeha sailor."&lt;ref name=Cowan1 /&gt;

The chant began:

:''Kira, wana, tu, tiri, wha—Teihana!
:''Rewa, piki rewa, rongo rewa, tone, piki tone—Teihana!
:''Rori, piki rori, rongo rori, puihi, piki puihi—Teihana!
:''Rongo puihi, rongo tone, hira, piki hira, rongo hira—Teihana!
:''Mauteni, piki mauteni, rongo mauteni, piki niu, rongo niu—Teihana!
:''Nota, no te pihi, no te hihi, noriti mino, noriti, koroni—Teihana!
:''Hai, kamu, te ti, oro te mene, rauna te niu—Teihana!
:''Hema, rura wini, tu mate wini, kamu te ti—Teihana!''

(Translation)

:Kill, one, two, three, four—Attention!
:River, big river, long river, stone, big stone—Attention!
:Road, big road, long road, bush, big bush—Attention!
:Long bush, long stone, hill, big hill, long hill—Attention!
:Mountain, big mountain, long mountain, big staff, long staff—Attention!
:North, north-by-east, nor'-nor'-east, nor'-east-by-north, north-east, colony—Attention!
:Come to tea, all the men, round the niu—Attention!
:Shem, rule the wind, too much wind, come to tea—Attention!&lt;ref name=Cowan1 /&gt;

===Divine protection in battle===

Te Ua taught that the divine service and strict adherence to his instruction would make them impervious to bullets if, when under fire, they would raise their right hand and cry, ''"Hapa! Hapa! Pai Mārire, hau! Hau! Hau!"'' "Hapa" meant to pass over, or ward off, while the exclamation "Hau!" at the end of the choruses &amp;ndash; said by one soldier to uttered in a way that sounded like the bark of a dog&lt;ref&gt;Lt Gudgeon, as quoted by Babbage, Ch.2&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; had a literal meaning of "wind" but referred to the life principle or vital spark of man, while the wind angels were named "Anahera hau".&lt;ref name=babbage2 /&gt;

A similar belief in the mystical power to avert bullets had earlier been reported among Islamic groups in Africa and Asia&lt;ref name=Cowan1 /&gt; and America, such as the [[Ghost Shirts|Ghost Shirt Movement]].

'''Ranakpur Jain temple''' or '''Chaturmukha Dharanavihara''' is a [[Jain]] temple at [[Ranakpur]] is dedicated to ''[[Tirthankara]]'' [[Rishabhanatha]].&lt;ref name=kumar&gt;Kumar, Sehdev (2001). ''A Thousand Petalled Lotus: Jain Temples of Rajasthan'', p. 96. Abhinav. {{ISBN|81-7017-348-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharna Shah, a local Jain businessperson, started construction of the temple in the 15th century following a divine vision.  The temple honors Adinath, the first Tirthankar of the present half-cycle (avasarpiṇī) according to Jain cosmology.  The town of Ranakpur and the temple are named after the provincial ruler monarch, Rana Kumbha who supported the construction of the temple.&lt;ref name="rpk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkativeman.com/jain-temples-ranakpur-rajasthan-india/|title=Visit the Jain Temples of Ranakpur, Rajasthan, India|accessdate=2015-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ranakpur temple is one of the largest and most important temples of Jain culture. The temple is located in a village of Ranakpur near Sadri town in the Pali district of Rajasthan. The campus includes various temples such as Chaumukha temple, Surya temple, Parsavanth temple and Amba temple&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.udaipur.org.uk/temples/ranakpur-temple.html|title=Ranakpur Temple- Ranakpur Jain Temple, Ranakpur Temples, Ranakpur Temples Rajasthan India|website=www.udaipur.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Light colored marble has been used for the construction of this grand temple which occupies an area of approximately 60 x 62 meters. The temple, with its distinctive domes, [[Sikhara|shikhara]], [[turret]]s and [[cupola]]s rises majestically from the slope of a hill. 1444 marble pillars, carved in exquisite detail, support the temple. The pillars are all differently carved and no two pillars are the same. It is also said that it is impossible to count the pillars. Also all the [[statue]]s face one or the other statue. There is one beautiful carving made out of a single marble rock where there 108 heads of [[snake]]s and numerous tails. One cannot find the end of the tails. The image faces all four cardinal directions. In the axis of the main entrance, on the western side, is the largest image. The moolnayak of this temple is a 6 feet tall white colored idol of Adinatha.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jinalaya.com/rajasthan/ranakpur.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple is designed as [[chaumukha]]—with four faces.&lt;ref name=kumar/&gt; The construction of the temple and quadrupled image symbolize the Tirthankara's conquest of the four cardinal directions and hence the [[cosmos]]. The architecture and stone carvings
of the temple is based on the Ancient [[Mirpur Jain Temple]] at [[Mirpur, Sirohi|Mirpur]] in Rajasthan.

The sun temple at Ranakpur dates back to the 13th century CE. After
its destruction, it was rebuilt in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://templenet.com/Western/ranakpur01.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple dedicated to Suparshvanatha is also present here. The temple has an intrinsic architecture and this temple is also famous for erotic arts on the wall.

[[Architecture of Rajasthan|Māru-Gurjara Architecture]] show the deep understanding of structures and refined skills of Rajasthani craftmen of bygone era. Māru-Gurjara Architecture has two prominent styles: Maha-Maru and Maru-Gurjara. According to M. A. Dhaky, Maha-Maru style developed primarily in [[Marudesa]], [[Sapadalaksha]], [[Surasena]] and parts of Uparamala whereas Maru-Gurjara originated in [[Medapata]], [[Gurjaradesa]]-[[Arbuda Mountains|Arbuda]], Gurjaradesa-[[Anarta Kingdom|Anarta]] and some areas of Gujarat. Scholars such as George Michell, M.A. Dhaky, Michael W. Meister and U.S. Moorti believe that Māru-Gurjara Temple Architecture is entirely Western Indian architecture and is quite different from the 
North Indian Temple architecture. There is a connecting link between Māru-Gurjara Architecture and Hoysala Temple Architecture. In both of these styles architecture is treated sculpturally.

==History==

The construction is well documented in a 1437 CE copper-plate record,&lt;ref&gt;R.V. Somani, jain Inscriptions of Rajasthan, Rajasthan Prakrit Bharati Sansthan, Jaipur, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; inscriptions in the temple and a [[Sanskrit]] text Soma-Saubhagya Kavya.&lt;ref&gt;Daulat Singh Lodha, Pragvat Itihas, Pragvat Itihas Prakashan Samiti, Sumerpur, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by a dream of a celestial vehicle, Dharna Shah, a [[Porwal]] from [[Ghanerao]], commenced its construction, under the patronage of [[Rana Kumbha]], then ruler of [[Mewar]]. The architect who oversaw the project was named Deepaka.  There is an inscription on a pillar near the main shrine stating that in 1439 Deepaka, an architect, constructed the temple at the direction of Dharanka, a devoted Jain.&lt;ref name=kumar/&gt; When the ground floor was completed, Acharya Soma Sundar Suri of Tapa Gachha supervised the ceremonies, which are described in ''Soma-Saubhagya Kavya''. The construction continued until 1458 CE. However, according to the audio guide provided to visitors to the site, construction lasted fifty years (and involved 2,500 workers). Another source reports that construction continued until 1496, fifty years from 1446&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ranakpurtemple.com/about-the-ranakpur.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

The temple underwent periodic renovations. Several families supported the construction of devakulikas and mandaps. The descendants of Dharna Shah now mainly live in [[Ghanerao]]. The temple has been managed by the [[Anandji Kalyanji Trust|Anandji Kalyanji Pedhi]] trust for the past century.&lt;ref&gt;Sheth Ananadji kalyanji Pedhino Itihas, Part 2, Ratilal Dipchand Desai, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regina Derieva''' ({{lang-rus|Реги́на Ио́сифовна Дери́ева|p=rʲɪˈɡʲinə ɪˈosʲɪfəvnə dʲɪˈrʲijɪvə|a=Ryegina Iosifovna Dyeriyeva.ru.vorb.oga}}; February 7, 1949 – December 11, 2013) was a [[Russia]]n [[poet]] and [[writer]] who published around thirty books of [[poetry]], [[essay]]s, and [[prose]]. From July 1999 until her death she lived in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/kultur/kultursvepet-16-december_8828244.svd?sidan=3 |title=Poeten Regina Derieva har gått bort}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Brodsky]] called Derieva "a great poet", stressing that her poems are hers "only by name, only by her craft". "The real authorship belongs here to poetry itself, to freedom itself. I have not met anything similar for a long time, neither among my fellow countrymen nor among English-speaking poets".  [[Tomas Venclova]] has stated that " Regina Derieva was, first and foremost, a Christian poet, a worthy heir of a long line of metaphysical poets, be they English, French or Russian. Far from any inflated rhetoric or didactics, her poems reached the very core of the Christian experience, which meant serious and fearless attitude to life, suffering and death. The imagery and syntax of the Gospels and the Books of Prophets was, for her, a natural element just as apocalyptic presentiments and mystical hope formed the axis of her world-outlook".  [[Les Murray (poet)|Les Murray]] has a blurb on the back cover of Derieva's ''Alien Matter'' :  ”Science teaches that eighty percent of the universe consists of dark matter, so called. Regina Derieva learned this same fact in a very hard school. She does not consent to it, though. She knows that the hurt truth in us points to a dimension where, for example, victory is cleansed of battle. Her strict, economical poems never waver from that orientation”.

Derieva's work has been translated into several languages, including [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and other languages. A [[compact disc]] with her readings in Russian of selected poems was issued in 1999. Derieva's work has appeared in the ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine, ''[[Evergreen Review]],'' ''[[Modern Poetry in Translation]],'' ''Poetry East,'' ''[[The Liberal]],'' ''[[Ars Interpres]],'' ''Salt Magazine,'' ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]],'' ''[[Notre Dame Review]],'' ''Dublin Poetry Review,'' ''[[Quarterly Literary Review Singapore]],'' ''[[Words Without Borders]],'' ''[[St. Petersburg Review]],'' ''[[Poetry International]],'' ''[[Artful Dodge]],'' ''[[Atlanta Review]],'' ''POEM Magazine,'' ''[[The Hopkins Review]],'' ''[[The American Poetry Review]]'' as well as in many Russian and Swedish magazines.

She translated poetry by [[Thomas Merton]] and contemporary [[United States|American]], [[Australian]], [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Poland|Polish]], and [[Sweden|Swedish]] poets. [[Singapore Writers Festival|Regina Derieva participated in a number of Swedish and international poetry festivals]].

Derieva's poetry is strongly affected by her Catholic faith. In 1996, a significant Italian  composer and organist, Fra [[Armando Pierucci]],  composed a cantata for the series  of Regina Derieva's poems.  This cantata is titled ''[[Via Crucis]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.divine-art.com/CD/27002info.htm pilgrims star 27002 Via Crucis. &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402233219/http://www.divine-art.com/CD/27002info.htm |date=2008-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.merton.org/itms/fellows%20research.htm In 2003, she received the Shannon Fellowship of the International Thomas Merton Society]. In 2009, the Catholic Church of Sweden awarded her the ORA ET LABORA medal for her literary work to benefit the Church.

Regina Derieva's funeral took place on December 23, 2013, and she is buried at the [[Norra Begravningsplatsen|Norra Begravningsplatsen (Katolska Kyrkogården)]] in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gravar.se/Katolska%20Kyrkog%C3%A5rden%20I%20Stockholm/1679/Regina+Joseph%20Derieva|title=Regina Joseph Derieva|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129115237/http://gravar.se/Katolska%20Kyrkog%C3%A5rden%20I%20Stockholm/1679/Regina+Joseph%20Derieva|archivedate=2014-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Regina Derieva's gravestone, Stockholm 2014.jpg|thumb|left| Regina Derieva's gravestone]] The volume of poetry, memoirs, essays, fiction, and photographs in honor of Regina Derieva, ''Curator Aquarum'', was published in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookhaven.stanford.edu/2015/02/remembering-regina-derieva-not-until-the-partys-over-we-learn-the-names-of-the-guests/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her papers are at Stanford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/thedish/2014/10/13/34965/|title=Stanford University Libraries acquires archives of poet Regina Derieva}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1468301.ece|title=Rediscovering Regina Derieva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide variety of peoples inhabiting Georgia has meant a correspondingly rich array of active religions. Today most of the population in Georgia practices [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]], primarily in the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] whose faithful make up 82.4% of the population. Around 1% belong to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], while about 3.9% of the population follow the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] ([[Oriental Orthodoxy]]), almost all of which are ethnic Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationmaster.com/country/gg-georgia/rel-religion&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of Islam make up 10.7% of the population&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gg.html CIA - The World Factbook - Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt; and are mainly found in the [[Adjara]] and [[Kvemo Kartli]] regions and as a sizeable minority in [[Tbilisi]]. [[Catholics]] of the Armenian and Latin churches make up around 0.8% of the population and are mainly found in the south of Georgia and a small number in Tbilisi. There is also a sizeable [[Jewish]] community in Tbilisi served by two synagogues.

The Georgian Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church is one of the world's most ancient Christian Churches, founded in the 1st century by the Apostle [[Saint Andrew|Andrew the First Called]]. In the first half of the 4th century [[Christianity]] was adopted as the state religion. This has provided a strong sense of national identity that has helped to preserve a national Georgian identity, despite repeated periods of foreign occupation and attempted assimilation.

Georgia has a long history of religious harmony within its borders despite the historical conflicts with the surrounding nations. Different religious minorities have lived in Georgia for thousands of years and religious discrimination is virtually unknown in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Spilling, Michael. Georgia (Cultures of the world). 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish communities exist throughout the country, with major concentrations in the two largest cities, Tbilisi and Kutaisi. Azerbaijani groups have practiced Islam in Georgia for centuries, as have Adjarians and some of the [[Abkhazians]] concentrated in their respective autonomous republics. The Armenian Apostolic Church, whose doctrine differs in some ways from that of Georgian Orthodoxy, has autocephalous status.

==Religious demography==
The country has a total area of approximately 25,900 square miles (69,700&amp;nbsp;km²), and a population ({{as of | 2014 | lc = on}}) of 3.7 million people.

According to a 2014 census, 83.4% of the Georgian population identified themselves as [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]], 10.7% [[Muslim]], 3.9% [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], and 0.5% [[ Catholic Church|Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://geostat.ge/cms/site_images/_files/english/population/Census_release_ENG_2016.pdf |title= საქართველოს მოსახლეობის საყოველთაო აღწერის საბოლოო შედეგები |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 28 April 2016 |website= |publisher= National Statistics Office of Georgia |access-date= 29 April 2016 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox churches serving other non-Georgian ethnic groups, such as Russians and Greeks, are subordinate to the Georgian Orthodox Church. Non-Georgian Orthodox Churches generally use the language of their communicants.

In addition, there are a small number of mostly ethnic Russian believers from two dissenter Christian movements: the ultra-Orthodox [[Old Believers]], and the [[Spiritual Christianity|Spiritual Christians]] (the [[Molokan]]s and the [[Doukhobor]]s). The majority of these groups have left the country since the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=lohm&gt;Hedwig Lohm, "Dukhobors in Georgia: A Study of the Issue of Land Ownership and Inter-Ethnic Relations in [[Ninotsminda]] rayon ([[Samtskhe-Javakheti]])". November 2006. Available in [http://www.ecmi.de/download/working_paper_35_en.pdf English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602192825/http://www.ecmi.de/download/working_paper_35_en.pdf |date=2010-06-02 }} and [http://www.ecmi.de/download/working_paper_35_rus.pdf Russian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902195014/http://www.ecmi.de/download/working_paper_35_rus.pdf |date=2010-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Soviet (council) | Soviet]] rule (1921-1990), the number of active churches and priests declined sharply and religious education became nearly nonexistent. Membership in the Georgian Orthodox Church has increased markedly since independence in 1991. The church maintains 4 theological seminaries, 2 academies, several schools, and 27 church dioceses; it has 700 priests, 250 monks, and 150 nuns. The [[Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia]], [[Ilia II]], with his seat in [[Tbilisi]], heads the  Church.

Several religions, including the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Catholic Church, [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]], traditionally have coexisted with Georgian Orthodoxy. A large number of [[Armenia]]ns live in the southern Javakheti region, in which they constitute a majority of the population. Islam is prevalent among [[Azerbaijan]]i and north Caucasus ethnic communities in the eastern part of the country and also is found in the regions of [[Adjara]] and [[Abkhazia]].

[[Judaism]], which has been present since ancient times, is practiced in a number of communities throughout the country, especially in the largest cities, Tbilisi and Kutaisi. Approximately 8,000 Jews remain in the country, following two large waves of emigration, the first in the early 1970s and the second in the period of [[perestroika]] during the late 1980s. Before then, Jewish officials estimate, Georgia had as many as 100,000 Jews. There also are small numbers of [[Lutheran]] worshippers, mostly among descendants of [[Germany|German]] communities that first settled in the country from 1817. A small number of the ethno-religious group of the  [[Yezidi]]s have lived in the country for centuries.

Since the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] (1991), [[Protestant]] denominations have become more prominent. They include [[Baptists]] (composed of Russian, Georgian, Armenian, Ossetian, and Kurdish groups); [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]; [[Pentecostal]]s (both Georgian and Russian); the [[New Apostolic Church]]; and the [[Assemblies of God]]. There also are a few [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], [[Hare Krishnas]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (local representatives state that the group has been in the country since 1953 and has about 15,000 adherents{{cn|date=December 2016}}). There are no available membership numbers for these groups but, combined, their membership most likely{{or|date=December 2016}} totals fewer than 100,000 persons.

==Christianity==
{{main article|Christianity in Georgia (country)|Georgian Orthodox Church}}
[[File:Raising of Lazarus.jpg|150px|thumb|A page from a rare Georgian [[bible]], dating from AD 1030, depicting the Raising of Lazarus]]
According to Orthodox tradition, Christianity was first preached in Georgia by the [[Apostles]] Simon and Andrew in the 1st century. It became the state religion of [[Caucasian Iberia|Kartli (Iberia)]] in 337.&lt;ref name="Toumanoff1963"&gt;[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyril]], "Iberia between Chosroid and Bagratid Rule", in ''Studies in Christian Caucasian History'', Georgetown, 1963, pp. 374–377. Accessible online at [http://rbedrosian.com/Ref/Toumicb/toumicb.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rapp2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rapp|first=Stephen H., Jr|title=The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWp9JA3aBvcC&amp;pg=PA137|accessdate=11 May 2012|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-3361-9|page=138|chapter=7 - Georgian Christianity}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion of Kartli to Christianity  is credited to [[St. Nino]] of [[Cappadocia]]. The [[Georgian Orthodox Church]], originally part of the [[Church of Antioch]], gained its [[autocephaly]] and developed its doctrinal specificity progressively between the 5th and 10th centuries. The [[Bible]] was also translated into Georgian in the 5th century, as the [[Georgian alphabet]] was developed for that purpose. As was true elsewhere, the Christian church in Georgia was crucial to the development of a written language, and most of the earliest written works were religious texts. From the first centuries C.E., the cult of [[Mithraism|Mithras]], [[paganism|pagan]] beliefs, and [[Zoroastrianism]] were commonly practiced in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/georgia-iii-art-and-archeology-|title=GEORGIA iii. Iranian elements in Georgian art and archeology|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity gradually replaced all the former religions except Zoroastrianism, which became somewhat of a second established religion in Iberia after the [[Peace of Acilisene]] in 378,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=riW0kKzat2sC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=zoroastrianism+georgia+sassanid&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fw2mVI-cLobbaq_QgIgD&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=zoroastrianism%20georgia%20sassanid&amp;f=false|title=The Making of the Georgian Nation|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which placed Georgians permanently on the front line of conflict between the Islamic and [[Christian world]]s. Georgians remained mostly Christian despite repeated invasions by Muslim powers, and long episodes of foreign domination. After Georgia was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] took over the Georgian church in 1811.

The Georgian church regained its autocephaly only when Russian rule ended in 1917. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet regime]] that ruled Georgia from 1921 did not consider revitalization of the Georgian church an important goal, however. Soviet rule brought severe purges of the Georgian church hierarchy and frequent repression of Orthodox worship. As elsewhere in the Soviet Union, many churches were destroyed or converted into secular buildings. This history of repression encouraged the incorporation of religious identity into the strong nationalist movement and the quest of Georgians for religious expression outside the official, government-controlled church. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, opposition leaders, especially [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]], criticized corruption in the church hierarchy. After Ilia II became the patriarch (catholicos) of the Georgian Orthodox Church in the late 1970s, Georgian Orthodoxy experienced a revival. In 1988 Moscow permitted the patriarch to begin consecrating and reopening closed churches, and a large-scale restoration process began. The Georgian Orthodox Church has regained much power and full independence from the state since the restoration of Georgia's independence in 1991. It is not a state religion, but its special status is recognized by the [[Concordat of 2002]].

Apart from the Georgian Orthodox Church, Christianity in Georgia is represented by followers of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and a [[Georgian Catholic Church]] which mostly follows either the [[Latin Rite]] or the Armenian rite.

A 2015 study estimates some 1,300 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnstone|first1=Patrick|last2=Miller|first2=Duane|title=Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background: A Global Census|journal=IJRR|date=2015|volume=11|page=14|url=https://www.academia.edu/16338087/Believers_in_Christ_from_a_Muslim_Background_A_Global_Census|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{main article|Islam in Georgia (country)}}
[[Image:Mosque in Tbilisi.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Mosque]] in [[Tbilisi]]]]
[[File:Ermakov. Botanical Street and Sunnite Mosque. Middle of 1880.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Botanical Street and Sunnite Mosque, Tbilisi. Middle of 1880]]
Islam in Georgia was introduced in 645 AD during the reign of third Caliph of [[Islam]], [[Uthman]]. During this period, Tbilisi (''al-Tefelis'') grew into a center of trade between the [[Islam]]ic world and [[northern Europe]]. Islam's history continued in Georgia throughout the late 14th and early 15th centuries with [[Timur's invasions of Georgia]] and during the 16th and early 19th centuries, the Iranians ([[Safavids]], [[Afsharids]], [[Qajars]]) and [[Ottomans]] commanded influence in the region until its annexation by Russia in 1801. In 1703, [[Vakhtang VI]] became the ruler of the [[kingdom of Kartli]] and he embraced Islam. Other notable [[Islam in Georgia|Georgian Muslims]] from that era include [[David XI of Kartli]],  [[Jesse of Kakheti]]&lt;ref&gt;A history of the Georgian people, By William Edward David Allen, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Simon II of Kartli]].

[[Muslim]]s constitute 9.9%,&lt;ref&gt;Religion and education in Europe: developments, contexts and debates, By Robert Jackson, pg.67&lt;/ref&gt; or 463,062 of the Georgian population. There are two major [[Muslim]] groups in Georgia. The ethnic Georgian Muslims are [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] and are concentrated in [[Adjara|Autonomous Republic of Adjara]] of Georgia bordering [[Turkey]]. The ethnic [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] Muslims are predominantly [[Shia]] [[Ithna 'ashariyah|Ithna Ashariyah]] and are concentrated along the border with [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]].

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Georgian Jews}}
The Jews have a history in Georgia extending back over 2000 years. Today there is a small Jewish community in the country (3,541 according to the 2002 census),&lt;ref&gt;2002 population census, [http://www.statistics.ge/_files/english/census/2002/Religious%20beliefs.pdf Population by Religious Beliefs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304163218/http://www.statistics.ge/_files/english/census/2002/Religious%20beliefs.pdf |date=2009-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Jewish population was over 100,000 as recently as the 1970s. Especially following the collapse of the Soviet Union, almost all of the country's Jews have left, mainly to [[Israel]]. The majority of Georgia's remaining Jews today live in Tbilisi and are served by its two synagogues. Because the size of the community is now so small, and for economic reasons, the two congregations are now housed on two storeys of one of the formerly separate synagogues.

==Bahá'í Faith==
{{main article|Bahá'í Faith in Georgia}}
The history of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] in Georgia begins with its arrival in the region in 1850 through its association with the precursor religion the [[Bábí]] Faith during the lifetime of [[Bahá'u'lláh]].&lt;ref name="azer2"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Balci | first = Bayram| last2 =  Jafarov | first2 = Azer| title = Who are the Baha’is of the Caucasus? {Part 1 of 3} | newspaper = Caucaz.com | pages = | date = 2007-02-20| url =http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=299| postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Religious freedom==
{{main article|Religious freedom in Georgia}}
The Georgian Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. Citizens generally do not interfere with traditional religious groups; however, there have been reports of violence and discrimination against nontraditional religious groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7658">In [[ancient Rome]], '''''res divinae''''', singular '''''res divina''''' ([[Latin]] for "divine matters," that is, the service of the gods), were the laws that pertained to the religious duties of the state and its [[Roman magistrates|officials]].  [[Roman law]] was divided into the ''res divina'' and ''[[res publica]]'', the divine and public or political spheres, the latter phrase being the origin of the English word "[[republic]]." ''Res divina'' also means, as a technical term, [[ritual sacrifice]].

In the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman system of belief]], ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#religio|religio]]'' was the acknowledgement of superiors through ''honores'' (honours). ''Caelestes honores'' ("heavenly honours") were offered to the gods, and very occasionally to mortals whose actions had earned great benefits for mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al'', Vol. 1, 77-9: early, fragmentary evidence from [[Ennius]] suggests that Romans of the 2nd century BCE were familiar with the "Greek" idea of the [[Olympian gods]] as originally mortal, elevated to posthumous godhead by honours and worship.&lt;/ref&gt; Earthly hierarchies reflected the celestial order.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 25-6,  gives secular examples of “honours-for-benefactions” as the transactional relations between master and slave, [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron and client]], and cities and their benefactors.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cicero]], who was both a [[Roman senate|senator]] and [[augur]], investigates the nature of ''res divinae'' and ''res humanae'' (human affairs) in his treatise ''De natura deorum'' ("On the nature of the gods"). He makes no attempt to develop an internally consistent system in which the rituals of ''res divinae'' might be modified by “higher truths” of doctrine or revelation. He concludes that even if the nature and existence of the gods cannot be proved beyond doubt, it is wise and pragmatic to honour them by piously offering the time-hallowed rites. Rome's continued success might depend on it.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero appears to be influenced by the works of his friend [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], the prolific writer and philosopher.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's reasoning offers a stark contrast to later [[Judaeo-Christian]] definitions of religion as spiritual and godly in contrast — or opposition — to those things regarded as material and temporal.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 4-6: citing Cicero, ''Natura Deorum''  2.3.82 and 2.28.72 and {{Bibleverse||Matthew|22:16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Res divina'' is an example of [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion|ancient Roman religious terminology]] that was taken over and redefined for Christian purposes, in this case by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Den Boeft. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1583442 Some Etymologies in Augustine's De Civitate Dei X]" Vigiliae Christianae 1979 p. 250. Accessed on [[JSTOR]] 26 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In Augustinian usage, ''res divina'' is a "divine reality" as represented by a ''sacrum signum'' ("sacred sign") such as a [[sacrament]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Vorgrimler, ''Sacramental Theology'' (Patmos, 1987, 1992), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Res Divinae'' of Varro==
The multivolume ''[[Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum]]'' was one of the chief works of [[Varro]] (1st century BC), who was the major source on traditional Roman religion for the [[Church Fathers]]. It was a particular target of [[Christian apologetics|polemic]] for Augustine, who incidentally preserves much of what is known about its content and structure. Varro devoted 25 books of the ''Antiquitates'' to ''res humanae'' ("human affairs") and 16 to ''res divinae''. His emphasis is deliberate; he treats cult and ritual as human constructs,&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]], "Religion and ''ius publicum''," in ''Religion and Law in Classical and Christian Rome'' (Franz Steiner, 2006), pp. 140–142.&lt;/ref&gt; and divides ''res divinae'' into three kinds:
* the mythic theology of the poets, or narrative elaboration;
* the natural theology of the philosophers, or theorizing on divinity (an elite activity to which ordinary people should not be exposed, lest they come to doubt the sacredness of social and religious institutions);
* the civil theology concerned with the relation of the state to the divine.
This schema is [[Stoicism|Stoic]] in origin, but Varro adapts it to the political and cultural concerns of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Gian Biagio Conte, ''Latin Literature: A History''  (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994, originally published 1987 in Italian), p. 213 [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJGp_dkXnuUC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=augustine+%22res+divinae%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=augustine%20%22res%20divinae%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious background==
The heart of Rome’s natural order was the city of Rome, home to the gods of state, their cults and their senior priest-officials, who in the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] were the ruling [[Roman consul|consuls]].  Rome’s most powerful god, ''Jupiter Optimus Maximus'' (Jupiter greatest and best) favoured “his” city because his own power and status were constructed by the Roman law, rites and sacrifice which elevated and honoured him. The same principles constructed the various powers and honours of all other gods of the state pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 27-8: the "construction" of divinity as a relative category of status by the agency of honours and worship draws on the highly influential work of [[Varro]], whose stress on the need to conceal such knowledge from the [[plebs|common people]] would lead to accusations of cynicism and manipulation.&lt;/ref&gt; Public cults (''sacra publica'') were state funded, at least in principle, and most priesthoods occupied by high-ranking citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Presiding cult priest-magistrates provided a proportion of funding, as a duty of office.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 9-13: citing legal definitions from Festus (epitome of Verrius Flaccus) “De verborum significatu” p.284 L: in Wissowa, 1912, 398ff: and Geiger, 1914).&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaic Rome was part of a broader civilisation which included Latin, colonial Greek and possibly Carthaginian elements, dominated by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] - the rites of the ''[[haruspex]]'', for example, were almost certainly Etruscan.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al'', Vol 1, 12: archaeological evidence in the city of Rome, dating to the 6th century BCE, equates Roman [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] to Greek [[Hephaistos]].&lt;/ref&gt; In its ascendancy from local to Imperial power, Rome pragmatically embraced the local cults of its neighbouring villages and towns, then of city-states and provinces. Local cult became an instrument of Roman administration, run by locally elected official-priests. Their "foreign" gods never became gods of the Roman state as a whole, but were an essential feature of reciprocal relations between Rome and its provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 8-9, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In approximately 155 CE, [[Aelius Aristides]] would remark that his own favourite gods, Asclepius, Isis and Serapis, were widely revered in the Empire ''because'' of the favour shown them by Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2730">'''Senius and Aschius''' are the two legendary founders of [[Siena]], Italy. They were brothers, sons of [[Remus]],{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Accordingly, [[Numitor]], king of [[Alba Longa]], would have been his great-grandfather. Their maternal grandfather would have been either [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] or [[Hercules]], depending on which version of the tale is referenced.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus [[Romulus]] was their uncle.
[[Image:Siena-Stemma.png|thumb|120px|Sienese coat of arms]]
[[File:Palazzo Pubblico affresco e lupa.JPG|thumb|left|Lupa in [[Palazzo Pubblico, Siena]]]]

Traditions developed in Siena, which can not be documented prior to the 16th century hold that after Romulus murdered their father during the [[Founding of Rome|Foundation of Rome]], Senius (who gave name to the city) and his brother Aschius were forced to flee Rome on horseback, riding respectively on a black horse and a white one, giving rise to the colors on the Balzana, the [[coat of arms]] of Siena.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wUcVh3moXIAC Urban Legends: Civic Identity and the Classical Past in Northern Italy, 1250 -1350]; by Carrie E. Benes, Pennsylvania University Press, 2011. page 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tellings of the legend hold that the brothers were protected by the Gods with a white cloud during the day and a dark cloud at night. They also claim the brothers stole the statue of the [[Capitoline Wolf]] from the Temple of Apollo in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=54cYuI6aRuoC Art in Renaissance Italy], by John T. Paoletti, Gary M. Radke, Laurence Publishing Company, 71 Great Russell Street, London (2006) page 99.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the brothers were descendants of Remus, Siena did have a claim to be descendants of one of the siblings nurtured by the she-wolf (lupa), which serves as a symbol of Rome.

The [[Porta Camollia, Siena|Porta Camollia]], in the Walls of Siena, is putatively named after an emissary or soldier sent to lure the brothers back to Rome, but who elected to stay instead.

One role of the legend is to grant the Sienese a noble and ancient ancestry; Rome itself had sought such a pedigree with the story of the [[Aeneid]] of [[Virgil]]. Many cities in the Italian peninsula seeking pre-eminence, such as Venice and Florence, also looked for a foundation story to link their city to greatness. It is possible that the black and white colors and history were meant to try to maintain a common bond even among the fractious Sienese, especially when torn by [[Guelf]] and [[Ghibelline]] civil strife and factionalism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">While there are many historical and modern schools of [[Taoism]], with different teachings on the subject, it is safe to say that many [[Taoist priest]]s regard their diet as extremely important to their physical, mental and spiritual health in one way or another, especially where the amount of [[qi]] in the food is concerned.

==Fasting==
{{Main|Fasting}}
Some early Taoist diets called for ''[[Bigu (avoiding grains)|bigu]]'' ({{zh|s=辟谷|t=辟穀 |p=bìgǔ |w=pi-ku|l=avoiding grains}}), based on the belief that immortality could be achieved in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (1993), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Taoist texts of the ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' suggest that individuals who attained the state of complete [[Taoism#Naturalness|ziran]] would not need food at all, but instead could sustain themselves by absorbing the cosmic [[qi]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hendrischke, University of California Press, Scripture on Great Peace, sect 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vegetarianism==

The Chinese word for food or dishes, ''cai'' ({{zh|t=[[wiktionary:菜|菜]]}}) originally means [[green vegetables]]. The invention of the vegetarian food [[tofu]] was credit to a Taoist. Taoist religious orders and literatures often encourage practitioners&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinavegan.com/2013/09/2013090919203340.htm&lt;/ref&gt; to be vegetarian to minimize harms, because all life forms are considered sentient.&lt;ref name="Zai 2015"&gt;Dr Zai, J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-WzMCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover1 ''Taoism and Science: Cosmology, Evolution, Morality, Health and more'']. Ultravisum, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Taoist levels of dietary restriction, however, are varied.

'''Tell Sukas''' (ancient '''Shuksi''' or '''Suksi''') is a [[Late Bronze Age]] [[Tell (archaeology)|archaeological mound]] on the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] coast about {{convert|6|km|mi}} south of [[Jableh]], [[Syria]].

==Overview==
Tell Sukas was located at the center of the fertile plain of Jableh on a hill with access to two natural harbors.&lt;ref name="Aubet"&gt;Aubet, 2001, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of an earlier [[Neolithic]] settlement at the site dating back to the seventh or sixth millennium BC.&lt;ref name="Tobias"&gt;Fischer-Hansen, 1991, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  The site was identified as ancient Suksi, which was mentioned in the [[Ugarit]] tablets and was probably the southernmost port of the Kingdom of Ugarit.&lt;ref name="Bromiley"&gt;Bromiley, 1995, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bronze Age]] settlement was probably destroyed along with the capital, Ugarit, during the [[Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Drews|Drews]], 1995, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The site was reused shortly thereafter and commercial activity at the [[Iron Age]] settlement can be traced again to at least the tenth century BC,&lt;ref name="Aubet"/&gt; when it became the port of [[Luhuti]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bNvovfA4o_4C&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Crafts and Images in Contact: Studies on Eastern Mediterranean Art of the First Millennium BCE|author= Claudia E. Suter, Christoph Uehlinger|page= 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] settlement was established in the eighth century BC&lt;ref&gt;Horden; Purcell, 2000, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; and the town thrived as a [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] trading outpost between c. 850 BC and c. 550 BC, when it was destroyed by the [[Babylonians]].&lt;ref name="Bromiley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuplin, 1996, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Recent excavations reveal that the site was inhabited again by the Phoenicians between 380 and 69 BC until it was destroyed again, possibly by an earthquake. It was later re-occupied for a short period by the [[Crusaders]].&lt;ref name="Tobias"/&gt;

==Excavation==
The site was excavated in 1958–1963 by the Danish Carlsberg Expedition to Phoenicia under [[P.J. Riis]]. Excavations uncovered an early Iron Age cemetery south of the tell which was dated to between the 13th and 10th century BC. Excavations also uncovered a large seventh-century Phoenician temple. The abundance of Greek pottery and the discovery of Greek burial grounds suggest that the city became a permanent Hellenic outpost by 600 BC.&lt;ref name="Aubet"/&gt;

In the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'', Favazza wrote that "This is a very fair and respectful book.... The book sets a new standard of excellence for works on religion and psychology. Although it lacks any biological or psychiatric focus, I highly recommend it to colleagues who desire to organize their thoughts about religion." (p.&amp;nbsp;988&lt;ref name=favazza98/&gt;).

In ''The Gerontologist'', George wrote that it was 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Best book that I have read on religion from a psychosocial perspective. As the title indicates, the primary focus of this volume is examination of the links between religion and coping. One of the important qualities of this book is that there is no effort to view religion as one form of coping or to view coping as a manifest function of religion. Each concept is treated in careful conceptual and empirical detail, and the links that emerge testify to the importance of each, separately and jointly. The scope of the book is encyclopedic. I could not identify a question that I had that was not addressed. (p. 508&lt;ref name=george98/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', McFadden wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This book represents a major theoretical and empirical contribution not only to the psychology of religion and clinical/counseling psychology but to other fields as well. Along with psychologists, persons in religious professions can learn much from Pargament. Mental health professionals, who traditionally have shunned religion in their own lives and in the lived experience of their clients, might be persuaded by Pargament's broadband approach to investigate how religion operates in the tales of coping and crisis they hear on a daily basis. (p. 368&lt;ref name=mcfadden98/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
She added that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This book is also appropriate for use in courses on the psychology of religion. My students have responded positively to Pargament's careful exposition of his theory, the support he offers in examples from his research and clinical practice, and his engaging use of metaphor. (pp. 368-369&lt;ref name=mcfadden98/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', McIntosh wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The weaknesses of this book are a function of its strengths. By aiming for a wide audience the book must cover a lot of ground, some of which is elementary review for some of the readership. The book probes deeply into the complexities of the topic and is encyclopedic in its coverage of the research; it is therefore somewhat daunting in size. By not avoiding the theoretical controversies and empirical weaknesses in this area, the conclusions are sometimes uncertain and the implications more muddy than in less open-eyed, more partisan work.... I highly recommend this book to scholars and practitioners of psychology and religion. It will likely be a long wait until another such impressive work in this area appears. (pp. 702-703&lt;ref name=mcintosh99/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Vincent Newton Turvey''' (1873-1912) was a British [[clairvoyant]] and [[engineer]] known in the field of [[parapsychology]] for his early book that records his [[out-of-body experience]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rodger. (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies''. McFarland &amp; Company. p. 175. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Turvey suffered from serious health problems, he gave up his profession of engineering and took interest in [[occult]] philosophy and [[yoga]]. His book ''The Beginnings of Seership'' (1911) records his alleged clairvoyant and out-of-body experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Harvey J. (1985). ''Flight of Mind: A Psychological Study of the Out-Of-Body Experience''. p. 45 {{ISBN|978-0810817371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Khordadbeh]] mentions Waqwaq twice: "East of China are the lands of Waqwaq, which are so rich in gold that the inhabitants make the chains for their dogs and the collars for their monkeys of this metal. They manufacture tunics woven with gold. Excellent ebony wood is found there. And again: Gold and ebony are exported from Waqwaq."&lt;ref name="Lunde"&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200504/the.seas.of.sindbad.htm Saudi Aramco World: The Seas of Sindbad], [[Paul Lunde]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Jan de Goeje]] offered an etymology that interpreted it as a rendering of a Cantonese name for [[Japan]]. [[Gabriel Ferrand]] identified it with [[Madagascar]], [[Sumatra]] or [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="Lunde"/&gt;

[[File:Al-Idrisi's world map.JPG|thumb|[[Al-Idrisi]]'s world map from 1154. Wāḳwāḳ is shown in the south at the top of the map.]]
Wāḳwāḳ is referred to in a number of sources, it is generally an island far away.

==The waqwaq tree==
''[[Tongdian|T’ung-tien]]'' by [[Du Huan|Ta Huan]] mentions an Arab account of a tree growing little children. In later Arab versions, the tree is named waqwaq. An [[Al Andalus|Andalusi]] versions mentions beautiful women as the fruit of the tree.&lt;ref name="Lunde"/&gt;

Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990), pp 205-8, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Serer creation myth]], Yaboyabo takes its name from the first [[human]] couple&lt;ref name="Grav"/&gt; ([[YAAB and YOP]],&lt;ref name="Gen"/&gt; var : ''YAAB'' and ''YOB'') created by the supreme being [[Roog]] (or [[Koox]] among the [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]).&lt;ref name="Gen"&gt;Genesis of YAAB &amp; YOP » narrated by « Armand Diouf » of Ndimaag ([[Senegal]]), [in] Gravrand, Henry, "La Civilisation Sereer - Pangool", vol. 2. Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990), p 204, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative went on to state that, the original twins (female and male respectively) were carried from the [[Empyrean|Empyrean Heaven]] by an ark.&lt;ref name="Grav"/&gt; This is believed to be deposited in the sacred village of Yaboyabo.&lt;ref name="Grav"/&gt; Although the ark of Yaabo-Yabo is an ancient [[relic]]&lt;ref name="Gav 2"/&gt; under the guardianship of this Serer village, and ritually venerated by those who adhere to the tenets of [[Serer religion]],&lt;ref name="Gav 2"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp 208-9&lt;/ref&gt; it is highly unlikely to be the original "ark" and was probably an ancient replica. Many Serer homes have ancient artifacts, some of which are religious in nature (see [[Serer ancient history]]).&lt;ref name="Gav 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Becker, Charles, "Vestiges historiques, témoins matériels du passé dans les pays sereer", CNRS-ORSTOM, Dakar, 1993, [http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/b_fdi_01/010014636.pdf] (Retrieved : 25 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
