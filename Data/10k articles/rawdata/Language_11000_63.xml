      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6020">An '''accident''', in [[philosophy]], is an attribute that may or may not belong to a subject, without affecting its essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=William Keith Chambers|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|pages=148|isbn=978-0-521-38760-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Aristotle]] made a distinction between the [[essential properties|essential]] and accidental [[property (philosophy)|properties]] of a thing. [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other [[Catholic]] theologians have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the [[theology]] of the [[Eucharist]], particularly the [[transubstantiation]] of bread and wine into body and blood. In this example, the bread and wine are considered accidents, since at transubstantiation, they become incidental to the essential substance of body and blood. 

In modern [[philosophy]], an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts:  property and [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]. [[Non-essentialism]] argues that every property is an accident. Modal [[necessitarianism]] argues that all properties are essential and no property is an accident.

==Aristotle ==
{{see also|Potentiality and actuality}}
[[Aristotle]] made a distinction between the [[essential properties|essential]] and accidental [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of a thing. For example, a chair can be made of wood or metal, but this is accidental to its being a chair: that is, it is still a chair regardless of the material from which it is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|others=Richard J. Blackwell, Richard J. Spath, W. Edmund Thirlkel|title=Commentary on Aristotle's Physics|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2003|pages=29|isbn=978-1-84371-545-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CD0IRPg4roC&amp;pg=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To put this in technical terms, an accident is a property which has no necessary connection to the [[essence]] of the thing being described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/aristotle/section6.rhtml|title=Aristotle - Metaphysics: Books Zeta and Eta|publisher=SparkNotes|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081218210927/http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/aristotle/section6.rhtml| archivedate= 18 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-noncontradiction/|title=Aristotle on Non-contradiction|date=2007-02-02|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Preus|first=Anthony |author2=John P. Anton|author3=George L. Kustas|title=Essays in Ancient Greek Philosophy V|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-7914-1027-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To take another example, all bachelors are unmarried: this is a necessary or essential property of what it means to be a bachelor. A particular bachelor may have brown hair, but this would be a property particular to that individual, and with respect to his bachelorhood it would be an accidental property. And this distinction is independent of experimental verification: even if for some reason all the unmarried men with non-brown hair were killed, and every single existent bachelor had brown hair, the property of having brown hair would still be accidental, since it would still be logically possible for a bachelor to have hair of another color.

The nine kinds of accidents according to Aristotle are quantity, quality, relation, habitus, time, location, situation (or position), action, and passion ("being acted on"). Together with "substance", these nine kinds of accidents constitute the ten fundamental [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] of Aristotle's [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/433/catlec.htm|title=Predication and Ontology: The Categories|publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholic church|Catholic]] theologians such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the [[theology]] of the [[Eucharist#Roman Catholic|Eucharist]], particularly the [[transubstantiation]] of bread and wine into body and blood. According to this tradition, the accidents (or ''species'') of the appearance of bread and wine do not change, but the substance changes from bread and wine to the [[Eucharist|Body and Blood of Christ]].

== Modern philosophy ==
In modern [[philosophy]], an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts: [[Property (philosophy)|property]] and [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]. In relation to the first, an accidental property (Greek ''symbebekos'')&lt;ref name="Slomkowski"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slomkowski|first=Paul|title=Aristotle's Topics|publisher=BRILL|year=1997|pages=90–93|isbn=978-90-04-10757-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; is at its most basic level a ''property''. The color "[[yellow]]", "high value", "Atomic Number 79" are all properties, and are therefore candidates for being accidental. On the other hand, "[[gold]]", "[[platinum]]", and "[[electrum]]" are not properties, and are therefore not classified as accidents.

There are two opposed philosophical positions that also impact the meaning of this term:
*[[Non-essentialism|Anti-essentialism]] (associated with [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]) argues that there are no essential properties at all, and therefore every property is an accident.
*Modal [[necessitarianism]] (associated with [[Saul Kripke]]), argues for the veracity of the modal system "Triv" (If P is true, then P must be true). The consequence of this theory is that all properties are essential (and no property is an accident).

'''Adélia Luzia Prado Freitas''' (born 13 December 1935) is a Brazilian writer and poet.

== Life ==
She was born in [[Divinópolis]], [[Minas Gerais]] (one of the interior states of Brazil), where she still lives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/poetrycenter/wp/adelia-prado/|title=Adélia  Prado — The Poetry Center at Smith College|website=www.smith.edu|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07ff1n1|title=Adelia Prado: Voice of Brazil - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended college at the [[University of Divinópolis]], earning degrees in Philosophy and Religious Education.  She taught school until 1979, and was the Cultural Liaison for the City of Divinópolis from 1983 to 1988.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/awards-and-poets/lifetime-recognition-award/2014-adelia-prado/|title=Griffin Poetry Prize {{!}} 2014 – Adelia Prado|website=Griffin Poetry Prize|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary career ==
Her poetry was "discovered" in 1976, when at the age of 40 she sent a small collection of her poems to poet [[Affonso Romano de Sant'Anna|Affonso Romano de Sant’Anna]].  De Sant'Anna passed her work on to the Brazilian modernist poet [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]], who read it and proclaimed in his weekly newspaper column&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that St. Francis was dictating lines to a housewife in Minas Gerais.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/the-mystical-rose-271|title=The Mystical Rose {{!}} Bloodaxe Books|website=www.bloodaxebooks.com|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is a seeming paradox of a deep and spiritual Catholicism combined with the physical and the carnal.  She herself has tried to resolve this contradiction, writing that "It's the soul that's erotic."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  She is especially focused on the everyday concerns of women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Adélia has published eight volumes of poetry and seven volumes of prose, starting with her first poetry collection ''Bagegem'' (Baggage).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In describing her work, [[Robert Hass]] said "Brazil has produced what might seem impossible: a really sexy, mystical, Catholic poet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.recoveringwords.com/site/happy-surprise-recovering-words-favorite-honoured-at-2014-griffin-poetry-awards|title=Happy Surprise! Recovering Words’ Favorite Honoured at 2014 Griffin Poetry Awards|date=2014-06-11|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though she does her best to avoid the limelight, Prado is considered one of Brazil's foremost poets.  Her work has been translated into English, Italian, and Spanish, and has been written about extensively in the critical and popular press in Brazil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Adélia Prado has a long relationship with American poet and translator [[Ellen Doré Watson]], who has translated several collections of Prado's poetry.  They are:
* ''The Alphabet in the Park: Selected Poems of Adélia Prado'' ([[Wesleyan University Press]], 1990)
* ''Ex-Voto: Poems of Adélia Prado'' ([[Tupelo Press]], 2013)
* ''The Mystical Rose: Selected Poems'' ([[Bloodaxe Books]], 2014)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Prado's work has also been published in translation in ''[[The Paris Review]]'', ''[[Antaeus (magazine)|Antaeus]]'', ''Field'', and ''[[The American Poetry Review|American Poetry Review]]''.  It has been included in ''The Ecco Anthology of International Poetry'' and ''The Farrar Straus Giroux Book of Twentieth Century Latin American Poetry''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Awards and Recognitions ==
The Brazilian National Library's ''Jornal de Poesia'' (Poetry Journal) polled intellectuals in 1998 to compile ''A Lisa Dos 20'' (the "List of Twenty") foremost living poets. Prado was ranked fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jornaldepoesia.jor.br/vinte.html|title=Jornal de Poesia - Disseram|last=SF|website=www.jornaldepoesia.jor.br|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Adélia was featured in the prestigious Brazilian "Cadernos de Literature Brasileira" produced by the Instituto Moreira Salles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.casasbahia.com.br/livros/LinguisticaOratoria/TeoriaLiteraria/Cadernos-de-Literatura-Brasileira-Adelia-Prado-Volume-09-221338.html|title=Livro - Cadernos de Literatura Brasileira: Adélia Prado - Volume 09 - Teoria Literária no CasasBahia.com.br|last=CasasBahia.com.br|website=www.casasbahia.com.br|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prado was a featured reader at FLIP (Paraty International Literary Festival) in 2006, an event that drew large interest to her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/category/ad-lia-prado|title=Adélia Prado {{!}} Bloodaxe Books|website=www.bloodaxebooks.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, she received the Griffin Lifetime Recognition Award, presented by the trustees of the [[Griffin Poetry Prize]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3227">'''Alphius Avitus''' was a Latin poet believed to have flourished during the reigns of the Roman emperors [[Augustus]] and [[Tiberius]], that is, the late 1st century BC or early 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Ramsay | first = William | authorlink = William Ramsay (classical scholar) | title = Avitus, Alphius | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 534–535 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0443.html | date =  | accessdate = 2009-04-11 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103939/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0443.html | archivedate = 2011-05-14 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many suppose him to be the same person with [[Alfius Flavus]]—the precocious pupil of [[Lucius Cestius Pius]] and contemporary with [[Seneca the Elder]], who while only a boy was so renowned for his eloquence that crowds flocked to listen to his orations&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Elder]], ''Controversiae'' i.&lt;/ref&gt;—and with a "Flavius Alfius", who is referred to by [[Pliny the Elder]] as an authority for a story about dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' ix. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led some scholars to conjecture that this person's full, correct name may have been "Flavus Alfius Avitus".  All this is very uncertain.  We know from the ancient grammarian [[Terentianus]] that Alphius Avitus composed a work about "Illustrious Men", in [[iambic dimeter]]s, extending to several books;&lt;ref&gt;[[Terentianus]], 1. 2448&lt;/ref&gt; and eight lines are cited by [[Priscian]] from the second book, forming a part of the legend of the [[Falisci|Faliscan]] schoolteacher who betrayed his students to [[Marcus Furius Camillus]]; besides which, three lines more from the first book are contained in some manuscripts of the same grammarian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Priscian]], vol. i. pp. 410, 553, vol. ii. p. 131, ed. Krehl, or pp. 823, 947, 1136, ed. Putsch.&lt;/ref&gt;  These fragments are given in the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' of [[Pieter Burman the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pieter Burman the Younger]], ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' ii. p. 267, and Add. ii. p. 730, or Ep. n. 125, ed. Meyer&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an "Alpheus Philologus," from whom [[Priscian]] adduces five words,&lt;ref&gt;[[Priscian]], vol. i. p. 370, ed. Krehl, or p. 792, ed. Putsch&lt;/ref&gt; and an "Alfius" whose work on the [[Trojan War]] is mentioned by [[Festus (historian)|Festus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Festus (historian)|Festus]], ''[[sub verbo|s.v.]]'' Mamertini&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wernsdorf, Poett.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1904">[[File:Archeo-komissiya.JPG|thumb|The Proceedings of the Russian Archival Commission from 1914]]
The '''Archaeographic Commission''' (Археографическая комиссия) was set up in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1834 by [[Platon Shirinsky-Shikhmatov]], [[Nikolay Gerasimovich Ustryalov|Nikolay Ustryalov]], and [[Pavel Stroyev]] with the aim of publishing historical and ethnographic materials assembled by Stroyev and others in the provinces of [[Imperial Russia]]. 

The commission was affiliated with the imperial ministry of education and was modeled on an earlier commission based in [[Moscow]]. Its first major enterprise was the [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles]], published from 1841 onward. Regional archaeographical commissions were established in [[Kiev]], [[Museum of Antiquities in Vilnius#Archaeological and Archaeographic Commissions|Vilna]], and [[Tiflis]]. The commission spearheaded efforts to obtain foreign sources on Russian history and sent its emissaries in search of Russia-related documents to the major archives of Europe.

After Shirinsky-Shikhmatov the commission's presidents included [[Avraam Norov]] (1850-69), [[Vladimir Pavlovich Titov|Vladimir Titov]] (1871-91), [[Sergei Platonov]] (1918-29), [[Nikolay Likhachov]] (1929), and [[Mikhail Pokrovsky]] (1930-32).

In the 20th century the institution went through several reorganizations and name changes (it was known as the ''Historical-Archaeographic Institute'' and the ''Historical-Archaeographic Commission of the Soviet Academy of Sciences''). The modern archaeographic commission was founded in 1956 by [[Mikhail Tikhomirov]] as a branch of the Academy's history department.

In the American legal system, '''argumentative''' is an [[evidence (law)|evidentiary]] [[Objection (law)|objection]] raised in response to a question which prompts a [[witness]] to draw [[inference]]s from facts of the case.&lt;ref&gt;"An  attorney shall not ask  argumentative  questions, i.e. one that asks the witness to agree to a conclusion drawn by the questioner without eliciting testimony as to new facts. The court, however, in its discretion, may allow limited use of argumentative questions on [[cross examination|cross exam]]." Minnesota State Bar, "[https://www.mnbar.org/docs/default-source/mock-trial-forms/mock-trial-objections.pdf?sfvrsn=0 Mock Trial Objections]", accessed 22 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

One common misconception is that argumentative questions are meant only to cause a witness to argue with the examiner. This error rests on misunderstanding the word "argument". ''Argument'' can mean "[[Argument|a series of persuasive statements]]" (the legal sense discussed in this article) as well as "a verbal fight or disagreement". Thus, an argumentative objection may be raised only when the lawyer himself is making a legal argument under the guise of asking a question. "Badgering the witness" is the proper objection for a lawyer who is antagonizing or mocking a witness by asking insulting or derisive questions, perhaps in an attempt to provoke an emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;"Badgering the Witness: 
An attorney may not harass or continue to annoy/aggravate a witness." Minnesota State Bar, "[https://www.mnbar.org/docs/default-source/mock-trial-forms/mock-trial-objections.pdf?sfvrsn=0 Mock Trial Objections]", accessed 22 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
A lawyer on direct examination asks his witness, a layperson with no legal training, "So John Doe was driving negligently?" Opposing counsel could raise an argumentative objection. In this context, "negligently" is a legal [[term of art]] with a precise and narrow meaning, and the witness cannot reasonably answer the question without understanding the relevant law. Since the lawyer is "arguing" his case that John Doe was driving negligently through the witness, the objection would be sustained and the improper statements stricken from the record.

In this example, however, the lawyer conducting the direct examination may have an opportunity to rephrase his question. If the judge sustains the argumentative objection, the lawyer may instead ask questions such as "was John Doe exceeding the posted speed limit?", "was John Doe making lane changes without proper signals?", "how did Mr. Doe respond to your comments about his driving," or "Did you feel unsafe when you were a passenger in the car driven by John Doe?"

Such questions may be permitted and require no legal expertise for a layperson to answer, thus allowing the lawyer to introduce testimony about John Doe's driving habits without specifically using the legal term ''[[negligence]]''.

[[Image:Jazz standard bridge.png|thumb|right|350px|The [[ragtime progression]] (E7-A7-D7-G7) often appears in the bridge of [[jazz standard]]s ({{audio|Jazz standard bridge.mid|Play}}).&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Bill (1997). ''Jazz Chord Progressions'', p.56. {{ISBN|0-7935-7038-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The III7-VI7-II7-V7 (or V7/V/V/V - V7/V/V - V7/V - V7) [[circle progression]] leads back to C major (I) but is itself indefinite in key.]]
In [[music]], especially western [[popular music]], a '''bridge''' is a contrasting [[section (music)|section]] that prepares for the return of the original material section. In a piece in which the original material or melody is referred to as the "A" section, the bridge may be the third eight-[[bar (music)|bar]] [[phrase (music)|phrase]] in a [[thirty-two-bar form]] (the B in AABA), or may be used more loosely in [[verse-chorus form]], or, in a [[compound AABA form]], used as a contrast to a full AABA section.

The term comes from a German word for bridge, ''Steg'', used by the [[Meistersinger]]s of the 15th to the 18th century to describe a [[transition (music)|transitional]] section in medieval [[bar form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horst|first=Brunner|title=Bar Form|journal=New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German term became widely known in 1920s Germany through musicologist [[Alfred Lorenz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorenz|first=Alfred|title=Das Geheimnis der Form bei Richard Wagner|year=1924|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his exhaustive studies of [[Richard Wagner]]'s adaptations of bar form in his popular 19th-century neo-medieval operas. The term entered the English lexicon in the 1930s—translated as ''bridge''—via composers fleeing Nazi Germany who, working in Hollywood and on Broadway, used the term to describe similar transitional sections in the American popular music they were writing.

{{expand section|elaborations on the difference between a bridge and a pre-chorus. Are there contemporary examples contrasting the two?|date=March 2011}}

The bridge is often used to contrast with and prepare for the return of the [[Song structure (popular music)#Verse|verse]] and the [[refrain|chorus]]. "The b section of the popular song chorus is often called the ''bridge'' or ''release''."&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.318. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}. Emphasis original.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the B of AABA in thirty-two-bar form, with the verse surrounding the whole. While the bridge in verse-chorus and other forms is C, for example: ABABCAB. Lyrically, the bridge is typically used to pause and reflect on the earlier portions of the song or to prepare the listener for the climax. The term may also refer to the section between the verse and the chorus, though this is more commonly called the ''[[pre-Chorus|pre-chorus]]'' or ''link''. The lyrics of the theme, "[[The Song That Goes Like This]]", from the musical play ''[[Spamalot]]'' spoofs the abuse of the bridge in romantic songwriting: "Now we can go straight / into the middle eight / a bridge that is too far for me".{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Similarly, in the ''[[Axis of Awesome]]'' song "This Is How You Write a Love Song", the lyrics humorously map the movement of the song from chorus to chorus using bridges.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} In the song "[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine]]", [[James Brown]] asks if he can "take the band to the bridge". [[Led Zeppelin]] makes an [[in-joke]] regarding the use of bridges in popular music in their song "[[The Crunge]]", asking, at the end, "Where's the confounded bridge?" The song, humorously, does not have a bridge.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Classical music ==
[[File:MusikSequenz.png|thumbnail|right|400px|A bridge in J.S. Bach's Fugue in G major BWV 860, mm. 17-19.{{audio|MusikSequenz.mid|Play}}]]

Bridges are also common in [[European classical music|classical music]], and are known as a specific [[Sequence (music)|Sequence]] form—also known as transitions. Formally called a '''bridge-passage''', they delineate separate sections of an extended work, or smooth what would otherwise be an abrupt modulation, such as the transition between the two [[Theme (music)|themes]] of a [[sonata form]]. In the latter context, this transition between two musical [[Subject (music)|subjects]] is often referred to as the "transition theme";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songstuff.com/glossary/ Songstuff Music Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, in later [[Romantic music|Romantic]] symphonies such as [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|New World Symphony]] or [[César Franck]]'s [[Symphony in D minor (Franck)|Symphony in D minor]], the transition theme becomes almost a third subject in itself.&lt;ref&gt;Collins Music Encyclopedia, London 1959, article "Symphony"&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter work also provides several good examples of a short bridge to smooth a [[Modulation (music)|modulation]].  Instead of simply repeating the whole [[sonata form#Exposition|exposition]] in the original key, as would be done in a symphony of the [[Classical period (music)|classical period]], Franck repeats the first subject a minor third higher in F minor.  A two-bar bridge achieves this transition with Frank's characteristic combination of [[Modulation (music)#Enharmonic modulation|enharmonic]] and [[Modulation (music)#Chromatic modulation|chromatic modulation]].  After the repeat of the first subject, another bridge of four bars leads into the transition theme in F major, the key of the true second subject. 

In a [[fugue]], a bridge is, "...a short passage at the end of the first entrance of the answer and the beginning of the second entrance of the subject. Its purpose is to modulate back to the tonic key (subject) from the answer (which is in the dominant key). Not all fugues include a bridge."&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2009). ''Music in Theory and Practice: Volume II'', p.51. Eighth Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-310188-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a bridge-passage that separates two sections of a more loosely organized work occurs in [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[An American in Paris]]''.  As [[Deems Taylor]] described it in the program notes for the first performance: "Having safely eluded the taxis ... the American's itinerary becomes somewhat obscured. ... However, since what immediately ensues is technically known as a bridge-passage, one is reasonably justified in assuming that the Gershwin pen ... has perpetrated a musical pun and that ... our American has crossed the Seine, and is somewhere on the Left Bank."&lt;ref&gt;[[An American in Paris]] &amp; "''george gershwin's an american in paris piano solo''" [sic], Warner Bros. Publications Inc., 1929 (renewed), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brigasc''' is a [[dialect]] of the [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian language]]. It is spoken in [[Italy]] and [[France]].

==Area of use==

The Brigasc dialect is spoken in [[La Brigue]] (France) and [[Briga Alta]] (Italy) and some villages of the communes of [[Ormea]] and [[Triora]]. It is very close to [[Royasc]] dialect.

==History==
During the [[Renaissance]] the [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian language]] was spoken in all the territories of the [[Republic of Genoa]]: in the western area of this republic one of its groups (spoken mainly in the area between the [[Principality of Monaco]] and [[Sanremo]]) was called ''Intemelio''.

The language spoken in the mountains around [[La Brigue|Briga]] was called ''Brigasc'' and received some influence from the Occitan language.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Forner, "À propos du Ligurien Intémélien.

'''Burelage''' ({{lang-fr|burelage}}),&lt;ref&gt;"Burelage" and "burelé" are used to describe the 50 francs ''View of Paris'' stamp in [[Dallay]] catalogue, 2007-2008, page 183.&lt;/ref&gt; also '''burelé''', is a French term referring to an intricate network of fine lines, dots or other designs printed over or as the background of some [[postage stamp|postage]] or [[revenue stamp]]s to prevent [[Philatelic fakes and forgeries|counterfeiting]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Scott Carleton, ''The International Encyclopædic Dictionary of Philately,'' Iola, Wisconsin (1997), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.N. Williams, ''Fundamentals of Philately,'' State College, Pennsylvania (1990), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In English the word is sometimes spelled with an accent on the first "e" as '''burélage''', although the accent does not appear in the French spelling and its origin is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Talk:Burelage]].&lt;/ref&gt; Burelage most commonly appears as a form of [[underprint]]ing.

Early uses of burelage on postage stamps include the first issue of the stamps of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Denmark|Denmark]] from 1851,&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Catalogue]], Denmark, nos. 1-2 and note.&lt;/ref&gt; and stamps issued by the [[Hanover|City of Hanover]] beginning in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Catalogue, German States, Hanover, no. 8 and note.&lt;/ref&gt; Stamp varieties may be distinguished in catalogs based on the presence or absence of burelage as well as variations in the burelage itself, such as the size of network,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Catalogue, German States, Hanover, nos. 8-14, referencing fine versus large network.&lt;/ref&gt; orientation on the stamp,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Catalogue, Mexico, nos. 1109-1138, distinguishing between two types of burelage based on whether they run lower left to upper right or vice versa&lt;/ref&gt; color,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Catalogue, Denmark, nos. 1-2 (original burelage in yellow brown; later reprints in brown).&lt;/ref&gt; or method of printing.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Catalogue, Denmark, nos. 1-2 note (first printing from copper plate [recess printed]; later printing typographed).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although burelage is usually unobtrusive, some of the [[Postage stamps and postal history of Mexico#Exporta series|Mexico Exporta stamps]] (see below) had burelage printed over the stamp which is dark enough to obscure the stamp image.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2349">'''Chamber opera''' is a designation for [[opera]]s written to be performed with a [[Chamber music|chamber ensemble]] rather than a full [[orchestra]]. Early 20th century operas of this type include [[Paul Hindemith]]'s ''[[Cardillac]]'' (1926). Earlier small-scale operas such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]]'s ''[[La serva padrona]]'' (1733) are sometimes known as chamber operas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://0-www.oxfordmusiconline.com.catalogue.libraries.london.ac.uk/subscriber/article/grove/music/05380 "Chamber Opera"] in ''[[Oxford Music Online]]'', accessed 19 December 2016. {{Subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other 20th century examples include   [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[Savitri (opera)|Savitri]]'' (1916). [[Benjamin Britten]] wrote works in this category in the 1940s when the [[English Opera Group]] needed works that could easily be taken on tour and performed in a variety of small performance spaces. ''[[The Rape of Lucretia]]'' (1946) was his first example in the genre, and Britten followed it with ''[[Albert Herring]]'' (1947), ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]'' (1954) and ''[[Curlew River]]'' (1964). Other composers, including [[Hans Werner Henze]], [[Harrison Birtwistle]], [[Thomas Adès]], [[George Benjamin (composer)|George Benjamin]], [[William Walton]], and [[Philip Glass]] have written in this genre.

Instrumentation for chamber operas vary: Britten scored ''The Rape of Lucretia'' for eight singers with single strings and wind with piano, harp and percussion. [[Humphrey Searle]]'s ''[[The Diary of a Madman (opera)|The Diary of a Madman]]'' (1958) is scored for four voices and an orchestra of single [[stringed instrument|strings]], [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]] and [[brass instrument|brass]], with two [[percussion instrument|percussionists]]. An [[magnetic tape|electronic tape]] is also specified to produce particular [[sound effect]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1958), p. (iii).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Weir]]'s ''[[King Harald's Saga]]'' (1979) is for a single soprano voice.

{{other uses}}
'''Chirography''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] derived (''cheir-'/'cheiro-'') Latin ''chiro-'' (similar to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] word ''kesar'') meaning hand (i.e. ''chiropractic'')) is the study of [[penmanship]] and [[handwriting]] in all of its aspects.

==History==
According to [[Georges Jean]] (1992, p.&amp;nbsp;12), standardised writing 'cannot be said to exist until there is an agreed upon repertoire of formal signs or symbols that can be used to reproduce clearly the thoughts and feelings' that those utilising them hope to put forth.

===Ancient writing===
Although writing's origins may be traced back to the renowned French cave paintings in [[Lascaux]] (said to be about 20,000 years old{{By whom|date=July 2013}}), it appears to have been nearly 17 millennia before any formal system of writing was developed.

The [[Sumer|Sumerians]] are regarded as the first everyday users (in agricultural applications) of [[pictographs ]](of which scholars{{Who|date=July 2013}} have catalogued some 15,000 individual symbols).

===Contextual handwriting/cuneiform===
Contextual handwriting is said to have begun with the development of Cuneiform (from the Latin Cuneus and referring to the [[stylus]]es used in creating the pictographs of the aforesaid). [[Cuneiform]] would be applied in the recording of the [[Akkadian language]] and several other languages of [[Mesopotamia]] as the usage of Sumerian began to fade as a spoken language.

===Convergence in Mesopotamia and Egypt===
As both Mesopotamians and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] began to regard writing as an indicator of one's privilege/rank in societal hierarchy, instructors of the times were given rein to develop drilling (reading/identification, and so on) and memorisation techniques still in operation in modern language instruction. This may have also been assisted by the eventual availability of [[papyrus]] as well as the evolution of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] into the more comprehensible forms of [[Hieratic]] (from the Greek 'hieros' meaning 'sacred' and coined by [[Herodotus]] (c. 484-424 BCE)) and [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]]. These would diminish one another in their own swiftness and would be key elements in the deciphering of the [[Rosetta Stone]] by [[Jean-François Champollion]].

===Initial alphabets===
While it is thought that the [[Phoenician alphabet]] is the first veritable [[alphabet]], it contained only consonants (an [[abjad]]). Upon reaching the shores of Greece via sailing merchants, it is proposed that the Greek alphabet was developed by a combination of the Phoenician form and the Egyptian Demotic. Although it would fall out of common usage in or around 1100 BCE (except for, or almost exclusively in the university/scholarly realm, as well as in its mother country), its presence would be felt in more modern languages such as Latin and later English.

===Aramaic and the worth of Biblical texts===
As a great number of Biblical texts were transcribed in [[Aramaic]] (arising in [[Aram Damascus|Aram]] (modern day [[Syria]]) in or near 800 BCE), along with the rising popularity of the Gospels, teachings of both the language and theological aspects therein became more prevalent in society. This would be furthered by the eventual translations of the Aramaic into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and/or [[Yiddish]] which began to flourish in the Arabic peninsula and the surrounding areas along with the established language found in Qur'anic texts. And although there are spotty connections with their Phoenician systems, it is clear that the transcription of the 'scriptures' mentioned into dialects still spoken, to some degree, today allowed for written as well as verbal language to reach a larger portion of the masses.

===Chinese language/East-Asian calligraphy/handwriting===
The intricate system of characters defined by their [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] (214 in the [[China|Chinese]] system, with an alternative 79 radical system in the later developed [[Japan]]ese interpretation known as [[Kanji]] (漢字)) is believed to have come to use around 2000 BCE. It was furthermore codified about 1500 BCE and finally systemised between 200 BCE-400 CE. It is considered one of the most consistently unchanged systems of writing and is held in high regard in its influence of nearby languages. Its forms, when written, may range from bloc (the most visible form generally not using brushes) to semi- and fully cursive styles which require a certain degree of skill and devotion (through constant practice and memorisation) and remain in wide use.

===English/European development of script===
In the words of [[Philip Hofer]] (1941, p.&amp;nbsp;2), in the latter portion of the 7th century '[[England|English]] calligraphy became important and influential on the course of writing styles for the first time' (often credited in part to [[Alcuin]] of York). Eventually a form of English handwriting would form to follow the function of the daily business affairs of merchants, clerks and professional [[scribes]] for a more masterful and consistent means of correspondence. 

During the same period (around the 17th-18th centuries), as English trade came more to the forefront of mainland Europe and the ''[[New World]]'', a significant amount of [[copy books]] came about which made use of the finery of English script of the time. In some time a more common system of [[wikt:join|join]]ed/[[cursive]] handwriting would be developed for usage in the same vein along with its promotion in the education system.

===Some key figures of chirography===
*[[Herodotus]]
*[[Qin Shi Huang]](秦始皇)(260-210 BCE)
*[[Alcuin]] (735-804 CE)
*[[Johann Gutenberg]] (1398-1468 CE)
*[[Ludovico Arrighi]][http://www.infoamerica.org/museo/tipografos/paginas/arrighi.htm] (1475-1527 CE)
*[[Samuel Pepys]] (1633-1703 CE)
*[[Jean-François Champollion]] (1790-1832 CE)

==Modern chirography==
Although, to a certain degree, modern widespread and efficient means of printing coupled with computer technology have pushed stylistic and complex handwriting techniques to the backdrop of linguistic aspects, the aforementioned practices remain in use often in the fields of academia for study. Calligraphy remains a commonplace facet of many modern East Asian languages as well as forms of cursive Arabic. However dated they may seem, they are necessary in order to grasp archaic or other older forms of current languages in the field of [[linguistics]], as there are still mysteries to resolve (such as the near indecipherable [[Indus Script]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3333">An '''encumbrance''' is a [[right]] to, interest in, or legal [[Legal liability|liability]] on [[real property]] that does not prohibit passing [[Title (property)|title]] to the property but that may diminish its value.&lt;ref&gt;Steven H. Gifis, ''Barron's Dictionary of Legal Terms'', 4th edn., s.v. "encumbrance" (Barron's Educational Series, 2008), 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Encumbrances can be classified in several ways. They may be financial (for example, [[lien]]s) or non-financial (for example, [[easement]]s, private restrictions). Alternatively, they may be divided into those that affect title (for example, lien, legal or equitable charge) or those that affect the use or physical condition of the encumbered property (for example, restrictions, easements, encroachments).&lt;ref&gt;Fillmore E. Galay et al., ''[[Modern Real]] Estate Practice in Illinois'', 4th edn. (Chicago: Dearborn Real Estate Education, 2001), 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Encumbrances include [[security interest]]s, liens, [[servitude in civil law|servitudes]] (for example, easements, [[English land law#Wayleaves|wayleave]]s, [[real covenant]]s, [[profit (real estate)|profits a prendre]]), [[leasing|leases]], restrictions, encroachments, and air and subsurface rights. Also, those considered as potentially making the title defeasible are encumbrances, for example, [[charging order]]s, [[building order]]s and [[structure]] alteration. Encumbrance: charge upon or claim against land arising out of private grant or a contract.

==Jurisdictions==

===Hong Kong===
In [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], there is statutory definition of "encumbrance". In Conveyancing and Property Ordinance (Cap. 219) it reads: "''"encumbrance" (產權負擔) includes a legal and equitable mortgage, a trust for securing money, a lien, a charge of a portion, annuity, or other capital or annual sum; and "encumbrancer" (產權負擔人) has a meaning corresponding with that of "encumbrance" and includes every person entitled to the benefit of an encumbrance, or to require payment and discharge thereof''".

==Other uses==

===Colleges===
It is also a term used by [[college]]s and universities to describe limitations placed on a [[student]]'s account due to late payment, late registration, or other reasons stated by the institution. An encumbrance can prohibit students from registering for [[Class (education)|classes]], affect the release of their transcripts, or delay the reception of their [[diploma]]s.

===Accounting===
In [[management accounting]], ''encumbrance'' is a management tool used to reflect commitments in the accounting system and attempt to prevent overspending. Encumbrances allow organizations to recognize future commitments of resources prior to an actual [[expenditure]]. 
;Pre-encumbrance: Amount expected to spend, but for which there is no legal obligation to spend. A requisition is a typical pre-encumbrance transaction.
;Encumbrance: Amount for which there is a legal obligation to spend in the future. A purchase order is a typical encumbrance transaction.
;Expenditure: Amount for which there has been an expenditure of funds. An expenditure is recorded in Commitment Control for both vouchers payable and journal entries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">'''Event covers''' are a type of stamp [[cover (philately)|covers]] (decorated, stamped and canceled commemorative [[envelopes]]) that are created to celebrate an event or note an [[anniversary]].

The design (called a "[[cachet]]") is generally placed on the left side of the envelope (although there are also "all over" cachets). It explains what is being commemorated on what date, and generally also includes an illustration page.

Ideally, the stamps used relate to the celebration (for instance, space stamps for a shuttle launch). Cancels are either obtained in the city of the event (such as [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]] for the [[Wright Brothers]] first flight anniversary) or, for larger quantities of envelopes, from a special cancellation unit maintained by the Postal Service in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. If a special cancellation (one with a design) has been created for the event, you can generally only receive that cancel from the local post office.

[[Image:DC3-Isle-of-Man-Event-Cover.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Isle of Man Special Event Cover]]
A good example of a special Event cover was one by the [[Isle of Man Post|Isle of Man Philatelic Bureau]] that was issued in 1985 to mark the anniversary of the aircraft Douglas [[DC-3]], which was of interest, not only because of the high volume of air mail handled by Dakotas at that time, but also the link between the names of Douglas, Isle of Man, and Dakota - Douglas DC3.&lt;ref&gt;Special Dakota - [[Grimsby Telegraph|Evening Telegraph]] - 5 December 1985&lt;/ref&gt; A 26p stamp was specially issued by the Isle of Man and a special handstamp was also created for these covers,&lt;ref name=LS-13-12-1985 &gt;Top-flight honour for schoolboy - Front Page - Lincolnshire Standard - 13 December 1985&lt;/ref&gt; which was deliberately created with a Dakota flying "free" and not boxed in.&lt;ref&gt;Special Dakota Cover Inside Information Card - [[Isle of Man Post|Isle of Man Philatelic Bureau]] - 17 December 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The envelope was also officially acknowledged by the [[McDonnell Douglas]] company and bore their official DC3 logo in the bottom right of the Envelope.

The earliest recognized event covers were [[Inauguration Day|presidential inauguration]] covers, which were first created in the early part of the 20th century (the stamp hobby calls envelopes "covers" because letters were originally simply wrapped in a blank piece of paper, or "cover"). Event cover creation and collecting is considered part of the first day cover hobby, which creates decorated covers to commemorate the issuance of stamps. Both fields are recognized by the principal cover collecting organization, the [http://www.afdcs.org/ American First Day Cover Society], which includes an event cover category in its annual cachet-maker's contest and an event cover column in its journal, ''First Days''.

Event covers can include mail that was aboard aircraft that flew the mail between two points, usually large cities, for the first time, however these covers are usually referred to as [[First flight cover]]s by collectors.

A '''fluffer''' is a person employed to keep a male [[pornography|porn performer]]'s penis erect on the set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/fluffer "Definition of 'fluffer'"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''. Retrieved May 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; These duties, which do not necessarily involve touching the actors, are considered part of the makeup department. After setting up the desired angle, the director asks the actors to hold position and calls for the fluffer to "fluff" the actors for the shot. Fluffing could also entail sexual acts such as [[fellatio]] or [[non-penetrative sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nerve.com/content/a-lifes-work-this-job-sucks |title=A Life's Work: This Job Sucks |first=Grant |last=Stoddard |date=2 September 2002 |work=[[Nerve (website)|Nerve]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220155146/http://www.nerve.com/content/a-lifes-work-this-job-sucks |archivedate=20 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic career has included work in [[Oriental languages]], [[linguistics]] and [[computing]], with side interests in [[philosophy]], and political and [[economics|economic]] thought. He lectured at the [[London School of Economics]], the [[University of Lancaster]] and the [[University of Leeds]] before moving to Sussex in 1991.&lt;ref name=Sampson /&gt;

Sampson is widely known for academic papers criticising the [[psychological nativism|linguistic nativist]] movement, including the arguments of proponents such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Steven Pinker]]. Sampson critically engaged with Pinker's 1994 book ''[[The Language Instinct]]'', in his own book ''[[The 'Language Instinct' Debate]]'', the first edition of which, published in 1997, was entitled ''Educating Eve''. To date, Pinker has not published responses to the criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grsampson.net/REmpNat.html Geoffrey Sampson: Empiricism v.

Sampson describes himself as a politically active man. He was elected to [[Wealden District|Wealden]] District Council in 2001, serving until 2002 with the local [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] branch. He resigned this position after he was criticized by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] ministers and councillors for publishing on his website an article, ''There's Nothing Wrong With Racism (Except the Name)'', containing a number of racist claims. The outcome was subsequently endorsed by [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|Conservative Central Office]] as "in the best interests of all concerned ...the Conservative party is opposed to all forms of racial discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/race/story/0,,715354,00.html Tory councillor forced to step down after racism row], Staff and agencies, ''The Guardian'', May 14, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Some time later he left the Conservative Party and in 2006 joined the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grsampson.net/Life.html Life], official website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hezhou''' (Chinese 河州话 ''Hézhōuhuà'') is a creolized [[mixed language]] spoken in [[Gansu Province]], China. It has been the lingua franca of [[Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture|Linxia]] (formerly Hezhou) for several centuries. It is based on Uyghur and perhaps [[Salar language|Salar]]. It has been [[relexified]] by Mandarin Chinese, so that nearly all roots are of Chinese origin, but grammatically it remains a Turkic language, with six [[noun case]]s, [[agglutinative]] morphology and an [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] word order. Grammatical suffixes are either Turkic or Chinese in origin; in the latter case they have been divorced from their original function and bear little to no relation to Chinese semantics. The phonology is largely Chinese, with three tones, though Hezhou [[tone sandhi]] is unusual from a Chinese perspective.&lt;ref name=Mei/&gt; It may be that Hezhou tone differs between ethnic Chinese, [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Dongxiang people|Dongxiang]] and [[Bonan people|Bao'an]] speakers, though there is no indication that such differences occur among native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon (2013) ''China's Muslim Hui Community: Migration, Settlement and Sects'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hezhou was once thought to be a Chinese language that had undergone heavy Turkic influence with an ongoing loss of tone; it is now believed to be the opposite, with tone acquisition perhaps ongoing.&lt;ref name=Mei&gt;Mei Lee-Smith (1996) "The Hezhou language", in Wurm et al. (eds) ''Atlas of Languages of Intercultural Communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas,'' pp 865&amp;ndash;874.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4906">'''INTSINT''' is an acronym for '''IN'''ternational '''T'''ranscription '''S'''ystem for '''INT'''onation.

It was originally developed by Daniel Hirst in his 1987 thesis as a [[prosodic]] equivalent of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], and the INTSINT alphabet was subsequently used in Hirst &amp; Di Cristo (eds) 1998 in just over half of the chapters.

==Description==
INTSINT codes the intonation of an utterance by means of an alphabet of 8 discrete symbols constituting a surface phonological representation of the intonation:

::'''T''' (Top), '''H''' (Higher), '''U''' (Upstepped), '''S''' (Same), '''M''' (mid), '''D''' (Downstepped), '''L''' (Lower), '''B''' (Bottom).

These tonal symbols are considered ''phonological'' in that they represent discrete categories and ''surface'' since each tonal symbol corresponds to a directly observable property of the speech signal.

===Tonal alignment===
The tones can be aligned with phonological constituents by means of the following alignment diacritics following the tonal symbol:

::[ (initial),  &lt; (early), : (medial), &gt; (late), ] (final)

The relevant phonological constituent with which the tonal segments are aligned can be taken as the sequence of symbols between the following pair of slashes /…/.

The following is an example of a transcription using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] (International Phonetic Alphabet) of a possible reading of the sentence "It's time to go :

::M:{{IPA|/ɪts/}}T:{{IPA|/taɪmtə/}}D&lt;B]{{IPA|/ɡoʊ/}}

This corresponds to a ''Mid'' tone aligned with the middle of the syllable "It's" then a ''Top'' tone aligned with the middle of the unit "time to" and then a ''Downstepped'' tone aligned early in the syllable "go" and a ''Bottom'' tone aligned with the end of the same syllable.

===Phonetic interpretation===
The phonetic interpretation of the INTSINT tonal segments can be carried out using two speaker dependent (or even utterance dependent) parameters.

::*'''key''': like a musical key, this establishes an absolute point of reference defined by a fundamental frequency value (in hertz).
::*'''range''': this determines the interval between the highest and lowest pitches of the utterance.

In the current algorithm (Hirst 2004, 2005) the tonal segments can be converted to target points, like those generated by the [[Momel]] algorithm, using the following equivalences. P(i) in the following formulae refers to the current Pitch target, P(i-1) to the preceding pitch target. Pitch targets are normally calculated on a logarithmic scale.

The targets '''T''', '''M''' and '''B''' are defined 'absolutely' without regard to the preceding targets
::*'''T''':  P(i) := key + range/2
::*'''M''': P(i) := key
::*'''B''':  P(i) := key - range/2

Other targets are defined with respect to the preceding target:

::*'''H''': P(i) := (P(i-1) + T) / 2
::*'''U''': P(i) := (3*P(i-1) + T) / 4
::*'''S''': P(i) := P(i-1)
::*'''D''': P(i) := (3*P(i-1) + B) / 4
::*'''L''': P(i) := (P(i-1) + B) / 2

====Example====
A sequence of tonal targets such as:
::[M T L H L H D B]
assuming values for a female speaker of ''key'' as 240&amp;nbsp;Hz and ''range'' as 1 octave, would be converted to the following F0 targets:
::[240 340 240 286 220 273 242 170]

An interesting consequence of this model is that it automatically introduces an asymptotic lowering of sequences such as '''H L H'''... such as has often been described both for languages with lexical tone and for languages where tone is only introduced by the intonation system, without the need to introduce a specific downdrift or declination component.

The particular values used for calculating the value of '''D''' and '''U''' were chosen so that in a sequence ['''T D'''] for example, the '''D''' tone is lowered by the same amount as the '''H''' tone in the sequence ['''T L H''']. In many phonological accounts, Downstepped tones are analysed as a High tone which is lowered by the presence of a "floating" low tone, so that the surface tone ['''D'''] can be considered as [[underlyingly]] ['''L H'''].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3083">'''Johanna Eleonora De la Gardie''' (1661 in [[Hamburg]] – 1708 in [[Stockholm]]), was a Swedish writer, [[poet]], [[lady-in-waiting]] and [[nobility|noblewoman]].

Johanna was the daughter of Pontus Fredrik De la Gardie and [[Beata Elisabet von Königsmarck]]. She received a cultivated education, along with her sister [[Ebba Maria De la Gardie]] and her cousins [[Amalia Wilhelmina Königsmarck]] and [[Maria Aurora of Königsmarck]]; her sister became a respected poet and [[singer]] at court. Johanna became lady-in-waiting and, with her sister, a favourite of Queen [[Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark]], and was also a friend of the queen dowager, [[Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp]].

Johanna participated at the [[amateur theatre]] of the royal court, encouraged by [[Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark|Queen Eleanora]]. In the winter of 1683-84, a group of female courtiers performed the Swedish premiere of ''[[Iphigénie]]'' by [[Jean Racine|Racine]] at court. In the play, Johanna acted the part of ''Iphigenie'', [[Amalia Königsmarck]] as ''Achilles'', [[Aurora Königsmarck]] as ''Clitemnestre'', Augusta Wrangel as ''Agamemnon'', and [[Ebba Maria De la Gardie]] as ''Eriphile''.&lt;ref&gt;Samlaren / 21:a årgången (1900) Runeberg&lt;/ref&gt; This is regarded as a significant event, the first play performed by an all–female cast in Sweden, as an introduction of French Classicism in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Löfgren (2003). Svensk teater. (Swedish theater) Stockholm: [[Natur &amp; Kultur]]. Sid. 46. {{ISBN|91-27-09672-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She wrote the French poem ''Portrait d’Ismène'' for Ulrika Eleonora, and the German–language psalm ''Weich, Falsche Welt''. She encouraged poets and writers; she is remembered as benefactor and teacher of the poet and politician [[List of Swedish poets#T|Samuel Triewald]].

In 1691, Johanna married her cousin, [[Count]] Erik Gustaf Stenbock. They lived in England until 1697, where she became popular at the English court of [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary]].

{{Forms of government}}

'''Kleptocracy''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κλέπτης ''kléptēs'', "thief", κλέπτω ''kléptō'', "I steal", and -κρατία -''kratía'' from κράτος ''krátos'', "power, rule") is a government with corrupt leaders (kleptocrats) that use their power to exploit the people and natural resources of their own territory in order to extend their personal wealth and political powers. Typically, this system involves embezzlement of funds at the expense of the wider population.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite|title=kleptocracy|date=n.d.|work=Dictionary.com Unabridged|accessdate=November 1, 2016|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/kleptocracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"Kleptocracy". ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford University Press. 1st ed. 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleptocracy is different from a [[plutocracy]]; A kleptocracy is a government ruled by corrupt politicians who use their political power to receive [[kickbacks]], [[bribes]], and special favors at the expense of the populace. Kleptocrats may use political leverage to pass laws that enrich them or their constituents and they usually circumvent the [[rule of law]].

==Characteristics==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
Kleptocracies are generally associated with [[dictatorship]]s, [[oligarchies]], [[military juntas]], or other forms of [[autocracy|autocratic]] and [[Nepotism|nepotist]] governments in which external oversight is impossible or does not exist. This lack of oversight can be caused or exacerbated by the ability of the kleptocratic officials to control both the supply of public funds and the means of disbursal for those funds. Kleptocratic rulers often treat their country's [[treasury]] as a source of personal wealth, spending funds on [[luxury good]]s and extravagances as they see fit. Many kleptocratic rulers secretly transfer public funds into hidden personal [[numbered bank account]]s in foreign countries to provide for themselves if removed from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/4462|title=KLEPTOCRACY AND DIVIDE-AND-RULE: A MODEL OF PERSONAL RULE|last=Robinson et al.|first=|date=15 November 2017|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleptocracy is most common in developing countries whose economies are based on the export of [[natural resource]]s. Such export incomes constitute a form of [[economic rent]] and are easier to siphon off without causing the income to decrease.

A specific case of kleptocracy is ''Raubwirtschaft'', German for "plunder economy" or "rapine economy", where the whole economy of the state is based on robbery, looting and plundering the conquered territories. Such states are either in continuous warfare with their neighbours or they simply milk their subjects as long as they have any taxable assets. [[Arnold Toynbee]] has claimed the [[Roman Empire]] was a ''Raubwirtschaft.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.derrickjensen.org/what-we-leave-behind/collapse-of-rome/|title=Collapse of Rome {{!}} The official Derrick Jensen site|website=www.derrickjensen.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial System ==
Contemporary studies have identified 21st century kleptocracy as a global [[financial system]] based on [[money laundering]] (which the [[International Monetary Fund]] has estimated comprises 2-5 percent of the global economy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooley|first=Alexander|last2=Sharman|first2=J. C.|date=2017/09|title=Transnational Corruption and the Globalized Individual|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/transnational-corruption-and-the-globalized-individual/18E7DAF986E65BF94BE2621163AEE891|journal=Perspectives on Politics|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=732–753|doi=10.1017/S1537592717000937|issn=1537-5927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/january-2018|title=January 2018 {{!}} Journal of Democracy|website=www.journalofdemocracy.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp021098|title=Money Laundering: the Importance of International Countermeasures--Address by Michel Camdessus|work=IMF|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleptocrats engage in [[money laundering]] to obscure the corrupt origins of their wealth and safeguard it from domestic threats such as economic instability and predatory kleptocratic rivals. They are then able to secure this wealth in assets and investments within more stable [[jurisdiction]]s, where it can then be stored for personal use, returned to the country of origin to support the kleptocrat's domestic activities, or deployed elsewhere to protect and project the regime's interests overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ned.org/the-rise-of-kleptocracy-a-challenge-for-democracy-by-christopher-walker-and-melissa-aten-in-the-journal-of-democracy/|title=The Rise of Kleptocracy: A Challenge for Democracy by Christopher Walker and Melissa Aten in the Journal of Democracy – NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY|website=www.ned.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illicit funds are typically transferred out of a kleptocracy into [[Western world|Western]] jurisdictions for money laundering and asset security. Since 2011, more than $1 trillion has left [[Developing country|developing countries]] annually in illicit financial outflows. A 2016 study found that $12 trillion had been siphoned out of [[Russia]], [[China]], and developing economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/08/offshore-finance-emerging-countries-russia-david-cameron-summit|title=Offshore finance: more than $12tn siphoned out of emerging countries|last=Stewart|first=Heather|date=2016-05-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western [[Professional services|professional services providers]] are an essential part of the kleptocratic financial system, exploiting legal and financial loopholes in their own jurisdictions to facilitate transnational money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/14/theres-a-dirty-little-secret-behind-western-condescension-toward-foreign-kleptocrats/|title=Analysis {{!}} How today's despots and kleptocrats hide their stolen wealth|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/unholy-alliance-kleptocratic-authoritarians-and-their-western-enablers|title=Unholy Alliance: Kleptocratic Authoritarians and their Western Enablers|work=World Affairs Journal|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kleptocratic financial system typically comprises four steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/laundrycycle.html|title=Money-Laundering Cycle|last=baaba.anum-kofi|website=www.unodc.org|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, kleptocrats or those operating on their behalf create [[Shell companies|anonymous shell companies]] to conceal the origins and ownership of the funds. Multiple interlocking networks of anonymous shell companies may be created and [[nominee director]]s appointed to further conceal the kleptocrat as the ultimate [[Beneficial ownership|beneficial owner]] of the funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/report/how-anonymous-shell-companies-finance-insurgents-criminals-and-dictators|title=How Anonymous Shell Companies Finance Insurgents, Criminals, and Dictators|website=Council on Foreign Relations|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, a kleptocrat's funds are transferred into the Western financial system via accounts which are subject to weak or nonexistent [[Bank Secrecy Act|anti-money laundering procedures]].

Third, financial transactions conducted by the kleptocrat in a Western country complete the integration of the funds. Once a kleptocrat has purchased an asset this can then be resold, providing a legally defensible origin of the funds. Research has shown the purchase of [[Real estate|luxury real estate]] to be a particularly favored method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/01/04/how-money-laundering-works-in-real-estate/|title=Analysis {{!}} How money laundering works in real estate|last=https://www.facebook.com/philip.bump|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/shell-company-towers-of-secrecy-real-estate|title=Towers of Secrecy: Piercing the Shell Companies|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth, kleptocrats may use their laundered funds to engage in reputation laundering, hiring [[public relations]] firms to present a positive public image and [[lawyer]]s to suppress journalistic scrutiny of their political connections and origins of their wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/05/reputation-laundering-is-lucrative-business-for-london-pr-firms|title='Reputation laundering' is lucrative business for London PR firms|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=2017-09-05|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/rise-kleptocracy-laundering-cash-whitewashing-reputations|title=The Rise of Kleptocracy: Laundering Cash, Whitewashing Reputations {{!}} Journal of Democracy|website=www.journalofdemocracy.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] is international kleptocrats' favoured jurisdiction for laundering money. In a 2011 forensic study of grand corruption cases, the [[World Bank]] found the United States was the leading jurisdiction of incorporation for entities involved in money laundering schemes.&lt;ref name="star.worldbank.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://star.worldbank.org/publication/puppet-masters|title=The Puppet Masters {{!}} Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR)|website=star.worldbank.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of Treasury]] estimates that $300 billion is laundered annually in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1230037/the-peculiarities-of-us-financial-system-make-it-ideal-for-money-laundering/|title=The peculiarities of the US financial system make it ideal for money laundering|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This kleptocratic financial system flourishes in the [[United States]] for three reasons. First, the absence of a [[Beneficial ownership|beneficial ownership registry]] means that it is the easiest country in the world in which to conceal the ownership of a company. The United States produces more than 2 million corporate entities a year, and 10 times more shell companies than 41 other countries identified as tax havens combined.&lt;ref name="star.worldbank.org"/&gt; It currently takes more information to obtain a library card than to form a US company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thefactcoalition.org/fact-sheet-anonymous-shell-companies-august-2017|title=FACT Sheet: Anonymous Shell Companies|date=2017-08-16|work=FACT Coalition|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, some of the professions most at risk of being exploited for money laundering by kleptocrats are not required to perform due diligence on prospective customers, including incorporation agents, lawyers, and realtors.&lt;ref name="fatf-gafi.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/u-z/unitedstates/documents/mer-united-states-2016.html|title=United States' measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing|website=www.fatf-gafi.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 undercover study found that just 10 of 1,722 U.S. [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation agents]] refused to create an anonymous company for a suspicious customer; a 2016 investigation found that just one of 13 prominent New York law firms refused to provide advice for a suspicious customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/undercover-investigation-american-lawyers-reveals-role-overseas-territories-moving-suspect-money-united-states/|title=Undercover investigation of American lawyers reveals role of Overseas Territories in moving suspect money into the United States {{!}} Global Witness|website=Global Witness|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, such anonymous companies can then freely engage in transactions without having to reveal their [[Beneficial ownership|beneficial owner]].

Currently, there are only around 1,200 money laundering convictions per year in the United States and money launderers face a less than five percent chance of conviction.&lt;ref name="fatf-gafi.org"/&gt; [[Raymond W. Baker|Raymond Baker]] estimates that law enforcement fails in 99.9% of cases to detect money laundering by kleptocrats and other financial criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thefactcoalition.org/countering-international-money-laundering|title=Countering International Money Laundering|date=2017-08-23|work=FACT Coalition|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Western jurisdictions favoured by kleptocrats include the [[United Kingdom]] and its dependencies, especially the [[British Virgin Islands]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/missing-bigger-picture-russian-money-uks-tax-havens/|title=Missing the bigger picture?

==Effects==
The effects of a kleptocratic regime or government on a nation are typically adverse in regards to the welfare of the state's [[economy]], political affairs, and [[civil right]]s. Kleptocratic governance typically ruins prospects of foreign investment and drastically weakens the domestic market and cross-border trade. As kleptocracies often embezzle money from their citizens by misusing funds derived from [[tax payment]]s, or engage heavily in money laundering schemes, they tend to heavily degrade quality of life for citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Bureaucratic-authoritarianism and the Forest Sector in Latin America | author= George M.

In addition, the money that kleptocrats steal is diverted from funds earmarked for public amenities such as the building of hospitals, schools, roads, parks – having further adverse effects on the quality of life of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2008/06/20080601225742srenod6.734866e-02.html|title=Combating Kleptocracy|date=December 6, 2006|access-date=2016-11-15|website=IIP Digital|publisher=Bureau of International Information Programs, U.S. State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; The informal oligarchy that results from a kleptocratic elite subverts democracy (or any other political format).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/2006/70236.htm|title=National Strategy Against High-Level Corruption: Coordinating International Efforts to Combat Kleptocracy|accessdate=8 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080710105943/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/2006/70236.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term kleptocracy was also used to refer to the [[Russia]]n economy, soon after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet collapse]] in 1991. The "democrats", led by Yegor Gaidar and Anatoly Chubais, freed prices in 1992 and unleashed hyperinflation before they privatized Russia's assets. Most Russian citizens lost their savings in only a few weeks. A few billionaire "oligarchs" amassed fortunes not by creating new enterprises, but by arbitraging the huge difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market. Instead of investing in the Russian economy, they stashed billions of dollars in [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss bank account]]s. Experts estimate that as much as $15&amp;nbsp;billion left Russia each year as either capital flight or laundered money from illegal transactions.&lt;ref name=Granville&gt;Johanna Granville, [https://www.academia.edu/5597850/The_Russian_Kleptocracy_and_Rise_of_Organized_Crime "''Dermokratizatsiya'' and ''Prikhvatizatsiya'': The Russian Kleptocracy and Rise of Organized Crime,"]''Demokratizatsiya'' (summer 2003), pp. 448-457.&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to Russia, Daniel Kimmage also used the terms: "kerdocracy" ("rule based on the desire for material gain") or "khrematisamenocracy" ("rule by those who transact business for their own profit").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kimmage |first=Daniel |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Russia_Changes_Balance_In_Caucasus/1190395.html |title=Russian 'Hard Power' Changes Balance In Caucasus |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2008-08-12 |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

[[File:GB 1892 1d uprated lettercard.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|1892 imprinted 1d letter card uprated with 1d and 1/2d [[postage stamp]]s sent from London to Germany; complete with selvages]]
[[File:Air mail letter card 1943.jpg|right|thumb|1943 use of an early [[aerogram]]me inscribed ''Air Mail Letter Card''. The fact that it has an [[Adhesive postage stamp|adhesive stamp]], rather than a prepaid [[imprinted stamp]] or [[indicium]], means that it is ''not'' postal stationery. Instead, it is a [[formular]] air letter card]]

In [[philately]] a '''lettercard''' or '''letter card''' is a [[postal stationery]] item consisting of a folded card with a prepaid [[imprinted stamp]].  The fact that it is folded over gives the writer twice as much room for the message compared with a [[postal card]].  The message is written on the inside and the card is then folded and sealed around the edges. The recipient tears off and discards the perforated selvages to open the card.

The lettercard was first conceived by a Hungarian named Akin Karoly&lt;ref name=VanGelder&gt;Van Gelder, Peter J.; ''The Collectors' Guide to Postal Stationery'', A Squirel Publication (1997) {{ISBN|0-947604-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced in Belgium in 1882.&lt;ref name=postalstationery&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linns.com/reference/stationery/basic_stationery.aspx|title=''Postal Stationery'' in Linns.com Reference section }}&lt;/ref&gt; Private issues were used in Great Britain in 1887.&lt;ref name="mackay"&gt;Mackay, James. ''Philatelic Terms Illustrated''. 4th edition. London: Stanley Gibbons, 2003, p.78. {{ISBN|0-85259-557-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first official British letter card was issued in 1892.&lt;ref name=mackay/&gt; In Newfoundland ''reply lettercards'' were introduced in 1912 which included a small reply card.&lt;ref name=mackay/&gt;  The United States has never issued letter cards.&lt;ref name=postalstationery /&gt;

Collectors of letter cards not only have to deal with the varieties of card stock and color, but with the additional variations that come with the perforation of the cards.&lt;ref name=VanGelder /&gt; As with [[Adhesive postage stamp|adhesive stamps]], a perforation gauge will be a useful tool of the trade.

The terms ''Letter Card'' or ''Air Mail Letter Card'' were sometimes used on [[aerogram]]mes prior to 1952, the year that the [[U.P.U.]] gave official recognition of the word ''aerogramme''.&lt;ref name=VanGelder /&gt;  But for aerograms, those terms are misleading.  The use of the word "card" implies a heavier card stock when, in fact, many of these "cards" were actually printed on light paper and were [[letter sheet]]s instead of letter cards.

This is a list of [[shorthand]]s, both modern and ancient. Currently, only one shorthand ([[Duployan shorthand|Duployan]]) has been given an [[ISO 15924|ISO code]], in preparation for inclusion in the [[Unicode Standard]], although the [[Tironian et]] has already been included in Unicode.

In [[cinematography]], a '''low-angle shot''', is a [[shot (film)|shot]] from a [[camera angle]] positioned low on the vertical axis, anywhere below the eye line, looking up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/low+angle+shot "Low angle shot."] ''Dictionary.com''.  2014.  9 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, it is even directly below the subject's feet. Psychologically, the effect of the low-angle shot is that it makes the subject look strong and powerful.

==Famous examples==
*''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (1931) (directed by [[Fritz Lang]]): Inspector Karl Lohmann is shot in low angle in his office, the camera sitting underneath his office desk. Also, two disputing men, one small and the other tall, are shot in low and high angles, respectively.
*''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (directed by [[Orson Welles]]): there are many examples such as during the scene where Kane fires Leland. In fact, the  scene where Leland confronts Kane  after his defeat in the election is entirely shot in a low angle view.
*''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]): the house where Norman Bates lives is usually shot from a low angle.
*''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (directed by [[George Lucas]]): Darth Vader is often shot at a low angle, for example, the first time we see his character as he is walking down a hallway.
*''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (directed by [[Orson Welles]]): Hank Quinlan is often shot in low angle to make him look menacing, large, and in-charge.
*''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (directed by [[John Badham]]): In the famous opening sequence, there are several shots from a low angle to emphasize Tony Manero's delusions that he is untouchable.
*''[[The Lady From Shanghai]]'' (directed by [[Orson Welles]]): examples of low-angle shot are during the scene where George Grisby is confronted by Broome and he shoots him.
* Used while filming [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] interviews with [[André the Giant]].
*''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (directed by [[Christopher Nolan]]): Nolan uses extremely low angle shots to give the Joker a more powerful image in The Dark Knight, especially during the scene where the truck he was driving is flipped over and he gets out and starts shooting at Batman. In this scene, the angle actually goes from a normal medium close up and slowly moves into a low angle shot.
*''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]]): examples of a low angle shot is during the scene where the boot camp Sgt. is yelling at Joker.
*''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (directed by [[Brian De Palma]]): there is a low-angle shot during the scene where Frank Nitti is being searched outside the courtroom and Elliot Ness finds the matches with Malone's address.
*"[[Dr. Strangelove]]" (directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]]): General Jack D. Ripper is shot at a low angle while smoking a cigar, in order to look comically menacing.

[[File:Manuel Querino.jpg|thumb|right|Manuel Raimundo Querino]]
'''Manuel Raimundo Querino''' (July 28, 1851 - February 14, 1923) was a [[Brazil]]ian scholar of African descent. He was a student and founder of the Liceu de Artes e Ofícios da Bahia and the Escola de Belas Artes and was a pioneering writer of the [[Anthropology]] of [[Africa]]n [[Culture]] in [[Bahia]].

==Character biography==

Querino was born in [[Santo Amaro, Bahia]]. He was orphaned by the [[cholera]] epidemic of 1855. So at the age of four, he was sent to Salvador to be raised by a guardian, Manuel Correia Garcia, a professor at the Normal School in that city.

He served in the military, first in the states of [[Pernambuco]] and [[Piauí]], later as clerk at his battalion's Rio de Janeiro headquarters during the [[Paraguayan War]].

He then dedicated himself to drawing and painting, which he studied at the [[Liceu de Artes e Ofícios]] as well as at the Academia de Belas Artes, where he also worked. Querino graduated in [[geometric design]] and taught at the Liceu and at the Colégio de Órfãos de São Joaquim. He produced two textbooks on geometric design.

Manuel Querino was also active in politics as an abolitionist and later founded the Partido Operário (Workers' Party) and the Liga Operária Baiana (Bahian Workers' League). He engaged in intellectual debates against the racist and elitist science of his time, spearheaded by pathologist Raimundo Nina Rodrigues.

The famous Bahian writer [[Jorge Amado]] drew on this as an inspiration for creating his character Pedro Archanjo, the central figure of his 1969 novel ''Tenda dos Milagres'' (''[[Tent of Miracles (novel)|Tent of Miracles]]'').

==Citations==

"Bahia reaches superiority, excellence, and primacy in the culinary art of the country as the African element, with its exquisite seasoning of exotic fertilizers, altered profoundly the Portuguese delicacies, which resulted in a completely national product, tasty, pleasant to the palate yet demanding, which surpases the righteous fame of Bahian cuisine." (QUERINO, 1922, p. 23)

"Brazil owns two real treasures: the fertility of its soil and the abilities of its mulattos." (Querino 1918: The black settler as a factor of Brazil's civilization)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1734">[[Image:Prag postmarks.png|thumb|A study of the postmarks of [[Prague]] between 1850 and 1888.]]

'''Marcophily''', occasionally called '''Marcophilately''', is the specialised study and collection of [[postmark]]s, [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellation]]s and [[postal markings]] applied by hand or machine on [[mail]] that passes through a [[postal system]] and applied by the [[postal administration|postal operator]] through whose [[Territory (country subdivision)|domain]] they pass. Commatology was a term used prior to [[World War II]] but is rarely used today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/reference/terms/terms.asp?firstletter=c Glossary Of Philatelic Terms (retrieved 25 February 2007)] Linns.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcophilists are more interested in the details, style and design of the markings than why and where a letter was sent. Large cities that have many [[post office]]s offer great study opportunities due to the vast range of handstamps or [[Machine postmark|machine cancellations]] in use over any time period. It offers vast study areas to select a topic from for study or collection.

While strictly speaking it is not a [[postal history]] topic it can be collected and studied as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Vivien J. | last=Sussex | year=1988 | title='''Introducing Postal History''' | chapter=1 | pages=5| publisher=British Philatelic Trust in conjunction with The Postal History Society, London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Michael Weiner, he has written books on [[nutrition]], [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]], and [[homeopathy]]; as Michael Savage, he has written four political books that have reached ''[[The New York Times Best Seller list]]''.

Savage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: [[border]]s, language, and culture.

Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes.

His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous [[psychedelic drug]] advocate [[Timothy Leary]] as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in [[Millbrook, New York]], to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].&lt;ref name="sfsavage" /&gt; Savage then studied at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]], earning a [[Master of Science]] in [[botany]] in 1970 and a [[Master of Arts]] in [[anthropology]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Michael Alan|title=Medicinal plants of Tonga|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/36042/Weiner_1970_r.pdf|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|year=1970|format=Thesis (M.A.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Degrees Awarded in Anthropology: MAs - 1970 to 1979|url=http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/alumni/mas1970-1979.html|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|access-date=June 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825092120/http://anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/alumni/mas1970-1979.html|archivedate=August 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1978 from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in [[nutrition]]al [[ethnomedicine]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name="UCBL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunsite5.berkeley.edu:8000/WebZ/FETCH?sessionid=01-49886-1724585769&amp;recno=14&amp;resultset=2&amp;format=F&amp;next=html/record.html&amp;bad=error/badfetch.html&amp;:entitytoprecno=14:entitycurrecno=14 |title="UC Berkeley Pathfinder" |access-date=October 5, 2006 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref name=mrangry&gt;{{cite news | title = Michael Savage: Mr Angry | author=Guy Adams | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-savage-mr-angry-1681844.html | work=The Independent | publisher=Independent News &amp; Media PLC | location = London | date = May 9, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716195310/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-savage-mr-angry-1681844.html|archivedate=July 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[thesis]] was titled ''Nutritional Ethnomedicine in [[Fiji]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Michael Alan|year=1978|title=Nutritional ethnomedicine in Fiji|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3287378|work=Dissertation Abstracts International|volume=41|issue=12|page=4468|format=Thesis (Ph.D.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shift in political opinions==
Savage introduced himself to certain writers in the [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] neighborhood of San Francisco in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2003/03/05/savage_11/singleton/ |title=Michael Savage's long, strange trip |access-date=November 10, 2011 |last=Gilson |first=David |date=March 5, 2003 |publisher=Salon.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121163922/http://www.salon.com/2003/03/05/savage_11/singleton/ |archivedate=November 21, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He befriended and traveled with [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]]. Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and three postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="sfsavage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GQ"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tapper |first=Jake |authorlink=Jake Tapper |date=September 2003 |title=The Savage Mind |work=[[GQ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could "hear and see and know why I adore your public image."&lt;ref name="man behind" /&gt; Another acquaintance was poet and author [[Neeli Cherkovski]], who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comic]] in the mold of [[Lenny Bruce]].&lt;ref name="sfsavage" /&gt;

Acquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, "I was once a child; I am now a man."&lt;ref name="man behind" /&gt; Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on [[welfare]] were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a [[social work]]er.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Savage |first = Michael |title = The Savage Nation |publisher=[[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] |year= 2002 |page = 181 |isbn = 0-7852-6353-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes.&lt;ref name="Playboy" /&gt; Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as "political opposition" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Savage |first = Michael A. |title = Maximum Immunity |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] |year= 1986 |page = 207 |isbn = 0-395-37910-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, ''Immigrants and Epidemics'', was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Hirsen |first = James L. |title = Savage Exposes 'The Enemy Within' |publisher=FirstLiberties.com |date = January 28, 2004|url = http://www.firstliberties.com/savage_exposes_enemy.html |access-date = September 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the [[UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism|Graduate School of Journalism]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar [[Orville Schell]]. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; Savage later dropped the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Savage Talk" /&gt;

==Career as commentator==
{{Main|The Savage Nation}}

===Radio===
The rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about [[illegal immigration]] and [[epidemic]]s prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barbs"&gt;{{Cite AV media |people = Michael Savage |title = The Best of the Savage Nation – Volume 2: Barbs on the Berries |medium = CD |publisher=Savage Productions |date= 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on [[KGO (AM)|KGO]] (a San Francisco news/[[talk radio]] station) as a fill-in host for the liberal [[Ray Taliaferro]] and later as a weekend host. At the time, his slogan was "To the right of [[Rush Limbaugh|Rush]] and to the left of God." On January 1, 1995, he was given his own show during the drive-time hours on sister station KSFO. The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage reached #1 in [[Nielsen Audio|Arbitron]] ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time-slot.

In mid 2006, Savage had 8–10&amp;nbsp;million listeners per week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Top Talk Radio Audiences |publisher=Talkers Magazine  |date= September 2007 |url = http://www.talkers.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=34|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061114200439/http://www.talkers.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=34|archivedate = November 14, 2006|access-date = June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as "literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy." He has described his show's production as one with a "...&amp;nbsp;hard edge combined with humor and education&amp;nbsp;... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of [[Plato]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], and [[Frankenstein]]."&lt;ref name="MSB" /&gt; Mark de la Viña of the ''[[The Mercury News|San Jose Mercury News]]'' wrote of Savage: "In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, [[Sean Hannity]] and [[Laura Schlessinger]], Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab."&lt;ref name="man behind" /&gt;

By 2009, ''The Savage Nation'' had an audience of 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time.&lt;ref name="Hinckley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marinucci" /&gt; Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by [[Kelefa Sanneh]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]''; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the ''New Yorker'' profile, titled "Party of One", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanneh |first=Kelefa |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/08/03/090803fa_fact_sanneh?currentPage=all |title=Party of One: Michael Savage, Unexpurgated |work=The New Yorker |date=August 3, 2009|pages=50–57|volume=85|issue=23|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

On September 10, 2009, [[KNEW (AM)|KNEW-AM]] (910&amp;nbsp;kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with [[John and Ken]] from sister station [[KFI]]-AM (640&amp;nbsp;kHz)/Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fong-Torres|first=Ben|title=Rothmann named as Ward's replacement|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/Rothmann-named-as-Ward-s-replacement-3285100.php|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 4, 2009|pages=Q40}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an e-mail that the station was headed "...&amp;nbsp;in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Savage off the air in S.F.|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/article/Michael-Savage-off-the-air-in-S-F-3217723.php|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=September 11, 2009|pages=D4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914115152/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2009%2F09%2F11%2FBAEC19LCOS.DTL|archivedate=September 14, 2009|deadurl=no|access-date=May 2, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arbitron monthly ratings, [[KNEW (AM)|KNEW-AM]] dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station [[KTRB]] picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/athletics/article/A-s-radio-flagship-goes-bust-3175177.php | work=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Susan | last=Slusser | title=A's radio flagship goes bust | date=September 12, 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105095606/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2010%2F09%2F11%2FSPLP1FCB39.DTL | archivedate=November 5, 2010 | deadurl=no | page=B5 | access-date=May 2, 2018 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for ''[[Playboy]]'' had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the ''Playboy'' writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the ''[[The Savage Nation|Savage Nation]]'' but a critic of the profile done by ''The New Yorker''. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to "rattle" ''Playboy''{{'}}s readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. ''Playboy'' published the interview in June 2010.&lt;ref name="Playboy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hochman |first=David |title=Michael Savage: Playboy interview |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/michael-savage-playboy-interview/ |work=Playboy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511092038/http://www.playboy.com/articles/michael-savage-playboy-interview/ |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |date=June 2010 |deadurl=no }} .&lt;/ref&gt; He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word ''Playboy'' interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of [[journalistic objectivity]], but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the ''New Yorker'' interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a "real writer" who had understood his subject.

On September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with [[Talk Radio Network]], his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCartney|first=Anthony|title=Michael Savage leaves radio show after legal win|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_PEOPLE_MICHAEL_SAVAGE?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-09-27-22-07-27|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=September 28, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928071952/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_PEOPLE_MICHAEL_SAVAGE?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-09-27-22-07-27|archivedate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via [[Ustream]] on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator [[Cumulus Media Networks]] announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Marcucci, Carl.

This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/michael-savage-sean-hannity-cumulus_n_3995524.html|work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|author=Fung, Katherine|title=Michael Savage Getting Sean Hannity's Timeslot|date=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, it was announced that Savage and Westwood One had reached agreement on a long-term contract renewal for ''The Savage Nation''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/137287/michael-savage-renews-with-westwood-one/ "Michael Savage Renews With Westwood One"], Allaccess.com.

===MSNBC television show===
Savage was hired by [[MSNBC]] president Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book ''[[The Savage Nation (book)|The Savage Nation]]'' and the objections of [[NBC]] employees including news anchor [[Tom Brokaw]], who asked NBC executives, "Is this the sort of man who embodies the values of NBC?"&lt;ref name="GQ" /&gt; Sorenson, at the time, called Savage "brash, passionate and smart," and promised that he would provide "compelling opinion and analysis with an edge."&lt;ref name="FAIR" /&gt;

Four months later, on July 7, Savage was fired from his MSNBC television show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as [[prank call]]er Bob Foster, who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage then asked if Foster was a "[[sodomy|sodomite]]", to which the caller answered, "Yes, I am." Savage then said to the caller,

{{quote|Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] and die, you pig; how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig?

The day after being fired, Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fost |first=Dan |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/07/09/MN158024.DTL&amp;ao=all |title=Savage Says He's Sorry But Stays Fired |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=July 9, 2003 |access-date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
Savage describes the [[European Union]] as "Hitler's dream of a united Europe under German control." He equates Britain's [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|vote to leave the Union]] with the Second World War, saying it was "in many ways the [[Battle of Britain]] all over again." Savage foresees that, after [[Brexit]], the E.U. risks igniting a civil war to gain total control of the population for their plans of "a new Soviet-style superstate, which have been long on the drawing books."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTcet3vbaiA|title=The Savage Nation – Episode 19|last=Savage|first=Michael|date=|website=YouTube|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
===Legal defense contributions===
Savage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] accused of [[Haditha massacre|murdering civilians]] in [[Haditha|Haditha, Iraq]]; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homestead.com/prosites-prs/shackled.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012164021/http://www.homestead.com/prosites-prs/shackled.html |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |title=Shackled Marine Update |access-date=September 21, 2007 |author=Jeremiah J.

The Marines were ultimately found not guilty.

==Awards and criticism==
===Awards===
On June 9, 2007, ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'' awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," and he accepted it with a pre-recorded speech.&lt;ref name="newsblaze.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Savage Honored with Freedom of Speech Award |url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20070328082543nnnn.np/topstory.html |work=News Blaze |access-date=September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''National Radio Hall of Fame'''&lt;/big&gt;

===Criticism===
In July 2005, former CBS reporter [[Bernard Goldberg]] ranked Savage as number 61 in his book ''[[100 People Who Are Screwing Up America]]''. Goldberg wrote that "Savage's brand of over-the-top [[bile]]&amp;nbsp;... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the [[Left-wing politics|Left]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Dhingra | first =Philip | title =''Who is in Bernard Goldberg's 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America?

On April 17, 2006, Savage was seriously criticized worldwide after he said on the topic of Muslims, "They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100&amp;nbsp;million of them, then there'll be 900&amp;nbsp;million of them.' I mean, would you rather die—would you rather us die than them?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2008/01/04/oped_resp_stillwell.DTL |title= SF Chronicle Free Speech vs Hate Speech |access-date= May 10, 2009 | first=Safaa | last=Ibrahim | date=January 3, 2008 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.&lt;ref name="Ref-4"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech|author=Leith, Sam|date=May 6, 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/07/radio-michael-savage-ban-britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the actor [[Robin Williams]]' [[suicide]], Savage said that suicide is an "aggressive act" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind.&lt;ref name=MM&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Media Matters for America]]|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/10/21/michael-savages-disgusting-rant-ptsd-and-depres/201248|title=Michael Savage's Disgusting Rant: PTSD And Depression Sufferers Are "Weak," "Narcissistic," "Losers"|date=October 21, 2014|author=Hananoki, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion prompted criticism,&lt;ref name=MM /&gt;

====Catholic Church and immigration====
In March 2006, Savage criticised [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal [[Roger Mahony]] of Los Angeles calling it "pastoral support").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/4/3/162352.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910220924/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/4/3/162352.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |title=Savage Remarks Anger Catholics |publisher=[[Newsmax Media]] |date=April 3, 2006 |access-date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Donohue]] of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] canceled an appearance on the show, saying "what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1107 |title=Michael Savage's Catholicism |access-date=July 9, 2011 |date=March 30, 2006 |author=[[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120234511/http://catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1107 |archivedate=November 20, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2006, Savage encouraged his listeners to burn [[Flag of Mexico|Mexican flags]] to counter pro-immigration rallies in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kim|last=Myung Oak|title=Foreign flags create flap Mexican banners at recent rallies prompt backlash|publisher=''Rocky Mountain News''|date=March 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====C-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award====
When ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'' awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," [[C-SPAN]] opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Savage.&lt;ref name="newsblaze.com" /&gt; Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2007/06/c-span-shares-lamb-skewers-on-air-004576?paginate=false|title=C-SPAN shares Lamb skewers on air|author=Mortman, Howard|work=Politico|date=June 21, 2007|access-date=August 13, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625212709/http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=4AFF492C-3048-5C12-0025D780C6B9F45C|archivedate=June 25, 2007|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dispute with CAIR====
In early November 2007, the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims "need [[deportation]]", and that adherents of Islam would do well to "take your religion and shove it up your behind" because "I'm sick of you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/17sava.html|title=Boycotted Radio Host Remains Unbowed|first=Jacques|last=Steinberg|date=December 17, 2007|work=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221095258/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/17sava.html?ei=5088&amp;en=0052db888e9244dc&amp;ex=1355547600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|archivedate=December 21, 2007|access-date=February 11, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting [[Hamas]].

On November 5, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, [[Citrix Systems|Citrix Systems, Inc.]] pulled its advertisements from his show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClellan|first=Steve|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/citrix-pulls-spots-savage-nation-91037/ |title=Citrix Pulls Spots From ‘Savage Nation’|work=Adweek|date=November 13, 2007|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage sued CAIR for [[copyright]] infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website.&lt;ref&gt;Judi McLeod, [http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/927 "One for Savage, zero for CAIR"],  canadafreepress.com, December 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was "deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the [[Quran|Qur'an]] as "a throwback document" and a "book of hate". CAIR called the suit "bizarre, sloppy and baseless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Curtis| first =Kim | title =Radio host Michael Savage sues Islamic organization over ads | publisher=[[The Press-Enterprise]]| date =December 3, 2007| url =http://www.pe.com/ap_news/California/CA_Radio_Host_Lawsuit_317999C.shtml| access-date =December 4, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, 2008, [[United States district court]] Judge [[Susan Illston]] dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Egelko|first=Bob|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Suit-against-Savage-Nation-radio-host-tossed-3275816.php|title=Suit against 'Savage Nation' radio host tossed|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 26, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731003952/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2008%2F07%2F25%2FBA2111VQOI.DTL|archivedate=July 31, 2008|deadurl=no|accessdate=May 2, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, [[Daniel Horowitz]], announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Egelko| first = Bob| title = Radio host drops lawsuit against Islamic group| newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]| pages = B–4| date = August 15, 2008| url = https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Radio-host-drops-lawsuit-against-Islamic-group-3273421.php| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080815135155/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2008%2F08%2F14%2FBAPR12BDPO.DTL| archivedate = August 15, 2008| deadurl = no| access-date = May 2, 2018| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage, Judge Illston denied that request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rbr.com/michael-savage-beats-cair-again-in-court-ruling/|title=Michael Savage beats CAIR again in court ruling|work=Radio Business Report|date=January 28, 2009|volume=26|issue=18|accessdate=May 2, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604224117/http://rbr.com/radio/12543.html|archivedate=June 4, 2009|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autism====
In July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of [[autism]] diagnoses was the result of "a racket" designed to get disability payments for "poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government."&lt;ref name=NYDN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/radio-host-michael-savage-incites-protests-autism-comments-article-1.350990|title=Radio host Michael Savage incites protests with autism comments|last=Sandoval|first=Edgar|last2=Kennedy|first2=Helen|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=July 21, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724233046/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/07/21/2008-07-21_radio_host_michael_savage_incites_protes.html|archivedate=July 24, 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:

On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been "ripped out of context" by "far left [[Stalinism|Stalinists]]" who want him off of the air. He appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' with [[Glenn Beck]] as the substitute host for [[Larry King]], and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the [[overdiagnosis]] of children due to [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]]' drive to drug children for higher profits.&lt;ref name=NYDN /&gt; On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including [[RadioShack]], [[Sears]], [[The Home Depot]], and [[DirectBuy]], will discontinue their support for Savage's show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Autism group: Advertisers dropping Savage |last=Rosen |first=Daniel |newspaper=Newsday |date=July 25, 2008 |access-date=July 25, 2008 |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-nysava0726,0,3274609.story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728100819/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-nysava0726%2C0%2C3274609.story |archivedate=July 28, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage's syndicator, [[Talk Radio Network]], has responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728072736/http://www.savageonautism.com/|archivedate=July 28, 2008|title=20 audio clips of Michael Savage's comments on Autism|publisher=Talk Radio Network|url=http://www.savageonautism.com|access-date=September 20, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Banned from entering the United Kingdom====
On May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Jacqui Smith]] that Savage was on a [[list of people banned from entering the United Kingdom]] as he is "considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering [[hatred]] which might lead to inter-community violence".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |title=UK 'least wanted' list published |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8033060.stm |publisher=BBC |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCNews"&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Who is on UK least wanted list' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8033319.stm |publisher=BBC |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5282245/US-talkshow-host-to-sue-Jacqui-Smith-over-ban-from-Britain.html US talkshow host Michael Savage to sue Jacqui Smith over ban from Britain] Alex Spillius, telegraph.co.uk, May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/hate-promoters-banned-UK-named |title=Home Office name hate promoters excluded from the UK |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=May 6, 2009 |publisher=UK Home Office |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507181855/http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/hate-promoters-banned-UK-named |archivedate=May 7, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for [[defamation]], calling her a "lunatic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8035114.stm |title=US 'hate list' DJ to sue Britain |publisher=BBC News |work=|access-date=May 5, 2009 | date=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a subsequent [[NPR]] talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the [[United States Constitution]]'s [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. After host [[Neal Conan]] pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, "No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic&amp;nbsp;... to link me up with [[White power skinhead|Nazi skinheads]] who are killing people in [[Russia]]&amp;nbsp;... to put me in league with [[Hamas]] murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing".&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Savage Banned in The UK |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=103819122 |work=[[NPR]] |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=August 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball."&lt;ref&gt;Kate Kelland

You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

Of the banning, the [[Mayor of London]], [[Boris Johnson]], wrote:
"America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed&amp;nbsp;... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle&amp;nbsp;... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/5304788/Michael-Savage-poses-no-risk-to-British-security-so-why-wont-MPs-say-so.html Michael Savage poses no risk to British security so why won't MPs say so?] Boris Johnson, The Daily Telegraph, May 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Catherine Bennett (journalist)|Catherine Bennett]] wrote: "The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/10/michael-savage-radio-homeopathy-jacqui-smith Yes Jacqui, let's keep out those dangerous homeopaths] Catherine Bennett, ''The Guardian'', May 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While Sam Leith wrote: "Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech."&lt;ref name="Ref-4" /&gt;

====Veteran PTSD====
On October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], accusing them of "weakness". According to Savage, "Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything&amp;nbsp;... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military."&lt;ref name=MM2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/michael-savage-rants-against-military-ptsd-sufferers-no-wonder-isis-can-defeat-us/|title=Michael Savage Rants Against Military PTSD Sufferers: ‘No Wonder ISIS Can Defeat’ Us|website=www.mediaite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
While in the South Pacific, he became fascinated with the 19th-century sailor [[Charles Savage (beachcomber)|Charles Savage]], who was believed to have been the first man to bring firearms to [[Fiji]].&lt;ref name="Savage Talk"&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Fost |title=Savage talk: A Former Herbalist has Remade Himself into the Vitriol-Spewing King of the Bay Area's Afternoon Drive Time |url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/SAVAGE-TALK-A-former-herbalist-has-remade-2672863.php |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 6, 2003 |access-date=August 13, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030224065821/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2003%2F02%2F06%2FDD165846.DTL |archivedate=February 24, 2003 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; That fascination led to Weiner's name change to Savage.

During the 1980s, Savage attended Friday night services at a Jewish Synagogue [[Chabad house]] in Berkeley.&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt; In a 2003 interview on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', Savage has said that although he believes in God, he attends houses of worship only once or twice a year.&lt;ref name="O'Reilly"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Reilly|first=Bill|title=Radio Talk Show Host Michael Savage|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/2003/09/16/radio-talk-show-host-michael-savage/print|work=The O'Reilly Factor|publisher=Fox News|access-date=July 17, 2011|date=September 16, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725060653/http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/2003/09/16/radio-talk-show-host-michael-savage/print|archivedate=July 25, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2012 book ''Trickle Down Tyranny'', Savage wrote: "...&amp;nbsp;I'm not religious.

Savage is noted as a supporter of wildlife conservation efforts, speaking out against the poaching of elephants in Africa. He has pleaded on his show and called upon President Donald J. Trump to reinstate a ban on the importation of elephant trophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Green |first1=Miranda |title=Elephant trophy decision faces pushback from some Trump allies |url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/377471-gop-torn-on-elephant-trophy-ruling-as-trump-stays-quiet |work=The Hill |date=8 March 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage has had many pet dogs throughout his life, his current one being Teddy, a toy poodle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://canadafreepress.com/article/even-michael-savages-beloved-poodleteddy-not-safe-from-crazed-anti-trump-at|title=Even Michael Savage’s beloved poodle,’Teddy’ not safe from crazed anti-Trump attac|website=canadafreepress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage has met with President Trump on numerous occasions and was formally invited to the White House to meet with the President and Vice President Mike Pence. He had not been in Washington D.C. for three decades prior this visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/apr/24/inside-the-beltway-michael-savage-goes-to-washingt/|title=Inside the Beltway: Michael Savage goes to Washington, the White House included|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In total, Savage has written 40 books, twenty under his real name of Michael Weiner, and twenty under his pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include two #1 ''New York Times'' Best Sellers and three additional books which made ''[[The New York Times Best Seller list]]''.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hawes New York Times Best Seller list |url=http://www.hawes.com/2004/2004-01-18.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106021054/http://www.hawes.com/2004/2004-01-18.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 6, 2009 |access-date=May 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Hawes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hawes New York Times Best Seller list |url=http://www.hawes.com/2005/2005-05-01.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006150437/http://www.hawes.com/2005/2005-05-01.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 6, 2008 |access-date=May 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Hawes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hawes New York Times Best Seller list |url=http://www.hawes.com/2006/2006-05-14.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121012104/http://www.hawes.com/2006/2006-05-14.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 21, 2008 |access-date=May 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Hawes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.

His earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his doctoral expertise in the field of [[nutrition]]al [[ethnomedicine]]. In them, he advocates [[nutrition]]al, [[Herbalism|herbal]], and [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as [[Malnutrition|poor diet]], [[Ageing|aging]], [[arthritis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cancer]], [[Allergy|allergies]], [[Cocaine dependence|cocaine addiction]], the [[common cold]], and [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Michael-A.-Weiner/e/B001HCYZ9W|title=Michael A. Weiner|website=www.amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written about [[tree planting]], [[Beer sommelier#Beer tasting|beer-tasting]], and [[Nutrition|nutritional cooking]].&lt;ref name="amazon.com" /&gt;

His more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.

In 1991, Savage self-published ''The Death of the White Male'', an argument against [[affirmative action]], through Quantum Books.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite web|title =Entry for: ''The death of the white male'' |work=[[WorldCat]].org |url =http://worldcat.org/oclc/54958700?tab=holdings |access-date =January 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action "[[reverse discrimination]]", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sponsor the Paul Revere Society |work=Paul Revere Society website |url=http://www.olsenclan.com/clients/savage/prs_sponsor.shtml |access-date=January 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211084614/http://www.olsenclan.com/clients/savage/prs_sponsor.shtml |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2003, Savage published ''The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture'', his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of ''The New York Times Best Seller list]'', earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The book directs attacks at "liberal [[media bias]]", the "dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'", [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay activists]], and liberals.

In January 2004, Savage published his second political book ''[[The Enemy Within (Savage book)|The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military]]''. His next book, ''[[Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder]]'', was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike ''The Savage Nation'', both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In April 2006, Savage released ''[[The Political Zoo]]''. The book contains [[Satire|satirical]] profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, depicted in [[caricature]] as animals in the "Political Zoo", with Savage portrayed as the zoo keeper.

In October 2010, Savage released ''Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security''. Released through the [[HarperCollins]] imprint of [[William Morrow and Company]], Savage argues in the book that "Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this [[Marxism|Marxist]]/[[Leninism|Leninist]]-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses."&lt;ref&gt;Boog, Jason. "[http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/michael-savage-sells-trickle-up-poverty-to-william-morrow_b11988 Michael Savage Sells 'Trickle Up Poverty' to William Morrow]". ''Galleycat''. Media Bistro. June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, ''[[Abuse of Power]]'', was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on "My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know", said Savage. It is set in [[San Francisco]], mainly in [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]], as well as [[London]], and [[Tel Aviv]]. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as "the Hand of Allah". The publisher has described the novel by saying, "will make 9/11 look like child's play".&lt;ref&gt;Bosman, Julie.

In 2014, Savage released ''Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth'', in which Savage writes in part, "We are under assault from both inside and out as our government moves to consolidate its domestic power, while at the same time weakening our defenses against the growing power of our enemies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/18/book-review-how-a-divided-nation-can-proceed/|last=Vernon|first=Wes|work=The Washington Times|date=November 18, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119203910/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/18/book-review-how-a-divided-nation-can-proceed/?page=all|archivedate=November 19, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Savage released another New York Times Best Seller titled ''Government Zero: No Borders, No Language, No Culture.'' It tells of how the country has been left without the founding principles of his radio show, "borders, language and culture," and the destruction the Obama Presidency brought to the country. Savage offered several solutions as to how to rebuild the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/23/inside-the-beltway-new-book-from-michael-savage-go/|title=New book from Michael Savage: ‘Government Zero: No Borders, No Language, No Culture’|last=Harper|first=Jennifer|work=The Washington Times|date=September 23, 2015|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Savage released "Scorched Earth: Restoring The Country After Obama". This New York Times best seller was a blueprint for how then candidate Donald Trump could help get the country back on the right track should he win the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadar|first=Anthony J.|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/21/book-review-scorched-earth-restoring-the-country-a/|title=Book Review: 'Scorched Earth: Restoring the Country After Obama'|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Savage released what he said would be his last political book, ''Trump's War: His Battle For America''. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller List.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/27/michael-savage-new-book-trumps-war-hits-no-1-on-ne/|title=Michael Savage new book 'Trump’s War' hits No. 1 on New York Times Best Seller list|last=Harper|first=Jennifer|work=[[The Washington Times]]|access-date=May 10, 2017|date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017 Dr. Savage released a non-political book based on his lifelong quest for spiritual truth titled, "God, Faith, and Reason." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Jennifer|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/13/inside-the-beltway-michael-savage-leaps-into-faith/|title=Inside the Beltway: Michael Savage leaps into faith with new book|work=[[The Washington Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narayan Govind Kalelkar''' ([[Devanagari]]: नारायण गोविंद कालेलकर) (December 11, 1909 - 1989) was a  [[linguist]] from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

He was born in the village of Bambuli in [[Ratnagiri District]]. He received his early college education in [[Baroda]] and [[Mumbai]] with specialization in French language, and a D.Lit. Degree from a university in [[Paris]].

He taught [[French language|French]] and Literature at Baroda Vidyapeeth, and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]/[[Indo-European languages]] at [[Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute|Deccan College]] in [[Pune]].

Kalelkar authored several books on linguistics in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], they being the first of their kind in Marathi. His ''Dhwanivichar'' (ध्वनिविचार) (1955) and ''Bhasha Ani Samskruti'' (भाषा आणि संस्कृति) (1960) received [[Maharashtra]] state's literary prizes; and his  ''Bhasha: Itihas Ani Bhoogol'' (भाषा: इतिहास आणि भूगोल) (1964) received a [[Sahitya Akademi]] award in 1967.

==Contribution to Konkani language==
Kalekar's study of [[Konkani Language|Konkani]] was instrumental in Sahitya Akademi's decision in 1975 to recognize Konkani as an independent Indian language (rather than being a dialect of Marathi).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12056">The '''National Thanksgiving Proclamation''' was the first formal proclamation of [[Thanksgiving]] in the United States. President George Washington declared Thursday, November 26, 1789 as a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.

==Background==
{{Main|Thanksgiving (United States)#History}}
Setting aside time to give thanks for one's blessings, along with holding feasts to celebrate a harvest, are both practices that long predate the European settlement of North America. The first documented thanksgiving services in territory currently belonging to the United States were conducted by Spaniards&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/thanksgiving/# "Thanksgiving"].

Thanksgiving services were routine in what became the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] as early as 1607,&lt;ref&gt;Morill, Ann "Thanksgiving and Other Harvest Festivals" Infobase Publishing, {{ISBN|1-60413-096-2}}&lt;nowiki/&gt;p.33&lt;/ref&gt; with the first permanent settlement of [[Jamestown, Virginia]] holding a thanksgiving in 1610.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1619, the [[Berkeley Hundred]] colony held a service on December 4, 1619, to celebrate “the day of our ship’s arrival” and proclaimed the date would be “yearly and perpetually kept holy as a day of thanksgiving to the Almighty God.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/government-and-civics/essays/history-thanksgiving-holiday|title=A History of the Thanksgiving Holiday {{!}} The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|date=2012-02-29|website=www.gilderlehrman.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colony was wiped out shortly after, in March 1722, with some inhabitants being massacred, and the rest fleeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/38375|title=Jamestown at 400:  Caught Between a Rock and a Slippery Slope|website=historynewsnetwork.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generally referenced 'First Thanksgiving' occurred on [[Plymouth Colony]], shortly after the colonists first successful harvest in autumn of 1621.

==The First Presidential National Day of Thanksgiving==
In Congress, [[Elias Boudinot]] introduced a resolution to create a [[joint committee]] to "wait on the President of the United States, to request that he would recommend to the people a day of public prayer and thanksgiving,"

The resolution was opposed by [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]], who opposed increased power of the central government. Chief among the opposition were [[Aedanus Burke]], and [[Thomas Tudor Tucker]]. Burke was of the opinion that the holiday was too "European." He "did not like this mimicking of European customs, where they made a mere mockery of thanksgivings." Burke was referencing the fact that at thanksgivings, both sides of a war often sang [[Te Deum]], a hymn of praise. He was objecting that both the winners and losers in a war gave thanksgiving. Tucker however, felt that the federal government did not have the power to propose a day of thanksgiving. He was of the opinion that "If a day of thanksgiving must take place, let it be done by the authority of the States." Tucker also worried about the [[separation of church and state]], as in his opinion, proclaiming a day of thanksgiving was a religious matter.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8H_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55|title=Thanksgiving: The Holiday at the Heart of the American Experience|author=Melanie Kirkpatrick|date=11 October 2016|publisher=Encounter Books|isbn=978-1-59403-894-5|pages=55– 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, the resolution passed the House and the Senate, and a committee of Elias Boudinot, [[Roger Sherman]], [[Peter Silvester (1734–1808)|Peter Silvester,]] [[William Samuel Johnson]], and [[Ralph Izard]] delivered the message to Washington on or before September 28, 1789.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick2016" /&gt; President Washington noted that "both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested [him] 'to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanks-giving and prayer.'" It was formally declared on November 26 to "be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gwhtml/gw004.html|title=About this Collection - George Washington Papers|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2017-09-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[George Washington]] made this proclamation on October 3, 1789 in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Archives Celebrate Thanksgiving|url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2013/nr13-22.html|publisher=[[National Archives (United States)|National Archives]]|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/georgewashington/multimedia/arnn/thanksgiving.html "Rediscovering George Washington" PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of thanksgiving, Washington attended services at [[St. Paul's Chapel]] in New York City, and donated beer and food to imprisoned debtors in the city.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/thanksgiving/|title=Thanksgiving|website=George Washington's Mount Vernon|language=en|access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor, and whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me "to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness.

And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions, to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually, to render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed, to protect and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such as have shown kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government, peace, and concord. To promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the encrease of science among them and Us, and generally to grant unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.

==Aftermath==
George Washington proclaimed a second day of Thanksgiving in 1795, following the defeat of the [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. After Washington left office, [[John Adams]], [[James Madison]], and others intermediately declared days of Thanksgiving.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Several presidents opposed days of national thanksgiving, with [[Thomas Jefferson]] openly denouncing such a proclamation.&lt;ref name="Panati2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=utroDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66|title=Panati's Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things|author=Charles Panati|date=15 August 2016|publisher=Book Sales|isbn=978-0-7858-3437-3|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1855, 16 states celebrated Thanksgiving (14 on the fourth Thursday of November, and two on the third). However, it was not until 1863 that [[Abraham Lincoln]] established the regular tradition of observing days of national thanksgiving.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Nukuoro language''' is a [[Polynesian language]], spoken by about 860 people on the [[Nukuoro]] [[atoll]] and on [[Pohnpei]] in [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]].

==Introduction==

===History===
Nukuoro is a coral atoll and [[Polynesia]]n outlier found within the [[Pohnpei District]] within the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. Despite the fact that Nukuoro is a Micronesian atoll, from a typological perspective, Nukuoro is a Polynesian language that descends from the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian node]]. Its most immediate node is the [[Ellicean languages|Elliciean node]]. This language is most closely related to [[Kapingamarangi language|Kapingamarangi]], [[Rennellese language|Rennellese]], and [[Vaeakau-Taumako language|Vaeakau-Taumako]] sporting lexical similarity (Carroll 1965). These languages are not mutually intelligible, but they can make themselves understand each other with a little bit of difficulty. Bilingualism is not a common feature among the Nukuoro people, although the majority of the older Nukuoro population have a considerable amount of knowledge in Ponapean, sometimes know some German, Japanese, English, or another Micronesian language. This second language is usually reserved for the classroom, Bible reading, conversation with visitors, etc.

Nukuoro was colonized multiple times, by Germany, Japan, and then also some by the United States of America in its lifetime. The history that local legend has it says that immigrants from another island first populated Nukuoro. Two canoes from Samoa under the leadership of Chief Ko Wave and his priestly father Teakhu lead this movement (Newton).

===Population===
The primary language spoken on the Nukuoro atoll is Nukuoro. In 1965 there were approximately 400 speakers. 260 of these speakers resided on the atoll, 125 lived on [[Pohnpei|Ponape]], the District Center, and a few others were spread out on the other islands in the District (Carroll 1965). The current population is estimated to be at about 1000 speakers. The Nukuoro people are very dependent on the sea. They have a strong respect for the marine culture, and are very well known for their skillfully created wooden sculptures. These often are carved to represent marine animals.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
There are 5 vowels in Nukuoro: /a, e, i, o, u/. There are also lengthened vowels, for example ‘’taane’’. Double vowels are represented by writing the vowel symbol twice. The phonemic geminate /aa/ is often realized phonetically as [æ]. &lt;ref&gt;Carroll 1965, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===
There are 10 [[consonants]] in Nukuoro.

Like many Polynesian languages, Nukuoro has only three stops in its phonemic inventory: /p/, /t/, and /k/. These stops can be variably voiced, but are phonemically voiceless. The orthography of Nukuoro represents these voiceless stops with ''b, d, g''. The alveolar tap /ɾ/ is represented in Nukuoro orthography using the letter ''l'', although early records of Nukuoro (and in fact, the spelling of the language name itself) use ''r''. 

There are also lengthened consonants, as in the word ''hhano''. Since singleton /p/, /t/, /k/ are written with ''b, d, g'', geminated /p/, /t/, /k/ are written with ''p, t, k''. Geminated /m/, /n/, /s/, /h/, /ɾ/ are represented with double letters (''mm, nn, ss, hh, ll''), and geminated /ŋ/ is written as ''nng''.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, 1965, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Syllable Structure===
Syllables take the shapes V, VV, VVV, CV, CVV and CVVV. All possible V and VV combinations occur. All possible CV combinations occur except /vu/. The first member of a [[diphthong]] is always the syllabic peak when the syllable is stressed; elsewhere there is little difference between members, the peak of sonority tending to occur on the most naturally sonorous vowel (Carroll 1956).

===Phonemes===
In the Nukuoro language, each [[phoneme]] is distinct: “/b/ is an aspirated bilabial stop, /d/ is a lax aspirated dental stop, /g/ is a slightly aspirated of implosive velar stop, /v/ is a very lax labio-dental fricative, /s/ is a tense voiceless alveo-palatal fricative, /h/ is a voiceless velar fricative, /m/ is a voiced bilabial nasal, /n/ is a voiced dental nasal, /ng/ is a voiced velar nasal, /l/ is a voiced dental flap, /i/ is a high front unrounded vowel, /e/ is a mid front unrounded vowel, /a/ us a low or mid central unrounded vowel, /o/ is a mid back rounded vowel, and /u/ is a high back rounded vowel” (Carroll 1965). For double phonemes “stops have increased [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]] especially after pause, and articulation is tense and phones are normally voiceless; nasals and fricatives have tense articulation; flaps are tense, long, with pre-voiced dental stop; and vowels are about twice as long as single vowels and not rearticulated” (Carroll 1965).

==Grammar==

===Basic Word Order===
The basic [[word order]] in Nukuoro is Subject-Object-Verb, but there are also cases of Verb-Subject-Object. 
An example sentence: ''Au ne gidee de gaago'' "I saw the chicken"

===Reduplication===
There are four types of [[reduplication]].
R1 appears in nouns, adjectives, and verbs, while R2, R3 and R4 appear only in adjectives and verbs.
R1 is reduplication of the entire [[base (morpheme)|base]]. So, for example, ''gohu'' "dark" and ''gohugohu'' means "getting dark".
R2 is reduplication of the first syllable of a base.  For example, ''gai'' means "eat" and ''gagai'' means "the fish are biting".
R3 is reduplication of the initial consonant of a base. For example, ''seni'' means "sleep" and ''sseni'' means "to sleep".
R4 is reduplication of the initial vowel of a base. For example, ''malemo'', which is a singular subject, and ''maalemo'', which is plural subject

==Endangerment==

===Materials===
There are few solid resources for the Nukuoro language. The primary and probably most informative one is Vern Carroll's book ''An Outline of the Structure of the Language of Nukuoro''. There is also a Nukuoro Lexicon that has English to Nukuoro and Nukuoro to English, as well as grammar notes.

In 2013, Gregory D.S. Anderson and K. David Harrison of Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages created the [http://talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu/nukuoro/ Nukuoro Talking Dictionary], a digital lexicon that includes sound recordings of Nukuoro words. This lexicon was initially populated with sound recordings from Nukuoro speakers Johnny Rudolph, Maynard Henry, and Kurt Erwin. This dictionary continues to be augmented by speakers and linguists and includes over 1000 audio tokens.

===Vitality===
Nukuoro is listed as a [[wikt:developing|developing]] language. Ethnologue states that this means it is in vigorous use but isn’t yet widespread. It is being transmitted to children, and is used in schools, government, and daily life. After World War 2 ended there were already efforts to help preserve the language as the United States set up an elementary school taught completely in Nukuoro. The population of speakers also increased from 400 to 1000 since 1965, which shows positive growth.

*Because the Ocaina alphabet is based on [[Spanish alphabet|Spanish]], c is used to indicate {{IPA|/k/}} before a, o, and u, qu is used before e and i, and k is used in [[loan word]]s, such as '''kerosene''' ''kerosene''.
*Nasalization is indicated by inserting n after a vowel.  Compare:  '''tya tyója''' {{IPA|[tʲa tʲóha]}} ''hang it'' vs. '''tya tyonjan''' {{IPA|[tʲa tʲṍhã]}} ''clean it''.
*High tone is indicated with the acute accent: á, é, í, ó, ú.

The '''Philipsburg Proclamation''' is a [[historical document]] issued by [[British Army]] General [[Henry Clinton (1730–1795)|Sir Henry Clinton]] on June 30, 1779 intended to encourage [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]] to run away and enlist in the [[British Armed Forces|Royal Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carnahan |first=Burrus M. |authorlink=Burrus M.

The proclamation extended the scope of [[Dunmore's Proclamation]], issued four years earlier by Virginia's last Royal governor, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], granting freedom to [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]] in [[Virginia]] willing to serve the Royal forces. The new document, issued from Clinton's temporary headquarters at the [[Philipsburg Manor House]] in [[Westchester County, New York]], proclaimed all slaves in the newly established [[United States]] belonging to [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American Patriots]] free, regardless of their willingness to fight for the [[British monarchy|Crown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=The Philipsburg Proclamation |url=http://www.blackloyalist.com/canadiandigitalcollection/story/revolution/philipsburg.htm |accessdate=2007-10-07 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117055926/http://www.blackloyalist.com/canadiandigitalcollection/story/revolution/philipsburg.htm |archivedate=2007-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It further promised protection, freedom and land to any slaves who left their [[Slave master|master]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Hilvers |first=Julie |title=Freedom Bound: Black Loyalists |url=http://www.nku.edu/~freedomchronicle/OldSiteArchive/archive/issue4/studentscorner.php |accessdate=2007-10-07 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123113115/http://www.nku.edu/~freedomchronicle/OldSiteArchive/archive/issue4/studentscorner.php |archivedate=November 23, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qudama ibn Ja'far al-Katib al-Baghdadi''' ({{lang-ar|قدامة بن جعفر الكاتب البغدادي}}; ca. 873 – ca. 932/948), also known as '''Abu'l Faraj''', was a [[Assyrian people|Syriac]] scholar and administrator for the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].

==Life==

Little is known with certainty about Qudama's life and work. He was probably born ca. 873/874, possibly at [[Basra]]. His grandfather was a [[Syriac Christian]]. Whether it was his grandfather, or he himself, who converted to [[Islam]] under Muktafi bi-Allah in ca. 902–908 is unclear.{{sfn|Dodge|loc=Vol.1|p=285, n.145}} Ibn al-Nadim described him as a master of literary style, a polished writer and distinguished philosopher of Logic despite having an uneducated father.{{sfn|Dodge|loc=Vol.1|p=285}}
He held various junior administrative positions in the caliphal secretariat in [[Baghdad]], and eventually rose to a senior post the treasury department. Various dates for his death have been supplied, ranging from 932 to 939/940 and 948.&lt;ref&gt;Bonebakker (1986), pp. 318–320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 1766&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Of his several books on philosophy, history, philology, and administration, only three survive:
* the ''Kitab al-Kharaj'' ({{lang|ar|كتاب الخراج}} -the ''Book of the [[kharaj|Land Tax]]'', in full form ''Book of the Land Tax and the Art of the Secretary''), for which Qudama is chiefly known. The last four sections of the original eight{{refn|group=n|Al-Fihrist indicates that Qudama  added a ninth section, however the [[Chester Beatty|Beatty]] [[MS]] contains a marginal note, perhaps a correction; "seven stages to which he added an eighth"{{sfn|Dodge|loc=I|p=285, n.147}}}}, survives.  It was written after 928 as a manual for administrators, and deals with the structure of the state and the army, as well with geographic details, including valuable accounts on the Caliphate's neighbours, especially the [[Byzantine Empire]]. It also included a now lost section on literary rhetoric.&lt;ref name="EI2-320"&gt;Bonebakker (1986), p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 1766–1767&lt;/ref&gt;
* the ''Kitab al-Alfaz'' (''Book of Words'') or ''Jawahir al-Alfaz'' (''Jewels of Words''), a compilation of synonyms and phrases for the use of poets and orators, as well as containing an introduction on the figures of speech.&lt;ref name="EI2-320"/&gt;
* the ''Kitab Naqd al-shi'r'' ({{lang|ar|كتاب نقد الشعر}} -''Book on Poetic Criticism''), an essay and guide on composing good [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonebakker (1986), pp. 320–321&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Cleanser ("Sabun" or "soap")of Sorrow ({{lang|ar|كتاب صابرن الغمّ}})
* Dismissal of Anxiety ({{lang|ar|كتاب جلاء الحزن}})
* Epistle about Abu 'Ali ibn Muqlah known as "The Brilliant Star" ({{lang|ar|كتاب رسالتة في ابى على ابن مقلة ويعرف بالخجم الثاقب}})
* Withstanding Grief ({{lang|ar|كتاب صَرف الهمّ}})
* Wines of Thought ({{lang|ar|كتاب درياق الفكر فيما عاب به أبا تمام}}){{refn|group=n|[[Alfred Chester Beatty|Beatty]] garbled but [[Gustav Leberecht Flügel|Flügel]] and [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yaqut]] give "daryaq" , i.e. [[theriac]] or [[theurgy]]{{sfn|Dodge|loc=I|p-285, n.150}}}}
* Book of Unconciousness ({{lang|ar|كتاب جلاء الحزن}})
* Book of Politics ({{lang|ar|كتاب السياسة}})
* Refutation of [[Ibn al-Mu'tazz]] ({{lang|ar|كتاب الردّ على ابن المعتز}})

'''Saul Aaron Kripke''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɔː|l|_|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|p|k|i}}; born November 13, 1940) is an [[American philosopher]] and [[logician]]. He is a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the [[Graduate Center of the City University of New York]] and emeritus professor at [[Princeton University]]. Since the 1960s, Kripke has been a central figure in a number of fields related to [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[set theory]]. Much of his work remains unpublished or exists only as tape recordings and privately circulated manuscripts. Kripke was the recipient of the 2001 [[Schock Prize]] in Logic and Philosophy.

Kripke has made influential and original contributions to logic, especially [[modal logic]]. His work has profoundly influenced [[analytic philosophy]]; his principal contribution is a semantics for modal logic involving [[possible world]]s, now called [[Kripke semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Fodor, "[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n20/jerry-fodor/waters-water-everywhere Water's water everywhere]", ''London Review of Books'', 21 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Another of his most important contributions is his argument that necessity is a "metaphysical" notion that should be separated from the epistemic notion of ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and that there are [[Logical truth|necessary truths]] that are ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' truths, such as that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. He has also contributed an original reading of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], referred to as "[[Kripkenstein]]." A 1970 Princeton lecture series, published in book form 1980 as ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', is considered one of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century.

==Life and career==
Saul Kripke is the oldest of three children born to [[Dorothy K. Kripke]] and Rabbi [[Myer S. Kripke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kripke|first=Saul|title=Philosophical Troubles: Collected Papers Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-973015-5|pages=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was the leader of Beth El Synagogue, the only Conservative congregation in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]]; his mother wrote educational Jewish books for children. Saul and his two sisters, Madeline and Netta, attended Dundee Grade School and [[Omaha Central High School]]. Kripke was labeled a [[Child prodigy|prodigy]], teaching himself [[Biblical Hebrew|Ancient Hebrew]] by the age of six, reading Shakespeare's complete works by nine, and mastering the works of Descartes and complex mathematical problems before finishing elementary school.&lt;ref name="Charles McGrath"&gt;{{cite news

Saul Kripke (1940–)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his first completeness theorem in [[modal logic]] at 17, and had it published a year later. After graduating from high school in 1958, Kripke attended [[Harvard University]] and graduated [[summa cum laude]] in 1962 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in mathematics. During his sophomore year at Harvard, he taught a graduate-level logic course at nearby [[MIT]]. Upon graduation he received a [[Fulbright Fellowship]], and in 1963 was appointed to the [[Society of Fellows]]. Kripke later said, "I wish I could have skipped college. I got to know some interesting people but I can't say I learned anything. I probably would have learned it all anyway just reading on my own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/28/books/philosopher-65-lectures-not-about-what-am-i-but-what-is-i.html|title=Philosopher, 65, Lectures Not About 'What Am I?' but 'What Is I?'|first=Charles|last=McGrath|date=January 28, 2006|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After briefly teaching at Harvard, in 1968 Kripke moved to [[Rockefeller University]] in New York City, where he taught until 1976. In 1978 he took a chaired professorship at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saul-Kripke|title=Saul Kripke - American logician and philosopher|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he received the university's Behrman Award for distinguished achievement in the humanities. In 2002 Kripke began teaching at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]], and in 2003 he was appointed a distinguished professor of philosophy there.

Kripke has received honorary degrees from the [[University of Nebraska]], Omaha (1977), [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1997), [[University of Haifa]], Israel (1998), and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (2005). He is a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] and an elected Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and in 1985 was a Corresponding Fellow of the [[British Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britac.ac.uk/user/3271{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Rolf Schock Prizes|Schock Prize]] in Logic and Philosophy in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rolfschockprizes.se/en-GB/priset/tidigarepristagare.10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Kripke was married to philosopher [[Margaret Gilbert]]. He is the second cousin once removed of television writer, director, and producer [[Eric Kripke]].

==Work==
[[File:LTL model.png|thumb|185px|right|Example Kripke model for [[linear temporal logic]], a particular modal logic]]
Kripke's contributions to philosophy include:

# [[Kripke semantics]] for [[modal logic|modal and related logics]], published in several essays beginning in his teens.
# His 1970 Princeton lectures ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' (published in 1972 and 1980), which significantly restructured [[philosophy of language]].
# His interpretation of [[Wittgenstein]].
# His theory of [[truth]].

He has also contributed to set theory (see [[admissible ordinal]] and [[Kripke–Platek set theory]]).

===Modal logic===
Two of Kripke's earlier works, ''A Completeness Theorem in Modal Logic'' and ''Semantical Considerations on Modal Logic,'' the former written when he was a teenager, were on [[modal logic]]. The most familiar logics in the modal family are constructed from a weak logic called K, named after Kripke. Kripke introduced the now-standard [[Kripke semantics]] (also known as relational semantics or frame semantics) for modal logics. Kripke semantics is a formal semantics for non-classical logic systems. It was first made for modal logics, and later adapted to [[intuitionistic logic]] and other non-classical systems. The discovery of Kripke semantics was a breakthrough in the making of non-classical logics, because the model theory of such logics was absent before Kripke.

A '''Kripke frame''' or '''modal frame''' is a pair &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''W'' is a non-empty set, and ''R'' is a [[binary relation]] on ''W''. Elements of ''W'' are called ''nodes'' or ''worlds'', and ''R'' is known as the [[accessibility relation]].  Depending on the properties of the accessibility relation ([[Transitive relation|transitivity]], reflexivity, etc.), the corresponding frame is described, by extension, as being transitive, reflexive, etc.

A '''Kripke model''' is a triple &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a Kripke frame, and [[Turnstile (symbol)|&lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt;]] is a relation between nodes of ''W'' and modal formulas, such that:

* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\neg A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\nVdash A&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A\to B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\nVdash A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\Box A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall u\,(w\; R\; u&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A)&lt;/math&gt;.

We read &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; as "''w'' satisfies ''A''", "''A'' is satisfied in ''w''", or "''w'' forces ''A''". The relation &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''satisfaction relation'', ''evaluation'', or ''[[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] relation''. The satisfaction relation is uniquely determined by its value on propositional variables.

A formula ''A'' is '''valid''' in:

* a model &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; for all ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W'',
* a frame &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, if it is valid in &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for all possible choices of &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt;,
* a class ''C'' of frames or models, if it is valid in every member of ''C''.

We define Thm(''C'') to be the set of all formulas that are valid in ''C''. Conversely, if ''X'' is a set of formulas, let Mod(''X'') be the class of all frames which validate every formula from ''X''.

A modal logic (i.e., a set of formulas) ''L'' is '''sound''' with respect to a class of frames ''C'', if ''L''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;Thm(''C''). ''L'' is '''complete''' with respect to ''C'' if ''L''&amp;nbsp;⊇&amp;nbsp;Thm(''C'').

Semantics is useful for investigating a logic (i.e., a derivation system) only if the semantical [[entailment]] relation reflects its syntactical counterpart, the ''consequence'' relation (''derivability''). It is vital to know which modal logics are sound and complete with respect to a class of Kripke frames, and for them, to determine which class it is.

For any class ''C'' of Kripke frames, Thm(''C'') is a [[normal modal logic]] (in particular, theorems of the minimal normal modal logic, ''K'', are valid in every Kripke model). However, the converse does not hold generally. There are Kripke incomplete normal modal logics, which is unproblematic, because most of the modal systems studied are complete of classes of frames described by simple conditions.

A normal modal logic ''L'' '''corresponds''' to a class of frames ''C'', if ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Mod(''L''). In other words, ''C'' is the largest class of frames such that ''L'' is sound wrt ''C''. It follows that ''L'' is Kripke complete if and only if it is complete of its corresponding class.

Consider the schema '''T''' : &lt;math&gt;\Box A\to A&lt;/math&gt;. '''T''' is valid in any [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] frame &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;: if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash \Box A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; since ''w''&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;''w''. On the other hand, a frame which validates '''T''' has to be reflexive: fix ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W'', and define satisfaction of a propositional variable ''p'' as follows: &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''w''&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;''u''. Then &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash \Box p&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt; by '''T''', which means ''w''&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;''w'' using the definition of &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt;. '''T''' corresponds to the class of reflexive Kripke frames.

It is often much easier to characterize the corresponding class of ''L'' than to prove its completeness, thus correspondence serves as a guide to completeness proofs. Correspondence is also used to show ''incompleteness'' of modal logics: suppose ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are normal modal logics that correspond to the same class of frames, but ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; does not prove all theorems of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is Kripke incomplete. For example, the schema &lt;math&gt;\Box(A\equiv\Box A)\to\Box A&lt;/math&gt; generates an incomplete logic, as it corresponds to the same class of frames as '''GL''' (viz. transitive and converse well-founded frames), but does not prove the '''GL'''-[[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] &lt;math&gt;\Box
A\to\Box\Box A&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Canonical models ====

For any normal modal logic ''L'', a Kripke model (called the '''canonical model''') can be constructed, which validates precisely the theorems of ''L'', by an adaptation of the standard technique of using [[maximal consistent set]]s as models. Canonical Kripke models play a role similar to the [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]] construction in algebraic semantics.

A set of formulas is ''L''-''consistent'' if no contradiction can be derived from them using the axioms of ''L'', and [[modus ponens]]. A ''maximal L-consistent set'' (an ''L''-''MCS'' for short) is an ''L''-consistent set which has no proper ''L''-consistent superset.

The '''canonical model''' of ''L'' is a Kripke model &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''W'' is the set of all ''L''-''MCS'', and the relations ''R'' and &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt; are as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;X\;R\;Y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every formula &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\Box A\in X&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A\in Y&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;X\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A\in X&lt;/math&gt;.

The canonical model is a model of ''L'', as every ''L''-''MCS'' contains all theorems of ''L''. By [[Zorn's lemma]], each ''L''-consistent set is contained in an ''L''-''MCS'', in particular every formula unprovable in ''L'' has a counterexample in the canonical model.

The main application of canonical models are completeness proofs. Properties of the canonical model of '''K''' immediately imply completeness of '''K''' with respect to the class of all Kripke frames. This argument does ''not'' work for arbitrary ''L'', because there is no guarantee that the underlying ''frame'' of the canonical model satisfies the frame conditions of ''L''.

We say that a formula or a set ''X'' of formulas is '''canonical''' with respect to a property ''P'' of Kripke frames, if

* ''X'' is valid in every frame which satisfies ''P'',
* for any normal modal logic ''L'' which contains ''X'', the underlying frame of the canonical model of ''L'' satisfies ''P''.

A union of canonical sets of formulas is itself canonical. It follows from the preceding discussion that any logic axiomatized by a canonical set of formulas is Kripke complete, and [[compactness theorem|compact]].

The axioms T, 4, D, B, 5, H, G (and thus any combination of them) are canonical. GL and Grz are not canonical, because they are not compact. The axiom M by itself is not canonical (Goldblatt, 1991), but the combined logic '''S4.1''' (in fact, even '''K4.1''') is canonical.

In general, it is [[decision problem|undecidable]] whether a given axiom is canonical. We know a nice sufficient condition: H. Sahlqvist identified a broad class of formulas (now called [[Sahlqvist formula]]s) such that:

* a Sahlqvist formula is canonical,
* the class of frames corresponding to a Sahlqvist formula is [[first-order logic|first-order]] definable,
* there is an algorithm which computes the corresponding frame condition to a given Sahlqvist formula.

This is a powerful criterion: for example, all axioms listed above as canonical are (equivalent to) Sahlqvist formulas. A logic has the [[finite model property]] (FMP) if it is complete with respect to a class of finite frames. An application of this notion is the decidability question: it follows from Post's theorem that a recursively axiomatized modal logic L which has FMP is decidable, provided it is decidable whether a given finite frame is a model of L. In particular, every finitely axiomatizable logic with FMP is decidable.

There are various methods for establishing FMP for a given logic. Refinements and extensions of the canonical model construction often work, using tools such as filtration or unravelling. As another possibility, completeness proofs based on cut-free sequent calculi usually produce finite models directly.

Most of the modal systems used in practice (including all listed above) have FMP.

In some cases, we can use FMP to prove Kripke completeness of a logic: every normal modal logic is complete wrt a class of modal algebras, and a finite modal algebra can be transformed into a Kripke frame. As an example, Robert Bull proved using this method that every normal extension of S4.3 has FMP, and is Kripke complete.

Kripke semantics has a straightforward generalization to logics with more than one modality. A Kripke frame for a language with
&lt;math&gt;\{\Box_i\mid\,i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; as the set of its necessity operators consists of a non-empty set ''W'' equipped with binary relations ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I''. The definition of a satisfaction relation is modified as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\Box_i A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall u\,(w\;R_i\;u\Rightarrow u\Vdash A).&lt;/math&gt;

==== Carlson models ====

A simplified semantics, discovered by Tim Carlson, is often used for polymodal [[provability logic]]s. A '''Carlson model''' is a structure &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\{D_i\}_{i\in I},\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt; with a single accessibility relation ''R'', and subsets ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''W'' for each modality. Satisfaction is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\Box_i A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall u\in D_i\,(w\;R\;u\Rightarrow u\Vdash A).&lt;/math&gt;

Carlson models are easier to visualize and to work with than usual polymodal Kripke models; there are, however, Kripke complete polymodal logics which are Carlson incomplete.

In ''Semantical Considerations on Modal Logic'', published in 1963, Kripke responded to a difficulty with classical [[quantification theory]]. The motivation for the world-relative approach was to represent the possibility that objects in one world may fail to exist in another. If standard quantifier rules are used, however, every term must refer to something that exists in all the possible worlds. This seems incompatible with our ordinary practice of using terms to refer to things that exist contingently.

Kripke's response to this difficulty was to eliminate terms. He gave an example of a system that uses the world-relative interpretation and preserves the classical rules. However, the costs are severe. First, his language is artificially impoverished, and second, the rules for the propositional modal logic must be weakened.

Kripke's possible worlds theory has been used by narratologists (beginning with Pavel and Dolezel) to understand "reader's manipulation of alternative plot developments, or the characters' planned or fantasized alternative action series." This application has become especially useful in the analysis of [[hyperfiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Fludernik, Monika. "Histories of Narrative Theory: From Structuralism to Present." ''A Companion to Narrative Theory.'' Ed. Phelan and Rabinowitz. Blackwell Publishing, MA:2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intuitionistic logic===
Kripke semantics for [[intuitionistic logic]] follows the same principles as the semantics of modal logic, but uses a different definition of satisfaction.

An '''intuitionistic Kripke model''' is a triple
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,\le,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\langle W,\le\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partially ordered set|partially ordered]] Kripke frame, and &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following conditions:
* if ''p'' is a propositional variable, &lt;math&gt;w\le u&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt; (''persistency'' condition),
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A\land B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A\lor B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A\to B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;u\ge w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash B&lt;/math&gt;,
* not &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\bot&lt;/math&gt;.

Intuitionistic logic is sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics, and it has the Finite Model Property.

'''Intuitionistic first-order logic'''

Let ''L'' be a [[first-order logic|first-order]] language. A Kripke model of ''L'' is a triple
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,\le,\{M_w\}_{w\in W}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,\le\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is an intuitionistic Kripke frame, ''M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a
(classical) ''L''-structure for each node ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W'', and the following compatibility conditions hold whenever ''u''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''v'':
* the domain of ''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' is included in the domain of ''M&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'',
* realizations of function symbols in ''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' agree on elements of ''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'',
* for each ''n''-ary predicate ''P'' and elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'': if ''P''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') holds in ''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'', then it holds in ''M&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''.
Given an evaluation ''e'' of variables by elements of ''M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'', we define the satisfaction relation &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A[e]&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash P(t_1,\dots,t_n)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;P(t_1[e],\dots,t_n[e])&lt;/math&gt; holds in ''M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'',
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(A\land B)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A[e]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B[e]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(A\lor B)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A[e]&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B[e]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(A\to B)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;u\ge w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A[e]&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash B[e]&lt;/math&gt;,
* not &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\bot[e]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(\exists x\,A)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists an &lt;math&gt;a\in M_w&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A[e(x\to a)]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(\forall x\,A)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every &lt;math&gt;u\ge w&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;a\in M_u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A[e(x\to a)]&lt;/math&gt;.
Here ''e''(''x''→''a'') is the evaluation which gives ''x'' the value ''a'', and otherwise agrees with ''e''.

===''Naming and Necessity''===

{{main|Naming and Necessity}}
[[File:Naming and Necessity.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' ]]
The three lectures that form ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' constitute an attack on [[descriptivist theory of names]]. Kripke attributes variants of descriptivist theories to [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and [[John Searle]], among others. According to descriptivist theories, proper names either are synonymous with descriptions, or have their reference determined by virtue of the name's being associated with a description or cluster of descriptions that an object uniquely satisfies. Kripke rejects both these kinds of descriptivism. He gives several examples purporting to render [[Descriptivist theory of names|descriptivism]] implausible as a theory of how names get their references determined (e.g., surely [[Aristotle]] could have died at age two and so not satisfied any of the descriptions we associate with his name, but it would seem wrong to deny that he was still Aristotle).

As an alternative, Kripke outlined a [[Causal theory of names|causal theory of reference]], according to which a name refers to an object by virtue of a causal connection with the object as mediated through communities of speakers. He points out that proper names, in contrast to most descriptions, are [[rigid designation|rigid designators]]: that is, a proper name refers to the named object in every [[possible worlds|possible world]] in which the object exists, while most descriptions designate different objects in different possible worlds. For example, "Richard Nixon" refers to the same person in every possible world in which Nixon exists, while "the person who won the [[United States presidential election, 1968|United States presidential election of 1968"]] could refer to [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], Humphrey, or others in different possible worlds.

Kripke also raised the prospect of ''[[A Posteriori Necessity|a posteriori necessities]]'' — facts that are [[necessarily true]], though they can be known only through empirical investigation. Examples include "[[Hesperus]] is [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]", "[[Cicero]] is [[Cicero|Tully]]", "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" and other identity claims where two names refer to the same object.

Finally, Kripke gave an argument against [[physicalism|identity materialism]] in the [[philosophy of mind]], the view that every mental particular is identical with some physical particular. Kripke argued that the only way to defend this identity is as an ''a posteriori'' necessary identity, but that such an identity — e.g., that pain is [[C fiber|C-fibers]] firing — could not be necessary, given the (clearly conceivable) possibility that pain could be separate from the firing of C-fibers, or the firing of C-fibers be separate from pain. (Similar arguments have since been made by [[David Chalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, David. 1996. ''The Conscious Mind.'' [[Oxford University Press]] pp. 146–9.&lt;/ref&gt;) In any event, the psychophysical identity theorist, according to Kripke, incurs a dialectical obligation to explain the apparent logical possibility of these circumstances, since according to such theorists they should be impossible.

Kripke delivered the [[John Locke lectures]] in philosophy at [[Oxford]] in 1973. Titled ''Reference and Existence'', they are in many respects a continuation of ''Naming and Necessity'', and deal with the subjects of fictional names and perceptual error. They were recently published by Oxford University Press.

In a 1995 paper, philosopher [[Quentin Smith]] argued that key concepts in Kripke's new theory of reference originated in the work of [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]] more than a decade earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smith |first=Quentin |date=2 August 2001 | title=Marcus, Kripke, and the Origin of the New Theory of Reference |journal=Synthese |volume= 104 |issue= 2 |pages=179–189 | url=http://www.qsmithwmu.com/marcus,_kripke,_and_the_origin_of_the_new_theory_of_reference.htm | archive-url=https://archive.is/20060507144448/http://www.qsmithwmu.com/marcus,_kripke,_and_the_origin_of_the_new_theory_of_reference.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=2007-05-28 | doi=10.1007/BF01063869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith identified six significant ideas in the New Theory that he claimed Marcus had developed: (1) that proper names are direct references that do not consist of contained definitions; (2) that while one can single out a single thing by a description, this description is not equivalent to a proper name of this thing; (3) the modal argument that proper names are directly referential, and not disguised descriptions; (4) a formal modal logic proof of the necessity of identity; (5) the concept of a [[rigid designator]], though Kripke coined that term; and (6) ''a posteriori'' identity. Smith argued that Kripke failed to understand Marcus's theory at the time but later adopted many of its key conceptual themes in his New Theory of Reference.

Other scholars have subsequently offered detailed responses arguing that no plagiarism occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://web.gc.cuny.edu/Philosophy/faculty/neale/papers/NealeKripke.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714235537/http://web.gc.cuny.edu/Philosophy/faculty/neale/papers/NealeKripke.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2010 | author=[[Stephen Neale]] |title=No Plagiarism Here | journal=[[Times Literary Supplement]] | pages=12–13 | date = 9 February 2001 | accessdate = 2009-11-13 |format =.PDF |doi=10.1007/BF01063869 |volume=104 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Burgess, "Marcus, Kripke, and Names" ''Philosophical Studies'', 84: 1, pp. 1–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="A Puzzle about Belief"====
Kripke's main propositions about proper names in ''Naming and Necessity'' are that the meaning of a name simply is the object it refers to and that a name's referent is determined by a causal link between some sort of "baptism" and the utterance of the name. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the possibility that propositions containing names may have some additional semantic properties,&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, 1980, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; properties that could explain why two names referring to the same person may give different [[truth value]]s in propositions about beliefs. For example, Lois Lane believes that Superman can fly, although she does not believe that Clark Kent can fly. This can be accounted for if the names "Superman" and "Clark Kent", though referring to the same person, have distinct semantic properties.

But in his article "A Puzzle about Belief" Kripke seems to oppose even this possibility. His argument can be reconstructed as follows: The idea that two names referring to the same object may have different semantic properties is supposed to explain that [[Coreference|coreferring]] names behave differently in propositions about beliefs (as in Lois Lane's case). But the same phenomenon occurs even with coreferring names that obviously have the same semantic properties: Kripke invites us to imagine a French, monolingual boy, Pierre, who believes that "''Londres est joli''" ("London is beautiful"). Pierre moves to London without realizing that London = Londres. He then learns English the same way a child would learn the language, that is, not by translating words from French to English. Pierre learns the name "London" from the unattractive part of the city where he lives, and so comes to believe that London is not beautiful. If Kripke's account is correct, Pierre now believes both that ''Londres'' is ''joli'' and that London is not beautiful. This cannot be explained by coreferring names having different semantic properties. According to Kripke, this demonstrates that attributing additional semantic properties to names does not explain what it is intended to.

===Wittgenstein===
{{more citations needed|date=August 2017}}
First published in 1982, Kripke's ''[[Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language]]'' contends that the central argument of [[Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' centers on a devastating [[rule-following paradox]] that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language.  Kripke writes that this paradox is "the most radical and original skeptical problem that philosophy has seen to date", and that Wittgenstein does not reject the argument that leads to the rule-following paradox, but accepts it and offers a "skeptical solution" to ameliorate the paradox's destructive effects.

Most commentators accept that ''Philosophical Investigations'' contains the rule-following paradox as Kripke presents it, but few have agreed with his attributing a skeptical solution to Wittgenstein. It should be noted that Kripke himself expresses doubts in ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language'' as to whether Wittgenstein would endorse his interpretation of ''Philosophical Investigations.'' He says that the work should not be read as an attempt to give an accurate statement of Wittgenstein's views, but rather as an account of Wittgenstein's argument "as it struck Kripke, as it presented a problem for him".

The portmanteau "Kripkenstein" has been coined for Kripke's interpretation of ''Philosophical Investigations''. Kripkenstein's main significance was a clear statement of a new kind of skepticism, dubbed "meaning skepticism": the idea that for an isolated individual there is no fact in virtue of which he/she means one thing rather than another by the use of a word. Kripke's "skeptical solution" to meaning skepticism is to ground meaning in the behavior of a community.

Kripke's book generated a large secondary literature, divided between those who find his skeptical problem interesting and perceptive, and others, such as [[Gordon Baker]] and [[Peter Hacker]], who argue that his meaning skepticism is a pseudo-problem that stems from a confused, selective reading of Wittgenstein. Kripke's position has been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher [[Martin Kusch]], and Wittgenstein scholar David G. Stern considers Kripke's book "the most influential and widely discussed" work on Wittgenstein since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David G. 2006.  Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations: An Introduction.  Cambridge University Press. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Truth===
In his 1975 article "Outline of a Theory of Truth", Kripke showed that a language can consistently contain its own [[truth]] predicate, something deemed impossible by [[Alfred Tarski]], a pioneer in formal theories of truth. The approach involves letting truth be a partially defined property over the set of grammatically well-formed sentences in the language. Kripke showed how to do this recursively by starting from the set of expressions in a language that do not contain the truth predicate, and defining a truth predicate over just that segment: this action adds new sentences to the language, and truth is in turn defined for all of them. Unlike Tarski's approach, however, Kripke's lets "truth" be the union of all of these definition-stages; after a denumerable infinity of steps the language reaches a "fixed point" such that using Kripke's method to expand the truth-predicate does not change the language any further. Such a fixed point can then be taken as the basic form of a natural language containing its own truth predicate. But this predicate is undefined for any sentences that do not, so to speak, "bottom out" in simpler sentences not containing a truth predicate. That is, " 'Snow is white' is true" is well-defined, as is " ' "Snow is white" is true' is true," and so forth, but neither "This sentence is true" nor "This sentence is not true" receive truth-conditions; they are, in Kripke's terms, "ungrounded."
[[File:Saul Kripke's Gödel lecture at UCSB.jpg|thumb|227x227px|Saul Kripke gives a lecture about [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].]]
Nevertheless, it has been shown by [[Proof sketch for Gödel's first incompleteness theorem|Gödel]] that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects (such as integers) can have an informal self-referential meaning, and this idea – manifested by the [[diagonal lemma]] – is the basis for [[Tarski's undefinability theorem|Tarski's theorem]] that truth cannot be consistently defined. It has thus been claimed&lt;ref&gt;Keith Simmons, ''Universality and the Liar: An Essay on Truth and the Diagonal Argument'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1993&lt;/ref&gt; that Kripke's suggestion does lead to contradiction: while its truth predicate is only partial, it does give truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent. There is still a debate about whether Tarski's proof can be implemented to every variation of such a partial truth system, but none has been shown to be consistent by [[Consistency proof|acceptable proving methods]] used in [[mathematical logic]].

Kripke's proposal is also problematic in the sense that while the language contains a "truth" predicate of itself (at least a partial one), some of its sentences – such as the liar sentence ("this sentence is false") – have an undefined truth value, but the language does not contain its own "undefined" predicate. In fact it cannot, as that would create a new version of the [[liar paradox]], called the ''strengthened liar paradox'' ("this sentence is false or undefined"). Thus while the liar sentence is undefined in the language, the language cannot express that it is undefined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/self-reference/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Thomas|last=Bolander|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=30 May 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tupi–Guarani''' ({{Audio|Br-TupiGuarani.ogg|pronunciation}}) is the name of the most widely distributed subfamily of the [[Tupian languages]] of [[South America]]. It includes fifty languages, including the best-known languages of the family, [[Guarani language|Guarani]] and [[Old Tupi]].

The words ''[[petunia]], [[jaguar]], [[piranha]], [[ipecac]], [[tapioca]], [[jacaranda]], [[anhinga]], [[carioca]]'', and ''[[capoeira]]'' are of Tupi–Guarani origin.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a serious claim to make, as it implies that the Guarani Languages have contributed to major cultural aspects of Brazil. There must be a source of this information|date=April 2018}}

==Classification==
===Rodrigues &amp; Cabral (2012)===
Rodrigues &amp; Cabral (2012) propose eight branches of Tupí–Guaraní:

*'''[[Guaraní languages|Guaraní]]''' (Group I)
*'''Guarayu''' (Group II): [[Guarayu language|Guarayu]], [[Pauserna language|Pauserna]],** [[Sirionó language|Sirionó]] (dialects Yuqui, Jorá**)
*'''Tupí''' (Group III): [[Tupi language|Old Tupi]] (lingua franca dialect [[Tupí Austral]]), Tupinambá (dialects [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]], {{Sc|aka}} [[Língua Geral]] as lingua franca, and [[Potiguara language|Potiguára]]), [[Cocama language|Cocama]]–[[Omagua language|Omagua]]*, [[Tupiniquim language|Tupinikin]]**
*'''Tenetehara''' (Group IV): [[Akwáwa language|Akwáwa]] (dialects Asuriní, Suruí do Pará, Parakanã), [[Avá-Canoeiro language|Avá-Canoeiro]], [[Tapirapé language|Tapirapé]], [[Tenetehára language|Tenetehára]] (dialects [[Guajajara]], Tembé), [[Turiwára language|Turiwára]]
*'''Kawahib''' (Group VI): [[Apiacá language|Apiacá]], [[Kawahíb language|Kawahíb]] (numerous varieties; incl. Piripkúra, Diagói?), [[Kayabí language|Kayabí]], [[Kawahib language|Karipúna]], ?[[Uru-Pa-In language|Uru-Pa-In]]
*'''''[[Kamayurá language|Kamayurá]]''''' (Group VII)
*'''Xingu''' (Group VIIIa): [[Anambé language|Anambé]] (of Cairarí), [[Amanayé language|Amanayé]], [[Xingú Asuriní language|Xingú Asuriní]], [[Araweté language|Araweté]], [[Aurá language|Aurá]], [[Ararandewara language|Ararandewara]]
*'''Northern''' (Group VIIIb): [[Anambé of Ehrenreich]], [[Emerillon language|Emerillon]], [[Guajá language|Guajá]], [[Wayampi language|Wayampi]], [[Zo'é language|Zo'é]], [[Takunyapé language|Takunyapé]], [[Kaapor language|Urubú–Kaapor]], [[Wayampipukú language|Wayampipukú]]

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Cabral argues that Kokama/Omagua is a [[mixed language]], and so not directly classifiable, though most of its basic vocabulary is Tupi–Guarani.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;Not listed in Rodrigues &amp; Cabral

[[Karipuna language (Amapá)]] may be spurious.

===Michael, et al. (2015)===
Michael, et al. (2015) propose the following classification for the Tupi-Guarani languages.
;Tupí-Guaraní
*[[Kamayurá language|Kamaiurá]]
*'''Nuclear Tupí-Guaraní'''
**(branch)

In [[printing]], '''under color removal''' ('''UCR''') is a process of eliminating overlapping [[yellow]], [[magenta]], and [[cyan]] that would have added to a dark neutral (black) and replacing them with [[black]] ink only, called a ''Full Black'', during the [[color separation]] process. Under color removal is used in four-color (or more colors) printing. Black ink used to add details and darkness in shadowed areas is called a ''Skeletal Black''.

With current{{as of?|date=October 2012}} ink technology, the total CMYK ink in the shadows refuses to stick after it reaches the dark shadows (usually above a 250% total CMYK coverage), and begins to peel off. To prevent this, printers developed UCR, in which neutral shadows&amp;nbsp;– which would have normally been produced by overprinting the four inks ''Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black'' on top of each other (high ink coverage)&amp;nbsp;– are replaced with the single layer of ''Black''. UCR removes the color inks ''under'' the Black, resulting in a single layer of ink which sticks to the sheet better, and saves on the consumption of ink.

There is no universal rule for UCR. The amount required will depend on the printing press, paper, and ink in use. 

:Advantages: Solves the ink not sticking problem and;
:Advantages: Black ink is cheaper.
:Possible disadvantages: Black ink by itself in a shadow may not be dark enough, so CMY colors are added (called [[under color addition]] or UCA) to make a more accurate reproduction.

UCR is generally not recommended for use in printing, due to its tendency to produce dull-looking images and artwork. (The problem of "looking dull" can often be obviated on [[coated paper]] by use of an aqueous coating or UV coating applied on the press or as post-press. A press-applied coating can also eliminate the "ink sticking" problem.) The main exception to this rule is that where working in [[newsprint]], UCR is the best way to avoid the associated ink limit and registration issues. UCR is also recommended for some specific paper stocks, depending on the coloration and texture of the paper.

[[Image:HeiligenstadtFachwerk.JPG|thumb|Wattle and daub in wooden frames]]
'''Wattle and daub''' is a [[composite material|composite]] [[building material]] used for making walls, in which a woven lattice of wooden strips called ''[[wattle (construction)|wattle]]'' is ''daubed'' with a sticky material usually made of some combination of wet [[soil]], [[clay]], [[sand]], [[Feces|animal dung]] and straw.  Wattle and daub has been used for at least 6,000 years and is still an important construction material in many parts of the world. Many historic buildings include wattle and daub construction, and the technique is becoming popular again in more developed areas as a low-impact [[sustainable building]] technique.

==Construction==
[[Image:Wattle hurdle under construction.JPG|right|175px|thumb|Wattle in construction]]
The [[wattle (construction)|wattle]] is made by weaving thin branches (either whole, or more usually split) or slats between upright stakes.  The wattle may be made as loose panels, slotted between [[timber framing]] to make infill panels, or made in place to form the whole of a wall. In different regions, the material of wattle can be different. For example, in [[Mitchell Site]] on the northern outskirts of the city of Mitchell, South Dakota, willow has been found as the wattle material of the walls of the house.{{sfn|Alex|1973}} Reeds and vines can also be used as wattle material.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M.. "Dictionary of architecture and construction, fourth edition." 2006 [https://www.pdfdrive.net/dictionary-of-architecture-and-construction-e8247264.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Edward, &amp; Iano, Joseph. "Fundamentals of building construction: materials &amp; methods, fifth edition"&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the term ''wattle'' describing a group of [[acacia]]s in Australia, is derived from the common use of acacias as wattle in early Australian European settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib9596/96cib1 |title=Australia's Wattle Day – Parliament of Australia |website=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daub is usually created from a mixture of ingredients from three categories: [[Binder (material)|binder]]s, [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]s and reinforcement.  Binders hold the mix together and can include clay, [[Lime (material)|lime]], chalk dust and [[limestone]] dust.  Aggregates give the mix its bulk and dimensional stability through materials such as earth, sand, crushed chalk and crushed stone.  Reinforcement is provided by straw, hair, hay or other fibrous materials, and helps to hold the mix together as well as to control shrinkage and provide flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchett, Ian.  ''The Building Conservation Directory'', 2001: "Wattle and Daub". [http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/wattleanddaub Accessed 2 February 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  The daub may be mixed by hand, or by treading &amp;ndash; either by humans or [[livestock]].  It is then applied to the wattle and allowed to dry, and often then [[whitewash]]ed to increase its resistance to rain. Sometimes there can be more than one layer of daub. Still in Mitchell Site, the anterior of the house had double layers of burned daub. {{sfn|Alex|1973|page=151}}

This process has been replaced in modern [[architecture]] by [[lath and plaster]], a common building material for wall and ceiling surfaces, in which a series of nailed wooden strips are covered with [[plaster]] smoothed into a flat surface. In many regions this building method has itself been overtaken by [[drywall]] construction using [[plasterboard]] sheets.

==History==
[[Image:Spiro wattleanddaub HRoe 2005.jpg|right|175px|thumb|A wattle and daub house as used by Native Americans during the Mississippian period]]

The wattle and daub technique was used already in the [[Neolithic]] period. It was common for houses of a [[Linear pottery culture|Linear pottery]] and [[Rössen]] cultures of Central Europe, but is also found in Western Asia ([[Çatalhöyük]], [[Shillourokambos]]) as well as in North America ([[Mississippian culture]]) and South America ([[Brazil]]). In Africa it is common in the architecture of traditional houses such as those of the [[Ashanti people]]. Its usage dates back at least 6000 years. There are suggestions that construction techniques such as [[lath and plaster]] and even [[cob (material)|cob]] may have evolved from wattle and daub. Fragments from prehistoric wattle and daub buildings have been found in Africa, Europe, Mesoamerica and North America.&lt;ref name=Shaffer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shaffer |first=Gary D. |title=An Archaeomagnetic Study of a Wattle and Daub Building Collapse |journal=Journal of Field Archaeology |volume=20 |number=1 |date=Spring 1993 |pages=59–75 |jstor=530354}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of English architecture especially reveals that the sophistication of this craft is dependent on the various styles of timber frame housing.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;Graham, A.H.D. "Wattle and Daub: Craft, Conservation and Wiltshire Case Study" (Dissertation), 2004. [http://www.tonygraham.co.uk/conservation_articles.htm Accessed 26 October 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles of infill panels==
As discussed earlier, there were two popular choices for wattle and daub infill paneling: close-studded paneling and square paneling.

===Close-studding===
[[Close studding|Close-studding]] panels create a much more narrow space between the timbers: anywhere from 7 to 16 inches (18 to 40 cm). For this style of panel, weaving is too difficult, so the wattles run horizontally and are known as ledgers. The ledgers are sprung into each upright timber (stud) through a system of augered holes on one side and short chiseled grooves along the other. The holes (along with holes of square paneling) are drilled at a slight angle towards the outer face of each stud. This allows room for upright hazels to be tied to ledgers from the inside of the building. The horizontal ledgers are placed every two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 metres) with whole hazel rods positioned upright top to bottom and lashed to the ledgers. These hazel rods are generally tied a finger widths apart with 6–8 rods each with a 16-inch (40 cm) width. Gaps allow key{{clarifyme|date=December 2012}} formation for drying.&lt;ref&gt;Sunshine, Paula. ''Wattle and Daub''.  Buckinghamshire: Shire Publications Ltd 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Square panels===
[[Image:Wattle hurdle.JPG|right|175px|thumb|Wattle panel]]
Square panels are large, wide panels typical of some later timber frame houses. These panels may be square in shape, or sometimes triangular to accommodate arched or decorative bracing. This style does require wattles to be woven for better support of the daub.

To insert wattles in a square panel several steps are required. First, a series of evenly spaced holes are drilled along the middle of the inner face of each upper timber. Next, a continuous groove is cut along the middle of each inner face of the lower timber in each panel. Vertical slender timbers, known as staves, are then inserted and these hold the whole panel within the timber frame. The staves are positioned into the holes and then sprung into the grooves. They must be placed with sufficient gaps to weave the flexible horizontal wattles.

==Applications==
In some places or cultures, the technique of wattle and daub were used with different materials thus has different names, including pug and pine, mud and stud (stud and mud), hourdis, rab (rad) and dab, pierrotage/bousillage (bouzillage) and columage. Bajarreque and jacal are examples of structure built with the technique of wattle and daub.
===Pug and pine===
In the early days of the colonisation of [[South Australia]], in areas where substantial timber was unavailable, pioneers' cottages and other small buildings were frequently constructed with light vertical timbers, which may have been "native pine" (''[[Callitris]]'' or ''[[Casuarina]]'' [[species|spp.]]), driven into the ground, the gaps being stopped with ''pug'' (kneaded clay and grass mixture). Another term for this construction is ''palisade and pug''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mileslewis.net/australian-building/pdf/04-hybrid-types/hybrid-types-palisade-pug.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112040417/http://mileslewis.net/australian-building/pdf/04-hybrid-types/hybrid-types-palisade-pug.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mud and stud===
[[File:Mud &amp; Stud (geograph 3651844).jpg|thumb|A mud and stud wall in [[Tumby Woodside]], Lincolnshire]]
"Mud and stud" is a similar process to wattle and daub, with a simple frame consisting only of upright studs joined by cross rails at the tops and bottoms. Thin staves of ash were attached, then daubed with a mixture of mud, straw, hair and dung. The style of building was once common in [[Lincolnshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wZvjPhec6M8C&amp;pg=PT376|title=Villages of Britain: The Five Hundred Villages that Made the Countryside|first=Clive|last=Aslet|date=15 August 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pierrotage, columage ===
[[Pierrotage]] is the infilling material used in French Vernacular architecture of the Southern United States to infill between half-timbering with diagonal braces, which is similar with daub. It is usually made of lime mortar clay mixed with small stones. It is also called bousillage or bouzillage, especially in French Vernacular architecture of Louisiana of the early 1700s. The materials of bousillage are Spanish moss or clay and grass. Bousillage also refers to the type of brick molded with the same materials and used as infilling between posts. Columbage refers to the timber-framed construction with diagonal bracing of the framework. Pierratage or bousillage is the material filled into the structural timbers.&lt;ref&gt; Harris 2006, p. 231, p. 725.  &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Durand Cabin- poteaux-sur-solle &amp; pierrotage.jpg|thumb|Example of [[pierrotage]] construction in [[Ste. Geneviève, Missouri]].]]
===Bajarreque===
Bajarreque is a wall constructed with the technique of wattle and daub. The wattle here is made of [[bagasse]], and the daub is the mix of clay and straw.&lt;ref&gt; Harris 2006, p. 77. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacal===
[[Jacal]] can refer to a type of crude house whose wall is built with wattle and daub in southwestern America. Closely spaced upright sticks or poles driven into the ground with small branches (wattle) interwoven between them make the structural frame of the wall. Mud or an adobe clay (daub) is covered outside. To provide additional weather protection, the wall is usually plastered.&lt;ref&gt; Harris 2006, p. 551. &lt;/ref&gt;
