'''Adjustable speed drive''' (ASD) or '''variable-speed drive''' (VSD) describes equipment used to control the speed of machinery. Many industrial processes such as assembly lines must operate at different speeds for different products.  Where process conditions demand adjustment of flow from a pump or fan, varying the speed of the drive may save energy compared with other techniques for flow control.

Where speeds may be selected from several different pre-set ranges, usually the drive is said to be adjustable speed. If the output speed can be changed without steps over a range, the drive is usually referred to as ''variable speed''.

Adjustable and variable speed drives may be purely mechanical (termed ''[[variator]]s''), electromechanical, hydraulic, or electronic.

==Electric motors ==
{{see also|Induction motor|synchronous machine}}
AC electric motors can be run in fixed-speed operation determined by the number of stator pole pairs in the motor and the [[utility frequency|frequency]] of the alternating current supply. AC motors can be made for "pole changing" operation, reconnecting the stator winding to vary the number of poles so that two, sometimes three, speeds are obtained.  For example a machine with 8 physical pairs of poles, could be connected to allow running with either 4 or 8 pole pairs,  giving two speeds - at 60 Hz, these would be 1800 RPM and 900 RPM. If speed changes are rare, the motor may be initially connected for one speed then re-wired for the other speed as process conditions change, or, magnetic contactors can be used to switch between the two speeds as process needs fluctuate.  Connections for more than three speeds are uneconomic.

The number of such fixed-speed-operation speeds is constrained by cost as number of pole pairs increases.  If many different speeds or continuously variable speeds are required, other methods are required.

Direct-current motors allow for changes of speed by adjusting the shunt field current.  Another way of changing speed of a direct current motor is to change the voltage applied to the armature.

An adjustable speed drive might consist of an electric motor and [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] that is used to adjust the motor's operating speed. The combination of a constant-speed motor and a continuously adjustable mechanical speed-changing device might also be called an adjustable speed drive. Power electronics based variable frequency drives are rapidly making older technology redundant.

==Reasons for using adjustable speed drives==
[[Process control]] and [[energy conservation]] are the two primary reasons for using an adjustable speed drive. Historically, adjustable speed drives were developed for process control, but energy conservation has emerged as an equally important objective.

===Acceleration control===
[[Image:Fan Pump and Motors.jpg|thumb|right]]
An adjustable speed drive can often provide smoother operation compared to an alternative fixed speed mode of operation. For example, in a sewage lift station sewage usually flows through sewer pipes under the force of gravity to a wet well location. From there it is pumped up to a treatment process. When fixed speed pumps are used, the pumps are set to start when the level of the liquid in the wet well reaches some high point and stop when the level has been reduced to a low point. Cycling the pumps on and off results in frequent high surges of electric current to start the motors that results in electromagnetic and thermal stresses in the motors and power control equipment, the pumps and pipes are subjected to mechanical and hydraulic stresses, and the sewage treatment process is forced to accommodate surges in the flow of sewage through the process. When adjustable speed drives are used, the pumps operate continuously at a speed that increases as the wet well level increases. This matches the outflow to the average inflow and provides a much smoother operation of the process.

===Saving energy by using efficient adjustable speed drives===
Fans and pumps consume a large part of the energy used by industrial electrical motors. Where fans and pumps serve a varying process load, a simple way to vary the delivered quantity of fluid is with a damper or valve in the outlet of the fan or pump, which by its increased pressure drop, reduces the flow in the process. However, this additional pressure drop represents energy loss. Sometimes it is economically practical to put in some device that recovers this otherwise lost energy. With a variable speed drive on the pump or fan, the supply can be adjusted to match demand and no extra loss is introduced. 

For example, when a fan is driven directly by a fixed-speed motor, the airflow is designed for the maximum demand of the system, and so will usually be higher than it needs to be. Airflow can be regulated using a [[damper (architecture)|damper]] but it is more efficient to directly regulate fan motor speed. Following the [[affinity laws]], for 50% of the airflow, the variable-speed motor consumes about 20% of the input power (Amps).  The fixed-speed motor still consumes about 85% of the input power at half the flow.

==Types of adjustable speed drives==
Some prime movers ([[internal combustion engine]]s, reciprocating or turbine steam engines, water wheels, and others) have a range of operating speeds which can be varied continuously (by adjusting fuel rate or similar means). However, efficiency may be low at extremes of the speed range, and there may be system reasons why the prime mover speed cannot be maintained at very low or very high speeds. 

Before electric motors were invented, mechanical speed changers were used to control the mechanical power provided by water wheels and steam engines. When electric motors came into use, means of controlling their speed were developed almost immediately. Today, various types of mechanical drives, hydraulic drives and electric drives compete with one another in the industrial drives market.

===Mechanical adjustable speed drives===
There are two types of mechanical drives, variable pitch drives and traction drives.

Variable pitch drives are pulley and belt drives in which the pitch diameter of one or both pulleys can be adjusted.

[[Traction drives]] transmit power through metal rollers running against mating metal rollers. The input/output speed ratio is adjusted by moving the rollers to change the
diameters of the contact path. Many different roller shapes and mechanical designs have been used.

===Hydraulic adjustable speed drives===
There are three types of hydraulic drives, those are: hydrostatic drives, hydrodynamic drives and hydroviscous drives.

A [[Transmission (mechanics)#Hydrostatic|hydrostatic drive]] consists of a hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor. Since positive displacement pumps and motors are used, one revolution of the pump or motor corresponds to a set volume of fluid flow that is determined by the displacement regardless of speed or [[torque]]. Speed is regulated by regulating the fluid flow with a valve or by changing the displacement of the pump or motor. Many different design variations have been used. A [[axial piston pump|swash plate]] drive employs an [[axial piston pump]] and/or motor in which the swash plate angle can be changed to adjust the displacement and thus adjust the speed.

Hydrodynamic drives or [[fluid coupling]]s use oil to transmit torque between an impeller on the constant-speed input shaft and a rotor on the adjustable-speed output shaft. The [[torque converter]] in the automatic transmission of a car is a hydrodynamic drive.

A hydroviscous drive consists of one or more discs connected to the input shaft pressed against a similar disc or discs connected to the output shaft. Torque is transmitted from the input shaft to the output shaft through an oil film between the discs. The transmitted torque is proportional to the pressure exerted by a hydraulic cylinder that presses the discs together. This effect may be used as a [[clutch]], such at the [[Hele-Shaw clutch]], or as a variable-speed drive, such as the [[Beier variable-ratio gear]].

===Continuously variable transmission (CVT)===
{{main|Continuously variable transmission}}
Mechanical and hydraulic adjustable speed drives are usually called [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]] or [[continuously variable transmission]]s  when they are used in vehicles, farm equipment and some other types of equipment.

===Electric adjustable speed drives===

====Types of control====
Control can mean either manually adjustable - by means of a [[potentiometer]] or linear [[hall effect]] device, (which is more resistant to dust and grease) or it can also be automatically controlled for example by using a rotational detector such as a [[Gray code]]  optical encoder.

====Types of  drives====
There are three general categories of electric drives: [[DC motor]] drives, [[eddy current]] drives and [[Electric motor|AC motor]] drives. Each of these general types can be further divided into numerous variations. Electric drives generally include both an electric motor and a speed control unit or system. The term ''drive'' is often applied to the controller without the motor. In the early days of electric drive technology, electromechanical control systems were used. Later, electronic controllers were designed using various types of vacuum tubes. As suitable solid state electronic components became available, new controller designs incorporated the latest electronic technology.

====DC drives====
DC drives are [[DC motor]] speed control systems. Since the speed of a DC motor is directly proportional to armature voltage and inversely proportional to motor flux (which is a function of field current), either armature voltage or field current can be used to control speed. Several types of DC motors are described in the [[electric motor]] article. The electric motor article also describes electronic speed controls used with various types of DC motors.

====Eddy current drives====
An [[eddy current]] drive (sometimes called a Dynamatic drive, after one of the most common brand names) consists of a fixed speed motor (generally an [[induction motor]]) and an eddy current clutch. The clutch contains a fixed speed rotor and an adjustable speed rotor separated by a small air gap. A direct current in a field coil produces a magnetic field that determines the [[torque]] transmitted from the input rotor to the output rotor. The controller provides closed loop speed regulation by varying clutch current, only allowing the clutch to transmit enough torque to operate at the desired speed. Speed feedback is typically provided via an integral AC tachometer.

Eddy current drives are slip-controlled systems the slip energy of which is necessarily all dissipated as heat. Such drives are therefore generally less efficient than [[AC/AC converter|AC/DC-AC conversion]] based drives. The motor develops the torque required by the load and operates at full speed. The output shaft transmits the same torque to the load, but turns at a slower speed. Since power is proportional to torque multiplied by speed, the input power is proportional to motor speed times operating torque while the output power is output speed times operating torque. The difference between the motor speed and the output speed is called the ''slip speed''. Power proportional to the slip speed times operating torque is dissipated as heat in the clutch. While it has been surpassed by the variable-frequency drive in most variable-speed applications, the eddy current clutch is still often used to couple motors to high-inertia loads that are frequently stopped and started, such as stamping presses, conveyors, hoisting machinery, and some larger machine tools, allowing gradual starting, with less maintenance than a mechanical clutch or hydraulic transmission.

====AC drives====
AC drives are [[Electric motor|AC motor]] speed control systems.

A '''slip-controlled wound-rotor [[induction motor]] (WRIM) drive''' controls speed by varying motor slip via rotor slip rings either by electronically recovering slip power fed back to the stator bus or by varying the resistance of external resistors in the rotor circuit. Along with eddy current drives, resistance-based WRIM drives have lost popularity because they are less efficient than [[AC/AC converter|AC/DC-AC]]-based WRIM drives and are used only in special situations.

Slip energy recovery systems return energy to the WRIM's stator bus, converting slip energy and feeding it back to the stator supply. Such recovered energy would otherwise be wasted as heat in resistance-based WRIM drives. Slip energy recovery variable-speed drives are used in such applications as large pumps and fans, wind turbines, shipboard propulsion systems, large hydro-pumps/generators and utility energy storage flywheels. Early slip energy recovery systems using electromechanical components for [[AC/AC converter|AC/DC-AC]] conversion (i.e., consisting of rectifier, DC motor and AC generator) are termed ''Kramer drives'', more recent systems using [[variable-frequency drive]]s (VFDs) being referred to as ''static Kramer drives''.

In general, a [[variable-frequency drive|VFD]] in its most basic configuration controls the speed of an [[induction motor|induction]] or [[synchronous machine|synchronous]] motor by adjusting the frequency of the power supplied to the motor. [[Image:AF Drive V Hz Etc.png|240px|right]]

When changing [[variable-frequency drive|VFD]] frequency in standard low-performance variable-torque applications using Volt-per-Hertz (V/Hz) control, the AC motor's voltage-to-frequency ratio can be maintained constant, and its power can be varied, between the minimum and maximum operating frequencies up to a base frequency. Constant voltage operation above base frequency, and therefore with reduced V/Hz ratio, provides reduced torque and constant power capability.

Regenerative AC drives are a type of AC drive which have the capacity to recover the braking energy of a load moving faster than the motor speed (an overhauling load) and return it to the power system.

The [[variable-frequency drive|VFD]] article provides additional information on electronic speed controls used with various types of AC motors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1119">An '''Anisothermal plasma''' is a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] which thermal state can be approximated by more than one temperature for the different [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the plasma. 
The degrees of freedom refer to translation ([[kinetic energy]]), rotation, vibration of each particle type. 

Examples of anisothermal plasmas can be found among low-pressure plasmas that are excited by high frequency [[electric field]]s, see [[frequency classification of plasmas]]. They generally exhibit hot [[electron]]s that are powered by the alternating electric field, and a neutral and [[ion]] component, which is significantly colder due the low efficiency of the energy transfer between light electrons and heavy neutrals and ions.

The term [[nonthermal plasma]] includes anisothermal plasmas and means that the different degrees of freedom of the plasma are ''not'' in [[thermal equilibrium]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7932">The '''autoignition temperature''' or '''kindling point''' of a substance is the lowest temperature at which it [[Spontaneous combustion|spontaneously ignites]] in normal atmosphere without an external source of ignition, such as a flame or spark. This temperature is required to supply the [[activation energy]] needed for [[combustion]]. The temperature at which a chemical ignites decreases as the pressure or oxygen concentration increases. It is usually applied to a combustible fuel mixture.

Autoignition temperatures of liquid chemicals are typically measured using a {{convert|500|ml|adj=on}} flask placed in a temperature-controlled oven in accordance with the procedure described in [[ASTM International|ASTM]] E659.&lt;ref&gt;E659 – 78 (Reapproved 2000), "Standard Test Method for Autoignition Temperature of Liquid Chemicals", ASTM, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959.&lt;/ref&gt;

When measured for plastics, autoignition temperature can be also  measured under elevated pressure and at 100% oxygen concentration. The resulting value is used as a predictor of viability for high-oxygen service. The main testing standard for this is ASTM G72.&lt;ref&gt;S. Grynko, "Material Properties Explained" (2012), {{ISBN|1-4700-7991-7}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autoignition equation==
The time &lt;math&gt;t_\text{ig}&lt;/math&gt; it takes for a material to reach its autoignition temperature &lt;math&gt;T_\text{ig}&lt;/math&gt; when exposed to a [[heat flux]] &lt;math&gt;q''&lt;/math&gt; is given by the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Fire Behavior. {{ISBN|0-8273-7732-0}}. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t_\text{ig} = \frac{\pi}{4} k \rho c \left [ \frac{T_\text{ig} - T_0}{q''} \right]^2, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' = [[thermal conductivity]], ''ρ'' = density, and ''c'' = [[specific heat capacity]] of the material of interest, &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial temperature of the material (or the temperature of the bulk material).

==Autoignition point of selected substances==
Temperatures vary widely in the literature and should only be used as estimates. Factors that may cause variation include [[partial pressure]] of oxygen, altitude, humidity, and amount of time required for ignition. Generally the autoignition temperature for hydrocarbon/air mixtures decreases with increasing [[molecular mass]] and increasing [[Catenation|chain length]]. The autoignition temperature is also higher for branched-chain hydrocarbons than for straight-chain hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;Zabetakis, M. G. (1965), Flammability characteristics of combustible gases and vapours, U.S. Department of Mines, Bulletin 627.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3639">The '''availability factor''' of a [[power plant]] is the amount of time that it is able to produce [[electricity]] over a certain period, divided by the amount of the time in the period. Occasions where only partial capacity is available may or may not be deducted. Where they are deducted, the metric is titled ''equivalent availability factor'' (EAF). The availability factor should not be confused with the [[capacity factor]]. The capacity factor for a given period can never exceed the availability factor for the same period. The difference arises when the plant is run at less than full capacity, in which case the capacity factor is less than the availability factor.

The availability of a power plant varies greatly depending on the type of [[fuel]], the design of the plant and how the plant is operated. Everything else being equal, plants that are run less frequently have higher availability factors because they require less maintenance and because more inspections and maintenance can be scheduled during idle time. Most [[thermal power station]]s, such as [[coal]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]] and [[nuclear power]] plants, have availability factors between 70% and 90%. Newer plants tend to have significantly higher availability factors, but preventive maintenance is as important as improvements in design and technology. [[Gas turbine]]s have relatively high availability factors, ranging from 80% to 99%. Gas turbines are commonly used for [[peaking power plant]]s, [[co-generation]] plants and the first stage of [[combined cycle]] plants.

Originally the term availability factor was used only for power plants that depended on an active, controlled supply of fuel, typically fossil or later also [[Nuclear fuel|nuclear]]. The emergence of [[renewable energy]] such as [[hydro power|hydro]], [[wind power|wind]] and [[solar power]], which operate without an active, controlled supply of fuel and which come to a standstill when their natural supply of energy ceases, requires a more careful distinction between the availability factor and the capacity factor. By convention, such zero production periods are counted against the capacity factor but not against the availability factor, which thus remains defined as depending on an active, controlled supply of fuel, along with factors concerning reliability and maintenance. A wind turbine cannot operate in wind speeds above a certain limit, which counts against its availability factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.huronwind.com/main.php?page=data |website= [[Huron Wind|huronwind.com]] |title= AVAILABILITY FACTOR |accessdate= 2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this definition, modern [[wind turbine]]s which require very little maintenance, have very high availability factors, up to about 98%. [[Photovoltaic power stations]] which have few or no moving parts and which can undergo planned inspections and maintenance during night have an availability factor approaching or equal to 100%.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3952">'''Borazon''' is a brand name of a cubic form of [[boron nitride]] (cBN). Its color ranges from black to brown and gold, depending on the chemical bond. It is one of the hardest known materials, along with various forms of [[diamond]] and [[boron nitride]]. Borazon is a [[crystal]] created by heating equal quantities of [[boron]] and [[nitrogen]] at temperatures greater than 1800&amp;nbsp;°C (3300&amp;nbsp;°F) at 7&amp;nbsp;[[gigapascal|GPa]] (1&amp;nbsp;million [[pound-force per square inch|lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]). 

Borazon was first produced in 1957 by [[Robert H. Wentorf, Jr.]], a [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] working for the [[General Electric Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = R. H. Wentorf| title =Cubic Form of Boron Nitride| journal = J. Chem. Phys. | volume = 26 | page = 956 | year = 1957| doi =10.1063/1.1745964| issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, General Electric adopted the name Borazon as its [[trademark]] for the material.

==Uses and production==
Borazon has a number of uses, such as: cutting tools, dies, punches, shears, knives, saw blades, bearing rings, needles, rollers, spacers, balls, pump, compressor parts, engine &amp; drive train components (e.g. camshafts, crankshafts, gears, valve stems, drive shafts, CV joints, piston pins, fuel injectors, turbochargers, and aerospace and land-based gas turbine parts such as vanes, blades, nozzles, and seals), surgical knives, blades, scissors, honing, superfinishing, cylinder liners, connecting rods, grinding of steel and paper mill rolls, and gears.

Prior to the production of Borazon, [[diamond]] was the preferred [[abrasive]] used for grinding very hard [[superalloys]] but it could not be used effectively on [[steel]]s because carbon tends to dissolve in iron at high temperatures. [[Aluminium oxide]] was the conventional abrasive used on hardened steel tools.&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5308367-description.html Description of Borazon and Borozon as prior art in patent from 31 December 1969]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borazon replaced aluminium oxide for grinding hardened steels owing to its superior abrasive properties, comparable to that of diamond.&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt; Borazon is used in industrial applications to shape tools, as it can withstand temperatures greater than 2000 °C (3632 °F), much higher than that of a pure diamond at 871 °C (1600 °F).&lt;ref name=BN&gt;{{cite book| title = Landolt-Börnstein - Group VIII Advanced Materials and Technologies: Powder Metallurgy Data. Refractory, Hard and Intermetallic Materials| chapter =  13.5 Properties of diamond and cubic boron nitride | volume = 2A2| doi = 10.1007/b83029| isbn = 978-3-540-42961-6| pages = 118–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses include [[jewellery]] designing, [[glass]] cutting and laceration of diamonds.

CBN-coated grinding wheels, referred to as Borazon wheels, are routinely used in the machining of hard ferrous metals, cast irons, and nickel-base and cobalt-base superalloys. They can grind more material, to a higher degree of accuracy, than any other abrasive. The limiting factor in the life of such tools is typically determined not by wear on the cutting surface but by its break-down and separation from the metal core resulting from failure of the bonding layer.&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt;

It is a [[generation IV reactor|generation IV]] demonstration project by the [[China National Nuclear Corporation]] (CNNC).
The project is also known as '''Xiapu fast reactor pilot project'''.&lt;ref name="wnn"/&gt;
Construction of the reactor started in late 2017.
The reactor will have an output of 1500 [[MWth]] thermal power and 600 MW electric power.&lt;ref name=iaea&gt;{{cite web|title=CFR-600 (China Institute of Atomic Energy, China)|url=https://aris.iaea.org/PDF/CFR-600.pdf|publisher=IAEA|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wnn"/&gt;

The CFR-600 is part of the Chinese plan to reach a closed [[nuclear fuel cycle]].
Fast neutron reactors are considered the main technology in the future for [[nuclear power in China]].

A larger commercial-scale reactor, the CFR-1000, is also planned.&lt;ref name="wnn"/&gt;

On the same site, a second 600&amp;nbsp;MW fast reactor is planned to be built in the future, a 600&amp;nbsp;MW HTR-PM600 and four 1000&amp;nbsp;MW [[AP1000|CAP1000]] are proposed.&lt;ref name="CCCC_12-03-2015"&gt;''CCCC-FHDI wins bid for quot;feasibility study of offshore engineering of 600MW fast reactor nuclear power demonstration project in Xiapu'', 12.03.2015.

'''''Carnobacterium pleistocenium''''' is recently discovered [[bacterium]] from the [[arctic]] part of [[Alaska]].  It was found in [[permafrost]], seemingly frozen there for 32,000 years.  Melting the ice, however, brought these [[extremophiles]] back to life.  This is the first case of an organism "coming back to life" from ancient ice.  These bacterial cells were discovered in a tunnel dug by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] in the 1960s to allow scientists to study the permafrost in preparation for the [[Construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|construction]] of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Trans-Alaska pipeline system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pikuta|first=E.

The discovery of this bacterium is of particular interest for [[NASA]], for it may be possible for such life to exist in the permafrost of [[Mars]] or on the surface of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. It is also of interest for [[scientist]]s investigating the potential for [[cryogenically]] freezing life forms to reduce the transportation costs (in terms of life support systems) that would be associated with long-duration [[Spaceflight|space travel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/othernews/050223_arctic_life.html|title=Creatures Frozen for 32,000 Years Still Alive|publisher=LiveScience|author=Robert Roy Britt | date=February 23, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community wind''' projects are locally owned by farmers, investors, businesses, schools, utilities, or other public or private entities who utilize wind energy to support and reduce energy costs to the local community. The key feature is that local community members have a significant, direct financial stake in the project beyond land lease payments and tax revenue. Projects may be used for on-site power or to generate wholesale power for sale, usually on a commercial-scale greater than 100&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greeneconomypost.com/community-wind-power-benefits-8267.htm |title=Community Wind Power Benefits: Local communities get a piece of the action |publisher=Greeneconomypost.com |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community wind farms==

===Australia===
[[File:Hepburn Wind Farm 2011.jpg|thumb|Hepburn Wind Farm]]
{{See also|Wind power in Australia}}
The [[Hepburn Wind Project]] is a [[wind farm]] at Leonards Hill near [[Daylesford, Victoria]], north-west of [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].  It comprises two 2MW [[wind turbine]]s which produce enough power for 2,300 households.&lt;ref name=comm&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/07/25/2314235.htm Victorian community goes it alone on wind farm] ''ABC News'', July 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the first Australian community-owned wind farm. The initiative has emerged because the community felt that the state and federal governments were not doing enough to address [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=comm/&gt;

===Canada===
{{see also|WindShare}}
Community wind power is in its infancy in Canada but there are reasons for optimism. One such reason is the launch of a new [[Feed-in tariff|Feed-in Tariff]] (FIT) [[Green Energy Act 2009|program in the Province of Ontario]] .   A number of community wind projects are in development in Ontario but the first project that is likely to obtain a FIT contract and connect to the grid is the [[Pukwis Community Wind Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pukwis.ca |title=Pukwis Community Wind Park |publisher=Pukwis.ca |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pukwis will be unique in that it is a joint Aboriginal/Community wind project that will be majority-owned by the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, with a local renewable energy co-operative (the Pukwis Energy Co-operative) owning the remainder of the project.

===Denmark===

In 1997, [[Samsø]] won a government competition to become a model [[renewable energy]] community. An offshore [[wind farm]] comprising 10 turbines (making a total of 21 altogether including land-based windmills), was completed, funded by the islanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metaefficient.com/archives/renewable-power/danish-island-is-energy-self-sufficient.html|title=Danish Island Is Energy Self-Sufficient|work=MetaEfficient}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now 100% of its electricity comes from [[wind power]] and 75% of its heat comes from [[solar power]] and [[biomass energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/08/eveningnews/main2549273.shtml|title=Danish Island Is Energy Self-Sufficient|date=8 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Energy Academy has opened in Ballen, with a visitor education center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energiakademiet.dk/default_uk.asp |title=Samsø Energy Academy |publisher=Energiakademiet.dk |accessdate=2010-12-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511142853/http://www.energiakademiet.dk/default_uk.asp |archive-date=2011-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, hundreds of thousands of people have invested in citizens' wind farms across the country and thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises are running successful businesses in a new sector that in 2008 employed 90,000 people and generated 8 percent of Germany's electricity.&lt;ref name=emp&gt;Stefan Gsänger.

In the German district of [[North Frisia]] there are more than 60 wind farms with a capacity of about 700 MW, and 90 percent are community-owned. North Frisia is seen to be a model location for community wind, leading the way for other regions, especially in southern Germany.&lt;ref name="Tildy Bayar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/07/community-wind-arrives-stateside |title=Community Wind Arrives Stateside |author=Tildy Bayar |date=5 July 2012  |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2006, a village [[Panchayati raj|panchayat]] (local self-governing body) in Tamil Nadu state has become completely self-sufficient in energy by using renewable sources like wind, solar and biogas.

The Odanthurai village [[Panchayati raj|panchayat]] near Coimbatore city comprises 11 villages and has a population of about 8,000. By 2009, it had set up its own 350&amp;nbsp;kW windfarm to meet its energy needs. The windmill was set up at Malwadi near Udumalpet and generates about 8 lakh (800,000) units annually. The power requirement for Odanthurai stands at about 4.5 lakh  (450,000) units, and the local panchayat body is now selling the surplus power to the state grid. This gives the [[Panchayati raj|panchayat]] an annual income of 19 lakh rupees.

The village cooperative is also using other sources of renewable energy. It has 65 solar streetlights in two hamlets and a nine-KW (kilowatt) biomass gasifier to pump drinking water from the river to the overhead tanks. Doing so, Odanthurai became the first local body in India to utilize the remunerative enterprises scheme of the state government.

The project will include the installation of three phases of 12 wind turbines with capacities of 3 to 4.5 MW each. The aim is to put the wind farm into service in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2008/10/dutch-farmers-ready-for-wind-energy-53986 |title=Dutch Farmers Ready For Wind Energy |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands has an active community of wind cooperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duurzameenergie.org/site/web-links/ode-windco-peraties.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703185040/http://www.duurzameenergie.org/site/web-links/ode-windco-peraties.html |archivedate=2013-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They build and operate wind parks in all regions of the Netherlands. This started in the 1980s with the first Lagerweij turbines. Back then, these turbines could be financed by the members of the cooperatives.
Today, the cooperatives build larger wind parks, but not as large as commercial parties do. Some still operate self-sufficiently, others partner with larger commercial wind park developers.

Because of the very unproductive state policies for financing wind parks in the Netherlands, the cooperatives have developed a new financing model, where members of a cooperative do not have to pay taxes for the electricity they generate with their community wind park.
In this construction the Zelfleveringsmodel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duurzameenergie.org/ODEwiki/Zelfleverings_Model |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324224925/http://www.duurzameenergie.org/ODEwiki/Zelfleverings_Model |archivedate=2010-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the cooperative operates the wind park, and a traditional energy company only acts as a service provider, for billing and energy balance on the public grid.
This is the new role for energy companies in the future, where production is largely decentralized.

In 2012 a new company launched a new business model for community energy, Windcentrale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windcentrale.nl|title=Wek je eigen groene stroom op met Winddelen!|author=|date=|website=Windcentrale}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wind turbine is sold in physical shares to families. Every share does not give financial gains, but real power, 500 kWh per year, average. A power company, part of the model, subtracts the generated amount of power, from the yearly power bill. Owners only have to pay for the power they used in excess of the amount their share generated. The Windcentrale started with 2 existing turbines that were sold to about 3 months. 8 months later they sold a turbine in a single evening. By the end of 2016 they were a community of about 17.000 members with 10 turbines and about 15 MW rated power. Every turbine is owned by a separate cooperative, with the Windcentrale doing all organizational work in the cooperative. In three years they grew to the same size, in members, than older wind cooperatives with average age of 25 years. Too of these older wind cooperatives, DeltaWind and Zeeuwind are run as a business and are building a 100 MW wind farm Krammer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windparkkrammer.nl/|title=Home - Windpark Krammer|author=|date=|website=Windpark Krammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, there are 43 communities who are in the process of or already producing renewable energy through co-operative structures in the UK. They are set up and run by everyday people, mostly local residents, who are investing their time and money and together installing large wind turbines, solar panels, or hydro-electric power for their local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/06/communities-renewable-energy?newsfeed=true |title=The communities taking renewable energy into their own hands |author=Ed Mayo |date=6 January 2012 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baywind Energy Co-operative]] was the first [[co-operative]] to own wind turbines in the [[United Kingdom]]. Baywind was modeled on the similar wind turbine cooperatives and other [[renewable energy]] co-operatives that are common in [[Scandinavia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oti.globalwatchonline.com/online_pdfs/36247MR.pdf?pubpdfdload=05%2F592 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929160354/http://www.oti.globalwatchonline.com/online_pdfs/36247MR.pdf?pubpdfdload=05%2F592 |archive-date=2007-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was founded as an [[industrial and provident society]] in 1996. It grew to exceed 1,300 members, each with one vote.

A proportion of the profits is invested in local community environmental initiatives through the Baywind Energy Conservation Trust. As of 2006, Baywind owns a 2.5&amp;nbsp;megawatt five-turbine [[wind farm]] at Harlock Hill near [[Ulverston]], [[Cumbria]] (operational since 29 January 1997), and one of the 600&amp;nbsp;kilowatt turbines at the [[Haverigg II]] wind farm near [[Millom]], Cumbria.

Community-owned schemes in Scotland include one on the [[Isle of Gigha]]. The Heritage Trust set up Gigha Renewable Energy to buy and operate  three [[Vestas]] V27 [[wind turbine]]s, known locally as ''The Dancing Ladies'' or ''Creideas, Dòchas is Carthannas'' (Gaelic for ''[[Theological virtues|Faith, Hope and Charity]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hi-energy.org.uk/Lets-Talk-Renewables/letstalkrenewables-spring2007.pdf |format=PDF |title=Let's Talk Renewables |publisher=HIE |accessdate=2008-01-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407011013/http://www.hi-energy.org.uk/Lets-Talk-Renewables/letstalkrenewables-spring2007.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were commissioned on 21 January 2005 and are capable of generating up to 675&amp;nbsp;kW of power. Revenue is produced by selling the electricity to the grid via an intermediary called Green Energy UK.

===United States===

In 2009, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory published a report that identified three different types of community wind projects in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lantz|first1=E|last2=Tegen|first2=S|title=Economic Development Impacts of Community Wind Projects: A Review and Empirical Evaluation|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy09osti/45555.pdf|website=nrel.gov|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first model describes a project owned by a municipal utility, such as the Hull Wind Project in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hullwind.org/|title=Hull Wind.org, Wind Power, Wind Energy in Hull, MA - Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second model is a wind project that is jointly owned by local community members, such as the MinWind Projects near Luverne, Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minwind III - IX, Luverne, MN: Community Wind Project|url=http://windustry.org/resources/minwind-iii-ix-luverne-mn-community-wind-project|website=windustry.org|publisher=Windustry|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third type is a flip-style ownership.  This model allows local investors to partner with a corporation in order to take advantage of Production Tax Credit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC) |url=http://dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=US13F |website=dsireusa.org |publisher=Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency |accessdate=13 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929061644/http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=US13F |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; federal incentives.  Flip projects have been built in Minnesota and Texas.

==Business models==

===Community shared ownership===
In a community-based model, the developer/manager of a wind farm shares ownership of the project with area landowners and other community members.  Property owners whose land was used for the wind farm are generally given a choice between a monthly cash lease and ownership units in the development.

===Cooperative===
A wind turbine cooperative, also known as a wind energy cooperative, is a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise that follows the [[cooperative]] model, investing in wind turbines or wind farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Houx |first=Ramona Du |url=http://maineinsights.com/fox-islands-electric-cooperative-a-model |title=Fox Islands Electric Cooperative — a model for community wind |publisher=Maineinsights.com |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooperative model was developed in [[wind power in Denmark|Denmark]].  The model has also spread to [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Australia]] and [[United Kingdom]], with isolated examples elsewhere.

=== Municipal ===
Some places have enacted policies to  encourage development of municipally owned and operated wind turbines on town land. These projects are publicly owned and tax exempt. An example is the Hull Wind One project in Massachusetts' Boston Harbor in 2001. A 660&amp;nbsp;kW wind turbine was installed, and is still a great example of small scale commercial wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenchipstocks.com/report/community-wind-power/547 |title=Community Wind Power |publisher=Greenchipstocks.com |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts of community wind energy ==

=== Economic ===
Once a wind farm project is established in a community, jobs are needed for: manufacturing the materials needed to build the project, transportation of supplies to the project area, and construction of the project as well as building roads leading to the project.  After the project is complete, jobs will be needed to maintain and operate the facility.  According to a study by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, wind energy produces 27% more jobs per kilowatt-hour than coal plants and 66% more jobs than natural gas plants. 3.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/33590.pdf |title=Wind Power: Economic Development for Rural Communities |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Landowners will also collect revenues for hosting turbines on their property.  Given a typical wind turbine spacing requirements, a 250-acre farm could increase annual farm income by $14,000 per year with little effect on their normal farming and ranching operations. 4.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;  Community wind energy projects increase local property tax revenue because there was very little to be taxed previously due to the sparse population and vast farm land.  Once the wind turbines are in service they are taxed, creating much needed revenue for the local community.

=== Social ===
The Midwest and the Great Plains regions in the United States are ideal areas for community wind energy projects; they are also often prone to drought.  Fossil fuel plants use large amounts of water for cooling purposes which is detrimental to communities' water supply if there is a drought.  Wind turbines do not use any water since there is no considerable amount of heat produced during energy generation.  Wind energy adds power to the electric grid which decreases the amount of oil needed to generate a community's electricity.  Local land owners, who produce the wind energy, can also control the amount of energy produced, which expands the regional energy mix.  Overall community wind energy reduces the local community's dependence on oil but, because of the subsidies involved, can greatly increase their costs for electricity.[citation needed]

Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor. Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.&lt;ref name="windmeasurementinternational"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.windmeasurementinternational.com/wind-info/wind-energy_faq.php | title=FAQ| publisher=Wind Measurement International| accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy, issues, and legislation ==
In 1992, the renewable energy production tax credit of 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour was established.  In February 2009, through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Congress acted to provide a three-year extension of the PTC through December 31, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awea.org/ei_policy_ptc.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207112031/http://www.awea.org/ei_policy_ptc.cfm |archivedate=2010-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wind projects that were up and running in 2009 and 2010 can choose to receive a 30% investment tax credit instead of the PTC.  The investment tax credit is also an option for wind projects that are in service before 2013 if the final construction is complete before the end of 2010.  Smaller wind farms (100&amp;nbsp;kW or less) can receive a credit for 30% towards the cost of installment of the system.  The ITC, written into law through the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, is available for equipment installed from October 3, 2008 through December 31, 2016. The value of the credit is now uncapped, through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.&lt;ref name="awea.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awea.org/ei_legislative.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207112218/http://www.awea.org/ei_legislative.cfm |archivedate=2010-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure wind energy's future in the energy market, the renewable electricity standard (RES) is a policy in which market mechanisms guarantee a growing percentage of electricity produced comes from renewable sources, like wind energy.  The RES exists in 28 states (not at a national level).  An example is the Obama-Biden New Energy for America plan, which sets future goals of rapid renewable energy production at 10% by 2012.&lt;ref name="awea.org"/&gt;

A pressing issue of concern is the lack of a modern interstate transmission grid which delivers carbon free electricity to customers.  Currently the US Senate and the Natural Resources Committee have reported the bill out of committee on June 17, 2009. A combined energy and climate bill is expected to be considered by the full Senate this fall.  In the US House of Representatives the House Energy and Commerce Committee approved a comprehensive energy and climate bill on May 21, 2010.
 
The clean air and climate change policy is goal to switch from fossil fuel energy sources to renewable carbon-free energy sources for electricity production.  Generating 20% of U.S. electricity from wind would be the climate equivalent of removing 140 million vehicles from the roadways.  Currently the US Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works has control over the legislation and will begin to complete a markup by September 25, 2009.  The House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act on June 26, 2009, comprising a provision to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. It also allocates a portion of the allowances given away for free to energy efficiency and renewable energy. However, the allowances flow through state governments rather than directly to renewable generators.

Overall federal funding for community wind research and development is insufficient and even more so when compared to other fuels and energy sources.  In 2009 the US Department of Energy (DOE) received $118 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for wind energy research and development.  In 2010 the Senate passed a bill granting the DOE $85 million for the DOE wind program.  For the same purpose, the House of Representatives allowed the DOE $70 million.

[[Image:Ericsson engine4.PNG|thumb|Rendering of an Ericsson engine. A cold gaseous working fluid, such as atmospheric air (shown in blue), enters the cylinder via a non-return valve at the top-right. The air is compressed by the piston (black) as the piston moves upward. The compressed air is stored in the pneumatic tank (at left). A two-way valve (gray) moves downward to allow pressurized air to pass through the regenerator where it is preheated. The air then enters the space below the piston, which is an externally heated expansion-chamber. The air expands and does work on the piston as it moves upward. After the expansion stroke, the two-way valve moves upward, thus closing off the tank and opening the exhaust port. As the piston moves back downward in the exhaust stroke, hot air is pushed back through the regenerator, which reclaims most of the heat, before passing out the exhaust port (left) as cool air.]]

The '''Ericsson cycle''' is named after inventor [[John Ericsson]] who designed and built many unique [[heat engine]]s based on various [[thermodynamic cycle]]s.  He is credited with inventing two unique heat engine cycles and developing practical engines based on these cycles.  His ''first'' cycle is now known as the [[closed Brayton cycle]], while his second cycle is what is now called the Ericsson cycle.
Ericsson is one of the few who built open-cycle engines&lt;ref name="haeericsson1852"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/ericsson/ericsson-caloric-engine-of-1851/the-ericsson-caloric-engine|title=Ericsson's open-cyle engine of 1852|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but he also built closed-cycle ones&lt;ref name="haeericsson1833"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/ericsson/the-engine-of-1833/caloric-engine|title=Ericsson's closed-cyle engine of 1833|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Ideal Ericsson cycle==
[[File:Ericsson-Prozess Diagramme.png|thumb|Ideal Ericsson cycle]]
The following is a list of the four processes that occur between the four stages of the ideal Ericsson cycle:
*Process 1 -&gt; 2: [[Isothermal process|Isothermal]] compression.  The compression space is assumed to be [[intercooler|intercooled]], so the gas undergoes isothermal compression. The compressed air flows into a storage tank at constant pressure.  In the ideal cycle, there is no heat transfer across the tank walls.
*Process 2 -&gt; 3: [[Isobaric process|Isobaric]] heat addition.  From the tank, the compressed air flows through the regenerator and picks up heat at a high constant-pressure on the way to the heated power-cylinder.
*Process 3 -&gt; 4: [[Isothermal process|Isothermal]] expansion.  The power-cylinder expansion-space is heated externally, and the gas undergoes isothermal expansion.
*Process 4 -&gt; 1: Isobaric heat removal.  Before the air is released as exhaust, it is passed back through the regenerator, thus cooling the gas at a low constant pressure, and heating the regenerator for the next cycle.

===Comparison with Carnot, Diesel, Otto, and Stirling cycles===

The ideal Otto and Diesel cycles are not totally reversible because they involve heat transfer through a finite temperature difference during the irreversible isochoric/isobaric heat-addition and isochoric heat-rejection processes. The aforementioned irreversibility renders the thermal efficiency of these cycles less than that of a Carnot engine operating within the same limits of temperature. Another cycle that features isobaric heat-addition and heat-rejection processes is the Ericsson cycle. The Ericsson cycle is an altered version of the Carnot cycle in which the two isentropic processes featured in the Carnot cycle are replaced by two constant-pressure regeneration processes.

The Ericsson cycle is often compared with the [[Stirling cycle]], since the engine designs based on these respective cycles are both [[external combustion engine]]s with regenerators. The Ericsson is perhaps most similar to the so-called "double-acting" type of Stirling engine, in which the displacer piston also acts as the power piston.  Theoretically, both of these cycles have so called ''ideal'' efficiency, which is the highest allowed by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].  The most well-known ideal cycle is the [[Carnot cycle]], although a useful ''Carnot engine'' is not known to have been invented.
The theoretical efficiencies for both, Ericsson and Stirling cycles acting in the same limits are equal to the Carnot Efficiency for same limits.

===Comparison with the Brayton cycle===
{{Main|Brayton cycle}}
The first cycle Ericsson developed is now called the "[[Brayton cycle]]", commonly applied to the rotary [[jet engine]]s for [[airplane]]s.

The second Ericsson cycle is the cycle most commonly referred to as simply the "Ericsson cycle".  The (second) Ericsson cycle is also the limit of an ideal gas-turbine Brayton cycle, operating with multistage intercooled [[Gas compression|compression]], and multistage expansion with reheat and regeneration.  Compared to the Brayton cycle which uses adiabatic compression and expansion, the second Ericsson cycle uses isothermal compression and expansion, thus producing more net work per stroke.  Also the use of regeneration in the Ericsson cycle increases efficiency by reducing the required heat input.  For further comparisons of thermodynamic cycles, see [[heat engine]].

==Ericsson engine==

[[File:Ericsson Caloric engine.jpg|thumb|Ericsson Caloric engine]]

[[File:Ericsson Caloric Engine.JPG|thumb|Ericsson Caloric Engine]]
The Ericsson engine is based on the Ericsson cycle, and is known as an "[[external combustion engine]]", because it is externally heated. To improve efficiency, the engine has a [[regenerative heat exchanger|regenerator]] or [[recuperator]] between the compressor and the expander. The engine can be run open- or closed-cycle.  Expansion occurs simultaneously with compression, on opposite sides of the piston.

==Regenerator==
{{Main|Regenerative heat exchanger}}
Ericsson coined the term "regenerator" for his independent invention of the mixed-flow counter-current heat exchanger.  However, Rev. [[Robert Stirling]] had invented the same device, prior to Ericsson, so the invention is credited to Stirling.  Stirling called it an "economiser" or "economizer", because it increased the fuel economy of various types of heat processes.  The invention was found to be useful, in many other devices and systems, where it became more widely used, since other types of engines became favored over the Stirling engine.  The term "regenerator" is now the name given to the component in the Stirling engine.

The term "[[recuperator]]" refers to a separated-flow, counter-current heat exchanger.  As if this weren't confusing enough, a mixed-flow regenerator is sometimes used as a quasi-separated-flow recuperator. This can be done through the use of moving [[valves]], or by a rotating regenerates with fixed baffles, or by the use of other moving parts.  When heat is recovered from exhaust gases and used to preheat combustion air, typically the term recuperator is used, because the two flows are separate.

==History==
In 1791, before Ericsson, [[John Barber (engineer)|John Barber]] proposed a similar engine. The Barber engine used a bellows compressor and a turbine expander, but it lacked a regenerator/recuperator. There are no records of a working Barber engine. Ericsson invented and patented his first engine using an external version of the Brayton cycle in 1833 (number 6409/1833 British). This was 18&amp;nbsp;years before [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] and 43&amp;nbsp;years before [[George Brayton|Brayton]]. Brayton engines were all piston engines and for the most part, [[internal combustion]] versions of the un-recuperated Ericsson engine. The "[[Brayton cycle]]" is now known as the [[gas turbine]] cycle, which differs from the original "Brayton cycle" in the use of a turbine compressor and expander. The gas turbine cycle is used for all modern gas turbine and [[turbojet]] engines, however simple cycle turbines are often recuperated to improve efficiency and these recuperated turbines more closely resemble Ericsson's work.

Ericsson eventually abandoned the open cycle in favor of the traditional closed Stirling cycle.

Ericsson's engine can easily be modified to operate in a closed-cycle mode, using a second, lower-pressure, cooled container between the original exhaust and intake. In closed cycle, the lower pressure can be significantly above ambient pressure, and He or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; working gas can be used. Because of the higher pressure difference between the upward and downward movement of the work-piston, specific output can be greater than of a valveless [[Stirling engine]]. The added cost is the [[valve]]. Ericsson's engine also minimizes mechanical losses: the power necessary for compression does not go through crank-bearing frictional losses, but is applied directly from the expansion force. The piston-type Ericsson engine can potentially be the highest efficiency heat engine arrangement ever constructed. Admittedly, this has yet to be proven in practical applications.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Ericsson designed and built a very great number of engines running on various cycles including steam, Stirling, Brayton, externally heated diesel air fluid cycle. He ran his engines on a great variety of fuels including coal and solar heat.

Ericsson was also responsible for an early use of the screw [[propeller]] for ship propulsion, in the [[USS Princeton (1843)|USS ''Princeton'']], built in 1842–43.

===Caloric ship ''Ericsson''===
In 1851 the Ericsson-cycle engine (the second of the two discussed here) was used to power a 2,000-ton ship, the [[Caloric Ship Ericsson|caloric ship ''Ericsson'']]&lt;ref name="haeericssonship"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/ericsson/ericsson-caloric-engine-of-1851/story-of-ericsson-caloric-ship|title=Ericsson's Caloric Ship|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and ran flawlessly for 73&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genuineideas.com/HallofInventions/SolarPivots/ericssonengine.htm |title=Ericsson Caloric Engine |publisher=Genuineideas.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination engine produced about {{convert|300|hp}}. It had a combination of four&amp;nbsp;dual-piston engines; the larger expansion piston/cylinder, at {{convert|14|ft}} in diameter, was perhaps the largest piston ever built. Rumor has it that tables were placed on top of those pistons (obviously in the cool compression chamber, not the hot power chamber) and dinner was served and eaten, while the engine was running at full power.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} At 6.5&amp;nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|RPM]] the pressure was limited to {{convert|8|psi|abbr=on}}. According to the official report it only consumed 4200&amp;nbsp;kg coal per 24 hours (original target was 8000&amp;nbsp;kg, which is still better than contemporary steam engines). The one [[sea trial]] proved that even though the engine ran well, the ship was underpowered. Some time after the trials, the ''Ericsson'' sank. When it was raised, the Ericsson-cycle engine was removed and a steam engine took its place. The ship was wrecked when blown aground in November 1892 at the entrance to [[Barkley Sound]], British Columbia, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pacificshipwrecks.ca/english/wrecks.html{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today's potential==

The Ericsson cycle (and the similar Brayton cycle) receives renewed interest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assystem.com/en/markets/projects-detail/36/indeho.html |title=Projects - detail |publisher=Assystem |date=2015-11-18 |accessdate=2015-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222112555/http://www.assystem.com/en/markets/projects-detail/36/indeho.html |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; today to extract power from the exhaust heat of gas (and [[producer gas]]) engines and solar concentrators.  An important advantage of the Ericsson cycle over the widely known [[Stirling engine]] is often not recognized : the volume of the heat exchanger does not adversely affect the efficiency.

(...)''despite having significant advantages over the Stirling. Amongst them, it is worth to note that the Ericsson engine heat exchangers are not dead volumes, whereas the Stirling engine heat exchangers designer has to face a difficult compromise between as large heat transfer areas as possible, but as small heat exchanger volumes as possible.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.icrepq.com/icrepq%2713/594-fula.pdf |title=In-Cylinder Heat Transfer in an Ericsson Engine Prototype |vauthors = Fula A, Stouffs P, Sierra F|date=22 March 2013 |publisher= |book-title= |pages= |location=Bilbao Spain |conference= International Conference on Renewable Energies and Power Quality (ICREPQ’13)|id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For medium and large engines the cost of valves can be small compared to this advantage. Turbocompressor plus turbine implementations seem favorable in the MWe range, positive displacement compressor plus turbine for Nx100&amp;nbsp;kWe power, and positive displacement compressor+expander below 100&amp;nbsp;kW. With high temperature [[hydraulic fluid]], both the compressor and the expander can be [[liquid ring pump]] even up to 400&amp;nbsp;°C, with rotating casing for best efficiency.

A [[Feed-in tariff]] is when payments are given by energy suppliers if a property or organisation generates their own electricity using technology such as solar panels or wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/feed-in-tariffs Feed-in Tariffs]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feed-in tariffs in the United Kingdom''' were announced in October 2008 and took effect from April 2010.&lt;ref name="renewableenergyworld.com"&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/07/britain-to-launch-innovative-feed-in-tariff-program-in-2010 Gipe, P, Britain to Launch Innovative Feed-in Tariff Program in 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; They were entered into law by the [[Energy Act 2008|Energy Act of 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/32/pdfs/ukpga_20080032_en.pdf UK Energy Act 2008] Accessed 14 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The Feed-In Tariff applies to small-scale generation of electricity using eligible renewable technologies. To encourage development of these technologies, feed-in tariffs pay the generator a certain amount even for energy which the generator themselves consumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feed-in Tariffs: get money for generating your own electricity|url=https://www.gov.uk/feed-in-tariffs/overview|publisher=Department of Energy and Climate Change|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electricity fed into the grid receives an additional export tariff, currently (June 2013) 4.5p per KWh. Costs for the programme are borne by all British electricity consumers proportionally: all consumers will bear a slight increase in their annual bill, thus allowing electricity utilities to pay the FIT for renewable electricity generated at the rates set by the government.  Payments through the mechanism are intended to replace the ROCs available through the [[Renewables Obligation]] for small-scale renewable energy generators and is based on a few key elements:

* The tariff is available only to renewable sources producing up to 5 MW power. Specific rates are set for different technologies and at different scales of installation for those technologies. Generators of renewable electricity larger than 5MW remain eligible to earn Renewables Obligation Certificates within the existing Renewables Obligation quota mechanism.  To prevent companies from moving large scale (for example big wind) projects from the ROCs to the Feed-in Tariff programme, a number of anti-gaming provisions have been inserted in the policy design; this should avoid the breaking up of bigger projects into several small ones, to fit within the 5 MW energy size cap.
* There are several other qualification requirements&lt;ref name=Eligibility&gt;{{cite web|title=Eligibility and tariffs|url=http://www.fitariffs.co.uk/eligible/|publisher=Feed-in Tariffs Limited|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including: certification under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme and the REAL Code for systems up to 50&amp;nbsp;kW; the use of specific metering standards; and systems being installed no earlier than July 2009. Energy efficiency requirements were added in March 2012 for buildings fitting PV systems under FITs.
* The contract term is 20 years, 25 years for solar photovoltaic projects: this means that, starting from 2010, British providers of Wind Energy, Hydropower, Energy from Biomass and Anaerobic Digestion eligible for the FiT scheme will be rewarded with a tariff rate guaranteed for the next 20 years - 25 years for Solar PV generators.
* The tariff made available to generators will be subject to degression.&lt;ref name=Degression&gt;{{cite web|title=Tariff degression|url=http://www.fitariffs.co.uk/FITs/principles/degression/|publisher=Feed-in Tariffs Limited|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the tariff level available for new generators will decrease annually. The rate of degression will vary by renewable energy technology. The price for individual renewable energy generating plants is fixed once the plant becomes operational.
* Costs for the programme will be paid by the energy suppliers. It should be expected that the suppliers will pass on the cost to their electricity customers:&lt;ref name=Funding&gt;{{cite web|title=Who pays for the FITs|url=http://www.fitariffs.co.uk/FITs/principles/funding/|publisher=Feed-in Tariffs Limited|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; consumers will bear an increase in their annual bill, thus allowing electricity utilities to pay the "Feed-in" Tariff to renewable energy generators at the rates set by the government.

The government estimated that feed-in tariffs to support small-scale low-carbon generation would cost £8.6 billion up to 2030 and produce monetised carbon savings worth £0.42 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/Consultations/Renewable%20Electricity%20Financial%20Incentives/1_20100204103559_e_@@_FITsImpactAssessmentaccompanyingGovernmentResponse.pdf Impact Assessment of Feed-in Tariffs for Small-Scale, Low Carbon, Electricity Generation (URN10D/536)], February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Feed-in-Tariff payments are Tax-free in the UK.&lt;ref name="H2-ecO"&gt;{{cite web|title=H2-ecO|url=http://www.h2-eco.co.uk|website=h2-eco.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Year one feedback==
A new study from the University of London has assessed the first year of the UK FIT scheme through interviews with both users of the scheme and government figures. The key findings are that users have had a wide variety of experiences, depending on the technology they are working with, and that the government has very limited ambitions on small-scale renewable energy generation.

Domestic solar has performed well in the first year, with 28,028 of the 28,614 total solar installations (totalling nearly 78MW). Wind power has the next highest installation level with 1,348 (20.4MW). Small hydro had 206 (12.1MW), although many were not new installations, but had been transferred from the [[Renewables Obligation|Renewable Obligation]] scheme. Micro-[[Cogeneration|CHP]] had 98 installations (0.09MW), and [[Anaerobic digestion|Anaerobic Digestion]] (AD) had just 2 (0.66MW). AD is under scrutiny at present (April 2011) to determine why development has been so poor.

The study suggests that technologies have a variety of factors affecting their performance in terms of installation levels. The factors include cost, size, availability, standardisation of the technology, planning issues, ease of installation, perceived sensory impact (sight, sound and smell) and administrative complexity. Domestic PV scores very positively on all these factors, while small hydro and AD do far less well.

The proposed changes to the tariff levels for PV have been met with anger by many in the solar industry, but the FIT policy, along with the [[Green Investment Bank]] and now carbon reduction targets, are widely understood to be threatened by the Treasury department. This is due to the schemes being considered as liabilities on the national balance sheet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/geds/downloads/UKFIT.pdf Mendonca, M., 2011.

Less than a year into the scheme, in March 2011 the new [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition Government]] announced that support for large-scale [[photovoltaic]] installations (greater than 50&amp;nbsp;kW) would be cut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbang.com/feed-in-tariff-cut-shocks-uk-pv-market_17123.html Feed-in tariff cut shocks UK PV market] ''greenbang.com'', published 2011-03-18, accessed 2011-03-29&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 August 2011 the rate for installations over 50&amp;nbsp;kW was to range from 19p/kWh to 8.5p/kWh for the largest qualifying installations (5MW), with the Government claiming that this would prevent the scheme from becoming 'overwhelmed'.&lt;ref name="DECC-11-06-09"&gt;[http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn11_046/pn11_046.aspx New Feed-in Tariff Levels For Large Scale Solar and Anaerobic Digestion Announced Today] [[Department of Energy and Climate Change|DECC]] published 2011-06-09, accessed 2011-06-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Revised tariffs for [[farm]]-scale [[anaerobic digestion]] initially of either 14p/kWh or 13p/kWh,&lt;ref name=Tariff_Table&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitariffs.co.uk/eligible/levels/|title=Tariff Levels Table |publisher=Feed-in Tariffs Ltd |date= |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the installation size, were introduced from September 2011.&lt;ref name="DECC-11-06-09" /&gt;

On 31 October 2011 a second review of the Feed in Tariffs for low carbon electricity generation was announced which is likely to take effect from 12 December 2011. The rates for small photovoltaic installations have been reduced from 43.3p/kWh to 21 pence/kWh. The reason for the second review is that FITs for PV were being taken up too quickly and that the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change|DECC]] funding allocation for FITs was in danger of being exceeded. A further reason is that the cost of installing PV panels has reduced by around 50% and therefore the FITs had become less of an encouragement to install PV panels and more of an incitement to profit from excessive subsidies. See revised tariff tables for FITs.&lt;ref name=Tariff_Table /&gt;

==Reviews to feed-in tariff rates in 2012==

In its second year, the government announced further cuts to the FIT scheme. On 3 March  the tariff was cut to 21p/kWh. This cut was originally scheduled for 12 December 2011 but was delayed, following a successful joint appeal to the High Court by [[Friends of the Earth]] and two solar companies, Solar Century and HomeSun.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/23/uk-government-solar-feed-in-tariff UK government loses solar feed-in tariff bid]"guardian.com", published 2012-03-18 accessed 2013-05-15&lt;/ref&gt; The 1 August review of the FIT brought an additional cut to 16p/kWh. The cut was partnered with a rise in export rate (the price at which the homeowner can sell excess electricity back to the supplier) from 3.1p to 4.5p for every kWh of electricity exported to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Sustainability/Environment/fits/Pages/fits.aspx Feed-in Tariffs]"Ofgem", Retrieved 2013-05-14&lt;/ref&gt; The latest cut came into effect on 1 November, the tariff dropping to 15.44p/kWh, and this rate is set to remain until 1 February 2013. In addition to this, generators with more than 25 Solar PV installations were granted a 10% increase in the amount they receive of the FIT, from 80% to 90%, this however will not be likely to affect domestic users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/how-much-do-solar-panels-cost-uk#3 Feed-in tariff – what % is the ROI?]"theecoexperts.co.uk", retrieved 2013-05-14&lt;/ref&gt; The cut in FITs was due to the falling installation costs, and the fact that people were applying for the feed-in tariff scheme in numbers exceeding DECC forecasts and funding allocations. The aforementioned rates would only affect new installations - existing schemes would not be affected . The new tariffs would also now be paid over 20 years instead of 25 years (It will remain linked to the [[Retail Price Index]])  with a review every three months based on solar PV uptake levels in the three different bands: domestic (size 0-10&amp;nbsp;kW), small commercial (10-50&amp;nbsp;kW) and large commercial (above 50&amp;nbsp;kW and standalone installations).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/feed-in-tariffs/overview Feed-in Tariffs: get money for generating your own electricity]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite suggestions that the European solar market is in decline, a report &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessgreen.com/digital_assets/6533/PVPS_trends_snapshot_2012_(2).pdf PVPS Report  A Snapshot of Global PV 1992-2012]"buisinessgreen.com", Retrieved 2013-05-14&lt;/ref&gt;  by the [[International Energy Agency]] has shown that for a second year in a row solar PV was the dominant form of new electricity installation during 2012, ahead of both wind and gas power.

==Reviews to feed-in tariff rates in 2018==
The Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published a consultation on 19 July 2018. In this, they state their intention to close the FIT scheme to new applicants from 1 April 2019&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-programmes/fit/about-fit-scheme About the FIT scheme]&lt;/ref&gt; and will not be replaced by a new subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jojusolar.co.uk/2018/08/08/renewable-energy-news-july-2018/ FiT changes on the way]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related schemes==
In addition to the feed-in tariff, a similar incentive - the [[Renewable Heat Incentive]] for [[renewable heat]] was introduced in November 2011.

==Free solar==

The scheme has created a number of start-up companies providing free electricity &lt;ref&gt;http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/Solar-electricity/Consumer-guidance-on-free-solar-PV-offers&lt;/ref&gt; in return for installing solar panels on the homeowner's roof. If the homeowner can not afford the capital outlay, the free solar companies offer a capital-free way of getting the benefits of solar and free electricity. However, if the homeowner can afford the capital outlay it is more cost effective to purchase the solar equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/property/article-1309252/MARKET-WATCH-Solar-panels-fit-prince-beware-free-offers.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Sebastian O | last=Kelly | title=Solar panels are fit for a prince, but beware 'free' offers | date=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; directly.

After the December 2015 Feed-in Tariff reductions were announced, many free solar panel installers have started to cease trading, or have plans to stop installing, as the returns are no longer financially viable. The change in the feed-in tariff will equate to a 64% decrease in the generation tariff for solar arrays less than 4&amp;nbsp;kW, which is the largest decrease since the scheme was started in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.solarpanels.cheap/feed-in-tariff-fit-scheme Current Feed-in Tariff Rates - 2016 Decrease]"SolarPanels.cheap", accessed 2016-02-02&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, the feed-in tariff changes will mean that larger systems (over 10&amp;nbsp;kW) will receive higher feed in tariff rate than smaller domestic sized systems, which could result in a strong switch of the remaining free solar panel companies to exclusively providing commercial installations.

==Unfair treatment==

There has been much criticism of the tariffs as being inconsistent. Those people who installed equipment before the FIT started, are given a fixed tariff of 9p per unit (9.9p from April 2012&lt;ref name=Tariff_Table /&gt; ). Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats pledged to reverse this in the 2010 General Election, but then reneged on this decision afterwards. The pioneers are now on a lower rate than that before FITs started, despite generating the same electricity.

There has also been criticism of the high rates for FITs compared to those for the [[Renewable Heat Incentive]]: the renewable heat technologies are more economic than renewable electricity generation so the government could save carbon much less expensively by increasing the RHI on ground source heat pumps (originally at 4.5 pence/kWh, but raised to 8.7 pence/kWh in 2014) compared to the tariffs for photovoltaic (originally up to 41.3 pence/kWh, but reduced to 14 by 2014) or the tariffs for wind turbines (originally up to 34.5 pence/kWh, but reduced to 18 by 2014).

The '''Gorlov helical turbine''' (GHT) is a [[water turbine]] evolved from the [[Darrieus wind turbine|Darrieus turbine]] design by altering it to have [[Helix|helical]] blades/foils. It was patented in a series of patents from September 19, 1995&lt;ref &gt;''A.M. Gorlov'', [http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=g8kjAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=ininventor:Gorlov&amp;as_drrb_ap=q&amp;as_minm_ap=0&amp;as_miny_ap=&amp;as_maxm_ap=0&amp;as_maxy_ap=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=10 Unidirectional helical reaction turbine operable under reversible fluid flow for power systems], [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN%2F5451137 United States Patent 5,451,137], Sept. 19, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  to July 3, 2001&lt;ref&gt;''A.M.

Gorlov]] of [[Northeastern University]].

The physical principles of the GHT work&lt;ref&gt;''M.J. Khan, G. Bhuyan, M.T. Iqbal,  and J.E. Quaicoe'', [http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306261909000713 Hydrokinetic energy conversion systems and assessment of horizontal and vertical axis turbines for river and tidal applications: A technology status review], Applied Energy, Volume 86, Issue 10, October 2009, Pages 1823-1835. {{doi|10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.02.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the same as for its main prototype, the Darrieus turbine, and for the family of similar [[Vertical axis wind turbine]]s which includes also [[Turby wind turbine]], aerotecture turbine, [[Quietrevolution wind turbine]], ... GHT, turby and quietrevolution solved pulsatory [[torque]] issues by using the helical twist of the blades.

==Fluid performance==
The term "foil" is used to describe the shape of the blade cross-section at a given point, with no distinction for the type of fluid, (thus referring to either an "[[airfoil]]" or "[[hydrofoil]]").  In the helical design, the blades curve around the axis, which has the effect of evenly distributing the foil sections throughout the rotation cycle, so there is always a foil section at every possible [[angle of attack]].  In this way, the sum of the lift and drag forces on each blade do not change abruptly with rotation angle.  The turbine generates a smoother torque curve, so there is much less vibration and noise than in the Darrieus design.  It also minimizes peak stresses in the structure and materials, and facilitates self-starting of the turbine.  In testing environments the GHT has been observed to have up to 35% efficiency in energy capture reported by several groups.&lt;ref &gt;''Gorlov, A. M.'', 1998, Helical turbines for the Gulf Stream, Marine Technology, 35, No 3, pp. 175–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Alexander Nikolaevich Gorban|Gorban' A.N.]], Gorlov A.M., Silantyev V.M.'', [http://www.math.le.ac.uk/people/ag153/homepage/Gorlov2001.pdf Limits of the Turbine Efficiency for Free Fluid Flow], Journal of Energy Resources Technology - December 2001 - Volume 123, Issue 4, pp. 311-317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Han, Sang-Hun; Lee, Kwang-Soo; Yum, Ki-Dai; Park, Woo-Sun; Park, Jin-Soon,'' Evaluation of helical turbine efficiency for tidal current power plant based on in-situ experiment, Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Asian and Pacific Coasts, Singapore, Oct  13-18, 2009, Vol 4, 315-321.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Among the other vertical-axis turbine systems, the Davis Hydro turbine, the EnCurrent turbine, and the Gorlov Helical turbine have all undergone scale testing at laboratory or sea. Overall, these technologies represent the current norm of tidal current development."&lt;ref&gt;J. Khan and G. Bhuyan (2009). [http://www.iea-oceans.org/_fich/6/ANNEX_1_Doc_T0104.pdf Ocean Energy: Global Technology Development Status], Report prepared by Powertech Labs for the IEA-OES. [Online], Available: www.iea-oceans.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turbine axis-orientation==
The main difference between the Gorlov helical turbine and conventional turbines is the orientation of the axis in relation to current flow.  The GHT is a [[vertical-axis wind turbine|vertical-axis turbine]] which means the axis is positioned perpendicular to current flow, whereas traditional turbines are [[Wind_turbine#Horizontal_axis|horizontal-axis turbine]]s which means the axis is positioned parallel to the flow of the current.  Fluid flows, such as wind, will naturally change direction, however they will still remain parallel to the ground.  So in all vertical-axis turbines, the flow remains perpendicular to the axis, regardless of the flow direction, and the turbines always rotate in the same direction.   This is one of the main advantages of vertical-axis turbines.

If the direction of the water flow is fixed, then the Gorlov turbine axis could be vertical or horizontal, the only requirement is orthogonality to the flow.&lt;ref name="GorlovReport1998"&gt;''Gorlov A.M.'', [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/666280-D6NWM1/webviewable/666280.pdf Development of the helical reaction hydraulic turbine]. Final Technical Report, The US Department of Energy, August 1998, The Department of Energy's (DOE) [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/ Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airfoil / hydrofoil==
The GHT operates under a [[Lift (force)|lift]]-based concept (see [[airfoil]]).  The foil sections on the GHT are symmetrical, both top-to-bottom and also from the leading-to-trailing edge.  The GHT can actually spin equally well in either direction.  The GHT works under the same principle as the Darrieus turbine; that is, it relies upon the movement of the foils in order to change the apparent direction of the flow relative to the foils, and thus change the (apparent) "angle of attack" of the foil.

==Environmental issues==
A GHT is proposed&lt;ref name="GorlovReport1998"/&gt; for [[Low head hydro power|low-head]] [[micro hydro]] installations, when construction of a [[dam]] is undesirable.  The GHT is an example of [[damless hydro]] technology.  The technology may potentially offer cost and environmental benefits over dam-based micro-hydro systems.

Some advantages of damless hydro are that it eliminates the potential for failure of a dam, which improves public safety. It also eliminates the initial cost of dam engineering, construction and maintenance, reduces the environmental and ecological complications, and potentially simplifies the regulatory issues put into law specifically to mitigate the problems with dams.

In general, a major ecological issue with hydropower installations is their actual and perceived risk to aquatic life. It is claimed that a GHT spins slowly enough that fish can see it soon enough to swim around it.&lt;ref&gt;''Davis Jill'', [http://www.nrdc.org/OnEarth/05spr/gorlov1.asp Alexander's Marvelous Machine], OnEarth, Spring 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Petkewich Rachel'',  [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es0403716 Technology Solutions: Creating electricity with undammed hydropower], Environ. Sci. Technol., 2004, 38 (3), pp 55A–56A, {{doi|10.1021/es0403716}}&lt;/ref&gt; From preliminary tests in 2001, it was claimed that if a fish swims between the slowly moving turbine blades, the fish will not be harmed.  Also it would be difficult for a fish to become lodged or stuck in the turbine, because the open spaces between the blades are larger than even the largest fish living in a small river. A fish also would not be tumbled around in a [[vortex]], because the GHT does not create a lot of turbulence, so small objects would be harmlessly swept through with the current.

==How it works==

|-
|}
{{clear}}
In this example the direction of the fluid flow is to the left.  &lt;br /&gt;
As the turbine rotates, in this case in a clockwise direction, the motion of the foil through the fluid changes the [[Apparent wind|apparent velocity]] and [[angle of attack]] (speed and direction) of the fluid with respect to the [[frame of reference]] of the foil.  The combined effect of these two flow components (i.e. the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] sum), yields the net total "Apparent flow velocity" as shown in the next figure.

{| style="float:left"
|-

| [[Image:GHT Figure 4.png|thumb|240px|Net force vectors.]]
|-
|}
{{clear}}
The action of this apparent flow on each foil section generates both a [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]] force, the sum of which is shown in the figure above titled "Net force vectors".  Each of these net force vectors can be split into two orthogonal vectors: a radial component and a tangential component, shown here as "Normal force" and "Axial force" respectively.  The normal forces are opposed by the rigidity of the turbine structure and do not impart any rotational force or energy to the turbine.  The remaining force component propels the turbine in the clockwise direction, and it is from this [[torque]] that energy can be harvested.

[With regards to the figure above left "Apparent flow velocity...", Lucid Energy Technologies, rights holder to the patent to the Gorlov Helical Turbine, notes that this diagram, with no apparent velocity at an azimuth angle of 180 degrees (blade at its point in rotation where it is instantaneously moving in downstream direction), may be subject to misinterpretation.  This is because a zero apparently flow velocity could occur only at a tip speed ratio of unity (i.e. TSR=1, where the current flow induced by rotation equals the current flow).  The GHT generally operates at a TSR substantially greater than unity.]

(The diagrams "Net Force Vectors" and "Normal Force Vectors" are partially incorrect.  The downwind segments should show the vectors outside the circles.  Otherwise there would be no net sideways loading on the turbine.)  M Koester 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2565">The '''Institute of Chartered Foresters''' is the professional body for [[forester]]s and [[arboriculturists]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Its [[Royal Charter]] was granted in 1982. The Institute grants Chartered status to individuals following an examination process that includes a period of management or supervisory experience. Members are recognised by their titles 'Chartered Arboriculturist' or 'Chartered Forester' and by the letters '''MICFor'''(Member of the Institute of Chartered Foresters). Fellows of the institute bear the title '''FICFor'''.

Members of the Institute of Chartered Foresters are required to undertake Continuous Professional Development (CPD) and are bound by a Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. ICF's membership is currently over 1,400.

ICF is also involved in raising awareness of issues facing forestry sector professionals and providing guidance to professionals from other sectors, and the public, in relation to these issues.

== Membership Grades ==

There are [http://www.charteredforesters.org/membership/ 5 membership grades] at the Institute of Chartered Foresters, as follows

* Student Member - those who are studying either full-time or part-time in higher education.
* Associate Member - those who have completed their initial professional education and would like to work towards Chartered status.
* Professional Member - Recognises members' technical and professional competence and confers Chartered status.
* Fellowship - this is awarded to senior members of ICF recognising their expertise and particular contribution to the profession.
* Supporter - this is open to individuals with an interest in forestry and arboriculture, but who are not necessarily working towards Chartered status.

== ICF National Conference ==

The ICF National conference takes place annually, attracting both members and non-members. In 2011, and again in 2014 the Institute hosted the [http://www.charteredforesters.org/icf-events/icf-national-conference/ Trees, People and the Built Environment] (TPBE) event as their National Conference. TPBE is a partnership event of some 20 UK forestry, arboriculture and built environment organisations, which presents urban trees research from around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12433">In the [[Petroleum industry]], '''Integrated operations''' (IO) refers to the integration of people, disciplines, organizations, work processes and [[information and communication technology]] to make smarter decisions. In short, IO is collaboration with focus on production.

==Contents of the term==
The most striking part of IO has been the use of always-on videoconference rooms between offshore platforms and land-based offices. This includes broadband connections for sharing of data and video-surveillance of the platform. This has made it possible to move some personnel onshore and use the existing human resources more efficiently. Instead of having e.g. an expert in geology on duty at every platform, the expert may be stationed on land and be available for consultation for several offshore platforms. 
It's also possible for a team at an office in a different time zone to be consulting the night-shift of the platform, so that no land-based workers need work at night.

Splitting the team between land and sea demands new work processes, which together with ICT is the two main focus points for IO. Tools like videoconferencing and 3D-visualization also creates an opportunity for new, more cross-discipline cooperations. For instance, a shared 3D-visualization may be tailored to each member of the group, so that the geologist gets a visualization of the geological structures while the drilling engineer focuses on visualizing the well. Here, real-time measurements from the well are important but the downhole bandwidth has previously been very restricted. Improvements in bandwidth, better measurement devices, better aggregation and visualization of this information and improved models that simulate the rock formations and wellbore currently all feed on each other. An important task where all these improvements play together is real-time production optimization.

In the process industry in general, the term is used to describe the increased cooperation, independent of location, between operators, maintenance personnel, electricians, production management as well as business management and suppliers to provide a more streamlined plant operation.

By deploying IO, the petroleum industry draws on lessons from the process industry. This can be seen in a larger focus on the whole production chain and management ideas imported from the production and process industry. A prominent idea in this regard is real-time [[Process optimization|optimization]] of the whole value chain, from long term management of the [[oil reservoir]], through capacity allocations in pipe networks and calculations of the net present value of the produced oil. Reviews of the application of Integrated Operations can be found in papers presented in the by-annual society of petroleum engineers Intelligent Energy conferences. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-128669-MS?sort=&amp;start=0&amp;q=128669&amp;from_year=&amp;peer_reviewed=&amp;published_between=&amp;fromSearchResults=true&amp;to_year=&amp;rows=10#|title = The Art of Intelligent Energy(iE) - Insights and Lessons Learned from the application of iE|date = 2010|accessdate = https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-128669-MS?sort=&amp;start=0&amp;q=128669&amp;from_year=&amp;peer_reviewed=&amp;published_between=&amp;fromSearchResults=true&amp;to_year=&amp;rows=10#|website = |publisher = Society of Petroleum Engineers|last = Edwards|first = Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A focus on the whole production chain is also seen in debates about how to organize people in an IO organisation, with frequent calls for breaking down the [[Information silo]]s in the oil companies. A large oil company is typically organized in [[functional silo]]s corresponding to disciplines such as [[Oil drilling#Drilling|drilling]], [[Oil drilling#Production|production]] and [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] management. This is regarded as inefficient by the IO movement, pointing out that the activities in any well or field by any of the silos will involve or affect all of the others. 
While some companies focus on their inhouse management structure, others also emphasize the integration and coordination of outside suppliers and collaborators in offshore-operations. For instance, it is pointed out that the oil and gas industry is lagging behind other industries in terms of [[Operational intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Brulé - Digital Energy Journal sep09 p22 www.digitalenergyjournal.com/issues/DEJ20web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas and theories that IO management and work processes build on will be familiar from [[operations research]], [[knowledge management]] and [[continual improvement]] as well as [[information systems]] and [[business transformation]]. This is perhaps most evident in the repeated referral to "people, process and technology"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.integrated-operations.co.uk/ "Integrated Operations is about ensuring people, processes and technology work much more efficiently together"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intelligentenergyevent.com/page.cfm/Link=65/t=m/goSection=16 "the 3 inter-related categories of:
People, process and organisational change; Technology and data; Case studies"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.touchoilandgas.com/distance-nothing-operation-everything-a143-1.html "The Third Efficiency Leap – Focus on People, Process and Technology"&lt;/ref&gt; in IO discussions
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalio.com/what-is-io/ "Achieving a high performing IO program requires four fundamental building blocks:Transformational Leadership, Right People, Business Processes and Technology"&lt;/ref&gt;. As bullet-points this mirror many of the aforementioned fields.

Since 2010 major mining companies have become implementers of Integrated Operations, most notable Rio Tinto, BHP Biliton and Codelco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176814-MS|title = Integrated Operations (IO) in Mining and Oil and Gas, What can we learn from each other?|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = OnePetro|publisher = Society of Petroleum Engineers|last = Edwards|first = Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Incentives==
Common to most companies is that IO leads to cost savings as fewer people are stationed offshore and an increased efficiency. Lower costs, more efficient reservoir management and fewer mistakes during well drilling will in turn raise profits and make more oil fields economically viable. IO comes at a time when the oil industry is faced with more "brown fields", also referred to as "tail production", where the cost of extracting the oil will be higher than its market value, unless major improvements in technology and work processes are made.
It has been estimated that deployment of IO could produce 300 billion NOK of added value to the Norwegian continental shelf alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tu.no/olje-gass/article138103.ece&lt;/ref&gt; On a longer time-scale, working onshore control and monitoring of the oil production may become a necessity as new fields at deeper waters are based purely on unmanned sub-sea facilities.

Moving jobs onshore has also been touted as a way to keep and make better use of an [[Aging U.S. Workforce|aging workforce]], which is regarded as a challenge by western oil and gas companies. As the average age of the industry workforce is increasing with many nearing retirement, IO is being leveraged for knowledge sharing and training of younger workforce. More comfortable onshore jobs together with "high-tech" tools has also been fronted as a way to recruit young workers into an industry that is seen as "unsexy", "lowtech" and difficult to combine with a normal family life.

==Critique==
The security aspect of reducing the offshore workforce has been raised. Will on-site experience be lost and can familiarity with the platform and its processes be attained from an onshore office? The new working environment in any case demands changes to HSE routines. Some of the challenges also include clear role and responsibility definitions and clarifications between the onshore &amp; offshore personnel. Who in a given situation has the authority to take decisions, the onsite or the offshore staff. The increased integration of the offshore facilities with the onshore office environment and outside collaborators also expose work-critical ICT-infrastructure to the internet and the hazards of everyday ICT. 
As for the efficiency aspect, some criticize the onshore-offshore collaboration for creating a more bureaucratic working environment.

==Naming conventions==
Both the exact terms and the content used to describe IO vary between companies. The oil company [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] has traditionally branded the term '''Smart Fields''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shell.com/home/content/innovation/meeting_demand/getting_more/smartfields/smartfields.html&lt;/ref&gt; which was an extension of '''Smart Wells''' that only referred to remote-controlled well-valves. [[BP]] uses '''Field of the future'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9025118&amp;contentId=7047802&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/bp-and-technology/more-recovery/real-time-data-and-decisions/field-of-the-future.html&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to its innovations in oil production. Chevron has '''i-field''', Honeywell has [http://www.honeywellprocess.com/en-US/explore/solutions/industry-solutions/oil-and-gas/off-shore-production/Pages/digital-suites-oil-gas.aspx '''Digital Suites for Oil and Gas'''] (a set of software and services), and [[Schlumberger]] terms it '''Digital Energy'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slb.com/content/news/inside/2009/20090507_digital_energy.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The latter term, understood as referring to oil and gas, is adopted in the title of the [[digital energy journal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalenergyjournal.com/&lt;/ref&gt; This term could have several meanings, as [[GE Enterprise Solutions|GE Digital Energy]] for instance, do not appear to use it in the IO sense.

Other terms include '''e-Field''', '''i-Field''', '''Digital Oilfield''', '''Intelligent Oilfield''', '''Field of the future''' and '''Intelligent Energy'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epmag.com/archives/everyMonth/6264.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated operations has been the preferred term by [[Statoil]], the [[Norwegian Oil Industry Association]] (OLF), a professional body and employer's association for oil and supplier companies&lt;ref&gt;Letter from the editor, Digital Energy Journal April/May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forskningsradet.ravn.no/bibliotek/forskning/200604/200604008.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825175106/http://forskningsradet.ravn.no/bibliotek/forskning/200604/200604008.html |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and vendors such as [[ABB Group|ABB]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abb.no/industries/us/9AAC167609.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; IO is also the preferred term for Petrobras.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/integrated-operations-petrobras/68719&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligent Energy is the dominant term in publications revolving around the biannual SPE Intelligent Energy conference,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intelligentenergyevent.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which has been one of the major conferences for the IO movement, along with the annual IO Science and Practice conference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ioconf.no/2010/doku.php&lt;/ref&gt; which obviously supports the IO term.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2031">'''JASO M345''' is a quality classification standard for [[two stroke]] [[engine oil]]s for [[engines]] of [[Japan]]ese origin. It was introduced by the [[Japanese Automotive Standards Organization]] (JASO) in 1994 as JASO M345-93 with the quality levels JASO FA, JASO FB and JASO FC – with FC setting the highest standard. It was revised in 2004 as JASO M345:2004 which discontinued the FA level, and introduced the new JASO FD level – the FD level supersedes JASO FC as the highest rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lubrizol.com/MCEO/Spec-Check/JASO-M345-Two-Stroke.html |title=Two-stroke motorcycle oils - JASO M345 standard |date= |website=www.mceo.com |publisher=The Lubrizol Corporation |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The different quality levels set requirements with regard to properties such as minimum [[lubricant|lubrication]], minimum [[detergent|detergency]], maximum smoke and maximum deposits. A two stroke engine oil is granted the official [[JASO]] seal if it has been independently tested. The seal is a rectangle; in the upper quarter of the rectangle will be a serial number, and the lower three quarters will just have the letters FB, FC or FD.

== Overview ==
'''JASO FA''' – original spec established regulating lubricity, detergency, initial torque, exhaust smoke and exhaust system blocking.

'''JASO FB''' – improved requirements over FA with regard to lubricity, detergency, exhaust smoke and exhaust system blocking.

'''JASO FC''' – lubricity and initial torque requirements same as FB, however far higher requirements over FB with regard to detergency, exhaust smoke and exhaust system blocking.

'''JASO FD''' - same as FC, except with far higher detergency requirement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11958">[[File:PoleMountedDistributionTransformerNZ.jpg|thumb|right|A pole-mounted three-phase distribution transformer. Low-voltage feeders distributing power to households are placed below the transformer]]

A '''low-voltage network''' or '''secondary network''' is a part of [[electric power distribution]] which carries electric energy from [[distribution transformer]]s to [[electricity meter]]s of end customers. Secondary networks are operated at a [[low voltage]] level, which is typically equal to the [[mains voltage]] of electric appliances.

Most modern secondary networks are operated at [[alternating current|AC]] rated voltage of 100–127 or 220–240&amp;nbsp;[[volts]], at the frequency of 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;[[hertz]] (see [[mains electricity by country]]). Operating voltage, required number of phases ([[three-phase]] or [[single-phase]]) and required reliability dictate topology and configuration of the network. The simplest form are radial [[service drop]] lines from the transformer to the customer premises. Low-voltage radial feeders supply multiple customers. For increased reliability, so-called ''spot networks'' and ''grid networks'' provide supply of customers from multiple distribution transformers and supply paths. [[Electric wiring]] can be realized by [[overhead power line]]s, [[aerial bundled cable|aerial]] or underground [[power cable]]s, or their mixture.

==Overview==
[[File:Elektroměrový_rozvaděč_PER_2.JPG|thumb|A house cable connection cabinet equipped with a meter, a [[time switch]] and a [[circuit breaker]]]]

[[Electric power distribution]] systems are designed to serve their customers with reliable and high-quality power. The most common distribution system consists of  simple radial circuits (feeders) that can be overhead, underground, or a combination. From the [[distribution substation]], feeders carry the power to the end customers, forming the ''medium-voltage'' or ''primary'' network, operated at a [[medium voltage]] level, typically 5–35&amp;nbsp;kV. Feeders range in length from a few kilometers to several tens of kilometers. As they must supply all customers in the designated distribution area, they often curve and branch along the assigned corridors.{{sfn|Warne|2005|p=385}}{{sfn|NREL|2005|p=1}} A substation typically supplies 3–30 feeders.{{citation needed||date=September 2017}}

[[Distribution transformer]]s or ''secondary transformers'', placed along feeders, convert the voltage from the medium to a [[low voltage]] level, suitable for direct consumption by end customers ([[mains voltage]]).{{sfn|Beaty|1998|p=84}} Typically, a rural primary feeder supplies up to 50 distribution transformers, spread over a wide region,{{sfn|Warne|2005|p=387}} but the figure significantly varies depending on configuration. They are sited on pole tops, cellars or designated small plots.{{sfn|NREL|2005|p=1}} From these transformers, ''low-voltage'' or ''secondary'' network branches off to the customer connections at customer premises, equipped with [[electricity meter]]s.{{sfn|Beaty|1998|p=84}}

==Design considerations==
{{multiple image
|align=right
|direction=horizontal
|width=250
|header=Typical layouts of European (left) and North American (right) distribution system
|image1=European Distribution System.svg
|image2=American Distribution System.svg
}}
Most of differences in the layout and design of low-voltage networks are dictated by the [[mains voltage]] rating. In Europe and most of the world 220–240&amp;nbsp;V is the dominant choice, while in North America 120&amp;nbsp;V is the standard.{{sfn|Warne|2005|p=23}}

ANSI standard C84.1 recommends a +5%, −2.5% tolerance for the voltage range at a service point.{{sfn|ANSI|2011}} North American LV networks feature much shorter secondary connections, up to {{convert|250|ft|sigfig=1}}, while in European design they can reach up to {{convert|1|mi|m|sigfig=2}}. North American distribution transformers must be therefore placed much closer to consumers, and are smaller (25–50 kVA), while European ones can cover larger areas and thus have higher ratings (300–1000 kVA); only the remote rural areas in European design are served by single-phase transformers.{{sfn|Warne|2005|p=23}}

As the low-voltage distribute the electric power to the widest class of end users, another main design concern is safety of consumers who use the electric appliances and their protection against electric shocks. An [[earthing system]], in combination with protective devices such as [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]] and [[residual current device]]s, must ultimately ensure that a person must not come into touch with a metallic object whose potential relative to the person's potential (which is, in turn, equal to the ground potential unless [[insulating mat]]s are used) exceeds a "safe" threshold, typically set at about 50&amp;nbsp;V.

==Topology==
===Radial networks===
[[File:Radial Networks.svg|thumb|Typical layouts of radial low-voltage networks]]

Radial operation is the most widespread and most economic design of both MV and LV networks.It provides a sufficiently high degree of reliability and service continuity for most customers.{{sfn|Loyd|2004|p=18}}  In American (120&amp;nbsp;V) systems, the customers are commonly supplied directly from the distribution transformers via relatively short [[service drop]] lines, in star-like topology. In 240&amp;nbsp;V systems, the customers are served by several low-voltage feeders, realized by [[overhead power line]]s, [[aerial bundled cable|aerial]] or underground [[power cable]]s, or their mixture; in an overhead network, service drops are drawn from pole tops to roof connections. In a cable network, all necessary connections and protection devices are typically placed in pad-mounted cabinets or, occasionally, manholes (buried T-joint connections are prone to failures).

[[File:FS-TrafoSt.JPG|thumb|left||Low-voltage side switching cabinet of a European MV/LV substation. Four LV cable feeders equipped with circuit breakers featured.]]

[[Power-system protection]] in radial networks is simple to design and implement, since short-circuit currents have only one possible path that needs to be interrupted. [[Fuse (electrical)|Fuses]] are most commonly used for both short-circuit and overload protection, while low-voltage [[circuit breaker]]s may be used in special circumstances.

===Spot networks===
[[File:Spot Network.svg|thumb|Layout of a spot low-voltage network]]
{{main|Spot network substation}}
Spot networks are used when increased reliability of supply is required for important customers. The low-voltage network is supplied from two or more distribution transformers at a single site, each fed from a different MV feeder (which may originate from the same or different substations). The transformers are connected together with a bus or a cable on secondary side, termed ''paralleling bus'' or ''collector bus''. The paralleling bus typically does not have connecting cables (''reaches'') to other network units, in which case such networks are termed ''isolating spot networks''; when they have, they are referred to as ''spot networks with reach''. In some cases, fast-acting secondary bus tie  breakers may be applied between bus sections to isolate faults in the secondary switchgear and limit loss of service.{{sfn|NREL|2005|pp=6–8}}

Spot systems are commonly applied in high load-density areas such as business districts, large hospitals, small industry and important facilities such as water supply systems.{{sfn|NREL|2005|pp=6–8}} In normal operation, the energy supply is provided by both primary feeders in parallel. In case of an outage of either primary feeder, [[network protector]] device at the corresponding spot transformer secondary automatically opens; the remaining transformers continue to provide supply through their respective primary feeders. Only in cases when the [[short circuit]] is located at the paralleling bus, or a total loss of primary supply occurs, the customer will remain out of service. Faults on the low-voltage network are handled by fuses or local circuit breakers, resulting in loss of service only for the affected loads.{{sfn|NREL|2005|pp=6-8}}

===Grid networks===
[[File:Grid Network.svg|thumb|Layout of a grid low-voltage network]]
A grid networks consist of an interconnected grid of circuits, energized from several primary feeders through distribution transformers at multiple locations. Grid networks are typically featured in downtowns of large cities, with connecting cables laid out in underground conduits along the streets. Numerous cables allow for multiple current paths from every transformer to every load within the grid.{{sfn|NREL|2005|p=9}}

As with spot networks, network protectors are used to protect against primary feeder faults, and prevent fault current to propagate from the grid to the primary feeder.{{sfn|NREL|2005|p=7}} Individual cable sections may be protected by [[cable limiter]]s on both ends, special fuses providing very fast short-circuit protection. Cable limiters do not have an ampere rating, and cannot be used to provide overload protection; their sole purpose is to isolate the fault. Under high short-circuit conditions, limiters blow and cut off the faulted cable, while the unaffected cables take over its load and continue to provide service.{{sfn|Kussy|1986|p=298}} Primary feeder outages, as well as limiters and network protectors cleared because of previous faults, cause changes in load flow that are not readily detected, so their statuses may require a periodic inspection. The inherent system redundancy generally prevents any customer from experiencing outage.{{sfn|NREL|2005|p=10}}

'''Magnesium sulfate''' is an [[inorganic]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] with the formula MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; where 0≤x≤7. It is often encountered as the heptahydrate [[sulfate mineral]] [[epsomite]] (MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), commonly called '''Epsom salt'''. The overall global annual usage in the mid-1970s of the monohydrate was 2.3 million tons, of which the majority was used in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Inorganic Chemistry, Karl Heinz Büchel, Hans-Heinrich Moretto, Dietmar Werner, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2d edition, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-527-61333-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epsom salt has been traditionally used as a component of [[bath salts]]. Epsom salt can also be used as a beauty product. Athletes use it to soothe sore muscles, while gardeners use it to improve crops. It has a variety of other uses: for example, Epsom salt is also effective in the removal of splinters.&lt;ref name="WSJ-Decarbo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303302504577327722133289222.html |title=Quick Cures/Quack Cures: Is Epsom Worth Its Salt? |publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' |date=April 9, 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412091100/https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303302504577327722133289222.html |archivedate=12 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrates and anhydrous material, production==
A variety of [[water of crystallization|hydrates]] are known.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Odochian [http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=3q44807116q07153&amp;size=largest "Study of the nature of the crystallization water in some magnesium hydrates by thermal methods,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826021910/http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=3q44807116q07153&amp;size=largest |date=26 August 2011 }} ''Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry'', Volume 45, Number 6, December, 1995. {{doi|10.1007/BF02547437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heptahydrate ([[epsomite]]) readily loses one equivalent of water to form the hexahydrate.  Epsom salt takes its name from a bitter saline spring in [[Epsom]] in [[Surrey]], England, where the salt was produced from the springs that arise where the porous chalk of the [[North Downs]] meets non-porous London clay.

The monohydrate, MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is found as the mineral [[kieserite]]. It can be prepared by heating the hexahydrate to approximately 150&amp;nbsp;°C.  Further heating to approximately 200&amp;nbsp;°C gives anhydrous magnesium sulfate.  Upon further heating, the anhydrous salt decomposes into [[magnesium oxide]] (MgO) and [[sulfur trioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

The heptahydrate can be prepared by neutralizing [[sulfuric acid]] with [[magnesium carbonate]] or [[magnesium oxide|oxide]], but it is usually obtained directly from natural sources.

==Uses==
===Medical===
{{See also|Magnesium sulfate (medical use)}}
It is on the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]], the most important medications needed in a basic [[health system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML2015_8-May-15.pdf|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513043105/http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML2015_8-May-15.pdf|archivedate=13 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnesium sulfate is a common mineral [[Magnesium (pharmaceutical preparation)|pharmaceutical preparation of magnesium]], commonly known as Epsom salt, used both externally and internally. Magnesium sulfate is highly water-soluble and solubility is inhibited with lipids typically used in lotions. Lotions often employ the use of emulsions or suspensions to include both oil and water-soluble ingredients.  Hence, magnesium sulfate in a lotion may not be as freely available to migrate to the skin nor to be absorbed through the skin, hence both studies may properly suggest absorption or lack thereof as a function of the carrier (in a water solution vs. in an oil emulsion/suspension).  Temperature and concentration gradients may also be contributing factors to absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.painscience.com/articles/epsom-salts.php|title=Does Epsom Salt Work?|work=www.PainScience.com|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Externally, magnesium sulfate paste is used to treat skin inflammations such as small boils or localised infections. Known in the [[UK]] as 'drawing paste' it is also used to remove splinters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tipking.co.uk/tip/5929.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The standard [[British Pharmacopoeia]] composition is dried Magnesium Sulfate 47.76 % w/w, Phenol 0.49 % w/w. and glycerol (E422).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/8327]&lt;/ref&gt;

Epsom salt is used as [[bath salts]] and for [[isolation tank]]s. Magnesium sulfate is the main preparation of [[intravenous magnesium]].

Internal uses include:
*Oral magnesium sulfate is commonly used as a [[salinity|saline]] [[laxative]] or osmotic purgative. 
*Replacement therapy for [[hypomagnesemia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rxmed.com/b.main/b2.pharmaceutical/b2.1.monographs/CPS-%20Monographs/CPS-%20(General%20Monographs-%20M)/MAGNESIUM%20SULFATE.html|title=Pharmaceutical Information – Magnesium Sulfate|publisher=RxMed|accessdate=2009-07-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403180025/http://www.rxmed.com/b.main/b2.pharmaceutical/b2.1.monographs/CPS-%20Monographs/CPS-%20(General%20Monographs-%20M)/MAGNESIUM%20SULFATE.html|archivedate=3 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===

In [[agriculture]], magnesium [[sulfate]] is used to increase magnesium or sulfur content in [[soil]]. It is most commonly applied to potted plants, or to magnesium-hungry crops, such as [[potato]]es, [[rose]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[lemon]] trees, carrots, and [[Capsicum|peppers]]. The advantage of magnesium sulfate over other magnesium [[soil amendment]]s (such as [[Dolomite|dolomitic lime]]) is its high [[solubility]], which also allows the option of [[foliar feeding]]. Solutions of magnesium sulfate are also nearly neutral, compared with alkaline salts of magnesium as found in limestone; therefore, the use of magnesium sulfate as a magnesium source for soil does not significantly change the soil pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pubchem: magnesium sulfate|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/magnesium_sulfate#section=Chemical-and-Physical-Properties|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018220642/https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/magnesium_sulfate#section=Chemical-and-Physical-Properties|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food preparation===
Magnesium sulfate is used as a brewing salt in [[beer]].

It may also be used as a coagulant for making [[tofu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |inventor-last= Matsuura |inventor-first= Masaru |inventor2-last= Sasaki |inventor2-first= Masaoki |inventor3-last= Sasakib |inventor3-first= Jun |inventor4-last=Takeuchi |inventor4-first= Tomok |publication-date= 28 Mar 2000 |title= Process for producing packed tofu |country-code= US |description= The present invention relates to a novel process for producing packed tofu, particularly a process for producing long-life packed tofu from sterilized soybean milk. |patent-number= 6042851 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry===
[[Anhydrous]] magnesium sulfate is commonly used as a [[desiccant]] in organic synthesis due to its affinity for [[water]]. During [[work-up (chemistry)|work-up]], an organic phase is treated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The hydrated solid is then removed with filtration or decantation. Other inorganic sulfate salts such as [[sodium sulfate]] and [[calcium sulfate]] may be used in the same way.

===Niche uses===
Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is also used to maintain the magnesium concentration in marine aquaria which contain large amounts of stony corals, as it is slowly depleted in their calcification process. In a magnesium-deficient marine aquarium, calcium and alkalinity concentrations are very difficult to control because not enough magnesium is present to stabilize these ions in the saltwater and prevent their spontaneous precipitation into calcium carbonate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Minerals==
Magnesium sulfates are common minerals in geological environments. Their occurrence is mostly connected with [[supergene (geology)|supergene]] processes. Some of them are also important constituents of evaporitic [[potassium]]-magnesium (K-Mg) salts deposits.

Bright spots observed by the [[Dawn Spacecraft]] in [[Occator Crater]] on the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] are most consistent with reflected light from magnesium sulfate hexahydrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ammoniated phyllosilicates with a likely outer Solar System origin on (1) Ceres |author1=M.

Almost all known mineralogical forms of MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are hydrates. [[Epsomite]] is the natural analogue of "Epsom salt".

Both are, however, not the highest known hydrates of MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, due to the recent terrestrial find of [[meridianiite]], MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·11H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is thought to also occur on Mars. Hexahydrite is the next lower (6) hydrate. Three next lower hydrates—pentahydrite, starkeyite, and especially sanderite are rare. [[Kieserite]] is a monohydrate and is common among evaporitic deposits. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate was reported from some burning coal dumps.

==Double salts==
[[Double salts]] containing magnesium sulfate exist, for example there are several known [[sodium magnesium sulfate]]s and [[Potassium magnesium sulfate (disambiguation)|potassium magnesium sulfate]]s&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;.

==Safety==
An abnormally elevated plasma concentration of magnesium is called [[hypermagnesemia]].

S. |last7=Ghandhari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the ultimate destination of the solar power, though, the central problem addressed by MPPT is that the efficiency of power transfer from the solar cell depends on both the amount of sunlight falling on the solar panels and the electrical characteristics of the load. As the amount of sunlight varies, the load characteristic that gives the highest power transfer efficiency changes, so that the efficiency of the system is optimized when the load characteristic changes to keep the power transfer at highest efficiency. This load characteristic is called the ''maximum power point'' (MPP) and MPPT is the process of finding this point and keeping the load characteristic there. Electrical circuits can be designed to present arbitrary loads to the photovoltaic cells and then convert the voltage, current, or frequency to suit other devices or systems, and MPPT solves the problem of choosing the best load to be presented to the cells in order to get the most usable power out.

[[Solar cell]]s have a complex relationship between temperature and total resistance that produces a non-linear output efficiency which can be analyzed based on the [[Current–voltage characteristic|I-V curve]].&lt;ref name="Seyedmahmoudian 402–414"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = A Comparative Study on Procedure and State of the Art of Conventional Maximum Power Point Tracking Techniques for Photovoltaic System |url=http://www.ijcee.org/index.php?m=content&amp;c=index&amp;a=show&amp;catid=63&amp;id=962 |journal=International Journal of Computer and Electrical Engineering |pages=402–414 |volume=6 |issue=5 |doi=10.17706/ijcee.2014.v6.859 |first=Mohammadmehdi |last=Seyedmahmoudian |first2=Arash |last2=Mohamadi |first3=Swarna |last3=Kumary|year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Analytical Modeling of Partially Shaded Photovoltaic Systems |url=http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/6/1/128 |journal=Energies |date=2013-01-04 |pages=128–144 |volume=6 |issue=1 |doi=10.3390/en6010128 |first=Mohammadmehdi |last=Seyedmahmoudian |first2=Saad |last2=Mekhilef |first3=Rasoul |last3=Rahmani |first4=Rubiyah |last4=Yusof |first5=Ehsan Taslimi |last5=Renani}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the purpose of the MPPT system to sample the output of the PV cells and apply the proper resistance (load) to obtain maximum power for any given environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Surawdhaniwar |first=Sonali |author-first2=Ritesh |author-last2=Diwan |title=Study of Maximum Power Point Tracking Using Perturb and Observe Method |journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Engineering &amp; Technology |date=July 2012 |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=106–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPPT devices are typically integrated into an [[electric power converter]] system that provides voltage or current conversion, filtering, and regulation for driving various loads, including power grids, batteries, or motors.
* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to AC power and may incorporate MPPT: such inverters sample the output power (I-V curve) from the solar modules and apply the proper resistance (load) so as to obtain maximum power.
* The power at the MPP (P&lt;sub&gt;mpp&lt;/sub&gt;) is the product of the MPP voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;mpp&lt;/sub&gt;) and MPP current (I&lt;sub&gt;mpp&lt;/sub&gt;).

== Background ==

[[Image:Solar-Cell-IV-curve-with-MPP.png|thumb|Photovoltaic solar cell I-V curves where a line intersects the knee of the curves where the maximum power transfer point is located.]]

[[Photovoltaic cell]]s have a complex relationship between their operating environment and the maximum [[Electric power|power]] they can produce. The [[Solar cell#Efficiency|fill factor]], abbreviated ''FF'', is a parameter which characterizes the non-linear electrical behavior of the solar cell. Fill factor is defined as the ratio of the maximum power from the solar cell to the product of open circuit voltage V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; and short-circuit current I&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;. In tabulated data it is often used to estimate the maximum power that a cell can provide with an optimal load under given conditions, ''P=FF*V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;*I&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;''. For most purposes, FF, V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;, and I&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt; are enough information to give a useful approximate model of the electrical behavior of a photovoltaic cell under typical conditions.

For any given set of operational conditions, cells have a single operating point where the values of the [[Electric current|current]] (''I'') and [[voltage]] (''V'') of the cell result in a maximum [[Electric power|power]] output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Maximum power point tracking of partial shaded photovoltaic array using an evolutionary algorithm: A particle swarm optimization technique |journal=Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy |date=2014-03-01 |issn=1941-7012 |page=023102 |volume=6 |issue=2 |doi=10.1063/1.4868025 |first=Mohammadmehdi |last=Seyedmahmoudian |first2=Saad |last2=Mekhilef |first3=Rasoul |last3=Rahmani |first4=Rubiyah |last4=Yusof |first5=Ali Asghar |last5=Shojaei}}&lt;/ref&gt; These values correspond to a particular load [[electrical resistance|resistance]], which is equal to ''V'' / I as specified by [[Ohm's Law]]. The power P is given by ''P=V*I''. A photovoltaic cell, for the majority of its useful curve, acts as a [[constant current source]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~moyer/GEOS24705/2011/Notes/SolarPhysics.pdf |title=University of Chicago GEOS24705 Solar Photovoltaics EJM May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at a photovoltaic cell's MPP region, its curve has an approximately inverse exponential relationship between current and voltage. From basic circuit theory, the power delivered from or to a device is optimized where the [[derivative]] (graphically, the slope) ''dI/dV'' of the I-V curve is equal and opposite the ''I/V'' ratio (where d''P/dV''=0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sze |first=Simon M. |author-link=Simon M. Sze |date=1981 |edition=2nd |page=796 |title=Physics of Semiconductor Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the ''maximum power point'' (MPP) and corresponds to the "knee" of the curve.

A load with resistance ''R=V/I'' equal to the reciprocal of this value draws the maximum power from the device. This is sometimes called the 'characteristic resistance' of the cell. This is a dynamic quantity which changes depending on the level of illumination, as well as other factors such as temperature and the age of the cell. If the resistance is lower or higher than this value, the power drawn will be less than the maximum available, and thus the cell will not be used as efficiently as it could be. Maximum power point trackers utilize different types of control circuit or logic to search for this point and thus to allow the converter circuit to extract the [[Impedance matching#Power transfer|maximum power]] available from a cell.

== Implementation ==
When a load is directly connected to the solar panel, the operating point of the panel will rarely be at peak power. The impedance seen by the panel derives the operating point of the solar panel. Thus by varying the impedance seen by the panel, the operating point can be moved towards peak power point. Since panels are DC devices, DC-DC converters must be utilized to transform the impedance of one circuit (source) to the other circuit (load). Changing the duty ratio of the DC-DC converter results in an impedance change as seen by the panel. At a particular impedance (or duty ratio) the operating point will be at the peak power transfer point.  The I-V curve of the panel can vary considerably with variation in atmospheric conditions such as radiance and temperature. Therefore, it is not feasible to fix the duty ratio with such dynamically changing operating conditions.

MPPT implementations utilize algorithms that frequently sample panel voltages and currents, then adjust the duty ratio as needed.  Microcontrollers are employed to implement the algorithms. Modern implementations often utilize larger computers for analytics and load forecasting.

== Classification ==
Controllers can follow several strategies to optimize the power output of an array. Maximum power point trackers may implement different algorithms and switch between them based on the operating conditions of the array.&lt;ref&gt;Rahmani, R.; Seyedmahmoudian, M.;, Mekhilef, S.; Yusof, R.; 2013. Implementation of fuzzy logic maximum power point tracking controller for photovoltaic system. American Journal of Applied Sciences, 10: 209-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perturb and observe===
In this method the controller adjusts the voltage by a small amount from the array and measures power; if the power increases, further adjustments in that direction are tried until power no longer increases. This is called the perturb and observe method and is most common, although this method can result in oscillations of power output.&lt;ref name="zone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sbrn.solarbuildings.ca/c/sbn/file_db/Doc_File_e/Advanced%20algorithm%20for%20MPPT.pdf |title=Advanced Algorithm for MPPT Control of Photovoltaic System |publisher=solarbuildings.ca |access-date=2013-12-19 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219221448/http://sbrn.solarbuildings.ca/c/sbn/file_db/Doc_File_e/Advanced%20algorithm%20for%20MPPT.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is referred to as a ''[[hill climbing]]'' method, because it depends on the rise of the curve of power against voltage below the maximum power point, and the fall above that point.&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pip.459 |title=Comparative Study of Maximum Power Point Tracking Algorithms|journal=Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications|volume=11|pages=47–62|year=2003|last1=Hohm|first1=D.

===Incremental conductance===
In the incremental conductance method, the controller measures incremental changes in PV array current and voltage to predict the effect of a voltage change. This method requires more computation in the controller, but can track changing conditions more rapidly than the perturb and observe method (P&amp;O). Like the P&amp;O algorithm, it can produce oscillations in power output.&lt;ref name="dspace"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itee.uq.edu.au/~aupec/aupec06/htdocs/content/pdf/165.pdf |title=Evaluation of Micro Controller Based Maximum Power Point Tracking Methods Using dSPACE Platform |publisher=itee.uq.edu.au |access-date=2011-06-18 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726191244/http://itee.uq.edu.au/~aupec/aupec06/htdocs/content/pdf/165.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method utilizes the incremental conductance (dI/dV) of the photovoltaic array to compute the sign of the change in power with respect to voltage (dP/dV).&lt;ref name="pe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://powerelectronics.com/power_semiconductors/power_microinverters_computercontrolled_improve_0409/ |title=MPPT algorithms |publisher=powerelectronics.com |access-date=2011-06-10|date=April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incremental conductance method computes the maximum power point by comparison of the incremental conductance (I&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt; / V&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt;) to the array conductance (I / V). When these two are the same (I / V = I&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt; / V&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt;), the output voltage is the MPP voltage. The controller maintains this voltage until the irradiation changes and the process is repeated.&lt;ref name="zone"/&gt;

The incremental conductance method is based on the observation that at the maximum power point
dP/dV = 0, and that P = IV. The current from the array can be expressed as a function of the voltage: P = I(V)V. Therefore, dP/dV = VdI/dV + I(V). Setting this equal to zero yields: dI/dV = -I(V)/V. Therefore, the maximum power point is achieved when the incremental conductance is equal to the negative of the instantaneous conductance.

===Current sweep ===
The current sweep method uses a sweep waveform for the PV array current such that the I-V characteristic of the PV array is obtained and updated at fixed time intervals. The maximum power point voltage can then be computed from the characteristic curve at the same intervals.&lt;ref name="refmb1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Esram |first=Trishan |author-first2=P. L. |author-last2=Chapman |title=Comparison of Photovoltaic Array Maximum Power Point Tracking Techniques |journal=IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion |date=2007 |volume=22 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="refmb2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bodur |first=Mehmet |author-first2=M. |author-last2=Ermis |title=Maximum power point tracking for low power photovoltaic solar panels |journal=Proceedings of the 7th Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference |date=1994 |pages=758–761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constant voltage===
The term "constant voltage" in MPP tracking is used to describe different techniques by different authors, one in which the output voltage is regulated to a constant value under all conditions and one in which the output voltage is regulated based on a constant ratio to the measured open circuit voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;). The latter technique is referred to in contrast as the "open voltage" method by some authors.&lt;ref name="wseas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wseas.us/e-library/transactions/power/2008/27-545.pdf |title=Energy comparison of MPPT techniques for PV Systems |publisher=wseas |access-date=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the output voltage is held constant, there is no attempt to track the maximum power point, so it is not a maximum power point tracking technique in a strict sense, though it does have some advantages in cases when the MPP tracking tends to fail, and thus it is sometimes used to supplement an MPPT method in those cases.

In the "constant voltage" MPPT method (also known as the "open voltage method"), the power delivered to the load is momentarily interrupted and the open-circuit voltage with zero current is measured. The controller then resumes operation with the voltage controlled at a fixed ratio, such as 0.76, of the open-circuit voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"&gt;{{cite book |work=ieee.org|doi=10.1109/ICECE.2012.6471698 |title=2012 7th International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering |pages=908–911|year=2012 |last1=Ferdous |first1=S.M. |last2=Mohammad|first2=Mahir Asif|last3=Nasrullah|first3=Farhan|last4=Saleque|first4=Ahmed Mortuza|last5=Muttalib|first5=A.Z.M.Shahriar|isbn=978-1-4673-1436-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually a value which has been determined to be the maximum power point, either empirically or based on modelling, for expected operating conditions.&lt;ref name="dspace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pe"/&gt; The operating point of the PV array is thus kept near the MPP by regulating the array voltage and matching it to the fixed reference voltage V&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;=kV&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;. The value of V&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; may be also chosen to give optimal performance relative to other factors as well as the MPP, but the central idea in this technique is that V&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is determined as a ratio to V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;.

One of the inherent approximations to the "constant voltage" ratio method is that the ratio of the MPP voltage to V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; is only approximately constant, so it leaves room for further possible optimization.

=== Temperature Method  ===
This method of MPPT estimates the MPP voltage (&lt;math&gt;V_{mpp}&lt;/math&gt;) by measuring the temperature of the solar module and comparing it against a reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5684440|title=A MPPT approach based on temperature measurements applied in PV systems - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since changes on irradiation levels have little effect on the maximum power point voltage, its influences may be neglect and the voltage can be assumed to only vary linearly with the temperature.

This algorithm calculates the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;V_{mpp}(T)=V_{mpp}(T_{ref})+u_{V_{mpp}}(T-T_{ref})&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;V_{mpp}&lt;/math&gt;is the voltage at the maximum power point for a given temperature;

&lt;math&gt;T_{ref}&lt;/math&gt;is a reference temperature;

&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;is the measured temperature;

&lt;math&gt;u_{V_{mpp}}&lt;/math&gt;is the temperature coefficient of &lt;math&gt;V_{mpp}&lt;/math&gt;(available in the [[datasheet]]).

==== Advantages ====

* Simplicity: This algorithm solves one linear equation. Therefore, it does not consume much computational power.
* Can be implemented as analog or digital circuits.
* Since temperature varies slowly with time, there are no steady-state oscillation and instability.
* Low cost: [[List of temperature sensors|temperature sensors]] are usually very cheap.
* Robust against [[Noise (electronics)|noise]].

==== Disadvantages ====

* Estimation error might not be negligible for low irradiation levels (e.g. below 200 W/m²).

===Comparison of methods===
Both perturb and observe, and incremental conductance, are examples of "hill climbing" methods that can find the local maximum of the power curve for the operating condition of the PV array, and so provide a true maximum power point.&lt;ref name="Seyedmahmoudian 402–414"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dspace"/&gt;

The perturb and observe method requires oscillating power output around the maximum power point even under steady state irradiance.

The incremental conductance method has the advantage over the perturb and observe (P&amp;O) method that it can determine the maximum power point without oscillating around this value.&lt;ref name="zone"/&gt; It can perform maximum power point tracking under rapidly varying irradiation conditions with higher accuracy than the perturb and observe method.&lt;ref name="zone"/&gt; However, the incremental conductance method can produce oscillations (unintentionally) and can perform erratically under rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. The sampling frequency is decreased due to the higher complexity of the algorithm compared to the P&amp;O method.&lt;ref name="pe"/&gt;

In the constant voltage ratio (or "open voltage") method, the current from the photovoltaic array must be set to zero momentarily to measure the open circuit voltage and then afterwards set to a predetermined percentage of the measured voltage, usually around 76%.&lt;ref name="pe"/&gt; Energy may be wasted during the time the current is set to zero.&lt;ref name="pe"/&gt; The approximation of 76% as the MPP/V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; ratio is not necessarily accurate.&lt;ref name="pe"/&gt; Although simple and low-cost to implement, the interruptions reduce array efficiency and do not ensure finding the actual maximum power point. However, efficiencies of some systems may reach above 95%.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"/&gt;

== MPPT placement ==
Traditional [[solar inverter]]s perform MPPT for the entire PV array (module association) as a whole. In such systems the same current, dictated by the inverter, flows through all modules in the string (series). Because different modules have different I-V curves and different MPPs (due to manufacturing tolerance, partial shading,&lt;ref&gt;Seyedmahmoudian, M.; Mekhilef, S.; Rahmani, R.; Yusof, R.; Renani, E.T. Analytical Modeling of Partially Shaded Photovoltaic Systems. Energies 2013, 6, 128-144.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.) this architecture means some modules will be performing below their MPP, resulting in lower efficiency.&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/solar-at-home/invert-your-thinking-squeezing-more-power-out-of-your-solar-panels/ |title=Invert your thinking: Squeezing more power out of your solar panels |publisher=blogs.scientificamerican.com |access-date=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies (see [[power optimizer]]) are now placing maximum power point tracker into individual modules, allowing each to operate at peak efficiency despite uneven shading, soiling or electrical mismatch.

Data suggests having one inverter with one MPPT for a project that has east and west-facing modules presents no disadvantages when compared to having two inverters or one inverter with more than one MPPT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpv.net/tech/tech_print.asp?idx=418&amp;part_code=030140054 |title=InterPV.net - Global PhotoVoltaic Business Magazine |work=interpv.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation with batteries ==
At night, an off-[[Electrical grid|grid]] PV system may use batteries to supply loads. Although the fully charged battery pack voltage may be close to the PV panel's maximum power point voltage, this is unlikely to be true at sunrise when the battery has been partially discharged. Charging may begin at a voltage considerably below the PV panel maximum power point voltage, and an MPPT can resolve this mismatch.

When the batteries in an off-grid system are fully charged and PV production exceeds local loads, an MPPT can no longer operate the panel at its maximum power point as the excess power has no load to absorb it. The MPPT must then shift the PV panel operating point away from the peak power point until production exactly matches demand. (An alternative approach commonly used in spacecraft is to divert surplus PV power into a resistive load, allowing the panel to operate continuously at its peak power point.)

In a grid connected [[photovoltaic]] system, all delivered power from solar modules will be sent to the grid. Therefore, the MPPT in a grid connected PV system will always attempt to operate the PV modules at its maximum power point.

'''Mercury''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Hg''' and [[atomic number]] 80. It is commonly known as '''quicksilver''' and was formerly named '''hydrargyrum''' ({{IPAc-en|h|aɪ|ˈ|d|r|ɑr|dʒ|ər|ə|m}} {{respell|hy|DRAR|jər|əm}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hydrargyrum "hydrargyrum"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812203929/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hydrargyrum |date=12 August 2014 }}. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy]], silvery [[d-block]] element, mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]]; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is [[bromine]], though metals such as [[caesium]],&lt;!--Fr is not completely certain--&gt; [[gallium]], and [[rubidium]] melt just above [[room temperature]].

Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as [[cinnabar]] ([[mercuric sulfide]]). The red pigment [[vermilion]] is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercuric sulfide.

Mercury is used in [[thermometer]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[manometer]]s, [[sphygmomanometer]]s, [[float valve]]s, [[mercury switch]]es, [[mercury relay]]s, [[fluorescent lamp]]s and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as [[alcohol]]- or [[galinstan]]-filled glass thermometers and [[thermistor]]- or [[Infrared thermometer|infrared]]-based electronic instruments.  Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers.

Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] for [[dental restoration]] in some locales. It is also used in [[fluorescent lighting]]. Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave [[ultraviolet light]], which then causes the phosphor in the tube to [[fluoresce]], making visible light.

[[Mercury poisoning]] can result from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury (such as [[mercuric chloride]] or [[methylmercury]]), by inhalation of mercury vapor, or by ingesting any form of mercury.

A complete explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves deep into the realm of [[quantum physics]], but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique [[electron configuration]] where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s [[Electron shell#Subshells|subshells]]. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to [[noble gas]]es, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.

The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the [[nuclear charge]] that increases the attractive [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb interaction]] of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see [[lanthanide contraction]]). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of [[cadmium]] and [[zinc]], although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.&lt;!--On the other hand, [[gold]], which is one space to the left of mercury on the periodic table, has atoms with one fewer 6s electron than mercury. Those electrons are more easily removed and are shared between the gold atoms forming relatively strong [[metallic bonds]].--&gt;&lt;ref name=Senese1997/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norrby"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Norrby, L.J.|title=Why is mercury liquid?

===Chemical properties===
Mercury does not react with most acids, such as dilute [[sulfuric acid]], although [[oxidizing acid]]s such as concentrated sulfuric acid and [[nitric acid]] or [[aqua regia]] dissolve it to give [[Mercuric sulfate|sulfate]], [[Mercury(II) nitrate|nitrate]], and [[Mercury(II) chloride|chloride]]. Like silver, mercury reacts with atmospheric [[hydrogen sulfide]]. Mercury reacts with solid sulfur flakes, which are used in mercury spill kits to absorb mercury (spill kits also use [[activated carbon]] and powdered zinc).&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt;

====Amalgams====
[[File:Mercury discharge tube.jpg|thumb|left|Mercury-discharge spectral calibration lamp]]
Mercury dissolves many other metals such as gold and silver to form [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgams]]. Iron is an exception, and iron flasks have traditionally been used to trade mercury. Several other first row transition metals with the exception of [[manganese]], [[copper]] and [[zinc]] are reluctant to form amalgams. Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include [[platinum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gmelin, Leopold|title=Hand book of chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AI5AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=30 December 2012|date=1852|publisher=Cavendish Society|pages=103 (Na), 110 (W), 122 (Zn), 128 (Fe), 247 (Au), 338 (Pt)|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509033751/http://books.google.com/books?id=1AI5AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA128|archivedate=9 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Soratur|title=Essentials of Dental Materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6HbxyaSt78C&amp;pg=PT14|date=2002|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|isbn=978-81-7179-989-3|page=14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603085942/https://books.google.com/books?id=N6HbxyaSt78C&amp;pg=PT14|archivedate=3 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sodium amalgam]] is a common reducing agent in [[organic synthesis]], and is also used in [[high-pressure sodium]] lamps.

Mercury readily combines with [[aluminium]] to form a [[aluminium amalgam|mercury-aluminium amalgam]] when the two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam destroys the [[aluminium oxide]] layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in-depth (as in iron [[rust]]ing), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.&lt;ref name="CorrAl"&gt;{{cite book |author =Vargel, C. |author2 =Jacques, M. |author3 =Schmidt, M.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of mercury}}
There are seven stable [[isotope]]s of mercury with {{chem|202|Hg}} being the most abundant (29.86%). The longest-lived [[radioisotope]]s are {{chem|194|Hg}} with a [[half-life]] of 444 years, and {{chem|203|Hg}} with a half-life of 46.612 days. Most of the remaining radioisotopes have half-lives that are less than a day. {{chem|199|Hg}} and {{chem|201|Hg}} are the most often studied [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]]-active nuclei, having spins of {{frac|2}} and {{frac|3|2}} respectively.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

==Etymology==
Hg is the modern [[chemical symbol]] for mercury. It comes from ''hydrargyrum'', a [[Latin]]ized form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ὑδράργυρος (''hydrargyros''), which is a compound word meaning "water-silver" (from ὑδρ- ''hydr-'', the root of ὕδωρ, "water," and ἄργυρος ''argyros'' "silver") – since it is liquid like water and shiny like silver. The element was named after the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], known for his speed and mobility. It is associated with the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]; the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the [[alchemical symbol]]s for the metal; the Sanskrit word for alchemy is ''[[Rasavātam]]'' which means "the way of mercury".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ykEN2zHvCpQC&amp;pg=PA260|page=260|title=The Pillar of Celestial Fire|author=Cox, R|publisher=1st World Publishing|date= 1997|isbn=978-1-887472-30-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name.&lt;ref name="Stillman"/&gt;

[[Alchemy|Alchemists]] thought of mercury as the [[Prima materia|First Matter]] from which all metals were formed. They believed that different [[metals]] could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of [[sulfur]] contained within the mercury.

The mines in [[Almadén]] (Spain), [[Monte Amiata]] (Italy), and [[Idrija]] (now Slovenia) dominated mercury production from the opening of the mine in Almadén 2500 years ago, until new deposits were found at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="MercHz"&gt;{{cite book|title =Mercury hazards to living organisms|author= Eisler, R.| publisher = CRC Press|date = 2006|isbn = 978-0-8493-9212-2|url = https://books.google.com/?id=gqc8wUvsI8cC&amp;pg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==

Mercury is an extremely rare element in Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], having an average crustal abundance by mass of only 0.08 parts per million (ppm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GerdDmwMTLkC&amp;pg=PA265|page=265|title=Geomicrobiology|author=Ehrlich, H.

The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in [[cinnabar]], metacinnabar, [[corderoite]], [[livingstonite]] and other [[mineral]]s, with cinnabar (HgS) being the most common ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/s00254-002-0629-5|title=Mercury from mineral deposits and potential environmental impact |journal=Environmental Geology|volume=43|issue=3|pages=326–338|author=Rytuba, James J|year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metacinnabar&gt;https://www.mindat.org/min-2670.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury ores {{Citation span|text=usually occur in very young [[Orogeny|orogenic belts]] where rocks of high density are forced to the crust of Earth,|date=March 2017}} often in hot springs or other [[volcano|volcanic]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=7 July 2009|title=Mercury Recycling in the United States in 2000|publisher=USGS|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1196u/Circ_1196_U.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326135650/http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1196u/Circ_1196_U.pdf|archivedate=26 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1558, with the invention of the [[patio process]] to extract silver from ore using mercury, mercury became an essential resource in the economy of Spain and its American colonies. Mercury was used to extract silver from the lucrative mines in [[New Spain]] and [[Peru]]. Initially, the Spanish Crown's mines in Almadén in Southern Spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burkholder, M.|author2=Johnson, L.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Colonial Latin America|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 2008|pages=157–159|isbn=978-0-19-504542-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury deposits were discovered in the New World, and more than 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of [[Huancavelica]], Peru, over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563.

Former mines in Italy, the United States and Mexico, which once produced a large proportion of the world supply, have now been completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia ([[Idrija]]) and Spain ([[Almadén]]), shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury. [[Nevada]]'s [[McDermitt, Nevada-Oregon|McDermitt]] Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992.

Mercury is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor. The equation for this extraction is
:HgS + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Hg + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://act.credoaction.com/campaign/thanks_mercury/?rc=fb_share1 About the Mercury Rule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501171523/http://act.credoaction.com/campaign/thanks_mercury/?rc=fb_share1 |date= 1 May 2012 }}.

Abandoned mercury mine processing sites often contain very hazardous waste piles of roasted cinnabar [[calcine]]s. Water run-off from such sites is a recognized source of ecological damage. Former mercury mines may be suited for constructive re-use.

===Compounds of mercury(I)===
Unlike its lighter neighbors, cadmium and zinc, mercury usually forms simple stable compounds with metal-metal bonds. Most mercury(I) compounds are [[diamagnetic]] and feature the dimeric cation, Hg{{su|b=2|p=2+}}. Stable derivatives include the chloride and nitrate. Treatment of Hg(I) compounds complexation with strong ligands such as sulfide, cyanide, etc. induces disproportionation to {{chem|Hg|2+}} and elemental mercury.&lt;ref name="henderson"&gt;{{cite book| title = Main group chemistry| author = Henderson, W.| location = Great Britain| publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry| date = 2000| isbn = 978-0-85404-617-1| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=twdXz1jfVOsC&amp;pg=PA162| page = 162| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160513101559/https://books.google.com/books?id=twdXz1jfVOsC&amp;pg=PA162| archivedate = 13 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercury(I) chloride]], a colorless solid also known as [[calomel]], is really the compound with the formula Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with the connectivity Cl-Hg-Hg-Cl. It is a standard in electrochemistry. It reacts with chlorine to give mercuric chloride, which resists further oxidation. [[Mercury(I) hydride]], a colorless gas, has the formula HgH, containing no Hg-Hg bond.

Indicative of its tendency to bond to itself, mercury forms [[mercury polycations]], which consist of linear chains of mercury centers, capped with a positive charge. One example is {{chem|Hg|3|2+|(AsF|6|-|)}}{{su|b=2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Brown | first1 = I. D.| last2 = Gillespie | first2 = R. J.| last3 = Morgan | first3 = K.

===Compounds of mercury(II)===
Mercury(II) is the most common oxidation state and is the main one in nature as well. All four mercuric halides are known. They form tetrahedral complexes with other ligands but the halides adopt linear coordination geometry, somewhat like Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; does. Best known is [[mercury(II) chloride]], an easily [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimating]] white solid. HgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forms [[coordination complex]]es that are typically tetrahedral, e.g. {{chem|HgCl|4|2-}}.

[[Mercury(II) oxide]], the main [[oxide]] of mercury, arises when the metal is exposed to air for long periods at elevated temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400&amp;nbsp;°C, as was demonstrated by [[Joseph Priestley]] in an early synthesis of pure [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized, as they are for its neighbors gold and silver.

Being a [[HSAB|soft metal]], mercury forms very stable derivatives with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is [[mercury(II) sulfide]], HgS, which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar and is the brilliant pigment [[vermilion|vermillion]]. Like ZnS, HgS crystallizes in two [[Polymorphism (materials science)|forms]], the reddish cubic form and the black [[zinc blende]] form.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; The latter sometimes occurs naturally as metacinnabar.&lt;ref name=metacinnabar/&gt; [[Mercury(II) selenide]] (HgSe) and [[mercury(II) telluride]] (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. [[mercury cadmium telluride]] and [[mercury zinc telluride]] being [[semiconductors]] useful as [[infrared detector]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4b3WLgomvd0C&amp;pg=PA507|page=507|title=Infrared detectors|author=Rogalski, A|publisher=CRC Press|date=2000|isbn=978-90-5699-203-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercury(II) salts form a variety of complex derivatives with [[ammonia]]. These include Millon's base (Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the one-dimensional polymer (salts of {{chem|HgNH|2|+}}){{su|b=n}}), and "fusible white precipitate" or [Hg(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Known as [[Nessler's reagent]], [[potassium tetraiodomercurate(II)]] ({{chem|HgI|4|2-}}) is still occasionally used to test for ammonia owing to its tendency to form the deeply colored iodide salt of Millon's base.

[[Mercury(II) fulminate|Mercury fulminate]] is a [[detonator]] widely used in [[explosive]]s.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

===Organomercury compounds===
{{Main|Organomercury compound}}
Organic mercury [[chemical compound|compounds]] are historically important but are of little industrial value in the western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organomercury compounds are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike [[organocadmium]] and [[organozinc]] compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is [[aryl]] or [[alkyl]] and X is usually halide or acetate. [[Methylmercury]], a generic term for compounds with the formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in [[pollution|polluted]] water.&lt;ref name="methylHg"&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=BPvWJbBMd7wC|title = Toxicological effects of methylmercury|author = National Research Council (U.S.) – Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology| publisher = National Academies Press|date = 2000|isbn = 978-0-309-07140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They arise by a process known as [[biomethylation]].

==Applications==
[[File:Maximum thermometer close up 2.JPG|thumb|right|The bulb of a [[mercury-in-glass thermometer]]]]
Mercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures. A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in [[fluorescent lamps]], while most of the other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive [[Galinstan]] [[alloy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00216-005-0069-7|date=November 2005|author=Surmann, P|author2=Zeyat, H|title=Voltammetric analysis using a self-renewable non-mercury electrode|volume=383|issue=6|pages=1009–13|pmid=16228199|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
{{see also|Amalgam (dentistry)}}[[File:Amalgam.jpg|thumb|right|Amalgam filling]]
Mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine, although they are much less common today than they once were, now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely understood. The first edition of the Merck's Manual featured many mercuric compounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merck's Manual 1899|edition=First|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41697|accessdate=16 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824150245/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41697|archivedate=24 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as:

Mercury is an ingredient in [[amalgam (dentistry)|dental amalgams]]. [[Thiomersal]] (called ''Thimerosal'' in the United States) is an [[organic compound]] used as a [[preservative]] in [[vaccine]]s, though this use is in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = FDA|url = http://www.fda.gov/Cber/vaccine/thimerosal.htm|title = Thimerosal in Vaccines|accessdate = 25 October 2006|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061026030022/http://www.fda.gov/CBER/vaccine/thimerosal.htm|archivedate = 26 October 2006|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiomersal is metabolized to [[ethyl mercury]]. Although it was [[Thiomersal controversy|widely speculated]] that this mercury-based preservative could cause or trigger [[autism]] in children, scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=2004 |volume=114 |title= Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autistic spectrum disorder: a critical review of published original data |author= Parker SK |author2= Schwartz B |author3= Todd J |author4= Pickering LK |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-0434 |pmid=15342856|issue=3 |pages=793–804|citeseerx=10.1.1.327.363 }} [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/115/1/200 Erratum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813093824/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/115/1/200 |date=13 August 2007 }} (2005).

Another mercury compound, [[merbromin]] (Mercurochrome), is a topical antiseptic used for minor cuts and scrapes that is still in use in some countries.

Mercury in the form of one of its common ores, cinnabar, is used in various traditional medicines, especially in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. Review of its safety has found that cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated, consumed in [[overdose]], or taken long term, and can have adverse effects at therapeutic doses, though effects from therapeutic doses are typically reversible. Although this form of mercury appears to be less toxic than other forms, its use in traditional Chinese medicine has not yet been justified, as the therapeutic basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liu J |author2= Shi JZ |author3=Yu LM |author4=Goyer RA |author5=Waalkes MP |title=Mercury in traditional medicines: is cinnabar toxicologically similar to common mercurials? |journal=Exp.

Today, the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects, especially in developed countries. [[Mercury-in-glass thermometer|Thermometers]] and [[sphygmomanometer]]s containing mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries, respectively. In the early 21st century, their use is declining and has been banned in some countries, states and medical institutions. In 2002, the [[U.S. Senate]] passed legislation to phase out the sale of [[Medical prescription|non-prescription]] mercury thermometers. In 2003, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Maine]] became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahanews.com/ahanews_app/jsp/display.jsp?dcrpath=AHA/NewsStory_Article/data/ann_030602_mercuryban&amp;domain=AHANEWS|title=Two States Pass First-time Bans on Mercury Blood Pressure Devices|date=2 June 2003|publisher=Health Care Without Harm|accessdate=1 May 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004113348/http://www.ahanews.com/ahanews_app/jsp/display.jsp?dcrpath=AHA%2FNewsStory_Article%2Fdata%2Fann_030602_mercuryban&amp;domain=AHANEWS|archivedate=4 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury compounds are found in some [[over-the-counter drug]]s, including topical [[antiseptics]], stimulant laxatives, [[diaper rash|diaper-rash]] [[ointment]], [[eye drops]], and [[nasal spray]]s.

===Production of chlorine and caustic soda===
[[Chlorine]] is produced from [[sodium chloride]] (common salt, NaCl) using [[electrolysis]] to separate the metallic [[sodium]] from the chlorine gas. Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine. By-products of any such [[chloralkali process]] are hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH), which is commonly called caustic soda or [[lye]]. By far the largest use of mercury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The CRB Commodity Yearbook (annual)|date= 2000|page=173|issn=1076-2906}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USEPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/pubs/600r02104/600r02104chap3.pdf|format=PDF|author=Leopold, B.

===Laboratory uses===
Some [[Mercury-in-glass thermometer|medical thermometers]], especially those for high temperatures, are filled with mercury; they are gradually disappearing. In the United States, non-prescription sale of mercury fever thermometers has been banned since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Mercury Reduction Act of 2003|url = http://openlibrary.org/b/OL17617678M|accessdate = 6 June 2009|publisher = United States.

Mercury is also found in [[liquid mirror telescopes]].

Some [[Meridian circle#Structure|transit telescopes]] use a basin of mercury to form a flat and absolutely horizontal mirror, useful in determining an absolute vertical or perpendicular reference.  Concave horizontal parabolic mirrors may be formed by rotating liquid mercury on a disk, the parabolic form of the liquid thus formed reflecting and focusing incident light. Such telescopes are cheaper than conventional large mirror telescopes by up to a factor of 100, but the mirror cannot be tilted and always points straight up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030818233315/http://www.govertschilling.nl/artikelen/science/030314_sc.htm|url=http://www.govertschilling.nl/artikelen/science/030314_sc.htm|title=Liquid-mirror telescope set to give stargazing a new spin|date=14 March 2003|archivedate=18 August 2003|publisher=Govert Schilling|accessdate=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Gibson, B.

===Niche uses===
Gaseous mercury is used in [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s and some "[[neon sign]]" type advertising signs and [[fluorescent lamp]]s. Those low-pressure lamps emit very spectrally narrow lines, which are traditionally used in [[optical spectroscopy]] for calibration of spectral position. Commercial calibration lamps are sold for this purpose; reflecting a fluorescent ceiling light into a spectrometer is a common calibration practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = A guide to the use and calibration of detector array equipment| author = Hopkinson, G.

Many historic applications made use of the peculiar physical properties of mercury, especially as a dense liquid and a liquid metal:
* Quantities of liquid mercury ranging from {{convert|90|to|600|g|oz}} have been recovered from elite [[Maya civilization|Maya]] tombs (100-700AD)&lt;ref name="Yuhas"/&gt; or ritual caches at six sites. This mercury may have been used in bowls as [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirrors]] for [[Divination|divinatory]] purposes. Five of these date to the Classic Period of Maya civilization (c. 250–900) but one example predated this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Healy | first1 = Paul F. |first2 = Marc G. | last2 = Blainey |date=2011 |title=Ancient Maya Mosaic Mirrors: Function, Symbolism, And Meaning |journal=Ancient Mesoamerica |issue=2 |pages=229–244 (241) |doi=10.1017/S0956536111000241 |volume=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Islamic Spain]], it was used for filling decorative pools. Later, the American artist [[Alexander Calder]] built a [[mercury fountain]] for the Spanish Pavilion at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 World Exhibition in Paris]]. The fountain is now on display at the [[Fundació Joan Miró]] in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pgUfSrD4gzQC&amp;pg=PA10|page=10|title=Mercury|author=Lew K|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|date= 2008|isbn=978-1-4042-1780-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mercury was used inside [[wobbler (fishing)|wobbler]] lures. Its heavy, liquid form made it useful since the lures made an attractive irregular movement when the mercury moved inside the plug. Such use was stopped due to environmental concerns, but illegal preparation of modern fishing plugs has occurred.

Several other plants were built, including the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, NH, which went online in 1950. The idea did not catch on industry-wide due to the weight and toxicity of mercury, as well as the advent of [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] steam plants in later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FigDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|title=Cheaper Power from Quicksilver|author=Mueller, Grover C. |date=September 1929|publisher=Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/POWER/mercury/mercury.htm|date=13 November 2008|work=Museum of Retro Technology|title=Mercury as a Working Fluid|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221034317/http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/POWER/mercury/mercury.htm|archivedate=21 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similarly, liquid mercury was used as a [[coolant]] for some [[nuclear reactor]]s; however, [[sodium]] is proposed for reactors cooled with liquid metal, because the high density of mercury requires much more energy to circulate as coolant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2KYVftKE9NUC&amp;pg=PA64|page=64|title=Introduction to Nuclear Power|author=Collier|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date=1987|isbn=978-1-56032-682-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mercury was a propellant for early [[ion engines]] in [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric space propulsion]] systems. Advantages were mercury's high molecular weight, low ionization energy, low dual-ionization energy, high liquid density and liquid storability at [[room temperature]]. Disadvantages were concerns regarding environmental impact associated with ground testing and concerns about eventual cooling and condensation of some of the propellant on the spacecraft in long-duration operations. The first spaceflight to use electric propulsion was a mercury-fueled ion thruster developed by [[NASA Glenn Research Center|NASA Lewis]] and flown on the Space Electric Rocket Test "[[SERT-1]]" spacecraft launched by [[NASA]] at its [[Wallops Flight Facility]] in 1964. The SERT-1 flight was followed up by the SERT-2 flight in 1970. Mercury and [[caesium]] were preferred propellants for ion engines until [[Hughes Research Laboratory]] performed studies finding [[xenon]] gas to be a suitable replacement. Xenon is now the preferred propellant for ion engines as it has a high molecular weight, little or no reactivity due to its [[noble gas]] nature, and has a high liquid density under mild cryogenic storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA|accessdate=7 July 2009|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/ds1.html|title=Glenn Contributions to Deep Space 1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001110901/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/ds1.html|archivedate=1 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=7 July 2009|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/electricprop.html|title=Electric space propulsion|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530080218/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/electricprop.html|archivedate=30 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others applications made use of the chemical properties of mercury:
* The [[mercury battery]] is a non-rechargeable [[electrochemical battery]], a [[primary cell]], that was common in the middle of the 20th century. It was used in a wide variety of applications and was available in various sizes, particularly button sizes. Its constant voltage output and long shelf life gave it a niche use for camera light meters and hearing aids. The mercury cell was effectively banned in most countries in the 1990s due to concerns about the mercury contaminating landfills.&lt;ref name="IMERC Mercury Use in Batteries"&gt;{{cite web| title=IMERC Fact Sheet: Mercury Use in Batteries| url=http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/mercury/imerc/factsheets/batteries.cfm| publisher=Northeast Waste Management Officials' Association| accessdate=20 June 2013| date=January 2010| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129031541/http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/mercury/imerc/factsheets/batteries.cfm| archivedate=29 November 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Chloralkali process]]: The largest industrial use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the [[anode]] of the [[Castner-Kellner process]]. The chlorine was used for bleaching paper (hence the location of many of these plants near paper mills) while the sodium was used to make sodium hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products. This usage has largely been discontinued, replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19171026|title=Mercury from Chlor-alkali plants|journal=Environmental Health|date=2009|volume=8|url=http://tankdc.com/getdoc/c21877bc-357a-4f46-980f-988e85d00a54/Article_51-10_Autism,_Mercury_and_High_Fructose_Co.aspx|doi=10.1186/1476-069X-8-2|last1=Dufault|first1=Renee|last2=Leblanc|first2=Blaise|last3=Schnoll|first3=Roseanne|last4=Cornett|first4=Charles|last5=Schweitzer|first5=Laura|last6=Wallinga|first6=David|last7=Hightower|first7=Jane|last8=Patrick|first8=Lyn|last9=Lukiw|first9=Walter J.|page=2|pmc=2637263|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729135522/http://tankdc.com/getdoc/c21877bc-357a-4f46-980f-988e85d00a54/Article_51-10_Autism,_Mercury_and_High_Fructose_Co.aspx|archivedate=29 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* From the mid-18th to the mid-19th centuries, a process called "[[carroting]]" was used in the making of [[felt]] hats. Animal skins were rinsed in an orange solution (the term "carroting" arose from this color) of the mercury compound [[mercuric nitrate]], Hg(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Inorganic Chemistry|author=Lee, J.D.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|date=1999|isbn=978-0-632-05293-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process separated the fur from the pelt and matted it together. This solution and the vapors it produced were highly toxic. The [[United States Public Health Service]] banned the use of mercury in the felt industry in December 1941. The psychological symptoms associated with mercury poisoning inspired the phrase "[[mad as a hatter]]". [[Lewis Carroll]]'s "[[Mad Hatter]]" in his book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' was a play on words based on the older phrase, but the character himself does not exhibit symptoms of mercury poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |date=1983 |volume=287 |page=1961 |title= Did the Mad Hatter have mercury poisoning? |author= Waldron, HA |pmid=6418283 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.287.6409.1961 |issue= 6409 |pmc= 1550196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--https://www.jstor.org/pss/139669--&gt;

Mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain [[mercury-in-glass thermometer|thermometers]] or [[fluorescent light bulb]]s), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mercury/spills/index.htm|title=Mercury: Spills, Disposal and Site Cleanup|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=11 August 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513130136/http://epa.gov/mercury/spills/index.htm|archivedate=13 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an [[eyedropper]], or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine [[sulfur]], [[zinc]], or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.

Mercury can be absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes and mercury vapors can be inhaled, so containers of mercury are securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation. Heating of mercury, or of compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated, should be carried out with adequate ventilation in order to minimize exposure to mercury vapor. The most toxic forms of mercury are its [[organic compounds]], such as [[dimethylmercury]] and [[methylmercury]].  Mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning.

===Releases in the environment===
[[File:Mercury in Ice Core Upper Fremont Glacier.svg|thumb|right|Amount of atmospheric mercury deposited at Wyoming's Upper Fremont Glacier over the last 270 years]]

Preindustrial deposition rates of mercury from the atmosphere may be about 4&amp;nbsp;ng /(1 L of ice deposit). Although that can be considered a natural level of exposure, regional or global sources have significant effects. Volcanic eruptions can increase the atmospheric source by 4–6 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxics.usgs.gov/pubs/FS-051-02/|title=Glacial Ice Cores Reveal A Record of Natural and Anthropogenic Atmospheric Mercury Deposition for the Last 270 Years|publisher=United States Geological Survey (USGS)|accessdate=1 May 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704010753/http://toxics.usgs.gov/pubs/FS-051-02/|archivedate=4 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural sources, such as [[volcano]]es, are responsible for approximately half of atmospheric mercury emissions.

* 65% from stationary combustion, of which [[coal-fired power plant]]s are the largest aggregate source (40% of U.S. mercury emissions in 1999). This includes power plants fueled with gas where the mercury has not been removed. Emissions from coal combustion are between one and two orders of magnitude higher than emissions from oil combustion, depending on the country.&lt;ref name=Pacyna/&gt;

Mercury also enters into the environment through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/reduce/epr/products/mercury.htm|title=Mercury-containing Products|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|accessdate=1 May 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212061414/http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/reduce/epr/products/mercury.htm|archivedate=12 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to health concerns (see below), [[waste management|toxics use reduction]] efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products.

Most thermometers now use pigmented [[alcohol]] instead of mercury, and [[galinstan]] alloy thermometers are also an option. Mercury thermometers are still occasionally used in the medical field because they are more accurate than alcohol thermometers, though both are commonly being replaced by electronic thermometers and less commonly by galinstan thermometers. Mercury thermometers are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range.

Historically, one of the largest releases was from the Colex plant, a lithium-isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The plant operated in the 1950s and 1960s.

===Occupational exposure===
[[File:EPA workers clean up residential mercury spill (3986684199).jpg|thumb|EPA workers clean up residential mercury spill in 2004]]
Due to the health effects of mercury exposure, industrial and commercial uses are regulated in many countries. The [[World Health Organization]], [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], and [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] all treat mercury as an occupational hazard, and have established specific occupational exposure limits. Environmental releases and disposal of mercury are regulated in the U.S. primarily by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].

====Effects and symptoms of mercury poisoning====
{{Main|Mercury poisoning}}
Toxic effects include damage to the brain, kidneys and lungs. Mercury poisoning can result in several diseases, including [[acrodynia]] (pink disease), Hunter-Russell syndrome, and [[Minamata disease]].

Symptoms typically include sensory impairment (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation and a lack of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. [[Case–control studies]] have shown effects such as tremors, impaired [[cognitive]] skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42&amp;nbsp;μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="ngim"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chronic neurobehavioral effects of elemental mercury in dentists|pmid=1463679|journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=49|issue=11| date=1992|author1=Ngim, CH|author2=Foo, SC|author3=Boey, K.W.|author4=Keyaratnam, J|pmc=1039326|pages=782–90|doi=10.1136/oem.49.11.782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liang"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Psychological effects of low exposure to mercury vapor: Application of computer-administered neurobehavioral evaluation system|journal=Environmental Research|volume=60| doi=10.1006/enrs.1993.1040|date=1993|pmid=8472661|last1=Liang|first1=Y.

Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including [[erethism]], irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{EHC-ref | id = 001 | name = Mercury | date = 1976 | isbn = 92-4-154061-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EHC-ref | id = 118 | name = Inorganic mercury | date = 1991 | isbn = 92-4-157118-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
Research on the treatment of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-[[penicillamine]] (NAP), [[British Anti-Lewisite]] (BAL), [[2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid]] (DMPS), and [[dimercaptosuccinic acid]] (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bluhm, RE |journal=Hum Exp Toxicol |date=1992 |volume=11|issue=3|title=Elemental Mercury Vapour Toxicity, Treatment, and Prognosis After Acute, Intensive Exposure in Chloralkali Plant Workers.

===Fish===
{{Main|Mercury in fish}}
[[Fish]] and [[shellfish]] have a natural tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often in the form of [[methylmercury]], a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the [[food chain]], such as [[shark]], [[swordfish]], [[king mackerel]], [[bluefin tuna]], [[albacore tuna]], and [[tilefish]] contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the [[viscera]], although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cocoros | first1 = G. | last2 = Cahn | first2 = P. H. | last3 = Siler | first3 = W. | title = Mercury concentrations in fish, plankton and water from three Western Atlantic estuaries | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8649.1973.tb04500.x | url = http://www.feedmethefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cocoros_and_cahn_19731.pdf | journal = Journal of Fish Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 641–647 | year = 1973 | pmid =  | pmc =  | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140211065046/http://feedmethefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cocoros_and_cahn_19731.pdf | archivedate = 11 February 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the [[food chain]] amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called [[biomagnification]]. [[Mercury poisoning]] happened this way in [[Minamata, Kumamoto|Minamata]], [[Japan]], now called [[Minamata disease]].

==Regulations==

===International===
140 countries agreed in the [[Minamata Convention on Mercury]] by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) to prevent emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/newscentre/Default.aspx?DocumentID=2702&amp;ArticleID=9373&amp;l=en |title=Minamata Convention Agreed by Nations |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Program]] |accessdate=19 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130192928/http://www.unep.org/NewsCentre/default.aspx?DocumentID=2702&amp;ArticleID=9373&amp;l=en |archivedate=30 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention was signed on 10 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43963&amp;Cr=mercury&amp;Cr1=#.UPt4ikfdP5M|title=UN News&amp;nbsp;— Governments at UN forum agree on legally-binding treaty to curb mercury pollution|last=Section|first=United Nations News Service|date=19 January 2013|website=UN News Service Section|access-date=22 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016131029/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43963&amp;Cr=mercury&amp;Cr1=#.UPt4ikfdP5M|archivedate=16 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] is charged with regulating and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Clean Water Act]], the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]], and the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]]. Additionally, the [[Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act]], passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries.&lt;ref name="epa regs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mercury/regs.htm|title=Mercury: Laws and regulations|date=16 April 2008|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=30 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513123415/http://epa.gov/mercury/regs.htm|archivedate=13 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijc.org/php/publications/html/12br/english/report/chemical/rme.html|title=Reductions in Mercury Emissions|publisher=[[International Joint Commission]] on the [[Great Lakes]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828060223/http://www.ijc.org/php/publications/html/12br/english/report/chemical/rme.html|archivedate=28 August 2008|df=dmy-all|access-date=21 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Clean Air Act (1990)|Clean Air Act]], passed in 1990, put mercury on a list of toxic pollutants that need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent. Thus, industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). In March 2005, the EPA promulgated a regulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/air/mercuryrule/|title=Clean Air Mercury Rule|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|accessdate=1 May 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630045554/http://www.epa.gov/air/mercuryrule/|archivedate=30 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national [[emissions trading|cap and trade]] system. States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on 8 February 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998.&lt;ref name="nj vs epa"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200802/05-1097a.pdf|title=State of New Jersey et al., Petitioners vs. Environmental Protection Agency (Case No. 05-1097)|publisher=United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

===European Union===
In the [[European Union]], the directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (see [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS]]) bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products, and limits the amount of mercury in other products to less than 1000 [[Parts per million|ppm]].&lt;ref name="eu regs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:037:0019:0023:EN:PDF |title=Directive 2002/95/EC on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment|date=27 January 2003 }} Article 4 Paragraph 1. e.g. "Member States shall ensure that, from July 1, 2006, new electrical and electronic equipment put on the market does not contain lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) or polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE)."&lt;/ref&gt; There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, [[lead]], [[hexavalent chromium]] and [[cadmium]]) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eiatrack.org/s/1785|title=Mercury compounds in European Union:|date=2007|publisher=EIA Track|accessdate=30 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428065154/http://www.eiatrack.org/s/1785|archivedate=28 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, the European Union also banned mercury in non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers.

In algebraic geometry, the '''moduli stack of formal group laws''' is a [[stack (mathematics)|stack]] classifying [[formal group]] laws and isomorphisms between them. It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt;. It is a "geometric “object" that underlies the [[chromatic homotopy theory|chromatic]] approach to the [[stable homotopy theory]], a branch of algebraic topology.

Currently, it is not known whether &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[derived stack]] or not. Hence, it is typical to work with stratifications. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; be given so that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}(R)&lt;/math&gt; consists of formal group laws over ''R'' of height exactly ''n''. They form a stratification of the moduli stack  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} \overline{\mathbb{F}_p} \to \mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; is [[faithfully flat morphism|faithfully flat]]. In fact, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} \overline{\mathbb{F}_p} / \operatorname{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}, f)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}, f)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[profinite group]] called the '''Morava stabilizer group'''. The [[Lubin–Tate theory]] describes how the strata &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; fit together.
&lt;!--This moduli stack is closely related to the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]].{{vague}}

In characteristic zero, this moduli stack is very easy to understand: the quotient stack &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}} \times_{\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}} \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;B \mathbb{G}_m&lt;/math&gt;, the [[classifying stack]] of line bundles. This can be thought of as a manifestation of the "thesis" of [[differential graded Lie algebra]]s.

'''Oymyakon''' ({{lang-ru|Оймяко́н}}, {{IPA-ru|ɐjmʲɪˈkon|pron}}; {{lang-sah|Өймөкөөн}}, ''Öymököön'', {{IPA-all|øjmøˈkøːn}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural locality]] (a ''[[village#Russia|selo]]'') in [[Oymyakonsky District]] of the [[Sakha Republic]], [[Russia]], located along the [[Indigirka River]], {{convert|30|km|sp=us}} northwest of [[Tomtor, Oymyakonsky District, Sakha Republic|Tomtor]] on the [[M56 Kolyma Highway|Kolyma Highway]]. It is one of the coldest permanently inhabited locales on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inspiremore.com/worlds-coldest-village/|title=World's Coldest Village Drops To -80° &amp; The Photos Are Spectacular.|date=January 16, 2018|website=InspireMore.com|access-date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
It is named after the Oymyakon River, whose name reportedly comes from the [[Even language|Even]] word ''kheium'', meaning "unfrozen patch of water; place where fish spend the winter."&lt;ref&gt;Е. М. Поспелов. "Географические названия мира". Москва, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;307.&lt;/ref&gt; However, another source states that the Even word ''heyum'' (hэjум) (''kheium'' may be a misspelling) means "frozen lake".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Tsintsius|first=V. I.|publisher=Nauka|year=1977|volume=2|page=361|publication-place=Leningrad|title=Сравнительный словарь тунгусо-маньчжурских языков : материалы к этимологическому словарю}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Oymyakon has two main valleys beside it. These valleys trap wind inside the town and create the colder climate. However, children are still allowed to go to school if it is warmer than {{convert|−55.0|C|1}}.

==History==
During [[World War II]], an airfield was built there for the Alaska-Siberian ([[ALSIB]]) air route used to ferry American [[Lend-Lease]] aircraft to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref&gt;Lebedev, Igor ''Aviation Lend-Lease to Russia'' Nova Publishers (1997) pp. 44-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last few decades, the population of Oymyakon has shrunk considerably. The village had a peak population of around 2,500 inhabitants when it was a central town of the region,{{when|date=October 2018}} but that number has dwindled to less than 900 in 2018.&lt;ref name="Konbini" group=Videos /&gt;

==Climate==
With an extreme [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfd/Dwd''), Oymyakon is known as one of the places considered the Northern [[Pole of Cold]], the others being the rural locality of [[Delyankir]], also located in the Oymyakonsky district of the Sakha Republic, and the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|town]] of [[Verkhoyansk]], located 629 km (391 miles) away by air. The ground is permanently frozen (continuous [[permafrost]]).

There is a monument built around the town square commemorating a reading in the 1920s of −71.2. This was shown on the Australian programme ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' in a 2012 documentary.&lt;ref name="60 Min Australia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chilling Out – Visiting the Coldest Town in the World |work=[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]] |date=June 20, 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1noUh2NrLI |via=[[YouTube]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 6, 1933, a temperature of {{convert|−67.7|C|1}} was recorded at Oymyakon's weather station.&lt;ref name="Stepanova"&gt;{{cite web|author=N.A. Stepanova |title=On the Lowest Temperatures on Earth|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/086/mwr-086-01-0006.pdf |publisher=Docs.lib.noaa.gov
|accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weather Underground - Christopher C. Burt - The Coldest Places on Earth https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/the-coldest-places-on-earth&lt;/ref&gt; This was the coldest officially recorded temperature in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Only [[Antarctica]] has recorded lower official temperatures (the lowest being {{convert|-89.2|C|F}}, recorded at [[Vostok Station]] on 21 July 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World:Lowest Temperature |url=http://wmo.asu.edu/world-lowest-temperature |publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]] |accessdate=4 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616025722/http://wmo.asu.edu/world-lowest-temperature |archivedate=June 16, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Weather &amp; Climate Extremes|url=http://wmo.asu.edu/#global|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weather station is in a valley between Oymyakon and [[Tomtor, Oymyakonsky District, Sakha Republic|Tomtor]]. The station is at {{convert|750|m|sp=us}} and the surrounding mountains at {{convert|1100|m|sp=us}}, causing cold air to pool in the valley: in fact, recent studies show that winter temperatures in the area ''increase'' with altitude by as much as 10&amp;nbsp;°C (18&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igsoc.org/annals/v52/58/a58A068.pdf |title=International Glaciological Society (IGS) |publisher=Igsoc.org |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years the temperature drops below {{convert|0|C|0}} in late September and may remain below freezing until mid-May. In Oymyakon sometimes the average minimum temperature for January, February and December remains below {{convert|-50|C|0}}. Sometimes summer months can also be quite cold, but June and July are the only months where the temperature has never dropped below {{convert|-10|C|0}}. Oymyakon and Verkhoyansk are the only two permanently inhabited places in the world that have recorded temperatures below {{convert|-60.0|C|0}} for every day in January.&lt;ref name="climate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/monitor.php?id=24688&amp;month=1&amp;year=2013 |title=Погода и Климат - Климатический монитор: погода в Оймяконе |publisher=Pogodaiklimat.ru |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="climate-verkhoyansk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/monitor.php?id=24266&amp;month=1&amp;year=2013 |title=Погода и Климат - Климатический монитор: погода в Верхоянске |publisher=Pogodaiklimat.ru |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oymyakon has never recorded an above-freezing temperature between October 25 and March 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/monitor.php?id=24688&amp;month=10&amp;year=2013 |title=Погода и Климат - Климатический монитор: погода в Оймяконе |publisher=Pogodaiklimat.ru |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although winters in Oymyakon are long and excessively cold, summers are mild to warm, sometimes hot.
The warmest month on record is July 2010 with an average temperature of {{convert|+14.7|°C|°F}}.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In June, July and August temperatures over {{convert|30|C|0}} are not rare during the day. On July 28,&amp;nbsp;2010, Oymyakon recorded a record high temperature of {{convert|34.6|C|0}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pogoda.ru.net/monitor.php?id=24688&amp;month=7&amp;year=2010 |title=Погода и Климат - Климатический монитор: погода в Оймяконе |publisher=Pogoda.ru.net |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; yielding a temperature range of 102.3&amp;nbsp;°C (184.1&amp;nbsp;°F). Verkhoyansk,[[Yakutsk]], and [[Delyankir]] are the only other places in the world with a temperature amplitude higher than 100&amp;nbsp;°C (180&amp;nbsp;°F).{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The climate is quite dry, but as average monthly temperatures are below freezing for seven months of the year, substantial evaporation occurs only in summer months. Summers are much wetter than winters.

==In the media==
Oymyakon has been featured in a number of television series:
*The episode "The Winter's Tale" of the 1996 [[PBS]] weather documentary series ''Savage Skies''.
*The season two episode "Siberia" of the documentary series ''[[World's Most Dangerous Roads]]''.
*[[Oxford]] geographer [[Nick Middleton]]'s television series and accompanying book ''Going to Extremes'', in which he discusses his visit to this village and describes ways in which inhabitants cope with the extreme cold.  Middleton describes how Oymyakon lies between two mountain ranges, trapping cold air between throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;Bijal P. Trivedi, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/05/0512_040512_tvoymyakon.html Life Is a Chilling Challenge in Subzero Siberia], National Geographic Channel, May 12, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter, once every two days, the village's cattle's [[herd bull]] was harnessed between the shafts of a sledge with a big water tank on it and led to the spring. The men broke the ice on the spring, let the bull drink its fill, filled the water tank from the spring, and let the bull pull the tanker sledge back into the warm. The water spring was naturally warm and so stayed liquid below the surface ice.
*Cameraman Geoff Mackley along with Rachael Wilson and Mark Whetu from New Zealand, made an episode for [[Discovery Channel]] series Dangerman. They were accompanied by translator Rob Walker (USA) and Vyacheslav Ipatiev (TourServiceCenter). Geoff rode the bull which pulled the water tank sledge to the spring, and spent a night outside in a tent.&lt;ref name="RamboCam"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rambocam.com/archive/siberia.html |title=Geoff Mackley - Siberia -Oymyakon expedition Jan 2004 |publisher=Rambocam.com |date=2004-01-29 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yakutia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yakutiatravel.com/eng/whatson1.htm |title=Events 2005-2010 &amp;#124; Sakha Yakutia – Heart of Siberia |publisher=Yakutiatravel.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24731">'''Property Assessed Clean Energy''' ('''PACE''') is a means of financing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] upgrades or renewable energy installations for residential, commercial and industrial property owners. Depending on state legislation, PACE can be used to finance building envelope energy efficiency improvements like insulation and air sealing, cool roofs, [[water efficiency]] products, seismic retrofits, and hurricane preparedness measures. In some states, commercial PACE can also fund a portion of new construction projects, as long as the building owner agrees to build the new structure to exceed the local energy code. 

Examples of energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades range from adding more attic insulation to installing rooftop solar panels for residential projects and chillers, boilers, LED lighting and roofing for commercial projects. In areas with PACE legislation in place, governments offer a specific [[Government bond|bond]] to [[investors]] or in the case of the open-market model, private lenders provide financing to the building owners to put towards an [[energy retrofit]]. The loans are repaid over the selected term (over the course of somewhere between 5 and 25 years) via an annual assessment on their [[property tax]] bill. PACE bonds can be issued by municipal financing districts, state agencies or finance companies and the proceeds can be used to [[retrofit]] both commercial and residential properties. One of the most notable characteristics of PACE programs is that the loan is attached to the property rather than an individual.&lt;ref name=pn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacenation.us/|title=PACENation: Property Assessed Clean Energy|work=PACENation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faq&gt;[http://votesolar.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/PACE_FAQGeneral1.pdf PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) Financing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rf&gt;{{cite web|url=https://renewfund.com/finance_overview|title=Our Financing Solutions - Renew Financial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarfinancing.1bog.org/pace-program-solar-financing/|title=Solar Power Energy Systems - Solar Panels - Pure Energies|work=Pure Energies}}&lt;/ref&gt; A PACE loan is therefore said to be [[nonrecourse loan|nonrecourse]] to the borrower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/emerging-issues-residential-pace-loans-and-bankruptcy |title=Emerging Issues: Residential PACE Loans and Bankruptcy |website=natlawreview.com |date=2018-02-08 |accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PACE can also be used to finance leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs). In this structure, the PACE property tax assessment is used to collect a lease payment of services fee. The primary benefit of this approach is that project costs may be lower due to the provider retaining the tax incentives and passing the benefit on to the property owner as a lower lease or services payment.

PACE programs help home and business owners pay for the upfront costs of green initiatives, such as [[solar panels]], which the property owner then pays back by increasing [[property tax]]es by a set rate for an agreed-upon term ranging from 5–25 years. This allows property owners to begin saving on [[energy]] costs while they are paying for their [[solar panels]]. This usually means that property owners have net gains even with increased property tax.

==History==
Voluntary assessments for repaying [[municipal bond]]s have been attached to property taxes since the early 1800s to fund projects for public good such as sidewalks, fire stations, and street lighting.  PACE uses the same concept, but for projects that benefit the private sector, or individual building owners.   PACE was originally known as a "Special Energy Financing District" or "on-tax bill solar and efficiency financing."{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  The concept was first conceived and proposed{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} in the Monterey Bay Regional Energy Plan in 2005&lt;ref name ="PACE"&gt;{{cite report |last=Kammerer |first=Kurt |title=Monterey Bay Regional Energy Plan |url=http://www.ccag.ca.gov/pdf/USTF/docs/AMBAGPartIFINAL11April06.pdf |date=April 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but followed voter approval of a similar [[solar bonds]] program approved by San Francisco voters in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.local.org/sfproph.html|title=LOCAL POWER (November 8, 2001): San Francisco Voters Approve Unlimited Solar, Wind, Conservation with Passage of Proposition H|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was designed to overcome one of the most significant barriers to solar and costly energy efficiency retrofits: up-front costs.  A homeowner could spend tens of thousands of dollars on a solar photovoltaic system, upgrading windows to be more energy efficient or adding insulation throughout the home, yet all of these investments would not likely be recovered when the home was sold.  PACE enables the homeowner to "mortgage" these improvements and pay only for the benefits they derive while they own the home.

The first PACE program was implemented by Berkeley, California, led by Cisco DeVries, the chief of staff to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]'s [[mayor]] and then-CEO of RenewableFunding. [[University of California, Berkeley]] led the development of the program via the "Guide to Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy Financing Districts for Local Governments" contributed by Cisco DeVries, Ann Livingston and Matthew Brown. The guide was funded through grants to the City of Berkeley from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/uploadedFiles/Planning_and_Development/Level_3_-_Energy_and_Sustainable_Development/Guide%20to%20Renewable%20Energy%20Financing%20Districts2009.pdf|title=Guide to Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy Financing Districts for Local Governments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley's PACE program was recommended as an alternative to the solar bonds authority approved by neighboring San Francisco voters in 2001 in conjunction with the City's [[Community Choice Aggregation]] program, which is being implemented in both San Francisco and Sonoma counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/31896/first-marin-now-sonoma-moves-on-energy-program/|title=First Marin, now Sonoma moves on energy program|work=The North Bay Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DeVries saw PACE as a way to provide a viable means to help achieve the [[Bay Area]]'s [[climate]] goals. [[California]] passed the first [[legislation]] for PACE [[financing]] and started the BerkeleyFIRST climate program in 2008.&lt;ref name=rf /&gt;&lt;ref name=1b&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarfinancing.1bog.org/municipal-solar-financing/ |title=PACE Program (Property Assessed Clean Energy) Financing |work=1BOG.org |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, PACE-enabling legislation has been passed in 31 states and the District of Columbia, allowing localities to establish PACE financing programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Financing of Renewables and Efficiency|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/47097.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Lab|accessdate=2011-07-09|author=Speer, Bethany|author2=Koenig, Ron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, PACE financing for residential properties was dealt a serious blow in 2010 when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac refused to back mortgages with PACE liens on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hsu|first=Tiffany|title=Fannie, Freddie freeze PACE energy-efficiency retrofit financing programs|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2010/07/fannie-freddie-freeze-pace-energyefficiency-retrofit-financing-programs.html|accessdate=2011-07-09|newspaper=LA Times|date=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cchange.net/2010/05/26/keeping-pac/ Interview with Cisco Devries on Sea Change Radio], originally aired May 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) announced that it intends to require liens created by energy retrofit programs to remain subordinate to loans guaranteed by the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and that it would be issuing guidance on how to handle the transfer and sale of homes with a PACE assessment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/24/fact-sheet-president-obama-announces-new-actions-bring-renewable-energy|title=FACT SHEET: President Obama Announces New Actions to Bring Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency to Households across the Country|date=2015-08-24|website=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; HUD clarified its policy in 2017 by stating properties with PACE obligations were ineligible for FHA financing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/OCHCO/documents/17-18ml.pdf|title=ML 2017-18: Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE)|last=|first=|date=2017-12-07|website=HUD.gov|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
For a [[city]], PACE can play an important role in reducing local [[greenhouse gas]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://ygrene.com/what-is-pace Ygrene PACE, ''How the PACE program helps reduce emissions.'',July 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; emissions, promoting [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] improvements in its buildings, making the shift to [[renewable]] sources of [[energy]] more affordable, and reducing [[energy]] costs for residents and businesses. Because PACE is funded through private lending or [[municipal bonds]], it creates no liability to the city's funds. Additionally, most PACE programs made possible through public-private partnerships rely on private capital to source financing. PACE also enables states and local governments to design and implement such programs in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2012/11/13%20federalism/13%20housing%20energy%20efficiency.pdf Brookings Institution, ''Enact Legislation Supporting Residential Property Assessed Clean Energy Financing (PACE)'', November 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; PACE programs also help to create jobs and thus spur local [[economic development]] when local [[solar energy|solar]] installers and [[renewable energy]] companies partner with the program. It is also an opt-in program, so only those property owners who choose to participate are responsible for the costs of PACE financing.&lt;ref name=pn/&gt;&lt;ref name=1b/&gt;&lt;ref name=pf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacefinancing.org/|title=pacefinancing.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PACE enables individuals and businesses to defer the upfront costs that are the most common barrier to energy efficiency or renewables installations. The PACE [[loans]] are paid by additional assessments on the property owner's [[property taxes]] over an agreed upon term while [[energy economics|energy costs]] are simultaneously lower, providing the PACE consumer with net gains. Also, because the [[solar panels]] and the PACE [[loan]] is attached to the [[property]], the [[consumer]] can sell the property leaving the debt to be paid through the [[property tax]] assessed on the subsequent owners.&lt;ref name=pn/&gt;&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;&lt;ref name=1b/&gt;&lt;ref name=pf/&gt;

==Concerns for residential PACE financing==
For consumers, PACE type programs have several problems. Because the financing is designed to stay with the property, eligibility is based primarily on property information rather than income and FICO scores. A homeowner’s ability to pay is currently based primarily on their mortgage and property tax payment history as well as the requirement that there are no recent bankruptcies. Most significantly, homeowners are financed for the home improvements without any assessment of whether the financing is affordable for the homeowner, though Senate Bill 242, currently being considered in California, would require PACE providers to conduct an income review.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Prentiss|year=2011|title=Keeping PACE?: The Case Against Property Assessed Clean Energy Financing Programs|url=http://lawreview.colorado.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9.-Cox-FINAL_s.pdf|journal=University of Colorado Law Review|volume=83|pages=109–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mba.informz.net/MBA/data/images/MBA%20Summary%20of%20FHA%20PACE%20Bulletin%20Final.pdf|title=FHA’s Property Assessed Clean Energy Guidance: Preliminary MBA Analysis|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Mortgage Bankers Association|access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB242|title=Bill Text - SB-242 Property Assessed Clean Energy program: program administrator.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the PACE financing is structured as a tax assessment instead of a loan, the PACE programs historically have not had to provide to homeowners the same disclosures about the financing costs that traditional lenders must provide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In September 2016, California Governor Jerry Brown signed AB2693 into law, which required PACE programs to provide mortgage-level disclosures and some providers to conduct live recorded calls with the homeowner to confirm financing terms and obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/2016/10/07/consumer-protections-for-pace-now-written-into-state-law/|title=Consumer Protections for PACE Now Written into State Law|last=Register|first=James Reed {{!}} Orange County|date=2016-10-07|website=Orange County Register|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, without either an assessment of affordability or these disclosures about the costs of the financing, homeowners depend on what the PACE program providers tell them when trying to figure out whether the financing is affordable. Homeowners have complained that PACE contractors are lying about the costs of financing as part of selling the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=grindall61|title=THE CALIFORNIA HERO SOLAR PANEL PROGRAM HAS BEEN EXPOSED AS A MASSIVE SCAM TO SCREW YOU.|date=2016-05-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKdPMv257Wg|accessdate=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These problems create a situation in which homeowners can suddenly owe far more in property taxes than they can afford to repay; this is especially true for retired and disabled homeowners on fixed incomes. PACE architects Cisco DeVries and Matthew Brown deny these claims as "isolated incidents." 

Interest rates for PACE programs are usually 3-4% higher than for traditional mortgage loans, with additional administrative fees close to 5%, &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but compare well to many lending options such as credit cards and [[Home equity line of credit|HELOCs]], without tying up credit lines. 

Many buyers and sellers have had difficulty with sales of homes with PACE tax assessments. Though the PACE assessment typically appears on the title report, some buyers find out about the assessments after the sale, which may force them to pay money out-of-pocket unexpectedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/hero-761687-realtors-property.html|title=MORENO VALLEY: Homebuyer files lawsuit over HERO-financed transaction|last=GRUSZECKI|first=DEBRA|newspaper=Press Enterprise|language=en|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, sellers have agreed to pay off the PACE assessment or lower the sale price to compensate for the PACE tax assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pe.com/common/printer/view.php?db=pressenterprise&amp;id=758344|title=Print Article: INLAND: Realtors offer word of warning about solar financing program|website=www.pe.com|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pe.com/common/printer/view.php?db=pressenterprise&amp;id=768927|title=Print Article: Riverside County DA investigating how contractors pitch HERO program|website=www.pe.com|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/science-environment/some-homeowners-looking-to-move-must-deal-with-a-change-of-pace/|title=PACE Loans Can Throw a Wrench in Home Sales|date=2015-06-22|newspaper=Voice of San Diego|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the remaining payments are unable to be assumed by the new buyer, this renders the PACE financing to a position more similar to that of a traditional lending product.

A problem with PACE for both residential lenders and consumers is that the tax liens for PACE financing take priority over other lien-holders, and those lien-holders may not be notified or given an opportunity to object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/hero-761687-realtors-property.html|title=MORENO VALLEY: Homebuyer files lawsuit over HERO-financed transaction|last=GRUSZECKI|first=DEBRA|newspaper=Press Enterprise|language=en|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/hero-758344-program-home.html|title=INLAND: Realtors offer word of warning about solar financing program|last=GRUSZECKI|first=DEBRA|newspaper=Press Enterprise|language=en|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial PACE is less problematic because priority lien-holders for those properties are notified before hand.

== Securitization ==
Bonds associated with PACE assessments can be packaged and securitized. [[Securitization]], which was developed in the mortgage industry, works by pooling a series of assets, such as mortgages, and selling notes backed by these assets to investors. Because these bonds are for property improvements which achieve a positive environmental impact, some PACE providers have had their bonds green certified. PACE bonds are unique amongst the green bond market because products rated as efficient are reducing carbon emissions as soon as they are installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pace-bond-abs-idUSL1N0M41J920140307|title=First energy-efficiency bonds sold to investors|date=2014-03-07|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://strattonreport.com/news/renovate-america-gets-green-bond-certification-pace-securitizations/|title=Renovate America gets green bond certification for all of its PACE securitizations - Stratton Report|website=Stratton Report|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/pace-roundp-150m-securitization-by-ygrene-clean-fund-closes-60m|title=PACE Roundup: $150M Securitization by Ygrene, Clean Fund Closes $60M|website=www.greentechmedia.com|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phospholipids]] are the primary lipids composing [[cellular membrane]]s.  Phospholipids can be [[Saponification|saponified]], which releases the [[fatty acids]] contained in their [[diglyceride]] tail.  Once the phospholipids of an unknown sample are saponified, the composition of the resulting PLFA can be compared to the PLFA of known organisms to determine the identity of the sample organism. PLFA analysis may be combined with other techniques, such as [[stable isotope probing]] to determine which microbes are metabolically active in a sample.  PLFA analysis was pioneered by D.C. White, MD, PhD,&lt;ref name = "Morris"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ismej.2008.65|pmid=18563187|title=On the contributions of David Cleaveland White, MD, PhD to microbial ecology: Celebrating the life of a pioneer|journal=The ISME Journal|volume=2|issue=8|pages=797–804|year=2008|last1=Morris|first1=Brandon EL|last2=Crable|first2=Bryan R|last3=Suflita|first3=Joseph M}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Tennessee, in the early to mid 1980s.

==Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis==

[[phospholipids|Phospholipid]] fatty acids (PLFA) are an essential structural component of all microbial [[cell membrane|cellular membranes]].  PLFA analysis is a technique widely used for estimation of the total [[biomass]] and to observe broad changes in the community composition of the living microbiota of soil and aqueous environments.  There has been a surge of interest in PLFAs in recent years, evident from the large increase in peer-reviewed journal references on the subject.&lt;ref name="Frostegard"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2010.11.021|title=Use and misuse of PLFA measurements in soils|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|volume=43|issue=8|pages=1621–1625|year=2011|last1=Frostegård|first1=Åsa|last2=Tunlid|first2=Anders|last3=Bååth|first3=Erland}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is increasing concern that some researchers are assigning PLFAs to specific microbial classes when in fact those PLFAs are present in a broad range of life forms.&lt;ref name="Frostegard" /&gt;  Phospholipids can occur in many biological classes (such as in plant roots, fungi, as well as in soil bacteria), so care has to be taken in over-assigning PLFA biomarkers to the wrong class.  Even though phospholipids occur in many different life forms, the fatty acid side chains between differing life forms can be quite unique.  Polyunsaturated fatty acids (''e.g.'' 18:3 ω3c) are found in plants, algae and cyanobacteria, but are often not present in bacteria.  Monounsaturated fatty acids (particularly at the omega-7 position), odd-chain saturated fatty acids (''e.g.'' 15:0), branched-chain fatty acids (mainly iso/anetiso and 10-methyl) and cyclopropane fatty acids (''e.g.'' 19:0 cyclo ω7c) are mostly synthesized by bacteria.  The monounsaturated fatty acid, 16:1 ω5c, is mostly synthesized by [[Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi|Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)]] and the polyunsaturated fatty acid, 18:2 ω6c ([[Linoleic acid]]), is mostly synthesized by [[Fungi|Ectomycorrhizal fungi]].

The basic premise is that as individual organisms (especially bacteria and fungi) die, phospholipids are rapidly degraded and the remaining phospholipid content of the sample is assumed to be from living organisms.  As the phospholipids of different groups of bacteria and fungi contain a variety of somewhat unusual [[fatty acids]], they can serve as useful biomarkers for such groups.  PLFA profiles and composition can be determined by purifying the phospholipids and then cleaving the fatty acids for further analysis.  Knowledge of the composition and metabolic activity of the [[soil microbiology|microbiota]] in soils, water and waste materials is useful in optimizing crop production, in [[bioremediation]] and in understanding [[microbial ecology|microbial ecosystems]].  Soil microbial community analysis by PLFA has been a widely used technique due to the sensitive, reproducible measurement of the dominant portions of the soil microbiota and the fact that PLFA does not require cultivation of the organisms.&lt;ref name="Kaur"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kaur A, Chaudhary A, Kaur A, Choudhary R, Kaushik R |title=Phospholipid fatty acid - A bioindicator of environmental monitoring and assessment in soil ecosystem |journal=Current Science |date=2005 |volume=89 |issue=7 |pages=1103–1112 |url=http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/oct102005/1103.pdf |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sampling of soil populations by culturing has proven not cost effective and results in biased results due to the differing ease of culturing of some organisms.  The main drawback of PLFA has been that the extraction time is very long and cumbersome.  A new 96-well plate PLFA extraction procedure has been developed which represents a 4-to-5 fold increase in throughput over traditional PLFA extraction methods.   This new method, coupled to new software tools for analyzing the PLFA data, will be useful to laboratories performing large numbers of PLFA analyses, or for laboratories wanting to begin PLFA research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.apsoil.2012.06.005|title=High throughput phospholipid fatty acid analysis of soils|journal=Applied Soil Ecology|volume=61|pages=127–130|year=2012|last1=Buyer|first1=Jeffrey S.|last2=Sasser|first2=Myron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background of PLFA analysis===

Early studies of the living soil microbial communities were largely based on attempts at culturing bacteria and fungi of soil.  However, due to difficulty in culturing many of the organisms, the differential growth rates of the organisms, and labor involved, this proved to be not satisfactory.  A 1965 article proposed using molecules produced by the organisms as biomarkers for the microbial communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=5876245|year=1965|author1=Zuckerkandl|first1=E|title=Molecules as documents of evolutionary history|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=8|issue=2|pages=357–66|last2=Pauling|first2=L|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(65)90083-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following two decades, rapid progress was made in development of [[gas chromatograph]]s (GC) and of fused silica capillary columns for the GC instruments, enabling better analysis of [[biological]] materials, including [[fatty acid methyl esters]] (FAMEs).  PLFA analysis can be used for microbial community structure and activity through the use of “signature” fatty acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=White DC |chapter=Analysis of microorganisms in terms of quantity and activity in natural environments |title=Microbes in Their Natural Environment |editor1=Slater JHW |editor2=Wimpenny R |date=1983 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic concept is that the phospholipid content represents living organisms as these compounds are rapidly decomposed in aerobic mixed communities and that some of the neutral lipid components such as the [[lipopolysaccharides]] of Gram-negative [[bacteria]] do not reflect organisms alive at the time of sampling.

===PLFA sample preparation===

Although the method of sample collection is different for soil, water samples, etc., the extraction-derivatization is generally similar to the following protocol from an article on soil microbial communities.&lt;ref name="Blackwood"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15224917|year=2004|author1=Blackwood|first1=C. B.|title=Soil microbial communities associated with Bt and non-Bt corn in three soils|journal=Journal of environmental quality|volume=33|issue=3|pages=832–6|last2=Buyer|first2=J. S.|doi=10.2134/jeq2004.0832|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=9123&amp;content=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lipids were extracted from the dried soil sample by use of a chloroform-methanol-phosphate buffer mixture by use of a brief sonication followed by shaking for 2 hours and centrifugation to pellet the soil material.  The liquid above the soil had additional chloroform and water added to cause separation of the lipid-containing chloroform from the buffer/methanol phase.  The lipids were fractionated on a solid-phase extraction column and the neutral lipids, free fatty acids and other materials discarded and the phospholipid phase then dried, prior esterification to form the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)&lt;ref name="Blackwood" /&gt; to make them suitable for analysis.

===Analysis of FAMEs===

Analysis by gas chromatography (GC) is the method of choice for FAME analysis. The GC is coupled with either a mass spectrometer detector (MSD) or a flame ionization detector (FID).  The GC-MSD system is more expensive to purchase and to maintain as well as requiring considerable skill in operation.  Identification of fatty acids using the GC-FID system is dependent on comparison of retention times of the compounds in comparison to purchased standards of fatty acid esters.  A commercially available, fatty-acid based microbial identification system (using GC-FID), which reproducibly names and quantitates the FAMEs, has been widely adopted for PLFA analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Piotrowska-Seget Z, Mrozik A |title=Signature lipid biomarker (SLB) analysis in determining changes in community structure of soil microorganisms |journal=Polish J Environ Stud |date=2003 |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=669–75 |url=http://www.pjoes.com/abstracts/2003/Vol12/No06/02.html |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The PLFA components of soil microbiota==

'''[[Actinomycetes]]''' are Gram-positive bacteria that are some of the most common bacteria in soil, freshwater and marine environments.  Actinomycetes are active in decomposition of organic matter and give rise to the rich “earthy” smell of freshly tilled soils.  This group of bacteria produce distinctive biomarker fatty acids having a methyl branch at the 10th carbon, such as 16:0 10-methyl and 18:0 10-methyl.&lt;ref name="Frostegard2"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Frostegard A, Tunlid A, Baath E |title=Phospholipid Fatty Acid composition, biomass, and activity of microbial communities from two soil types experimentally exposed to different heavy metals |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |date=1993 |volume=59 |issue=11 |pages=3605–17 |url=http://aem.asm.org/content/59/11/3605.abstract |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some common species of soil actinomycetes include ''Rhodococcus, Nocardia, Corynebacterium ''and'' Streptomyces. ''

'''[[Gram-positive bacteria]]''' include aerobic ''Bacillus'' species especially those related to ''B. cereus ''and to'' B. subtilis.''  These bacteria are common in the bulk soil and increase in numbers in the rhizosphere.  The PLFA profiles of these Gram-positive species have high percentages of biomarker branched-chain fatty acids such as 15:0 iso and 15:0 anteiso.  Thus, the sum of the iso and anteiso fatty acids in a PLFA analysis may provide an estimate of the abundance of the Gram-positive bacteria (other than actinomycetes) in the sample.

'''[[Gram-negative bacteria]]''' are a major component of the plant rhizosphere and improve plant growth by increasing solubility of phosphate, producing ionophore compounds that increase uptake of iron or other minerals and may produce antifungal compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16832725|year=2006|author1=Pandey|first1=A|title=Characterization of a phosphate solubilizing and antagonistic strain of Pseudomonas putida (B0) isolated from a sub-alpine location in the Indian Central Himalaya|journal=Current Microbiology|volume=53|issue=2|pages=102–7|last2=Trivedi|first2=P|last3=Kumar|first3=B|last4=Palni|first4=L. M.|doi=10.1007/s00284-006-4590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gram-negative bacteria produce high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (''e.g.'' 16:1 omega-7 and 18:1 omega-9) during active metabolism but convert much of the unsaturated fatty acid composition to cyclopropane fatty acids (''e.g.'' 17:0 cyclopropane and 19:0 cyclopropane) when metabolism and cell division slow due to shortage of nutrition or other stress.  Thus, in PLFA analysis, the sum of monounsaturated and cyclopropane fatty acids may provide an estimate of the abundance of Gram-negative bacteria. A high ratio of cyclopropane to monounsaturated fatty acid indicates stress conditions.&lt;ref name="Kaur" /&gt;

'''[[Anaerobic bacteria]]''' in agriculture are primarily a factor in soils of low oxygen levels such as occur in greater depths or of wet conditions such as in rice paddies.  Using PLFA analysis in early sampling, the bacteria- archaea consortia in rice paddy soil was about 44% aerobic bacteria, 32% facultatively anaerobic- bacteria and 24% archaea.  Under longer term flooding, the levels were 27%, 36% and 37% respectively and with total biomass being significantly lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10882432|year=2000|author1=Bai|first1=Q|title=Characterization of Microbial Consortia in Paddy Rice Soil by Phospholipid Analysis|journal=Microbial ecology|volume=39|issue=4|pages=273–281|last2=Gattinger|first2=A|last3=Zelles|first3=L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dimethyl acetals (DMA) formed during derivatization are considered to be biomarkers of anaerobic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s003740050533|title=Fatty acid patterns of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides in the characterisation of microbial communities in soil: A review|journal=Biology and Fertility of Soils|volume=29|issue=2|pages=111–129|year=1999|last1=Zelles|first1=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[arbuscular mycorrhiza|Arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi]]''' (AMF) penetrate the walls of cortical cells of about 80% of all vascular plant families, generating a symbiotic relationship.  The fungi form membrane structures adjacent to the plant cell membrane allowing exchange of phosphorus, nitrogen compounds and minerals from the fungus and the plant provides the fungus primarily with photosynthesis-derived sugars.  As the AMF are obligate symbiotic fungi, they are not free-living in the soil.  The AMF hyphae in the root form lipid materials which then are transported to the hyphae that extend into the soil from the root and thus may occur in a soil sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10364411|pmc=59298|year=1999|author1=Pfeffer|first1=P.

==Applications of PLFA analysis==

Sampling of agricultural soils for analysis of chemical composition (''e.g.'' pH, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, ''etc''.) has long been practiced in crop production and while there has been recognition of the importance of the soil microbiota, tools for studying the microbiota have been developed relatively recently.

===High value vegetable crops===

Many high-value vegetable crops easily justify soil testing both for chemical content and the soil microbiota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2010.01.020|title=Factors affecting soil microbial community structure in tomato cropping systems|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|volume=42|issue=5|pages=831–841|year=2010|last1=Buyer|first1=Jeffrey S.|last2=Teasdale|first2=John R.|last3=Roberts|first3=Daniel P.|last4=Zasada|first4=Inga A.|last5=Maul|first5=Jude E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conventional, low-input and organic farming systems showed a rapid response of the soil microbial communities to wet/dry cycles and that increases in bacterial cyclopropyl fatty acids were useful to detect periods of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0038-0717(99)00080-2|title=Rapid response of soil microbial communities from conventional, low input, and organic farming systems to a wet/dry cycle|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1661–1675|year=1999|last1=Lundquist|first1=E.J|last2=Scow|first2=K.M|last3=Jackson|first3=L.E|last4=Uesugi|first4=S.L|last5=Johnson|first5=C.R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lines of transgenic corn (maize) expressing ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' endotoxins were found to have small effect on soil microbial communities when compared by PLFA analysis to their non-transgenic isolines.&lt;ref name="Blackwood" /&gt;  Successful exotic invasive plant species can have profound effects on the microbial communities of the soil &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[3152:EPSATM]2.0.CO;2|year=2002|volume=83|issue=11|pages=3152–3166|title=Exotic Plant Species Alter the Microbial Community Structure and Function in the Soil|journal=Ecology|last1=Kourtev|first1=Peter S.|last2=Ehrenfeld|first2=Joan G.|last3=Häggblom|first3=Max}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps thus improving their competitiveness.  Grassland restoration practices of tillage, weeding and herbicide use showed an impact on microbial communities of the upper soil but very small changes on the microbiota of lower soil layers and that after 4 years of recovery the communities were very similar to untreated plots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.12.009|title=Soil microbial community composition as affected by restoration practices in California grassland|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|volume=38|issue=7|pages=1851–1860|year=2006|last1=Potthoff|first1=Martin|last2=Steenwerth|first2=Kerri L.|last3=Jackson|first3=Louise E.|last4=Drenovsky|first4=Rebecca E.|last5=Scow|first5=Kate M.|last6=Joergensen|first6=Rainer G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phytoplankton===

[[Phytoplankton]] (eukaryotic algae) are microscopic photosynthesizing plants that inhabit the sunlit layers of oceans and bodies of freshwater.  As the primary source of elaborated carbon compounds, they are vital to the aquatic food web.  Phytoplankton produce considerable amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including [[Eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA, 20:5 w3c), with [[microalgae]] being the origin of [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s in fish oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14499126|year=2003|author1=Wen|first1=Z. Y.|title=Heterotrophic production of eicosapentaenoic acid by microalgae|journal=Biotechnology Advances|volume=21|issue=4|pages=273–94|last2=Chen|first2=F|doi=10.1016/s0734-9750(03)00051-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The diverse taxonomic groups in algae vary in abundance dependent on environmental conditions such as temperature, salinity, sunlight, and nutrient availability.  The PLFA biomarker compositions were found to enable determination of the prevalence of the major groups in several marine environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3354/meps324113|title=Phospholipid-derived fatty acids as chemotaxonomic markers for phytoplankton: Application for inferring phytoplankton composition|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=324|pages=113–125|year=2006|last1=Dijkman|first1=NA|last2=Kromkamp|first2=JC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a study of reservoir sedimentary deposits, an assumption was made that the community PUFA content constituted ''ca''. 50% of the total microeukaryotic PLFAs.&lt;ref name = "Smoot"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12024260|year=2001|author1=Smoot|first1=J.

===Aquatic environments===

In contrast to the considerable microbial diversity in soils, free-living microbes distributed by marine currents and exposed to algal exudates exhibit global distributions for a few dominant microbial groups of relatively few species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12089052|pmc=126765|year=2002|author1=Hagström|first1=A|title=Use of 16S ribosomal DNA for delineation of marine bacterioplankton species|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|volume=68|issue=7|pages=3628–33|last2=Pommier|first2=T|last3=Rohwer|first3=F|last4=Simu|first4=K|last5=Stolte|first5=W|last6=Svensson|first6=D|last7=Zweifel|first7=U.

===Forestry===

[[Coniferous forest]]s are dependent on available nutrients in soil rather than agricultural fertilizers and thus are routinely colonized by symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi.  The mycorrhizae may be ectomycorrhizae (EMF) and/or arbuscular (AMF) in type in the forest.&lt;ref name = "Nilsson"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15720671|year=2005|author1=Nilsson|first1=L.

===Composting===

[[Composting]] of organic materials is the microbial degradation of heterogeneous organic material under moist, self-heating, aerobic conditions.  Initially, activity by [[mesophilic]] organisms leads to a rapid rise in temperature, followed by [[thermophilic]] organisms dominating the degradation process leading to a cooling period in which mesophilic bacteria again dominate populations.  A commercial FAME extraction protocol developed for identification of bacteria, a mild alkaline methanolysis protocol and PLFA-extraction/derivatization were compared for effectiveness.&lt;ref name = "Steger"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14529958|year=2003|author1=Steger|first1=K|title=Comparison of signature lipid methods to determine microbial community structure in compost|journal=Journal of microbiological methods|volume=55|issue=2|pages=371–82|last2=Jarvis|first2=A|last3=Smårs|first3=S|last4=Sundh|first4=I|doi=10.1016/s0167-7012(03)00187-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PLFA protocol gave the most detailed information about community succession, however, the other two protocols were much simpler and appeared suitable for analysis of microbial FAME profiles in compost.&lt;ref name = "Steger" /&gt;

===Wastewater treatment===

[[Activated sludge]] technology is the most widely used method for wastewater treatment.  Complex microbial communities in activated sludge processes are needed for the stable removal efficiency of organic pollutants.  PLFA analysis can be used to monitor the microbial community composition of activated sludge reactors, which microbial groups are predominant, and the efficiency of such systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21633845|year=2012|author1=Yi|first1=T|title=Structure and dynamics of microbial community in full-scale activated sludge reactors|journal=Journal of Industrial Microbiology &amp; Biotechnology|volume=39|issue=1|pages=19–25|last2=Lee|first2=E.

'''Renewable energy''' is energy that is collected from [[renewable resource]]s, which are naturally replenished on a [[Orders of magnitude (time)|human timescale]], such as [[sunlight]], [[wind power|wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal power|tides]], [[wave power|waves]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellabban | first1 = Omar | last2 = Abu-Rub | first2 = Haitham | last3 = Blaabjerg | first3 = Frede | year = 2014 | title = Renewable energy resources: Current status, future prospects and their enabling technology | url = | journal = [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 748–764 [749] | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: [[electricity generation]], [[space heating|air]] and [[water heating]]/[[air conditioning|cooling]], [[transportation]], and [[Stand-alone power system|rural (off-grid)]] energy services.&lt;ref name=ren15&gt;REN21 (2010).

Based on [[REN21]]'s 2017 report, renewables contributed 19.3% to humans' [[World energy consumption|global energy consumption]] and 24.5% to their generation of electricity in 2015 and 2016, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 8.9% coming from [[Biofuel#traditional|traditional biomass]], 4.2% as heat energy (modern biomass, geothermal and solar heat), 3.9% hydro electricity and 2.2% is electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and [[Biofuel|biomass]]. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$286 billion in 2015, with countries such as [[Renewable energy in China|China]] and the [[Renewable energy in the United States|United States]] heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;[[REN21]], [http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_FullReport_.pdf Global Status Report 2016]. Retrieved 8th June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, there are an estimated 7.7 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with [[solar photovoltaics]] being the largest renewable employer.&lt;ref&gt;[[IRENA]], [http://www.irena.org/menu/index.aspx?mnu=Subcat&amp;PriMenuID=36&amp;CatID=141&amp;SubcatID=585 Renewable energy and jobs], ''Annual review 2015'', IRENA.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015 worldwide, more than half of all new electricity capacity installed was renewable.&lt;ref name=guardianiea2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/renewables-made-up-half-of-net-electricity-capacity-added-last-year|title=Renewables made up half of net electricity capacity added last year|first=Adam|last=Vaughan|date=25 October 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to [[Non-renewable energy|other energy sources]], which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] is resulting in significant [[Energy security and renewable technology|energy security]], [[climate change mitigation]], and economic benefits.&lt;ref name="International Energy Agency 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/ETP2012SUM.pdf |title=Energy Technology Perspectives 2012 |author= International Energy Agency |year=2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of a recent review of the literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heidari | first1 = Negin | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | year = 2016 | title = A Review of Greenhouse Gas Emission Liabilities as the Value of Renewable Energy for Mitigating Lawsuits for Climate Change Related Damages | url = https://www.academia.edu/19418589/A_Review_of_Greenhouse_Gas_Emission_Liabilities_as_the_Value_of_Renewable_Energy_for_Mitigating_Lawsuits_for_Climate_Change_Related_Damages | journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews | volume = 55C | issue = | pages = 899–908 | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2015.11.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that as [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emitters begin to be held liable for damages resulting from GHG emissions resulting in climate change, a high value for liability mitigation would provide powerful incentives for deployment of renewable energy technologies.  In international [[public opinion surveys]] there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power.&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond.&lt;ref name="REN21 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.ren21.net/Portals/0/REN21_GFR_2013_print.pdf |title=Renewables global futures report 2013 |author=REN21 |year=2013 |work= }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some places and at least two countries, Iceland and Norway generate all their electricity using renewable energy already, and many other countries have the set a goal to reach [[100% renewable energy]] in the future. For example, in [[Denmark]] the government decided to [[Energy transition|switch the total energy supply]] (electricity, mobility and heating/cooling) to 100% renewable energy by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vad Mathiesen | first1 = Brian | authorlink = Brian Vad Mathiesen | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = Smart Energy Systems for coherent 100% renewable energy and transport solutions | url = | journal = [[Applied Energy]] | volume = 145 | issue = | pages = 139–154 | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many renewable energy projects are large-scale, renewable technologies are also suited to [[rural]] and remote areas and [[Renewable energy in developing countries|developing countries]], where energy is often crucial in [[Human development (humanity)|human development]].&lt;ref&gt;World Energy Assessment (2001).

Technologie – Berechnung – Simulation''. 8th. Edition. Hanser (Munich) 2013, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy systems are rapidly becoming more efficient and cheaper.  Their share of total energy consumption is increasing.  Growth in consumption of coal and oil could end by 2020 due to increased uptake of renewables and natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/02/electric-cars-cheap-solar-power-halt-fossil-fuel-growth-2020 Electric cars and cheap solar 'could halt fossil fuel growth by 2020'] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carbontracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Expect-the-Unexpected_CTI_Imperial.pdf pg3 &amp; pg30&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, small solar PV systems provide electricity to a few million households, and micro-hydro configured into mini-grids serves many more. Over 44 million households use [[biogas]] made in household-scale digesters for [[lighting]] and/or [[cooking]], and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves.&lt;ref name="REN21 2011 14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR2011_FINAL.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Nations]]' Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity.&lt;ref name="renewableenergyworld1"/&gt; At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond, and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy, including a 20% target of all electricity generated for the European Union by 2020. Some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100% renewables. Outside Europe, a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 2020–2030 time frame that range from 10% to 50%.&lt;ref name="REN21 2013"/&gt;

Renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas: [[electricity generation]], [[Solar water heating|hot water]]/[[space heating]], [[transportation]], and rural (off-grid) energy services:&lt;ref name="ren15" /&gt;
* '''Power generation'''
: By 2040, renewable energy is projected to equal coal and natural gas electricity generation. Several jurisdictions, including Denmark, Germany, the state of South Australia and some US states have achieved high integration of variable renewables. For example, in 2015 wind power met 42% of electricity demand in Denmark, 23.2% in Portugal and 15.5% in Uruguay. Interconnectors enable countries to balance electricity systems by allowing the import and export of renewable energy. Innovative hybrid systems have emerged between countries and regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=REN21|title=Renewables 2016: Global Status Report|url=http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report.pdf|website=Renewable Energy Policy Network|accessdate=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Heating'''
: [[Solar water heating]] makes an important contribution to [[renewable heat]] in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180 GWth). Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China. Worldwide, total installed [[solar water heating]] systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households. The use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well. In Sweden, national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil. Direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly.&lt;ref name=ren53&gt;REN21 (2010).

* '''Transportation'''
[[File:Soybeanbus.jpg|thumb|A bus fueled by [[biodiesel]]]]

:[[Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|USA]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. [[Biodiesel]] can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common [[biofuel]] in Europe.

:A [[solar vehicle]] is an [[electric vehicle]] powered completely or significantly by direct [[solar energy]]. Usually, [[photovoltaic]] (PV) cells contained in [[solar panel]]s convert the [[sun]]'s energy directly into [[electric energy]]. The term "solar vehicle" usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicle's [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion]]. [[Solar power]] may be also used to provide power for communications or controls or other auxiliary functions. Solar vehicles are not sold as practical day-to-day transportation devices at present, but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises, often sponsored by government agencies. However, indirectly solar-charged vehicles are widespread and [[Electric boat|solar boats]] are available commercially.

== History ==

Prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century, nearly all energy used was renewable. Almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy, in the form of traditional [[biomass]] to fuel fires, dates from 790,000 years ago. Use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later, sometime between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Fire&gt;{{cite web|title=The Discovery of Fire|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/ancientdailylife/qt/fire_control.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=15 January 2013|author=K. Kris Hirst}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water. This practice can be traced back some 7000 years, to ships in the Persian Gulf&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2017|title="Blowin’ the wind"|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=11|issue=1|pages=63–67/83|doi=10.1109/MIE.2017.2652798|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the Nile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=wind energy|work=[[The Encyclopedia of Alternative Energy and Sustainable Living]]|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/W/AE_wind_energy.html|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving into the time of recorded history, the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human [[Manual labour|labor]], [[animal power]], [[water power]], wind, in grain crushing [[windmill]]s,&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt; and [[firewood]], a traditional biomass. A graph of energy use in the United States up until 1900 shows oil and natural gas with about the same importance in 1900 as wind and solar played in 2010.

In the 1860s and '70s there were already fears that civilization would run out of fossil fuels and the need was felt for a better source. In 1873 Professor [[Augustin Mouchot]] wrote:&lt;ref name="guarnieri 6-1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2016|title=A Shining Tale|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=10|issue=4|pages=67–69/80|doi=10.1109/MIE.2016.2616000|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The time will arrive when the industry of Europe will cease to find those natural resources, so necessary for it. Petroleum springs and coal mines are not inexhaustible but are rapidly diminishing in many places.  Will man, then, return to the power of water and wind? Or will he emigrate where the most powerful source of heat sends its rays to all?  History will show what will come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224235659/http://sustainablehistory.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/the-surprising-history-of-sustainable-energy/|archivedate=24 December 2014|deadurl=no|url=https://sustainablehistory.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/the-surprising-history-of-sustainable-energy|title=The surprising history of sustainable energy |publisher=Sustainablehistory.wordpress.com |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1885, [[Werner von Siemens]], commenting on the discovery of the [[photovoltaic effect]] in the solid state, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In conclusion, I would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be, its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost, and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Werner von Siemens|title=On the electromotive action of illuminated selenium, discovered by Mr. Fritts, of New York|journal=Van Nostrands Engineering Magazine|date=1885|volume=32|pages=514–516}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Max Weber]] mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his [[Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus]], published in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Weber suggests that the modern economic world will determine the lifestyle of everyone born into it "until the last [[hundredweight]] of fossil fuel is burned" (''[http://www.zeno.org/Soziologie/M/Weber,+Max/Schriften+zur+Religionssoziologie/Die+protestantische+Ethik+und+der+Geist+des+Kapitalismus/II.+Die+Berufsethik+des+asketischen+Protestantismus/2.+Askese+und+kapitalistischer+Geist bis der letzte Zentner fossilen Brennstoffs verglüht ist]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I. The importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article: "in the far distant future, [[Fossil fuel|natural fuels]] having been exhausted [solar power] will remain as the only means of existence of the human race".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/12-105.pdf "Power from Sunshine": A Business History of Solar Energy] 25 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of [[peak oil]] was published in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |title=Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels |author=Hubbert, M.

Solar had long been used for heating and cooling, but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarstartechnologies.com/id69.html |title=History of PV Solar |publisher=Solarstartechnologies.com |accessdate=1 November 2012| archivedate=6 December 2013|deadurl=yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131206133548/http://solarstartechnologies.com/id69.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IEA 2014 World Energy Outlook projects a growth of renewable energy supply from 1,700 gigawatts in 2014 to 4,550 gigawatts in 2040. Fossil fuels received about $550 billion in subsidies in 2013, compared to $120 billion for all renewable energies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/fossil-fuels/in-2040-fossil-fuels-still-reign|title=In 2040, Fossil Fuels Still Reign|last=Tweed|first=Katherine|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This section is for a basic description of the main renewable energy technologies. New and emerging technologies should be added to the section towards the end of the article. Pros and cons of different technologies are discussed in [[Renewable energy debate]]. Thanks. --&gt;

=== Wind power ===
{{Main article|Wind power}}
[[File:Shepherds Flat Wind Farm 2011.jpg|thumb|The 845{{nbsp}}MW [[Shepherds Flat Wind Farm]] near [[Arlington, Oregon]], US]]

Airflows can be used to run [[wind turbine]]s. Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600&amp;nbsp;kW to 5 MW of rated power, although turbines with rated output of 1.5–3 MW have become the most common for commercial use. The largest generator capacity of a single installed onshore wind turbine reached 7.5 MW in 2015. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine.&lt;ref name="EWEA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Analysis of Wind Energy in the EU-25 | publisher = European Wind Energy Association | url = http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/WETF/Facts_Summary.pdf |format= PDF | accessdate = 11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high [[altitude]] sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typically [[Capacity factor|full load hours]] of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually, but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Kaltschmitt]], Wolfgang Streicher, Andreas Wiese (eds.): ''Erneuerbare Energien. Systemtechnik, Wirtschaftlichkeit, Umweltaspekte''. Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg 2013, p. 819.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%.

Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land stationed turbines.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;Offshore stations experience mean wind speeds at 80 m that are 90% greater than over land on average.&lt;/cite&gt; [http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/winds/global_winds.html Evaluation of global wind power]&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;Overall, the researchers calculated winds at 80 meters [300 feet] above [[sea level]] traveled over the ocean at approximately 8.6 meters per second and at nearly 4.5 meters per second over land [20 and 10 miles per hour, respectively].&lt;/cite&gt;" [http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/may2005/2005-05-17-09.asp#anchor6 Global Wind Map Shows Best Wind Farm Locations].

=== Hydropower ===
{{Main article|Hydroelectricity|Hydropower|}}
[[File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|thumb|The [[Three Gorges Dam]] on the [[Yangtze River]] in China]]

In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since water is about 800 times [[Density of air|denser than air]], even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea [[Swell (ocean)|swell]], can yield considerable amounts of energy. There are many forms of water energy:
* Historically hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs, which are still popular in third world countries. The largest of which is the [[Three Gorges Dam]](2003) in [[China]] and the [[Itaipu Dam]](1984) built by Brazil and Paraguay.
* [[Small hydro]] systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to {{nowrap|50 MW}} of power. They are often used on small rivers or as a low impact development on larger rivers. China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small hydro installations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/RE_Technologies_Cost_Analysis-HYDROPOWER.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]] plants derive energy from rivers without the creation of a large [[reservoir]]. The water is typically conveyed along the side of the river valley (using channels, pipes and/or tunnels) until it is high above the valley floor, whereupon it can allowed to fall through a penstock to drive a turbine. This style of generation may still produce a large amount of electricity, such as the [[Chief Joseph Dam]] on the Columbia river in the United States.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. For countries having the [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|largest percentage]] of electricity from renewables, the top 50 are primarily hydroelectric. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than 10 GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wave power]], which captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and [[tidal power]], converting the energy of tides, are two forms of hydropower with future potential; however, they are not yet widely employed commercially. A demonstration project operated by the [[Ocean Renewable Power Company]] on the coast of [[Maine]], and connected to the grid, harnesses tidal power from the [[Bay of Fundy]], location of world's highest tidal flow. [[Ocean thermal energy conversion]], which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters, currently has no economic feasibility.

[[Solar energy]], radiant [[light]] and [[heat]] from the [[sun]], is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as [[solar heating]], [[photovoltaics]], [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP), [[concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV), [[solar architecture]] and [[artificial photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=ie11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Fuels and Artificial Photosynthesis|work=Royal Society of Chemistry |year=2012 |url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Policy/Documents/solar-fuels.asp|accessdate= 11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]]. Active solar technologies encompass [[solar thermal energy]], using [[Solar thermal collector|solar collectors]] for heating, and [[solar power]], converting [[sunlight]] into [[electricity]] either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), or indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP).

A [[photovoltaic system]] converts light into electrical [[direct current]] (DC) by taking advantage of the [[photoelectric effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Sources: Solar|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysources/solar.htm|work=Department of Energy|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion, [[growth of photovoltaics|fast-growing]] industry, continues to improve its cost-effectiveness, and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with CSP.&lt;ref&gt;NREL.gov [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/51946.pdf U.S. Renewable Energy Technical Potentials: A GIS-Based Analysis], July 2013 {{rp|iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;thinkprogress.org [http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/07/30/606271/national-renewable-energy-laboratory-solar-has-the-most-potential-of-any-renewable-energy-source/ National Renewable Energy Laboratory: Solar Has The Most Potential Of Any Renewable Energy Source], 30 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. [[Solar thermal energy#Dish designs|CSP-Stirling]] has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies.

In 2011, the [[International Energy Agency]] said that "the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance [[sustainability]], reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating [[climate change]], and keep [[fossil fuel]] prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared".&lt;ref name=ie11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |title=Solar Energy Perspectives: Executive Summary |year=2011 |format=PDF |publisher=International Energy Agency |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63fIHKr1S?url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has the largest proportion of solar electricity in the world, in 2015 solar supplied 7.8% of electricity demand in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/REN21_GSR2016_FullReport_en_11.pdf pg64&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, after another year of rapid growth, solar generated 1.3% of global power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/renewable-energy/solar-energy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NesjavellirPowerPlant edit2.jpg|thumb|Steam rising from the [[Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station]] in Iceland]]

High Temperature Geothermal energy is from [[thermal energy]] generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the [[temperature]] of matter. Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from [[radioactive decay]] of minerals (in currently uncertain&lt;ref name=Dye&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dye | first1 = S.

The [[geothermal gradient]], which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of [[heat]] from the core to the surface. The adjective ''geothermal'' originates from the Greek roots ''geo'', meaning earth, and ''thermos'', meaning heat.

The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the Earth, all the way down to Earth's core&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|4,000|mi}} down. At the core, temperatures may reach over 9,000&amp;nbsp;°F (5,000&amp;nbsp;°C). Heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock. Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt, which is commonly known as magma. Magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock. This magma then heats rock and water in the crust, sometimes up to {{convert|700|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nemzer |first=J |title=Geothermal heating and cooling |url=http://www.geothermal.marin.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980111021839/http://geothermal.marin.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1998-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[hot spring]]s, geothermal energy has been used for bathing since [[Paleolithic]] times and for space heating since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for [[electricity generation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.fairfield.edu/mediacenter/nm_webdesign/s_zandan/sz_alt_energy/geothermal_energy.html|title=Project 2 template|website=faculty.fairfield.edu|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low Temperature Geothermal&lt;ref name="energy.gov"/&gt; refers to the use of the outer crust of the earth as a [[Thermal Battery]] to facilitate [[Renewable thermal energy]] for heating and cooling buildings, and other refrigeration and industrial uses.  In this form of Geothermal, a [[Geothermal heat pump|Geothermal Heat Pump]] and [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger]] are used together to move heat energy into the earth (for cooling) and out of the earth (for heating) on a varying seasonal basis.  Low temperature Geothermal (generally referred to as "GHP") is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements.  Thus Low Temperature Geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/|title=Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency® - DSIRE|website=DSIRE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward Net Zero Energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zero-energy building]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Net Zero Foundation"/&gt; In 2016, New York City passed a law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny-geo.org/blogs/a-word-from-us/81515204-new-york-city-council-gives-a-thumbs-up-to-geothermal-heat-pumps|title=New York City Gives a Thumbs Up to Geothermal Heat Pumps|website=ny-geo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring GHP anytime is shown to be economical with 20 year financing including the Socialized Cost of Carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/EPAactivities/economics/scc.html|title=Page being updated.|first=US|last=EPA, OEI|website=www3.epa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/right-price-for-carbon/|title=What Is the Right Price for Carbon?|first=Evan Lehmann,|last=Climatewire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomass is [[Biomaterial|biological material]] derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called [[lignocellulosic biomass]].&lt;ref name="Biomass Energy Center"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061008081905/http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=76,15049&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Biomass Energy Center].

Retrieved on 28 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of [[biofuel]]. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: ''thermal'', ''chemical'', and ''biochemical'' methods. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today;&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303740704577524822063133842|title=Log In|website=online.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples include forest residues – such as dead trees, branches and [[tree stump]]s –, yard clippings, wood chips and even [[municipal solid waste]].

Plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy. Some examples of these plants are wheat, which typically yield 7.5–8 tonnes of grain per hectare, and straw, which typically yield 3.5–5 tonnes per hectare in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy crops|url=http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=75,17301&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|work=crops are grown specifically for use as fuel|publisher=BIOMASS Energy Centre|accessdate=6 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310063405/http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=75,17301&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL#|archive-date=10 March 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity. Plant biomass can also be degraded from [[cellulose]] to [[glucose]] through a series of chemical treatments, and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first generation biofuel.

Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy such as [[methane]] gas or transportation fuels such as [[ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]]. Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all release methane gas{{spaced ndash}}also called [[landfill gas]] or [[biogas]]. Crops, such as corn and sugarcane, can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel, ethanol. Biodiesel, another transportation fuel, can be produced from left-over food products such as vegetable oils and animal fats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/sources/renewable/biomass.html Energy Kids].

With advanced technology being developed, cellulosic biomass, such as trees and grasses, are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Ethanol fuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. The energy costs for producing bio-ethanol are almost equal to, the energy yields from bio-ethanol. However, according to the [[European Environment Agency]], biofuels do not address global warming concerns.&lt;ref name=eea-biofuels&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/governance/scientific-committee/sc-opinions/opinions-on-scientific-issues/sc-opinion-on-greenhouse-gas |title=Opinion of the EEA Scientific Committee on Greenhouse Gas Accounting in Relation to Bioenergy |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiesel is made from [[vegetable oil]]s, [[animal fat]]s or recycled greases. It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

Biomass, biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment. Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrous oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and particulate matter (PM) are produced from the combustion of biomass; the World Health Organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/|title=WHO - 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomass combustion is a major contributor.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ |title=WHO - Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104165807/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ |archivedate=4 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|title=WHO - Household air pollution and health|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy storage===
{{main article|Energy storage|Grid energy storage}}
Energy storage is a collection of methods used to [[energy storage|store electrical energy]] on an [[grid (electricity)|electrical power grid]], or off it. Electrical energy is stored during times when production (especially from intermittent power plants such as renewable electricity sources such as [[wind power]], [[tidal power]], [[solar power]]) exceeds consumption, and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption. [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] is used for more than 90% of all grid power storage. Costs of lithium ion batteries are dropping rapidly, and are increasingly being deployed as fast acting sources of grid power (i.e. [[operating reserve]]) and for domestic storage.

From the end of 2004, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60% annually for many technologies. In 2015 global investment in renewables rose 5% to $285.9 billion, breaking the previous record of $278.5 billion in 2011. 2015 was also the first year that saw renewables, excluding large hydro, account for the majority of all new power capacity (134&amp;nbsp;GW, making up 53.6% of the total). Of the renewables total, wind accounted for 72&amp;nbsp;GW and solar photovoltaics 56&amp;nbsp;GW; both record-breaking numbers and sharply up from 2014 figures (49&amp;nbsp;GW and 45&amp;nbsp;GW respectively). In financial terms, solar made up 56% of total new investment and wind accounted for 38%.

Projections vary. The EIA has predicted that almost two thirds of net additions to power capacity will come from renewables by 2020 due to the combined policy benefits of local pollution, decarbonisation and energy diversification. Some studies have set out roadmaps to power 100% of the world’s energy with wind, hydroelectric and solar by the year 2030.

According to a 2011 projection by the International Energy Agency, solar power generators may produce most of the world's electricity within 50 years, reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment. Cedric Philibert, senior analyst in the renewable energy division at the IEA said: "Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world's demand for electricity by 2060{{spaced ndash}}and half of all energy needs{{spaced ndash}}with wind, hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation". "Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity", Philibert said.&lt;ref name="Ben Sills"/&gt;

In 2014 global [[wind power]] capacity expanded 16% to 369,553 MW.&lt;ref name="GWEG-2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GWEC_GlobalWindStats2014_FINAL_10.2.2015.pdf |title=GWEC Global Wind Statistics 2014 |date=10 February 2015 |format=PDF |publisher=GWEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yearly wind energy production is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4% of worldwide electricity usage,&lt;ref name=wwea2014&gt;{{cite book |author=The World Wind Energy Association |title=2014 Half-year Report |year=2014|pages=1–8 |publisher=WWEA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11.4% in the EU,&lt;ref name=EWEA2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/files/library/publications/statistics/EWEA-Annual-Statistics-2015.pdf|title=Wind in power: 2015 European statistics- EWEA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is widely used in [[Wind power in China|Asia]], and the [[Wind power in the United States|United States]].

As of 2018, American electric utility companies are planning new or extra renewable energy investments. These investments are particularly aimed at solar energy, thanks to the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] being signed into law. The law retained incentives for renewable energy development. Utility companies are taking advantage of the federal solar investment tax credit before it permanently goes down to 10% after 2021. According to the March 28 S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence report summary, "[[NextEra Energy]] Inc., [[Duke Energy]] Corp., and [[Dominion Energy]] Inc.’s utilities are among a number of companies in the sector contemplating significant solar investments in the near-term. Other companies, including [[Xcel Energy]] Inc. and [[Alliant Energy]] Corp., are undertaking large wind projects in the near-term, but are considering ramping up solar investments in the coming years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/policy/11736-steps-success-utilities-moving-community-solar-projects/|title=Steps to success for utilities moving into community solar projects|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2018-04-09|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper, through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition. A 2011 IEA report said: "A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support," and added that "cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue."&lt;ref name=henning&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-energy-iea-renewables-idUSTRE7AM0OV20111123 |title=Renewable energy becoming cost competitive, IEA says |author=Henning Gloystein |date=23 November 2011 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity. Renewable energy costs continue to drop, and the levelised cost of electricity ([[LCOE]]) is declining for wind power, solar photovoltaic ([[Photovoltaics|PV]]), concentrated solar power ([[Concentrated solar power|CSP]]) and some biomass technologies.&lt;ref name=irena111&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Overview_Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20Costs%20in%202012.pdf |title=Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2012: An Overview |author=International Renewable Energy Agency |year=2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where "oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today".&lt;ref name=irena111/&gt; A series of studies by the US [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] modeled the "grid in the Western US under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for 33 percent of the total power." In the models, inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of "between $0.47 and $1.28 to each MegaWatt hour generated"; however, the savings in the cost of the fuels saved "adds up to $7 billion, meaning the added costs are, at most, two percent of the savings."&lt;ref name=ArsTechnica&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===

Only a quarter of the worlds estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed, the regional potentials for the growth of hydropower around the world are, 71% Europe, 75% North America, 79% South America, 95% Africa, 95% Middle East, 82% Asia Pacific. However, the political realities of new reservoirs in western countries, economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas, result in the possibility of developing 25% of the remaining potential before 2050, with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/hydropower_essentials.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There is slow growth taking place in Western counties, but not in the conventional dam and reservoir style of the past. New projects take the form of [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]] and [[small hydro]], neither using large reservoirs. It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ntnu.no/documents/381182060/641036380/Leif+Lia_FINAL.PDF/32bac8f3-b443-493b-a1eb-e22ce572acd9&lt;/ref&gt; Where circumstances permit existing dams such as the [[Richard B. Russell Dam|Russell Dam built in 1985]] may be updated with "pump back" facilities for [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power. Countries with large hydroelectric developments such as Canada and [[Electricity sector in Norway#Export/Import|Norway are spending]] billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vpr.net/news_detail/88975/new-transmission-line-reaches-milestone/|title=New Transmission Line Reaches Milestone|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected [[solar PV systems]] has [[Growth of photovoltaics|grown into the millions]] and utility-scale [[Photovoltaic power station|solar power stations]] with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun.

Many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than fixed-mounted systems. There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations.

However, when it comes to renewable energy systems and PV, it is not just large systems that matter.

Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics, and affordable only in the affluent developed world. This erroneous view has persisted for many years, but 2015 was the first year when investment in non-hydro renewables, was higher in developing countries, with $156 billion invested, mainly in China, India, and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;FS-UNEP Collaborating Centre, [http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsinrenewableenergyinvestment2016lowres_0.pdf Global trends in renewable energy investment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114131550/http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsinrenewableenergyinvestment2016lowres_0.pdf# |date=14 November 2016 }}, 2016 p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.&lt;ref name=aus&gt;[http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf Power for the People] p. 3. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330120425/http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf |date=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/39544/?p1=MstCom |title=In the Developing World, Solar Is Cheaper than Fossil Fuels |author=Kevin Bullis |date=27 January 2012 |work=Technology Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems.&lt;ref name=re10&gt;REN21 (2010).

More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 1&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Carolyn. 28 June 2012. [http://cdkn.org/2012/06/interview-with-beth-barry-on-anguilla-renewable-energy/ Anguilla moves towards cleaner energy]&lt;/ref&gt;2 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. Some [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability.

Micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power. Over 44 million households use [[biogas]] made in household-scale digesters for [[lighting]] and/or [[cooking]], and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves.&lt;ref name="REN21 2011 14"/&gt; Clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world. Alcohol fuels (ethanol and methanol) can be produced sustainably from non-food sugary, starchy, and cellulostic feedstocks. Project Gaia, Inc. and CleanStar Mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectgaia.com/page.php?page=ethiopia |title=Ethiopia |publisher=Projectgaia.com |accessdate=1 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111225542/http://www.projectgaia.com/page.php?page=ethiopia |archivedate=11 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to [[poverty reduction]] by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting. Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals] pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] includes more than $70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs. Leading renewable energy companies include [[First Solar]], [[Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica|Gamesa]], [[GE Energy]], [[Hanwha Q Cells]], [[Sharp Solar]], [[Siemens]], [[SunOpta]], [[Suntech Power]], and [[Vestas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[REN21]] (2008). [http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/renewables2007.pdf Renewables 2007 Global Status Report (PDF)] p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many national, state, and local governments have also created [[Green bank (financial institution)|green banks]]. A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Berlin, Reed Hundt, Marko Muro, and Devashree Saha. “State Clean Energy Banks: New Investment Facilities for Clean Energy Deployment”&lt;/ref&gt; Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy.

The military has also focused on the use of [[renewable fuels]] for military vehicles. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable fuels can be produced in any country, creating a strategic advantage. The US military has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nextnavy.com/air-force-cedes-the-green-lead-and-the-lede-to-navy/ |title=Air Force cedes the Green lead–and the lede–to Navy |first=Craig |last=Hooper |work=nextnavy.com |year=2011 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] (IRENA) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide. It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate [[capacity building]] and technology transfer. IRENA was formed on 26 January 2009, by 75&amp;nbsp;countries signing the charter of IRENA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irena.org/downloads/Founconf/Signatory_States_20090126.pdf Signatory States] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226062317/http://irena.org/downloads/Founconf/Signatory_States_20090126.pdf |date=26 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2010, IRENA has 143&amp;nbsp;member states who all are considered as founding members, of which 14 have also ratified the statute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irena.org/downloads/Foundconf/Signatory_States_2010.pdf Signatories of IRENA's statute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124223255/http://irena.org/downloads/Foundconf/Signatory_States_2010.pdf |date=24 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, 119 countries have some form of national renewable energy policy target or renewable support policy. National targets now exist in at least 98 countries. There is also a wide range of policies at state/provincial and local levels.&lt;ref name=ren212011/&gt;

United Nations' Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity.&lt;ref name="renewableenergyworld1"/&gt; In October 2011, he "announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access, energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy. The group is to be co-chaired by Kandeh Yumkella, the chair of UN Energy and director general of the UN Industrial Development Organisation, and Charles Holliday, chairman of Bank of America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/nov/02/human-development-report-renewable-energy |title=UN calls for universal access to renewable energy |author=Mark Tran |date=2 November 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 100% renewable energy ===
{{Main article|100% renewable energy}}

The incentive to use 100% renewable energy, for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by [[global warming]] and other ecological as well as economic concerns. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. [[Renewable energy commercialization|Renewable energy use]] has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/100-percent-renewable-vision-building?amp;buffer_share=fdc06 |title=100 Percent Renewable Vision Building |author=Paul Gipe |date=4 April 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. Also, Professors S. Pacala and [[Robert H. Socolow]] have developed a series of "[[stabilization wedges]]" that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change, and "renewable energy sources," in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their "wedges".&lt;ref name=Pacala&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/mae/people/faculty/socolow/Science-2004-SW-1100103-PAPER-AND-SOM.pdf|title= Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies |author1=S. Pacala  |author2=R. Socolow  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2004|pages=968–972.|publisher=Science Vol. 305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using 100% renewable energy was first suggested in a [[Science (journal)|Science]] paper published in 1975 by Danish physicist [[Bent Sørensen (physicist)|Bent Sørensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sørensen | first1 = Bent | authorlink = Bent Sørensen (physicist) | year = 1975 | title = A plan is outlined according to which solar and wind energy would supply Denmark's needs by the year 2050 | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 189 | issue = 4199| pages = 255–260 | doi = 10.1126/science.189.4199.255 | pmid=17813696| bibcode = 1975Sci...189..255S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by several other proposals, until in 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published. These were followed by the first detailed 100% scenarios. In 2006 a PhD thesis was published by Czisch in which it was shown that in a 100% renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in Europe and North Africa. In the same year Danish Energy professor [[Henrik Lund (academic)|Henrik Lund]] published a first paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lund | first1 = Henrik | authorlink = Henrik Lund (academic) | year = 2006 | title = Large-scale integration of optimal combinations of PV, wind and wave power into the electricity supply | url = | journal = [[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 503–515 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2005.04.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables, which was followed by several other papers on the [[Energy transition|transition]] to 100% renewable energy in Denmark. Since then Lund has been publishing several papers on 100% renewable energy. After 2009 publications began to rise steeply, covering 100% scenarios for countries in Europe, America, Australia and other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hohmeyer | first1 = Olav | last2 = Bohm | first2 = Sönke | year = 2015 | title = Trends toward 100% renewable electricity supply in Germany and Europe: a paradigm shift in energy policies | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Energy and Environment | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 74–97 | doi = 10.1002/wene.128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, and Mark Delucchi published a study on 100% renewable global energy supply in the journal [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]. They found producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]], and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". They also found that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.&lt;ref name=enpol2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |author1=Mark A.

Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that "sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand."&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12619|title=Electricity from Renewable Resources: Status, Prospects, and Impediments |author=National Research Council| year=2010|pages=4|publisher=National Academies of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: [[climate change denial]], the [[fossil fuels lobby]], political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |title=Post Carbon Pathways |author=John Wiseman |date=April 2013 |work=University of Melbourne |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620031627/http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emerging technologies ==

Other renewable energy technologies are still under development, and include [[cellulosic ethanol]], [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[marine energy]].&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;International Energy Agency (2007).
[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2006/renewable_factsheet.pdf ''Renewables in global energy supply: An IEA facts sheet''] (PDF), OECD, p. 3. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012052513/http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2006/renewable_factsheet.pdf |date=12 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization. Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) funding.&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt;

There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum. Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Increasing the energy yield of generation from new and renewable energy sources | journal = Renewable energy | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | pages = 37–62 |author1=S.C.E.

Multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years. Two of the most prominent of these labs are [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL), both of which are funded by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and supported by various corporate partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/redmesa/|title=Defense-scale supercomputing comes to renewable energy research|accessdate=16 April 2012|publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandia has a total budget of $2.4 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/SNL%20Factsheet.pdf|title=Sandia National Laboratories|accessdate=16 April 2012|publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020170422/http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/SNL%20Factsheet.pdf|archive-date=20 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while NREL has a budget of $375 million.&lt;ref&gt;*Chakrabarty, Gargi, 16 April 2009.

* [[Enhanced geothermal system]]
[[File:EGS diagram.svg|thumb|upright|[[Enhanced geothermal system]] ''(see [[:File:EGS diagram.svg|file description]] for details)'']]

: Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are a new type of geothermal power technologies that do not require natural convective hydrothermal resources. The vast majority of geothermal energy within drilling reach is in dry and non-porous rock.&lt;ref name="Duchane"&gt;{{Cite news | last1 = Duchane | first1 = Dave | last2 = Brown | first2 = Don | date =December 2002 | title =Hot Dry Rock (HDR) Geothermal Energy Research and Development at Fenton Hill, New Mexico | periodical =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | publication-place =Klamath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =23 | issue =4 | pages = 13–19 | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/bulletin/bull23-4/art4.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =5 May 2009 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; EGS technologies "enhance" and/or create geothermal resources in this "hot dry rock (HDR)" through [[hydraulic fracturing|hydraulic stimulation]]. EGS and HDR technologies, such as hydrothermal geothermal, are expected to be baseload resources which produce power 24 hours a day like a fossil plant. Distinct from hydrothermal, HDR and EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world, depending on the economic limits of drill depth. Good locations are over deep [[granite]] covered by a thick (3–5&amp;nbsp;km) layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.science.org.au/sites/default/files/user-content/ausrenewableenergyfuture.pdf|title=Australia's Renewable Energy Future inc Cooper Basin &amp; geothermal map of Australia Retrieved 15 August 2015|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327104740/https://www.science.org.au/sites/default/files/user-content/ausrenewableenergyfuture.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are HDR and EGS systems currently being developed and tested in France, Australia, Japan, Germany, the U.S. and Switzerland. The largest EGS project in the world is a 25 megawatt demonstration plant currently being developed in the Cooper Basin, Australia. The Cooper Basin has the potential to generate 5,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;MW.
* [[Cellulosic ethanol]]
: Several refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethanol are built by companies such as [[Iogen Corporation|Iogen]], [[POET]], and [[Abengoa]], while other companies such as the [[Verenium Corporation]], [[Novozymes]], and Dyadic International&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dyadic.com/|title=Dyadic International - Bioenergy, Biopharmaceutical Enzymes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are producing enzymes which could enable future [[Cellulosic ethanol commercialization|commercialization]]. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.&lt;ref&gt;Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007). ''[[The Clean Tech Revolution]]'' p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marine energy]]
[[File:Rance tidal power plant.JPG|thumb|[[Rance Tidal Power Station]], France]]

: Marine energy (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy) refers to the energy carried by [[ocean wave]]s, [[tide]]s, [[salinity]], and [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|ocean temperature differences]]. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of [[kinetic energy]], or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries. The term marine energy encompasses both [[wave power]]{{spaced ndash}}power from surface waves, and [[tidal power]]{{spaced ndash}}obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. [[Reverse electrodialysis]] (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016 it is being tested at a small scale (50 kW). [[Offshore wind power]] is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the [[wind]], even if the [[wind turbine]]s are placed over water. The [[ocean]]s have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Carbon Trust, ''Future Marine Energy. Results of the Marine Energy Challenge: Cost competitiveness and growth of wave and tidal stream energy'', January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of land is more expensive, and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation. Unlike most land-based solar plants, floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view.

* [[Solar-assisted heat pump]]
:A [[heat pump]] is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a [[heat pump]] and [[Solar thermal collector|thermal solar panels]] in a single integrated system. Typically these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce [[Water heating|hot water]].&lt;ref name = ref1&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bine.info/en/publications/themeninfos/publikation/elektrisch-angetriebene-waermepumpen/waermepumpen-plus-solar/ | title = Solar-assisted heat pumps | language = en | access-date = 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.climatizzazioneconfontirinnovabili.enea.it/index.php/pompe-di-calore-elioassistite | title = Pompe di calore elio-assistite | language = it | access-date = 21 June 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120107065814/http://climatizzazioneconfontirinnovabili.enea.it/index.php/pompe-di-calore-elioassistite | archive-date = 7 January 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this system is to get high [[Coefficient of performance|COP]] and then produce energy in a more [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficient]] and less expensive way.

:It is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel (sheet and tubes, roll-bond, heat pipe, thermal plates) or [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector|hybrid]] ([[Mono-crystalline silicon|mono]]/[[Polycrystalline silicon|polycrystalline]], [[Thin-film solar cell|thin film]]) in combination with the heat pump. The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows covering a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the [[variable cost]]s of the system.
* [[Artificial photosynthesis]]
: Artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including [[nanotechnology]] to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol.&lt;ref&gt;Collings AF and Critchley C (eds). Artificial Photosynthesis{{spaced ndash}}From Basic Biology to Industrial Application (Wiley-VCH Weinheim 2005) p ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis which use a wider region of the solar spectrum, employ catalytic systems made from abundant, inexpensive materials that are robust, readily repaired, non-toxic, stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds, i.e., carbohydrates (rather than building and sustaining living cells).&lt;ref name=faunce&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/ee/c3ee00063j |title=Energy and environment policy case for a global project on artificial photosynthesis |journal= Energy &amp; Environmental Science |publisher=RSC Publishing |accessdate=19 August 2013|doi=10.1039/C3EE00063J |volume=6 |pages=695}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, prominent research faces hurdles, Sun Catalytix a MIT spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in 2012, because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=jobs |url=http://www.nature.com/news/artificial-leaf-faces-economic-hurdle-1.10703 |title='Artificial leaf' faces economic hurdle: Nature News &amp; Comment |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Algae fuels]]
: Producing liquid fuels from oil-rich varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic. Various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some system that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands.
* [[Solar aircraft]]
[[File:Solar Impulse SI2 pilote Bertrand Piccard Payerne November 2014.jpg|thumb|In 2016, ''[[Solar Impulse]] 2'' was the first [[solar-powered aircraft]] to complete a [[circumnavigation]] of the world.]]

:An [[electric aircraft]] is an aircraft that runs on [[electric motor]]s rather than [[internal combustion engine]]s, with electricity coming from [[fuel cell]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[ultracapacitors]], [[power beaming]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/Photo/Power-Beaming/index.html Power Beaming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217082723/http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/photo/Power-Beaming/index.html |date=17 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[electric battery|batteries]].

:Currently, flying manned electric aircraft are mostly experimental demonstrators, though many small [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s are powered by batteries. [[Model aircraft#Electric power|Electrically powered model aircraft]] have been flown since the 1970s, with one report in 1957.&lt;ref name="Noth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asl.ethz.ch/research/asl/skysailor/History_of_Solar_Flight.pdf|title=History of Solar Flight|last=Noth|first=André|date=July 2008|work=Autonomous Systems Lab|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology|page=3|accessdate=8 July 2010|location=Zürich|quote=Günter Rochelt was the designer and builder of Solair I, a 16 m wingspan solar airplane ... 21st of August 1983 he flew in Solair I, mostly on solar energy and also thermals, during 5 hours 41 minutes.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201032732/http://www.asl.ethz.ch/research/asl/skysailor/History_of_Solar_Flight.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/infographic-timeline-present-and-future-electric-flight|title=Infographic: A Timeline Of The Present And Future Of Electric Flight|author=|date=|work=Popular Science|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first man-carrying electrically powered flights were made in 1973.&lt;ref name=JAWA74&gt;{{cite book |title= Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1974-75|last= Taylor |first= John W R |edition= |year=1974|publisher=Jane's Yearbooks |location= London|isbn=0 354 00502 2|page=573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2015–2016, a manned, solar-powered plane, [[Solar Impulse 2]], completed a circumnavigation of the Earth.&lt;ref name=Batrawy&gt;{{cite web|author=Batrawy, Aya|date=9 March 2015|url=https://news.yahoo.com/solar-powered-plane-takes-off-flight-around-world-041503078.html| title=Solar-powered plane takes off for flight around the world|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Solar updraft tower]]
: The Solar updraft tower is a renewable-energy [[power plant]] for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall [[chimney]] tower. The resulting [[convection]] causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the [[chimney effect]]. This airflow drives [[wind turbine]]s placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce [[electricity]]. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.  A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the [[Vortex engine]] which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a [[vortex]] of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure.
* [[Space-based solar power]]
: For either photovoltaic or thermal systems, one option is to loft them into space, particularly Geosynchronous orbit.  To be competitive with Earth-based solar power systems, the specific mass (kg/kW) times the cost to loft mass plus the cost of the parts needs to be $2400 or less.  I.e., for a parts cost plus rectenna of $1100/kW, the product of the $/kg and kg/kW must be $1300/kW or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacejournal.ohio.edu/issue18/thermalpower.html|title=Online Journal of Space Communication|first=Online Journal of Space|last=Communication|website=spacejournal.ohio.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus for 6.5&amp;nbsp;kg/kW, the transport cost cannot exceed $200/kg.  While that will require a 100 to one reduction, SpaceX is targeting a ten to one reduction, Reaction Engines may make a 100 to one reduction possible.

== Debate ==
{{Main article|Renewable energy debate|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|Green job}}

Renewable electricity production, from sources such as wind power and solar power, is sometimes criticized for being variable or [[Intermittent power source|intermittent]], but is not true for concentrated solar, geothermal and biofuels, that have continuity. In any case, the [[International Energy Agency]] has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Energy Agency]] (2007). [http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security] IEA Information Paper, p. 5. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318231652/http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf |date=18 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been "not in my back yard" ([[NIMBY]]) concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some [[wind farm]]s, with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/080114-wind-energy.html |title=Whatever Happened to Wind Energy? |publisher=LiveScience |date=14 January 2008 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Massachusetts [[Cape Wind]] project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns. However, residents in other areas have been more positive. According to a town councilor, the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the [[Ardrossan Wind Farm]] in Scotland has enhanced the area.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|author=Simon Gourlay |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/windpower.alternativeenergy |title=Wind farms are not only beautiful, they're absolutely necessary |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=17 January 2012 |date=12 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent UK Government document states that "projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities. This means giving communities both a say and a stake".&lt;ref&gt;Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change (2011). [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48128/2167-uk-renewable-energy-roadmap.pdf UK Renewable Energy Roadmap (PDF)] p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In countries such as Germany and Denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities, particularly through [[cooperative]] structures, and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment.&lt;ref&gt;DTI, [http://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/36247mr_0_0.pdf Co-operative Energy: Lessons from Denmark and Sweden]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Report of a DTI Global Watch Mission, October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris C &amp; Pehnt M, [http://energytransition.de/wp-content/themes/boell/pdf/German-Energy-Transition.pdf German Energy Transition: Arguments for a Renewable Energy Future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403005225/http://energytransition.de/wp-content/themes/boell/pdf/German-Energy-Transition.pdf |date=3 April 2013 }}, Heinrich Böll Foundation, November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow. [[Climate change]] concerns and increasing in [[green job]]s, coupled with [[Oil price increases since 2003|high oil prices]], [[peak oil]], oil wars, [[oil spill]]s, promotion of [[electric vehicle]]s and renewable electricity, nuclear disasters and increasing government support, are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and [[renewable energy commercialization|commercialization]].&lt;ref name="UNEP" /&gt; New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors.&lt;ref name="obama"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spellman|first1=Frank R.|title=Safe Work Practices for Green Energy Jobs|date=2013|publisher=DEStech Publications|isbn=978-1-60595-075-4|pages=323|edition=first|url=http://www.destechpub.com/links/catalogs/bookstore/environmental-technology-6/safe-work-practices-for-green-energy-jobs/|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While renewables have been very successful in their ever-growing contribution to electrical power there are no countries dominated by fossil fuels who have a [[Fossil fuel phase-out|plan to stop]] and get that power from renwables. Only Scotland and Ontario have stopped burning coal, largely due to good natural gas supplies. In the area of transportation, fossil fuels are even more entrenched and solutions harder to find.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/media/training/presentations/Day_2_Renewables_5_Transport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It's unclear if there are failures with policy or renewable energy, but twenty years after the Kyoto Protocol  fossil fuels are still our primary energy source and consumption continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
{{Main|Renewable Heat Incentive scandal|Operation Car Wash|Biomass#Environmental damage}}
The ability of [[biomass]] and [[biofuels]] to contribute to a reduction in {{CO2}} emissions is limited because both biomass and biofuels emit large amounts of air pollution when burned and in some cases compete with food supply. Furthermore, biomass and biofuels consume large amounts of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12039&amp;page=45 |title =Water Issues of Biofuel Production Plants |author=The National Academies Press |year=2008|accessdate = 31 March 2017 |journal=The National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other renewable sources such as [[wind power]], [[photovoltaics]], and [[hydroelectricity]] have the advantage of being able to conserve water, lower pollution and reduce {{CO2}} emissions.

'''RiAFP''' refers to an [[antifreeze protein]] (AFP) produced by the ''[[Rhagium]] inquisitor'' longhorned beetle. It is a type V antifreeze protein with a molecular weight of 12.8 kDa; this type of AFP is noted for its hyperactivity.&lt;ref name="Graham1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graham LA, Liou YC, Walker VK, Davies PL | title = Hyperactive antifreeze protein from beetles | journal = Nature | volume = 388 | issue = 6644 | pages = 727–8 |date=August 1997 | pmid = 9285581 | doi = 10.1038/41908 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kristiansen2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kristiansen E, Ramløv H, Højrup P, Pedersen SA, Hagen L, Zachariassen KE | title = Structural characteristics of a novel antifreeze protein from the longhorn beetle ''Rhagium inquisitor''. | journal = Insect Biochem Molec. | volume = 41 | pages = 109–117 |date=February 2011 | pmid = 21078390 | doi = 10.1016/j.ibmb.2010.11.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kristiansen2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kristiansen E, Ramløv H, Hagen L, Pedersen SA, Andersen RA, Zachariassen KE | title = Isolation and characterization of hemolymph antifreeze proteins from larvae of the longhorn beetle ''Rhagium inquisitor'' | journal = Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol | volume = 142 | pages = 90–97 |date=September 2005 | pmid = 15993638 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpc.2005.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''R. inquisitor'' is a freeze-avoidant species, meaning that, due to its AFP, ''R. inquisitor'' prevents its body fluids from freezing altogether.&lt;ref name="Kristiansen2005" /&gt; This contrasts with freeze-tolerant species, whose AFPs simply depress levels of ice crystal formation in low temperatures. Whereas most insect antifreeze proteins contain [[cysteine]]s at least every sixth [[Amino acid|residue]], as well as varying numbers of 12- or 13-mer repeats of 8.3-12.5kDa,&lt;ref name="Duman2001"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Duman JG | title = Antifreeze and ice nucleator proteins in terrestrial arthropods | journal = Annu.

This property of RiAFP makes it particularly attractive for recombinant expression and biotechnological applications.

==AFPs==
AFPs work through an interaction with small ice crystals that is similar to an enzyme-ligand binding mechanism&lt;ref name="Graham1997" /&gt; which inhibits [[crystallization|recrystallization]] of ice. This explanation of the interruption of the ice crystal structure by the AFP has come to be known as the ''adsorption-inhibition hypothesis''.

According to this [[hypothesis]], AFPs disrupt the thermodynamically favourable growth of an ice crystal via kinetic inhibition of contact between solid ice and liquid water.&lt;ref name="Jorov2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jorov A, Zhorov BS, Yang DS | title = Theoretical study of interaction of winter flounder antifreeze protein with ice | journal = Protein Sci. | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 1524–37 |date=June 2004 | pmid = 15152087 | pmc = 2279984 | doi = 10.1110/ps.04641104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, the [[nucleation site]]s of the ice crystal lattice are blocked by the AFP, inhibiting the rapid growth of the crystal that could be fatal for the organism. In physical chemistry terms, the AFPs [[adsorbed]] onto the exposed ice crystal force the growth of the ice crystal in a convex fashion as the temperature drops,&lt;ref name="Kristiansen2011" /&gt; which elevates the ice vapour pressure at the nucleation sites. Ice vapour pressure continues to increase until it reaches equilibrium with the surrounding solution (water), at which point the growth of the ice crystal stops.

The aforementioned effect of AFPs on ice crystal nucleation is lost at the [[thermal hysteresis]] point. At a certain low temperature, the maximum convexity of the ice nucleation site is reached. Any further cooling will actually result in a "spreading" of the nucleation site away from this convex region, causing rapid, uncontrollable nucleation of the ice crystal.&lt;ref name="Kristiansen2011" /&gt; The temperature at which this phenomenon occurs is the thermal hysteresis point.&lt;br&gt;
The ''adsorption-inhibition hypothesis'' is further supported by the observation that antifreeze activity increases with increasing AFP concentration – the more AFPs adsorb onto the forming ice crystal, the more 'crowded' these proteins become, making ice crystal nucleation less favourable.

In the ''R. inquisitor'' beetle, AFPs are found in the [[haemolymph]], a fluid that bathes all the cells of the beetle and fills a cavity called the [[hemocoel|haemocoel]].&lt;ref name="Kristiansen2005" /&gt; The presence of AFPs in ''R. inquisitor'' allows the tissues and fluids within the beetle to withstand freezing up to -30&amp;nbsp;°C (the thermal hysteresis point for this AFP). This strategy provides an obvious survival benefit to these beetles, who are endemic to cold climates, such as [[Climate of the Nordic countries|Scandinavia]], [[Siberia#Climate|Siberia]], and [[Climate of Alaska|Alaska]].

==RiAFP Ice Binding==
[[File:RiAFP Internal Repeat Sequence Logo.jpeg|thumb|'''Figure 1:''' A sequence logo constructed from the 13-nucleotide repeat regions found by EBI-RADAR, showing a clear TxTxTxT binding motif embedded within these regions.]]
The primary structure of RiAFP (the sequence may be found [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/313766639 here]) determined by Mass Spectroscopy, Edman degradation and by constructing a partial cDNA sequence and PCR have shown that a TxTxTxT internal repeat exists &lt;ref name="Kristiansen2011" /&gt;. Sequence logos constructed from the RiAFP internal repeats, have been particularly helpful in the determination of the consensus sequence of these repeats. The TxTxTxT domains are irregularly spaced within the protein and have been shown to be conserved from the TxT binding motif of other AFPs.&lt;ref name="Kristiansen2011" /&gt; The [[hydroxyl]] [[Functional group|moiety]] of the [[Threonine|T]] residues fits well, when spaced as they are in the internal repeats, with the hydroxyl moieties of externally facing water molecules in the forming ice lattice. This mimics the formation of the growth cone at a nucleation site in the absence of AFPs. Thus, the binding of RiAFP inhibits the growth of the crystal in the basal and prism planes of the ice.&lt;ref name="Graether2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graether SP, Kuiper MJ, Gagnè SM, Walker VK, Jia Z, Sykes BD, Davies PL | title = β-helix structure and ice-binding properties of a hyperactive antifreeze protein from an insect | journal = Nature | volume = 406 | pages = 325–328 |date=July 2000 | pmid = 10917537 | doi = 10.1038/35018610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RiAFP Predicted Structure==
The fact that the binding motif appears as a "triplet" of the conserved TxT repeat, as well as the observation that [[BLAST|blastp]] queries have returned no viable matches, has led some researchers to suggest that RiAFP represents a new type of AFP – one that differs from the heavily studied ''TmAFP'' (from ''T. molitor''), ''DcAFP'' (from ''D. canadensis''), and ''CfAFP'' (from ''C. fumiferana'').&lt;ref name="Kristiansen2011" /&gt; On the basis of these observations, it has been predicted that the need for insect AFPs came about after insect evolutionary divergence, much like the evolution of fish AFPs; thus, different AFPs most likely evolved in parallel from adaptations to cold (environmental) stress.&lt;ref name="Lin2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin FH, Davies PL, Graham LA | title = The Thr- and Ala-Rich Hyperactive Antifreeze Protein from Inchworm Folds as a Flat Silk-like-β-Helix | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 21 |  pages = 4467–4478 |date=May 2011 | pmid =21486083 | doi = 10.1021/bi2003108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott1986"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scott GK, Fletcher GL, Davies PL | title = Fish Antifreeze Proteins: Recent Gene Evolution | journal = Can J Fish Aquat Sci | volume = 43 | issue = 5 |  pages = 1028–1034 | year = 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[homology modelling]] with ''TmAFP'', ''DcAFP'', or ''CfAFP'' would prove to be fruitless.

[[Protein structure prediction|Secondary structure modelling algorithms]] have determined that the internal repeats are spaced sufficiently to tend towards [[Beta strand|β-strand]] configuration; no [[Alpha helix|helical]] regions include the conserved repeats; and all [[Turn (biochemistry)|turn regions]] are located at the ends of β-strand regions.&lt;ref name="Kristiansen2011" /&gt; These data suggest that RiAFP is a well-folded [[Beta helix|β-helical]] protein, having six β-strand regions consisting of 13-amino acids (including one TxTxTxT binding motif) per strand.

An important issue for the [[aeronautics|aeronautical]] industry is the reduction of [[aircraft noise]]. The '''[[rotor (engine)|rotor]]–[[stator]] interaction''' is a predominant part of the noise emission.
We will present an introduction to these interaction theory, whose applications are numerous. For example, the conception of air-conditioning ventilators requires a full understanding of this interaction.

==Noise emission of a rotor–stator mechanism==
A rotor wake induces on the downstream stator blades a fluctuating vane loading, which is directly linked to the noise emission.

We consider a B blades rotor (at a rotation speed of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;) and a V blades stator, in a unique rotor–stator configuration. The source frequencies are multiples of &lt;math&gt;B \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, that is to say &lt;math&gt;mB \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For the moment we don’t have access to the source levels &lt;math&gt;F_{m}&lt;/math&gt;. The noise frequencies are also &lt;math&gt;mB \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, not depending on the number of blades of the stator. Nevertheless, this number V has a predominant role in the noise levels (&lt;math&gt;P_{m}&lt;/math&gt;) and directivity, as it will be discussed later.

''Example''

''For an airplane air-conditioning ventilator, reasonable data are :''

''&lt;math&gt;B=13&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega = 12000&lt;/math&gt; rnd/min''

''The blade passing frequency is 2600 Hz, so we only have to include the first two multiples (2600 Hz and 5200 Hz), because of the human ear high-sensibility limit. We have to study the frequencies m=1 and m=2.''

==Optimization of the number of blades==
As the source levels can't be easily modified, we have to focus on the interaction between those levels and the noise levels.

The transfer function &lt;math&gt;{{P_m } \over {F_m }}&lt;/math&gt; contains the following part :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\sum\limits_{s = - \infty }^{s = + \infty } {e^{ - {{i(mB - sV)\pi } \over 2}} J_{mB - sV} } (mBM)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where ''M'' is the [[Mach number]] and &lt;math&gt;J_{mB - sV}&lt;/math&gt; the [[Bessel function]] of ''mB''–''sV'' order. The influence of the transfer function may be minimized by reducing the value of the Bessel function.  To do so, the argument must be smaller than the order of the Bessel function.

''Back to the example :''

''For m=1, with a Mach number M=0.3, the argument of the Bessel function is about 4. We have to avoid having mB-sV less than 4. If V=10, we have 13-1x10=3, so there will be a noisy mode. If V=19, the minimum of mB-sV is 6, and the noise emission will be limited.''

''Remark :''

''The case that is to be strictly avoided is when mB-sV can be nul, which causes the order of the Bessel function to be 0. As a consequence, we have to take care having B and V prime numbers.''

==Determination of source levels==
The minimization of the transfer function &lt;math&gt;{{F_m } \over {P_m }}&lt;/math&gt; is a great step in the process of reducing the noise emission. Nevertheless, to be highly efficient, we also have to predict the source levels &lt;math&gt;F_{m}&lt;/math&gt;. This will lead us to choose to minimize the Bessel functions for the most significant values of m. For example, if the source level for m=1 is very higher than for m=2, we will not consider the Bessel functions of order 2B-sV.
The determination of the source levels is given by the Sears theory,which will not be explicated here.

==Directivity==
All this study was made for a privileged direction : the axis of the rotor–stator. All the results are acceptable when the noise reduction is ought to be in this direction. In the case where the noise to reduce is perpendicular to the axis, the results are very different, as those figures shown :

For B=13 and V=13, which is the worst case, we see that the sound level is very high on the axis (for &lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;) 

For B=13 and V=19, the sound level is very low on the axis but high perpendicularly to the axis (for &lt;math&gt;\theta = Pi/2&lt;/math&gt;)

'''The Royal Forestry Society''' ('''RFS''') is an educational charity and one of the oldest membership organisations in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] for those actively involved in [[woodland management]]. [[HM The Queen]] is the patron.

The RFS has a broad membership which includes [[woodland]] owners, managers, countryside professionals (land agents, ecologists, conservationists), academics, students and others with a general interest in woodland management. Membership is open to all.

== History ==

The Royal Forestry Society was established in 1882 in [[Northumberland]], [[England]].  Originally known as the English Arboricultural Society, the organisation was founded by [[forester]] Henry Clark and [[nursery (horticulture)|nurseryman]] John W Robson, both from [[Hexham]].

== Activities ==

The Society has 20 Divisions which between them organise up to 100 woodland field meetings a year on topics that span seed to sawmill. Annually: a top-level conference is held; there is a 4 or 5 day woodland study tour in England, Wales or Northern Ireland; Excellence in Forestry Awards take place, there is a travel bursary for forestry study abroad, and workshops, seminars and knowledge transfer events. Overseas study tours are held every other year.

The RFS helps shape formal forestry qualifications and its own Certificate of [[Arboriculture]] is recognised across the sector; it encourages students with a range of awards, bursaries and internships; has launched a research programme with colleges and has partnered with a number of organisations to help share knowledge.

The RFS Teaching Trees project is expanding, introducing primary schools and their pupils to their local woodlands and their benefits to the economy, environment and society.

The Society manages three woodlands, in the [[Chilterns]], part of the [[National Forest, England|National Forest]], and the largest and oldest grove of [[Coast Redwood|coast redwoods]] in Europe at [[Leighton Hall, Powys]] near [[Welshpool]]. These are managed as examples of good practice and lessons learned are shared with members.

The RFS maintains a library of forestry related books for members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6332">In [[mechanics]], two or more [[spring (device)|springs]] are said to be '''in series''' when they are connected end-to-end or point to point, and '''in parallel''' when they are connected side-by-side; in both cases, so as to act as a single spring.

More generally, two or more springs are ''in series'' when any external [[stress (physics)|stress]] applied to the ensemble gets applied to each spring without change of magnitude, and the amount strain (deformation) of the ensemble is the sum of the strains of the individual springs.  Conversely, they are said to be ''in parallel'' if the strain of the ensemble is their common strain, and the stress of the ensemble is the sum of their stresses.

Any combination of [[Hookean]] (linear-response) springs in series or parallel behaves like a single Hookean spring.  The formulas for combining their physical attributes are analogous to those that apply to [[capacitor]]s connected in [[series and parallel circuits|series or parallel]] in an [[electrical circuit]].

==Formulas==
===Equivalent spring===
The following table gives formulas for the spring that is equivalent to a system of two springs, in  series or in parallel, whose [[Hooke's law|spring constants]] are &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Symon (1971),  ''Mechanics.'' Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-07392-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The [[Stiffness#Compliance|compliance]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of a spring is the reciprocal &lt;math&gt;1/k&lt;/math&gt; of its spring constant.)

!Equivalent Spring Constant (Series)
|-
|When putting two springs in their equilibrium positions in series attached at the end to a block and then displacing it from that equilibrium, each of the springs will experience corresponding displacements ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a total displacement of ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. We will be looking for an equation for the force on the block that looks like:
::&lt;math&gt;F_b = -k_\mathrm{eq} (x_1+x_2) .\,&lt;/math&gt;

The force that each spring experiences will have to be same, otherwise the springs would buckle. Moreover, this force will be the same as ''F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''. This means that
::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = -k_1 x_1= F_2=-k_2 x_2 .\,&lt;/math&gt;

Working in terms of the absolute values, we can solve for &lt;math&gt;x_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2\,&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;x_1 ~=~ \frac{F_1}{k_1}\,,\qquad x_2 ~=~ \frac{F_2}{k_2}&lt;/math&gt;,
and similarly,
::&lt;math&gt;x_1 ~+~ x_2 ~=~ \frac{F_b}{k_\mathrm{eq}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Substituting &lt;math&gt;x_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2\,&lt;/math&gt; into the latter equation, we find
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{F_1}{k_1} ~+~ \frac{F_2}{k_2}  ~=~  \frac{F_b}{k_\mathrm{eq}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Now remembering that &lt;math&gt;F_1 ~=~ F_2 ~=~ F_b&lt;/math&gt;, we arrive at
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{k_\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="60%" style="text-align:left"
!Equivalent Spring Constant (Parallel)
|-
|Both springs are touching the block in this case, and whatever distance spring 1 is compressed has to be the same amount spring 2 is compressed.

The force on the block is then:
::{|
|&lt;math&gt;F_b \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= F_1 + F_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= -k_1 x - k_2 x \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}
So the force on the block is
::&lt;math&gt;F_b = - (k_1 + k_2) x. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Which is why we can define the equivalent spring constant as
::&lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{eq} = k_1 + k_2 .  \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="60%" style="text-align:left"
!Compressed Distance
|-
|In the case where two springs are in series,  the force of the springs on each other are equal:
::{|
|&lt;math&gt;F_1 = F_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;-k_1 x_1 = -k_2 x_2. \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

From this we get a relationship between the compressed distances for the '''in series''' case:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{x_1}{x_2} = \frac{k_2}{k_1}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="60%" style="text-align:left"
!Energy Stored
|-
|For the '''series''' case, the ratio of energy stored in springs is:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{E_1}{E_2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} k_1 x_1^2}{\frac{1}{2}k_2 x_2^2}, \,&lt;/math&gt;
but there is a relationship between x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; derived earlier, so we can plug that in:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{E_1}{E_2} = \frac{k_1}{k_2} \left(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\right)^2 = \frac{k_2}{k_1} . \,&lt;/math&gt;

For the '''parallel''' case,
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{E_1}{E_2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} k_1 x^2}{\frac{1}{2}k_2 x^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
because the compressed distance of the springs is the same, this simplifies to
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{E_1}{E_2} = \frac{k_1}{k_2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3981">'''Shock factor''' is a commonly used figure of merit for estimating the amount of shock experienced by a naval target from an [[underwater explosion]] as a function of  explosive charge weight, [[slant range]], and depression angle (between vessel and charge). &lt;ref name="formula_exp"&gt;{{cite book | first= A.H.| last= Keil|date=November 1961| title= The Response Of Ships To Underwater Explosion| publisher= Departmen Of The Navy| location= New York, N.Y. | accessdate=2018-07-07 | url= http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/268905.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;SF = {\frac{\sqrt W}{R}} {{(1+\sin \phi)} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

* ''R'' is the slant range in feet
* ''W'' is the equivalent [[TNT]] charge weight in pounds = charge weight (lbs) · [[Relative effectiveness|Relative effectiveness factor]]
* &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the depression angle between the hull and [[warhead]].

The application scenario for Equation 1 is illustrated by Figure 1.

The numeric result from computing the shock factor has no physical meaning, but it does provide a value that can be used to estimate the effect of an underwater blast on a vessel. Table 2 describes the effect of an explosion on a vessel for a range of shock factors.&lt;ref name="sf_exp"&gt;{{cite book | first= Terrence| last= Nawara|date=September 2003| title= Exploratory Analysis Of Submarine Tactics For Mine Detection And Avoidance| publisher= Naval Postgraduate School| location= Monterey, CA | accessdate=2006-06-10 | url= http://library.nps.navy.mil/uhtbin/hyperion/03sep%5FNawara.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The idea behind the shock factor is that an explosion close to a ship generates a shock wave that can impart sudden vertical motions to a ship's hull and internal systems. Many of the internal mechanical systems (e.g. engine coupling to prop) require precise alignment in order to operate. These vibrations upset these critical alignments and render these systems inoperative. The vibrations can also destroy lighting and electrical components, such as relays.

The explosion also generates a gas bubble that undergoes expansion and contraction cycles. These cycles can introduce violent vibrations into a hull, generating structural damage, even to the point of breaking the ship's [[keel]]. In fact, this is a goal of many undersea weapon systems.&lt;ref name = "MK48"&gt;{{cite web | title=MK 48 Torpedo Firing| work=Jane's Information Group| url=http://www.janes.com/defence/naval_forces/gallery/slideshow_010202.shtml| accessdate=2006-06-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060427035918/http://www.janes.com/defence/naval_forces/gallery/slideshow_010202.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnitude of an explosion's effects have been shown through empirical and theoretical analyses to be related to the size of the explosive charge, the distance of the charge from the target, and the angular relationship of the hull to the shock wave.&lt;ref name="wep_eff"&gt;{{cite book| editor=Naval Sea Systems Command|title= Introduction to Weapon Effects for Ships (Metric)| url= http://www.combatindex.com/mil_docs/pdf/hdbk/0200/MIL-HDBK-297.pdf| accessdate=2006-06-10 | publisher= US Department of Defense| location= Washington, DC| id= MIL-HDBK-297(SH)|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''K-219''''' was a Project 667A [[Yankee-class submarine|''Navaga''-class ballistic missile submarine]] ([[NATO reporting name]] Yankee I) of the [[Soviet Navy]]. It carried 16 (later 15) [[R-27 (missile)|SS-N-6]] liquid-fuel missiles powered by [[Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine|UDMH]] with [[Red fuming nitric acid|IRFNA]], equipped with an estimated 34 nuclear warheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramana|Reddy|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=73_zmsMEpLcC&amp;pg=RA1-PA130&amp;lpg=PA131#PRA1-PA131,M1 131]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''K-219'' was involved in what has become one of the most controversial submarine incidents during the [[Cold War]].

==The incident==

===Preamble===
On Friday 3 October 1986, while on an otherwise routine [[Cold War]] nuclear deterrence patrol in the North Atlantic {{convert|680|mi|km|order=flip}} northeast of [[Bermuda]], the 15-year-old ''K-219'' suffered an explosion and fire in a missile tube. The seal in a missile hatch cover failed, allowing saltwater to leak into the missile tube and react with residue from the missile's liquid fuel. Though there was no official announcement, a published source (citing no sources) said the Soviet Union claimed that the leak was caused by a collision with the [[submarine]] {{USS|Augusta|SSN-710|6}}. ''Augusta'' was certainly operating in proximity, but both the [[United States Navy]]&lt;ref name=soundings&gt;{{Harvnb|Irza|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the commander of ''K-219'', Captain Second Rank [[Igor Britanov]], deny that a collision took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_28/yankee.html|title=Loss of a Yankee SSBN|journal=Undersea Warfare|volume=7|issue=5|date=Fall 2005|author1=Captain 1st Rank (Ret.) Igor Kurdin, Russian Navy|author2=Lt. Cmdr. Wayne Grasdock, USN|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723022550/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_28/yankee.html|archivedate=23 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''K-219'' had previously experienced a similar casualty; one of her missile tubes was already disabled and welded shut, having been permanently sealed after an explosion caused by reaction between seawater leaking into the silo and missile fuel residue. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huchthausen |first=Peter |last2=Kurdin |first2=Igor |last3=White |first3=Allen |date=1997 |title=Hostile Waters |publisher=St. Martin's Press |page=24 |isbn=0312966121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:K-219 map.PNG|thumb|left|250|Location of the incident]]
The authors of the book [[Hostile Waters (book)|''Hostile Waters'']] reconstructed the incident from descriptions by the survivors, ships' logs, the official investigations, and participants both ashore and afloat from the Soviet and the American sides. The result was a novelized version of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huchthausen |last2=Kurdin |last3=White |title=Hostile Waters |page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Event===
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--3 paragraphs without references--&gt;
Shortly after 0530 Moscow time, seawater leaking into silo six of ''K-219'' reacted with missile fuel, producing chlorine and nitrogen dioxide gases and sufficient heat to explosively decompose additional fuming nitric acid to produce more nitrogen dioxide gas. ''K-219'' weapons officer Alexander Petrachkov attempted to cope with this by disengaging the hatch cover and venting the missile tube to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huchthausen |last2=Kurdin |last3=White |title=Hostile Waters |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after 0532, an explosion occurred in silo six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huchthausen |last2=Kurdin |last3=White |title=Hostile Waters |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''Undersea warfare'' by Captain First Rank (Ret.) Igor Kurdin, Russian Navy – ''K-219''{{'}}s previous XO ([[executive officer]]) – and Lieutenant Commander Wayne Grasdock, USN described the explosion occurrence as follows:
{{quote|At 0514, the BCh-2 officer and the hold machinist/engineer in compartment IV (the forward missile compartment) discovered water dripping from under the plug of missile tube No. 6 (the third tube from the bow on the port side). During precompression of the plug, the drips turned into a stream. The BCh-2 officer reported water in missile tube No. 6, and at 0525, the captain ordered an ascent to a safe depth (46 meters) while a pump was started in an attempt to dry out missile tube No. 6. At 0532, brown clouds of oxidant began issuing from under the missile-tube plug, and the BCh-2 officer declared an accident alert in the compartment and reported the situation to the GKP (main control post). Although personnel assigned to other compartments left the space, nine people remained in compartment IV. The captain declared an accident alert. It took the crew no more than one minute to carry out initial damage control measures, which included hermetically sealing all compartments. Five minutes later, at 0538, an explosion occurred in missile tube No. 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurdin|Grasdock|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Two sailors were killed outright in the explosion, and a third died soon afterward from toxic gas poisoning. Through a breach in the hull, the vessel immediately started taking on sea water, quickly sinking from its original depth of {{convert|40|m}} to eventually reach a depth in excess of {{convert|300|m}}. Sealing of all of the compartments and full engagement of the sea water pumps in the stricken compartments enabled the depth to be stabilised.

25 sailors were trapped in a sealed section, and it was only after a conference with his incident specialists that the Captain allowed the Chief Engineer to open the hatch and save the 25 lives. It could be seen from instruments that although the nuclear reactor should have automatically shut down, it was not. Lt. Nikolai Belikov, one of the reactor control officers, entered the reactor compartment but ran out of oxygen after turning just one of the four rod assemblies on the first reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1998/feb/07/soviet-submariner-gave-his-life-for-peace/|title=Soviet Submariner Gave His Life For Peace  Officers Nominate Seaman For U.S. Heroism Medal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty-year-old enlisted seaman [[Sergei Preminin]] then volunteered to shut down the reactor, to be enabled by operating under instruction from the Chief Engineer. Working with a full-face gas mask, he successfully shut down the reactor. A large fire had developed within the compartment, raising the pressure. When Preminin tried to reach his comrades on the other side of a door, the pressure difference prevented him from opening it, and he subsequently died of [[asphyxiation]] in the reactor compartment.

In a nuclear safe condition, and with sufficient stability to allow it to surface, Captain Britanov surfaced ''K-219'' on battery power alone. He was then ordered to have the ship towed by a Soviet freighter back to her home port of [[Gadzhiyevo]], {{convert|7000|km|mi}} away. Although a towline was attached, towing attempts were unsuccessful, and after subsequent poison gas leaks into the final aft compartments and against orders, Britanov ordered the crew to evacuate onto the towing ship, but remained aboard ''K-219'' himself.

Displeased with Britanov's inability to repair his submarine and continue his patrol, Moscow ordered Valery Pshenichny, ''K-219''’s security officer, to assume command, transfer the surviving crew back to the submarine, and return to duty. Before those orders could be carried out the flooding reached a point beyond recovery and on 6 October 1986 the ''K-219'' sank to the bottom of the Hatteras [[Abyssal plain|Abyssal Plain]]&lt;ref name=Offley2007p112 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061006/NEWS/110060129&amp;SearchID=73259541411267]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205050321/http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20061006%2FNEWS%2F110060129&amp;SearchID=73259541411267 |date=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at a depth of about 6,000 m (18,000&amp;nbsp;ft).  Britanov abandoned ship shortly before the sinking.  ''K-219'''s full complement of nuclear weapons was lost along with the vessel.

=== Aftermath ===
In 1988, the Soviet hydrographic research ship ''[[Akademik Mstislav Keldysh|Keldysh]]'' positioned itself over the wreck of ''K-219'', and found the submarine sitting upright on the sandy bottom.  It had broken in two, aft of the conning tower.  Several missile silo hatches had been forced open, and the missiles, along with the nuclear warheads they contained, were gone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huchthausen |last2=Kurdin |last3=White |title=Hostile Waters |page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preminin was posthumously awarded the [[Order of the Red Star]] for his bravery in securing the reactors.&lt;ref name=Offley2007p112&gt;{{Harvnb|Offley|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KEeprDKp8wIC&amp;pg=PA112 112]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britanov was charged with negligence, sabotage, and treason. He was never imprisoned, but waited for his trial in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]]. On 30 May 1987, Defense Minister [[Sergey Leonidovich Sokolov|Sergey Sokolov]] was dismissed as a result of the [[Mathias Rust]] incident two days earlier, and replaced by [[Dmitry Yazov]]; the charges against Britanov were subsequently dismissed.

==''Hostile Waters'' film==
In 1997, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[BBC]] television film ''[[Hostile Waters (film)|Hostile Waters]]'', co-produced with [[HBO]] and starring [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Martin Sheen]], and [[Max von Sydow]], was released in the United States by [[Warner Bros.]] It was based on the book by the same name, which claimed to describe the loss of ''K-219''. In 2001, Captain Britanov filed suit, claiming Warner Bros. did not seek or get his permission to use his story or his character, and that the film did not portray the events accurately and made him look incompetent. After three years of hearing, the court ruled in Britanov's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irza |first1=John |year=2004 |title=Soundings |publisher=IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society |volume=XXXVIII |number=4 |url=http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/newsletters/oes/html/fall04/soundings.html |accessdate=29 November 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216052722/http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/newsletters/oes/html/fall04/soundings.html |archivedate=16 December 2004 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Russian media reported that the filmmaker paid a settlement totaling under $100,000.

After the release of the movie, The U.S. Navy issued the following statement regarding both the book and the movie:

{{quote|The United States Navy normally does not comment on submarine operations, but in {{sic|the|expected=this}} case, because the scenario is so outrageous, the Navy is compelled to respond. The United States Navy categorically denies that any U.S. submarine collided with the Soviet Yankee Class submarine K-219 or that the Navy had anything to do with the cause of the casualty that resulted in the loss of the Soviet [[Yankee-class submarine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.navy.mil/navydata/navy_legacy_hr.asp?id=171 |title= U. S. Navy: Hostile Waters |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An article on the U.S. Navy's website posted by Captain 1st Rank (Ret.) Igor Kurdin (former XO of ''K-219'') and Lieutenant Commander Wayne Grasdock denied any collision between ''K-219'' and ''Augusta''. Captain Britanov also denies a collision, and he has stated that he was not asked to be a guest speaker at Russian functions, because he refuses to follow the Russian government's interpretation of the ''K-219'' incident.&lt;ref&gt;Kurdin, Igor; Grasdock, Wayne (Fall 2005), "Loss of a Yankee SSBN", Undersea Warfare 2005 Vol. 7, No. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In a BBC interview recorded in February 2013, Admiral of the Fleet [[Vladimir Chernavin]], the C-in-C of the Soviet Navy at the time of the ''K-219'' incident, says the accident was caused by a malfunction in a missile tube, and makes no mention of a collision with an American submarine.  The interview was conducted for the BBC2 series ''The Silent War''.

'''Spotted Lake''' is a [[Saline water|saline]] [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] [[Soda lake|alkali lake]] located northwest of [[Osoyoos]] in the eastern [[Similkameen Valley]] of [[British Columbia]], Canada, accessed via [[Crowsnest Highway|Highway 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{BCGNIS|16532|Spotted Lake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mineral and salt concentration ==

Spotted Lake is richly concentrated with various [[minerals]]. It contains dense deposits of [[magnesium sulfate]], [[calcium]] and [[sodium sulfate|sodium sulphates]]. It also contains high concentrations of eight other minerals and lower amounts of [[silver]] and [[titanium]].&lt;ref name="OGS_Spotted_Lake"&gt;

Most of the water in the lake evaporates over the summer, revealing colorful mineral deposits. Large “spots” on the lake appear and are colored according to the mineral composition and seasonal amount of [[precipitation]].&lt;ref name="OGS_Spotted_Lake"/&gt; Magnesium sulfate, which crystallizes in the summer, is a major contributor to spot color. In the summer, remaining minerals in the lake harden to form natural “walkways” around and between the spots.

== Naming and history ==
[[File:Spotted Lake close-up.jpg|thumb|left|View from highway 3]]

Originally known to the [[First Nations]] of the [[Okanagan Valley]] as ''Kliluk'', Spotted Lake was for centuries and remains revered as a sacred site thought to provide [[Hydrotherapy|therapeutic waters]].&lt;ref name="OGS_Spotted_Lake"/&gt; During [[World War I]], the minerals of Spotted Lake were used in manufacturing [[ammunition]].

Later, the area came under the control of the Ernest Smith Family for a term of about 40&amp;nbsp;years. In 1979, Smith attempted to create interest in a spa at the lake. The First Nations responded with an effort to buy the lake, then in October 2001, struck a deal by purchasing 22&amp;nbsp;hectares of land for a total of $720,000, and contributed about 20% of the cost. The [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Indian Affairs Department]] paid the remainder.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Spotted Lake today ==
[[File:Gateway to Ktlil'x (Spotted Lake) a medicine lake for the Okanagan people.JPG|thumb|Gateway to Ktlil'x (Spotted Lake), a traditional medicine lake for the Syilx people]]
Today, there is a roadside sign telling visitors that the lake is a cultural and ecologically sensitive area, and a [[traditional medicine]] lake for the [[Syilx|Okanagan Syilx]] people. The lake can be viewed from the fence that has been erected for protection from the liabilities of public access. Many travelers stop to view the site.

'''Sputnik 1 EMC/EMI''' is a class of full-scale [[test article|laboratory models]] of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Sputnik 1]] satellite, made to test ground [[Electromagnetic compatibility|Electromagnetic Compatibility]] (EMC) and [[Electromagnetic interference|Electromagnetic Interference]] (AMI). The models, manufactured by [[S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|OKB-1]] and NII-885 (headed by Mikhail Ryazansky), were introduced on February 15, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik_preflight.html|title=Preparations for Sputnik launch|website=www.russianspaceweb.com|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2016, a working Sputnik-1 EMC/EMI model, serial number 003, was sold at [[Bonhams]] in New York for [[United States dollar|US$]]269,000. It featured a still-operational transmitter and four antennas.

Australian '''Stanley Keith Pearl''' was a [[sapper]] with the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I]]. His exact dates of birth and death are unclear. After enlisting at the town of [[Ulverstone]] in [[Tasmania]] on 9 November 1915 at twenty-one years of age, Pearl, in August 1916, became a sapper with the Australian 5 Field Company Engineers.&lt;ref name=Saunders2016&gt;Nicholas J. Saunders, "Sapper Stanley Keith Pearl," in ''Sappers &amp; Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches'', Lisa Slade (Adelaide: Art Gallery of South Australia, 2016), 15. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Embarkation&gt;Australian War Memorial, [https://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1778164/ "First World War Embarkation Rolls: Stanley Keith Pearl"], ''[[Australian War Memorial]]'', n.d., accessed 5 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slade2015&gt;Lisa Slade, "Trench Art: Sappers and Shrapnel – on Trench Art and Material Culture in Contemporary Art," ''Art &amp; War: Badlands'', in ''Artlink'' 35, no. 1 (March 2015), n.p. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016&gt;Kerry Neale, [https://www.awm.gov.au/blog/2016/04/28/decoration-destruction-first-world-war-trench-art-sapper-pearl/ "Decoration from Destruction: the First World War Trench Art of Sapper Pearl"], ''[[Australian War Memorial]]'', 28 April 2016, accessed 5 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He performed this role for the duration of the war.&lt;ref name=Saunders2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slade2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; Many details on Pearl himself remain a mystery. A consideration of the phenomenal [[trench art]] collection that he produced, however, helps to piece together essential information about him.

== World War I ==

Pearl was a [[joiner]] by trade whose father was Charles Pearl of Ulverstone, Tasmania.&lt;ref name=Embarkation /&gt; Pearl was Anglican.&lt;ref name=Embarkation /&gt; He embarked from Sydney to Alexandria and then the [[Western Front (World War I)]] in France aboard HMAT ''Orsova'' on 11 March 1916.&lt;ref name=Saunders2016 /&gt; He undertook a brief stint with the 8 Field Company Engineers (Reinforcement 4) before joining the 5 Field Company Engineers.&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Australian Imperial Force (AIF) Project, [https://www.aif.adfa.edu.au/showPerson?pid=237003 "Stanley Keith Pearl"], (n.d.) ''[[University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra, Australian Defence Force Academy]]'', accessed 29 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl’s [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)]] and [[British War Medal]] are held in the Australian War Memorial’s collection.&lt;ref&gt;Australian War Memorial collection, [https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/REL/21088.002 "Victory Medal: Sapper S K Pearl, 5 Field Company Engineers, AIF"], accessed 29 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Australian War Memorial collection, [https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/REL/21088.001 "British War Medal 1914-20: Sapper S K Pearl, 5 Field Company Engineers, AIF"], accessed 29 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearl produced a phenomenal collection of trench art between 1916 and 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl donated his trench art objects to the [[Australian War Memorial]] but whether this reflects the full extent of that which he produced in the context of war remains a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; A total of fifteen of Pearl’s [[Work of art|oeuvre]] are held in the Australian War Memorial’s Military Heraldry collection.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AWMConline&gt;Australian War Memorial collection, [https://www.awm.gov.au/search/all/?query=sapper+stanley+keith+pearl&amp;submit=&amp;op=Search&amp;format=list&amp;section%5B0%5D=collections "Collections search: Sapper Stanley Keith Pearl"], accessed 4 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Military shell cases, other parts of shells, badges and buttons were just some of the war-related materials used by Pearl to assemble everyday objects such as a clock, a map of Tasmania and a hat pin stand, as is evidenced by the accessibility and digitisation of his work on the War Memorial’s online collection (see external links for selection of images).&lt;ref name=AWMConline /&gt; One can become more familiar with Pearl’s work through such a collection as it displays images of the objects together with Pearl’s own field notes. The accompanying field notes that Pearl documented alongside each piece are fascinating as this was not a feature typically associated with First World War trench art.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl used matter-of-fact language where tales of death became mere descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.22, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl’s field notes and his details on the First World War embarkation roll are useful additional [[primary source]]s for [[historian]]s, [[art historian]]s and [[anthropologist]]s.

==Post-war and legacy==

There is no evidence to suggest that Pearl is survived by anyone, nor have any photographs of him been discovered.&lt;ref name=Mitzevich2016&gt; Nick Mitzevich, "Director’s Foreword," in ''Sappers &amp; Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches'', Lisa Slade (Adelaide: Art Gallery of South Australia, 2016), 8. &lt;/ref&gt; He is an "enigma." &lt;ref name=Mitzevich2016 /&gt; It is therefore Pearl’s material existence in the form of trench art that survives, the power of which is subsequently elevated. The creative and artistic vision of Pearl to contribute to the [[material culture]] of World War I, of which trench art is a fascinating example, has meant that his name lives on through these well-crafted, striking objects.&lt;ref name=Saunders2000&gt;Nicholas J. Saunders, "Bodies of Metal, Shells of Memory: ‘Trench Art’, and the Great War Re-cycled," ''Journal of Material Culture'' 5, no. 1 (2000), 45. &lt;/ref&gt; Pearl was unconsciously engaging with features of material culture such as [[bricolage]] and recyclia in producing trench art.&lt;ref&gt; Corinne A. Kratz, "Rethinking Recyclia," ''African Arts'' 28, no. 3 (Summer 1995), 7, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2000, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that he was a joiner pre-war also speaks to this refined, craftsmanship-like quality to his pieces.

Pearl survived World War I. During March of 1919, Pearl returned to Tasmania, although soon relocated to Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; He began working for the Australian War Memorial in 1941, the year that it opened, and continued to do so until he retired.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; He worked as a carpenter and senior tradesman at the War Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; The electoral roll details Pearl’s exact position at the War Memorial as an ‘installation manager.’&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; Such hands-on employment echoes his pre-war occupation as a joiner.

A recent exhibition entitled ''Sappers &amp; Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches'' at the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]] showcased Pearl’s trench art. The exhibition presented Pearl’s pieces alongside other First World War trench art objects and more recent works of art that reflected on war today. Such a display, in bringing together the historical and the contemporary, was the first opportunity whereby the trench art of Pearl was exposed to a wider audience.&lt;ref name=Mitzevich2016 /&gt; It is evidence that Pearl and his trench art collection hold an important relevance today and will continue to do so in the future, especially in studies of [[history]], [[art history]] and [[anthropology]].

'''Stiegler's Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station''' ('''SGHPS'''), is a planned {{convert|2100|MW}} [[hydroelectric dam]] in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name="One"&gt;{{cite web|first=Shem | url=https://www.enr.com/articles/42607-tanzania-revives-2100-mw-hydro-power-project |title=Tanzania Revives 2,100-MW Hydro Power Project |publisher=Engineering News Record (ENR) |date=18 August 2017 |access-date=3 April 2018 |last=Oirere}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power station is expected to produce 5,920GWh of power annually.&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=4 April 2018 |last=Mirondo |url=http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/Tanzania-opens-bids-for-construction-of-Stiegler-s/1840340-4077020-4qow63/index.html | title=Tanzania Opens Bids for Construction of Stiegler's Gorge Project |date=30 August 2017 |first=Rosemary |newspaper=[[The Citizen (Tanzania)]] |location=Dar es Slaam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The power station would be located across the [[Rufiji River]], in the ''Stiegler's Gorge'', in the [[Selous Game Reserve]], [[Morogoro Region]], approximately {{convert|220|km|0}}, by road, southwest of [[Dar es Salaam]], the commercial capital and largest city of Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=3 April 2018 | url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Tanzania_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Dar%20es%20Salaam%2C%20Tanzania&amp;toplace=Stiegler%27s%20Gorge%2C%20Tanzania&amp;dt1=ChIJ8dabFq5LXBgR3aGGoCZrD5Q&amp;dt2=ChIJf7TUhESsWRgRW2Kd2-0VKZc |title=Distance between Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Stiegler's Gorge, Tanzania |access-date=3 April 2018 | publisher=Globefeed.com |author=Globefeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This power station is located in Selous Game Reserve, one of the world's largest [[World Heritage]] sites, measuring {{convert|45000|km2|mi2}}. The power station and reservoir lake are planned to occupy approximately {{convert|1350|km2|mi2}}, within the game reserve.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

==Overview==
The government of Tanzania has been considering establishing this power station since the 1960s. When fully developed, it will be the largest power station in Tanzania. The {{convert|134|m|ft}} arched, concrete dam is expected to create a reservoir lake, {{convert|100|km|mi}}, in length, measuring {{convert|1200|km2|mi2}}, with {{convert|34000000000|m3|ft3}} of water.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

==Construction==
In August 2017, the Tanzanian government advertised for bids to construct this dam. The selected  contractor is expected to complete the dam in no more than 36 months.&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tanzania-power/tanzania-invites-bids-for-hydropower-project-in-game-reserve-idUSKCN1BB1G5 |title=Tanzania invites bids for hydropower project in game reserve |access-date=4 April 2018 |first=Fumbuka |date=31 August 2017 | publisher=[[Reuters.com]] | last=Ng'wanakilala}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/26/tanzania-presses-on-hydroelectric-dam-vast-game-reserve |title=Tanzania presses on with hydroelectric dam on vast game reserve  |

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4286">[[Image:Sulfonium ion.png|thumb|Sulfonium ion]]
A '''sulfonium ion''', also known as '''sulphonium ion''' or '''sulfanium ion''', is a positively charged [[ion]] (a "[[cation]]") featuring three organic [[Substitution (chemistry)|substituents]] attached to sulfur.  These [[organosulfur compound]]s have the formula [SR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Together with a negatively charged counterion, they give '''sulfonium salts'''.  They are typically colorless solids that are soluble in organic solvent.

==Synthesis==
Sulfonium compounds are usually [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] by the reaction of [[thioether]]s with [[alkyl halide]]s. For example, the reaction of [[dimethyl sulfide]] with [[iodomethane]] yields [[trimethylsulfonium iodide]]:
: {{chem|CH|3|–S–CH|3}} + {{chem|CH|3|–I}} → {{chem|(CH|3|)|3|S|+}} + {{chem|I|-}}

Before the above reaction, the sulfur atom has two lone electron pairs.  One of these lone pairs links to the methyl group.  At the same time, as part of a concerted nucleophilic substitution mechanism (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2), the iodide leaving group departs. This leaves a positively charged trimethylsulfonium ion, whose charge is balanced by the iodide. The rate of reaction is even faster with stronger methylating agents, such as [[methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate]].

==Structure==
The compounds are pyramidal at sulfur.  Thus, Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is isostructural and isoelectronic to [[trimethylphosphine]].  Sulfonium compounds wherein the three substituents differ are chiral and optically stable.&lt;ref&gt;March, J. “Advanced Organic Chemistry” 5th Ed.  J. Wiley and Sons, 1992: New York.  {{ISBN|0-471-60180-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications and occurrence==

===Biochemistry===
The sulfonium (more specifically [[Methionine|methioninium]]) species [[S-Adenosylmethionine|''S''-adenosylmethionine]] occurs widely in nature, where it is used as a source of the adenosoyl radical.  This radical participates in the [[biosynthesis]] of various compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Layer, G.; Heinz, D. W.; Jahn, D.; Schubert, W.-D. "Structure and function of radical SAM enzymes" Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2004, volume 8, 468-476. {{DOI|10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry A. Frey, Olafur Th. Magnusson "S-Adenosylmethionine:  A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, or a Rich Man's Adenosylcobalamin?" Chem. Rev., 2003, 103 (6), pp 2129–2148. {{DOI|10.1021/cr020422m}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:S-Adenosyl-L-methionin.svg|thumb|right|200px|Structure of [[S-Adenosylmethionine|''S''-adenosylmethionine]].]]
Another, sulfonium ([[Methionine|methioninium]]) species found in nature is [[S-Methylmethionine|''S''-methylmethionine]].

===Organic synthesis===
Sulfonium salts are precursor to sulfur [[ylide]]s, which are useful in C-C forming reactions. In a typical application, a R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R′ center is deprotonated to give the ylide R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CHR&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Mitchell J. Bogdanowicz, Barry M. Trost | title = Cyclopropylphenylsulfonium Tetrafluoroborate | collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 364 | prep = cv6p0364  | year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TASF.png|thumb|right|220px|Structure of [[TASF reagent|tris(dimethylamino)sulfonium difluorotrimethylsilicate]].]]

[[TASF reagent|Tris(dimethylamino)sulfonium difluorotrimethylsilicate]] [((CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is a popular fluoridation agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = W. J. Middleton | title = Tris(dimethylamino)sulfonium difluorotrimethylsilicate | collvol = 7 | collvolpages = 528 | year = 1990 | prep = cv7p0528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some azo dyes are modified with sulfonium groups to give them a positive charge.  The compound [[triphenylsulfonium triflate]] is a photoacid, a compound that under light converts to an acid.

[[File:Kluft-photo-Tehachapi-Wind-Farm-Feb-2008-Img 0437.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Tehachapi Pass Wind Farm]], in the Tehachapi Wind Resource Area.]]
'''Tehachapi Wind Resource Area''', also known as '''TWRA''', is considered the largest wind resource area of California. 

==Geography==
The resource area is located in [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] at the southern end of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] and spreads through [[Tehachapi Pass]] into the adjacent [[Mojave Desert]]. It is the home of many large scale [[wind farm]]s which collectively produce more power than any other wind development in the United States. 

==Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project==
The development of the Tehachapi Wind Resource Area has been in the planning since 2009 in conjunction with the development of the [[Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project]]. The transmission project was required to support new wind developments in the area at the time including Alta-Oak Creek Mojave Project which was part of [[Alta Wind Energy Center]], the largest wind farm in the world {{as of|lc=y|2013}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Development of the TehachapiWind Resource Area|url=ftp://ftp.cpuc.ca.gov/gopher-data/environ/tehachapi_renewables/TRTP_Final%20EIR-EIS/EIR-EIS/6-TWRA.pdf|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5346">{{merge|EZFW|discuss=Talk:Zero-fuel weight#Proposed merger: EZFW→Zero-fuel weight|date=July 2018}}

The '''zero-fuel weight''' (ZFW) of an aircraft is the total weight of the airplane and all its contents, minus the total weight of the [[usable fuel]] on board. Unusable fuel is included in ZFW.

For example, if an aircraft is flying at a weight of 5,000&amp;nbsp;kg and the weight of fuel on board is 500&amp;nbsp;kg, the ZFW is 4,500&amp;nbsp;kg.  Some time later, after 100&amp;nbsp;kg of fuel has been used, the total weight of the airplane is 4,900&amp;nbsp;kg, the weight of fuel is 400&amp;nbsp;kg, and the ZFW is unchanged at 4,500&amp;nbsp;kg.

As a flight progresses and fuel is consumed, the total weight of the airplane reduces, but the ZFW remains constant (unless some part of the load, such as parachutists or stores, is jettisoned in flight).

For many types of airplane, the [[airworthiness]] limitations include a maximum zero fuel weight.{{#tag:ref|[[Federal Aviation Regulations|14CFR]] 110.2 "''Maximum zero fuel weight'' means the maximum permissible weight of an aircraft with no disposable fuel or oil."&lt;ref&gt;14CFR 110.2 ''Definitions'' [http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/989583414C4256F786257833005A282E?OpenDocument FAR 110.2] FAA Regulatory and Guidance Library. Retrieved 2016/08/19&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

== Maximum zero fuel weight ==

The maximum zero fuel weight (MZFW) is the maximum weight allowed before usable fuel and other specified usable agents (engine injection fluid, and other consumable propulsion agents) are loaded in defined sections of the aircraft as limited by strength and airworthiness requirements. It may include usable fuel in specified tanks when carried in lieu of payload. The addition of usable and consumable items to the zero fuel weight must be in accordance with the applicable government regulations so that airplane structure and airworthiness requirements are not exceeded.

=== Maximum zero fuel weight in aircraft operations ===

When an aircraft is being loaded with crew, passengers, baggage and freight it is most important to ensure that the ZFW does not exceed the MZFW. When an aircraft is being loaded with fuel it is most important to ensure that the takeoff weight will not exceed the [[Maximum takeoff weight#Maximum permissible takeoff weight or maximum allowed takeoff weight|maximum permissible takeoff weight]].

MZFW : The maximum weight of an aircraft prior to fuel being loaded.{{#tag:ref|14CFR 125.9(c) "For the purposes of this part, ''maximum zero fuel weight'' means the maximum permissible weight of an aircraft with no disposable fuel or oil." &lt;ref&gt;14CFR 125.9(c) ''Definitions''. 
[http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/FC47C7994CFD4A7886256959004D976D?OpenDocument FAR 125.9] FAA Regulatory and Guidance Library. Retrieved 2016/08/19&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

:&lt;math&gt;ZFW + FOB = TOW&lt;/math&gt;

For any aircraft with a defined MZFW, the maximum payload (&lt;math&gt;PL_{max}&lt;/math&gt;) can be calculated as the MZFW minus the OEW (operational empty weight)

:&lt;math&gt;PL_{max} = MZFW - OEW&lt;/math&gt;

===Maximum zero fuel weight in type certification===

The maximum zero fuel weight is an important parameter in demonstrating compliance with gust design criteria for [[transport category]] airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;14CFR 25.341(a)(6) ''Gust and turbulence loads''. [http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/C86DBFEBB41D816F86257DE80072BA20?OpenDocument FAR 25.341] FAA Regulatory and Guidance Library. Retrieved 2016/08/19&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wing bending relief ==

In [[fixed-wing aircraft]], fuel is usually carried in the wings. Weight in the wings does not contribute as significantly to the [[bending moment]] in the wing as does weight in the [[fuselage]]. This is because the lift on the wings and the weight of the fuselage bend the wing tips upwards and the wing roots downwards; but the weight of the wings, including the weight of fuel in the wings, bend the wing tips downwards, providing relief to the bending effect on the wing.

When an airplane is being loaded, the capacity for extra weight in the wings is greater than the capacity for extra weight in the [[fuselage]].  Designers of airplanes can optimise the [[maximum takeoff weight]] and prevent overloading in the fuselage by specifying a MZFW.  This is usually done for large airplanes with [[Cantilever#Aircraft|cantilever]] wings. (Airplanes with [[Strut#Aircraft|strut-braced]] wings achieve substantial wing bending relief by having the load of the fuselage applied by the strut mid-way along the wing semi-span. Extra wing bending relief cannot be achieved by particular placement of the fuel. There is usually no MZFW specified for an airplane with a strut-braced wing.)

Most small airplanes do not have an MZFW specified among their limitations.  For these airplanes with cantilever wings, the loading case that must be considered when determining the [[maximum takeoff weight]] is the airplane with zero fuel and all disposable load in the fuselage.  With zero fuel in the wing the only wing bending relief is due to the weight of the wing.
