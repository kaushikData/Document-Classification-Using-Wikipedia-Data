      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1453">'''Agathon Meurman''' (9 October 1826, [[Kangasala]] &amp;ndash; 17 January 1909, [[Helsinki]]) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] politician and journalist. He was one of the key persons of the [[Fennoman movement]] and since 1863 the leader of the [[Finnish Party]] together with [[Yrjö Sakari Yrjö-Koskinen]].&lt;ref name=sks&gt;[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/kb/artikkeli/4569/ Meurman, Agathon (1826 - 1909)] Finnish National Biography.

In 1883–1890 Meurman published the first Finnish language encyclopaedia ''Sanakirja yleiseen sivistykseen kuuluvia tietoja varten''. It was mostly based on the German ''[[Meyers Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref name=sks/&gt;

'''''Blazing Saddles''''' is a 1974 American [[Satire|satirical]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] film directed by [[Mel Brooks]]. Starring [[Cleavon Little]] and [[Gene Wilder]], the film was written by Brooks, [[Andrew Bergman]], [[Richard Pryor]], Norman Steinberg and Al Uger, and was based on Bergman's story and draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getback.com/movie/blazing-saddles/1499232 |title=Director and Leading Actors |publisher=Getback.com |archive-date=October 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004054717/http://www.getback.com/movie/blazing-saddles/1499232 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] and is ranked No. 6 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|100 Years...100 Laughs]]'' list.

Brooks appears in three supporting roles, Governor William J. Le Petomane, a [[Yiddish]]-speaking Indian chief and “a director” in line to help invade Rock Ridge (a nod to Hitchcock); he also dubs lines for one of Lili von Shtupp's backing troupe. The supporting cast includes [[Slim Pickens]], [[Alex Karras]] and [[David Huddleston]], as well as Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Madeline Kahn]] and [[Harvey Korman]]. Bandleader [[Count Basie]] has a cameo as himself.

The film satirizes the [[racism]] obscured by myth-making [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] accounts of the [[American frontier|American West]], with the hero being a [[African Americans|black]] [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] in an all-white town. The film is full of deliberate [[anachronism]]s, from the [[Count Basie Orchestra]] playing "[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]" in the Wild West, to Slim Pickens referring to the ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'', to the [[German Army (1935–1945)|German army]] of [[World War II]].

==Plot==
On the [[American frontier]] of 1874, a new railroad will soon be rerouted through Rock Ridge, in order to avoid running through [[quicksand]]. The conniving attorney general Hedley Lamarr wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town. The townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker, who was about to be executed for assaulting a white foreman. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy.

After an initial hostile reception (where Sheriff Bart has to take himself hostage to escape), he relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the "Waco Kid", to overcome the townspeople's hostility. He subdues Mongo, an immensely strong, dim-witted, but philosophical henchman sent to kill him; when he visits the railroad work site and discovers their interest in the land, the Waco Kid outshoots Taggart and his thugs; finally, Bart outmaneuvers German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtüpp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen, Nazis, and [[Methodism|Methodists]].

Three miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the white townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers, who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town, as a diversion;  with no people in it, though, Bart realizes it will not fool the villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the "Gov. William J. Le Petomane Thruway", forcing the raiding party to turn back for "a shitload of dimes" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town populated with dummies, which are boobytrapped with dynamite bombs. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers storm the villains.

The resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr's thugs breaks the [[fourth wall]], spilling onto a neighboring set, where director Buddy Bizarre is directing a [[Busby Berkeley]]-style top-hat-and-tails musical number; then into the studio commissary for a food fight; and then out of the [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. film lot]] into the streets of Burbank. Lamarr, realizing he has been beaten, hails a taxi and orders the driver to "drive me off this picture". He ducks into [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], which is playing the premiere of ''Blazing Saddles''. As he settles into his seat, he sees Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr's escape, and then shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into Grauman's to watch the end of the film, in which Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on. Riding out of town, he finds Jim, and invites him along to "nowhere special". They ride off into the sunset on horseback, but stop at a chauffeured [[stretch limousine]] and continue outward in the vehicle.

'''Cast notes'''
* [[Count Basie]] and his [[Count Basie Orchestra|orchestra]] make a cameo appearance, playing "[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]" in the middle of the desert as Bart rides toward Rock Ridge to assume the post of sheriff.
* Brooks appears in three on-screen roles: Governor Le Petomane, the [[Yiddish]]-speaking Indian chief, and an applicant for Hedley Lamarr's thug army (an aviator wearing sunglasses and a [[flight jacket]]). He also has two off-screen voice roles, as one of Lili's German chorus boys during "I'm Tired", and as a grouchy moviegoer.&lt;ref name=crick&gt;Crick, Robert Alan. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LbtuDkazJfQC&amp;q=aviator ''The Big Screen Comedies of Mel Brooks''] McFarland, 2002. {{ISBN|9780786443260}}. pp. 65-66. Quote:"As for Mel Brooks himself, his aviator and voice-overs as a German dancer and cranky film-goer provide funny cameos...". The book credits him as playing "William J. LePetomane/Indian Chief/Aviator/Voice of German Dancer/Voice of Moviegoer."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The idea for the film came from a story outline written by [[Andrew Bergman]] that he originally intended to develop and produce himself. "I wrote a first draft called ''Tex-X''" (a play on [[Malcolm X]]'s name), he said. "[[Alan Arkin]] was hired to direct and [[James Earl Jones]] was going to play the sheriff. That fell apart, as things often do."&lt;ref name=bergman&gt;{{cite news |url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/andrew-bergman/|title='It’s a Good-Natured Insanity.' Andrew Bergman on Screenwriting|last=Swinson|first=Brock|date=June 24, 2016|newspaper=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks was taken with the story, which he described as "hip talk—1974 talk and expressions—happening in 1874 in the Old West", and purchased the film rights from Bergman. Though he had not worked with a writing team since ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', he hired a group of writers (including Bergman) to expand the outline, and posted a large sign: "Please do not write a polite script."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-news/mel-brooks-on-blazing-new-comedic-trails-in--blazing-saddles-215405381.html | title = Mel Brooks on Blazing New Comedic Trails in 'Blazing Saddles' | first = Andrew | last = Pockross | date = May 9, 2014 | accessdate = May 9, 2014 | publisher = [[Yahoo! Movies]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks described the writing process as chaotic: "''Blazing Saddles'' was more or less written in the middle of a drunken fistfight. There were five of us all yelling loudly for our ideas to be put into the movie. Not only was I the loudest, but luckily I also had the right as director to decide what was in or out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/mel-brooks-on-screenwriting/|title=Mel Brooks on Screenwriting|last=Swinson|first=Brock|date=January 14, 2016|newspaper=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergman remembers the room being just as chaotic, telling ''Creative Screenwriting'', "In the beginning, we had five people. One guy left after a couple of weeks. Then, it was basically me, Mel, [[Richard Pryor|Richie Pryor]] and Norman Steinberg. Richie left after the first draft and then Norman, Mel and I wrote the next three or four drafts. It was a riot. It was a rioter’s room!"&lt;ref name=bergman /&gt;

The original title, ''Tex X'', was rejected, as were ''Black Bart'' and ''Purple Sage''. Brooks said he finally conceived ''Blazing Saddles'' one morning while taking a shower.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/dvd/review/2001/05/08/blazing/|title=Salon: in-depth news, politics, business, technology &amp; culture|website=Salon|accessdate=November 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114084925/http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/dvd/review/2001/05/08/blazing/|archive-date=January 14, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the movie's title song, Brooks advertised in the trade papers for a "[[Frankie Laine]]-type" singer; to his surprise, Laine himself offered his services. "Frankie sang his heart out ... and we didn't have the heart to tell him it was a spoof. He never heard the whip cracks; we put those in later. We got so lucky with his serious interpretation of the song."&lt;ref name="libretto"&gt;From the libretto of the La-LaLand Records soundtrack album&lt;/ref&gt;

Casting was problematic. Richard Pryor was Brooks' original choice to play the Sheriff Bart, but the studio, claiming his history of drug arrests made him uninsurable, refused to approve financing with Pryor as the star.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; Cleavon Little was cast in the role, and Pryor remained as a writer. Brooks offered the other leading role, the Waco Kid, to [[John Wayne]]; he declined, deeming the film "too [[pornographic movie|blue]]" for his family-oriented image, but assured Brooks that "he would be the first one in line to see it."&lt;ref&gt;Staff (May 20, 2016) [http://www.metro.us/philadelphia/mel-brooks-on-john-wayne-improv-and-the-presidential-race/zsJpes---t1y4luA8q4ho/ "Mel Brooks on John Wayne, Improv and the Presidential Race"] ''Metro Philadelphia''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gig Young]] was cast, but he collapsed during his first scene from what was later determined to be [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome]], and Gene Wilder was flown in to replace him.&lt;ref name=donnelly&gt;{{cite book|last=Donnelly|first=Paul |title=Fade To Black: A Book of Movie Obituaries|publisher=Omnibus|year=2005|edition=3|page=746|isbn=1-84449-430-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parish|first= James Robert |title=It's Good to Be the King: The Seriously Funny Life of Mel Brooks|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2008|page=9|isbn=0-470-22526-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Carson]] and Wilder both turned down the Hedley Lamarr role before Harvey Korman was cast.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy White (editor)|White, Timothy]] (March 22, 1979) "Johnny Carson: The ''Rolling Stone'' Interview" in [[Jann Wenner|Wenner, Jann S.]] ed. (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=t2CaFeDa_m0C&amp;pg=PT109&amp;q=Johnny%20Carson:%20The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Interview ''The Rolling Stone Interviews''] New York: Little, Brown. {{ISBN|978-0-316-02313-9}}. Retrieved May 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Madeline Kahn objected when Brooks asked to see her legs during her audition. "She said, 'So it’s THAT kind of an audition?{{'"}} Brooks recalled. "I explained that I was a happily married man and that I needed someone who could straddle a chair with her legs like [[Marlene Dietrich]] in ''[[Destry Rides Again]].'' So she lifted her skirt and said, 'No touching.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="nypost"/&gt;

Brooks had numerous conflicts over content with Warner Bros. executives, including frequent use of the word "[[nigger]]", Lili Von Shtupp's seduction scene, the cacophony of flatulence around the campfire, and Mongo punching out a horse. Brooks, whose contract gave him final content control, declined to make any substantive changes, with the exception of cutting Bart's final line during Lili's seduction: "I hate to disappoint you, ma'am, but you're sucking my arm."&lt;ref name="Madison2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Madison, William V.|title=Madeline Kahn: Being the Music, A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CvAaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT119|date=May 1, 2015|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-61703-762-7|pages=119-}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked later about the many "nigger" references, Brooks said he received consistent support from Pryor and Little. He added, "If they did a remake of ''Blazing Saddles'' today [2012], they would leave out the N-word. And then, you've got no movie."&lt;ref name="DGA-Quarterly-summer2012"&gt;

}} Page 36: '''Q:''' ''Blazing Saddles'' also makes frequent use of the "N-word." Could you get away with that today? '''A:''' Never. If they did a remake of ''Blazing Saddles'' today, they would leave out the N-word. And then, you've got no movie. And I wouldn't have used it so much if I didn't have Richard Pryor with me on the set as one of my writers. And Cleavon Little [as Sheriff Bart] was great. Even though it was allowed, I kept asking Cleavon, "Is that all right there? Is that too much there? Am I pushing this?" and he'd say, "no, no, no, it's perfect there."&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks said he received many letters of complaint after the film's release, " ... but of course, most of them were from white people."&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt;

The film was almost not released. "When we screened it for executives, there were few laughs", said Brooks. "The head of distribution said, 'Let’s dump it and take a loss.' But [studio president John] Calley insisted they open it in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago as a test. It became the studio's top moneymaker that summer."&lt;ref name="nypost"&gt;Lumenick, L.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}
While the film is now considered a classic comedy, critical reaction was mixed when the film was released. [[Vincent Canby]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/08/archives/screen-blazing-saddles-a-western-in-burlesque.html |title=Screen: 'Blazing Saddles', a Western in Burlesque |first=Vincent |last=Canby |work=The New York Times |date=February 8, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''Blazing Saddles'' has no dominant personality, and it looks as if it includes every gag thought up in every story conference. Whether good, bad or mild, nothing was thrown out. [[Woody Allen]]'s comedy, though very much a product of our Age of Analysis, recalls the wonder and discipline of people like [[Buster Keaton|Keaton]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]]. Mr. Brooks's sights are lower. His brashness is rare, but his use of anachronism and anarchy recalls not the great film comedies of the past, but the middling ones like the Hope-Crosby [[Road to ...|"Road" pictures]]. With his talent he should do much better than that.}}

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars and called it a "crazed grabbag of a movie that does everything to keep us laughing except hit us over the head with a [[rubber chicken]]. Mostly, it succeeds. It's an audience picture; it doesn't have a lot of classy polish and its structure is a total mess. But of course! What does that matter while Alex Karras is knocking a horse cold with a right cross to the jaw?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/blazing-saddles-1974 |title=Blazing Saddles |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=February 7, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film grossed $119.5 million at the box office, becoming only the tenth film up to that time to pass the $100 million mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=blazingsaddles.htm |title=Blazing Saddles (1974) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=January 1, 1982 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[film-critic]]s aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has 90% positive reviews, saying, "Daring, provocative, and laugh-out-loud funny, ''Blazing Saddles'' is a gleefully vulgar spoof of Westerns that marks a high point in Mel Brooks' storied career." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blazing_saddles/|title=Blazing Saddles on Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=October 5, 2012|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hedy Lamarr]] sued Warner Bros., charging that the film's running parody of her name infringed on her right to privacy. Brooks said he was flattered; the studio settled out of court for a small sum and an apology for “almost using her name." Brooks said that Lamarr "never got the joke."&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;Interview: Mel Brooks. ''Blazing Saddles'' (DVD). Burbank, California: Warner Brothers Pictures/Warner Home Video, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7907-5735-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
While addressing his group of bad guys, Harvey Korman's character reminds them that, although they are risking their lives, he is "risking an almost certain [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]!" Korman did not receive an Oscar bid, but the film did get three nominations in [[47th Academy Awards|1974]]: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Madeline Kahn, who lost to [[Ingrid Bergman]] in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]''), [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] (losing out to ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''), and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Music, Original Song]] (the title song, which lost to "We May Never Love Like This Again", also from ''The Towering Inferno''). The film also earned two [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] awards nominations, for [[BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer|Best Newcomer]] (Cleavon Little) and [[BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://awards.bafta.org/award/1975/film/most-promising-newcomer-to-leading-film-roles "Film | Most Promising Newcomer To Leading Film Roles in 1975"] BAFTA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://awards.bafta.org/award/1975/film/screenplay "Film | Screenplay in 1975"] BAFTA&lt;/ref&gt;

The film won the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for "[[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen]]" for writers Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, and Alan Uger.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/awards|title=Blazing Saddles|accessdate=November 9, 2017|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ''Blazing Saddles'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:

==Legacy==
===TV pilot===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
A television series titled ''Black Bart'' was produced for CBS based on Bergman's original story. It featured [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as Bart and [[Steve Landesberg]] as his drunkard sidekick, a former Confederate officer named "Reb Jordan". Other cast members included [[Millie Slavin]] and [[Noble Willingham]]. Bergman is listed as the sole creator.

CBS aired the pilot once on April 4, 1975. The pilot episode featured guest appearances by [[Gerrit Graham]] and [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] and was written by Michael Elias and Rich Eustis. Elias and Eutis later created and executive produced the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Head of the Class]]'' (1986-1991).

Interviewed in 1996, Steve Landesberg said ''Black Bart'' "was like a joke. ... We did the pilot, and CBS dumped it at the end of the 1975 season in April or May on a Friday. We thought it was done, then CBS tells us to come back and film six more episodes. And then another six. Six episodes each season, when an order was usually for 24 or 26. I was on ''[[Barney Miller]]'' by that point, and we'd film during the winter break when all other TV shows were on hiatus. And they never aired any of them. It was like a sick joke. If I wasn't under contract I would have walked, but they were paying me so I can't complain."

In 1989, Louis Gossett, Jr. told ''Entertainment Tonight'', "CBS and Warner Bros. made a deal. ... The deal was that CBS would get to air ''Blazing Saddles'', and any sequels from the movie, in exchange for co-producing a TV show. At the time Warners wanted to make ''Blazing Saddles'' into a comedy series of films, a new one coming out every year or so. They wanted to use the model that the Brits had for the ''[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]'' films. But [Mel] Brooks had a clause in his contract that said Warner had to keep producing ''Blazing Saddles'' stories, in the movies or TV, or they'd lose the rights to make sequels. The TV show was a way to keep the rights. They didn't have to air it, just keep producing it. So for four years I spent my winter on a soundstage being paid to be in show that would never see the light of day, just so Warners could keep the sequel rights to ''Blazing Saddles''. By 1979 they finally figured out the market had changed and they weren't going to make any sequels, so we were cancelled, if a show that never was supposed to air can be cancelled."

Mel Brooks addressed the existence of the ''Black Bart'' series in 2005: "My lawyers, bless their souls, came to me and said, 'Warner Bros. is going to try and take away your control of the movie. Let's put in a crazy condition that says they can't do any sequels unless they make it right away or make a TV show out of it within six months.' Which is brilliant. They couldn't make a sequel in six months, and the movie was too vulgar to be a TV show. Now it would air in family hour if that was still a thing. So the lawyers put that in, never thinking they'd make a TV show. ... In 1977, three years later, Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another ''Blazing Saddles'', and I say, 'No. You don't have the right to do that.' They say, 'Yes we do, we've been making a TV series and still control the rights.' What TV series? I haven't seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it. [[Oy gevalt]]! Well, management changed and they never did ''Blazing Saddles 2'', and as far as I know they're still making that stupid show to this day."

The pilot episode of ''Black Bart'' was later included as a bonus feature on the ''Blazing Saddles'' 30th Anniversary DVD and the [[Blu-ray]] disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0121113|Black Bart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundtrack===
The first studio-licensed release of the full music soundtrack to ''Blazing Saddles'' was on La-La Land Records on August 26, 2008. Remastered from original studio vault elements, the limited edition CD (a run of 3000) features the songs from the film as well as composer [[John Morris (composer)|John Morris]]'s score. Instrumental versions of all the songs are bonus tracks on the disc. The disc features exclusive liner notes featuring comments from Mel Brooks and John Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lalalandrecords.com/BlazingSaddles.html |title=''Blazing Saddles'' press release at La-La Land Records |publisher=Lalalandrecords.com |accessdate=November 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113172746/http://www.lalalandrecords.com/BlazingSaddles.html |archivedate=November 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
The 2017 animated film ''[[Blazing Samurai]]'', starring [[Michael Cera]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Michelle Yeoh]], and [[Ricky Gervais]], has been characterized by its creators as "equally inspired by and an homage to ''Blazing Saddles''." Brooks served as an executive producer for the production, and voiced one of the characters.&lt;ref name=Nov2015D&gt;{{cite news|last1=Busch|first1=Anita|title=‘Blazing Samurai’ Lands A-List Voice Talent Led By Samuel L.

===Possible stage production===
In September 2017, Mel Brooks indicated his desire to do a stage play version of ''Blazing Saddles'' in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/21/stupidly-politically-correct-society-death-comedy-warns-veteran/ |title='Stupidly politically correct society is the death of comedy', warns veteran comedian Mel Brooks |last=Sabur |first=Rozina |date=September 21, 2017 |website=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |accessdate=September 22, 2017 |quote=The director said he hopes he is able to recreate Blazing Saddles on the stage in the future.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Builder's risk insurance''' is a special type of [[property insurance]] which indemnifies against damage to buildings while they are under construction.&lt;ref&gt;''The Architects Handbook of Professional Practice, Twelfth Edition'', American Institute of Architects&lt;/ref&gt;  Builder's risk insurance is "coverage that protects a person's or organization's insurable interest in materials, fixtures and/or equipment being used in the construction or renovation of a building or structure should those items sustain physical loss or damage from a covered cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adjustersinternational.com/AdjustingToday/ATfullinfo.cfm?start=1&amp;page_no=1&amp;pdfID=4 |title=Builder's Risk Insurance: Specialized Coverage for Construction Projects |accessdate=2011-05-06 |publisher=''Adjusting Today'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Necessity ==
Buildings are subject to many different risks while under construction.  They may catch fire, be damaged by high winds, or fall victim to other [[force majeure]].  A principle of common law is that any new construction or other improvement to land becomes property of the owner of the land - the title holder - once there has been an "improvement" to the owner's site. Builder's risk insurance indemnifies against some of these losses.

== Coverage ==
Builder's risk covers perils such as fire, wind, theft and vandalism and many more.  It typically does not cover perils such as earthquake, flood or wind in beach zones unless the policy has been specifically endorsed to do so.  However, earthquake riders can be very economical, depending on where your project is located and should be considered. These [[policies]] also do not cover accidents and injuries at the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/civil/db/DBS/glossary.cgi?word=Builders'+Risk+Insurance |title=Builders' Risk Insurance |accessdate=2011-03-02 |publisher=[[University of Colorado]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is intended to terminate when the work has been completed and the property is ready for use or occupancy. If you are going to properly setup your policy, coverage should be effective prior to when the materials are delivered to the job site.  Coverage ends upon the earlier of closing of the sale, occupancy or the policy expiration date.  After builder risk coverage expires, due to sale or occupancy, the new owner should take out permanent property insurance on the building such as a home owner's policy or a commercial property policy.

== Who buys builder's risk insurance? ==
Coverage is often purchased by the custom builder or general contractor and may also be purchased by the property owner. Builder's risk coverage may be necessary to show proof of insurance to comply with local city, county, and state building codes and is often required as a condition to many contracts.
However, many architects believe that it is the property owner who should have the builder's risk policy, because they have already paid for the improvements to their land, and if the builder receives the funds directly from a claim, theoretically, he/she could abscond with that benefit. It is far safer for the property owner to obtain the builder's risk policy, because they already own the building, even while it is under construction. If something happens to the under-construction project, then they should be the beneficiary and control how it is spent. Yes, the builder ends up receiving the funds in the end, to rebuild damage, but this method gives the control of the insurance benefit to the owner.

== Alternatives ==
If the project involves renovations or additions to an existing building, the owner's existing property insurance may cover the work under construction, eliminating the need for builder's risk insurance.  (Policies vary.)  However, in the case of new buildings under construction on vacant sites, the owner may not have an existing policy that provides coverage.

'''''Circle of Magic''''', also known as '''''The Wizard's Apprentice''''' in the [[United Kingdom]], is a series of eight [[junior novels]] written by [[Debra Doyle]] and [[James D. Macdonald]]. The books are set in a high-fantasy pseudo-medieval era. The series protagonist is young [[squire]] Randal of Doun, whose life is changed forever when he meets the Master Wizard, Madoc The Wayfarer, and forsakes his home to pursue the study of magic. The series chronicles his apprenticeship at the Schola Sorceriae, the School of Wizardry, through his status of Journeyman and finally to his rise as a full Master of the Art.

==Synopsis==
'''Book I. School of Wizardry'''

The protagonist, Randal, a young boy preparing for knighthood at Castle Doun, leaves his old life behind and follows Madoc the Wayfarer, who takes him to study at the Schola Sorceriae in the city of Tarnsberg.  He struggles with his studies, aided by an elder student, Nick, and comforted by a young orphan lutenist, the girl Lys.  After he narrowly squeaks through exams, the young and charismatic Master Laerg takes an interest in Randal, tutoring him in private; but his motives are less than honest.

'''Book II. The Secret of the Tower / Tournament and Tower'''

No longer an apprentice, but a journeyman, Randal leaves the Tarnsberg to travel the world.  Forbidden by the Regents of the Schola to use magic, Randal travels with Lys and his cousin Walter to gain the absolution of the retired Master Balpesh at his isolated tower.  But more than a master wizard is waiting for them there.

'''Book III. The Wizard's Statue / City by the Sea'''

Traveling with Lys to visit Nick, who gave up wizardry for carpentry, Randal is left a mysterious ivory figurine by a dying journeyman wizard.  Suddenly, he is pursued by numerous parties all of whom want the statue.  Meanwhile, the statue may have intentions of its own.

'''Book IV. Danger in the Palace / The Prince's Players'''

Wrought with grief, Randal journeys South with Lys to her native land of Occitania, augmenting her music with magical displays of color.  However, his skills with illusion attract the attention of the court wizard of Peda; and before he knows it, Randal is flung headlong into court intrigue, where no one is who they appear to be.

'''Book V. The Wizard's Castle / The Prisoners of Bell Castle'''

When they vow to guard a shipment of gold, Randal and his friends, Lys and Walter, encounter lethal enemies who could keep them trapped forever in the castle of a powerful warlord.

'''Book VI. The High King's Daughter'''

Randal helps a princess that can't return to her own world and to the throne until the spells that guard her are broken.

'''Book VII. Mystery at Wizardry School'''

Randal, now a court wizard for Queen Diamante, agrees to tutor an apprentice who has been struggling with his studies at the Schola Sorceriae. However, he quickly begins to suspect that the apprentice has unknowingly been tainted by dark magic.

'''Book VIII. Voice of the Ice'''

Randal and his friend Lys, the court bard for Queen Diamante, journey to the land of Vaskinna so that Lys can participate in a musical contest that takes place once every 10 years. After surviving attempts to prevent Randal from making it there, they discover that the true reason the contest is held is more sinister than they would have expected.

A '''cloak of invisibility''' is a fictional theme and a device under some scientific inquiry. In folklore, mythology and fairy tales, a cloak of invisibility appears either as a magical item used by duplicitous characters or an item worn by a hero to fulfill a quest. It is a common theme in Welsh and Germanic folklore, and may originate with the [[cap of invisibility]] seen in ancient Greek myths. The motif falls under "D1361.12 magic cloak of invisibility" in the [[Stith Thompson]] motif index scheme.

==In fiction==
Cloaks of invisibility are magical items found in folklore and [[fairy tale]]s. Such cloaks are common in [[Welsh mythology]]; a "Mantle of Invisibility" is described in the tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1100) as one of [[King Arthur]]'s most prized possessions.&lt;ref name="Stephens"&gt;Stephens (1998) p. 479&lt;/ref&gt; The mantle is described again, and in more detail,&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt; in the ''[[Breuddwyd Rhonabwy]],'' and is later listed as one of the [[Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain]]. A similar mantle appears in the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi#Branwen.2C Daughter of Ll.C5.B7r|Second Branch of the Mabinogi]], in which it is used by [[Cassivellaunus|Caswallawn]] to assassinate the seven stewards left behind by [[Bran the Blessed]] and usurp the throne.&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gantz |first=Jeffrey |date=1987 |title=The Mabinogion |location=New York| publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-14-044322-3 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English fairy tale ''[[Jack the Giant Killer]]'', the hero is rewarded with several magical gifts by a giant he has spared, among them a coat of invisibility. [[Iona Opie|Iona]] and [[Peter Opie]] observe in ''The Classic Fairy Tales'' (1974), that Jack's coat may have been borrowed from the ''[[Tom Thumb|Tale of Tom Thumb]]'' or from Norse mythology, but they also draw comparisons with the Celtic stories of the ''Mabinogion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Opie |first1=Iona |authorlink=Iona Opie |last2=Opie |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Opie |date=1992 |origyear=1974 |title=The Classic Fairy Tales |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-211559-6 |pages=47–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The counterpart in Japan is the {{nihongo|kakuremino|隠れ蓑}}, a magical "straw cape" or "raincoat" of invisibility. In the folktale of the "Peach Boy" ''[[Momotarō]]'', one of the treasures the hero collects from the ogres is a cape of invisibility, paralleling the story of Jack the giant-slayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eberts |first1=Ray E. |last2=Eberts |first2=Cindelyn G. |title=The myths of Japanese quality |publisher=Prentice-Hall |date=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4S3AAAAIAAJ |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Allen|date=1883|volume=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ektAAAAIAAJ|chapter=XVII. Wights and Elves|pages=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grimms clarify that Sîfrit's ''kappe'' is a [[cape]] that covers not just the head but enshrouds the body, though in later times ''tarnkappe'' came to be regarded as a [[cap of invisibility]]. The ''tarnkappe'' (or ''tarnkeppelin''&lt;ref&gt;Müllenhoff (1874) ed., ''Laurin'', v. 485&lt;/ref&gt;) is also owned by the dwarf king who is the title character in ''[[Legends about Theodoric the Great#Laurin/ Der kleine Rosengarten (The Small Rose Garden)|Laurin]]''. In different passages or variant manuscripts of these works, the ''tarnkappe'' is also referred to as the ''tarnhût'' (mod. Ger. ''[[wikt:Haut|Haut]]'' "skin")&lt;ref name="grimm-vol2-p462"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettmüller (1829) ed., ''Kunech Laurin'', v. 39 and note, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; or ''hehlkappe'' (mod. Ger. ''[[wikt:hehlen|hehlen]]'' "to hide").&lt;ref&gt;von der Hagen (1807) ed., ''Der Nibelungen Lied'' ms. B 1735, 2614&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettmüller (1829) ed.,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern adaptations===
In the original epic ''Nibelungenlied,'' the hero's cloak not only grants him [[invisibility]], but also increases his strength, to win over the Icelandic queen [[Brünhild]]. In [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', the cloak becomes a magic helmet called the [[Tarnhelm]], which also imparts the ability to transform upon its wearer. When Fritz Lang adapted ''Nibelungenlied'' for the movie screen in his 1924 film ''[[Die Nibelungen]]'', Siegfried uses a veil or net of invisibility gained from the dwarf [[Alberich]]. Another film from the same year to use a cloak of invisibility was [[Raoul Walsh]]'s ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'', in which the cloak plays a pivotal role.
[[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] uses the idea of an invisibility cloak in his 1931 novel ''[[A Fighting Man of Mars]]''. The movie ''[[Erik the Viking]]'' humorously depicts the title character using a  cloak of invisibility, which he does not realize apparently works only on elderly men. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Frodo's elven cloak camouflaged him so that the enemy could see "nothing more than a boulder where the [[Hobbit]]s were".

Camouflaging cloaks form a central plot element in [[Samuel R. Delany]]'s 1975 novel ''[[Dhalgren]]''.

Cloaks of invisibility also exist in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of novels by [[J.K. Rowling]]. Harry Potter uses a Cloak of Invisibility, that was passed down to him by his father, to sneak into forbidden areas of his school and remain unseen. It is later revealed that this specific cloak was once owned by Death himself, making it one of the [[Deathly Hallows]].

Also found in popular fiction, ''[[The Secret History]]'', by [[Donna Tartt]], 1992. The character, Richard, says, "I became expert at making myself invisible"...."Sunday afternoons, my cloak of invisibility around my shoulders, I would sit in the infirmary for sometimes six hours at a time....".

==In science==
{{Main|Cloaking device}}&lt;!--Metascreen microwave invisibility cloak--&gt;
On October 19, 2006, a cloak was produced that routed microwaves of a particular frequency around a [[copper]] cylinder in a way that made them emerge almost as if there were nothing there. The cloak was made from [[metamaterial]]s. It cast a small shadow, which the designers hope to fix.

The device obscures a defined two dimensional region and only at a particular microwave frequency. Work on achieving similar results with visible light is in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, cloaking a human-sized object at visible wavelengths appears to have low probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1126/science.330.6011.1622|author= Robert F.

On the other hand, a group of researchers connected with [[Berkeley Lab]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] believe that cloaking at optical  frequencies is indeed possible. Furthermore, it appears within reach. Their solution to the hurdles presented by cloaking issues are dielectrics. These nonconducting materials ([[dielectric]]s) are used for a carpet cloak, which serves as an optical cloaking device.&lt;ref name=Yarris&gt;

{{bq|text=We have come up with a new solution to the problem of invisibility based on the use of dielectric (nonconducting) materials.  Our optical cloak not only suggests that true invisibility materials are within reach, it also represents a major step towards transformation optics, opening the door to manipulating light at will for the creation of powerful new microscopes and faster computers.}}

Furthermore, a new cloaking system was announced in the beginning of 2011 that is effective in visible light and hides macroscopic objects, i.e. objects that can be seen with the human eye. The cloak is constructed from ordinary, and easily obtainable [[calcite]]. The crystal consists of two pieces configured according to specific parameters. The calcite is able to refract the light around a solid object positioned between the crystals. The system employs the natural [[birefringence]] of the calcite. From outside the system the object is not visible "for at least 3 orders of magnitude larger than the [[light|wavelength of light]] in all three dimensions." The calcite solves for the limitations of attempting to cloak with metallic inclusions - this method does not require a [[nanofabrication]] process as has become necessary with the other methods of cloaking. The nanofabrication process is time consuming and limits the size of the cloaked region to a microscopic area. The system works best under green light. In addition the researchers appear to be optimistic about a practical cloaking device in the future:&lt;ref name=natCom&gt;{{cite journal

{{bq|text=In summary, we have demonstrated the first macroscopic cloak operating at visible frequencies, which transforms a deformed mirror into a flat one from all viewing angles. The cloak is capable of hiding three-dimensional objects three to four orders of magnitudes larger than optical wavelengths, and therefore, it satisfies a layman's definition of an invisibility cloak: namely, the cloaking effect can be directly observed without the help of microscopes. Because our work solves several major issues typically associated with cloaking''':''' size, bandwidth, loss, and image distortion, it paves the way for future practical cloaking devices}}

Another design calls for tiny metal needles to be fitted into a hairbrush-shaped cone at angles and lengths that would force light to pass around the cloak. This would make everything inside the cone appear to vanish because the light would no longer reflect off it. "It looks pretty much like fiction, I do realize, but it's completely in agreement with the laws of physics," said lead researcher [[Vladimir Shalaev]], a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue. "Ideally, if we make it real it would work exactly like [[Harry Potter]]'s [[invisibility]] cloak," he said. "It's not going to be heavy because there's going to be very little metal in it."

Furtherfurthermore, on April 30, 2009, two teams of scientists developed a cloak that rendered objects invisible to near-infrared light. Unlike its predecessors, this technology did not utilize metals, which improves cloaking since metals cause some light to be lost. Researchers mentioned that since the approach can be scaled down further in size, it was a major step towards a cloak that would work for visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1680321/scientists_develop_new_invisibility_cloak_technology/index.html |title=Scientists Develop New Invisibility Cloak Technology |publisher=redOrbit |date=April 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems of refraction and opacity===
The headlined claims that laboratory results with metamaterials are demonstrations of prototype invisibility cloaks conflicts with two facts resulting from fundamental characteristics of the underlying [[metamaterial]] technology:
* These materials are, by nature, highly [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive]], hence light passing around a "cloaked" object would be strongly [[refraction|refracted]] ([[prism (optics)|prisms]] are not invisible).
* Currently light passing through these materials is partially absorbed, making the shield partially  opaque.
* Perfect cloaking by materials may be problematic, when taking [[causality]] into account.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-14-25-12457 |title=On perfect cloaking |first=David A. B |last=Miller |journal=Optics Express |volume=14 |issue=25 |pages=12457–12466 |date=2006 |doi=10.1364/OE.14.012457|bibcode = 2006OExpr..1412457M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoustic cloaking===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Though perfect cloaking based on invisible paint is impossible if detectors (such as microphones) and sources (such as loudspeakers) are placed round a volume and if a particular formula is used to calculate the signals to be fed to the sources, perfect cloaking is possible. Such perfect cloaking does require that the information can flow through the volume fast enough and the calculations can be performed fast enough so that the necessary information can get to the sources on the far side of the volume fast enough. As a result, perfect cloaking for light is still probably at least very difficult if not impossible. For sound waves, though, such perfect cloaking is possible in principle; an object could therefore be made invisible to sonar, for example.

According to Fermat’s Principle, light follows the trajectory of the shortest optical path, that is, the path over which the integral of the refractive index function is minimal. Therefore, the refractive index of an optical medium determines how light propagates within it. Consequently, by a suitable choice of refractive index profile for an optical medium, light rays can be bent around and made to propagate in closed loops...

Janos Perczel, 22, an undergraduate student at St Andrews University in Fife,  has developed an optical sphere which could be used to create an "invisibility cloak". He said that by slowing down light by way of an optical illusion, the light can then be bent around an object to "conceal" it. Attempts have already been made to create invisibility cloaks but research shows that efforts are limited because any cloak would only work within certain backgrounds. But by slowing down the rays of light, Mr Perczel says the cloak wearer can move around ever-changing backgrounds.

Mr Perczel, from Hungary, came up with the idea under the guidance of "invisibility expert" Professor [[Ulf Leonhardt]], who teaches at the university's school of physics and astronomy. The student recognised the potential of the invisible sphere and spent eight months fine tuning his project. The key development lies in the ability of the sphere, an optical device, to not only remain invisible itself but to slow light.

According to Prof Leonhardt, all optical illusions can slow down rays of light and the sphere can be used to bend this illusion around an object, reflecting off it and making it appear to be invisible. Mr Perczel added: "When the light is bent it engulfs the object, much like water covering a rock sitting in a river bed, and carries on its path, making it seem as if nothing is there. Light however can only be sped up to a speed faster than it would travel in space, under certain conditions, and this restricts invisibility cloaks to work in a limited part of the spectrum, essentially just one colour. This would be ideal if somebody was planning to stand still in camouflage. However, the moment they start to move, the scenery would begin to distort, revealing the person under the cloak. By slowing all of the light down with an invisible sphere, it does not need to be accelerated to such high speeds and can therefore work in all parts of the spectrum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/offbeat/student-makes-invisibility-cloak-16034498.html |title=Student makes 'invisibility cloak' |publisher=Belfast Telegraph |date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View from Dekkersduin.jpg|thumb|The painting Dekkersduin]]
'''Dekkersduin''' is the title of a painting by the Dutch landscape painter [[Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch]] that he made in 1849. The painting offers a panorama view from the old hill in [[The Hague]] called [[Dekkersduin]], for which it is named. The painting offers a now historical view westwards towards [[Scheveningen]] along what would become the "Afvoerkanaal", a canal to refresh the water in the city canals with water from the dunes. The dune Dekkersduin was a favored place used by Weissenbruch and other painters of the [[Hague School]] because they liked the light effects on the plains. Today the entire area displayed in the painting has been built up and the hill itself has been leveled to make room for homes, offices and parks and only the turn in the canal offers a clue to the original position of the painter.

The painting was purchased from the artist by the [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]], where it hangs in the permanent collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3485">'''Discrimination &amp; National Security Initiative (DNSI)''' is a research organization affiliated with the Pluralism Project, a [[Harvard University]] project that studies religious diversity in the United States. 

Following the terrorists attacks of [[September 11, 2001]], several communities within the [[United States]] experienced and continue to endure a prolonged and wanton [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]]. In particular, [[Sikh]], [[Muslim]], [[Arab]], [[South Asian]], and other American communities have confronted verbal harassment, employment discrimination, physical assault, and even murder. For example, [[Balbir Singh Sodhi]], a turbaned Sikh, was murdered just days after [[9/11]].

In response to the post-9/11 climate and the need to understand how discrimination has impacted these targeted communities in the United States, [http://www.dnsi.org DNSI] was created. The purpose of the project is to examine the mistreatment of minority communities in times of war or national crisis.  DNSI is specifically interested in the human consequences of such mistreatment. In addition to performing research and releasing substantive reports, DNSI regularly notes relevant incidents and developments on its  [[blog]].

DNSI was officially established on December 18, 2004, the 60th anniversary of [[Korematsu v. United States]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case that upheld the forced exclusion of citizens of Japanese ancestry (''see'', [[Japanese American Internment]]). The dissenting justices warned of the use of perceived race, ethnicity, or national origin as a proxy for suspect qualities, including subversion and disloyalty to the union, during wartime. 

DNSI examines discrimination and its social impact not just in the aftermath of [[September 11, 2001]], but also in other historical and international contexts that implicate the tension between equality and concerns for national security, such as the backlash against [[Muslims]] after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] and the broader debate regarding assimilation and multiculturalism that is taking place in several Western societies (''see'', [[United Kingdom debate over veils]]).  

DNSI is directed by [[Valarie Kaur]] (creator, writer, and producer of the documentary, "Divided We Fall") and Dawinder “Dave” S. Sidhu (civil rights attorney). 

DNSI issued its first report, "''We are Americans Too: A Comparative Study of the Effects of 9/11 on South Asian Communities''," on the fifth anniversary of the [[9/11]] attacks.  The report addresses the impact of and the responses to the discrimination that [[South Asians]] faced since [[9/11]], focusing specifically on [[India]]n [[Hindus]], [[Pakistan]]i [[Muslims]], and [[Sikhs]] in the [[Washington, DC]] area.

Its second report, "''The Sikh Turban: Post-911 Challenges to this Article of Faith''," examines the tangible and intangible discrimination faced by turbaned Sikhs in the wake of the 9/11, terrorist attacks. This report, issued in the spring of 2008, provides an overview of Sikhism, incidents of discrimination, broader challenges to Sikh identity, and legal remedies available to victims.  The report is currently being adapted into an academic text.

[[File:Incubus.jpg|thumb|''Incubo'', 1870]]
'''Ephialtes''' (lit. "jumping on you") is an [[anxiety disorder]] identified as such by John Bond in 1753, along with other authors of those times, in his treatise "Incubus". The famous Greek physician [[Galen]] in the 2nd century AD had already named [[nightmares]] "Ephialtes".

The idea of an [[incubus]] as a causative factor in nightmares stemmed from the belief that some [[spirit]] or [[ghost|ghostly person]] crept in during the night and lay upon the sleeper, so as to constrict the chest and breathing—leading to a sense of [[suffocation]], side by side with a terrifying [[dream]] of being either crushed or (in the case of a woman) [[sexual violence|sexually violated]] by the (male) incubus or ephialtes. Sleepers thus set upon feel they are about to die—but as Bond (who was himself prone to nightmares) stated: "As soon as they shake off that vast [[oppression]], they are affected with a strong [[palpitation]], great [[anxiety]], languour, and uneasiness &amp;ndash; which symptoms gradually abate, and are succeeded by the pleasing reflection of having escaped such imminent danger" (p.&amp;nbsp;3).

{{nihongo|'''Shohei Baba'''|馬場 正平|Baba Shōhei|January 23, 1938 &amp;ndash; January 31, 1999}}, best known by his [[ring name]] {{nihongo|'''Giant Baba'''|ジャイアント馬場|Jaianto Baba}}, was a [[Japan]]ese [[Puroresu|professional wrestler]] and co-founder of [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) who, along with [[Antonio Inoki]], became one of the most famous Japanese wrestlers of his era, with a popularity in [[Japan]] comparable to [[Hulk Hogan]]'s in the [[United States]].

Among his many accomplisments, Baba was a [[PWF World Heavyweight Championship#Title history|four-time]] [[PWF World Heavyweight Championship|PWF World Heavyweight Champion]], [[NWA International Heavyweight Championship#Title history|three time]] [[NWA International Heavyweight Championship|NWA International Heavyweight Champion]] and a [[List of NWA World Heavyweight Champions|three-time]] [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]].

== Family ==
[[File:Child Giant Baba with his family.jpg|thumb|left|Child Giant Baba with his family (parents and older brother), before 1943.]]
Shohei Baba was born in [[Sanjo, Niigata|Sanjo]], [[Niigata Prefecture]], on January 23, 1938. Second son of Kazuo Baba, a [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]] trader at Yokkaichi, in the hometown, and his wife Mitsu, he had a brother, Shōichi, twenty years older and beloved of their mother, and two sisters, Yoshi and Aiko, respectively sixteen and four years older.

When he was a child, his father, a silent man, was ill and couldn't do much work. After the death of his older brother, enlisted by the [[Sendai]] troops and killed in the island of [[Guadalcanal]], a battlefield of the [[Pacific War]], by the American Army in February 1943, his mother had to fully support the family vegetable industry. To help her in heavy works with her two older sisters, for seven years from the fifth grade, with a bicycle and a loaded back carriage, he brought fruit and vegetables to the [[Nagaoka, Niigata|Nagaoka]] market, 12 km away, early in the morning before going to school, which was held twice a week.

On the evening of August 14, 1945, at the end of [[World War II]], when he entered [[elementary school]], Nagaoka was attacked by the incendiary bombs of the great formation of US military aircraft B29. His family had built a temporary hut on a rice field, about 500 m away from home, and took refuge when the alarm sounded. The next day, where the morning market was held, it became a burning field.

His father died in November 1968, at age 80. In December, after fighting with [[Gene Kiniski]], he returned to his hometown to visit his tomb. His mother died three years later, in July 1971, at age 75.

== Professional baseball career ==
[[File:Shohei Baba (Giant Baba) 1955 Scan10041.jpg|thumb|upright|Baba in 1955]]
Before entering professional wrestling he had been a professional [[baseball]] [[pitcher]] for the [[Yomiuri Giants]], and was signed at the age of 17. Baba, who was issued jersey number 59, was a member of the organization for at least five years. It appears however, he spent most of his time in the minor leagues. He appeared in only three games with the Giants, and recorded a record of 0–1.

It was around this time when national wrestling hero and owner of the [[Japanese Wrestling Association]] (JWA) Mitsuhiro Momota – better known as [[Rikidōzan]] – began to feel the time was right for him to start grooming a successor in order to keep business strong.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Japan Wrestling Association (1960–1972) ===
In April 1960, Baba began training in Rikidōzan's dojo along with fellow student [[Kanji Inoki]]. The two trained together under Rikidōzan and made their debuts on September 30, 1960 at the old Daito Ku Gymnasium in Tokyo where Baba beat Yonetaro Tanaka and Inoki, renamed Antonio, lost to fellow Rikidōzan student [[Kintaro Ohki]].

Baba wrestled for [[Vincent J. McMahon]] in the United States in the early 1960s, unsuccessfully challenging [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavywight Champion]] [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] for the world title, and returning to face [[Bruno Sammartino]] for the [[WWE World Championship|WWWF World Heavyweight Championship]] in 1963 in [[Madison Square Garden]], where Sammartino defeated Baba.

The period 1967–1971 is best remembered by Japanese wrestling fans for the Baba and Inoki [[tag team]] that first won the NWA International Tag Team Championship on October 31, 1967 beating [[Bill Watts]] and [[Tarzan Tyler]], and would go on to hold the championship four times, a record that Baba would break later with another tag team partner, [[Jumbo Tsuruta]].

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling ===

==== Main event status (1972–1984) ====
In October 1972, with JWA on the decline and several months after Inoki had formed [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW), Baba formed his own promotion, [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), with the backing of [[Nippon TV]]. All Japan eventually took over the JWA's spot in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) after its collapse, and under Baba's strong business acumen, the rest of the NWA's talent enjoyed an amazing run in Japan.

Baba became the first Japanese wrestler ever to hold the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, defeating [[Jack Brisco]] in a two out of three falls match on December 2, 1974 in Kagoshima, Japan. He would hold the championship on two more occasions, but his reigns were short and limited to Japanese territory. Baba was additionally the first former NWA World Champion to be defeated by [[Ric Flair]], as Flair was becoming a top contender to the title.

==== Phasing out (1984–1994) ====
By 1984, Baba began phasing himself out to give rise to the next generation of wrestlers, led by [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] and [[Genichiro Tenryu]]. He voluntarily became a "curtain jerker", as he moved slowly and won only against mid-card talent. Under his leadership, All Japan Pro Wrestling became arguably the number one wrestling company in the world during the 1990s from a match quality standpoint. Following the formation of the quickly doomed [[Super World of Sports]], established talent such as Tenryu, [[Ashura Hara]] and [[Great Kabuki]] left All Japan and Baba was forced to push younger talent, such as [[Toshiaki Kawada]], [[Kenta Kobashi]], [[Akira Taue]] and [[Tsuyoshi Kikuchi]] up the card to replace them.

The biggest move Baba made at this time was taking the mask off Tiger Mask II and giving [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] the push as the biggest new singles star by pinning Jumbo Tsuruta in one of the most emotional matches in company history on June 8, 1990 at [[Budokan Hall]]. The show was close to a sellout and Misawa was immediately catapulted to main event status because of his victory over the legend Jumbo. Budokan Hall became a hotbed for professional wrestling with a string of sellouts in the building lasting for several years, which validated Baba's insistence on clean finishes in matches (Baba's response to the popularity of [[shoot wrestling]] at the time; before that, major matches often ended with double countout finishes).

With the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]] as the focal point, All Japan sold out more than 250 consecutive shows in Tokyo throughout the early to mid-1990s, routinely drawing houses in the $1,000,000 range eight times a year at Budokan Hall. At the peak of the company, tickets for the next Budokan show would be sold at the live event and completely sell out that night. In 1998, Baba finally agreed to run the Tokyo Dome on May 1, and despite it being a few years since the company peaked they still drew 58,300 paying fans. It became well known that as a promoter a hand shake agreement was often used rather than a signed contract, as he had a great reputation for keeping his word when it came to match finishes and payrolls. Because of this, many regarded Baba as the most honest promoter in the professional wrestling business.

==== Final years and death (1994–1999) ====
Baba's last "comeback" was during the [[World's Strongest Tag Determination League]] in 1994, when he teamed with old rival [[Stan Hansen]] in hopes of winning the [[World Tag Team Championship (AJPW)|World Tag Team Championship]]. The duo made it to the finals, but were defeated by Mitsuharu Misawa and [[Kenta Kobashi]]. His final match, prior to being confined to a hospital bed, occurred on December 5, 1998 at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, where he teamed with [[Rusher Kimura]] and [[Mitsuo Momota]] to take on [[Masanobu Fuchi]], [[Haruka Eigen]], and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresu.com/personalities/baba/results/baba_results1998.html|title=Giant Baba - Match Results: 1998|publisher=puroresu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 1999, Baba saw his last wrestling match, as Toshiaki Kawada defeated Mitsuharu Misawa for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. Nine days later, Baba died of [[cancer]].

== Private life ==
On September 16, 1971, after the death of his mother, in [[Hawaii]] he married Motoko Kawai (born January 2, 1940), but they had no children due to the fear of the children having gigantism. She passed away on April 14, 2018 from cirrhosis of the liver; she was 78 years old.&lt;ref name="f4wonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.f4wonline.com/japan/former-ajpw-owner-motoko-baba-passes-away-78-256306|title=Former AJPW Owner Motoko Baba Passes Away At 78|website=www.f4wonline.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Another Japanese professional wrestler, [[Hiroshi Nagao]] from [[Hustle (professional wrestling)|HUSTLE]], takes his ring name ("Giant Vabo") from Giant Baba (and Volleyball, his weapon). He once used Baba's theme music and ring attire for a tag team match (his opponent Koinoki imitated legendary Japanese professional wrestler [[Antonio Inoki]]).

''[[The Top 100 Historical Persons in Japan|The 2006 Top 100 Historical Persons in Japan]]'' survey ranked Baba the 92nd greatest person in the history of [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Japan Probe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanprobe.com/2006/05/08/japanese-rank-their-favorite-100-historical-figures/|title=Japanese rank their favorite 100 historical figures|accessdate=July 6, 2016|publisher=Japan Probe|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415014304/http://www.japanprobe.com/2006/05/08/japanese-rank-their-favorite-100-historical-figures/|archivedate=April 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Good Curry Guide''}}
The '''''Good Curry Guide '''''is a regularly published guide (book) providing information about the UK’s top [[curry]] [[restaurants]]. The ''Good Curry Guide'' was first published in 1984, by [[Pat Chapman]], founder of [[The Curry Club]] and is the only such publication currently in print.  From 1991 to date [[Cobra Beer]] have been the Guide's sole sponsor.

==Overview==

The ''Good Curry Guide'' currently reports on over 1,000 top curry establishments. It is unique as it is completely rewritten every edition and is entirely independent — though there is advertising and sponsorship, no fees are accepted for inclusion, and all of the inspections are anonymous.

Readers are actively encouraged to submit their reviews, via the [http://www.patchapman.co.uk/cobra-good-curry-guide/ Good Curry Guide website]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, or by post which are then considered for prospective inclusion in the next guide.  Opinions are always honest, often critical, and all contributors are listed in the Guide.

The address, phone and website details of each restaurant are listed and each is assessed for price, style and quality of food, service, the availability of dishes for vegetarians, whether the restaurant has a Bring Your Own (alcoholic drinks) policy, takeaway information, home delivery service, and more.

==Background==

In 1908 the [[The Automobile Association|Automobile Association]] (the AA) published its first Members' Handbook (listing the addresses of car mechanics around Britain). From 1912 the AA began inspecting hotels and restaurants, issuing the coveted AA Star to those deemed to be of sufficient quality.

[[Raymond Postgate]] first published his [[Good Food Guide]] in 1951  because he was appalled by the standard of contemporary UK catering. He recruited an army of volunteers clandestinely to visit and assess restaurants, and the notion of voluntary, unpaid reports from the public was copied by the Good Curry Guide.

The above Guides and others including the [[Michelin Guide]], whilst definitive on restaurants in general, have only carried around one to two percent entries on restaurants in the Indian sector.

==Restaurant Awards==
The Good [[Curry Awards]] have been given to the top UK curry restaurants by The Good Curry Guide since 1991 to reward excellence in the sector.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3621">The '''Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile''' ('''GOSIP''') was a specification that profiled open networking products for procurement by governments in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

* 1990 - The US specification requiring [[Open Systems Interconnection]] (OSI) protocols was first published as [[Federal Information Processing Standards]] document FIPS 146-1.  The requirement for US Government vendors to demonstrate their support for this profile led them to join the formal [[interoperability testing|interoperability]] and [[conformance testing]] for networking products, which had been done by industry professionals at the annual InterOp show since 1980.
* 1990 - Publication of European Procurement Handbook (EPHOS), intended to be a European GOSIP&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Caffrey | first1 = L. | title = EPHOS: Towards a European GOSIP | doi = 10.1016/0169-7552(90)90083-5 | journal = Computer Networks and ISDN Systems | volume = 19 | issue = 3–5 | pages = 265–284 | year = 1990 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1993 - Australia and New Zealand GOSIP Version 3 - 1993 Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standards.govt.nz/web-shop/?action=viewSearchProduct&amp;mod=catalog&amp;pid=55.4%3A1993%28SAA%7CSNZ+HB%29&amp;searchId=1162982&amp;searchOrderingIndex=1&amp;searchSessionId=ACC3F050EF7DEDCA6C19B718C835F2B6 "ANZ GOSIP Version 3 - 1993"], standards.govt.nz&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1995 - FIPS 146-2 allowed "...other specifications based on open, voluntary standards such as those cited in paragraph 3 ("...such as those developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)... and the International Telecommunications Union, Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU–T))"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-1995-05-15/95-11917 "60 FR 25888 - APPROVAL OF FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS PUBLICATIONS (FIPS) 146-2, PROFILES FOR OPEN SYSTEMS INTERNETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES, AND 179-1, GOVERNMENT NETWORK MANAGEMENT PROFILE"], gpo.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, from 1995 interest in OSI implementations declined, and worldwide the deployment of standards-based networking services since have been predominantly based on the Internet protocol suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= OSI: The Internet That Wasn’t |work= Spectrum |publisher= IEEE |author= Andrew L. Russell |date= 29 July 2013 |url= http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/osi-the-internet-that-wasnt |accessdate= 30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[Defense Messaging System]] continued to be based on the OSI protocols [[X.400]] and [[X.500]], due to their integrated security capabilities.

'''''High Weirdness By Mail – A Directory of the Fringe: Crackpots, Kooks &amp; True Visionaries''''', by [[Ivan Stang]] ({{ISBN|0-671-64260-X}}) is a 1988 book dedicated to an examination of "weird culture" by actually putting the reader in touch with it by mail.

The book is divided into sections&amp;mdash;"Weird Science," "UFO Contactees," "Drug Stuff," and others, and each section contains a variety of mini-articles describing organizations. Each organization article concludes with a mailing address (and in some cases, phone numbers).

Several years after the book's publication, Stang reported on the [[newsgroup]] [[alt.slack]] that his inclusion of entries for [[white supremacist]] groups in the book caused his name to be mentioned by those groups as a possible target for retaliation.  (The book's commentaries on various [[hate group]]s were less than flattering.)  Stang reported this incident to the [[FBI]], but did not receive any actual harassment or threats from the groups in question.

The [[Association for Consciousness Exploration]] produced a follow-up lecture by Rev. Stang on cassette entitled ''High Weirdness by Mail'', recorded live at the 1993 WinterStar Symposium.

== Controversy ==

[[Bob Black]] claims that his review of ''High Weirdness By Mail'' was the cause of his being sent a small 'prank' mail bomb. [http://www.inspiracy.com/black/bomb.html]

The '''''Historia belli sacri''''' (History of the Holy War) is a chronicle of the [[First Crusade]] written by an anonymous monk of the [[Abbey of Montecassino]]. It was composed some time after 1131,&lt;ref&gt;Or "towards the year 1130", as in John France, "The Use of the Anonymous ''Gesta Francorum'' in the Early Twelfth-Century Sources for the First Crusade," in Alan V. Murray, ed., ''From Clermont to Jerusalem: The Crusades and Crusader Societies, 1095–1500'' (Turnhout: Brepols, 1998), 29–42.&lt;/ref&gt; based in large part on the equally anonymous ''[[Gesta Francorum et aliorum Hierosolimitanorum]]'' and also incorporating fragments from the ''[[Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem]]'', the ''[[Gesta Tancredi]]'' and other unknown texts.&lt;ref name=france&gt;John France, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bec_0373-6237_1968_num_126_2_449801 "Note sur le manuscrit 6041 A du fonds latin de la Bibliothèque nationale: un nouveau fragment d'un manuscrit de l&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Historia Belli Sacri''"], ''Bibliothèque de l'école des chartes'' '''126''':2 (1968), 413–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Although heavily reliant on the ''Gesta Francorum'', it is an important source for the [[Italo-Norman]] crusaders.&lt;ref&gt;John France, ''Victory in the East: A Military History of the First Crusade'' (Cambridge: 1994), 379; see also pp. 163, 166, 244–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the history of [[Robert the Monk]] and [[Guibert of Nogent]]'s ''[[Dei gesta per Francos]]'', both of which were used as sources by its anonymous author, the ''Historia belli sacri'' is "a serious and careful effort to rework the ''Gesta'' story and add to it significant information which is not found in any other source."&lt;ref name="France1998, 37"&gt;France (1998), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It was, after all, "written in an age when there were still survivors of the First Crusade."&lt;ref name="France1998, 38"&gt;France (1998), 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
For a long time the only known manuscript of the ''Historia belli sacri'' was to be found in the library of Montecassino. It was first edited by [[Jean Mabillon]] for his ''Museum Italicum'' (Paris, 1687), and this edition was re-published in the ''[[Recueil des Historiens des Croisades]]'' under the title '''''Tudebodus imitatus et continuatus'''''. It was regarded by the editors as an "imitation" and "continuation", along with the ''Gesta Francorum'', of [[Petrus Tudebodus]]' ''Historia de Hierosolymitano itinere''.&lt;ref name=france/&gt; A second fragment of the ''Historia belli sacri'' was discovered in Latin manuscript 6041 A of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. This fourteenth-century Italian manuscript once belonged to [[François Roger de Gaignières]]. The catalogue of the Bibliothèque's Latin section, published in 1774, lists the third document of MS 6041 A as " a history of Jerusalem by Pons of Baladun and Raymond, canon of Le Puy" (''Pontii de Baladuno et Raimundi, canonici Podiensis, Historia Hierosolymitana''). The actual third document in the MS is not only a copy of the ''Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem'', usually attributed to [[Pons of Baladun]] and [[Raymond of Aguilers]], but rather a compilation, by an unknown editor, of portions of three distinct works: the ''Historia Francorum'' (for the period up to the [[siege of Antioch]]), the ''Historia belli sacri'' (for the period from there to the conquest of [[Ramla]]) and the ''Gesta Francorum'' (for the period from Ramleh to the [[battle of Ascalon]]).&lt;ref name=france/&gt;

==Contents==
The ''Historia belli''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s section begins with this account of the crusaders' arrival at Antioch:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
On the next day, they came as far as Antioch, at midday, on the fourth day of the week, which is the twelfth kalends of November [21 October], and miraculously we besieged the gates of the city.
{{col-break}}
''Crastina autem die, pervenerunt usque ad Antiochiam, ad medietatem diei, in quarta feria, quod est duodecimo kalendas Novembris, et obsedimus mirabiliter portas civitatis.''&lt;ref name=france/&gt;
{{col-end}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Of the contemporary histories of the First Crusade, the ''Historia belli sacri'' provides the most information on the negotiations between the Crusaders and the [[Fatimid Caliphate]].&lt;ref name="France1998, 37"/&gt; The ''Historia'' is also the only source to go into detail concerning [[Bohemond of Taranto]]'s exceptionally long journey through the Balkans to Constantinople, which took six months with a comparatively small army, and after which he lodged in the suburb of Sancti Argenti for some time.&lt;ref name="France1998, 38"/&gt; It also records how at the beginning of the [[siege of Antioch]], the local governor, [[Yaghi-Siyan]], expelled the Christians from the city, and how a certain Hilary, a Muslim convert to Christianity, betrayed the Crusaders by divulging their weaknesses to the relieving army of [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan|Radwan of Aleppo]], only to be killed when the army was driven off.&lt;ref name="France1998, 38"/&gt;

Several of the ''Historia''′s accounts are more fanciful. It places all the leaders of the Crusade at the [[Council of Clermont]], although they were certainly not all there. It also has them begging [[Pope Urban II]] to lead them personally. It says that at the siege of Antioch a miraculous image of Christ that could not be pierced by Turkish arrows appeared in the cathedral. More credibly, it says that after the siege, the Christian women of the city went to release the imprisoned [[Patriarch of Antioch]], [[John the Oxite|John VII]], only to find that he could not stand, his legs having been weakened by so long a confinement.&lt;ref name="France1998, 38"/&gt;

'''Holloway v Attorney-General''' [1994] 2 ERNZ 528 is a case frequently cited in New Zealand regarding [[unilateral contract]]s.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |pages=276–277, 283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Until the late 1980s, in an effort to reduce a shortage of school teachers in New Zealand, the [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]] stated that people who completed a teachers course at university, upon graduation, would be employed for 2 years as a teacher by the ministry.

However, with declining numbers of students, and a substantial budget deficit, the government ceased this guarantee of employment, and when Ms Hollaway graduated as a teacher she was not offered the promised employment.

Not happy with this, Holloway sued the Ministry of Education in the Employment Court.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal ruled that the Ministry of Education's statements of "''will be appointed [as a teacher]"'' was a unilateral contract, thus there was a legally binding obligation to employ Ms Holloway.

'''Footnote:''' Although Holloway won the battle of whether there was a legally binding employment contract, she at the same time lost the war, as the Court of Appeal ruled that the Employment Court had no jurisdiction to hear such a case in the first place, leaving Holloway having to refile her claim via the District Court instead.

The '''''Ilford Manual of Photography''''' is a comprehensive manual of [[photography]], first published in 1890, written by C.H. Bothamley, and published by the Britannia Works Company, which became Ilford, Limited, in 1901. It is still in print, now named '''''The Manual of Photography'''''.

Technical information regarding optics, chemistry and printing are described in far greater depth than in other photographic books, and therefore it quickly became the staple technical book for the professional or serious amateur photographer. It remained so for some time, and with each additional edition further information was added so that it might remain relevant. It still lines the bookshelves of many serious photographers, consequent to its tremendous depth, and the publication of many of the recipes for developers, including the popular ID-11 and IF-2, [[Ilford Photo]]'s then non-hardening fixer. This represents a tremendous boon for the photographer, and did even more so in the early 20th century, when many would mix their own chemistry. It is comparable in many ways to [[Ansel Adams]]' books ''The Camera, The Negative'' and ''The Print,'' in its logical description of exposing film (and plates), developing the negative, and printing from those negatives.

The '''Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan''' (IRP or IRPT; {{lang-tg|Ҳизби Наҳзати Исломии Тоҷикистон}} ''Hizbi Nahzati Islomii Tojikiston'', {{lang-fa|حزب نهضت اسلامی تاجیکستان}}; also known as the '''Islamic Renaissance of Tajikistan''', the '''Islamic Revival Party of Tajikistan''', the '''Islamic Party of Revival''', or simply the '''Islamic Renaissance Party''') is a banned [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[political party]] in [[Tajikistan]]. Until 2015, it was the only legal Islamist party in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Mountain Rigger |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8148621 |magazine=[[The Economist]] |date=November 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was founded in 1990. In 1992, the party hosted a conference in [[Saratov]], [[Russia]], attended by Islamists from ex-Soviet central Asia, [[Tatarstan]] and [[Bashkortostan]]. When Tajikistan became independent, it was banned in 1993. It fought with the [[United Tajik Opposition]] and the [[Garmi people]] against the government during the [[Civil War in Tajikistan|Tajik Civil War]] but was legalised following peace accords in 1998. In 1999 it was the second largest party in Tajikistan.

The IRP's long-running leader, [[Said Abdullo Nuri]], died in August 2006 of [[cancer]]. The party boycotted the [[Tajik presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential election]].

At the [[legislative]] [[elections in Tajikistan|elections]] held 27 February and 13 March 2005 the party won 8% of the popular vote and 2 out of 63 seats.

At the [[Tajikistani parliamentary election, 2015|elections]] held on 1 March 2015 the Party failed to surpass the 5% vote barrier, losing its only 2 seats in Parliament.

After a ban in 2015, Tajikistan designated the party as a [[terrorist organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Casey|last=Michel|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/11/trouble-tajikistan-151104085616528.html|title=Trouble in Tajikistan: Analysts say the banning of a moderate Islamist party could unravel the country's post-civil war order|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=5 November 2015|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/tajikistan-human-rights-fears-banned-irpt-party-leaders-jailed-life|title=Tajikistan human rights fears as banned party's ex-leaders jailed for life|publisher=The Guardian|agency=Reuters|date=2 June 2016|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 15 August 2018 Washington Post story, regional expert Paul Stronski, a Senior Fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], said a 31 July 2018 [[Terrorist attack against cyclists in Tajikistan|attack on seven Western cyclists in Tajikistan]] is being blamed on members of the party even though ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/were-the-american-cyclists-killed-in-tajikistan-naive-for-traveling-there/2018/08/14/f8212ca8-9b36-11e8-b60b-1c897f17e185_story.html|title=Were the American cyclists killed in Tajikistan naive for traveling there?|work=Washington Post|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other news reports noted that the five attackers appeared in a video released by ISIS after the attack pledging allegiance to the group and its leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/washington-dc-couple-american-cyclists-tajikistan-isis-lauren-geoghegan-jay-austin/|title=D.C. couple killed in ISIS-claimed attack were cycling around world|work=CBS News|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of state pressure==

In April 2014, the party denounced official harassment and alleged government attempts to undermine their credibility and electoral chances, as parliamentary elections were scheduled in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iwpr.net/global-voices/tajikistans-islamic-opposition-under-pressure|title=Tajikistan's Islamic Opposition Under Pressure|work=Institute for War and Peace Reporting|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the runup to the 1 March 2015 legislative elections, a wide-ranging government-induced campaign, to demonize the party and bar its candidates from entering the contest, was reported.{{by whom|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref name="Eurasianet2015_1"&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/node/72291 Tajikistan’s Feeble Opposition Attacked Relentlessly Ahead of Weekend Vote] - Edward Lemon, EurasiaNet, 26 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2015, the government of Tajikistan demanded the party halt its "illegal activities" as it attempted to hold a party congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Borisov |first=Akbar |date=28 August 2015|title=Tajikistan's Islamic opposition party faces ban amid crackdown |url=https://news.yahoo.com/tajikistans-islamic-opposition-party-faces-ban-amid-crackdown-183932617.html |work=Yahoo News |agency=AFP |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party claimed that the government was attempting to close it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/qishloq-ovozi-demise-of-tajik-islamic-party/27227509.html|title=The Demise Of Tajikistan's Islamic Party|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jan Długosz''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈjan ˈdwuɡɔʂ}}; 1 December 1415&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 19 May 1480), also known as '''Ioannes''', '''Joannes''', or '''Johannes Longinus''' or '''Dlugossius''', was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]], [[chronicler]], [[diplomat]], [[soldier]], and secretary to Bishop [[Zbigniew Oleśnicki (cardinal)|Zbigniew Oleśnicki]] of [[Kraków]]. He is considered Poland's first historian.{{sfn|Davies|1982|p=5}}

==Life==
[[File:Jan Długosz 1.PNG|thumb|left|Jan Długosz]]
Jan Długosz is best known for his ''[[Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae]]'' (''Annals or Chronicles of the Famous Kingdom of Poland''), covering events in southeastern Europe, but also in Western Europe, from 965 to 1480, the year he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05069b.htm|title=Jan Dlugosz|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was first printed in 1701-1703. Whenever he bothers to mention himself in the book, he writes of himself in the [[Grammatical person|third person]]. He belonged to the [[Wieniawa Coat of Arms|Wieniawa]] [[Polish heraldry|coat-of-arms]].

Długosz was a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] at [[Kraków]],{{sfn|Davies|1982|p=5}} educated in the [[University of Krakow]].  He was sent by King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] of Poland on diplomatic missions to the [[Pope|Papal]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial]] courts, and was involved in the King's negotiations with the [[Teutonic Knights]] during the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]] (1454–66) and at the peace negotiations.

In 1434, Długosz's uncle, the first pastor at [[Kłobuck]], appointed him to take over his position as canon of St. Martin church there. The town was in the [[Opole]] territory of [[Silesia]], but had recently been conquered by [[Jogaila|Władysław II Jagiełło]]. Długosz stayed until 1452 and while there, founded the canonical monastery.

In 1450, Długosz was sent by Queen [[Sophia of Halshany]] and King Casimir to conduct peace negotiations between [[John Hunyadi]] and the [[Bohemia]]n noble [[Jan Jiskra of Brandýs]], and after six days' of talks convinced them to sign a truce.

In 1455 in [[Kraków]], a fire spread which destroyed much of the city and the castle, but which spared Długosz's house.

In 1461 a Polish delegation which included Długosz met with emissaries of [[George of Podebrady]] in [[Bytom]], [[Silesia]]. After six days of talks, they concluded an alliance between the two factions. In 1466 Długosz was sent to the legate of [[Wrocław]], in order to attempt to obtain assurance that the legate was not biased in favor of the [[Teutonic Knights]]. He was successful, and was in 1467 entrusted with tutoring the king's son.

Długosz declined the offer of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Prague|Archbishopric of Prague]], but shortly before his death was nominated [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Archbishop of Lwów]].  This nomination was only confirmed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]] on 2 June 1480,&lt;ref&gt;[[Konrad Eubel]] (1914). ''Hierarchia catholica medii aevi'', Münster: Librariae Regensbergianae, vol. 2, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; two weeks after his death.

His work ''Banderia Prutenorum'' of 1448 is his description of the 1410 [[Battle of Grunwald]], which took place between villages of [[Grunwald, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Grunwald]] and [[Stębark]].

At some point in his life Długosz loosely translated [[Wigand of Marburg]]'s ''[[Chronica nova Prutenica]]'' from [[Middle High German]] into [[Latin]], however with many mistakes and mixup of names and places.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8H8OAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA676&amp;dq=Memel+fluss+historie#PPA431,M1 Samples of Jan Dlugosz mistakes and mixups on Pages 431-434] in Scriptorum Rerum Prussicarum&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jane's Fighting Ships''''' is an annual [[reference book]] (also published online, on [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[microfiche]]) of information on all the world's [[warship]]s arranged by nation, including information on ship's names, dimensions, armaments, [[silhouette]]s and [[photograph]]s, etc. Its annual editions cover the warships used by the different national naval and paramilitary forces, and provide data on their characteristics.

It was originally published by [[Fred T. Jane|John F. T. Jane]] (usually known as "Fred T.") in London in 1898 as ''Jane's All the World's Fighting Ships'', in order to assist the public in playing [[Wargaming|naval wargames]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj00/fal00/caffrey.htm |title=Toward a History Based Doctrine for Wargaming |first=Matthew |last=Caffrey Jr. |journal=[[Air and Space Power Journal|Aerospace Power Journal]] |issue=Fall 2000 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success launched a number of military publications carrying the name "Jane's". It is a unit of [[Jane's Information Group]], which is now owned by [[IHS Inc.|IHS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.ihs.com/press-release/corporate/ihs-acquires-janes-information-group |title=IHS Acquires Jane’s Information Group |work=IHS Online Newsroom |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Cândido de Melo Carvalho''' (June 11, 1914—October 22, 1994) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[zoologist]] who specialized in [[entomology]] and was a world authority on the true bugs or [[Hemiptera]]. He was director of the [[Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi]] (1955-1960), in [[Belém]], and of the [[Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro]]. His abilities both in science and in the field of politics helped Brazil to develop and maintain a high level of [[systematic biology]].

Carvalho published more than 500 papers on the taxonomy of the [[Miridae]], as well as studies of other insect groups. Between 1957 and 1960 his catalog of the Miridae of the world was published by the National Museum, totaling more than 1,100 pages.

He coordenated the edition of "Atlas da Fauna Brasileira", a book on Brazilian animals.

In addition, he published on the knowledge of animals by Indians of the [[Xingu River]] basin, and on the explorations of early naturalists in the Amazon.

He was a member of the Vatican Academy of Sciences, and Vice-President of the Brazilian National Research Council.

He participated in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, at which time he became friends with future Brazilian president Castelo Branco.

[[Image:Badianus.jpg|thumb|right|A page of the ''Libellus'' illustrating the ''tlahçolteoçacatl, tlayapaloni, axocotl'' and ''chicomacatl'' plants, used to make a remedy for ''lęsum &amp; male tractatum corpus'', "injured and badly treated body"]]

The '''''Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis''''' ([[Latin]] for "Little Book of the Medicinal Herbs of the Indians") is an [[Aztec]] herbal [[manuscript]], describing the [[herbalism|medicinal properties]] of various plants used by the Aztecs. It was translated into Latin by [[Juan Badiano]], from a [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] original composed in the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]] in 1552 by Martín de la Cruz that is no longer extant. The ''Libellus'' is also known as the '''Badianus Manuscript''', after the translator; the '''Codex de la Cruz-Badiano''', after both the original author and translator; and the '''Codex Barberini''', after [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Francesco Barberini (seniore)|Francesco Barberini]], who had possession of the manuscript in the early 17th century.

The Badianus Manuscript of 1552 is the first illustrated and descriptive scientific text of [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] medicine and botany produced in the Americas. The original text was produced in [[Nahuatl]] and translated to Latin for European readers. It is a significant text in the [[history of botany]] and the [[history of medicine]].

==History==
In 1552 Jacobo de Grado, the [[friar]] in charge of the Convent of Tlatelolco and the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco|College of Santa Cruz]], had the herbal created and translated for Don Francisco de Mendoza, son of Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]], the [[viceroy]] of [[New Spain]]. Mendoza sent the Latin manuscript to Spain, where it was deposited into the royal library. There it presumably remained until the early 17th century, when it somehow came into the possession of Diego de Cortavila y Sanabria, [[pharmacy|pharmacist]] to [[Philip IV of Spain|King Philip IV]]. From Cortavila it travelled to the Italian Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (seniore)|Francesco Barberini]], possibly via intermediate owners. The manuscript remained in the [[Barberini]] library until 1902, when the Barberini library became part of the [[Vatican Library]], and the manuscript along with it. Finally, in 1990 — over four centuries after it was sent to Spain — [[Pope John Paul II]] returned the ''Libellus'' to Mexico, and it is now in the library of the [[National Institute of Anthropology and History]] in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="Byland"&gt;Bruce Byland, "Introduction," ''An Aztec Herbal: The Classic Codex of 1552,'' Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|iii}}

A copy was made in the 17th century by [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], the secretary of Cardinal Barberini. Dal Pozzo's collection, called his ''Museo Cartaceo'' ("Papers Museum"), was sold by his heirs to [[Pope Clement XI]], who sold it to his nephew, Cardinal [[Alessandro Albani]], who himself sold it to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] in 1762. Dal Pozzo's copy is now part of the [[Royal Library, Windsor]]. Another copy may have been made by Francesco de' Stelluti, but is now lost. Dal Pozzo and de' Stelluti were both members of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].

There are several published editions of the manuscript, beginning with the one by [[William E. Gates]] in 1939, now reissued in an inexpensive edition by Dover Books.&lt;ref&gt;William Gates, ''The de la Cruz-Badiano Aztec Herbal of 1552.'' Baltimore: The Maya Society, Publication No. 22, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; Gates acquired photographs of the manuscript in Latin and water color renderings of the botanical drawings. He published both the original Latin manuscript as well as his translation to English. The reissued edition of Gates's manuscript has a very useful introduction by Bruce Byland, recounting the publication history of the manuscript and subsequent scholarship.&lt;ref name="Byland"/&gt;{{rp|iii–xiii}}

At the same time Gates was working on this publication, another was being prepared for publication by Emily Walcott Emmart.  This resulted in a full-color facsimile publication, transcription, and translation to English, with notes and commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Walcott Emmart, ''The Badianus Manuscript (Codex Barberini Latin 241): An Aztec Herbal of 1552''.  Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1964, an edition of the manuscript was published in full-color facsimile, with a translation of the Latin to Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Martín de la Cruz, ''Libellus de medicinalibus  indorum herbis: Manuscrito Azteca de 1552: versión española con estudios y comentarios por diversos autores''. Mexico: Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript has been mainly studied by scholars interested in [[history of medicine]] and [[history of botany]]. In history of medicine, there has been some focus on the extent to which the manuscript might be incorporating aspects of European humoral theories of medicine or whether text is purely from the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Hassig, "Transplanted medicine: Colonial Mexican Herbals of the sixteenth century." RES: The journal of anthropology and aesthetics 17/18. Spring/Autumn 1989, pp. 30-53.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by Bernard R. Ortiz de Montellano, the Badianus herbal was prepared for the king of Spain to demonstrate the intellectual sophistication of the Nahuas which might have skewed the manuscript to emulating aspects of European culture.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Ortiz de Montellano, ''Aztec Medicine, health, and nutrition,'' New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The botanical aspects of the manuscript are significant, showing that the Nahuas had a classification system that was indeed highly sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Faustino Miranda and Javier Valdés, "Comentarios botánicos," in ''Libellus de Medicnialibus Indorum'' by Martin de la Cruz. Mexico, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, 1964, pp. 243-284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blas P. Reko, "Nombres botaánicos del Manuscrito Badiano," Sociedad Botánico de México, Vol. V: 23-43.&lt;/ref&gt; As with Book 11, "The Earthly Things" of the [[Florentine Codex]] by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], the Badianus manuscript gives the Nahuatl names of plants, an illustration of the example, and the uses for the plant. However, unlike the Florentine Codex, there is little emphasis on supernatural healing characteristics of the plants. The examples in the Badinus manuscript deal solely with the medical conditions and curative aspects of the plants. For example, in the Gates translation, subject headings for plants' curative powers include "Against stupidity of the mind," [against] "Goaty armpits of sick people," "Against lassitude," "Medicine to take away foul and fetid breath."&lt;ref name="Gates"&gt;William Gates, ''An Aztec Herbal: The Classic Codex of 1552.'' Mineola, NY: Dover Books 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  For scholars interested in gendered medical conditions, the Badinus manuscript has a whole chapter on "remedies for recent parturition, the menses, lotion of the internal parts, childbirth, tubercules of the breasts, [and] medicine for increasing milk flow."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;{{rp|105}} Various plants listed in the Badinus manuscript have psychoactive properties, examined by anthropologist Peter Furst.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Furst, "This Little Books of Herbs: Psychoactive planst as therapeutic agents in the Badianus Manuscript of 1552."

==Connection with the Voynich Manuscript==

In 2014, Arthur O. Tucker and Rexford H. Talbert published a paper claiming a positive identification of 37 plants, 6 animals, and 1 mineral referenced in the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Tucker | first1=Arthur O. | last2=Talbert | first2=Rexford H. | title=A Preliminary Analysis of the Botany, Zoology, and Mineralogy of the Voynich Manuscript | url=http://cms.herbalgram.org/herbalgram/issue100/hg100-feat-voynich.html?ts=1390369202&amp;signature=402e6a559a0e56b5343a6f4d002492fa | journal=HerbalGram | date=Winter 2013 | issue=100 | pages=70–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that these were from Colonial [[New Spain]] and represented the [[Nahuatl]] language, and date the manuscript to between 1521 (the date of the Conquest) to ca. 1576, in contradiction to radiocarbon dating evidence of the vellum, which dates it to ca. 1420, and many other elements of the manuscript. The analysis has been criticized by noted Voynich Manuscript researchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciphermysteries.com/2014/01/21/brand-new-new-world-nahuatl-voynich-manuscript-theory |title=A Brand New New World / Nahuatl Voynich Manuscript Theory… |last1=Pelling |first1=Nick |authorlink1= Nick Pelling |date=14 January 2014 |website=Cipher Mysteries |publisher= |accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that—among other things—a skilled forger could construct plants that have a passing resemblance to existing plants that were heretofore undiscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24987-mexican-plants-could-break-code-on-gibberish-manuscript.html |title=Mexican plants could break code on gibberish manuscript |last1=Grossman |first1=Lisa |date= February 3, 2014 |website=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Linguistic Diversity in Space and Time'''''&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hrT_xNaDkgQC&amp;printsec=frontcover Linguistic Diversity in Space and Time]''. [[University of Chicago Press]], 1992. {{ISBN|9780226580579}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1992 book by [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Johanna Nichols]]. It is her best known work, pioneering the use of [[linguistic typology]] as a tool for understanding [[human migrations]] in [[prehistory]].

Nichols selects a sample of the world's languages (one per [[language family|stock]]) and tabulates typological characteristics such as:
* [[Head-marking language|Head-marking]] vs. [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]]
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphological]] complexity
* [[Word order]]
* [[Morphosyntactic alignment]]
* [[Valency (linguistics)|Valence]]-changing operations or [[grammatical voice|voice]] system
* Presence or absence of distinction between [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive we]]
* Presence or absence of distinction between [[inalienable possession]] and [[alienable possession]]
* Presence or absence of [[numerical classifiers]]
* Presence or absence of [[noun class]]es (such as [[grammatical gender]] or [[animacy]])
* Presence or absence of [[grammatical number]] ("plurality neutralization" is Nichols's term for absence)
* Presence or absence of [[adpositional phrases]] ("PP's" in the book, for prepositional or postpositional phrases)
* Presence or absence of [[non-finite verb]]s ([[infinitive]]s or [[verbal noun]]s)
for each language, using this data to discover regional patterns in the distribution of these features.

One pattern is '''spread zones''' (geographical areas where a language family has spread widely, often repeated with several language families in sequence, like [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and later [[Turkic languages]] in central [[Eurasia]]) vs. '''residual zones''' (areas, often mountainous, where many languages of various families have been preserved, like the [[Caucasus]] or [[New Guinea]]). For example, head marking is more common in the residual zones, which Nichols suggests is a result of long-term language contact.

At the broadest level, Nichols divides the world of languages into three large regions:
*[[Old World]]
*[[New World]] ([[Indigenous languages of the Americas]])
*"'Pacific" ([[Australian languages]] and [[Papuan languages]])
The Old World is geographically largest, but has the least typological diversity and lowest density of language families, suggesting that repeated spreads from its center have eliminated much diversity which previously existed, especially at the edges of the [[Africa-Eurasia]] supercontinent. Surprisingly, typological statistics for [[African languages]] are similar to those for the languages of [[Eurasia]], though there has been little spread of languages between the two areas, other than the [[Afroasiatic languages]] that span both areas.

The New World differs considerably from the Old World, with much higher frequencies of head-marking, ergativity and other features. The "Pacific" is intermediate on these features. One interpretation is that these patterns resulted from chance; another is that the New World was colonized from a [[Pacific region]] which was formerly larger and included unknown archaic languages of coastal [[East Asia]]. Based on the latter interpretation, Nichols suggests a relatively early date (pre-[[Clovis culture|Clovis]]) for the initial [[peopling of the Americas]].

Nichols also suggests that change over time in head-marking languages tends to destroy the information needed for the [[comparative method]] of reconstructing a [[protolanguage]] that is the ancestor to a number of known languages, while dependent-marking languages are more likely to preserve it over time. This would help account for the large number of language families in the Americas and [[Australasia]] that are still considered independent, in contrast to the large families of considerable time depth that have been reconstructed in Eurasia and Africa.

On March 10, 2010 a mass crackdown was initiated to thwart a planned peaceful 'million march' to be conducted in a South Indian state capital of Hyderabad demanding formation of a new federal unit, more than 100,000 Telangana people were taken in to custody by a police force controlled by the coastal 'andhra' elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12699113|title=Mass arrests before India rally|date=2011-03-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass arrests of protesters in the United States===
In December 1964, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] was disrupted by a mass student [[sit-in]] in the administration building and by mass arrests of 700 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Nathan Glazer|publisher=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=2|number=12|date=Mar 25, 1967|pages=601–605|jstor=4357739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on May 3, 1971, three days into the [[1971 May Day Protests]] - a series of large-scale [[civil disobedience]] actions in [[Washington, D.C.]] - massive arrest sweeps begin. In a few days over 12,000 are arrested - the largest mass arrest in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=UPI1971&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title Page 5 "Vietnam Demonstrations: 1971 Year in Review, United Press International Accessed 2009-04-13.] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gYCuqxqS?url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/ |date=2009-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5gYCuqxqS?url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/ 1971 Year in Review Archived United Press International 2009-05-05].&lt;/ref&gt;

Former American President [[Jimmy Carter]] said in regards to the racial conflicts of the time, "I would be opposed to mass arrest, and I would be opposed to preventive detention.  But I think that the abuses in the past have in many cases exacerbated the disharmonies that brought about demonstrations, and I think that arrest or large numbers of people without warrants ... is a contrary to our best systems of justice."&lt;ref&gt;Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States, Jimmy Carter, 1977, Book 1: January 20 to June 24, 1977, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous mass arrest occurred on September 27, 2002, in [[Washington, DC]] in which several hundred anti-[[World Bank]]/[[International Monetary Fund]] protestors, journalists and bystanders were systematically arrested by police&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3965|title=Another Day, Another Mass Arrest|author=Rachel Coen|date=November–December 2002|publisher=Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1001-01.htm|date=October 1, 2002|publisher=Agence France Presse|title=Activists Decry Police Intimidation in Anti-Globalization Protests}}&lt;/ref&gt; and charged with [[failure to obey a police order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dcwatch.com/police/030125.htm |title=Final Report Relative to Complaints of Alleged Misconduct Made at the October 24, 2002, Hearing of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Council of the District of Columbia Concerning the IMF/World Bank Protest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006135953/http://dcwatch.com/police/030125.htm |archivedate=October 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[class action]] lawsuit against the government ensued.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pershingparksettlement.com/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pre-emptive mass arrest]]s have also sometimes been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-mass-arrests-have-no-place-in-a-democratic-country-1668276.html|title=Leading article: Mass arrests have no place in a democratic country|date=14 April 2009|publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 28, 2012, [[Law enforcement and the Occupy movement#Mass Arrest at Oakland - Jan 28|more than 400 people were arrested at Oakland]].

During a seven-day span on Capitol Hill, from April 11 through April 18, 2016 police arrested approximately 1,240 people (300 arrests were made on April 18 alone) who were demonstrating for reforms to how Americans vote and campaign in elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/276689-capitol-police-arrest-more-than-1000-protesters|title=Capitol Hill arrests in pro-democracy protest hit 1,240|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|date=2016-04-18|work=TheHill|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mass arrest as a war crime ==
Indiscriminate mass arrests were designated a [[war crime]] in 1944 by a Commission on war crimes created by the [[London International Assembly]].  This was one of two items added by that Commission to the list of war crimes that had been drawn up by the [[Commission of Responsibilities|Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties]] in 1919.  Specifically, "indiscriminate mass arrests for the purpose of terrorizing the population" were designated as war crimes by the Commission.&lt;ref name=Sunga1992 /&gt;

At the Netherlands temporary [[court martial]] in 1947, several members of the [[Tokubetsu Keisatsutai|tokkeitai]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] were accused of the war crime of indiscriminate mass arrests.  The applicable legislation, used by the court, was the NEI Statute Book Decree #44 of 1946, whose definition of war crimes paralleled the Commission's list.  Specifically, item #34 of the enumerated list of war crimes under the NEI legislation was "indiscriminate mass arrests for the purpose of terrorising the population, whether described as taking hostages or not".  The court understood the definition of such unlawful mass arrests to be as "arrests of groups of persons firstly on the ground of wild rumours and suppositions, and secondly without definite facts and indications being present with regard to each person which would justify his arrest".  To this it added commentary on indiscriminate mass arrests that are for the purpose of terrorizing the populace, stating that they "contained the elements of systematic terrorism for nobody, even the most innocent, was any longer certain of his liberty, and a person once arrested, even if absolutely innocent, could no longer be sure of health and life".&lt;ref name=UNWCC /&gt;

==Principles==
===A sound archive with synchronized transcriptions===
For the science of [[linguistics]], language is first and foremost spoken language. The medium of spoken language is sound. The Pangloss collection gives access to original recordings simultaneously with transcriptions and translations, as a resource for further research. After being recorded in its cultural context, texts have been transcribed in collaboration with [[native speakers]].

===A structured, open architecture===
The archived data is structured in accordance with the latest data-processing standards, as [[open architecture]], in an [[open format]], and may be downloaded under a [[Creative Commons license]]. The software used to prepare and disseminate it is [[open-source]]. The Pangloss collection is a member of the [[OLAC]] network of archival repositories.

[[Image:Pangu.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Pangu from ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'']]

'''Pangu''' ({{zh|t=盤古 |s=盘古 |p=Pángǔ |w=P'an-ku}}) is the first living being and the creator of all in some versions of [[Chinese mythology]].

==Legend==

The first writer to record the myth of Pangu was [[Xu Zheng (Eastern Wu)|Xu Zheng]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period. Recently his name was found in a tomb dated 194 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnr.cn/history/custom/201308/t20130802_513213171.shtml 盘古探源：让你了解古老神秘的盘古]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning, there was nothing in the universe except a formless chaos. This chaos coalesced into a [[world egg|cosmic egg]] for about 18,000 years. Within it, the perfectly opposed principles of [[Yin and Yang]] became balanced, and Pangu emerged (or woke up) from the egg. Pangu is usually depicted as a primitive, hairy [[giant]] who has horns on his head and wears fur. Pangu began creating the world: he separated Yin from Yang with a swing of his giant [[axe]], creating the Earth (murky ''Yin'') and the Sky (clear ''Yang''). To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. With each day, the [[sky]] grew ten feet (3 meters) higher, the Earth ten feet thicker, and Pangu ten feet taller. This task took yet another 18,000 years. In some versions of the story, Pangu is aided in this task by the four most prominent beasts, namely the [[Turtle]], the [[Qilin]], the [[Fenghuang|Phoenix]], and the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]].

After the 18,000 years had elapsed, Pangu died. His breath became the [[wind]], mist and [[cloud]]s; his voice, thunder; his left [[eye]], the [[sun]]; his right eye, the [[moon]]; his head, the [[mountain]]s and extremes of the world; his [[blood]], [[river]]s; his [[muscle]]s, fertile land; his facial hair, the [[star]]s and [[Milky Way]]; his [[fur]], bushes and [[forest]]s; his [[bone]]s, valuable [[mineral]]s; his bone marrow, sacred [[diamond]]s; his sweat, [[rain]]; and the [[flea]]s on his fur carried by the wind became [[animal]]s.

==Origin==
Three main views describe the origin of the Pangu myth. The first is that the story is indigenous and was developed or transmitted through time to [[Xu Zheng (Eastern Wu)|Xu Zheng]]. Senior Scholar Wei Juxian states that the Pangu story is derived from stories during the Western [[Zhou Dynasty]]. He cites the story of Zhong (重) and Li (黎) in the "Chuyu" section of the ancient classics [[Guoyu (book)|''Guoyu'']]. In it, King Zhao of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] asked Guanshefu (觀射父) a question: "What did the ancient classic "Zhou Shu" mean by the sentence that Zhong and Li caused the heaven and earth to disconnect from each other?" The "Zhou Shu" sentence he refers to is about an earlier person, Luu Xing, who converses with [[King Mu of Zhou]]. King Mu's reign is much earlier and dates to about 1001 to 946 BC. In their conversation, they discuss a "disconnection" between heaven and earth.

[[Derk Bodde]] linked the myth to the ancestral mythologies of the [[Miao people]] and [[Yao people]] in southern China.&lt;ref&gt;Derk Bodde, "Myths of Ancient China", in ''Mythologies of the Ancient World'', ed. by Samuel Noah Kramer, Anchor, 1961, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is Professor Qin's {{who?|date=December 2016}} reconstruction of the true creation myth preceding the myth of Pangu. Note that it is not actually a creation myth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A brother and his sister became the only survivors of the prehistoric Deluge by crouching in a gourd that floated on water. The two got married afterwards, and a mass of flesh in the shape of a whetstone was born. They chopped it and the pieces turned into large crowds of people, who began to reproduce again. The couple were named 'Pan' and 'Gou' in the Zhuang ethnic language, which stand for whetstone and gourd respectively.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul Carus writes this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
P'an-Ku: The basic idea of the yih philosophy was so convincing that it almost obliterated the Taoist cosmology of P'an-Ku who is said to have chiseled the world out of the rocks of eternity.  Though the legend is not held in high honor by the literati, it contains some features of interest which have not as yet been pointed out and deserve at least an incidental comment.

P'an-Ku is written in two ways:  one means in literal translations, "basin ancient", the other "basin solid".  Both are homophones, i.e., they are pronounced the same way; and the former may be preferred as the original and correct spelling.  Obviously the name means "aboriginal abyss," or in the terser German, Urgrund, and we have reason to believe it to be a translation of the Babylonian [[Tiamat]], "the Deep."

The Chinese legend tells us that P'an-Ku's bones changed to rocks; his flesh to earth; his marrow, teeth and nails to metals; his hair to herbs and trees; his veins to rivers; his breath to wind; and his four limbs became pillars marking the four corners of the world, — which is a Chinese version not only of the Norse myth of the Giant Ymir, but also of the Babylonian story of Tiamat.

Illustrations of P'an-Ku represent him in the company of supernatural animals that symbolize old age or immortality, viz., the tortoise and the crane; sometimes also the dragon, the emblem of power, and the phoenix, the emblem of bliss.

When the earth had thus been shaped from the body of P'an-Ku, we are told that three great rivers successively governed the world:  first the celestial, then the terrestrial, and finally the human sovereign.  They were followed by Yung-Ch'eng and Sui-Jen (i.e., fire-man) the later being the Chinese [[Prometheus]], who brought the fire down from heaven and taught man its various uses.

The Prometheus myth is not indigenous to Greece, where it received the artistically classical form under which it is best known to us.  The name, which by  an ingenious afterthought is explained as "the fore thinker," is originally the Sanskrit pramantha and means "twirler" or "fire-stick," being the rod of hard wood which produced fire by rapid rotation in a piece of soft wood.

We cannot deny that the myth must have been known also in Mesopotamia, the main center of civilization between India and Greece, and it becomes probable that the figure Sui-Jen has been derived from the same prototype as the Greek Prometheus.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Carus, ''Chinese Astrology, Early Chinese Occultism'' (1974), from an earlier book by the same author, ''Chinese Thought'' (1907), chapter on "Chinese Occultism."  Note:  in 1907 the [[Wade-Giles]] system of transliteration was used&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The missionary and translator [[James Legge]] discusses Pangu:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
P'an-ku is spoken of by the common people as "the first man, who opened up heaven and earth." It has been said to me in "pidgin" English that "he is all the same your Adam"; and in Taoist picture books I have seen him as a shaggy, dwarfish, Hercules, developing from a bear rather than an ape, and wielding an immense hammer and chisel with which he is breaking the chaotic rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Legge, James (1881), ''The Religions of China: Confucianism and Tâoism Described and Compared with Christianity'', C. Scribner, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other Chinese creation myths==
{{See also|Chinese creation myth}}
The Pangu myth appears to have been preceded in ancient Chinese literature by the existence of [[Shangdi]] or Taiyi (of the ''[[Taiyi Shengshui]]''). Other Chinese myths, such as those of [[Nüwa|Nuwa]] and the [[Jade Emperor]], try to explain how people were created and do not necessarily explain the creation of the world. There are many variations of these myths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.lib.ndhu.edu.tw/libhtml/series/200406/6-001-024.pdf 盤古神話探源] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111041720/http://www1.lib.ndhu.edu.tw/libhtml/series/200406/6-001-024.pdf |date=2013-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Buyei culture==
According to [[Buyei]] mythology, after Pangu became an expert in rice farming after creating the world, he married the daughter of the [[Dragon King]], and their union gave rise to the Buyei people.

The daughter of the Dragon King and Pangu had a son named [[Xinheng]] (新横). When Xinheng disrespected his mother, she returned to heaven and never came down, despite the repeated pleas of her husband and son. Pangu was forced to remarry and eventually died on the sixth day of the sixth month of the [[lunar calendar]].

Xinheng's stepmother treated him badly and almost killed him. When Xinheng threatened to destroy her rice harvest, she realized her mistake. She made peace with him, and they went on to pay their respects to Pangu annually on the sixth day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar. This day became an important traditional Buyei holiday for [[ancestral worship]].

This legend of creation is one of the main characteristics that distinguishes the Buyei from the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]].

==Worship==
Pangu is worshipped at a number of shrines in contemporary [[China]], usually with [[Taoism|Taoist]] symbols, such as the [[Bagua]].

The Pangu King Temple built in 1809 is located in [[Guangdong Province]], northwest [[Huadu District]] (west of G106 / north of S118), north of [[Shiling, Guangzhou|Shiling Town]] at the foot of the Pangu King Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luopan.com/t/en_US/510000L000158.html Pangu King Temple Park Travel Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Huadu District is located north of [[Guangzhou]] to the west of the [[Baiyun International Airport]].

'''Project Vitello''' was a [[military operation]] that transferred the [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX–X|9.2-inch Mark X breech-loading gun]] at [[Spur Battery]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]] to the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford|Imperial War Museum]] in [[Duxford]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[England]]. Project Vitello I, the first phase, entailed the dismantling of the gun by the [[Royal Engineers]] at the [[artillery battery]] and transporting it to the [[Gibdock|Gibraltar dockyard]] in 1981. It was then shipped to [[Portsmouth]] on a [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] vessel. Project Vitello II, the second phase, began with the arrival of the gun in Portsmouth and involved transporting the gun to the [[Duxford Aerodrome]]. The Royal Engineers not only reassembled the gun and its mount, but also constructed a base, shell pit, and [[parapet]], with the operation completed in 1982. The Gibraltar Gun was inaugurated that year by Sir [[John Grandy]], Chairman of the Trustees of the Imperial War Museum.

==History==

[[File:HMS Thunderer Gun Explosion.png|thumb|right|{{HMS|Thunderer|1872}}, 2 January 1879, explosion of a [[muzzle-loading gun]]]]
The 9.2-inch Mark X breech-loading gun ''(pictured above)'' on display at the Imperial War Museum at Duxford Aerodrome in England originated at Spur Battery in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Crown Dependencies &amp; Overseas Territories|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/publications-and-documents/treaties/uk-overseas-territories/list-crown-dependencies-overseas|work=fco.gov.uk|publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After the Battle Magazine, Number 33|url=http://www.afterthebattle.com/magazine/issues26-50.html|work=afterthebattle.com|publisher=Battle of Britain International Limited|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Vitello: Disassembly of the Spur Battery on Gibraltar 1980|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205183383|work=Iwm.org.uk|publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]]s|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1914, more than one hundred of the guns had been installed at [[artillery battery|emplacements]] in strategic areas across the [[British Empire]]. However, by 1981, Gibraltar's 9.2-inch guns were the only remnants of a weapon that had at one time been mounted on numerous artillery batteries. [Two more 9.2 inch Mk X guns survive at Oliver's Battery, on Rottnest Island, Western Australia. As of 2012, one has been restored, the other is still awaiting restoration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rottnest Island#Military history]]&lt;/ref&gt;] The [[Imperial War Museum|Imperial War Museum's]] decision to preserve one of the weapons was based on its symbolism of [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] links to Gibraltar since the turn of the eighteenth century, as well as its former status as the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] most important gun for [[coastal defence and fortification|coastal defence]].&lt;ref name=discover&gt;{{cite web|title=Spur Battery Project Vitello|url=http://www.discovergibraltar.com/pages/mainlogo/mainfrm.htm|work=discovergibraltar.com|publisher=DiscoverGibraltar.com (Click Gun Batteries, Spur Battery, then Project Vitello)|accessdate=31 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905140025/http://www.discovergibraltar.com/pages/mainlogo/mainfrm.htm|archivedate=5 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the explosion of one of the 38-ton guns aboard {{HMS|Thunderer|1872}} on 2 January 1879, a Committee on Ordnance was established to evaluate the United Kingdom's artillery and its future. The committee was to consider "the question of breech-loading guns and such other questions as may be brought before it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870-1881|publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]]|isbn= 9781557502131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxZ61ZF4Ea8C&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=Committee+on+Ordnance,+1879&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=At-ZsDq5Fq&amp;sig=oSeyATA1wapVpxhrOMgW9Z8wpjg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AaeRULqYMdH7yAHh9oH4DQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Committee%20on%20Ordnance%2C%201879&amp;f=false|author=Beeler, John|edition=illustrated|accessdate=31 October 2012|page=80|date=1 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Late Naval Gunnery Disaster|url=http://www.cerberus.com.au/thunderer_gun.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[Illustrated London News]]|date=25 January 1879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bursting a Great Gun|url=http://www.cerberus.com.au/thunderer_gun.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=4 February 1880}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Admiralty]] wanted a gun similar to one that was manufactured by [[Friedrich Krupp AG]] in [[Essen]], [[Germany]]. The [[Rifled Breech Loader|rifled breech-loading]] gun that resulted was an improvement over traditional [[Rifled Muzzle Loader|rifled muzzle-loading]] weapons. The 9.2-inch [[breech-loading weapon]] was initially a naval gun, but was selected for use in coastal defence, the purpose of which was protection of naval bases, harbours, and ports, as well as prevention of invasion. In the late nineteenth century, [[torpedo boats]] and larger enemy vessels clad in iron posed a major threat to coastal countries, including those of the British Empire. Smaller guns were mounted to handle torpedo boats. However, the 9.2-inch guns were selected to deal with hostile [[warships]] and their long-range attacks. While the weapons on warships were more powerful, coastal defence positions had the advantage of firing from a stable base. The 9.2-inch gun retained its importance in British coastal defence for more than fifty years, until the mid-twentieth century. However, in 1956, Coast Defence was eliminated as a separate branch of the military. Although the 9.2-inch guns were still the primary coastal defence weapon, the decision had been made that planes and [[guided missiles]] were more effective in addressing invasion of a country or long-range attacks.&lt;ref name=discover/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twentieth Century British Coast Defence Guns|url=http://www.fsgfort.com/uploads/pdfs/Public/British%20Coastal%20Artillery%20P.pdf|work=fsgfort.com|publisher=[[Fortress Study Group]]|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project Vitello I==

The first phase of the project to transfer the 9.2-inch gun at Spur Battery in Gibraltar to the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire was entitled Project Vitello I. It encompassed the dismantling of the gun at the battery and its transport to the Gibraltar dockyard.&lt;ref name=cabinet&gt;{{cite web|title=Gibraltar Gun|url=http://www.cabinetwarrooms.org.uk/collections/item/object/70000380|work=cabinetwarrooms.org.uk|publisher=Imperial War Museums|accessdate=30 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121224012651/http://www.cabinetwarrooms.org.uk/collections/item/object/70000380|archivedate=24 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Engineers began the operation in the Spring of 1981. The 61 Field Support Squadron of the 36 Engineer Regiment found that access to the battery was somewhat difficult. There were space restrictions around the 9.2-inch gun, and the primary components of the gun had to be disassembled utilising traditional means.&lt;ref name=cabinet/&gt; The total weight of the gun and its associated components was 140 tons, which then had to be driven down Gibraltar's roads, maneuvering [[hairpin turns]] and a steep grade, to the Gibraltar dockyard.&lt;ref name=discover/&gt; The dismantling of the gun at Spur Battery was recorded, originally on [[Super 8 mm film]]. Now on [[16 mm film]], the footage, entitled ''Gibraltar's 9.2 Inch Gun'', is maintained by the Imperial War Museum at Duxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gibraltar's 9.2 Inch Gun|url=http://www.colonialfilm.org.uk/node/3246|work=colonialfilm.org.uk|publisher=Colonial Film|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gibraltar's 9.2 Inch Gun|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1060022232|work=iwm.org.uk|publisher=Imperial War Museums|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project Vitello II==

The second phase of the operation was entitled Project Vitello II. It commenced in August 1981 with the arrival of the gun at Portsmouth on [[RFA Bacchus (A404)|RFA ''Bacchus'' (A404)]] ''(link to photograph below)''.&lt;ref name=cabinet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical RFA - Archived Stories - Military Cargo|url=http://www.historicalrfa.org/archived-stories2/1190-military-cargo|work=historicalrfa.org|publisher=[[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] Historical Society|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RFA Bacchus (3) 1962-1981|url=http://www.rfaaplymouth.org/rfaaphotoarchive/displayimage.php?album=10&amp;pid=920|work=rfaaplymouth.org|publisher=Royal Fleet Auxiliary Association|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gun was transported to Duxford in eleven separate loads by the 56 Motor Transport (Training) Squadron of the Royal Engineers. The Engineers' 34 Field Squadron of the 39 Engineer Regiment then reassembled the 9.2-inch gun at the Duxford Aerodrome.&lt;ref name=cabinet/&gt; This was undertaken in several phases. At the site of the previous rifle range on the aerodrome, 34 Field Squadron built a concrete base in September 1981. Over a period of five weeks in November to December 1981, the squadron reassembled the 9.2-inch gun on the concrete plinth. The following year, in February 1982, a parapet was built in front of the weapon, as well as a shell pit beneath. The construction performed by the squadron was intended to give an appearance similar to that encountered at Spur Battery in Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=discover/&gt;&lt;ref name=cabinet/&gt; The gun is displayed between Buildings 177 and 178, adjacent to the [[American Air Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DRS Origins &amp; History|url=http://www.duxfordradiosociety.org/information/drshistory.html|work=duxfordradiosociety.org|publisher=Duxford Radio Society|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inauguration==

On 4 June 1982, Sir [[John Grandy]] (1913 &amp;ndash; 2004) dedicated the display of the 9.2-inch gun, which in England is also referred to as the Gibraltar Gun. Grandy, [[Marshall of the Royal Air Force]], had been the commanding officer at Duxford in 1942. After more than two and a half decades of leadership posts, Grandy became [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]] on 1 April 1967, the 49th anniversary of the founding of the [[Royal Air Force]]. Following his retirement in 1971, he served as [[Commander-in-chief]] and [[Governor of Gibraltar]] from 1973 to 1978. It represented the first time that an RAF officer filled that position. Grandy was Chairman of the Trustees of the Imperial War Museum from 1978 to 1989.&lt;ref name=discover/&gt;&lt;ref name=cabinet/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Marshal of the RAF Sir John Grandy|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1450975/Marshal-of-the-RAF-Sir-John-Grandy.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=6 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Red Book''', officially titled '''''Creating Opportunity: The Liberal Plan for Canada''''' was the [[election platform|platform]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]].  It earned its name from its bright red cover, red being the official colour of the Liberal Party. It was a 112-page booklet; many thousands of copies of it were printed, and it was widely distributed.  There was even talk of trying to mail a copy to each Canadian household, but it was decided this would be too expensive.

==Purpose==
It was exceptional in how specific it was; while platforms before and since have contained few substantive promises and many vague statements of principle, the Red Book laid out a long list of changes that the Liberals would make if brought to power.

It was also rare in Canada to have an entire platform released at once.  Generally, a party would release a policy idea, wait for it to gather as much media attention as possible, and then release another.  Those ideas had also been released during speeches by the party leader, not printed in unbending prose.

Perhaps most central was that the Liberal Red Book gave costs for each of their promises and summed them.  Never before had a party attempted to clearly prove that its promises were fiscally responsible and practical. [[Paul Martin]], the man who led the team that produced the Red Book was less complimentary about the Red Book in private as during his time in office as Finance Minister, he was often reported to have said: "Don't tell me about the Red Book, I wrote the damn thing, and I know that it is a lot of crap!".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, Brooke ''Divided Loyalties: The Liberal Party of Canada, 1984-2008'', Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010 page 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the first "[[contract]] with the public" type platforms, an idea used by the United States [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in its 1994 [[Contract with America]] and [[Mike Harris]]'s 1995 [[Common Sense Revolution]] in [[Ontario]].

==1993 Election==
The Liberals, out of power since 1984, were widely expected to win the 1993 election based on the great pan-Canadian dislike for the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[Brian Mulroney]].  The Liberals under [[Jean Chrétien]] were worried by a jump in Tory support with the selection of new leader [[Kim Campbell]].

A larger concern was the general Canadian antipathy towards politicians after the tumultuous and scandal plagued Mulroney years.  The 1992 [[referendum]] on the [[Charlottetown Accord]] was widely interpreted of a rejection of Canada's political elite by the general population.

To attempt to break through the cynicism and distrust the Liberals felt that being more specific and making many promises would help ensure a victory, thus the Red Book was created.

The Red Book was drafted mainly by [[Paul Martin]], who finished as runner-up in the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1990|1990 Liberal leadership convention]] to Chrétien, and [[Chaviva Hošek]] a top policy official with the Liberals. By giving Martin a prominent role in the campaign, this was seen as Chrétien's attempt to unify the Liberal Party.

===Impact===
The Liberals rolled out the Red Book on September 19, not long after the September 8 election call. Several days later, the Progressive Conservatives released the hastily assembled ''A Taxpayer's Agenda'', but the Liberals had captured the reputation of being the party with ideas since they had essentially released their entire platform. Thanks to the Red Book as well as a gradual decline in support for the governing Conservatives (unpopularity, vote splitting with Reform and Bloc), the Liberals won a strong majority government with 177 seats—the third-best result in the party's history, and their best performance since their record 190 seats in the [[Canadian federal election, 1949|1949 election]].  The Conservatives were nearly eliminated from the political scene, falling to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level.

==Broken promises==
The specificity of the Red Book came back to haunt the Liberals, however, and much of the next few years were spent defending broken promises.  The most notable of these was the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]], which the Liberals had promised to replace but did not.  Critics also said that the Liberals had broken their promises to increase the power of individual [[Members of Parliament]] and introduce a national [[childcare]] program.

In Chrétien's view, the majority of the promises were kept. He famously argued that 78% were honoured, a mark he could live with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/eppp-archive/100/205/300/liberal-ef/05-05-24/www.liberal.ca/history_e.aspx |title=Liberal Party of Canada - Official Web Site |publisher=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others contest whether some of these promises were kept or not.  Some of the most notable promises from the Red Book that were kept were the pledge to cancel the purchase of new naval [[helicopter]]s, canceling the sale of [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], reforming [[Unemployment benefit|unemployment insurance]], legislating more [[gun control]], and reducing the size of the armed forces with the end of the [[Cold War]]. Perhaps the most important pledge kept was that of returning Canada to fiscal solvency.

New Liberal Red Books were published for the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997]] and [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 elections]]. These contained far fewer specifics and more generalities.

{{Ital|Title}}
'''''Report to the Secretary on the Acquiescence of This Government in the Murder of the Jews''''' was the initial title of a government memorandum prepared by officials of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. Dated January 13, 1944, during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], its primary author was Assistant to the Secretary [[Josiah E. DuBois Jr.]]  Focusing on the period from late 1942 to late 1943, the report argued that certain officials within the [[United States State Department|US State Department]] not only had failed to use US government tools to rescue Jewish European refugees, but instead had used them to prevent or obstruct rescue attempts, as well as preventing relevant information from being made available to the American public. Described as "scathing" and as "political dynamite",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dubois53-54/&gt; the memorandum, re-titled ''Personal Report to the President'', helped convince President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to approve the creation of the [[War Refugee Board]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ReportText&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/report-on-the-acquiescence-of-fdr-government-in-the-murder-of-the-jews-january-1944|title=Report on the Acquiescence of FDR Government in the Murder of the Jews (January 1944)|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|language=en|access-date=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1938 President Roosevelt called for an international conference on the plight of Jewish European refugees; this was held in [[Évian-les-Bains]], France (and hence known as the [[Évian Conference]]), but no substantive change resulted.  The [[German Foreign Office]], in a sardonic reply, found it "astonishing" that other countries would decry Germany's treatment of Jews and then decline to admit them.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Ross, "The Hitler Vortex:  How American racism influenced Nazi thought", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', April 30, 2018, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
In the early 1940s, information about the [[The Holocaust|Nazi atrocities toward Europe's Jews]] started to become public knowledge but was dismissed by many as exaggerated. As time passed, it became an increasingly contentious matter in contemporary American politics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the same time, a public fear was generated concerning the security risk posed by admitting refugees to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-government-turned-away-thousands-jewish-refugees-fearing-they-were-nazi-spies-180957324/ |title=The U.S. Government Turned Away Thousands of Jewish Refugees, Fearing That They Were Nazi Spies |last=Gross |first=Daniel A. |date=November 18, 2015 |website=Smithsonian |language=en |access-date=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. State Department's Visa Division was responsible for issuing [[Travel visa|travel visas]] to foreign nationals seeking to get to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/timeline/1940-1949 |title=Administrative Timeline of the Department of State - Department History - Office of the Historian |website=history.state.gov |language=en |access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]], was the [[Secretary of the Treasury]] during the Roosevelt administration.  By 1943 the State Department publicly confirmed reports of some details of the [[Final Solution|Nazi plan]] to annihilate Jews, and Morganthau discussed this with his staff.  Officials at the Treasury Department were disappointed that the 1943 bi-national [[Bermuda Conference]] on refugees did not deliver results and suspected that the State Department had delayed financing for rescue of refugees.&lt;ref name=ushmm&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007408 |title=Henry Morgenthau |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |language=en |access-date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubois' report was written in the first person and focused on the time period between late 1942, and late 1943.  According to the report, in late 1942, largely through the efforts of Under Secretary of State [[Sumner Welles]], the United States publicly confirmed the Nazi program, and led its allies in a December 1942 public condemnation and promise of help. (At the time, the allies were known as the United Nations).  In January 1943, Welles cabled the American delegation in Switzerland for more information to be made public.  In February persons unknown sent a cable from State basically ordering the  diplomats in Switzerland not to make such information public.  In April, the Bermuda Conference between State Department staff and [[British Foreign Office]] staff met specifically to discuss refugee issues but results of the conference were kept secret. (As it turned out, neither the British nor Americans expressed much interest in taking concrete action on refugees.)  In the first half of 1943 several cables from State discussed a plan to fund refugee rescue.  In July, State finally approached Treasury about these refugee funds and Treasury approved but State continued to delay on the funding.  In addition, the report covered State's delays and failures in even filling refugee immigration quotas, ostensibly claiming security concerns. The report contains extended criticism, in particular of Assistant Secretary of State [[Breckinridge Long]] for delay and cover-up, and stressed that more than a year had gone by and nothing had been done, although people were dying and time was of the essence.&lt;ref name=ReportText/&gt;

The title of Dubois' document was later described as vehement, even fantastic, though "borne out by the grotesque revelations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mashberg|first=Michael|date=1977|title=Documents Concerning the American State Department and the Stateless European Jews, 1942&amp;ndash;1944|jstor=4466944|journal=Jewish Social Studies|volume=39|issue=1|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report given to the president by Morgenthau had a less "jarring", more technical title: "Personal Report to the President".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=HBOS30NAKOQC&amp;pg=PT138|title=Guarding the Golden Door: American Immigration Policy and Immigrants since 1882|last=Daniels|first=Roger|date=January 12, 2005|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=9781466806856|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was described as "scathing" and as "political dynamite",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dubois53-54" /&gt; in [[United States presidential election, 1944|election year 1944]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&amp;pg=PA176|title=Bearing Witness: How America and Its Jews Responded to the Holocaust|last=Feingold|first=Henry L.|date=1995|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=|isbn=9780815626701|location=|page=176|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of its receipt, Roosevelt approved the creation of a [[War Refugee Board]], a U.S. [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|executive agency]] to aid civilian victims of the [[Nazi]] and [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] powers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Royal Mail Ship''' (sometimes '''Steam-ship''' or '''Steamer'''), usually seen in its abbreviated form '''RMS''', is the [[ship prefix]] used for seagoing vessels that carry [[mail]] under contract to the British [[Royal Mail]]. The designation dates back to 1840.&lt;ref&gt;The first citation in ''The Times'' is from 18 August 1840.&lt;/ref&gt; Any vessel designated as "RMS" has the right to fly both the pennant of the Royal Mail when sailing and to include the Royal Mail "crown" insignia with any identifying device and/or design for the ship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Royal Mails employees Courier newspaper page 20 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nqsouthern.com/digitalpublication/digitalpublications/index.cfm?dpid=89&amp;section_id=673 QM2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613014957/http://www.nqsouthern.com/digitalpublication/digitalpublications/index.cfm?dpid=89&amp;section_id=673 |date=13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOTW"&gt;{{cite web|title=United Kingdom – Royal Mail|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-rmail.html|website=Flags of The World|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was used by many shipping lines, but is often associated in particular with the [[White Star Line]], [[Cunard Line]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxtone-Graham, John ''et al.'' (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=npnovPxcyKoC&amp;pg=PA184  ''Queen Mary 2,'' p. 184.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Mail Lines]] and [[Union-Castle Line]], which held a number of high-profile mail [[contract]]s, and traditionally prefixed the names of many of their ships with the initials "RMS". 

While some lines in the past, particularly the [[Royal Mail Lines]], called all their ships "RMS", technically a [[ship]] would use the prefix only while contracted to carry mail, and would revert at other times to a standard designation such as [[Steamship|"SS"]].&lt;ref name="nyt1935"&gt;By Wireless from R.M.S.

==History==
[[File:PRINCE ARTHUR CDSPC.JPG|thumb|left|[[RMS Prince Arthur|RMS ''Prince Arthur'']].]]
[[File:RMS Titanic 3.jpg|thumb|right|{{RMS|Titanic}} departing [[Port of Southampton|Southampton]], England, for the first and only time, in 1912.]]
Originally the [[Admiralty]] operated these ships.&lt;ref&gt;The Admiralty took over the [[Packet ship|Packet Service]] from the General Post Office in 1823.&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation "RMS" has been used since 1840.&lt;ref&gt;The first citation in ''[[The Times]]'' is from 18 August 1840.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 contracts were awarded to private companies. Having the title "RMS" was seen as a mark of quality and a competitive advantage, because the mail had to be on time.

The most valuable route, with the highest volume, was between Kingstown (now [[Dún Laoghaire]]), in [[Ireland]], and [[Holyhead]] in [[Wales]]. The [[City of Dublin Steam Packet Company]] (CDSPCo) won the contract. They bought RMS ''St Columba'' and RMS ''Llewellyn'' from the Admiralty to supplement their ''Prince Arthur''.

In the CDSPCo contract, in 1860, there was a penalty clause of [[Pound sterling|£]] 1 [[shilling|1s]] [[Penny|4d]] for every minute's delay.

The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s trans-Pacific Royal Mail contract required the building of the first three of a fleet of steamships: the {{RMS|Empress of China|1891|6}}, {{RMS|Empress of India|1891|6}} and {{RMS|Empress of Japan|1891|6}} which regularly sailed between Vancouver and Asia beginning in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, John. (1903). [https://books.google.com/books?id=GKa__JzumkcC&amp;pg=PR16 ''The History of Steam Navigation,'' pp. 147–151.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The RMS designation was also used on the ships [[White Star Line]], [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;O]] and the [[Cunard]] lines of the 19th and 20th century.

==Modern times==
[[Image:Royal Mail aircraft 20080215.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Mail]] aircraft-marking; on a [[British Airways]] [[Airbus A320 family#A320|Airbus A320-232]] G-EUUI. (Uniform India)]]

In recent years the shift to air transport for mail has left only three ships with the right to the prefix or its variations:  {{RMS|Segwun}}, which serves as a passenger vessel in [[Gravenhurst, Ontario]], Canada; {{ship|RMV|Scillonian III}}, which serves the [[Isles of Scilly]]; and {{RMS|Queen Mary 2}}. QM2 was conferred "RMS" by Royal Mail when she entered service in 2004 on the Southampton to New York route as a gesture to Cunard's history.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The Royal Mail continues a form of this tradition on modern day [[airliner]]s. The [[United Kingdom|UK's]] [[flag carrier]] airline, [[British Airways]], is contracted to carry mail on some of its scheduled long-distance routes. Aircraft operating these routes with the facilities to carry mail are allowed to display the Royal Mail's logo and crest on their fuselage, usually alongside their registration markings.

==Other designations==
The less-common designations '''RMMV''' for '''Royal Mail Motor Vessel''' and '''RMMS''' for '''Royal Mail Motor Ship''', were used for a period when RMS was restricted to steam-ships. Motor Vessel and Motor Ship indicated that propulsion was provided by [[diesel engine|diesel]] rather than [[steam engine|steam]].

The {{ship|RMV|Scillonian III}} carries the designation '''RMV''' for '''Royal Mail Vessel''' and is the only active RMV.

The '''scimitar oryx''' or '''scimitar-horned oryx''' (''Oryx dammah''), also known as the '''Sahara oryx''', is a species of ''[[Oryx]]'' once widespread across North Africa which went [[extinct in the wild]] in 2000.

It has a long taxonomic history since its scientific description in 1816 by [[Lorenz Oken]], who named it ''Oryx algazel''. This [[antelope]] stands a little more than {{convert|1|m|ft|}} at the shoulder. The males weigh {{convert|140|-|210|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the females weigh {{convert|91|-|140|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The coat is white with a red-brown chest and black markings on the forehead and down the length of the nose. The calves are born with a yellow coat without distinguishing marks; their coats change to adult coloration at 3–12 months old.

The scimitar oryx formed herds of mixed sexes of up to 70 members, usually guided by the bulls. They inhabited [[semidesert]]s and deserts and were adapted to live in the extreme heat, with their efficient cooling mechanism and very low requirement of water. Scimitar oryx feed on foliage, grasses, [[succulent plants]] and plant parts during the night or early morning. Births peak between March and October. After a [[Pregnancy (mammals)|gestation]] of eight to nine months, one calf is born. Soon after, the female has a [[postpartum estrus]].

The scimitar oryx was once widespread across northern Africa. Its decline began as a result of climate change during the [[neolithic]] period, and later it was hunted extensively for its horns. Today, it is bred in captivity in special reserves in [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]] and [[Senegal]] and on private exotic animal ranches in the [[Texas Hill Country]]. In 2016 a [[reintroduction]] program was launched and currently a small herd has been successfully reintroduced in [[Chad]].&lt;ref name=rein&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates/1395293173012.html|title=EAD successfully reintroduces 25 Scimitar Horned Oryx in Chad|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425153705/https://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates/1395293173012.html|archivedate=2016-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scimitar oryx was domesticated in [[Ancient Egypt]] and is believed to have been used as food and sacrificed as offerings to gods. Wealthy people in [[Ancient Rome]] also bred them. The use of their valuable hides began in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[unicorn]] myth may have originated from sightings of a scimitar oryx with a broken horn.

The scimitar oryx was the emblem of the ancient Egyptian [[Oryx nome]] and today is the animal symbol of the [[Sahara Conservation Fund]].

==Taxonomy and naming==

The scimitar oryx is a member of the genus ''[[Oryx]]'' and family [[Bovidae]]. The German naturalist [[Lorenz Oken]] first [[species description|described]] it in 1816, naming it ''Oryx algazel''. The [[nomenclature]] has undergone various changes since then, with the introduction of names like ''Oryx tao'', ''O. leucoryx'', ''O. damma'', ''O. dammah'', ''O. bezoarticus'' and ''O. ensicornis''. In 1826, [[Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar]] used the name ''Oryx ammah'' for the species. A year later, the name ''Oryx leucoryx'' came into use, but as this was a synonym of the Arabian oryx (then called ''Oryx beatrix''), it was abandoned, and ''Oryx algazel'' was accepted once more. Over a hundred years later, in 1951, [[Sir John Ellerman, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Ellerman]] and [[Terence Morrison-Scott]] found that the name ''Oryx algazel'' was also ineligible for use. Finally, in January 1956, the International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature accepted ''Oryx dammah'' as the scientific name. There have been no more changes since then, though many papers published after 1956 created confusion by using names like ''O. gazella tao''.&lt;ref name=mpt&gt;{{cite book|first1=T.|last1=Gilbert|first2=T.|last2=Woodfine|title=The Biology, Husbandry and Conservation of Scimitar-horned Oryx (Oryx dammah)|year=2004|url=http://www.saharaconservation.org/IMG/pdf/The_biology_husbandry_and_conservation_of_Scimitar-horned_oryx.pdf|publisher=Marwell Preservation Trust|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-9521397-2-0|edition=2nd|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804110820/http://saharaconservation.org/IMG/pdf/The_biology_husbandry_and_conservation_of_Scimitar-horned_oryx.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its scientific name, ''Oryx dammah'', is derived from: [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὄρυξ}} (''orux''), meaning a [[gazelle]] or [[antelope]] (originally a pickaxe&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|oryx|accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;); [[Latin]] ''damma'' ([[fallow deer]] or antelope); and [[Arabic]] ''dammar'' (sheep).&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt; The scimitar oryx is named for its [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]],&lt;ref name=ARKive&gt;{{cite web|title=Scimitar-horned oryx  (''Oryx dammah'')|url=http://www.arkive.org/scimitar-horned-oryx/oryx-dammah/#text=All|publisher=ARKive}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resemble [[scimitar]]s.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt; Its common name in English is "scimitar-horned oryx", or simply "scimitar oryx".&lt;ref name=mpt/&gt;

==Genetics and evolution==

The scimitar oryx has 58 [[chromosome]]s. It has one pair of large [[centrosome#submetacentric|submetacentric]] [[autosome]]s and 27 [[centromere#Acrocentric|acrocentric]] autosomal pairs. The [[X chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome|Y]] chromosomes are the largest and smallest acrocentrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Claro|first=F.|author2=Hayes, H.|author3=Cribiu, E.P.|title=The C-, G-, and R-banded karyotype of the scimitar-horned oryx (''Oryx dammah'')|journal=Hereditas|year=1994|volume=120|issue=1|pages=1–6|pmid=8206781|doi=10.1111/j.1601-5223.1994.00001.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first molecular study of this species (published in 2007) observed genetic diversity among European, North American and some other captive groups. Divergence was found within the mitochondrial DNA [[haplotype]]s, and was estimated to have taken place between 2.1 and 2.7 million years ago. Population increases occurred approximately 1.2 and 0.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iyengar|first=A.|author2=Gilbert, T.|author3=Woodfine, T.|author4=Knowles, J.

In another study, intended to note genetic differences between ''Oryx'' species, [[karyotype]]s of ''Oryx'' species and subspecies&amp;nbsp;– namely ''[[Gemsbok|O. gazella]]'', ''[[East African oryx|O. b. beisa]]'', ''[[Fringe-eared oryx|O. b. callotis]]'', ''O. dammah'' and ''[[Arabian oryx|O. leucoryx]]''&amp;nbsp;– were compared with the standard karyotype of ''[[Bos taurus]]''. The number of autosomes in all karyotypes was 58. The X and Y chromosomes were conserved in all five species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumamoto|first=A.T.|author2=Charter, S.J.|author3=Kingswood, S.C.|author4=Ryder, O.A.|author5=Gallagher Jr., D.S.|title=Centric fusion differences among ''Oryx dammah'', ''O. gazella,'' and ''O. leucoryx'' (Artiodactyla, Bovidae)|journal=Cytogenetic and Genome Research|year=1999|volume=86|issue=1|pages=74–80|doi=10.1159/000015416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical description==

The large, spreading [[hooves]] are well adapted to allow these antelopes to walk on the sand of their dry habitats.&lt;ref name="ARKive"/&gt; A scimitar oryx can live as long as 20 years.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="snzpsmith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="olf"/&gt; At [[Smithsonian National Zoo]], a female oryx died at 21, an exceptional age since females generally have a lifespan of about 15 years.&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite news|last=Zoon|first=J.|title=Elderly Oryx Dies at Smithsonian's National Zoo|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/elderly-oryx-dies-smithsonian-s-national-zoo|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=Smithsonian Newsdesk|date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diseases and parasites==

The scimitar oryx can be infected with [[cryptosporidiosis]], a [[parasitic disease]] caused by [[protozoa]]n parasites of genus ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' in the phylum [[Apicomplexa]]. A study in 2004 revealed that ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum|C. parvum]]'' or similar organisms infected 155 mammal species, including the scimitar oryx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fayer|first=R.|title=''Cryptosporidium'': a water-borne zoonotic parasite|journal=Veterinary Parasitology|year=2004|volume=126|issue=1–2|pages=37–56|doi=10.1016/j.vetpar.2004.09.004|pmid=15567578|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=10394&amp;content=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis in 2005 found ''Cryptosporidium'' parasites in stool samples from 100 mammals, including the scimitar oryx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alves|first=M.|author2=Xiao, L.|author3=Lemos, V.|author4=Zhou, L.|author5=Cama, V.|author6=Cunha, M.

It had caused vegetative [[endocarditis]] in the animal, leading to fatal congestive [[heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chai|first=N.|title=Vegetative endocarditis in a scimitar-horned oryx (''Oryx dammah'')|journal=Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians|date=December 1999|volume=30|issue=4|pages=587–8|pmid=10749451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1983 study examined the [[blood serum]] chemistry of blood samples taken from the jugular veins of fifty scimitar oryx ranging from neonates to adults over 13 years old. The study concluded that the higher [[eosinophil]] counts of the juveniles and adults might reflect larger internal parasite burdens in them as compared with the neonates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bush|first=M.|author2=Custer, R.

J.|title=Hematologic and serum chemistry values of captive scimitar-horned oryx (''Oryx tao''): variations with age and sex|journal=The Journal of Zoo Animal Medicine|year=1983|volume=14|issue=2|pages=51|doi=10.2307/20094637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology and behavior==

The scimitar oryx was a very sociable animal and traveled in herds of between two and forty individuals, generally, led by a [[Dominance (ethology)|dominant]] bull. This species once gathered in groups of several thousand for [[Animal migration|migration]]. During the wet season, they migrated north into the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt; Scimitar oryx are [[Diurnality|diurnal]]. In the cool early mornings and evenings, they rest under trees and shrubs, or if neither are available, they dig depressions in the soil with their hooves and rest there. Males fight often, but not for long and not violently. Predators, such as lions, leopards, hyenas, cheetahs, golden jackals, vultures and Cape hunting dogs, mostly kill weak and young oryx.&lt;ref name=mpt/&gt;&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt;

The play activity of eight calves in captivity was observed in a 1983 study. Male calves played for longer than females calves did. Mixed sex play was usual; selection of partners depended on age, but not on sex or genetic relatedness. Results suggested that size [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphism]] was an important factor responsible for sex differences in play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pfeifer|first=S.|title=Sex differences in social play of scimitar-horned oryx calves (''Oryx dammah'')|journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie|year=1985|volume=69|issue=4|pages=281–92|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1985.tb00153.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptations===
[[File:Oryx dammah -Marwell Wildlife, Hampshire, England-8a.jpg|left|thumb|Captive Scimitar oryx grazing in a paddock]]
With a [[metabolism]] that functions at the high temperatures prevalent in their habitats, scimitar oryx need less water for evaporation to help conduct heat away from the body, enabling them to go for long periods without water. They can allow their body temperature to rise to almost {{convert|46.5|C|F|abbr=on}} before beginning to perspire.&lt;ref name="ARKive"/&gt; In times of ample supply, oryx can use fluid loss through urination and feces to lower their body temperature to below {{convert|36|C|abbr=on}} at night, giving more time before reaching maximum body temperature the following day.&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt; They can tolerate high temperatures that would be lethal to most mammals. They have a network of fine blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the brain, passing close to the nasal passage and thus allowing the blood to cool by up to {{convert|3|C-change|abbr=on|0}} before reaching the brain, which is one of the most heat-sensitive organs of the body.&lt;ref name=snzpsmith&gt;{{cite web|title=Scimitar-horned Oryx|url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/AfricanSavanna/Facts/fact-oryx.cfm|publisher=[[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt;

===Diet===
The habitat of scimitar oryx in the wild was steppe and desert, where they ate foliage, grass, herbs, shrubs, succulent plants, legumes, juicy roots, buds, and fruit.&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt; They can survive without water for nine to ten months because their kidneys prevent water loss from urination&amp;nbsp;– an adaptation to desert habitats. They can get water from water-rich plants such as the wild melon (''[[Citrullus colocynthis]]'') and ''[[Indigofera oblongifolia]]'' and from the leafless twigs of ''[[Capparis decidua]]''. In the night or early morning, they often search for plants such as ''Indigofera colutea'', which produce a [[hygroscopic]] secretion that fulfils water requirements. They eat tuft grasses such as ''[[Cymbopogon schoenanthus]]'' after it has rained, but they normally prefer more palatable grasses, such as ''[[Cenchrus biflorus]]'', ''[[Panicum laetum]]'' and ''[[Dactyloctenium aegyptium]]''. When the dry season begins, they feed on the seedpods of ''[[Acacia raddiana]]'', and during the dry season, they rely on [[perennial]] grasses of genera such as ''[[Panicum]]'' (especially ''[[Panicum turgidum]]'') and ''[[Aristida]]'', and browse plants such as ''[[Leptadenia]]'' species, ''[[Cassia italica]]'' and ''[[Cornulaca monacantha]]''.&lt;ref name=mpt/&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Oryx dammah 001.jpg|thumb|A young scimitar oryx]]
[[File:Oryx Dammah 002.jpg|thumb|A young oryx with its mother]]
Both males and females reach [[sexual maturity]] at 1.5 to 2 years of age.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt; Births peak between March and October.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt; Mating frequency is greater when environmental conditions are favorable. In zoos, males are sexually most active in autumn.&lt;ref name=mpt/&gt; The [[estrous cycle]] lasts roughly 24 days, and females experience an [[anovulatory cycle|anovulatory period]] in spring. Periods between births are less than 332 days, showing that the scimitar oryx is [[estrous cycle#Frequency|polyestrous]].&lt;ref name=morrow2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrow|first=C.J.|author2=Wildt, D.E.|author3=Monfort, S.L.|title=Reproductive seasonality in the female scimitar-horned oryx (''Oryx dammah'')|journal=Animal Conservation|year=1999|volume=2|issue=4|pages=261–8|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1795.1999.tb00072.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courting is done by means of a mating circle: the male and female stand parallel to one another, facing in opposite directions, and then circle around each other until the female allows the male to mount from behind. If the female is not ready to mate, she runs away and circles in the reverse direction.&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt; Pregnant females leave the herd for a week, give birth to the calf and conceive again during their [[postpartum estrus]]; thus they can produce a calf a year.&lt;ref name="waza"/&gt; [[Pregnancy (mammals)|Gestation]] lasts about nine months, after which a single calf is born, weighing {{Convert|10|-|15|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt; Twin births are very rare&amp;nbsp;- only 0.7% of the births observed in one study. Both mother and calf return to the main herd within hours of the birth.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt; The female separates herself from the herd for a few hours while she nurses the calf. Weaning starts at 3.5 months, and the young become fully independent at around 14 weeks old.&lt;ref name="ARKive"/&gt;

==Habitat and distribution==

The scimitar oryx once inhabited grassy [[steppes]], [[semideserts]]&lt;ref name=adw&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=H.|title=''Oryx dammah''|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Oryx_dammah.html|work=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|publisher=Animal Diversity Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deserts in a narrow strip of central north Africa ([[Niger]] and [[Chad]]).&lt;ref name="ARKive"/&gt; It was widespread on the fringes of the Sahara, mainly in subdesert steppe, the grassy zone between the real desert and the [[Sahel]], an area characterized by an annual rainfall of {{convert|75|-|150|mm|in|abbr=on}}. In 1936, a single herd of 10,000 oryx was seen in the steppe area of Chad. By the mid-1970s, Chad was home to more than 95% of the world population of this species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R.|last=East|title=West and Central Africa.|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/1988-015-3.pdf|year=1990|publisher=IUCN|location=Gland|isbn=2-8317-0016-7|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status and conservation==
[[File:Scimitar oryx1.jpg|thumb|left|A group of scimitar oryx at [[Marwell Zoo]] in Hampshire, [[Great Britain]]]]
Following the [[Neolithic Subpluvial]], around 7500 to 3500 BCE, the "green Sahara" became dry and the scimitar oryx's population began to decline due to a loss of suitable habitat.  This was further exacerbated by humans who hunted the oryx for both its meat and horns.  The northern population was already almost lost before the 20th century.  With the introduction of horses and firearms during the 20th century, nomadic hunters were able to decimate populations.&lt;ref name=Newby1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Newby |first1=J. E. |title=Scimitar-horned Oryx–the End of the Line? |journal=Oryx |date=24 April 2009 |year=1978|volume=14 |issue=03 |pages=219 |doi=10.1017/S0030605300015520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of the southern population accelerated as Europeans began to settle the area and hunt them for meat, hides and horn trophies. [[Capture of Kufra|French involvement in World War II]]&lt;ref name=Newby1 /&gt; and the [[Transitional Government of National Unity|Civil War in Chad]] that started in the 1960s are thought to have caused heavy decreases of the species through an increase in hunting for food.&lt;ref name="ARKive"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=''Oryx dammah (O. tao)''|url=http://www.animalinfo.org/species/artiperi/oryxdamm.htm|publisher=Animal Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roadkill]], nomadic settlements near watering holes (the oryx's dry-season feeding places), introduction of cattle and firearms for easy hunting have also reduced numbers.&lt;ref name=Newby1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Newby2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newby|first=J.|title=Can Addax and Oryx be saved in the Sahel?|journal=Oryx|year=1980|volume=15|issue=03|doi=10.1017/S0030605300024662|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[IUCN]] lists the scimitar oryx as regionally extinct in [[Algeria]], [[Burkina Faso]], Chad, [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Morocco]], Niger, [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Sudan]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Western Sahara]], and has assessed it as [[extinct in the wild]] since 2000. Reports of sightings in Chad and Niger remain unsubstantiated, despite extensive surveys carried out throughout Chad and Niger from 2001 to 2004 in an effort to detect antelopes in the Sahel and the Sahara. At least until 1985, 500 oryx were estimated to be surviving in Chad and Niger, but by 1988, only a few individuals survived in the wild.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;

There is now a global captive breeding program for the scimitar oryx.&lt;ref name=unep&gt;{{cite book|author=United Nations Environment Programme|title=Africa: Atlas of Our Changing Environment|url= http://www.unep.org/dewa/africa/africaAtlas/PDF/en/Africa_Atlas_Full_en.pdf |year=2008|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|location=Nairobi, Kenya|isbn=978-92-807-2871-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, about 1,750 captives were managed as part of breeding programs, up to 11,000 were kept in Texas farms and 4,000 were held in [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt; Reintroduction plans involve fenced-in herds in [[Bou-Hedma National Park]] (1985),&lt;ref name=gordon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Godon|first=I.J.|author2=Gill, J.P.|title=Reintroduction of Scimitar-horned oryx ''Oryx dammah'' to Bou-Hedma National Park, Tunisia|journal=International Zoo Yearbook|year=2007|volume=32|issue=1|pages=69–73|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1090.1993.tb03517.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sidi Toui National Park]] (1999) and [[Oued Dekouk National Park]] (1999) in [[Tunisia]]; [[Souss-Massa National Park]] (1995) in [[Morocco]]; and [[Ferlo Faunal Reserve]] (1998) and [[Guembuel Natural Reserve|Guembeul Wildlife Reserve]] (1999) in [[Senegal]].&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;

==In culture==
[[File:Oftheunicorn.jpg|thumb|Woodcut illustration of a [[unicorn]], from ''The History of Four-Footed Beasts and Serpents'' by [[Edward Topsell]]]]

===Ancient times===

In [[ancient Egypt]] scimitar oryx were domesticated&lt;ref name="ssa"/&gt; and tamed, possibly to be used as offerings for religious ceremonies or as food.&lt;ref name=olf&gt;{{cite web|title=Scimitar-horned oryx|url=http://www.safariwest.com/animal/scimitar-horned-oryx|publisher=Safari West}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were called ''ran'' and bred in captivity. In [[ancient Rome]] they were kept in paddocks and used for [[coursing]], and wealthy Romans ate them. The scimitar oryx was the preferred quarry of Sahelo-Saharan hunters. Its hide is of superior quality, and the king of [[Rio de Oro]] sent 1000 shields made of it to a contemporary in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since then, it has been used to make ropes, harnesses and saddlery.&lt;ref name="mpt"/&gt;

===Unicorn myth===

The myth of the one-horned [[unicorn]] may have originated from sightings of injured scimitar oryx; [[Aristotle]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] held that the oryx was the unicorn's "prototype".&lt;ref name="rice"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=M.|title=The Archaeology of the Arabian Gulf, c. 5000–323 BC|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-03268-7|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; From certain angles, the oryx may seem to have one horn rather than two,&lt;ref name="LA natural history museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nhm.org/exhibitions/halls/african/amh_oryx.html|title=Arabian Oryx|accessdate=2008-01-25|work=Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071010140714/http://www.nhm.org/exhibitions/halls/african/amh_oryx.html |archivedate = 2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tongren|first=S.|title=What's for Lunch: Animal Feeding at the Zoo|year=1981|publisher=GMG Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given that its horns are made from hollow bone that cannot be regrown, if an oryx were to lose one of its horns, for the rest of its life it would have only one.&lt;ref name="rice"/&gt;

===Modern Times===
In 2015, Yellow Nose, an oryx that lives in Portland, Oregon escaped and startled hikers in Forest Park&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/10/large_unusual-looking_horned_a.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The following day he was caught and returned home.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/10/yellow_nose_the_oryx_wandering.html&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow Nose inspired a parody twitter account of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/pdxoryx&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed Gleason's herd of oryx have escaped in the past as well. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-10901-more-bite-than-a-great-white-shark.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''side letter''' or '''side agreement''' or '''side letter arrangement''' is an agreement that is not part of the underlying or primary contract or agreement, and which some or all parties to the contract use to reach agreement on issues the primary contract does not cover or that need clarification, or to amend the primary contract.&lt;ref name="Darlingtonsblog"&gt;{{cite web |last=Swede |first=David |date=19 March 2013 |title=Side Letters: What Are They and When Are They Suitable? |url=http://www.darlingtons.com/blog/side-letters-what-are-they-and-when-are-they-suitable |publisher=Darlingtons Solicitors LLP |access-date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law of [[contract]]s, a side letter has the same force as the underlying or primary contract. However, the validity of side letters has been denied by some courts in specific circumstances.&lt;ref name="NPblog"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ughetta |first1=Ted |last2=Hamilton |first2=Harriett |date=10 February 2017 |title=A New Year's Wish: May All Your Side Letters Be Enforceable |url=http://web20.nixonpeabody.com/peblog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=234 |publisher=Nixon Peabody |access-date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Side letters are often used in financial or property transactions, or other commercial contracts.  They are usually in the form of a letter signed by parties signatory to the primary contract but can also be an oral agreement. As part of a business organization's governance strategy, side letters should be under similar controls to any other contractual agreement, as they can have significant financial or operational impact, or expose the organization to risks of many types.&lt;ref name="MHMblog"&gt;{{cite web |date=29 March 2016 |title=Has Your Company Used Side Letter Arrangements? |url=http://www.mhmcpa.com/News/ArtMID/3682/ArticleID/770/Has-Your-Company-Used-Side-Letter-Arrangements.aspx |publisher=MHM |access-date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Side letters are often used in private fund contracts as well. Often a particular investor will want to vary the terms of the limited partnership agreement with respect to that particular investor. An investor might be seeking more favourable terms under the contract or might need the side letter to enter the venture under terms to meet regulatory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Davie |first=Alexander J. |date=29 November 2017 |title=Using Side Letters in Private Funds |url=https://www.strictlybusinesslawblog.com/2017/11/29/using-side-letters-in-private-funds/ |website=Strictly Business|access-date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Meynell Rheam - Sleeping Beauty.jpg|thumb|300px|''Sleeping Beauty'', by [[Henry Meynell Rheam]]]]
'''''Sleeping Beauty''''' ({{lang-fr|La Belle au bois dormant}}), or '''''Little Briar Rose''''' ({{lang-de|[[:de:Dornröschen|Dornröschen]]}}), also titled in English as '''''The Sleeping Beauty in the Woods''''', is a classic [[fairy tale]] which involves a beautiful princess, a [[Suspended animation in fiction|sleeping enchantment]], and a handsome prince. The tale was originally published by [[Charles Perrault]]. The version collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]] was an orally transmitted version of the original literary tale published by Perrault in ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé]]'' in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;Bottigheimer, Ruth. (2008). "Before ''Contes du temps passe'' (1697): Charles Perrault's ''Griselidis'', ''Souhaits'' and ''Peau''". ''The Romantic Review'', Volume 99, Number 3. pp. 175–189.&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn was based on ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'' by Italian poet [[Giambattista Basile]] (published posthumously in 1634), which was in turn based on one or more [[folklore|folk tales]]. The earliest known version of the story is found in the narrative ''[[Perceforest]]'', composed between 1330 and 1344.

==Perrault's narrative==
Perrault’s narrative is written in two parts, which some folklorists believe were originally separate tales, as they were in the Brothers Grimm's version, and were later joined together by Giambattista Basile and once more by Perrault.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', 2002:96, {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Baptism|christening]] of a king and queen's long-wished-for child, seven good [[Fairy|fairies]] are invited to be [[Godparent|godmothers]] to the infant princess. The fairies attend the banquet at the palace. Each fairy is presented with a golden plate and drinking cups adorned with jewels. Soon after, an old [[Wicked fairy godmother|fairy]] enters the palace and is seated with a plate of fine china and a crystal drinking glass. This old fairy is overlooked because she has been within a tower for many years and everyone had believed her to be deceased. Six of the other seven fairies then offer their gifts of beauty, wit, grace, dance, song, and goodness to the infant princess. The evil fairy is very angry about having been forgotten, and as her gift, enchants the infant princess so that she will one day prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The seventh fairy, who hasn't yet given her gift, attempts to reverse the evil fairy's curse. However, she can only do so partially. Instead of dying, the Princess will fall into a deep sleep for 100 years and be awakened by a kiss from a king's son. This is her gift of protection.

The King orders that every spindle and spinning wheel in the kingdom to be destroyed, to try to save his daughter from the terrible curse. Fifteen or sixteen years pass and one day, when the king and queen are away, the Princess wanders through the palace rooms and comes upon an old woman, spinning with her spindle. The princess, who has never seen anyone spin before, asks the old woman if she can try the spinning wheel. The curse is fulfilled as the princess pricks her finger on the spindle and instantly falls into a deep sleep. The old woman cries for help and attempts are made to revive the princess. The king attributes this to fate and has the Princess carried to the finest room in the palace and placed upon a bed of gold and silver embroidered fabric. The king and queen kiss their daughter goodbye and depart, proclaiming the entrance to be forbidden. The good fairy who altered the evil prophecy is summoned. Having great powers of foresight, the fairy sees that the Princess will awaken to distress when she finds herself alone, so the fairy puts everyone in the castle to sleep. The fairy also summons a forest of trees, brambles and thorns that spring up around the castle, shielding it from the outside world and preventing anyone from disturbing the Princess. they  kiss a prince shalom

A hundred years pass and a prince from another family spies the hidden castle during a hunting expedition. His attendants tell him differing stories regarding the castle until an old man recounts his father's words: within the castle lies a beautiful princess who is doomed to sleep for a hundred years until a king's son comes and awakens her. The prince then braves the tall trees, brambles and thorns which part at his approach, and enters the castle. He passes the sleeping castle folk and comes across the chamber where the Princess lies asleep on the bed. Struck by the radiant beauty before him, he falls on his knees before her. The enchantment comes to an end by a kiss and the princess awakens and converses with the prince for a long time. Meanwhile, the rest of the castle awakens and go about their business. The prince and princess are later married by the chaplain in the castle chapel.

===Part two===
After wedding the Princess in secret, the Prince continues to visit her and she bears him two children, Aurore (Dawn) and Jour (Day), unbeknown to his mother, who is of an ogre lineage. When the time comes for the Prince to ascend the throne, he brings his wife, children, and the talabutte ("Count of the Mount").

The Ogress Queen Mother sends the young Queen and the children to a house secluded in the woods and directs her cook to prepare the boy with  ''[[Sauce Robert]]'' for dinner. The kind-hearted cook substitutes a lamb for the boy, which satisfies the Queen Mother. She then demands the girl but the cook this time substitutes a young goat, which also satisfies the Queen Mother. When the Ogress demands that he serve up the young Queen, the latter offers to slit her throat so that she may join the children that she imagines are dead. While the Queen Mother is satisfied with a [[red deer|hind]] prepared with ''Sauce Robert'' in place of the young Queen, there is a tearful secret reunion of the Queen and her children. However, the Queen Mother soon discovers the cook’s trick and she prepares a tub in the courtyard filled with vipers and other noxious creatures. The King returns in the nick of time and the Ogress, her true nature having been  exposed, throws herself into the tub and is fully consumed. The King, young Queen, and children then live happily ever after.

==Basile's narrative==
In Giambattista Basile's version of Sleeping Beauty, ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleeping beauty is named Talia. By asking wise men and astrologers to predict her future after her birth, her father who is a great lord learns that Talia will be in danger from a splinter of flax. The splinter later causes what appears to be Talia's death; however, it is later learned that it is a long, deep sleep. After Talia falls into deep sleep, she is seated on a velvet throne and her father, to forget his misery of what he thinks is her death, closes the doors and abandons the house forever. One day, while a king is walking by, one of his falcons flies into the house. The king knocks, hoping to be let in by someone, but no one answers and he decides to climb in with a ladder. He finds Talia alive but unconscious, and "...gathers the first fruits of love." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sleeping Beauty|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he leaves her in the bed and goes back to his kingdom. Though Talia is unconscious, she gives birth to twins — one of whom keeps sucking her fingers. Talia awakens because the twin has sucked out the flax that was stuck deep in Talia's finger. When she wakes up, she discovers that she is a mother and has no idea what happened to her. One day, the king decides he wants to go see Talia again. He goes back to the palace to find her awake and a mother to his twins. He informs her of who he is, what has happened, and they end up bonding. After a few days, the king has to leave to go back to his realm, but promises Talia that he will return to take her to his kingdom.

When he arrives back in his kingdom, his wife hears him saying "Talia, Sun, and Moon" in his sleep. She bribes and threatens the king's secretary to tell her what is going on. After the queen learns the truth, she pretends she is the king and writes to Talia asking her to send the twins because he wants to see them. Talia sends her twins to the "king" and the queen tells the cook to kill the twins and make dishes out of them. She wants to feed the king his children; instead, the cook takes the twins to his wife and hides them. He then cooks two lambs and serves them as if they were the twins. Every time the king mentions how good the food is, the queen replies, "Eat, eat, you are eating of your own." Later, the queen invites Talia to the kingdom and is going to burn her alive, but the king appears and finds out what’s going on with his children and Talia. He then orders that his wife be burned along with those who betrayed him. Since the cook actually did not obey the queen, the king thanks the cook for saving his children by giving him rewards. The story ends with the king marrying Talia and living happily ever after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basile|first=Giambattista|title=Sun, Moon, and Talia|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html#basile|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ring34.jpg|175 px|thumb|An older image of the sleeping princess: [[Brünnhilde]], surrounded by magical fire rather than roses (illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walküre]]'')]]

There are earlier elements that contributed to the tale. In the medieval courtly romance ''[[Perceforest]]'' (published in 1528), a princess named Zellandine falls in love with a man named Troylus. Her father sends him to perform tasks to prove himself worthy of her, and while he is gone, Zellandine falls into an enchanted sleep. Troylus finds her and impregnates her in her sleep; when their child is born, he draws from her finger the flax that caused her sleep. She realizes from the ring he left her that the father was Troylus, who later returns to marry her.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 648, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier influences come from the story of the sleeping [[Brynhild]] in the ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' and the tribulations of saintly female martyrs in early Christian [[hagiography]] conventions. It was, in fact, the existence of Brynhild that persuaded the [[Brothers Grimm]] to include the story in later editions of their work rather than eliminate it, as they did to other works they deemed to be purely French, stemming from Perrault's work. Their decision was odd on one point, at least, since in none of the Teutonic myths, meaning the Poetic and Prose Eddas or Volsunga Saga, is their sleeper awakened with a kiss, a fact Jacob Grimm would certainly have known, who wrote an important and encyclopedic volume on [[German mythology]].

The second half, in which the princess and her children are almost put to death, but instead hidden, may have been influenced by [[Genevieve of Brabant]].&lt;ref name="Genevieve of Brabant"&gt;Charles Willing, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Genevieve_of_Brabant.html?id=4Ac6qAAACAAJ "Genevieve of Brabant"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
{{Redirect|Aurora (Sleeping Beauty)|the Disney variation of the character|Aurora (Disney)}}
The princess's name has varied from one adaptation to the other. In ''Sun, Moon, and Talia'', she is named Talia (Sun and Moon being her twin children). She has no name in Perrault's story but her daughter is called  "Aurore". The Brothers Grimm named her "Briar Rose" in their 1812 collection.&lt;ref name="Little Briar-Rose"&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Grimms' Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/stories/littlebriarose.html "Little Briar-Rose"]&lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky's ballet and Disney's version named her Princess Aurora; however, in the Disney version, she is also called "Briar Rose" in her childhood, when she is being raised incognito by the good fairies.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/notes.html#FORTY4 The Annotated Sleeping Beauty]"&lt;/ref&gt; John Stejean named her "Rosebud" in TeleStory Presents.

The [[Brothers Grimm]] included a variant '' Little Briar Rose'' in their collection (1812).&lt;ref name="Little Briar-Rose"/&gt; Their version ends when the prince arrives to wake Sleeping Beauty, unlike the stories of Basile and Perrault.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Velten, "The Influences of Charles Perrault's Contes de ma Mère L'oie on German Folklore", p 961, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some translations of the Grimms' tale give the princess the name "Rosamond". The brothers considered rejecting the story on the grounds that it was derived from Perrault's version, but the presence of the Brynhild tale convinced them to include it as an authentically German tale. Still, it is the only known German variant of the tale, and Perrault's influence is almost certain.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Velten, "The Influences of Charles Perrault's Contes de ma Mère L'oie on German Folklore", p 962, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brothers Grimm also included, in the first edition of their tales, a fragmentary fairy tale, "The Evil Mother-in law". This story begins with the heroine a married mother of two children, as in the second part of Perrault's tale, and her mother-in-law attempting to eat her and the children. Unlike Perrault's version, the heroine suggested an animal be substituted in the dish, and ends with the heroine's worry that she cannot keep her children from crying and getting the mother-in-law’s attention. Like many German tales showing French influence, it appeared in no subsequent edition.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 376-7 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italo Calvino]] included a variant in ''[[Italian Folktales]]''. The cause of her sleep is an ill-advised [[wish]] by her mother. As in ''[[Pentamerone]]'', the prince rapes her in her sleep and her children are born. He retains the element that the woman who tries to kill the children is the king's mother, not his wife, but adds that she does not want to eat them herself, but instead serves them to the king. His version came from Calabria, but he noted that all Italian versions closely followed Basile's.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 485 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 744 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides ''Sun, Moon, and Talia'', Basile included another variant of this Aarne-Thompson type, ''[[The Young Slave]]''. The Grimms also included a second, more distantly related one, ''[[The Glass Coffin]]''.&lt;ref name="Tales Similar to Sleeping Beauty"&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/other.html "Tales Similar to Sleeping Beauty"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Jacobs]] noted that the figure of the Sleeping Beauty was in common between this tale and the Gypsy tale ''[[The King of England and his Three Sons]]'', in his ''More English Fairy Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''More English Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/moreenglish/kingengland.html "The King of England and his Three Sons"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hostility of the king's mother to his new bride is repeated in the fairy tale ''[[The Six Swans]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 230 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also features ''[[The Twelve Wild Ducks]]'', where she is modified to be the king's stepmother. However, these tales omit the attempted cannibalism.

==Myth themes==
Some folklorists have analyzed ''Sleeping Beauty'' as indicating the replacement of the lunar year (with its thirteen months, symbolically depicted by the thirteen fairies) by the solar year (which has twelve, symbolically the invited fairies). The basic elements of the story can also be interpreted as a nature allegory: the princess represents nature, the wicked fairy godmother is winter, who puts the Court to sleep with pricks of frost until the prince (spring) cuts away the brambles with his sword (a sunbeam) to allow the Sun to awaken sleeping princess (nature).

'''''The Second Book of General Ignorance''''' is the fifth in a series of books based on the final round in the intellectual British [[panel game]] ''[[QI]]'', written by series-creator [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] and head-researcher [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|John Mitchinson]]. It is the second book to be based on the show's final round "[[QI#General Ignorance|General Ignorance]]", the first being ''[[The Book of General Ignorance]]'' first published in 2006. Like the original book, it is a [[trivia]] book aiming to address and correct the comprehensive and humiliating catalogue of all the misconceptions, mistakes and misunderstandings in 'common knowledge' — it is therefore known not as a 'General Knowledge' book, but as 'General Ignorance'.&lt;ref name="QI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qi.com/shop/secondbogi.php|title=The Second Book of General Ignorance|publisher=''[[QI]]''|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second, expanded edition called ''The Discreetly Plumper Second QI Book of General Ignorance'' was released on 4 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/buy/3072/the_discreetly_plumper_second_qi_book_of_general_ignorance_book/|title=The Discreetly Plumper Second QI Book of General Ignorance (Book)|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
The original ''Book of General Ignorance'' was first published in the UK on 4 October 2006.&lt;ref name="BCG"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Ian|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/buy/|title='QI' Merchandise|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book became a hit, becoming an [[Amazon.com]] bestseller in Christmas 2006, selling more copies in the last quarter of the year than any other book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wray|first=Richard|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/03/citynews.newmedia|title=Harry Potter set to work magic on Amazon|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=3 February 2007|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Book of General Ignorance'' became the fourth bestselling book in the history of Amazon.&lt;ref name="Stouter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qi.com/shop/stouter.php|title=The Book of General Ignorance (The Noticeably Stouter Edition)|publisher=''[[QI]]''|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the original book, a new, larger [[paperback]] edition of the book was published, entitled ''The Noticeably Stouter Edition'' in Christmas Day 2008 to celebrate the TV series moving from [[BBC Two]] to [[BBC One]],&lt;ref name="Stouter"/&gt; and an audiobook edition entitle ''The Sound of General Ignorance'' read by Lloyd and Mitchinson was released on 1 October 2008.&lt;ref name="BCG"/&gt; ''The Book of General Ignorance'' has been translated into 26 languages and has sold over 1.2 million copies. ''The Second Book of General Ignorance'', a sequel to the original was first published on 7 October 2010. A hardback version of ''The Noticeably Stouter Edition'' was published on the same day.&lt;ref name="BCG"/&gt;

==Structure==
Like the first ''Book of General Ignorance'', ''The Second Book of General Ignorance'' contains a list of questions, most of which previously appeared in episodes of ''QI''. Each question explains the correct answer, and usually attempts to show why people tend to make the wrong assumptions, or believe certain [[urban myth]]s. The book also features an introduction entitled "Forethought" written by the host of the TV series [[Stephen Fry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Fry |author2=[[John Lloyd (writer)|Lloyd, John]] |author3=[[John Mitchinson (researcher)|Mitchinson, John]]|title=The Second Book of General Ignorance|publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]|date=7 October 2010|pages=xiii-xvi|isbn=978-0-571-26965-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yoo memo.pdf|thumbnail|right|The January 9, 2002 Torture Memo as described.]]
A set of legal [[Memorandum|memoranda]] known as the "'''Torture Memos'''" were drafted by [[John Yoo]] as Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the United States and signed in August 2002 by Assistant Attorney General [[Jay Bybee|Jay S. Bybee]], head of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] of the [[United States Department of Justice]]. They advised the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[United States Department of Defense]], and the president on the use of [[enhanced interrogation techniques]]: mental and physical torment and coercion such as prolonged [[sleep deprivation]], binding in [[stress position]]s, and [[waterboarding]], and stated that such acts, widely regarded as torture, might be legally permissible under an expansive interpretation of presidential authority during the "[[War on Terror]]".

Following accounts of the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal in Iraq, one of the memos was leaked to the press in June 2004. [[Jack Goldsmith]], then head of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], had already withdrawn the Yoo memos and advised agencies not to rely on them. After Goldsmith was forced to resign because of his objections, [[Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft|Ashcroft]] issued a one paragraph opinion re-authorizing the use of torture.&lt;ref name = "Ashcroft memo"&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=C.I.A. Torture Report Live Blog |url=http://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/cia-torture-report-live-blog/?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news#the-one-paragraph-torture-memo-2 |quote= |work=[[New York Times]] |date= December 9, 2014 |accessdate=2014-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in December 2004, another head of OLC reaffirmed the original legal opinions.

In May 2005, the CIA requested new legal opinions about the interrogation techniques it was using. The OLC issued three memos that month, signed by [[Steven G. Bradbury]], ruling on the legality of the authorized techniques if agents followed certain constraints. In addition to these memos issued by the OLC to executive agencies, internal memos were written related to the use of torture in interrogation of detainees; for instance, in 2002 and 2003, [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[Secretary of Defense]], signed several memos authorizing "Special Interrogation Plans" for specific detainees held at Guantanamo Bay in an attempt to gain more information from them.

All of these memoranda have been the focus of considerable controversy over executive power, government practices, and the treatment of detainees during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]. They were repudiated by President [[Barack Obama]] on January 22, 2009, shortly after he took office.

==The Torture Memos==
The term "torture memos" was originally used to refer to three documents prepared by the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] at the United States Department of Justice and signed in August 2002: "Standards of Conduct for Interrogation under 18 U.S.C. sections 2340-2340A" and "Interrogation of al Qaeda" (both drafted by [[Jay Bybee]]), and an untitled letter from [[John Yoo]] to [[Alberto Gonzales]].

Since the initial revelation of these documents, other communications related to the use of torture to coerce or intimidate detainees during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] have been divulged. These include a December 2, 2002, internal [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] memo signed by [[Donald Rumsfeld]], then [[Secretary of Defense]], authorizing 17 techniques in a "Special Interrogation Plan" to be used against the detainee [[Mohammed al-Qahtani]];&lt;ref name=Nyt040621&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/21/world/the-reach-of-war-us-said-to-overstate-value-of-guantanamo-detainees.html |title=THE REACH OF WAR; U.S. Said to Overstate Value of Guantánamo Detainees |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 21, 2004 |first=Tim |last=Golden |authorlink=Tim Golden (journalist) |first2=Don |last2=Van Natta, Jr. |authorlink2=Don Van Natta Jr. |accessdate=July 31, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a March 13, 2003, legal opinion written by John Yoo of the Office of Legal Counsel, DOJ, and issued to the General Counsel of Defense five days before the U.S. [[invasion of Iraq]] started, concluding that federal laws related to use of torture and other abuse did not apply to agents interrogating foreigners overseas;&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/04/05/a-top-pentagon-lawyer-faces-a-senate-grilling-on-torture.html |title=A Top Pentagon Lawyer Faces a Senate Grilling On Torture |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=April 5, 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2013 |archivedate=January 15, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115012641/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/04/05/a-top-pentagon-lawyer-faces-a-senate-grilling-on-torture.html |first=Michael |last=Isikoff |authorlink=Michael Isikoff }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other DOD internal memos authorizing techniques for specific military interrogations of certain individual detainees.

In 2005, [[Alberto Gonzales]] testified before Congress that the CIA sought the 2002 opinion after having captured [[Abu Zubaydah]] in 2002, who was then believed to be a significant [[al-Qaeda]] figure who could provide important information to U.S. efforts to constrain and prevent terrorism.&lt;ref name="ZacharyCoile"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Gonzales-unflappable-in-6-hours-of-testimony-2706863.php |first=Zachary |last=Coile |title=Gonzales unflappable in 6 hours of testimony - Bush nominee says torture will not be tolerated |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=January 7, 2005 |accessdate=July 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were anxious to get as much information from Zubaydah as fast as possible. Questions by CIA officers over which tactics could be used on the detainee had spurred writing the torture memo,&lt;ref name="JohnstonAndRisen"&gt;David Johnston and James Risen [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E5DA1738F934A15755C0A9629C8B63 "The Reach Of War: The Interrogations; Aides Say Memo Backed Coercion Already In Use"], ''The New York Times'', June 27, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; which is reflected in the language of the memo; "You have asked for this advice in the course of conducting interrogations of Abu Zubaydah."&lt;ref name="August2002BybeeMemo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/pdf/OfficeofLegalCounsel_Aug2Memo_041609.pdf |first=Jay |last=Bybee |first2=John |last2=Yoo |title=Memorandum for John Rizzo Acting General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency: Interrogation of al Qaeda Operative |work=[[U.S. Department of Justice]], [[Office of Legal Counsel]] |date=August 1, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The memo's author, [[John Yoo]], acknowledged the memo authorized the "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]" used by the CIA in Zubaydah's interrogation.&lt;ref name="Rosen" /&gt; Yoo told an interviewer in 2007, "there was an urgency to decide so that valuable intelligence could be acquired from Abu Zubaydah, before further attacks could occur."&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt;

===Standards of Conduct for Interrogation under 18 U.S.C. sections 2340-2340A===
[[File:Bybee.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jay Bybee]], author of the original "Torture memo"]]
Jay Bybee, then Assistant U.S. Attorney General and head of the OLC, addressed a memorandum to Alberto Gonzales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sltrib.com/opinion/ci_12256286 |last=Irvine |first=David |title=LDS lawyers, psychologists had a hand in torture policies |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301090557/http://www.sltrib.com/opinion/ci_12256286 |archivedate=2012-03-01 |work=[[Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=29 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then [[Counsel to the President]], dated August 1, 2002, titled "Standards for Conduct for Interrogation under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2340-2340A". He was responding to the president's reported request for a legal opinion on the U.N. Convention Against Torture and 18 U.S.C. section 2340 and the interrogation of al Qaeda operatives.&lt;ref name="Bybee-2340"&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB127/02.08.01.pdf |title=Memorandum for Albert R. Gonzales, Counsel to the President Re: Standards of Conduct for Interrogation under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2340-2340A |first=Jay S. |last=Bybee |authorlink=Jay Bybee |p=11, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the primary "torture memo", which defines the Department of Justice's (DOJ) interpretation of torture. It is relied upon heavily by the subsequent "torture memos". It discusses the language of the torture statute (18 U.S.C. sections 2340-2340A) in detail in order to derive its definition of torture, states that "cruel, inhuman, or degrading" treatment is not torture according to that statute; and examines "possible defenses that would negate any claim that certain interrogation methods violate the statute".&lt;ref name="Bybee-2340" /&gt; It concludes that torture is only: extreme acts according to the Convention Against Torture; that severe pain (a requisite for this definition of torture) is "serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death"; that prolonged mental harm is harm that must last for "months or even years"; that "prosecution under Section 2340A may be barred because enforcement of the statute would represent an unconstitutional infringement of the President's authority to conduct war"; and that "under the current circumstances, necessity or self-defense may justify interrogation methods that might violate Section 2340A."&lt;ref name="Bybee-2340"/&gt;

====Part I====
Part one, in which the text and history of the U.S. torture statute (18 U.S.C. 2340-2340A) is examined, mainly addresses Bybee's interpretation of the definition of torture, including the definition of severe physical and mental pain or suffering.

In the first section, the memorandum states that the statute requires [[specific intent]] (the convention only requires general intent, but the "specific intent" language is found in the U.S. ratification reservation), and in citing case law, precedent states that specific intent means that "the infliction of [severe] pain must be the defendant's precise objective" and reminds the reader that "general intent" requires only actions that would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of the statute. The article concludes that, "even if the defendant knows that severe pain will result from his actions, if causing such harm is not his objective, he lacks the requisite specific intent". It suggests that a jury would likely act contrary to law (out of misunderstanding) by finding such an individual guilty regardless.

In the second section, the memo admits difficulty in finding any clear definition for the "severe pain or suffering" required by the torture statute (which is also required by the UN Convention). After examining the definition provided in various dictionaries, it concludes that "pain" is synonymous with "suffering" ("it is difficult to conceive of such suffering that would not involve severe physical pain"), and, selecting among the many definitions, the memo proposes that severe pain must be difficult to endure (some definitions quoted in the memo define severe pain as "inflicting discomfort"). In searching for a reference to the term in other U.S. statutes and law, it quotes from a health care law that defines "emergency condition", but merely mentions "severe pain" in passing. That statutory subsection, 8 U.S.C. section 1395w-22(d)(3)(B), defines an emergency condition as a condition "manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that [one] ... could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in placing the health of the individual ... in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part".

The memorandum concludes with a narrow definition of torture, that its "severe pain" must ''necessarily'' be pain associated with "death, organ failure, or serious impairment of body functions". It also states that the statute requires "prolonged mental harm" to accompany mental or physical pain, and that "prolonged" means a duration of months or years.

====Part II====
The memo discusses the Convention Against Torture (which the memo calls the "Torture Convention") and concludes that the convention makes a distinction between torture and "cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment", and that therefore torture is "only the most extreme acts", which the memo concludes, together with the ratifying reservations of the United States, confirms the interpretation of torture found in part one. It concludes that torture does not include "other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" because such language is found in a different article than the definition of torture, and because it appears that the convention does not intend to criminalize such action, but instead discourage it. The memo examines the ratification history, and cites U.S. case law stating that the executive branch's interpretation of the treaty "is to be accorded the greatest weight in ascertaining a treaty's intent and meaning". It finds in the congressional record that the Reagan administration understood torture to be "at the extreme end of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment", and that such treatment or punishment,&lt;!--restrictive or nonrestrictive?--&gt; which is not torture, to be "the cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States".

The understanding of the George H. W. Bush administration, which ratified the Convention, was different from that of the Reagan administration. It failed to promote any language regarding torture to be only "extremely cruel" behavior resulting in "excruciating and agonizing" pain, and instead, filed a reservation that quoted the text of the U.S. torture statute. The memorandum states that, on the basis of the conclusions reached in part one, "there was little difference between these two understandings and ... the further definition of mental pain or suffering merely sought remove [sic] the vagueness created by concept of 'agonizing and excruciating mental pain." The memo quotes a legal adviser of the Department of State, who stated that, "no higher standard was intended by the Reagan administration understanding than was present in the Convention or the Bush understanding".

The memo examines the negotiating history of the Convention, and finds that the U.S. originally proposed the terms "extremely severe pain or suffering", and that the U.K. proposed the terms, "extreme pain or suffering rather than ... severe pain or suffering", and states that "[u]ltimately, in choosing the phrase "severe pain", the parties concluded that this phrase "sufficient[ly] ... convey[ed] the idea that only acts of a certain gravity shall ... constitute torture", rather than all acts that are inhumane and degrading. It concludes that the "ratification history and negotiating history [of the convention] all confirm that Section 2340A reaches only the ''most heinous'' acts", and thus implies that this confirms its definition of torture in part one, section two of this memo.

====Part III====
Part three summarizes various techniques within the case law to outline the kind of conduct that the courts have previously found to be torture. The memo states that, through an analysis of those cases, "courts are likely to take a totality-of-the-circumstances approach, and will look to an entire course of conduct, to determine whether certain acts will violate Section 2340A." After reviewing a number of torture-related cases in the U.S., in which victims were subjected to beatings, burning, electric shocks, and the threat of such actions, it states that, "we believe that interrogation techniques would have to be similar to these in their extreme nature and in the type of harm caused to violate the law." It does discuss one case in which the federal court states that an isolated incident, such as a single blow to the stomach, is sufficient alone to be torture, but the memo states that this is in error, because "a single blow does not reach the requisite level of severity [to constitute torture]." It later says that this conclusion is "based on our interpretation of the criminal statute" found in section two of part one of this memo. Although the memo states that nowhere in the case law can a clear interpretation or definition of torture be found, because the cases it did find were all regarding extreme acts, it concludes that this confirms the memo's definition of torture.{{clarify|date=February 2013}}

====Part IV====
Part four examines international case law regarding torture, and concludes that while there are many methods that might be cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, "they do not produce pain or suffering of the necessary intensity to meet the definition of torture." It discusses two cases:
* A case in the European Court of Human Rights that found that wall standing, hooding, subjection to noise, sleep deprivation, and deprivation of food and drink, used in combination for a long period fall into the category of inhuman treatment, but not torture, since "they did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture."
* A case from the Israel Supreme Court that does not mention torture at all, but only cruel and inhumane treatment, which the memo states is evidence that the actions addressed by that court were not torture.

====Part V====
Part five of the memo analyzes constitutional law as to whether the statute passed by Congress infringes on the powers of the president to conduct war, and concludes that it is unconstitutional. It states specifically that the nation was "in the middle of a war in which the nation [had] already suffered a direct attack", and that limiting interrogations would encroach on the president's ability to prevent future attacks. The memo summarizes the terrorist threat from [[al Qaeda]], including the September 11 attacks, and states that interrogation of al Qaeda operatives led to the stopping of [[José Padilla (prisoner)|Jose Padilla]]'s planned attack. It provides case law supporting its position of the executive branch to conduct war.{{clarify|date=February 2013}} It also argues that prosecution of individuals following orders from the president, even if in violation of Section 2340A, should not be possible, since it would impinge upon the president's powers as commander-in-chief.

====Part VI====
Part six of the memo is titled "Defenses" and concludes that "under the current circumstances, necessity or self-defense may justify interrogation methods that might violate Section 2340A." This is provided as a fail safe argument, because the author believes that, according to his view in part five of the memo, prosecution would probably be impossible.

====Conclusion====
In the conclusion section of the memorandum, Bybee summarizes what is viewed as the most important conclusions of the memorandum, namely the definition of torture, the possible unconstitutionality of the torture statute as applied to the president, and the legal justification of necessity or self-defense for any acts that might be torture.

===Interrogation of al Qaeda operative===
Jay Bybee addressed a memorandum to [[John A. Rizzo]], then the acting General Counsel of the CIA, dated August 1, 2002, in response to the CIA's reported request for legal opinion on 18 U.S.C. section 2340 (the torture statute) as applied to the interrogation of [[Abu Zubaydah]].&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, J. (2002). [http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/70967/00355_020801_004display.pdf Memorandum for J. Rizzo... [Re:&amp;#93; Interrogation of al Qaeda Operative] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718093742/http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/70967/00355_020801_004display.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}. United States, Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel. Accessed September 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There was much administration opposition to releasing this memorandum to the public, and the first release was almost completely redacted.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/70966/00355_020801_003display.pdf this copy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718093813/http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/70966/00355_020801_003display.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It summarizes the facts regarding [[Abu Zubaydah]] and his resistance to interrogation, as related by the CIA. It summarizes the various methods of physical and psychological coercion to be used by the CIA against Zubaydah (see next section, Part I for details). It discusses the background of Zubaydah and the possible mental effects from such abuse, the background of the consultant to be assisting, and the details of the proposed coercive actions. It then applies the U.S. torture statute (18 U.S.C. section 2340-2340A) to each of these proposed actions. It concludes that none of these methods, individually or simultaneously would be considered torture according to law.

====Part I====
The first part says that the advice provided in this memorandum applies only to the facts at hand regarding [[Abu Zubaydah]], and that the conclusions of the memorandum may change given different facts. Those facts, according to the top secret memorandum, are that Abu Zubaydah was being held by the United States, and that, "[t]he interrogation team is certain that he has additional information that he refuses to divulge" regarding terrorist groups in the U.S. or [[Saudi Arabia]] planning attacks in the U.S. or overseas. It does not give any specifics or note what makes this conclusion certain. The memorandum states that it appears that the suspect has grown accustomed to their interrogation techniques, and refers to the threat of a possible attack in the United States by unknown individuals. Without further discussion, the fact summary concludes that the "high level of threat [the reader] believe[s] now exists" is why advice regarding further techniques is being sought. Continuing to summarize the facts, the memorandum summarizes the characteristics of the professionals present during the proposed interrogation techniques, and summarizes those coercive methods. It states that the purpose of these methods will be to "convince Zubaydah that the only way he can influence his surrounding environment is through cooperation". The memorandum describes in detail each of the techniques proposed as generally used, including attention grasp, [[walling]], [[facial hold]], insult slap, cramped confinement (large and small and with and without an insect), [[wall standing]], stress positions, sleep deprivation, and [[waterboarding]]. It clarifies that a medical expert will always be present "to prevent severe physical or mental harm[.]"

====Part II====
Part two of this memorandum goes into great detail how the techniques described in part one will be applied in [[Abu Zubaydah]]'s case. It describes the CIA practices, and reminds them how those practices are applied "to ensure that no prolonged mental harm would result from the use of these proposed procedures". This section reviews how no appreciable harm has ever resulted from the application of these techniques on U.S. military personnel, and that these techniques have the approval of the government medical experts who train in the application and subversion of these techniques. It summarizes the psychological profile provided of the subject, including his involvement in high-level terrorist activities [Note: as believed at the time, but found to be wrong] {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} with al Qaeda and his background training operatives in [[resistance to interrogation]], as well as his radical thinking, such as the fact that he "has stated during interviews that he thinks of any activity outside of jihad as "silly". It states that after substantial research of the individual's background, behavior and journal entries, interrogators believe he does not suffer from any psychological disorders or disturbances. This section concludes by emphasizing the potential value of the information he could provide, as well as his likely strong ability to resist standard interrogation techniques.

====Part III====
This section provides legal analysis of the U.S. anti-torture law (18 U.S.C. section 2340-2340A) and the application of each of the proposed techniques in this particular situation. After summarizing the law, it analyses the elements of the offense of torture (inflicting severe pain or suffering), and the specific (or criminal) intent required by the statute for the offense.

===Letter from John Yoo to Alberto Gonzales===
[[File:John Yoo 2012 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|John Yoo, author of several memoranda]]
[[John Yoo]], then Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], addressed a memorandum to [[Alberto Gonzales]], then the counsel to the president, dated August 1, 2002, in response to Gonzales' reported request for legal opinion on whether interrogation methods used on [[al Qaeda]] operatives would be in violation of the [[U.N. Convention Against Torture]], and whether such actions could be the basis for prosecution in the [[International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoo, John C. (August 1, 2002). [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB127/020801.pdf Response to Alberto Gonzales' Request for Views on Legality of Interrogation Techniques]. United States, Department of Justice, Office of the Legal Counsel. Accessed September 4, 2009. Also at [http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/70965/00355_020801_002display.pdf this alternative link] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718093659/http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/70965/00355_020801_002display.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}. Accessed September 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter is intended to supplement the [[Standards of Conduct for Interrogation under 18 U.S.C. sections 2340-2340A|memorandum]] sent to Gonzales the same day by Jay Bybee, to which it occasionally refers. The letter concludes that the interpretation of the Department of Justice of 18 U.S.C. s. 2340, which enacted into U.S. law the Convention Against Torture, does not conflict with the Convention because the United States recorded its reservations upon ratification. It also concludes that "actions taken as part of the interrogation ... cannot fall within the jurisdiction of the ICC, although it would be impossible to control the actions of a rogue prosecutor or judge." The letter explains the Department of Justice's interpretation of s. 2340-2340A, their interpretation of the Convention Against Torture as applied to the United States and the status of the U.S. reservations, and explains its position on the possibility of prosecution by the ICC.

====Part I====
In the explanation of the definition of torture according to 18 U.S.C. section 2340, it emphasizes the need for the pain to be severe, although it does not attempt to define what "severe pain or suffering" means. It also emphasizes that the individual inflicting such pain must have "specific intention to inflict severe pain or suffering". The letter explains section 2340's definition of "severe mental pain or suffering", and reminds the reader of the need for "prolonged mental harm".

====Part II====
As the memo quotes from the definition of torture in the Convention Against Torture, it compares that definition to the one found in the U.S. statute, and analyzes the effect of the ratification reservation of the U.S. to the Convention. That reservation was mainly regarding Article One of the Convention, which defines torture, but it also states that the U.S. refuses to accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice regarding conformity to the Convention. The memo notes that in the reservation, the U.S. added language of "specific intent" (as opposed to the "general intent" in the Convention), and it explained what was meant by mental pain or suffering (as in the U.S. statute). Commenting on the specificity of the reservation and statute regarding mental pain or suffering, the memo says, "this understanding ensured that mental torture would rise to a severity comparable to that required in the context of physical torture." The memo explains treaty law, which states that the U.S. is bound to the treaty only as modified by the reservation, and points out that the language of the reservation is "nearly identical" to that of 18 U.S.C. s. 2340. Therefore, it states, if the interrogation conduct did not violate the U.S. statute, it would also not violate the U.S. obligations under the Convention. While the letter states there is little substantive difference between the definition of torture in the text of the statute (or reservation) and in the Convention, most of the material in this part of the memo is dedicated to explaining why the reservation to the Convention is valid and cannot be overturned. The memo closes this section reminding the reader of the refusal of the U.S. to accept the jurisdiction of the ICC, and that, "[a]lthough the Convention creates a [c]ommittee to monitor compliance, [the committee] can only conduct studies and has no enforcement powers."

====Part III====
In discussing the possible prosecution by the ICC, the memo states that the U.S. did not ratify the necessary treaty for such jurisdiction (the [[Rome Statute]]). The memo further argues that even if the ICC were to claim jurisdiction, "interrogation of an al Qaeda operative could not constitute a crime under the Rome Statute", since it would not involve the "widespread and systematic attack directed against any civilian population" and would not be considered a [[war crime]]. Yoo writes that, in his opinion, "[t]he United States' campaign against al Qaeda is an attack on a non-state terrorist organization, not a civilian population." He also reiterates President W. Bush's "assertion" that "neither members of the al Qaeda terrorist network nor [[Taliban]] soldiers were entitled to the legal status of [[prisoners of war]] under the [Geneva Convention]," and therefore planned interrogation methods would not constitute a violation of the Geneva Convention, or war crime. This interpretation of the Geneva Convention was sent in memos, despite objections by attorneys and the Secretary of the Department of State,&lt;ref&gt;Powell, C. (January 26, 2002).

====Conclusion====
Yoo concludes the letter by stating, "It is possible that an ICC official would ignore the clear limitations imposed by the Rome Statute, or at least disagree with the President's interpretation of [the Geneva Convention]. Of course, the problem of the 'rogue prosecutor' is not limited to questions about the interrogation of al Qaeda operatives, but is a potential risk for any number of actions that have been undertaken during the Afghanistan campaign... We cannot predict the political actions of international institutions."

===March 14, 2003, Memo from John Yoo to DOD re: Interrogation methods overseas===
After Bybee was confirmed in his appointment as a federal judge on March 13, John Yoo was the acting head of the OLC. He wrote a memo to the DOD on March 14, 2003, concluding that "federal laws against torture, assault and maiming would not apply to the overseas interrogation of terror suspects".&lt;ref name="Haynes"/&gt; This was five days before the [[Iraq War]]. The legal opinion had been requested by [[William J. Haynes]], General Counsel of the Department of Defense. Yoo was acting head of OLC for several months before [[Jack Goldsmith]] was approved for the position. In 2008, leaders of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees concluded that the memo was used by the DOD to "justify harsh interrogation practices on terror suspects at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantánamo Bay]]" and the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse.&lt;ref name="Haynes"/&gt;

==OLC head Jack Goldsmith's withdrawal of the torture memos==
After Bybee resigned from the Department of Justice in March 2003 for a federal judgeship in Nevada, Attorney General [[John Ashcroft|Ashcroft]] vetoed the White House's choice of John Yoo as his successor. Yoo was acting head of OLC for several months.

[[Jack Goldsmith]] was appointed to succeed Bybee as head of the Office of Legal Counsel and took office in October 2003. A professor at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] before government service, he had previously been legal adviser to [[William J. Haynes, II|William Haynes]], the General Counsel of the Department of Defense.

In the spring of 2004, the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib prisoner scandal]] broke into the news, and in June 2004, the Bybee memo was leaked to the press.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/magazine/09rosen.html |first=Jeffrey |last=Rosen |authorlink=Jeffrey Rosen |title=Conscience of a Conservative |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=September 9, 2007 |accessdate=16 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on his review of the Torture Memos, Goldsmith concluded that they were legally defective and had to be withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt; In his book ''The Terror Presidency'' (2007), Goldsmith called them "cursory and one-sided legal arguments". Goldsmith says he had decided to revoke what the CIA had been calling its "golden shield" against prosecution six months before the abuses at Abu Ghraib were revealed. He was at work on the problem when the scandal and the leak of the memo precipitated the final decision.&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt;

When Goldsmith brought his decision to White House Counsel [[Alberto Gonzales]] and Vice Presidential Counsel [[David Addington]], Goldsmith wrote, Gonzales seemed "puzzled and slightly worried", while Addington "was just plain mad".&lt;ref name="GoldsmithBook"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Goldsmith |authorlink=Jack Goldsmith |title=[[The Terror Presidency (book)|The Terror Presidency: Law and Judgement Inside the Bush Administration]] |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|W. W. Norton]] |location=[[New York City, New York]] |year=2007 |pages=149; 165–66 |isbn=978-0-393-06550-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldsmith submitted his resignation at the same time.&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt;

Reflecting afterward on the Torture Memos as a cautionary tale, Goldsmith wrote in his 2007 memoir:
&lt;blockquote&gt;How could this have happened? How could OLC have written opinions that, when revealed to the world weeks after the Abu Ghraib scandal broke, made it seem as though the administration was giving official sanction to torture, and brought such dishonor on the United States, the Bush administration, the Department of Justice, and the CIA? How could its opinions reflect such bad judgement, be so poorly reasoned, and have such terrible tone?... The main explanation is fear [of a new attack]. Fear explains why OLC pushed the envelope. And in pushing the envelope, OLC took shortcuts in its opinion-writing procedures.&lt;ref name="GoldsmithBook"/&gt;{{rp|165–6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Goldsmith's tenure at OLC was ten months. He resigned he said, for several reasons but the main one was that, as a result of withdrawing the Torture Memos, "important people inside the administration had come to question my ... reliability."&lt;ref name="GoldsmithBook"/&gt;{{rp|161}} He had been unable to finish replacement legal opinions, so that task fell to his successors. But, later that year, an opinion was issued by his successor at the OLC, that changed the very narrow definition of torture from the original legal opinions of the Bush administration on this topic.

==Revised opinion, December 2004==
The superseding OLC opinion of 30 December 2004, "Definition of Torture Under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2340–2340A"&lt;ref name=Levin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/2004/12/31/op-olc-v028-p0297_0.pdf |title=Definition of Torture Under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2340–2340A |accessdate=22 December 2014 |first=Daniel |last=Levin |authorlink=Daniel Levin (attorney) |date=30 December 2004 |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Daniel Levin (attorney)|Daniel Levin]], Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, rolled back the narrow definition of torture in the memos. He noted, "[w]hile we have identified various disagreements with the August 2002 Memorandum, we have reviewed this Office's prior opinions addressing issues involving treatment of detainees and do not believe that any of their conclusions would be different under the standards set forth in this memorandum."&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jane |last=Mayer |authorlink=Jane Mayer |title=[[The Dark Side (book)|Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals]] |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |location=[[Garden City, New York]] |year=2008 |pages=152–153 |isbn=0-385-52639-3 |oclc=229309144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional related memos==
In 2005, CIA lawyers reviewed videotapes of interrogations of detainees. Increasingly concerned about the legal implications of their practices, [[John Rizzo]], then Acting General Counsel of the agency, requested the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, for new legal opinions on the use of these techniques. [[Steven G. Bradbury]] as head of the OLC signed three memos issued in May 2005 advising the CIA that a limited set of interrogation techniques could be used, according to certain constraints.&lt;ref name=memo10May2005-1&gt;{{cite web

The OLC said that the techniques did not violate the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention Against Torture]], as ratified by the United States in 1994. That year, the CIA [[2005 CIA interrogation tapes destruction|destroyed the videotapes of the interrogations]].

Bradbury authored an additional memo dated July 2007, seeking to reconcile the interrogation techniques with new legal developments, including ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'', as well as intervening legislation such as the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] and the December 2005 [[Detainee Treatment Act]]. The 2007 memo provided legal authorization and OLC approval for a more limited set of actions for use when interrogating high-value detainees.

==Revised opinions, 2009==
Near the end of the Bush administration, Bradbury signed two memoranda for the files, explaining that during his tenure, OLC had determined that certain legal propositions previously stated in ten OLC opinions issued between 2001 and 2003 concerning executive power in the War on Terror no longer reflected the views of OLC. His memos said the 10 earlier opinions "should not be treated as authoritative for any purpose" and further explained that some of the underlying opinions had been withdrawn or superseded and that "caution should be exercised" by the Executive Branch "before relying in other respects" on the other opinions that had not been superseded or withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;

==President Obama's repudiation of the torture memos==
Two days after taking office on January 20, President [[Barack Obama]] by Executive Order, released January 22, 2009, rescinded all the previous OLC guidance about "detention or the interrogation of detained individuals" and directed that no government agency may rely on ''any'' of the OLC opinions on that topic between 2001 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Executive Order: Interrogation|date=22 January 2009|accessdate=5 January 2011|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-01-22-execorder-interrogation_N.htm |newspaper=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had declared shortly before taking office "under my administration the United States does not torture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama Names Intel Picks; vows no torture|date=9 January 2009|accessdate=1 March 2010|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28574408/|publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, President Obama released redacted versions of the Torture Memos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/16/bush-torture-memos-releas_n_187867.html |first=Sam |last=Stein |title=Bush Torture Memos Released |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=16 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, he said that his administration would prosecute neither the authors of the memos nor those CIA or DOD personnel or contractors who carried out the acts described in them in the belief they were legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2009/04/obama-adminis-1.html |title=Obama Administration: No Prosecution of Officials for Bush-Era Torture Policy |work=[[ABC News]] |first=George |last=Stephanopoulos |authorlink=George Stephanopoulos |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421030712/http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2009/04/obama-adminis-1.html |archivedate=April 21, 2009 |date=April 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bybee was, however, investigated by the Justice Department's [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] (see below).&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

[[Jack Goldsmith]], who succeeded Bybee as head of the Office of Legal Counsel, withdrew the torture memos weeks before resigning in June 2004.

David Luban, a law professor at Georgetown Law School, testified before Congress on May 13, 2009, stating that the memos were "an ethical train wreck" and had been drafted to "reverse engineer" a defense for illegal actions already committed.&lt;ref name="BobbyGhosh"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1898125,00.html |first=Bobby |last=Ghosh |title=Partisan Passions Dominate Interrogation Hearings |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 13, 2009 |accessdate=July 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OPR investigation===
In 2009, the Justice Department's [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] reviewed the work of the principal author [[John Yoo]], now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley; and signatory Jay Bybee, now a federal judge, to determine whether the advice given "was consistent with the professional standards that apply to Department of Justice attorneys".&lt;ref name=NW184801&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/184801 |title=A Torture Report Could Spell Big Trouble For Bush Lawyers |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-13|mdy}} |first=Michael |last=Isikoff |authorlink=Michael Isikoff |date={{Date|2009-02-14|mdy}} |work=[[Newsweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Yoo was later harshly criticized by the Department of Justice for failing to cite legal precedent and existing case law when drafting his memos.&lt;ref name="DOJReportYoo"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pubrecord.org/torture/226/doj-report-says-yoos-torture-memo-failed-to-cite-supreme-court-case/ |authorlink=Jason Leopold |first=Jason |last=Leopold |title=DOJ Report Says Yoo’s Torture Memo Failed to Cite Supreme Court Case |work=The Public Record |date=February 22, 2009 |accessdate=July 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the 2009 DOJ report chastises Yoo for failing to cite ''[[Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer]],'' a seminal case on the powers of the Executive in times of war.&lt;ref name="DOJReportYoo"/&gt; In its 261-page final report, the OPR concluded that the legal opinions that justified waterboarding and other interrogation tactics for use on Al Qaeda suspects in United States custody amounted to professional misconduct.&lt;ref name=OPR /&gt;{{rp|254}} The report said that Yoo in particular "knowingly failed to provide a thorough, objective, and candid interpretation of the law", and recommended referral of him to the Bar for disciplinary action.&lt;ref name=OPR&gt;{{cite report |author=Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility |author-link=Office of Professional Responsibility |date=July 29, 2009 |title=Investigation into the Office of Legal Counsel's Memoranda Concerning Issues Relating to the Central Intelligence Agency's Use of "Enhanced Interrogation Techniques" on Suspected Terrorists |url=https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/natsec/opr20100219/20090729_OPR_Final_Report_with_20100719_declassifications.pdf |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |access-date=May 29, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|251-254}}

On February 26, 2010, ''The New York Times'' reported that the Justice Department had revealed that numerous e-mail files were missing in relation to the decisions of that period and had not been available to the OPR investigation.&lt;ref name="nyt2010missingfiles"/&gt; These included most of Yoo's e-mail records, as well as a "month's worth of e-mail files from the summer of 2002 for [[Patrick F. Philbin|Patrick Philbin]], another political appointee Justice Department lawyer who worked on the interrogation opinions. Those missing e-mail messages came during a period when two of the critical interrogation memos were being prepared."&lt;ref name="nyt2010missingfiles"/&gt;

===Criticism===
The August 1, 2002, memo has been widely criticized, including within the Bush administration. [[Colin Powell]], the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], strongly opposed the invalidation of the Geneva Conventions,&lt;ref name="newsweek-memos"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Isikoff |authorlink=Michael Isikoff |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/105057 |title=Memos Reveal War Crimes Warnings |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=May 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Alberto J. Mora|Alberto Mora]], [[General Counsel]] of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], campaigned internally against what he saw as the "catastrophically poor legal reasoning" and dangerous extremism of Yoo's legal opinions.&lt;ref name="mayer"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New Yorker]] |first=Jane |last=Mayer |authorlink=Jane Mayer |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/02/27/060227fa_fact |title=The Memo: How an Internal Effort to Ban the Abuse and Torture of Detainees was Thwarted |date=February 27, 2006 |accessdate=April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Philip D. Zelikow]], the former State Department legal adviser to [[Condoleezza Rice]], testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It seemed to me that the OLC interpretation of U.S. Constitutional Law in this area was strained and indefensible. I could not imagine any federal court in America agreeing that the entire CIA program could be conducted and it would not violate the American Constitution.&lt;ref name="Eviatar"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zelikow alleged that Bush administration officials not only ignored his memos on the subject, but attempted to destroy them.&lt;ref name="Eviatar"&gt;{{cite news

In June 2004, the memo was rescinded by [[Jack Goldsmith]], who had been appointed in October 2003 to lead the OLC.&lt;ref name=NW184801/&gt; He had earlier advised agencies not to follow the three August 2002 memos. He called the memo "deeply flawed" and "sloppily reasoned".&lt;ref name=NW184801/&gt; In discussing the issues in 2007, after publishing his memoir about his service in the Bush administration, Goldsmith asserted that he "hadn't determined the underlying techniques were illegal".&lt;ref name=NW42694&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/42694 |title='The Law Required It' Former Justice Department lawyer Jack Goldsmith explains why he fought the White House's aggressive legal maneuvers in the fight against terror |accessdate={{Date|2009-03-29|mdy}} |author=Daniel Klaidman |work=[[Newsweek]] |date={{Date|2007-09-08|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues, "I wasn't in the position to make an independent ruling on the other techniques. I certainly didn't think they were unlawful, but I couldn't get an opinion that they were lawful either."&lt;ref name=NW42694/&gt;

In 2004, the journalist [[Robert Scheer]] asked if Bybee's appointment to a lifetime job as a federal judge was reward for writing the torture memo. In his column in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Scheer wrote, "Was it as a reward for such bold legal thinking that only months later Bybee was appointed to one of the top judicial benches in the country?" He wrote, "The Bybee memo is not some oddball exercise in moral relativism but instead provides the most coherent explanation of how this [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]] came to believe that to assure freedom and security at home and abroad, it should ape the tactics of brutal dictators."&lt;ref name="LAtimes2004-06-15"&gt;

In 2005, testimony to Congress, [[Harold Hongju Koh]], dean of the [[Yale Law School]] and former Assistant Secretary for Human Rights in the [[Bill Clinton administration]], called the 1 August 2002 memo "perhaps the most clearly erroneous legal opinion I have ever read", which "grossly overreads the president's constitutional power".&lt;ref name=FL20050114&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dean/20050114.html |title=The Torture Memo By Judge Jay S.

On March 9, 2006, after emerging from a closed talk at [[Harvard Law School]] sponsored by the student chapter of the [[Federalist Society]], Bybee was confronted by around thirty-five protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=512052 |title=Human Rights Groups Protest Law School Speech |accessdate={{Date|2009-03-29|mdy}} |first=Paras D. |last=Bhayani |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date={{Date|2006-03-13|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Malcolm Nance wrote an entry on the Small Wars Journal Blog named "Waterboarding is Torture... Period." Nance was a US Navy counterterrorism specialist and testified before a House judiciary subcommittee concerning US torture practices. He may not have a law degree or wield political power, but he has "personally led, witnessed and supervised waterboarding of hundreds of people" during his stint as a Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) School instructor. The final paragraph of his entry asks that "Congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle... stand up for American values and clearly specify that coercive interrogation using the waterboard is torture and, except for limited examples of training our service members and intelligence officers, it should be stopped completely and finally - oh, and this time without a Presidential signing statement reinterpreting the law" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ehrenberg |first1=John |last2=McSherry |first2=J. |last3=Sanchez |first3=Jose |last4=Sayej |first4=Caroleen |date=2010 |title=The Iraq Papers |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=425–427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Kmiec, a law professor at [[Pepperdine University]], has stated that ultimately the memo "caused no long-term legal damage because it was redrafted and is not legally binding".&lt;ref name=LADJ&gt;{{cite news |work=Los Angeles Daily Journal |date={{Date|2007-10-03|mdy}} |pages=1 |title=Freethinking Judge Brings Controversial Past}}{{Verify source|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 19, 2009, an editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that Bybee is "unfit for a job that requires legal judgment and a respect for the Constitution" and called for Bybee's [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment from the federal bench]].&lt;ref name="depraved"&gt;{{cite news

In addressing reports of his regrets, he said in the same article that he would have done some things differently, such as clarifying and sharpening the analysis of some of his answers, to help the public better understand in retrospect the basis for his conclusions.&lt;ref name="NYT_2009-04-29"&gt;{{Cite news

In an April 25, 2009, ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, Patrick J. Leahy (D-VT), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is quoted: "If the Bush administration and Mr. Bybee had told the truth, he never would have been confirmed," adding that "the decent and honorable thing for him to do would be to resign [from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit]".&lt;ref name="WaPo2009-04-25" /&gt; Four days later, Senator Leahy sent a letter to Judge Jay S. Bybee inviting him to testify before the Judiciary Committee in connection with his role in writing legal memoranda authorizing the use of harsh interrogation techniques while serving as the Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC).&lt;ref name="LeahyLetter"&gt;

Judge [[Betty Binns Fletcher|Betty Fletcher]], a member of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] for 30 years until her death in 2012, is quoted from a statement regarding Bybee:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He is a moderate conservative, very bright and always attentive to the record and the applicable law. I have not talked to other judges about his memo on torture, but to me it seems completely out of character and inexplicable that he would have signed such a document.&lt;ref name="NYT_2009-04-29"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Uthingo Management (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Trade and Industry'''''&lt;ref&gt;[2007] 2 All SA 649 (T).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African administrative law]], in which the applicant sought an order interdicting the second and third respondents from operating a national lottery in South Africa, pending the final determination of the applicant’s review application.

In the second part of the application, the applicant sought the review and setting aside of the first respondent’s award to a third party of a licence to conduct the national lottery.

The court, having considered the evidence, made the following observations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My view is that for the Minister of Trade and Industry to comply with the requirements of section 13(2)(b)(iv) and (3)(b) of the Lotteries Act [... he] must at least be aware or have had information about all the shareholders of the third respondent and all individual shareholders in the entities which constitute the third respondent. Failure to secure the said information will not enable the Minister to comply with the provisions of the Lotteries Act.&lt;ref&gt;665.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Lotteries Board, when advising the Minister, as required by section 10(a) of the Lotteries Act, performs an administrative act, as the Minister might act in accordance with their recommendation. Furthermore, the court found, when advising the Minister, the Board is bound to apply principles of openness and transparency. Failure on their part to consider all the relevant and material information prior to advising the Minister is also subject to judicial review, as provided for in section 6(2) of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act.

There were serious shortcomings, the court held, in the investigation the Board carried out and consequently in the memorandum it presented to the Minister. The Board did not investigate, and its memorandum did not contain information (or, at least, information which was material to the Minister and the recommendation) about the individual shareholders of the entities that constituted both the applicant and the third respondent.

The Minister and the National Lotteries Board failed to consider or take into account mandatory and material information prescribed by section 13 of the Lotteries Act, namely the shareholders in the entities which constitute the applicant.

The decision to award the licence to [[Gidani]] was accordingly set aside.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1768">The '''Welsh Manuscripts Society''', also known as the '''Society for the Publication of Ancient Welsh Manuscripts''', was an organisation formed in [[Abergavenny]], [[Wales]], in 1837.&lt;ref name="Stephens1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Meic Stephens|title=The New Companion to the Literature of Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WoMYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=24 October 2012|date=23 September 1998|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=978-0-7083-1383-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was led by prominent members of the clergy and other notables including [[Taliesin Williams]]. It had the purpose of collecting, studying, and, as a [[text publication society]], of publishing manuscripts relating to the ancient [[poetry]], [[prose]] and [[historiography]] of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and Wales.&lt;ref name="Miles1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dillwyn Miles|title=The Secret of the Bards of the Isle of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJZiAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=24 October 2012|year=1992|publisher=Gwasg Dinefwr Press|isbn=978-0-9519926-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its final publication was ''Barddas; or, a collection of original documents, illustrative of the theology, wisdom and usages of the Bardo-Druidic system of the isle of Britain'', edited and translated by Rev. [[John Williams (Ab Ithel)]]. The first volume appeared in 1862; and the second volume, in an incomplete form, in 1874.
