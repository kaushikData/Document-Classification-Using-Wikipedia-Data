==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* Jack Bartholomew retained his English Championship title but no fights involving him are recorded in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/bartholomew-jack.htm Cyber Boxing Zone]. Retrieved on 6 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* With inter-county fixtures not being played again until 1825, the records show a considerable increase in matches played by town clubs rather than county teams.
'''England'''
* Most runs&lt;ref name="cards"&gt;Note that scorecards created in the 18th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the '''known''' totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk]] 369
* Most wickets&lt;ref name="cards"/&gt; – [[Thomas Boxall]] 42

==[[Horse racing]]==

}}

The '''[[Eredivisie|Netherlands Football League Championship]] 1891/1892''' was contested by six teams from the cities [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Haarlem]] and [[Rotterdam]]. The teams participated in the competition that would later be called ''Eerste Klasse West''. But since the western football district of the Netherlands was the only one to have a competition at the time, it could be regarded as a national championship. [[RAP (football club)|RAP]] won the championship.

==New entrants==
*[[HV Victoria|Victoria Rotterdam]]
*[[VVA/Spartaan|VVA]] returned after one season of absence
*[[RC en VV Rotterdam]] was the result of a merger between last seasons competitors ''Olympia Rotterdam'' and ''Concordia''

}}The '''1948 Australian Grand Prix''' was a motor race held at the [[RAAF Williams|Point Cook Aerodrome]],&lt;ref name=Programme&gt;Programme, Australian Grand Prix, Australia Day 26 January 1948, Point Cook Aerodrome&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] base at [[Point Cook]], just outside [[Melbourne]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] on [[Australia Day]], 26 January 1948. It was staged over 42 laps of a 3.85 kilometre circuit utilizing the runways and service roads of the base.&lt;ref name="Galpin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galpin|first1=Darren|title=Point Cook|url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/tracks/pointcoo.html|website=GEL Motorsport Information Page|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total race distance was 162 kilometres. The race was organised by the Light Car Club of Australia and was sanctioned by the [[Australian Automobile Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Motor Sports, 15 December 1947, page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The race was the thirteenth [[Australian Grand Prix]] and the first not to be held on a public road circuit. It was staged as a handicap event with the first car starting 18 minutes before the last.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt; Conditions were oppressive, with the temperature topping 100 degrees Fahrenheit by mid-morning, along with hot winds buffeting the exposed pits on the start/finish straight.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Terry|title=Fast Tracks - Australia's Motor Racing Circuits: 1904-1995|date=1995|publisher=Turton &amp; Armstrong|location=Wahroonga, NSW|isbn=0908031556|page=134}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The overpowering heat, plus the bumpy concrete-slab surface of the runways, took a heavy toll on the competing cars. As well as mechanical retirements, several drivers had to retire due to heat exhaustion.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; 

Prominent motorcycle racer Frank Pratt won the race driving a [[BMW 328]]. Alf Najar finished second driving an [[MG TB]] Special with Dick Bland placed third in a George Reed constructed [[Ford flathead V8 engine|Ford V8]] special. Bland was also awarded the prize for setting the fastest time.&lt;ref name=Argus&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22537213 ''Motor-cyclist wins Grand Prix in BMW'', The Argus, Tuesday, 27 January 1948, page 12, trove.nla.gov.au] Retrieved on 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

His brother, [[yokozuna (sumo)|Yokozuna]] [[Takanohana]] returns from a back injury and is runner-up on 13–2. Yokozuna [[Akebono Taro|Akebono]] and ozeki [[Musashimaru]] take third place with 12–3.

[[Dejima Takeharu|Dejima]] wins the [[juryo]] [[yusho]].

===March===
*In Osaka, Takanohana takes his 16th championship after an unusual four way playoff also involving Akebono, Musashimaru and [[maegashira]] 1 [[Kaio Hiroyuki|Kaio]], after all finish on 12–3. He defeats Kaio and then Akebono, who had eliminated Musashimaru. Kaio, who had upset both Takanohana and Akebono earlier in the tournament, is awarded the Outstanding Performance prize. Dejima receives Technique and Fighting Spirit prizes for scoring eleven wins in his top division debut. [[Tamakasuga]] also receives a share of the Fighting Spirit prize. Wakanohana withdraws early after tearing a muscle in his right leg. [[Terao]] is also forced to withdraw after breaking his big toe, ending a run of 1359 consecutive bouts from his debut in 1979. [[Chiyotaikai]] wins the juryo championship. Former [[komusubi]] [[Naminohana]] retires.

===May===
*Akebono wins his 9th yusho, and first for over two years, by defeating Takanohana twice on the final day, once in regulation and once in a playoff after both yokozuna finish on 13–2.  It is the first time that Takanohana and Akebono alone have fought a playoff, and comes after Akebono had lost seven times in a row to his rival. Wakanohana sits the tournament out. Kaio suffers a serious leg injury after standing at 7–4 on the 11th day and has to withdraw. Tamakasuga wins his second successive sansho, for Outstanding Performance. Tosanoumi and [[Tochiazuma Daisuke|Tochiazuma]] share the Fighting Spirit Award. [[Oginishiki]] wins the Technique Prize. [[Tokitsuumi]] wins the juryo yusho in his debut in the division. [[Toki Susumu|Toki]] wins the [[makushita]] championship. Former [[sekiwake]] [[Kotogaume]] retires, as does juryo wrestler [[Sunahama]] (William Taylor Hopkins) from [[Hawaii]].  
*Former ozeki [[Daiju Hisateru|Daiju]] takes over the running of [[Asahiyama stable]] following the death of its stablemaster.

===June===
*To mark 100 years of trade relations between [[Japan]] and [[Australia]] a tour by top division wrestlers visits [[Melbourne]] on the 6th and 7th, where an exhibition tournament is held at [[Melbourne Park]] (home of the [[Australian Open]]), and [[Sydney]] on the 13th and 14th, at the [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]].

===July===
*Takanohana defeats Akebono on the final day in Nagoya to claim his 17th championship with a 13–2 record. Akebono is runner-up on 12–3. [[Takatoriki]] is third on 11–4 and wins the Outstanding Performance Prize. Tochiazuma wins his first Technique Award, and [[Tochinonada]] receives the Fighting Spirit Prize. Wakanohana just preserves his ozeki status with an 8–7 record. Chiyotaikai wins his second juryo championship and promotion to makuuchi, the first top division wrestler produced by the former [[Chiyonofuji]] ([[Kokonoe-oyakata]]). Former juryo veteran [[Dairyu]] retires at the age of 37 after 21 years in sumo.

===September===
*At the Aki basho Takanohana wins back-to-back titles for the first time in a year, defeating Musashimaru in a playoff after both men finish on 13–2. [[Takanonami]] is third on 12–3.Dejima finishes on 11–4 and wins Technique and Outstanding Performance Prizes. Tochiazuma also receives a share of the Technique Prize in his debut tournament at sekiwake. The Fighting Spirit Award goes to Tochinonada for the second time in a row. In the juryo division [[Oginohana Akikazu|Oginohana]] wins his fourth championship. [[Toyozakura]] wins the makushita yusho. [[Takeshi Rikio|Rikio]] retires after a disagreement with his stablemaster (the former [[Takanosato]]).

===November===
*In Kyushu, former ozeki [[Konishiki]] retires after winning only five bouts at maegashira 14, bringing to an end a career that encompassed three yusho and 81 consecutive top division tournaments. His final match proves to be his eighth defeat in his bout against [[Kotonowaka]] on Day 13, as he is not allowed onto the [[dohyo]] to face [[Misugisato]] on the following day due to his stablemaster having already handed in his retirement papers. Former sekiwake [[Wakashoyo]], and maegashira [[Kotobeppu]] also retire.  The championship is won by Takanonami, his second. He defeats his stablemate Takanohana in a playoff after both wrestlers finish on 14–1. All the sekiwake and komusubi record [[make-koshi|losing scores]], the first time this has happened in seven years. Unsurprisingly only one special prize is awarded, to [[Musoyama]] for Fighting Spirit. Akebono sits the tournament out. [[Wakanosato]] wins the juryo title after a playoff with [[Susanoumi]]. [[Kitazakura]] wins the [[makushita]] yusho.

==Deaths==
*20 May: Asahiyama Oyakata (former komusubi [[Wakafutase]]), aged 55.
*5 July: Former sekiwake [[Kainoyama]] (also briefly Onogawa Oyakata), aged 57.
*18 August: Former sekiwake [[Tochiakagi]], aged 42.

[[File:Rollerblader Soul Grind.jpg|thumb|300px|A skater executing a soul grind]]


Aggressive skating (referred to by participants as '''rollerblading, blading, skating or rolling''') is a sub discipline of inline skating primarily focused on the execution of tricks in the action sports canon. Aggressive inline skates are specially modified to accommodate grinds and jumps. Aggressive skating can take place on found street obstacles or at skate parks.

Since 1994, the sport has been chronicled in various skating films and "edits."

== Hardware ==

Aggressive skates are identifiable from recreational or speed skates by a prominent gap in between the second and third wheels (The H-Block which allows for grinds perpendicular to the direction of the wheels. A hard plastic surface on the sole of the boot known as a "Sole plate" or "Soul Plate" allows grinds parallel to the direction of the wheels. From these grind surfaces comes a lexicon of well known grind stances, though sliding can occur on any surface of the boot or wheels. Aggressive skates typically have much smaller wheels than a traditional inline skates. The small size allows for more freedom when grinding as there is less risk of catching on obstacles. Additionally these small wheels feature a flat profile to accommodate the impact from jumping tall heights. In recent years aggressive skates have begun to adopt larger frames and wheels, in what is seen as a bridging of the various inline disciplines. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theblademuseum.com/category/dailybread/&lt;/ref&gt;

== UFS ==


== History ==
In 1980, a group of [[ice hockey]] players in [[Minnesota]] were looking for a way to practice during the summer.&lt;ref name="McKenna 11"&gt;McKenna p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Scott and Brennan Olson formed the company [[Rollerblade]], Inc., to sell skates with four polyurethane wheels arranged in a straight line on the bottom of a padded boot.&lt;ref name="McKenna 11"/&gt; In 1988, Rollerblade introduced the first aggressive inline skate, the Rollerblade Lightning TRS. Aggressive inline skating finally developed as an organized sport in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="McKenna 15"&gt;McKenna p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the first ever competition series was launched on the beaches of Southern California by two childhood friends turned promoters Rick Stark and Mark Billik.  The event was called The National Inline Skate Series better known as NISS to aggressive skaters around the world. Their company Anywhere Sports Productions sold [[Taco Bell]] on sponsoring the series for $150,000 and a six stop series was born. Chris Edwards and Arlo Eisenberg were the eventual champions of the 1994 series.  NISS, went strong for 5 years holding contests in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Rome]] and [[Brazil]]. NISS, was the first series to put aggressive inline on TV with an ESPN deal for the 1994 series and later moving the competition series to PRIME TICKET-Fox Sports.  The Aggressive Skaters Association (ASA) was formed by a number of aggressive inline skaters in 1995 as a forum to develop rules governing competitions and equipment.&lt;ref name="McKenna 15"/&gt; The sport was included in the first ESPN [[X-Games]] in 1995 and included [[half pipe|vertical ramp]] and street event competitions.&lt;ref name="McKenna 23"&gt;McKenna p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its height in popularity in the late 90s, with mainstream movies like [[Disney]]'s [[Brink!]] and other films.  The "Senate" brand, run by [[Arlo Eisenberg]] and several other prominent skaters, was very popular during the 1990s.

Founded by company owners/skating legends [[Brian Shima]], Jon Julio and Kato Mateu and supported by all major skate companies, the World Rolling Series (WRS) links together the best skaters, event organizers, retailers and skate parks and aims to "create a tighter knit community, increase overall awareness and set a higher standard for aggressive rollerblading." The WRS circuit started in 2009 with 10 established professional contests in France, Netherlands, England, Spain, Argentina, Australia and the United States. In 2012, WRS now includes 100+ Amateurs and Professional events categorized from 1 to 5 stars in over 20 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrollingseries.com/about/|title=WRS - About|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressive inline skating was removed from the ESPN X-Games in 2005 although it is still included in the Asian X Games, LG Action Sports Competitions, Montpellier Fise, and many other large competitions, some associated with WRS, some not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://espn.go.com/action/news/story?page=EXPN.no_xg_inline |title=Inline No Longer X Games Competition |date=March 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current aggressive inline skate manufacturers include Remz, [[Universal Skate Design|USD]], Them Skates, Razors, Rollerblade, K2, Roces, Seba and Trigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locoskates.com/aggressive-skates/c192|title=Aggressive Skates|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Street===
In street skating, also known as freestyle skating, the skater performs tricks by utilizing features existing in a common, everyday environment.&lt;ref name="Murdico 37"&gt;Murdico p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; This involves skaters grinding hand rails and concrete ledges, jumping stairs, ramping off of embankments and generally turning anything on the regular street into an obstacle, ramp, or grind rail.&lt;ref name="Murdico 37" /&gt; Creativity is often seen as an important aspect of street skating, since skaters are able to invent or link tricks specific to a unique environment, rather than performing more standard maneuvers on predefined obstacles as in park and [[vert skating]].

===Park===
Park skating refers to skating that occurs in various private and community [[skatepark]]s. This style differs from street skating due to the specific nature of skate parks, which are designed for skaters to do tricks, e.g. on the top of the ramp (coping). Park skating often emphasizes the technical side of aggressive inline, focusing on the variety of tricks a skater can do and encouraging skaters to connect tricks. A series of tricks connected together in a fluid motion over different obstacles is known as a ''line''.  Skate parks often feature quarter pipes and [[half-pipes]], curved ramps and other features that are not usually found in a regular urban setting.  A better quality skate park will have good lines—making it easier for skaters to perform tricks.  Good skateparks have a flow to them.

=== Vert ===
[[Vert ramp|Vert]] is an other discipline of inline skating. It mostly consists in air tricks, such as rotations and grind tricks on coping. In this type of skating some of the most famous names are the [[Takeshi Yasutoko|Yasutoko]] [[Eito Yasutoko|brothers]], [[Taig Khris]] as well as many others.

Aggressive inline skates are specially designed to be tougher and stronger than normal inline skates, due to the high levels of stress placed on the skate by the stunts and tricks a skater performs. A typical skate consists of a number of different parts.

|}

Typically each part is replaceable, and certain manufacturers provided parts that have been divided into individual sections, so a skater can replace specific worn areas.

===Frames===
The chassis of the skate, called the frame, bolts to the bottom of the skate. Skaters grind on the frames, which are designed for this purpose. Sometimes they plant the outer frames horizontally on a rail or ledge surface to execute so-called ''topside grinds''.

There are several different variations on frame design. Originally a skate had four wheels on each skate, with a gap between the middle wheel where a plastic insert called an H-block was used for grinding. During earlier times, a plastic plate, known as the ''grind plate'' was attached to the frame on the outside of the two middle wheels instead of an H-block. This allowed normal recreational skates to be converted into aggressive skates, and it was how most aggressive skates were built at the time. On aggressive skates with H-blocks, the grind plate could be used to increase the life of the H-block. But as frame manufacturers began making removable H-blocks, the grind plate fell out of favor. As the sport evolved, skate companies started manufacturing wheels that were intentionally hard and undersized, in order to facilitate grinding. The undersized wheels are called anti-rockers, and replace the two middle wheels.

Generally, there are three different types of modern frames: flat, anti-rocker, and freestyle. Flat, as described above, means you have four wheels per skate. There is another variation of this called the Hi-Lo setup. This means it has large outer wheels, but small inner wheels to make grinding easy. The inner wheels' axles are closer to the ground so that all the wheels touch the ground.

Anti-rocker, as also described above, is the most popular setup. Freestyle frames have no inner wheels, giving the user a large amount of space in the middle for grinding. Another setup that's gaining popularity, called tri-rocker, means that there are three wheels per skate. The remaining axle hole is left empty or replaced with an anti-rocker wheel. This combines the benefits of a flat setup (going fast and turning easily) with the benefits of an anti-rocker/freestyle setup (grinding easily). The frame company Create Originals makes frames that are meant for tri rocker to be a possibility.

In the late 1990s, the Universal Frame System (UFS) was introduced by frame manufacturers to allow the user to easily customize their skates.&lt;ref name="Weil 12"&gt;Weil p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This led to increased customization of skates within the sport by allowing the user interchangeability between different companies' frames.&lt;ref name="Weil 12" /&gt; Today, all major frame and skate manufacturers support UFS.

===Wheels===
Modern skate wheels have undergone many years of development and iteration. The development of the main material, polyurethane (usually simply called urethane), has been dependent on advancements in the polymer industry. The balance between hardness and grip is the key to an optimum skate wheel. Aggressive skate wheels are usually between 54 and 72mm, while anti-rocker wheels are between 40 and 47mm.

===Anti-rocker wheels===
Two high density polyurethane or plastic wheels between 40 and 47mm, replacing the inner two wheels. The name is derived from the nature of flat(rocker) setups to "rock" (become unstable) over concave or convex surfaces. Eliminating the center wheels eliminates the instability by reducing the number of contact points the skate has with the ground. Having only two wheels on a frame ensures that any weight on that skate will be distributed 50/50, front to back. Some skaters prefer replacing only one of the inner wheels with anti-rockers (called tri-rocker).
Anti-rocker wheels enable skaters to grind obstacles with a relatively high diameter. These wheels unlike "normal" (larger, softer) wheels, give skaters the ability to approach obstacles in ways they might not be able to otherwise. This depends on boot dimensions/style, frame dimensions/style and skater dimensions/style. While larger wheels leave less of a gap between them, the smaller anti-rocker wheels bring the surface of the edge being grided closer to the frame. At the same time the added space between the center wheels, allows for the entire skate to be angled farther forward for a more centered position over the edge. The lower coefficient of friction slides faster than that of a softer wheel, so it may unobstructively rest on the horrozontal surface(s) of the obstacle, allowing for the afore mentioned angle/position of the boot/skater while grinding.  This is an angle that may be impossible to achieve with certain frame/flat(rocker) combinations on certain obstacles. An anti-rocker setup would be used at the skaters discretion, based on the terrain they planned to skate, and way they wish to skate it. One disadvantage of an anti-rocker setup is the speed that is lost, as four load bearing wheels are removed, and the weight distributed to each of the remaining is increased.

==Media==

=== Video ===
Skate videos began in 1994 with the  release of ''The Hoax: An In-Line Crime''.  [[K2 Sports]], [[Salomon Group|Salomon]] and [[Rollerblade]] were early proponents of the sport and released their own videos.  Senate, arguably the first inline-only company, released a number of influential films during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-08/news/we-36162_1_in-line-skating|title=VENICE :  Event Helps Skaters Get All In-Line|work=latimes|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Videogroove, Mindgame, Razors, KFC, and Valo released a number of notable films during the early 2000s. During this period the genre transitioned from VHS to DVD like much of the rest of the entertainment industry. They have similarly transitioned to the digital format since the 2010s.

Skate videos, like their skateboarding and BMX counterparts, feature skaters both professional and amateur, in "edits," segments of skating usually accompanied by one or more songs.  Music is often used without permission.  Alternatively, original music is sometimes created specifically for the film.

A 2006 documentary, ''[[Barely Dead]]'', gives an overview of skating, focusing on its popularity and decline.

'''Cardiovascular Endurance''' is  the ability of the heart and lungs to supply oxygen-rich blood to the working [[Muscle|muscle tissues]] and the ability of the muscles to use oxygen to produce energy for movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.qld.gov.au/npag/glossary.asp |title=National Physical Activity Guidelines, Glossary |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The State of Queensland |accessdate=December 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316212430/http://www.health.qld.gov.au/npag/glossary.asp |archivedate=March 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of fitness is a health-related component of physical fitness that is brought about by sustained physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frankmoranfitness.com/fitnessglossary.htm |title=Glossary of Fitness and Health Terms |author=Frank Moran |date= |work= |publisher=Frank Moran |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person's ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is affected by many [[physiological]] parameters, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and maximal oxygen consumption.

Understanding the relationship between cardiorespiratory endurance [[Fitness training|training]] and other categories of conditioning requires a review of changes that occur with increased aerobic, or anaerobic capacity. As aerobic/anaerobic capacity increases, general [[metabolism]] rises, muscle metabolism is enhanced, [[haemoglobin]] rises, buffers in the bloodstream increase, venous return is improved, stroke volume is improved, and the blood bed becomes more able to adapt readily to varying demands. Each of these results of cardiovascular fitness/cardiorespiratory conditioning will have a direct positive effect on muscular endurance, and an indirect effect on strength and flexibility.

To facilitate optimal delivery of oxygen to the working muscles, the person needs to train or participate in activities that will build up the energy stores needed for sport. This is referred to as metabolic training. Metabolic training is generally divided into two types: [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]]. A 2005 Cochrane review demonstrated that physical activity interventions are effective for increasing cardiovascular fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hillsdon|first=M.|last2=Foster|first2=C.|last3=Thorogood|first3=M.|date=2005-01-25|title=Interventions for promoting physical activity|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=1|pages=CD003180|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003180.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4164373|pmid=15674903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''City Football Academy, Melbourne''' is the training and administrative headquarters of professional [[Association football|football]] club [[Melbourne City FC]], located in the [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] suburb of [[Bundoora, Victoria|Bundoora]].

==Features==
The facility is owned by the Anglo-Arab football company [[City Football Group]] and is situated within the [[La Trobe University]] precinct.&lt;ref name="trobe"/&gt; Constructed in late 2014 for approximately $15 million Australian dollars, the City Football Academy serves as the [[Asia-Pacific]] base for the City Football Group company and since its opening in February 2015 has provided tenant club Melbourne City with the premier facilities of any [[A-League]] club.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/football/a-league/melbourne-city-unveil-new-15m-training-facility-as-city-football-group-show-a-league-commitment/story-e6frf4gl-1227240378917?sv=f1bd5f9d8587ec59a86767c835b109a8|title=Melbourne City unveil new $15m training facility as City Football Group show A-League commitment|publisher=Herald Sun|date=27 February 2015|author=David Davutovic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the facilities features are a world-class [[physiotherapy]], sports [[Athletic training|rehabilitation]] and administrative building as well as a $2 million DESSO pitch, which is hybrid grass system where natural grassroots intertwine with artificial turf fibres and is able to withstand three times the wear of a normal pitch.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;

The facility is also the administrative and training hub of Melbourne City's [[Melbourne City FC NPL|youth team]] and its [[Melbourne City FC W-League|women's team]].&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-13/melbourne-city-joins-w-league/6466888|title=Melbourne City joins W-League|publisher=ABC News|date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, the club unveiled the Elite Women's Facility, an extension of the complex providing dedicated warm-up, training, locker and lecture rooms for the women's team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/wleague-melbourne-city-women-get-a-place-to-call-home-20161124-gswlmk.html|title=W-League: Melbourne City women get a place to call home|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=TQ24te3vpZk|work=Melbourne City FC|publisher=YouTube|date=1 December 2016|title=Elite Women's Facility Launched: City Football Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Copperheads.jpg|thumb|Four different Copperheads]]
In [[rock climbing]], a '''copperhead''' is a small [[nut (climbing)|nut]] with a head made of soft metal on a loop of wire,&lt;ref name="American Alpine Institute Intro to Aid Technique"&gt;{{cite web|last=American Alpine Institute|title=American Alpine Institute Intro to Aid Technique|url=http://alpineinstitute.blogspot.com/2011/02/intro-to-aid-technique.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally [[copper]] or [[brass]], later [[aluminium]]. Copperheads are most often placed into small shallow seams and crevices by pounding or hammering them in to place, with a [[Rock_climbing_hammer|climbing hammer]], sometimes with the aid of metal rod, chisel, or punch.  The malleability of the soft metal head makes copperheads conform to the rock and grip better than other devices, and are often the only protection that will stay fixed in many placements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tech Tip - Big Wall - Copperheading|url=https://www.climbing.com/skills/tech-tip-big-wall-copperheading/|website=climbing.com|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Use Copperheads For Aid Climbing|url=http://www.vdiffclimbing.com/copperhead/|website=vdiffclimbing.com|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their small size and low strength makes them among the poorest kinds of [[protection (climbing)|protection]]; their main use is in [[aid climbing]] where a placement that will just support the weight of the climber can be used to make progress, even though it would be useless in a fall.

'''Daytona International Speedway''' is a [[race track]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], United States.  Since opening in 1959, it has been the home of the [[Daytona 500]], the most prestigious race in [[NASCAR]]. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosts races of [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]], [[AMA Superbike]], [[United SportsCar Championship|USCC]], [[SCCA]], and [[Motocross]]. The track features multiple layouts including the primary {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=mid}} high-speed [[tri-oval]], a {{convert|3.56|mi|km|adj=mid}} [[sports car]] course, a {{convert|2.95|mi|km|adj=mid}} motorcycle course, and a {{convert|1320|ft|m|adj=mid}} karting and motorcycle flat-track. The track's {{convert|180|acre|adj=on}} infield includes the {{convert|29|acre|adj=on}} [[Lake Lloyd]], which has hosted [[powerboat]] racing. The speedway is owned and operated by [[International Speedway Corporation]].

The track was built in 1959 by NASCAR founder [[Bill France Sr.|William "Bill" France, Sr.]] to host racing that was held at the former [[Daytona Beach Road Course]]. His banked design permitted higher speeds and gave fans a better view of the cars. Lights were installed around the track in 1998, and today it is the third-largest single lit outdoor sports facility. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004 and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.

On January 22, 2013, the track unveiled artist depictions of a renovated speedway. On July 5, 2013, ground was broken on the project that removed backstretch seating and completely redevelop the frontstretch seating. The renovation to the speedway was constructed by Design-Builder Barton Malow Company in partnership with Rossetti Architects. The project, named "Daytona Rising", was completed in January 2016, and cost [[United States dollar|US $]]400 million, placing emphasis on improving fan experience with five expanded and redesigned fan entrances (called "injectors"), as well as wider and more comfortable seating with more restrooms and concession stands. After the renovations were completed, the track's grandstands include 101,000 permanent seats with the ability to increase permanent seating to 125,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reed |first=Steve |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/daytona-international-unveils-plans-upgrade-215431071--nascar.html |title=Daytona International unveils plans for upgrade |publisher=[[Yahoo!

==Track history==

===Construction===
[[NASCAR]] founder [[William France Sr.]] began planning for the track in 1953 as a way to promote the series, which at the time was racing on the [[Daytona Beach Road Course]].&lt;ref name="Hawkins&amp;nbsp;— Tales from 500"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Jim|title=Tales from the Daytona 500|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2003|edition=illustrated|pages=13–14 of 200|chapter=Big Bill's Dream for America's Speed Capital|isbn=978-1-58261-530-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGbf0A2G10gC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=1959+Daytona+500+qualify#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; France met with Daytona Beach engineer Charles Moneypenny to discuss his plans for the speedway. He wanted the track to have the highest banking possible to allow the cars to reach high speeds and to give fans a better view of the cars on track. Moneypenny traveled to [[Detroit]], Michigan to visit the [[Ford Proving Grounds]] which had a high-speed test track with banked corners. Ford shared their engineering reports of the track with Moneypenny, providing the needed details of how to transition the pavement from a flat straightaway to a banked corner. France took the plans to the Daytona Beach city commission, who supported his idea and formed the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority.&lt;ref name="created"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aumann|first=Mark|title=How Daytona International Speedway was created|url=http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/headlines/cup/02/04/daytona.500.dis.history/story_single.html|publisher=Nascar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Daytona International Speedway 2011.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The tri-oval after the 2010–2011 repaving]]
The city commission agreed to lease the {{convert|447|acre|ha|adj=on|lk=out}} parcel of land adjacent to [[Daytona Beach International Airport|Daytona Beach Municipal Airport]] to France's corporation for $10,000 a year over a 50-year period. France then began working on building funding for the project and found support from a [[Texas]] oil millionaire, Clint Murchison. Murchison loaned France $600,000 along with the construction equipment necessary to build the track. France was also able to secure funding from [[Pepsi-Cola]], [[General Motors]] designer [[Harley Earl]], a second mortgage on his home and selling 300,000 stock shares to local residents. Ground broke on construction of the {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} speedway on November 25, 1957.&lt;ref name="created" /&gt;

To build the high banking, crews had to excavate over a million square yards of soil from the track's infield.&lt;ref name="Star01-04-1959"&gt;{{cite news|title=World Marks Likely At New Daytona Track|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5965664/1959_usac_daytona_100/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=21|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=January 4, 1959|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the high water table in the area, the excavated hole filled with water to form what is now known as Lake Lloyd, named after Joseph "Sax" Lloyd, one of the original six members of the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority. (The lake would be stocked with 65,000 fish, and France would arrange [[speedboat]] races on it.)&lt;ref&gt;Kettlewell, Mike. "Daytona", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.503.&lt;/ref&gt; 22 tons of [[lime mortar]] had to be brought in to form the track's [[base course|binding base]], over which [[asphalt]] would be laid. Because of the extreme degree of banking, Moneypenny had to come up with a way to pave the incline. He connected the paving equipment to bulldozers anchored at the top of the banking. This would allow the paving equipment to pave the banking without slipping or rolling down the incline. Moneypenny subsequently patented his construction method and later designed [[Talladega Superspeedway]] and [[Michigan International Speedway]]. By December 1958, France had begun to run out of money and started relying on race ticket sales to complete construction.&lt;ref name="created" /&gt;

[[File:Daytona International Speedway on the day of the Daytona 500.JPG|thumb|left|The tri-oval during the [[2015 Daytona 500]] with nearly completed grandstand in the background.|200px]]
The first practice run on the new track began on February 6, 1959. On February 22, 1959, 42,000 people attended the inaugural Daytona 500,&lt;ref name="created" /&gt; and its finish was as startling as the track itself: [[Lee Petty]] beat [[Johnny Beauchamp]] in a [[photo finish]] that took three days to adjudicate.&lt;ref name="Kettlewell, p.503"&gt;Kettlewell, p.503.&lt;/ref&gt; When the track opened it was the fastest race track to ever host a stock car race, until [[Talladega Superspeedway]] opened 10 years later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} April 4, it would host a {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} [[Champ Car]] event, also, which saw [[Jim Rathmann]] beat [[Dick Rathmann]] and [[Rodger Ward]], and, with an average speed {{convert|170.26|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, was at the time the fastest motor race ever.&lt;ref name="Kettlewell, p.503"/&gt; It was also the occasion of Daytona's first fatality: [[George Amick]], attempting to overtake for third late in the race, hit a wall and was killed.&lt;ref name="Kettlewell, p.503"/&gt; April 5, a scheduled {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[sports car racing|sports car]] event (shortened to {{convert|560|mi|km|abbr=on}} by darkness) was won by [[Roberto Mieres]] and [[Fritz d'Orey]], who shared a [[Porsche 718|Porsche RSK]], which proved more durable than more potent competition.&lt;ref name="Kettlewell, p.503"/&gt;

Lights were installed around the track in 1998 to run NASCAR's July race, the [[Coke Zero 400]] at night. The track was the world's largest single lighted outdoor sports facility until being surpassed by [[Losail International Circuit]] in 2008.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[Musco Lighting]] installed the lighting system, which took into account glare and visibility for aircraft arriving and departing nearby Daytona Beach International Airport, and costs about $240 per hour when in operation.&lt;ref name="musco"&gt;{{cite web|title=Daytona International Speedway|url=http://www.musco.com/projshow/project.php?id=138+motorsports|publisher=Musco Lighting|accessdate=November 22, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307215735/http://www.musco.com/projshow/project.php?id=138+motorsports|archivedate=March 7, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layouts===

====Tri-Oval====
[[Image:Daytona International Speedway.svg|thumb|left|Map of the speedway]]
Daytona's [[tri-oval]] is {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} long with 31° banking in the turns and 18° banking at the start/finish line.  The front straight is {{convert|3800|ft|m}} long and the back straight (or "superstretch") is {{convert|3000|ft|m}} long.  The tri-oval shape was revolutionary at the time as it greatly improved sight lines for fans. It is one of the two tracks on the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series circuit that uses [[restrictor plate]]s to slow the cars down due to the high speeds, the other being [[Talladega Superspeedway]].&lt;ref name="trackfacts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Track Facts |url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/News/Track-Facts.aspx |publisher=Daytonainternationalspeedway.com |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016222618/http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/News/Track-Facts.aspx |archivedate=October 16, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2010, repaving of the track began. This came almost a year earlier than planned due to the track coming apart during the [[2010 Daytona 500]]. The project used an estimated 50,000 tons{{vague|date=April 2014}}&lt;!--long, short or metric?--&gt; of asphalt to repave {{convert|1400000|sqft|m2}} including the racing surface, apron, skid pads and pit road. Because of good weather, the project was completed ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name=goodyear&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodyear Tire Test on Daytona's New Racing Surface Set For Dec. 15–16|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2010/11/Homestead-Miami-Update.aspx|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2013, [[Colin Braun]] drove a [[Daytona Prototype]] car prepared by [[Michael Shank Racing]] to set a single-lap record on the tri-oval configuration of {{convert|222.971|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/GRAND-AM/News/Articles/2013/09/Braun-Sets-Daytona-Speed-Record.aspx|title=Braun Sets Daytona Speed Record|date=October 9, 2013|work=[[Motor Racing Network]]|accessdate=October 10, 2013|location=Concord, North Carolina|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014103832/http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/GRAND-AM/News/Articles/2013/09/Braun-Sets-Daytona-Speed-Record.aspx|archive-date=October 14, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During NASCAR Events, it takes less than a minute for the cars to complete a lap around the 2.5 mile tri-oval course.

====Road courses====
[[Image:Daytona International Speedway - Road Course.svg|thumb|left|Map of the 24-hour road course configuration]]
The 3.81-mile (6.13&amp;nbsp;km) road course was built in 1959 and first hosted a three-hour sports car race called the Daytona Continental in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.na-motorsports.com/Tracks/FL/Daytona.html|title=Daytona International Speedway|work=na-motorsports.com|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race length became {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1964,&lt;ref name="Kettlewell, p.503" /&gt; and in 1966 was extended to a 24-hour endurance race known as the [[Rolex 24 at Daytona]]. It was shortened again to six hours in 1972 and the 1974 rendition of the race was cancelled entirely.&lt;ref name="Kettlewell, p.503"/&gt;

In 1973, a sharp chicane was added at the end of the backstretch, approaching oval turn three.

In 1984&lt;ref&gt;http://wsrp.ic.cz/imsa1984.html#1 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919023547/http://wsrp.ic.cz/imsa1984.html |date=September 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1985,&lt;ref&gt;http://wsrp.ic.cz/imsa1985.html#1 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408195056/http://wsrp.ic.cz/imsa1985.html |date=April 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the layout was modified, re-profiling turns 1 and 2, and moving what is now turn 3 closer to its adjacent turns. In addition, the chicane on the backstretch was modified. A new entry leg was constructed approximately {{Convert|400|ft|m}} earlier, resulting in a longer, three-legged, "bus stop" shape. Cars would now enter in the first leg, bypass the second leg, and exit out of the existing third leg. Passing would now be possible inside the longer chicane. The construction resulted in a final length of {{convert|3.56|mi|km}} for the complete road course.

In 2003, the chicane was modified once again. The middle leg was repaved and widened, and now cars would enter through the first leg, and exit out of the second leg. The existing third leg was abandoned. This allowed cars a cleaner entry into oval turn three. After favorable results, in 2010 the third leg was dug up, and removed permanently.

While the more famous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] is held near the [[summer solstice]], Daytona's endurance race is held in winter (meaning more of the race is run at night). The track's lighting system is limited to 20% of its maximum output for the race to keep cars dependent on their headlights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race Profile&amp;nbsp;– 24 Hours of Daytona|url=http://www.sportscardigest.com/race-profile-%E2%80%93-24-hours-of-daytona/|publisher=Sports Car Digest|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daytona International Speedway - Moto Course.png|thumb|left|Map of the Moto-Course]]
In 2005, a second infield road course configuration was constructed, primarily [[Daytona 200|for motorcycles]]. Due to fears of tire wear on the banked oval sections, oval turns 1 and 2 were bypassed giving the new course a length of {{convert|2.95|mi}}. The Daytona SportBike that runs the Daytona 200 however, uses the main road course except for the motorcycle [[Pedro Rodríguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodríguez]] Hairpin (tighter than the one used for cars; the car version is used as an acceleration lane for motorcycles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Dean |title=Daytona Changes Course |url=http://www.superbikeplanet.com/2004/Aug/040811a.htm |publisher=Superbikeplanet.com |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |date=August 12, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305053703/http://www.superbikeplanet.com/2004/Aug/040811a.htm |archivedate=March 5, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 26 and 27, 2006, the [[IndyCar Series]] held a compatibility test on the 10-turn, {{convert|2.73|mi|km|sing=on}} modified road course, and the 12-turn {{convert|2.95|mi|km|sing=on}} motorcycle road course with 5 drivers. The drivers who tested at the track were [[Vitor Meira]], [[Sam Hornish Jr.]], [[Tony Kanaan]], [[Scott Dixon]] and [[Dan Wheldon]]. This marked the first time since 1984 that open wheel cars have taken to the track at Daytona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IRL Begins Testing at Daytona Road Course|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2006/09/IRL-Begins-Testing-At-Daytona-Road-Course.aspx|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 31&amp;nbsp;– February 1, 2007, IndyCar returned for a full test involving 17 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IndyCar Series Kicks Off Two-Day Test at Daytona |url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2007/01/Indycar-Series-Kicks-Off-Two-Day-Test-At-Daytona.aspx|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=January 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Supercross====
During [[Daytona Beach Bike Week]], a supercross track is built between pit road and the tri-oval section of the track.  Historically the track has used more sand than dirt, providing unique challenges to riders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The 2008–2013 track configurations were designed by former champion, [[Ricky Carmichael]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricky Carmichael Designs Daytona Supercross By Honda Course For Second Straight Year|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2009/01/Ricky-Carmichael-To-Design-Daytona-Supercross-By-Honda-Course-For-Second-Straight-Year.aspx|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daytona has hosted an [[AMA Supercross Championship]] round uninterruptedly since 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amasupercross.com/MediaGuide/SXMediaGuide_15_lores.pdf 2015 AMA Supercross media guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Daytona Flat Track and Infield Kart Track====
Popular dirt-track races in karting and flat-track motorcycle racing had been held at [[Municipal Stadium (Daytona Beach)|Daytona Beach Municipal Stadium]] but in 2009, the city announced the stadium was replacing its entire surface with [[FieldTurf]], and thereby eliminating the flat-track racing at the stadium. To continue racing, speedway officials built the Daytona Flat Track, a new quarter-mile dirt track outside of turns 1 &amp; 2 of the main superspeedway. It seats 5,000 in temporary grandstands and opened in December 2009 for WKA KartWeek.  From 2010 to 2016, it also hosted the [[AMA Grand National Championship]], before it was moved in 2017 to the tri-oval section and became a TT course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMA FLAT TRACK: DIS To Construct Dirt Track |url=http://moto-racing.speedtv.com/article/ama-flat-track-dis-to-construct-dirt-track/ |publisher=Speed |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |date=July 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716120344/http://moto-racing.speedtv.com/article/ama-flat-track-dis-to-construct-dirt-track/ |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a short paved kart/autocross track in the infield just inside of turn 3. The [[SCCA]] holds autocross on this track in addition to hosting sprint karting races during KartWeek.

===Short track===
In February 2012, it was announced that a {{convert|0.4|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Short track motor racing|short track]] would be constructed along the backstretch of the Speedway's main course, for NASCAR's lower-tier series to compete at during Speedweeks called the [[UNOH Battle at the Beach]], which is similar to the [[Toyota All-Star Showdown]], formerly held at [[Irwindale Speedway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/story/_/id/7578503/source-daytona-adding-short-track-races-2013-daytona-500-week|title=Source: Daytona building short track|last=Haddock|first=Tim|date=February 15, 2012|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first races were held on that track in February 2013. The track was shorten to {{convert|1980|ft|km|adj=on}} oval in 2014 by shorter straightaways. The future of racing at the short track is unknown after 2015 with the grandstands on the back straightaway being demolished as a part of the Daytona Rising project.

====Football====
In the fall of 1959, the track hosted several high school football games for the [[Father Lopez Catholic High School|Father Lopez Green Wave]] in their first year of their football program.

The track hosted four [[college football]] games featuring the Daytona-based [[Bethune–Cookman Wildcats]] in 1974 and 1975. In early 2014 track president Joie Chitwood expressed a desire to bring football back to the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college-football.si.com/2014/01/21/daytona-international-speedway-college-football/|title=Source: Daytona International Speedway hopes to host college football game after renovation|last=Newcomb|first=Tim|date=January 21, 2012|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=April 22, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429212126/http://college-football.si.com/2014/01/21/daytona-international-speedway-college-football/|archivedate=April 29, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games==
In 1994, [[Sega]] released an arcade game called ''[[Daytona USA (video game)|Daytona USA]]'', using their Model 2 hardware. It was developed by their famed "AM2" development team. The soundtrack for the game included vocals by [[Takenobu Mitsuyoshi]]. It is widely considered to be one of the most successful and influential racing games of all time.

[[iRacing.com]] have laser-scanned the facility twice. The first in 2008, and 2011 once the repave was completed. Both are available in official racing series. There has been no word to when and if it will be re-scanned now that the Daytona Rising project has now been completed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iracing.com/tracks/&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the oval layout and Rolex 24 Hour layout are available in both [[PlayStation 3]] video games ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo 6]]''. Daytona International Speedway is also featured in ''[[Forza Motorsport 6]]'' and ''[[Forza Motorsport 7]]'' for the Xbox One and Windows 10.

''[[Real Racing 3]]''{{'}}s second NASCAR update featured the Daytona International Speedway as a new circuit coming in three layouts. In addition to the oval and Rolex 24 Hour layouts in ''Gran Turismo'', there also exists a Daytona 200 layout in the game.

Daytona International Speedway is now a playable course in Sega's ''[[Daytona USA (video game)|Daytona USA]]'' arcade racing game series as of ''Daytona Championship USA'', which was released in 2017.

==Fatalities==
{{main article|List of Daytona International Speedway fatalities}}
40 people have been fatally injured in on-track incidents: 23 car drivers, twelve motorcyclists, three go-kart drivers, one powerboat racer, and one track worker. The most notable death may have been that of [[Dale Earnhardt]], who [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|was killed]] on the last lap of the [[2001 Daytona 500]] on February 18, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/motor/earnhardt/list.htm#daytona|title=Auto racing fatalities list|work=[[USA Today]]|date=February 18, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153103/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/motor/earnhardt/list.htm#daytona|archivedate=October 10, 2012|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fan amenities==
[[File:Earnhardt Grandstand.jpg|thumb|The former Earnhardt Grandstand at Daytona International Speedway, which was changed into one of the injectors after Daytona Rising]]

===UNOH Fanzone===
The '''UNOH Fanzone''' is an access package similar to pit passes for fans to get closer to drivers and race teams. The fanzone was built in 2004 as part of a renovation of the track's infield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hembree|first=Mike|title=NASCAR fans get in the 'zone' at Daytona International Speedway|url=http://www.scenedaily.com/news/articles/sprintcupseries/NASCAR_fans_get_in_the_zone_at_Daytona_International_Speedway.html|publisher=Scene|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans are able to walk on top of the garages, known as the "fandeck", and view track and garage activity. Fans can also view race teams working in the garage, including NASCAR technical inspection, through windows. The garage windows also include slots for fans to hand merchandise to drivers for autographs. The fanzone also includes a live entertainment stage, additional food and drink areas and various other activities and displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprint FANZONE |url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Tickets-Events/Events/2011/Speedweeks-2011/Sprint-FANZONE.aspx |publisher=Daytona international Speedway |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226123005/http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Tickets-Events/Events/2011/Speedweeks-2011/Sprint-FANZONE.aspx |archivedate=December 26, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004 renovation of the infield, headed by design firm [[HNTB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daytona Speedway |url=http://www.hntb.com/our-work/market/sports#/ajax/project/976 |publisher=HNTB |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231121905/http://www.hntb.com/our-work/market/sports |archivedate=December 31, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first major renovation of the infield in the history of the track.&lt;ref name=aia-award&gt;{{cite web|last=Engdahl |first=David |title=Daytona International Speedway Renovation |url=http://info.aia.org/nwsltr_db.cfm?pagename=db_a_200603_engdahl |publisher=American Institute of Architects |accessdate=November 22, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the fanzone, a new vehicle and pedestrian tunnel was built under turn 1.  The tunnel posed a challenge to engineers because it was to be built under the water table. Another challenge came during construction when three named hurricanes passed by the track, flooding much of the excavation work. The infield renovation involved landscaping and hardscaping, such as a new walkway along the shore of Lake Lloyd, and the construction of 34 new buildings, including garages and fueling stations, offices and inspection facilities, and a club. The renovation project received a 2005 Award for Excellence from Design-Build Institute of America.&lt;ref name="aia-award"/&gt; Following the success of the UNOH Fanzone at Daytona, [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] and [[Kansas Speedway]] each built a similar infield fanzone.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} On December 9, 2016, the speedway announced that the [[University of Northwestern Ohio]] purchased entitlement rights to the fanzone, and that the area will be named 'UNOH Fanzone'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNOH to Serve as Entitlement Partner of Fanzone|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2016/12/UNOH-To-Serve-As-Entitlement-Partner-Of-Fanzone.aspx|website=daytonainternationalspeedway.com|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=December 20, 2016|date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Budweiser Party Porch===
The '''Budweiser Party Porch''' was a {{convert|46|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} porch located along the backstretch of the track. It was built on top of a portion of the backstretch grandstands and includes a {{convert|277|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}}, {{convert|33|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} sign, the largest sign in motorsports.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The porch featured tables, food and drinks, offering fans a "fun-filled" atmosphere that breaks fans away from the confines of grandstand seating without sacrificing on the view. Below the porch was an interactive fan zone featuring amusement rides, a go-kart track, show cars and merchandise trailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budweiser Party Porch Is The Place To Be on the Superstretch for the 52nd Annual Daytona 500|url=http://www.catchfence.com/2010/sprintcup/02/09/budweiser-party-porch-is-the-place-to-be-on-the-superstretch-for-the-52nd-annual-daytona-500/|publisher=The Catchfence|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2015 racing season, the Party Porch was torn down with the backstretch grandstands as part of the DAYTONA Rising project.

'''Fencing''' is a group of three related [[combat sports]]. The three disciplines in modern fencing are the  [[foil (fencing)|foil]], the [[épée]], and the [[sabre (fencing)|sabre]]; winning points are made through the contact with an opponent. A fourth discipline, [[singlestick]], appeared in the 1904 Olympics but was dropped after that, and is not a part of modern fencing. Fencing was one of the first sports to be played in the Olympics. Based on the traditional skills of [[swordsmanship]], the modern sport arose at the end of the 19th century, with the [[Italy|Italian]] school having modified the [[Historical European martial arts|historical European martial art]] of [[classical fencing]], and the [[France|French]] school later refining the Italian system. There are three forms of modern fencing, each of which uses a different kind of weapon and has different rules; thus the sport itself is divided into three competitive scenes: foil, épée, and sabre. Most competitive fencers choose to specialize in one weapon only.

Competitive fencing is one of the five activities which have been featured in every modern [[Olympic Games]], the other four being [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|athletics]], [[Cycling at the Summer Olympics|cycling]], [[Swimming at the Summer Olympics|swimming]], and [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|gymnastics]].

==Competitive fencing==

===Governing body===
{{further|Fédération Internationale d'Escrime}}

Fencing is governed by Fédération Internationale d'Escrime (FIE). Today, its head office is in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland. The FIE is composed of 145 national federations, each of which is recognised by its state [[National Olympic Committee|Olympic Committee]] as the sole representative of Olympic-style fencing in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fie.org/|title=INTERNATIONAL FENCING FEDERATION|website=fie.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules===
{{main|Fencing practice and techniques}}

The FIE maintains the current rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fie.ch/Fencing/Rules.aspx|title=INTERNATIONAL FENCING FEDERATION|website=fie.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; used by FIE sanctioned international events, including world cups, world championships and the Olympic Games. The FIE handles proposals to change the rules the first year after an Olympic year in the annual congress. The US Fencing Association has slightly different rules, but usually adheres to FIE standards.

{{further|History of fencing}}

Fencing traces its roots to the development of [[swordsmanship]] for [[duel]]s and [[self defense]]. Fencing is believed to have originated in Spain; some of the most significant books on fencing were written by Spanish fencers. ''Treatise on Arms''&lt;ref name="Valera1515"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diego de Valera|title=Tratado delos rieptos &amp;#91;et&amp;#93; desafios que entre los caualleros &amp;#91;et&amp;#93; hijos dalgo se acostu&amp;#91;m&amp;#93;bran hazer segun las costu&amp;#91;m&amp;#93;bres de España, Francia &amp;#91;et&amp;#93; Ynglaterra: enel qual se contiene quales y quantos son los casos de traycion &amp;#91;et&amp;#93; de menos valer &amp;#91;et&amp;#93; las enseñas &amp;#91;et&amp;#93; cotas darmas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CJ-57MPyTcC&amp;pg=PT46|date=1515*|publisher=Alfonso de Orta|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt; was written by Diego de Valera between 1458 and 1471 and is one of the oldest surviving manuals on western fencing (in spite of the title, the book of Diego Valera was on heraldry, not about fencing)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearma.org/Manuals/i33/i33.htm |title=I.33 Medieval German Sword &amp; Buckler Manual |publisher=ARMA |date= |accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly before dueling came under official ban by the Catholic Monarchs. In conquest, the Spanish forces carried fencing around the world, particularly to southern Italy, one of the major areas of strife between both nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~fencing/oldweb/history/fencinghistory.html A History of Fencing].

The mechanics of modern fencing originated in the 18th century in an Italian school of fencing of the Renaissance, and under their influence, were improved by the French school of fencing.&lt;ref name="www.fencing.net intro2"&gt;[http://www.fencing.net/intro2.html Fencing Online].

Library.thinkquest.org. Retrieved on 2012-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish school of fencing stagnated and was replaced by the Italian and French schools.

===Development into a sport===
The shift towards fencing as a sport rather than as military training happened from the mid-18th century, and was led by [[Domenico Angelo]], who established a fencing academy, Angelo's School of Arms, in [[Carlisle House, Soho#Carlisle House, Carlisle Street|Carlisle House]], [[Soho]], [[London]] in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;F.H.W. Sheppard, ed. ''Survey of London'' volume 33 ''The Parish of St. Anne, Soho (north of Shaftesbury Avenue)'', [[London County Council]], London: University of London, 1966, pp. 143&amp;ndash;48, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41071 online at British History Online].&lt;/ref&gt; There, he taught the [[aristocracy]] the fashionable art of [[swordsmanship]]. His school was run by three generations of his family and dominated the art of European fencing for almost a century.
&lt;ref name="Evangelista"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TyJ8ebnS1HMC|title=The Encyclopedia of the Sword|author=Nick Evangelista|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angelo Domenico Malevolti Fencing Print, 1763.JPG|thumb|upright=1.65|left|1763 fencing print from [[Domenico Angelo]]'s instruction book. Angelo was instrumental in turning fencing into an athletic sport.]]
He established the essential rules of [[Human position|posture]] and [[Footwork (martial arts)|footwork]] that still govern modern [[sport fencing]], although his attacking and [[Parry (fencing)|parry]]ing methods were still much different from current practice. Although he intended to prepare his students for real combat, he was the first fencing master to emphasize the [[health]] and sporting benefits of fencing more than its use as a killing art, particularly in his influential book ''L'École des armes'' (''The School of Fencing''), published in 1763.&lt;ref name="Evangelista"/&gt;

The first regularized fencing competition was held at the inaugural [[Royal Tournament|Grand Military Tournament and Assault at Arms]] in 1880, held at the [[Royal Agricultural Hall]], in [[Islington]] in June.  The Tournament featured a series of competitions between [[British army|army]] officers and soldiers. Each bout was fought for five hits and the foils were pointed with black to aid the judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fencingmuseum.com/Large/2013/2013-01-latest-Essay.htm|title=THE DEVELOPMENT OF FENCING WEAPONS |author=Malcolm Fare}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Gymnastics|Amateur Gymnastic &amp; Fencing Association]] drew up an official set of fencing regulations in 1896.

Fencing was part of the [[Olympic Games]] in the [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics|summer of 1896]]. Sabre events have been held at every [[Summer Olympics]]; foil events have been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908; épée events have been held at every Summer Olympics except in the [[1896 Summer Olympics|summer of 1896]] because of unknown reasons.

Starting with [[épée]] in 1933, side judges were replaced by the Laurent-Pagan electrical scoring apparatus,&lt;ref&gt;Alaux, Michel. ''Modern Fencing: Foil, Epee, and Sabre''. Scribner's, 1975, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; with an audible tone and a red or green light indicating when a touch landed. [[Foil (fencing)|Foil]] was automated in 1956, [[Sabre (fencing)|sabre]] in 1988. The scoring box reduced the bias in judging, and permitted more accurate scoring of faster actions, lighter touches, and more touches to the back and flank than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/fencing-equipment3.htm|title=How Fencing Equipment Works|last=Freudenrich|first=Craig|date=21 Sep 2000|website=How Stuff Works|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
===Weapons===
There are three weapons in modern fencing: foil, épée, and sabre.  Each weapon has its own rules and strategies. Equipment needed includes at least 2 swords, a Lame (not for épée), a white jacket, underarm protector, two body and mask cords, knee high socks, glove and knickers.

====Foil====
[[File:Fencing foil valid surfaces 2009.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Valid foil targets]]
{{Main|Foil (fencing)}}
The foil is a light thrusting weapon with a maximum weight of 500 grams.  The foil targets the torso, but not the arms or legs.  The foil has a small circular hand guard that serves to protect the hand from direct stabs.  As the hand is not a valid target in foil, this is primarily for safety. Touches are scored only with the tip; hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus (and do not halt the action). Touches that land outside the target area (called an ''off-target touch'' and signaled by a distinct color on the scoring apparatus) stop the action, but are not scored. Only a single touch can be awarded to either fencer at the end of a phrase. If both fencers land touches within a close enough interval of milliseconds to register two lights on the machine, the [[referee]] uses the rules of "right of way" to determine which fencer is awarded the touch, or if an off-target hit has priority over a valid hit, in which case no touch is awarded.  If the referee is unable to determine which fencer has right of way, no touch is awarded.

====Épée====
[[File:Fencing epee valid surfaces.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Valid épée targets]]
{{Main|Épée}}

The épée is a thrusting weapon like the foil, but heavier, with a maximum total weight of 775 grams.  In épée, the entire body is valid target.  The hand guard on the épée is a large circle that extends towards the pommel, effectively covering the hand, which is a valid target in épée.  Like foil, all hits must be with the tip and not the sides of the blade.  Hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus (and do not halt the action).  As the entire body is legal target, there is no concept of an off-target touch, except if the fencer accidentally strikes the floor, setting off the light and tone on the scoring apparatus.  Unlike foil and sabre, épée does not use "right of way", and awards simultaneous touches to both fencers. However, if the score is tied in a match at the last point and a double touch is scored, the point is null and void.

====Sabre====
[[File:Fencing saber valid surfaces.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Valid sabre targets]]
{{Main|Sabre (fencing)}}

The sabre is a light cutting and thrusting weapon that targets the entire body above the waist, except the weapon hand. Saber is the newest weapon to be used.  Like the foil, the maximum legal weight of a sabre is 500 grams.   The hand guard on the sabre extends from hilt to the point at which the blade connects to the pommel. This guard is generally turned outwards during sport to protect the sword arm from touches. Hits with the entire blade or point are valid. As in foil, touches that land outside the target area are not scored. However, unlike foil, these ''off-target'' touches do not stop the action, and the fencing continues. In the case of both fencers landing a scoring touch, the referee determines which fencer receives the point for the action, again through the use of "right of way".

===Protective clothing===
Most [[personal protective equipment]] for fencing is made of tough [[cotton]] or [[nylon]]. [[Kevlar]] was added to top level uniform pieces (jacket, breeches, underarm protector, lamé, and the bib of the mask) following the death of [[Vladimir Viktorovich Smirnov|Vladimir Smirnov]] at the 1982 World Championships in [[Rome]]. However, Kevlar is degraded by both [[ultraviolet light]] and [[chlorine]], which can complicate cleaning.

Other ballistic fabrics, such as [[Dyneema]], have been developed that [[Puncture resistance|resist puncture]], and which do not degrade the way that Kevlar does. FIE rules state that tournament wear must be made of fabric that resists a force of {{convert|800|N}}, and that the mask bib must resist twice that amount.

The complete fencing kit includes:

;Jacket
:The jacket is form-fitting, and has a strap (''croissard'') that passes between the legs. In sabre fencing, jackets are cut along the waist.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} A small [[gorget]] of folded fabric is sewn in around the collar to prevent an opponent's blade from slipping under the mask and along the jacket upwards towards the neck. Fencing instructors may wear a heavier jacket, such as one reinforced by plastic foam, to deflect the frequent hits an instructor endures.
;Plastron
:A [[plastron]] is an underarm protector worn underneath the jacket. It provides double protection on the side of the sword arm and upper arm. There is no seam under the arm, which would line up with the jacket seam and provide a weak spot.
;Glove
:The sword hand is protected by a [[glove]] with a gauntlet that prevents blades from going up the sleeve and causing injury. The glove also improves grip.
;Breeches
:[[Breeches]] or [[Knickerbockers (clothing)|knickers]] are short trousers that end just below the knee.  The breeches are required to have 10&amp;nbsp;cm of overlap with the jacket.  Most are equipped with suspenders (braces).
;Socks
:Fencing socks are long enough to cover the knee; some cover most of the thigh.
;Shoes
:Fencing shoes have flat soles, and are reinforced on the inside for the back foot, and in the heel for the front foot. The reinforcement prevents wear from lunging.
;Mask
:The fencing mask has a bib that protects the neck. The mask should support {{convert|12|kg|lb}} on the metal mesh and {{convert|350|N}} of penetration resistance on the bib. FIE regulations dictate that masks must withstand {{convert|25|kg|lb}} on the mesh and {{convert|1600|N}} on the bib. Some modern masks have a see-through visor in the front of the mask. These have been used at high level competitions (World Championships etc.), however, they are currently banned in foil and épée by the FIE, following a 2009 incident in which a visor was pierced during the European Junior Championship competition. There are foil, sabre, and three-weapon masks.
;Chest protector
:A chest protector, made of plastic, is worn by female fencers and, sometimes, by boys. Fencing instructors also wear them, as they are hit far more often during training than their students. In foil fencing, the hard surface of a chest protector decreases the likelihood that a hit registers.
;Lamé
:A lamé is a layer of electrically conductive material worn over the fencing jacket in foil and sabre fencing. The lamé covers the entire target area, and makes it easier to determine whether a hit fell within the target area. (In épée fencing the lamé is unnecessary, since the target area spans the competitor's entire body.) In sabre fencing, the lamé's sleeves end in a straight line across the wrist; in foil fencing, the lamé is sleeveless. A [[body cord]] is necessary to register scoring. It attaches to the weapon and runs inside the jacket sleeve, then down the back and out to the scoring box. In sabre and foil fencing, the body cord connects to the lamé in order to create a circuit to the scoring box.
;Sleeve
:An instructor or master may wear a protective sleeve or a leg leather to protect their fencing arm or leg, respectively.

Traditionally, the fencer's uniform is white, and an instructor's uniform is black. This may be due to the occasional pre-electric practice of covering the point of the weapon in dye, soot, or colored chalk in order to make it easier for the referee to determine the placing of the touches.  As this is no longer a factor in the electric era, the FIE rules have been relaxed to allow colored uniforms (save black). The guidelines also limit the permitted size and positioning of sponsorship logos.

===Electric equipment===
A set of electric fencing equipment is required to participate in electric fencing. Electric equipment in fencing varies depending on the weapon with which it is used in accordance. The main component of a set of electric equipment is the [[body cord]]. The '''body cord''' serves as the connection between a fencer and a reel of wire that is part of a system for electrically detecting that the weapon has touched the opponent. There are two types: one for [[Épée (Fencing)|épée]], and one for [[Foil (fencing)|foil]] and [[Sabre (fencing)|sabre]].

Épée body cords consist of two sets of three prongs each connected by a wire. One set plugs into the fencer's weapon, with the other connecting to the reel. Foil and sabre body cords have only two prongs (or a twist-lock bayonet connector) on the weapon side, with the third wire connecting instead to the fencer's lamé. The need in foil and sabre to distinguish between on and off-target touches requires a wired connection to the valid target area.

A body cord consists of three wires known as the A, B, and C lines. At the reel connector (and both connectors for Épée cords) The B pin is in the middle, the A pin is 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm to one side of B, and the C pin is 2&amp;nbsp;cm to the other side of B. This asymmetrical arrangement ensures that the cord cannot be plugged in the wrong way around.

In foil, the A line is connected to the lamé and the B line runs up a wire to the tip of the weapon. The B line is normally connected to the C line through the tip. When the tip is depressed, the circuit is broken and one of three things can happen:
[[File:Sabre Body Cord.png|thumb|A foil/sabre body cord. Left to right: alligator clip, connection to reel, connection to weapon.]]
* The tip is touching your opponent's [[Lamé (fencing)|lamé]] (their A line): Valid touch
* The tip is touching your opponent's weapon or the grounded strip: nothing, as the current is still flowing to the C line.
* The tip is not touching either  of the above: Off-target hit (white light).
In Épée, the A and B lines run up separate wires to the tip (there is no lamé). When the tip is depressed, it connects the A and B lines, resulting in a valid touch. However, if the tip is touching your opponents weapon (their C line) or the grounded strip, nothing happens when it is depressed, as the current is redirected to the C line. Grounded strips are particularly important in Épée, as without one, a touch to the floor registers as a valid touch (rather than off-target as in Foil).

In Sabre, similarly to Foil, the A line is connected to the lamé, but both the B and C lines are connected to the body of the weapon. Any contact between your B/C line (doesn't matter which, as they are always connected) and your opponent's A line (their lamé) results in a valid touch. There is no need for grounded strips in Sabre, as hitting something other than your opponent's lame does nothing.
[[File:Lamé.png|thumb|A foil lamé conductive vest]]
In a professional fencing competition, a complete set of electric equipment is needed.

A complete set of foil electric equipment includes:
* An electric [[body cord]], which runs under the fencer's jacket on his/her dominate side. 
* An electric blade.
* A conductive lamé or electric vest.
* A conductive bib (often attached to the mask).
* An electric mask cord, connecting the conductive bib and the lamé. 
The electric equipment of sabre is very similar to that of foil. In addition, equipment used in sabre includes:
* A larger conductive lame.
* An electric sabre.
* A completely conductive mask.
* A conductive glove or overlay.
Épée fencers lack a lamé, conductive bib, and head cord due to their target area. Also, their body cords are constructed differently as described above. However, they possess all of the other components of a foil fencer's equipment.

==Foil, épée, and sabre techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhutta|first=Omar|year=2016|title=USA Fencing Rules|url=http://assets.ngin.com/attachments/document/0105/8552/2016-USA-Fencing-Rules.pdf|journal=United States Fencing Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
{{See also|Glossary of fencing}}
Techniques or movements in fencing can be divided into two categories: offensive and defensive. Some techniques can fall into both categories (''e.g.'' the beat). Certain techniques are used offensively, with the purpose of landing a hit on your opponent while holding the right of way (foil and sabre). Others are used defensively, to protect against a hit or obtain the right of way.

The attacks and defences may be performed in countless combinations of feet and hand actions. For example, fencer A attacks the arm of fencer B, drawing a high outside parry; fencer B then follows the parry with a high line riposte. Fencer A, expecting that, then makes his own parry by pivoting his blade under fencer B's weapon (from straight out to more or less straight down), putting fencer B's tip off target and fencer A now scoring against the low line by angulating the hand upwards.

Whenever a point is scored, the fencers will go back to their starting mark. The fight will start again after the following commands have been given by the referee (in French in international settings): "En garde" (On guard), "Êtes-vous prêts ?" (Are you ready?), "Allez" (Fence!).

===Offensive===
* [[Attack (fencing)|Attack]]: A basic fencing technique, also called a thrust, consisting of the initial offensive action made by extending the arm and continuously threatening the opponent's target. They are four different attacks (straight thrust, disengage attack, counter-disengage attack and cutover)  In sabre, attacks are also made with a cutting action.
* Riposte:  An attack by the defender after a successful parry.  After the attacker has completed their attack, and it has been parried, the defender then has the opportunity to make an attack, and (at foil and sabre) take right of way.
* [[Feint]]: A false attack with the purpose of provoking a reaction from the opposing fencer.
* [[Lunge (fencing)|Lunge]]: A thrust while extending the front leg by using a slight kicking motion and propelling the body forward with the back leg.
* Beat attack: In foil and sabre, the attacker beats the opponent's blade to gain priority (right of way) and continues the attack against the target area.  In épée, a similar beat is made but with the intention to disturb the opponent's aim and thus score with a single light.
* Disengage: A blade action whereby the blade is moved around the opponent's blade to threaten a different part of the target or deceive a parry.
* Compound attack: An attack preceded by one or more feints which oblige the opponent to parry, allowing the attacker to deceive the parry.
* Continuation/renewal of Attack: A typical épée action of making a 2nd attack after the first attack is parried. This may be done with a change in line; for example, an attack in the high line (above the opponent's bellguard, such as the shoulder) is then followed with an attack to the low line (below the opponent's bellguard, such as the thigh, or foot); or from the outside line (outside the bellguard, such as outer arm) to the inside line (inside the bellguard, such as the inner arm or the chest). A second continuation is stepping slight past the parry and angulating the blade to bring the tip of the blade back on target. A renewal may also be direct (without a change of line or any further blade action), in which case it is called a remise. In foil or sabre, a renewal is considered to have lost right of way, and the defender's immediate riposte, if it lands, will score instead of the renewal.
* Flick: a technique used primarily in foil and épée.  It takes advantage of the extreme flexibility of the blade to use it like a whip, bending the blade so that it curves over and strikes the opponent with the point; this allows the fencer to hit an obscured part of the target (e.g., the back of the shoulder or, at épée, the wrist even when it is covered by the guard).  This technique has become much more difficult due to timing changes which require the point to stay depressed for longer to set off the light.

===Defensive===
* [[Parry (fencing)|Parry]]: Basic defence technique, block the opponent's weapon while it is preparing or executing an attack to deflect the blade away from the fencer's valid area and (in foil and sabre) to give fencer the right of way. Usually followed by a riposte, a return attack by the defender.
* Circle parry: A parry where the weapon is moved in a circle to catch the opponent's tip and deflect it away.
* Counter attack: A basic fencing technique of attacking your opponent while generally moving back out of the way of the opponent's attack.  Used quite often in épée to score against the attacker's hand/arm. More difficult to accomplish in foil and sabre unless one is quick enough to make the counterattack and retreat ahead of the advancing opponent without being scored upon, or by evading the attacking blade via moves such as the In Quartata (turning to the side) or Passata-sotto (ducking). Counterattacks can also be executed in opposition, grazing along the opponent's blade and deflecting it to cause the attack to miss.
* Point-in-line:  A specific position where the arm is straight and the point is threatening the opponent's target area. In foil and sabre, this gives one priority if the extension is completed before the opponent begins the final action of their attack.  When performed as a defensive action, the attacker must then disturb the extended weapon to re-take priority; otherwise the defender has priority and the point-in-line will win the touch if the attacker does not manage a single light.  In épée, there is no priority; the move may be used as a means by either fencer to achieve a double-touch and advance the score by 1 for each fencer. In all weapons, the point-in-line position is commonly used to slow the opponent's advance and cause them to delay the execution of their attack.

==Universities and schools==
{{See also|Collegiate Fencing| High School Fencing}}

Fencing has a long history with universities and schools for at least 500 years. At least one style of fencing, [[Academic fencing|Mensur]] in Germany, is practiced only within universities, notably at Heidelberg. University students compete internationally at the [[Universiade|World University Games]]. The United States holds two national level university tournaments including the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] championship and the [[USACFC]] National Championships&lt;ref&gt;[http://usacfc.org USACFC].in 's USACFC. Retrieved on 2012-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt; tournaments in the USA and the [[British Universities and Colleges Sport|BUCS]] fencing championships in the United Kingdom. Prior to advances in modern weaponry post World War I, the [[United States Cavalry]] taught swordsmanship (mounted and dismounted) in [[Fort Riley]], Kansas at its [[Mounted Service School]]. [[George S. Patton Jr.]], while still a young lieutenant, was named "[[Master of the Sword]]," an honor reserved for the top instructor. He invented what came to be known as the "Patton Saber," in 1913, based on his studies with M. Clery L'Adjutant, reputed to be the finest Fencing Master in Europe at the time. While teaching at Fort Riley, he wrote two training manuals teaching the art of swordsmanship to Army Cavalry Officers, "Saber Exercise 1914"&lt;ref&gt;Patton, George S. Jr. "Saber Exercise." Silver Spring, MD: Dale Street Books, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Diary of the Instructor in Swordsmanship." &lt;ref&gt;Patton, George S. Jr. "Diary of the Instructor in Swordsmanship." Silver Spring, MD: Dale Street Books, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Equipment costs and the relatively small scale of the sport limits university fencing to a small number of schools. National fencing organisations have set up programmes to encourage more students to fence. Examples include the Regional Youth Circuit program&lt;ref&gt;US Fencing Youth Development Website, [http://www.usfaryc.org/Welcome.html Regional Youth Circuit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712223939/http://www.usfaryc.org/Welcome.html |date=2007-07-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the USA and the Leon Paul Youth Development series in the UK.

In recent years, attempts have been made to introduce fencing to a wider and younger audience, by using foam and plastic swords, which require much less protective equipment. This makes it much less expensive to provide classes, and thus easier to take fencing to a wider range of schools than traditionally has been the case. There is even a competition series in Scotland – the Plastic-and-Foam Fencing FunLeague&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.paff.org.uk/ Plastic-and-Foam Fencing FunLeague] website.&lt;/ref&gt; – specifically for Primary and early Secondary school-age children using this equipment.

The UK hosts two national competitions in which schools compete against each other directly: the [[Public School (UK)|Public Schools]] Fencing Championship, a competition only open to Independent Schools,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicschoolsfencingchampionships.com/home.htm Home :: Public Schools Fencing Championships&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scottish Secondary Schools Championships, open to all secondary schools in Scotland. It contains both teams and individual events and is highly anticipated. Schools organise matches directly against one another and school age pupils can compete individually in the British Youth Championships.

Many universities in Ontario, Canada have fencing teams that participate in an annual inter-university competition called the OUA Finals.

===Venetian school of fencing===
The [[Venetian school of fencing]] is a style of fencing that occurred in Venice in the early 12th century,&lt;ref&gt;Энциклопедия оружия, Венделин Боехейм, Санкт-Петербург оркестр, 1995 - Всего страниц: 574&lt;/ref&gt; and prevailed until the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;La reinvenzione di Venezia: tradizioni cittadine negli anni ruggenti, Filippo Mariani, Francesco Stocco, Giorgio Crovato, Il poligrafo, 2007 - Всего страниц: 194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Школы и мастера фехтования. Благородное искусство владения клинком, Эгертон Кастл, Litres, 12 янв. 2017 г. - Всего страниц: 7632&lt;/ref&gt;

The basics of the Venetian fencing are expounded in the following five treatises:

* Giacomo di Grassi "The Reasons of Victorious Weapon Handling for Attack and Defense" (1570);

* Francesco Alfieri “The Art of Excellent Handling of the Sword” (1653);

* Camillo Agrippa "The Treatise on the Science of Weapons with Philosophical Reflections" (1553);

* Nicoletto Giganti  “School or Theater” (1606);

* Salvator Fabris "Fencing or the science of weapons" (1606)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Venetians were masters of the art, and shared with their colleagues of Bologna the sound principles of fencing known as Bolognese or Venetian.&lt;ref&gt;Venice: its individual growth from the earliest beginnings to the fall of the republic, Том 6, Pompeo Molmenti, A.C. McClurg &amp; Co., 1908&lt;/ref&gt; 
For the first time Venetian fencing was detailed in some directions, it was described the properties of different parts of the blade, which were used in defense and offense. With this approach, the swordsman had an idea of one thing, what now we calling like "center of percussion". It was suggested some divisions of a sword. The blade was divided into four parts, the first two parts from Ephesus should be used for protection; the third one near the center of the blow was used for striking; and the fourth part at the tip was used for pricking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===German school of fencing===
The German school of fencing is a historical combat system, a style of fencing that was widespread in the Holy Roman Empire and existed in the late Middle Ages, Renaissance and early Modern times (from the end of XIV to XVII century).

The first document of the German heritage, which describes the methods of fencing, is considered to be the Manuscript I.33 which was written around 1300&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = https://oleg-maltsev.com/ru/martial-arts/german/sources_of_german_fencing_part1/

|lang        = en 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Other variants==
Other variants include [[wheelchair fencing]] for those with disabilities, chair fencing, ''one-hit épée'' (one of the five events which constitute [[modern pentathlon]]) and the various types of non-Olympic competitive fencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.teamusa.org/home/us%20paralympics/sports/fencing.aspx|title=U.S. Paralympics {{!}} Sports {{!}} Wheelchair Fencing|work=Team USA|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chair fencing is similar to wheelchair fencing, but for the able bodied.  The opponents set up opposing chairs and fence while seated; all the usual rules of fencing are applied.  An example of the latter is the [[American Fencing League]] (distinct from the [[United States Fencing Association]]): the format of competitions is different and the right of way rules are interpreted in a different way. In a number of countries, school and university matches deviate slightly from the FIE format. A variant of the sport using toy [[lightsaber]]s earned national attention when [[ESPN2]] acquired the rights to a selection of matches and included it as part of its "ESPN8: The Ocho" programming block in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Steinberg|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/bold-strategy-cotton-espn-the-ocho-business-1202899209/#article-comments|title=Bold strategy, Cotton: Inside ESPN's crazy plans to turn 'The Ocho' into a business|work=Variety|date=August 8, 2018|accessdate=August 8, 2018|quote=ESPN had to acquire the rights to show two of the most random events on the schedule (...) and high-level light-saber dueling.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Singapore]] '''National Stadium''' ([[Bahasa Melayu|Malay]]: ''Stadium Nasional Singapura'') was located in [[Kallang]]. The stadium opened in July 1973 and officially closed on 30 June 2007, and was demolished in 2010–2011 to make way for the [[Singapore Sports Hub]] and the new [[National Stadium, Singapore|Singapore National Stadium]], which opened in 2014. For six to seven years between 2007 and 2014, sports events were temporarily held at the [[Marina Bay Floating Stadium]].

The stadium played host to many sporting, cultural, entertainment and national events, such as the [[Southeast Asian Games]] when it was hosted in Singapore, the Singapore Armed Forces Day, the [[Singapore Youth Festival]] Opening Ceremony, and the finals of the [[2004 Tiger Cup]]. The National Stadium was also the venue for the [[Singapore National Day Parade|National Day Parade]] 18 times (in 1976, 1980, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996 to 1999, 2001 to 2004, and 2006).

Since the stadium opened in 1973, the [[Singapore national football team]] played its home matches there. The stadium also hosted the final of the [[Singapore Cup]] since 1996. Additionally, the stadium was the home of the [[Singapore Lions]] that participated in domestic football in [[Malaysia]].

== Facilities ==
The National Stadium had an eight-lane running track and football field in addition to other miscellaneous facilities such as table tennis tables, a weights room and an auditorium, housed underneath the spectator stands.

While the facilities were often used for high-profile sporting events, they could also be used by members of the public and other local organizations for a nominal fee. For example, when not otherwise used, the running track could be used by joggers for [[Singapore dollar|S$]]0.50 per entry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssc.gov.sg/SportsWeb/sw_cat_details.jsp?type=9&amp;root=31&amp;cat=244&amp;artID=3593 Singapore Sports Council - National Stadium Facilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313143019/http://www.ssc.gov.sg/SportsWeb/sw_cat_details.jsp?type=9&amp;root=31&amp;cat=244&amp;artID=3593 |date=13 March 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters of the [[Singapore Sports Council]] used to be located at 15 Stadium Road.

== History ==

=== Conceptualisation ===
[[File:Kallang stadium zz.JPG|thumb|upright|One of the final football games played at Kallang, June 2007]]

Soon after the end of the Second World War, as Singapore moved towards self-government and independence, the clamour began for a national stadium.

Preliminary studies of possible sites began in the 1950s. Kallang Park was selected because of existing sport facilities in the immediate vicinity. In August 1965, preliminary work on the design of the Stadium began. By the end of 1965, considerable progress having been made to shelter people, educate the young and to find jobs for the swelling population, Minister [[Othman Wok]] announced the Government's intention to proceed with the construction of a national stadium of Olympic standards at Kallang, as the first phase of the National Sports Complex. The Minister told Parliament that the National Stadium would give a tremendous boost to the promotion of sports in Singapore and would help improve the Republic's image in international sports.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Funding ===
A state-owned lottery company, [[Singapore Pools]], was set up in 1968 to raise funds for the stadium. Proceeds from the Singapore Sweep and TOTO were used to pay a substantial part of the construction bill. Between 1968 and 1976, the company contributed [[Singapore dollar|S$]]14.5 million towards the project. Singapore Pools also helped the stadium repay a government loan of $7.8 million meant as start-up money for a stadium management corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singaporepools.com.sg/jsp/corporate/corporate_nationalstad.jsp Singapore Pools, The Beginning of the National Stadium].&lt;/ref&gt; Following the completion of the National Stadium, Singapore Pools remained a major sponsor of stadium, as well as the [[Singapore National Day Parade|National Day Parade]].

=== Construction ===
On 7 December 1966, in the year that Singapore celebrated its first [[National Day (Singapore)|National Day]], Othman drove the first pile into the ground. For the next three and a half years, piling was done to lay the foundations. Work had to be delayed due to bad weather for about a month. By the end of 1970, the stadium was three-quarters completed and was starting to take its definitive shape. Thirty-six steps, each {{convert|76|m}} wide, formed an impressive entrance; and a cauldron was built within the stadium to carry a flame that would burn on special events and on the opening of the stadium. By the end of June 1973 when the stadium was completed, 300,000 bags of cement, 3,000,000 bricks and 4,500 tons of steel and timber had been used. The new stadium was opened to the public for the first time on 19 July 1973.

=== Redevelopment ===
Plans were made to demolish the stadium and build a multipurpose, {{convert|35.6|ha}} [[Singapore Sports Hub]] in its place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssc.gov.sg/SportsWeb/sw_mc_details.jsp?artid=5118&amp;catname=Features Singapore Sports Council, News on the redevelopment of the National Stadium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913052330/http://www.ssc.gov.sg/SportsWeb/sw_mc_details.jsp?artid=5118&amp;catname=Features |date=13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Demolition works began in the second half of 2007, and the new Sports Hub was eventually completed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patwant Singh|title=Consortium reveals horseshoe-shaped iconic design for Sports Hub|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/267210/1/.html|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|date=29 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three finalist consortia submitted redevelopment plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Satish Cheney|title=All 3 proposals for new Sports Hub 'truly spectacular': Vivian Balakrishnan|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/267019/1/.html|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=28 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 [[ASEAN Football Championship]] was the last major event held at the National Stadium before its redevelopment.

=== Closure ===
On 30 June 2007, a closing ceremony titled ''Field of Dreams – A Tribute to the National Stadium'' was held at the stadium.&lt;ref name="ST31052007"&gt;"A tribute to the Old Lady of Kallang", ''[[The Straits Times]]'', 31 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 45,000 people attended the event, together with [[President of Singapore|President]] [[S R Nathan]], [[Members of the Singapore Parliament|members of the Cabinet]] and Singapore athletes, past and present.&lt;ref name="Marc Lim"&gt;Marc Lim, "Sun sets on the Grand Old Lady", ''[[The Straits Times|The Sunday Times]]'', 1 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Before the ceremony, a football match featuring ex-internationals from Singapore and Malaysia like [[Quah Kim Song]], [[Terry Pathmanathan]], [[Samat Allapitchay]], [[V. Sundramoorthy]], [[David Lee (Singaporean footballer)|David Lee]], [[Dollah Kassim]], [[Soh Chin Aun]], [[Santokh Singh]], [[Chow Siew Wai]] and [[K. Gunalan]] was played.&lt;ref name="Terrence Voon"&gt;Terrence Voon, "Old foes' nostalgic farewell to their field of dreams", ''[[The Straits Times|The Sunday Times]]'', 1 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The match was followed by the highlight of the evening, an international friendly between [[ASEAN]] champions [[Singapore national football team|Singapore]] and the [[Asian Cup]] bound Australian team, the [[Socceroos]]. The Australians won 3-0 with goals scored by [[Premier League|English Premier League]] players [[Mark Viduka]] (50, 86 mins) and [[Harry Kewell]] (75 min).&lt;ref name="Leonard Lim"&gt;Leonard Lim, "Thanks for a great match, mate", ''[[The Straits Times|The Sunday Times]]'', 1 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not the last football match to be played in the stadium as it was subsequently used for 11 football matches. The very last goal scored at the stadium was scored by [[Gholamreza Rezaei]] of [[Iran]] in a 1-3 loss for the hosts against the Iranian national team in an Asian Cup qualifying match on 6 January 2010.

==Demolition==
In 29 September 2010: The former National Stadium started its demolition to make way for the construction of the Sports Hub. Its demolition had since completed by February 2011.

==Aftermath==
=== Post closure ===
In February 2013, uniquely designed benches made from the wooden planks from the former National Stadium were presented to the public, as a meaningful way to commemorate this historic landmark. These designs were part of the [http://www.bench.sg/ bench project] organized by local creative practice FARM, and jointly presented by Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Singapore Furniture Industries Council. Five of the designs were winning entries of the design competition which invited the public to submit designs for benches using the seating planks from the former National Stadium. The rest of the designs were specially created by commissioned local designers from various design fields.

The benches can now be found in [http://www.ura.gov.sg/MS/pickabench/installed-locations.aspx various public spaces] such as Singapore River, Marina Bay, Gillman Barracks, Esplanade, Gardens by the Bay and the URA Centre.

'''Glazier''' (first name and dates unknown) was an English [[cricket]]er who played in [[first-class cricket]] for [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] and [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] during the 1760s. He is recorded in the [[Caterham Cricket Club|Caterham]] v. Hambledon match at [[Guildford Bason]] in July 1769.&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Glazier had established his reputation by 1768, he must have been active for some years previously and his career may have begun in the 1750s. He is not mentioned in 1770s reports and very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports before then. There are no other references to Glazier.

'''Icahn Stadium''' is a 5,000 seat [[track and field]] and multipurpose facility located on [[Randalls and Wards Islands|Randalls Island]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].  Designed within the former site of [[Downing Stadium]], it opened on April 23, 2005. Icahn Stadium is named after American businessman [[Carl Icahn]], who made a $10 million donation towards the construction of the new stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brick |first=Michael |title=Children Celebrate Opening of Stadium |work=The New York Times |date=April 24, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/nyregion/24ichan.html |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium features an [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) Class 1 certified running track with a 400-meter Mondo Super X Performance surface, and it has been the site of many international, national, and regional track and field events.

==Background==
Icahn Stadium was built to replace [[Downing Stadium]], which was originally opened in 1936 as part of a larger [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|New York City Parks]] project that included the construction of the [[Triborough Bridge]].  The opening of Downing Stadium made history as the facility hosted the U.S. Olympic Trials in 1936, at which [[Jesse Owens]] qualified for two events in the upcoming [[Berlin Olympics]]. Downing Stadium also made history in 1939 as the site of the first televised college football game, [[1939 Waynesburg vs. Fordham football game|Fordham vs. Waynesburg]]. The site went was subsequently home to the [[New York Cosmos (1970–85)|New York Cosmos]] soccer team,  as well as various sporting events and summer concerts. The stadium lights, which had been taken from [[Ebbets Field]] after it was torn down,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=500 Lights From Ebbets Field Will Shine on Randalls Island |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 4, 1960 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/06/04/archives/500-lights-from-ebbets-field-will-shine-on-randalls-island.html |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; were left in place to light the new field.

After years of use, the old facility was in need of renovation.  In order to maximize the potential of the site, the old stadium was razed, and Icahn Stadium was constructed in its place along with Field 10, a [[FIFA]]-certified [[Association football pitch|soccer field]], on the north side.  The track and field built is one of only five [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] Class 1-certified tracks in the United States (along with [[Hutsell-Rosen Track]], [[Hayward Field]], [[John McDonnell Field]] and Rock Chalk Park).  The 5,000 seat stadium is partially sheltered by a cantilevered roof, and is illuminated by a pair of lighting towers.  In addition, the soccer field on the north of the stadium is outfitted with a scoreboard, fencing, lighting, and bleachers for spectator events.

Run by the Randalls Island Park Alliance (RIPA), Icahn Stadium serves the residents of New York City and beyond. It houses some of RIPA’s various Randalls Island Kids (RIK) programs, including the Jesse Owens track club, RIK Dance programs, and components of RIK summer camp.  RIPA was founded in 1992 as a public–private partnership to work on behalf of Randalls Island Park.  The Alliance, in conjunction with City leadership and the local community, works to realize the Island’s unique potential by developing sports and recreational facilities, restoring its vast natural environment, reclaiming and maintaining parkland, and sponsoring community-linked programs for the children of New York City. RIPA runs free youth sports programs that bring over 14,000 under-resourced public school children from [[Harlem]] and the [[South Bronx]] to the island annually.

==Track and field==
Since its opening, Icahn Stadium has hosted more than 200,000 high school, college and professional athletes and spectators during the track season.  Each year, the number of meets and events that are scheduled has grown, bringing larger numbers of people to the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randalls Island Park Alliance|title=Icahn Stadium Records|url=http://randallsisland.org/icahn-stadium/records|publisher=Randalls Island Park Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the [[Adidas Grand Prix|Reebok Grand Prix]] was created and held at the stadium.  Currently known as the Adidas Grand Prix of the [[IAAF Diamond League]], the annual summer tournament welcomes top runners from around the world.  From its inception it has distinguished itself as one of top meets to feature Olympic and World Champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diamond League|title=Adidas Grand Prix History|url=http://www.diamondleague-newyork.com/Meet-Info/Who-we-are/History/|publisher=Diamond League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On May 31, 2008, Jamaican sprinter [[Usain Bolt]] set the then world record in the [[100 metres|100m]] on the Icahn Stadium track with a time of 9.72 seconds at the [[Reebok Grand Prix]], .02 seconds faster than the previous record held by his countryman, [[Asafa Powell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Longman |first=Jeré |title=Jamaican Sets World Record in 100 Meters at 9.72 |work=The New York Times |date=June 1, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/sports/othersports/01track.html |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On June 9, 2012, Kenyan runner [[David Rudisha]] set the record in the [[800 metres|800m]] in the U.S. with a time of 1:41.74 seconds at the Adidas Grand Prix.

==Lacrosse==
In December 2012, the [[New York Lizards]] of [[Major League Lacrosse]] announced that the team would play two home games at Icahn Stadium for the [[2013 Major League Lacrosse season|2013 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MLL|title=Long Island Lizards change name to New York Lizards|url=http://www.majorleaguelacrosse.com/press-release/6421/long-island-lizards-change-name-to-new-york-lizards|publisher=Major League Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reddicliffe|first=Steve|title=Pro Lacrosse Team Hopes It Can Gain a Foothold|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/sports/lizards-lacrosse-team-to-play-two-games-on-randalls-island.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 4, 2013|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The team played at the venue on June 6 and 13, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Letterii|first=Marie|title=Lizards 2013 Schedule Released|url=http://www.nylizards.com/news/6567/lizards-2013-schedule-released/|publisher=New York Lizards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soccer==
On June 27, 2013, the New York Cosmos revealed that their annual [[Cosmos Copa]] NYC soccer tournament would hold its final at the stadium, as many of the games were held at Randalls Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cosmos|title=Fixtures for Cosmos Copa group stage revealed|url=http://cosmoscopa.com/news/fixtures-cosmos-copa-group-stage-revealed|publisher=New York Cosmos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to scheduling issues, the final was relocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cosmos|title=Venue change: Cosmos Copa final moved to Randalls Island Field 70|url=http://cosmoscopa.com/news/venue-change-cosmos-copa-final-moved-randalls-island-field-70|publisher=New York Cosmos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the site was used as a venue for the 2014 Cosmos Copa group stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cosmos|title=The Tournament|url=http://cosmoscopa.com/tournament|publisher=New York Cosmos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NYC Olympics==
Icahn Stadium was incorporated as a training center into the [[New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bagli |first=Charles V. |title=Without Games, the Sites Pass From Future to Never |work=The New York Times |date=July 7, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/nyregion/07venues.html |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Future New York City Olympic bids will also potentially use the stadium as a training facility, because it already meets IAAF specifications.

'''Mianne Bagger''' (born in 25 December 1966) is a professional golfer from [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=WISPAJ&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Love |first1=Adam |first2=Seung-Yup |last2=Lim |first3=Joy T. |last3=DeSensi |url=http://kinesiology.msstate.edu/faculty/bios/pdf/Love_Lim_DeSensi(2009).pdf |title=Mianne Bagger: A Transitioned Woman's Efforts for Inclusion in Professional Golf |journal=Women in Sport and Physical Activity Journal |volume=18 |number=1 |date=Spring 2009 |pages=68–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagger moved with her family to Australia in 1979, when she was twelve and started to again play golf fully in 1998, first as an amateur player, then turning professional in 2003. In 2004, by playing in the [[Women's Australian Open]], she became the first openly [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioned]] woman to play in a professional golf tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon P. R. |last=Jenkins |title=Sports Science Handbook: A-H |publisher=Multi-science Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=978-0906522363}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also became the first [[trans woman]] to qualify for the [[Ladies European Tour]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/golf/3980131.stm | title=Transsexual golfer wins Tour spot| date=2004-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; also becoming the first high-profile transitioned woman to qualify for a professional sports tour since [[Renee Richards]] joined the [[Women's Tennis Association]] tour during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golftoday.co.uk/news/yeartodate/news04/bagger.html |title=Mianne Bagger creates history on the LET |publisher=GolfToday |year=2004 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been instrumental in gaining eligibility for transitioned women to compete on professional golf tours.&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/golf/12/30/golf.lawless.bagger.lpga/ |title=Transsexual golfers prove drivers for change |publisher=CNN |date=10 February 2011 |first1=Greg |last1=Duke |first2=Paul |last2=Gittings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her efforts, many professional golf organizations have amended their practices, but the policies generally still constrict rules of gender variance, and view atypically gendered women as something other than women.&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt; Bagger has sought to remove gender policies, specifically female-at-birth, as more problematic than helpful, and encourage sports organizations to see "a fuller understanding and acceptance of gender variance and human diversity."&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt;

==Early life and amateur career==
Bagger was born in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark on 25 December 1966. She took up golf at the age of eight. At the age of 14, she was pictured with golfer [[Greg Norman]] during a golf clinic. Bagger moved with her family to Australia in 1979.&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt; In 1992 she started [[hormone replacement therapy]] and in 1995, had [[sex reassignment surgery]].&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCNews/&gt; In 1998 she returned to golf as an amateur in Australia. She was open about her life and played in various amateur events around Adelaide and was invited to join the women's South Australian State Squad.&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt; After winning the 1999 South Australian State Amateur the media attention increased.&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt; 

Bagger played for the state team of South Australia (1999–2002) achieving a national top-ten rank for amateur women.&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt; Various players from time to time, were still concerned about Bagger having an "unfair advantage"&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt; The suspicion was that "if I happen to do well or win a tournament, that it was because of an unfair advantage."&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt; She had researched the issues herself and, also through personal experience, realised that concerns were unfounded. All organizations that prevented her from competing had never actually done any research but had merely adopted a blanket ruling without question.&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt; Bagger answered that many people are not aware of physiological aspects of [[gender variant]] conditions and the issues related to [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]]. Bagger again won the South Australian Amateur in 2001 and 2002.

Bagger felt she had taken her amateur career as far as it could go and was looking to turn professional. She found that rules would prevent her from competing professionally in Australia and "on most golf tours around the world."&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt; While still an amateur, she was offered the chance to play in the 2004 [[Women's Australian Open]].&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt; This led to a front-page story in Sydney, which prompted Bagger to hold a news conference the day before the tournament to answer questions and present information on transitioned and [[transgender]] people.&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt;

==Professional career and campaigning for trans rights==
After becoming the 6th best player in Australia in 2003, she continued as a professional.

* In 2004 she played the Swedish Telia Tour and finished twice in the top 10.
* In 2005 she played her first tournament on the Ladies European Tour. She finished in the 35th place
* In 2006 she finished on the 91st place
*In 2007 she finished as 54th

Her coach is Australian Andrew Mowatt at the Royal Fremantle GC in Perth.

At Bagger's first tournament as a professional, [[Laura Davies]] and [[Rachel Teske]] were among players who were happy to allow Bagger to compete.&lt;ref name=ABCNews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Health/story?id=982855&amp;page=1 |title=Transgender Golfer Still Faces Barriers |work=ABC News |date=27 July 2005 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagger caused a media stir in 2004 when she played the Australia Women's Open and had intentions also of joining the [[Australian Ladies Professional Golf]] Tour (ALPG Tour).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Claire F. |title=Gender Verification and Gender Policies in Elite Sport Eligibility and "Fair Play" |journal=Journal of Sport &amp; Social Issues |volume=35 |number=4 |year=2011 |pages=400–419 |url=http://jss.sagepub.com/content/35/4/400.abstract |doi=10.1177/0193723511426293}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a tournament in the United States, she met [[Ty Votaw]], the commissioner of the [[LPGA Tour]], who was later questioned about their policies stating "right now, our rule is that they have to be born women." Bagger notes that "they obviously don't consider that I meet that condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/sportsf/stories/s1059427.htm |title=I Am Woman ! |first=Warwick |last=Hadfield |date=5 March 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405170826/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/sportsf/stories/s1059427.htm |archivedate=5 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her comment reflects current medical findings that there are no physical advantages for [[transitioned women]] in the sport. Votaw left the possibility open for that rule to change in the future.

The 2004 ruling by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) regarding transitioned athletes led to a re-examination of rules in many sports.&lt;ref name=EEB&gt;Buzuvis, Erin E., [http://digitalcommons.law.wne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1257&amp;context=facschol&amp;sei-redir=1 "Transsexual and Intersex Athletes, in Sexual Minorities in Sports: Prejudice at Play,"] (Melanie L.

In September 2004, after continued lobbying by Bagger, the [[Ladies European Tour]] voted on amending their membership entry criteria, allowing Bagger to compete on tour. Later that year, the ALPG also voted in favour of changing their constitution to remove the 'female at birth' clause, thus making Bagger eligible to join the [[ALPG Tour]] in Australia. On 9 February 2005, the [[Ladies Golf Union]] also announced a policy change allowing Bagger to compete in the [[Women's British Open]]. On 21 March 2005, the [[United States Golf Association]] announced it adopted a new 'gender policy' that allows transitioned athletes to compete in USGA golf championships, including the upcoming [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Women's Open]]. In 2010, the LPGA amended their bylaws and removed the 'female at birth' entry condition. Although the various policy changes have enabled transitioned athletes to compete, the policies remain under review.&lt;ref name=EEB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Teetzel |first=Sarah |title=On transgendered athletes, fairness and doping: An international challenge |journal=Sport in Society |volume=9 |number=2 |date=April 2006 |pages=227–251 |doi=10.1080/17430430500491280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagger, along with a few high-profile athletes and a growing number of medical professionals and researchers around the world, continue to lobby the IOC, IAAF, WADA et al. in their approach to embracing transitioned athletes.&lt;ref name=EEB/&gt; Bagger also shares that many of these decisions are made by popular vote of members, often professionals in their sport, who are not doctors or medical professionals, and have no relevant medical training.&lt;ref name=WISPAJ/&gt;

'''Montana Raceway Park''' is a [[motorsport]]s facility located near [[Kalispell, Montana]], in the state's [[The Flathead|Flathead Valley]] region. It features a 1/4-mile-long high-banked oval track paved with [[asphalt]]. Seating at the facility accommodates 4,000 [[Fan (person)#Sports|spectators]] and parking areas can stage more than 100 race teams.&lt;ref name=details&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtracewaypark.com/track-info/|title=Montana Raceway Park Track Info|publisher=montanaracewaypark.com|accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[racetrack]] opened on May 1, 1991, as '''Raceway Park'''. During its first year, the facility also carried the names '''Kalispell Raceway Park''' and '''Flathead Valley Raceway Park'''. Weekly [[Auto racing|auto races]] and specialty events are currently the main uses for the facility.&lt;ref name=schedule&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtracewaypark.com/events/|title=Montana Raceway Park Schedule of Races for 2008|publisher=montanaracewaypark.com|accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drivers from the [[northwestern United States like Alex Lessor, Agni Howell, and Owen Riddle ]] and [[Canada such as Clint Habart]] travel to Montana Raceway Park for the annual Coors Light Montana 200, a racing event hosted by the racetrack each year since the track opened.&lt;ref name="racingwest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racingwest.com/news/articles/23787-drivers-arrive-for-20th-annual-coors-light.html|title=DRIVERS ARRIVE FOR 20TH ANNUAL COORS LIGHT MONTANA 200|publisher=racingwest.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a field of approximately 40–50 drivers competes for the 24 positions available in the race, which has yielded more than $50,000 in prize money during past years.&lt;ref name="montanaracewaypark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montanaracewaypark.com/news/index.cfm?ArticleID=265|title=Montana Raceway Park|publisher=montanaracewaypark.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other racing at the track includes the [[NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West]],&lt;ref name="nascar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hometracks.nascar.com/races/NCWSW|title=NASCAR Home Tracks &amp;#124; The Soul of NASCAR|publisher=hometracks.nascar.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian Super Truck Racing Series&lt;ref name="supertruckracingseries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supertruckracingseries.com/schedule.html|title=supertruckracingseries.com|publisher=supertruckracingseries.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local divisions of [[Stock car racing#Late Model|Super Late Models]], [[Stock car racing#Super Stock|Super Stocks]], Bombers, Hobby Stocks, Hornets, [[Legends car racing|Legends]], and [[Bandolero racing|Bandoleros]].&lt;ref name=schedule/&gt;

Beyond racing, the facility hosts other sports competitions and music performances. [[Foghat]], [[Blue Öyster Cult]], [[Eddie Money]], and [[Alice Cooper]] have entertained crowds at the racetrack.&lt;ref name="montanaracewaypark2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montanaracewaypark.com/concerts/|title=Montana Raceway Park Concerts|publisher=montanaracewaypark.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20765">'''Pitch quantification''' is the attempt to describe the quality of a pitch using a single numeric value based on [[wikt:quantifiable|quantifiable]] aspects of an individual [[pitch (baseball)|baseball pitch]]. There are two main kinds of pitch quantification. The first is outcome oriented. This means that the result of a given pitch (i.e., [[Base on balls|walk]], [[Out (baseball)|out]], [[home run]], etc.) is a component used to calculate the overall numeric value that describes the quality of the pitch. The other kind of pitch quantification does not consider the outcome of a pitch when calculating quality. Rather, it is [[Batting (baseball)|batter]] independent. Its quality can be assessed without regard to what the batter does with the pitch.

In 2006, [[PITCHf/x]] cameras were installed in every [[MLB.com|MLB]] stadium. These cameras are able to track “[[velocity]], movement, release point, spin, and pitch location”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is PITCHF/x?|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/library/misc/pitch-fx/|website=FanGraphs}}&lt;/ref&gt; on every pitch thrown. When this data was released to the public, many different attempts at pitch quantification began appearing. In 2010, Nick Steiner explained that [[pitcher|pitchers]] have relatively very little control over their pitches due to the fact that so many other factors affect a pitch, such as the [[Batting (baseball)|batter]], the [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]], [[Baseball positions|the defense]], and the environment. The task of [[Sabermetrics|baseball statistics]] attempting to quantify a pitch is to isolate the performance of the pitcher from the factors out of his control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steiner|first1=Nick|title=Beyond DIPS|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/working-title/|website=The Hardball Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, many different baseball statisticians have attempted to create a statistic that does this.

== Linear Pitch Weights ==
Linear Weights, or batting runs, is a central concept to baseball analysis. Linear Weights is a type of baseball statistic that uses “a weighted system for measuring the impact of hitting events.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=J.T.|title=Understanding Linear Weights|url=https://triplesalley.wordpress.com/2011/03/09/understanding-linear-weights/|website=Triples Alley}}&lt;/ref&gt; They compare a particular individual player’s ability with an average player’s ability. Ferdinand Cole Lane first began exploring linear weights and created the initial weighted system. Later, George Lindsey developed a run expectancy matrix, “which tells us the probability of scoring from a particular base-out state.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=J.T.|title=Understanding Linear Weights|url=https://triplesalley.wordpress.com/2011/03/09/understanding-linear-weights/|website=Triples Alley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Pete Palmer expanded on Lindsey’s work and created the Linear Weights System.

[[Count (baseball)|Pitch count]] is an essential element of Linear Weights. The pitch count is important because the quality of a player’s at-bat will vary depending on the pitch count. For example, if a batter is thrown the first pitch of the at-bat (1-0 count), his batting run will be higher than the average batting run. However, if the first ball thrown is a strike (0-1 count), then the batting run is lower than average. Simply put, Linear Weights quantify the fact that teams are more likely to score more runs in situations such as bases loaded and no outs, than in situations such as man on first and two outs. To obtain the values assigned to each base-out situation, “the average increase in run expectancy from each event” is taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=J.T.|title=Understanding Linear Weights|url=https://triplesalley.wordpress.com/2011/03/09/understanding-linear-weights/|website=Triples Alley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are the value relative to average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linear Weights|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/library/principles/linear-weights/|website=FanGraphs}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Linear weights are merely the '''empirical''' average impact an event has towards the run-scoring process.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=J.T.|title=Understanding Linear Weights|url=https://triplesalley.wordpress.com/2011/03/09/understanding-linear-weights/|website=Triples Alley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following table shows the run value for any particular pitch count.

Pete Palmer explained Linear Weights in the following way:

     ''"What Linear Weights does is to take very offensive event and treat it in terms of its impact upon the team- an average team, so that a man does not benefit in his individual record for having the good fortune to bat cleanup with the Brewers or suffer for batting cleanup with the Mets.  The relationship of individual performance to team play is stated poorly or not at all in conventional baseball statistics.  In Linear Weights it is crystal clear: the linear progression, the sum, of the various offensive events, when weighted by their accurately predicted run values, will total the runs contributed by that batter or that team beyond the league average.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=J.T.|title=Understanding Linear Weights|url=https://triplesalley.wordpress.com/2011/03/09/understanding-linear-weights/|website=Triples Alley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, suppose that a batter hits the [[Baseball (ball)|ball]] and runs to first base when the count is 0-2 (2 strikes). In order to calculate the linear weight of this pitch, we must compare this run with the average run. An average [[Single (baseball)|single]] is worth &lt;math&gt;0.47&lt;/math&gt; batting runs. The value of a single on a 0-2 count is &lt;math&gt;-0.106&lt;/math&gt;, according to Table 1. The final value is calculated by subtracting the value of the count when the ball was put in play from the value of the [[At bat|plate appearance]] according to [[Run batted in|batting runs]]. Thus, &lt;math&gt;0.47 - (-0.106) = 0.58&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=John|title=Searching for the game's best pitch|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/searching-for-the-games-best-pitch/|website=The Hardball Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== cLWTS ==
An adaptation of Linear Weights was put forward by Garrett Chiado in January 2016. He introduced a statistic called Contextual Pitch Type Linear Weights (cLWTS). Chiado, being unsatisfied with the inability of Linear Weights to give predictive value to pitching, sought a statistic that put pitches into context and provided an explanation for the correlation between pitch values and sequencing. What makes cLWTS different from traditional linear weights is that cLWTS recognizes that a particular pitch does not fully determine the outcome of that pitch. There are other factors that affect the outcome of a pitch which are unrelated to the quality of the pitch itself. Thus, cLWTS takes into account the entire context of what happens after the pitch is thrown and only acknowledge “the necessary weight of how much responsibility the pitcher truly deserves. When doing this, we also want to control for the externalities of the current game state and other environmental factors. Ultimately, cLWTS grades on a cumulative basis and on a per pitch basis for both pitchers and hitters, judging on the change in run expectancy for each pitch type.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chiado|first1=Garrett|title=Introducing cLWTS: Putting Pitch Data Into Context|url=http://www.sabermagician.com/introducing-clwts/|website=The Sabermagician}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of this particular statistic lies in its predictive power. However, cLWTS is subject to much of the same limitations as the ERA metric due to the fact that cLWTS simply removes pitches that included one or more errors on the play. In other words, pitchers are being penalized for “fielding and throwing errors by their defenders.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chiado|first1=Garrett|title=Introducing cLWTS: Putting Pitch Data into Context|url=http://www.sabermagician.com/introducing-clwts/|website=The Sabermagician}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correcting this flaw in cLWTS is currently in progress.

== Jeremy Greenhouse’s Stuff ==
One of the earliest methods of pitch quantification, Jeremy Greenhouse’s “Stuff”, was published in 2009, shortly following the release of the Pitchf/x data to the public in 2008. This attempt at quantifying a pitcher’s ability uses the response variable of expected run value and three independent variables: velocity, horizontal movement, and vertical movement. A loess regression is performed on these variables to obtain a numeric value to describe the pitcher’s stuff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenhouse|first1=Jeremy|title=On That Stuff|url=http://baseballanalysts.com/archives/2009/09/on_that_stuff.php|website=The Baseball Analysts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Leaderboards Greenhouse generated do not contain many of the expected top pitchers. Beyond the generation of Leaderboards, no continuing work has been done on this method of pitch quantification.

== Roegele ==
In March 2013, Jon Roegele sought to begin by looking at pitches within the strike zone to determine what a successful pitch looks like, then work backwards to determine how well a pitcher is executing pitches that have the qualities of being successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roegele|first1=Jon|title=Strike Zone Pitch Quality, Part 1: Location|url=http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2013/3/29/4153440/strike-zone-pitch-quality-part-i-location-pitchfx-sabermetrics?_ga=1.61424431.282523674.1463019291|website=SB Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main variable he considered was location. Roegele determined that the two most important factors that play into location are [[Category:Baseball pitches|pitch type]] and the pitcher-batter handedness combination. Unlike Linear Weights, this statistic does not use pitch count. Rather, Roegele split the strike zone into 9 sections. He calculated a number to represent the success of any pitch that enters any one of the nine sections based on the pitch type and pitcher-batter handedness combination for the given pitch.  This statistic is also batter-independent. It does not take into account the outcome of the pitch, only how well the pitcher is locating their pitch in the strike zone. However, when compared to well-established pitching metrics, this statistic did not fare well. Later in 2013, Roegele added velocity to his statistic in an attempt to refine it and make it more compatible with other metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roegele|first1=Jon|title=Pitch Quality Part II: Strike Zone Location and Now with Velocity!|url=http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2013/4/12/4206754/pitch-quality-part-ii-strike-zone-location-velocity-pitchfx-sabermetrics?_ga=1.169110562.282523674.1463019291|website=SB Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roegele believes that the next step in refining this statistic is to begin looking at pitches outside of the strike zone. As of October 2015, Roegele continues to fine-tune his statistic by adding variables such as temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roegele|first1=Jon|title=The 2015 Strike Zone|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/the-2015-strike-zone/|website=The Hardball Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== QOP ==
[[Quality of pitch|Quality of Pitch]], or QOP, is a statistic developed by Dr. Jason Wilson and Jarvis Greiner in 2014. They sought to create a statistic that would produce a universal measurement of the quality of a pitch independent of its outcome, pitch context, or pitch type. To do this, three key qualities of a pitch are used: [[Trajectory|trajectory]], location, and speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson/Greiner|first1=Jason/Wayne|title=Pitch Quantification Part I|url=http://www.qopbaseball.com/about.html|website=QOP Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes QOP completely objective because each of these variables are measurable using [[PITCHf/x]] data. The scale for QOP is roughly 0 to 10. The historical [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] data from 2008 to 2015 has a [[Mean|mean]] of about 4.5 and [[Median|median]] of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson/Greiner|first1=Jason/Wayne|title=Pitch Quantification Part I|url=http://www.qopbaseball.com/about.html|website=QOP Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to develop QOP, they first developed the Greiner Index. The Greiner Index (GI) is on the 0 to 100 scale and it rated pitches based on their level of difficulty for the batter to hit. The Greiner Index is calculated using the following formula, derived from a multiple regression model:

''rating = -2.51rise + 1.88breakpoint – 0.47knee_dist + 0.51total break''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson/Greiner|first1=Jason/Jarvis|title=A Curveball Index: Quantification of Breaking Balls for Pitchers|url=http://chance.amstat.org/2014/09/curveball/|website=CHANCE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, suppose a single pitch has a 3” rise, 0.47’ total break, 21.5 break point, and 8” location change. The calculation of the GI would be the following:

&lt;math&gt;GI = (-2.51)(3)+(1.88)(21.5)-(0.47)(8)+(0.51)(0.47)&lt;/math&gt;

After publication of the Greiner Index, it was updated to include all pitches with a 2D location parameter. By combining GI with speed, QOP was developed. The proprietary [[Linear regression|linear model]] for QOP is not published, and is patent-pending.

The following components affect the overall QOP score in the following way:

Increased rise ---&gt; lower QOP (for curveballs)

Increased total break ---&gt; higher QOP

Increased late vertical break ---&gt; higher QOP

Increased horizontal break ---&gt; higher QOP

Closeness to corners of [[strike zone]] ---&gt; higher QOP

Increased velocity ---&gt; higher QOP

Greiner and Wilson desired to develop a statistic that could be used by pitching coaches and [[Scout (sport)|scouts]] to develop and determine pitcher potential. Furthermore, in 2015 they suggested QOP has the potential for predicting (and therefore preventing) injury, as well as batter quantification.&lt;ref&gt;2015 Saber Conference&lt;/ref&gt;  The QOP statistic is calculated by QOPBASEBALL.&lt;ref&gt;api.qopbaseball.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strike Zone Plus/Minus ==
In February 2015, Joe Rosales and Scott Spratt introduced a system for quantifying pitches that focuses not on the particular qualities of the pitch itself, but on its framing in the strike zone and resulting call made by the [[Catcher|catcher]] as a ball or a strike.  They have named their system, Strike Zone Plus/Minus. This system was developed because they observed that two pitches can be thrown in exactly the same location and one be called a strike, and one called a ball. The strike zone is not always observed with 100 percent accuracy. Therefore, Rosales and Spratt thought that perhaps some pitchers “had more of a knack” for throwing borderline pitches that get called as strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosales/Spratt|first1=Joe/Scott|title=Who Is Responsible For A Called Strike?|url=http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SSAC15-RP-Finalist-Who-is-responsible-for-a-called-strike.pdf|website=MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strike Zone Plus/Minus “divide[s] the credit for whether a pitch is called a ball or strike among the catcher, the pitcher, the batter, and the umpire involved.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosales/Spratt|first1=Joe/Scott|title=Who Is Responsible For A Called Strike?|url=http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SSAC15-RP-Finalist-Who-is-responsible-for-a-called-strike.pdf|website=MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many different pitch framing methodologies publicly available, Rosales and Spratt claim that their system is unique because the pitchers, batters, and umpires are treated as “independent actors,” as opposed to variables by which to adjust the catcher’s performance. Many other methodologies do not consider anything besides the catcher. Each person is treated as independent because the catcher has his own receiving skills, the pitcher has his own ability to locate the pitch, the batter has his unique body language, and the umpire has personal standards. Thus, this method treats each of the four individuals as significant participants and divide the credit for the outcome of each pitch among the four based on individual tendencies. Strike Zone Plus/Minus is also unique because it uses “Baseball Info Solutions data on where the catcher sets his target for the pitch, allowing [them] to incorporate the pitcher's command (how close he comes to hitting the target) into [their] system.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosales/Spratt|first1=Joe/Scott|title=Who Is Responsible For A Called Strike?|url=http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SSAC15-RP-Finalist-Who-is-responsible-for-a-called-strike.pdf|website=MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Strike Zone Plus/Minus is an outcome-oriented measure of pitch quality, and it seeks to refine the process by which that outcome is called (ball or strike). Its scope is limited in the overall quest to seek a pitch quantification statistic because it cannot give any information about a pitch that is not a ball or a strike. Thus, Strike Zone Plus/Minus cannot help quantify any pitch that is actually put into play. Rosales and Spratt see the value of the Strike Zone Plus/Minus system relating to the free agent market values of catchers.

== Swartz &amp; Swartz ==
Phillippa and Tim Swartz sought to introduce a pitch quantification statistic that is batter-independent. They recognized that some good pitches result in home runs and some bad pitches result in outs. Therefore, they developed a statistic to measure pitch quality based on various underlying conditions, rather than run scoring. They chose to base their statistic on the following pitch variables:

C = pitch count

D = pitch descriptor

The pitch descriptor (D) is determined by a number of select covariates: pitch location, speed, type, handedness of the pitcher, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Swartz &amp; Swartz, 2017, The Quality of Pitches in Major League Baseball, The American Statistician, in press.&lt;/ref&gt; To account for the complex relationship between the pitch quality and the covariates, a random forest methodology is used to obtain an estimation of the overall pitch quality. The random forest method where “ “important” covariates are determined by the splits in the tree...is attractive when we do not know in advance which variables (e.g. pitch location, pitch speed, pitch type, handedness) are predictive.”&lt;ref&gt;Swartz &amp; Swartz, 2017, The Quality of Pitches in Major League Baseball, The American Statistician, in press.&lt;/ref&gt;
They have used this statistic to describe the change in pitch quality during a game, and also to evaluate the skills of pitchers, much like ERA.

The '''Liston B. Ramsey Regional Activity Center''' is a 7,826-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Cullowhee, North Carolina|Cullowhee]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]], and is home to the [[Western Carolina University]] [[Western Carolina Catamounts|Catamounts]] [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] teams. It is also named "THE LAIR". It is a state owned facility (by the University) and offers the largest [[seating capacity]] inside the [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]–[[Atlanta]]–[[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] triangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Entertainment|url=http://ramsey.wcu.edu/entertainment.htm|publisher=Western Carolina University|accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the arena, the Ramsey Center includes five racquetball courts, two basketball courts, a walking/jogging track, and lighted outdoor rollerblade/skateboard facilities for students.

Features not in use at this time include an indoor firing range and an outdoor-lighted [[ice skating]] facility.

==History==
The Liston B. Ramsey Regional Activity Center was completed in April, 1986 and was dedicated on December 6 of that same year before a standing-room only crowd of 8,114 as Western Carolina hosted North Carolina State on the men's basketball hardwood. The first official game in the new building took place two-days prior as the women's squad downed Mars Hill on December 4, 1986, by a score of 65-61. In 1999, the Ramsey Center also became the home venue for the WCU volleyball team.&lt;ref name="lbrrac"&gt;{{cite web |title=Liston B.

'''The Showgrounds''' is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Newry]], [[County Down]], Northern Ireland. It was the home ground of [[Newry City F.C.]] and is now the home ground of their successor club, [[Newry City A.F.C.]]. The stadium holds 7,949, but is currently restricted to 2,275 under safety legislation.&lt;ref name="niassembly1"/&gt;

The stadium is located in the Greenbank Industrial Estate on the [[Warrenpoint]] Road, close to the [[Down GAA]] stadium [[Páirc Esler]].

== History ==
In 2009, The Showgrounds had two new stands constructed.&lt;ref name=stand&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-20014360.html |title=Newry reveal forward thinking at Showgrounds |publisher=Belfast Telegraph (archived at Highbeam) |date= |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, there were plans to turn The Showgrounds' pitch into an [[artificial turf]] pitch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/local/cashstrapped-newry-embrace-amateur-future-28694900.html |title=Cash-strapped Newry embrace amateur future |publisher=Belfast Telegraph |date=22 December 2011 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however due to Newry City's financial troubles, these plans were shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newrydemocrat.com/articles/sports/31009/newry-city-reboot-denied-league-of-ireland-access/ |title=Newry City reboot denied League of Ireland access |publisher=Newry Democrat |date= |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, on the eighteenth day of the [[2012 Summer Olympics torch relay]], the Olympic torch passed The Showgrounds on its way to [[Páirc Esler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/torchrelay/day18 |title=Olympic Torch Relay – Londonderry to Newry |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Newry City were liquidated after a [[Courts of Northern Ireland#Court of Judicature|High Court]] winding-up petition. Discussions on creating a [[Phoenix club (association football)|phoenix club]], initially titled "Newry City 2012" and eventually titled "Newry City AFC",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21759390 |title=Newry City AFC launch heralds new era |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; took place at The Showgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20595254 |title=Newry City poised to make comeback after being wound-up |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 December 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Newry City was wound up, The Showgrounds were not sold off with the club as it was owned by Newry City's supporters and not the club.&lt;ref name=vid&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20244023 |title=What does future hold for football in Newry? |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 November 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that Newry City AFC would be able to use it as their home ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u.tv/Sport/Newry-launches-new-football-club/55c5e5cf-2400-445f-8f11-7601c6ae0953 |title=Newry launches new football club |publisher=UTV |date= |accessdate=4 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311154639/http://www.u.tv/Sport/Newry-launches-new-football-club/55c5e5cf-2400-445f-8f11-7601c6ae0953 |archivedate=11 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
It was used to host Newry City's matches and also hosts the fixtures of Newry City AFC after Newry City was liquidated. It is also used for training.&lt;ref name=vid /&gt; In 2013, The Showgrounds were suggested as a temporary home ground for [[Warrenpoint Town F.C.|Warrenpoint Town]] after they were promoted to the [[NIFL Premiership]] as their Milltown Playing Field did not fulfill the criteria for use in the NIFL Premiership. However, the [[Irish Football Association]] blocked the move as the owners of The Showgrounds objected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/local/the-park/warrenpoint-towns-rise-to-premiership-football-is-almost-too-good-to-be-true-29261845.html |title=Warrenpoint Town's rise to Premiership football is almost too good to be true |publisher=Belfast Telegraph |date=13 May 2013 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newry City AFC also gave reasons for objecting the potential groundshare, citing the poor quality of the playing surface, the lack of a licence for The Showgrounds to host NIFL Premiership matches and a large increase in insurance and running costs for Newry City if the groundshare went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Category: Uncategorised |url=http://www.newry.ie/2-uncategorised/1662-newry-city-clarify-position-on-ground-sharing |title=Newry City clarify position on ground sharing |publisher=Newry.ie |date= |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Showgrounds are also used to host the [[Bessbrook]] Cup Final, which is traditionally played on [[St. Stephen's Day]]. In 2013, the Bessbrook Cup final was postponed after one of The Showgrounds' floodlight pylons had been damaged in bad weather, which led to Health and Safety officials deeming that The Showgrounds were unsafe to be used for the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newrydemocrat.com/articles/sports/37672/boxing-day-cup-final-postponed/ |title=Boxing Day Cup Final Postponed |publisher=Newry Democrat |date=24 December 2013 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International football ==
The Showgrounds have been used to host youth international fixtures. In 2005, it was a venue in the [[2005 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/4254839.stm |title=Catney called up for U19 tourney |publisher=BBC News |date=10 February 2005 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was used to host some of the [[2009 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification]] matches for Group 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/under19/fixturesresults/round=15216/match=302205/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708102905/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/under19/fixturesresults/round=15216/match=302205/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=UEFA European U-19 C'ship – Fixtures &amp; Results |publisher=UEFA |date=13 October 2008 |accessdate=4 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest recorded incidence of '''women's surfing''' concerns the mythical Kelea. [[Keleanohoanaapiapi|Kelea]] was born of [[Kingdom of Hawaii|royalty]] in [[Maui]], it is believed she out-surfed riders of both genders. A few centuries years pass until the mid-late 1800s, when Thrum’s Hawaiian Annual reported that women in ancient Hawaii surfed in equal numbers and frequently better than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Why Are Surf Magazines Erasing Women?|website=Theestablishment.co|date=|url= http://www.theestablishment.co/2015/11/09/why-are-surf-magazines-erasing-women/|accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Andrea Moller makes history for women's big wave surfing|publisher= [[Surfer]]|date=|url= http://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/12618-andrea-moller-makes-history-for-womens-big-wave-surfing|accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Inside the Curl: Surfing's Surprising History|publisher= [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=|url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130803-surfing-surprising-history-hawaiian-culture-extreme-sports/|accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Coco Ho On The State Of Women’s Surfing|publisher= [[Surfing]]|date=|url= http://www.surfingmagazine.com/photos/coco-ho-state-womens-surfing/#8yUJXmlgaXR8AeH3.99|accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-DWQSYRx4MUC&amp;pg=PR21&amp;lpg=PR21&amp;dq=history+of+women's+surfing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UciV5AVwHX&amp;sig=wFjDHSNkMjKLs2iA0e-frUiDo1g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS58ikydTLAhXDthoKHebNAck4FBDoAQhJMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20women's%20surfing&amp;f=false |title=The Encyclopedia of Surfing - Matt Warshaw - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women's surfing in Australia]] has a popular following amongst female participants.

Women’s surfing has made an increase in popularity over the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Harriet Agerholm |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladeshi-surfer-girls-who-refuse-accept-sexism-women-rights-work-marry-a7227476.html |title=Girls in Bangladesh are expected to work or marry. These girls surf instead |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=2016-09-06 |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The origin of surfing was most likely started in New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahrens |first=Chris |url=http://www.thecoastnews.com/2011/03/03/a-short-history-of-womens-surfing/ |title=A short history of women’s surfing – The Coast News Group |website=Thecoastnews.com |date=2016-10-10 |accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a sport full of culture, fun, and adventure. Surfing was used to explore the oceans and to have fun becoming a part of nature. It spread from New Guinea to Hawaii. It is mostly known to be practiced in Hawaii and the surrounding islands, but it has spread to the rest of the continents. It was not widely accepted by Europeans because it took time away from working and labor, although they enjoyed the excitement of seeing the action of surfing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Isaiah Walker |url=http://www.theinertia.com/surf/women-movement-ancient-hawaiian-surf-lore/ |title=Womentum: The Women's Movement (in Context) |publisher=The Inertia |date=2011-07-05 |accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turning points==
The California Golden Girls played a huge part in the making Women’s surfing featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwomensurfing.com/the-california-golden-girls/ |title=History of Women's Surfing : The California Golden Girls |website=Historyofwomensurfing.com |accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were pivotal in the 1970 to the 1980 to making people aware of the sport and they gave a face to the once widely known “Men’s Sport.”

==Regions==
In the United States, the most common places you will find women’s surfing would be California and Hawaii because they have the best conditions for surfing. Although you are able to surf in any place that has waves, surfing is mostly found all across the world from Peru, Australia, Indonesia, South Africa, France, Philippines, Ecuador, and anywhere else that has a shore and waves coming in. Although surfing can be found anywhere, there are a lot of things that affect the waves. Tide, time of day, storms miles off shore, and weather can all affect the strength of the waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinspireinitiative.org/tag/history-of-womens-surfing-2/ |title=history of women's surfing Archives - The Inspire Initiative™ |website=Theinspireinitiative.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women surfers and quotations==
[[Bethany Hamilton]]: She is an American surfer that despite getting attacked by a shark while surfing, and having her arm bitten off, she did not let that stop her from continuing her career as a surfer. She continued to get better and won many competitions following her attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/8769-the-inspirational-quotes-by-bethany-hamilton |title=The inspirational quotes by Bethany Hamilton |website=Surfertoday.com |date=2003-10-31 |accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''“It's hard for me to describe the joy I felt after I stood up and rode wave in for the first time after the attack. I was incredibly thankful and happy inside. The tiny bit of doubt that would sometimes tell me you'll never surf again was gone in one wave.” –Bethany Hamilton''

Marge Calhoun: She was a woman surfer who pioneered surfing in Hawaii. She is considered the first women surfing champion. She was indicted into the surfing hall of fame in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopediaofsurfing.com/entries/calhoun-family |title=Entries – Calhoun Family – Encyclopedia Of Surfing |website=Encyclopediaofsurfing.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephanie Gilmore]]: “Fear - It's a fine line between that and pushing yourself. You definitely reach new heights when you push. But fear is good. Fear keeps us alive. If we didn't have it, we'd be doing crazy things and getting in sticky situations.” –Stephanie Gilmore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azquotes.com/author/30677-Stephanie_Gilmore |title=TOP 11 QUOTES BY STEPHANIE GILMORE |publisher=A-Z Quotes |date=1988-01-29 |accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carissa Moore]]: “We all strive to find something unique and special that we are passionate about that separates us from the rest.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carissamoore.com/ |title=Carissa Moore |publisher=Carissa Moore |date=2016-04-30 |accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maya Gabeira]] is a big wave surfer who was born in Rio de Janeiro. She has five Billabong XXL Global Big Wave Award titles received from 2007–2010 and in 2012. She also won the 2009 ESPY Award for Best Female Action Sport Athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Binns |first=Chris |url=http://www.redbull.com/us/en/surfing/athletes/1331575111951/maya-gabeira |title=Maya Gabeira: Surfing – Official Athlete Page |website=Redbull.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Courtney Conlogue]] is a 25 year old American professional surfer. In an interview with ESPN she outlined what it takes to be a professional surfer. "I think some people perceive surfing as just a lifestyle sport. This will be my sixth year competing professionally on the World Tour, and to be involved in something like this goes to show that we do fine-tune our bodies in order to be as strong as we can when we enter the water. During the offseason, I train three to five days a week, and then I train every day in the water. Depending on the way the swell is -- because our sport is based on Mother Nature -- when the waves are good, I surf probably six hours a day."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/sports/article/16426114/surfer-courtney-conlogue-talks-body-love-breathing-underwater-espn-body-issue|title=Surfer Courtney Conlogue shares what it takes to be a pro surfer|last=Ain|first=Morty|date=26 June 2016|website=www.espn.com|publisher=ESPN|access-date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Workers Stadium - satellite image (1967-09-20).jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Workers' Stadium.  (1967-09-20)]]
The '''Workers' Stadium''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|工|人|体|育|场}}|t={{linktext|工|人|體|育|場}}|p=Gōngrén Tǐyùcháng}}), often called '''Gongti''' or '''Gong Ti''', is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in the [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]] of north-eastern [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]]. It is mostly used for [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics|football (soccer)]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/venues/wst/index.shtml|title=Beijing2008.cn profile.|author=|date=|website=beijing2008.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was built in 1959 and was last renovated in 2004 (the concrete structure was strengthened, a new rotating display screen and energy-saving devices were installed). It has a capacity of 66,161 and covers a land area of 350,000 square meters. It is one of the [[Ten Great Buildings]] constructed in 1959 for the 10th anniversary of the [[People's Republic of China]]. During the 1950s and 1960s mass executions were carried out in the stadium {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

==History==
The stadium was the main venue for the [[1990 Asian Games]], where the opening and closing ceremonies were held. Some high attendance matches of the [[Beijing Guo'an]] football club are held at the stadium. In 1993 the stadium was host to a slew of [[World Records]] set by the world-leading group of Chinese distance runners at the 7th Edition of the Chinese National Games, the most famous being international stars and world champions [[Wang Junxia]] and [[Qu Yunxia]], who had dominated the 1993 World Championships a month before.

The stadium holds claim to the fastest women's [[1500 m]] time ever recorded of 3:50.46, the fastest women's [[3000 m]] of 8:06.11 and the fastest women's [[10,000 m]] of 29:31.78. These world records still stand today and are arguably the stadium's biggest claim to fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.sohu.com/20090719/n265320285.shtml|title=视频：新中国日记 传奇马家军的成名之战-搜狐视频|author=|date=|website=tv.sohu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, the stadium was partially demolished and renovated as part of China's bid for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympic Games]], which ultimately failed. The stadium continued to be a mainstay of Beijing sports into the 21st century, being the [[2004 AFC Asian Cup Final|Grand Final]] venue of [[2004 AFC Asian Cup]].

For the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], it hosted the football quarter-finals and semi-finals, and the women's gold medal final. The stadium was scheduled to host the first ever [[National Football League|NFL]] game played in China, a preseason game between the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[New England Patriots]] on August 8, 2007. However, the [[China Bowl (NFL)|China Bowl]] was canceled in April 2007. The reasons given were that the NFL wanted to devote all its resources to the scheduled regular season game between the [[Miami Dolphins]] and the [[New York Giants]], to be played in [[London]] on October 28, 2007.

The stadium was the host for the 2009 [[Barclays Asia Trophy]] on 29 July and 31 July 2009, featuring [[Beijing Guoan]], and [[Premier League]] clubs [[Tottenham Hotspur]], [[West Ham United]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. It also hosted [[FC Bayern Munich]]'s pre-season China Tour of 2012, during which the [[Bundesliga]] club had a friendly match with [[Beijing Guoan]]. The areas north ([[Sanlitun]]), east, and west of the stadium are popular nightlife destinations. The ''xi men'' (West Gate) offers a strip of nightclubs. The [[Workers Indoor Arena]] is located to the west of the stadium. The stadium has been used for concerts as well. Global superstar [[Mariah Carey]] began her sold-out five-show tour at the Workers Stadium, and Linkin Park played [[The Hunting Party Tour]] at July 26, 2015 in front of an audience of 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.yibada.com/articles/49016/20150728/linkin-park-rocks-beijing-workers-stadium.htm|title=Linkin Park Rocks Beijing Workers' Stadium|first=Francis Eduard|last=Ang|date=28 July 2015|website=yibada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
