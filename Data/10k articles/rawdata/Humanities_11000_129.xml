      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21799">'''Affiliative conflict theory''' ('''ACT''') is a social psychological approach that encompasses [[interpersonal communication]] and has a background in [[nonverbal communication]].  This [[theory]] postulates that "people have competing needs or desires for intimacy and autonomy" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;30). In any relationship, people will negotiate and try to balance out their own behavioral acts of (approach and avoidance) to maintain a comfortable level of [[intimacy]].&lt;ref name=Burgoon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J.K.|title=Interpersonal Adaption: Dyadic Interaction Patterns.|journal=New York: Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Affiliative conflict theory (ACT), also referred to as equilibrium theory or model,&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt; was first introduced in the 1960s by [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]]. His article "Eye Contact, Distance and Affiliation", co-authored with [[Janet Dean Fodor|Janet Dean]] was published in ''Sociometry'' in 1965, and has been used greatly as the base line for ACT. Michael Argyle had a long distinguished career in which he advanced the field of [[social psychology]]. His work on [[nonverbal communication]] greatly developed this [[theory]] and his book ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Behavior'' became an international bestseller in 1967. Argyle's curiosity regarding if [[social skills]] were learned in the same way as manual skills led him to research interpersonal behavior.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Throughout his life's work he had various associates (Argyle &amp; Dean, 1965; Argyle &amp; Lalljee &amp; Cook, 1968, Argyle &amp; Ingham, 1972; Argyle &amp; Ingham, Alkema &amp; McCallin, 1972); all of which worked to validate the [[theory]] through their focus on the relationship between visual behavior (nonverbal behavior) and interpersonal distance (Coutts, pg. 3). Visual behavior research studies deal with influence, and with attributions made by observers. This reflects psychological [[research]] on nonverbal cues.&lt;ref name=Coutts&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coutts|first=L. M.|title=Affiliative Conflict Theory: Exploration of the Notions of Intimacy Equilibrium and Behavioral Compensation|journal=Windsor: University of Windsor.|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concept of nonverbal behavior==

There are numerous behaviors that fall under nonverbal involvement.  The nonverbal includes [[distance]], [[gaze]], [[touch]], body orientation, body lean, facial expressiveness, talking duration, interruptions, postural openness, relational gestures, head nods, and paralinguistic cues such as [[rate (mathematics)|rate]] and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], which are at least as important as the words spoken in communicating to others.&lt;ref name=Meh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mehrabian|first=A.|title=Orientation behaviors and nonverbal attitude communication.|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1967|pages=324–332|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1967.tb01190.x|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the basic study of nonverbal communications that was tested is the study of temporal patterning which is defined  as relation to events in the vocal-verbal channel, when the receiver looks for cues, responds to them, and interprets them, and other times when the same movement or configuration will be unnoticed or disregarded.&lt;ref name=Mortensen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mortensen|first=D.|title=Communication Theory|journal=New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also beliefs that some nonverbal involvement cues have been found to increase personal performance on tasks such as test, verbal encoding, and relationship building.

Along with nonverbal behavior, another basic concept to understand is immediacy. [[Immediacy (philosophy)|Immediacy]] is generally defined as the degree of directness and intensity of interaction between two entities, such as two people.&lt;ref name=Remland&gt;{{cite journal|last=Remland|first=M.|author2=Jones, T.|title=The effects of nonverbal involvement and communication apprehension on state anxiety, interpersonal attraction, and speech duration.|journal=Communication Quarterly|year=1989|volume=37|issue=3|pages=170–183|doi=10.1080/01463378909385538}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Immediacy of body orientation is defined as the percentage of the duration of communicator-addressee interaction during which the communicator's median plane" (i.e., the plane perpendicular to the communicator's chest) passes through the addressee's position.&lt;ref name=Remland /&gt; When discussing immediacy, you tend to look at the head orientation of a communicator towards his addressee or it may be defined as the percentage of the duration of communicator-addressee interaction during which the communicator's head is directed towards the addressee's position. Duration of interaction between two individuals is defined as the length of time during which the two individuals are in each other's presence.

==Argyle and Cook's modifications==

In 1976, Argyle and Cook modified and extended their original theory after concluding only partial support for compensation.

:o In their first modification they added:

::-  Form of address – emotional expression
::- Absence of physical barriers
::- Openness of posture
::- Friendliness&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt;

:o The second modification addressed:

::- Effects of social norms (environment) on how people interact or obtain equilibrium levels.
::-  For example, "a couple may have a mutually strong approach need, but may "constrain" their intimacy behaviors to a socially acceptable lever if they are in public."&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt;

:o The third modification addressed:

::- Acknowledges that reciprocity may occur in response to intimacy changes. (burgoon 32)

==Empirical support==

Many academic scholars have researched ACT. Joseph Cappella, Ira Firestone, and John Aiello are just a few scholars whose conclusions of ACT differed. The first scholar, Joseph Cappella, did thirty-six studies in his review that concluded that "increased proximity leads to compensatory responses on distancing, gaze, posture, body orientation, bodily activity, verbal output, and the like" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;33). His results also theorize that physical closeness create a discomfort in partners that then respond by "increasing physical distance or psychological distance" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;33) The second scholar, Ira Firestone is known for his research on Reconciling verbal and nonverbal models of dyadic communications.&lt;ref name=Firestone&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|last=Firestone|first=I.|journal=Reconciling Verbal and Nonverbal Models of Dyadic Commission|year=1977|volume=2|issue=1|pages=30–44|doi=10.1007/bf01127016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firestone's conclusion was opposite to Cappella's. He concluded in one of his reviews that responses to spatial adjustments had various results. "Spatial distance, posture, and visual behavior features of dyadic interaction appear to show complex interdependencies. Both facilitative and inhibitory relationships abound. Clearly, the conclusion that non-verbal approach by one party induces withdrawal by the other is unwanted" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;33). The third scholar, John Aiello came to a more tempered conclusion. His studies reflected that compensation is more common in stable relationships rather than developing ones. He also stated that "comfort-oriented models do not predict observable compensation as long as variations immediacy behaviors fall with in optimal distance range" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;33). The different conclusions between these three scholars can only give a partial and inconsistent support of ACT, with proximity being the most consistent elicitor of compensation.

==Recent modifications==
Further research has added the concepts of [[cognition]] and [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s however its "reliance on the basic assumptions and elements of Act affirms its influential impact and some of the "truths" it has uncovered" (Burgoon, pg. 38). According to Judy Burgoon the, "most significant contributions have been the introduction of arousal or discomfort as a primary indicator of behavioral changes, and attention to compensation as one major interaction pattern in [[interpersonal communication]]" (Burgoon, pg. 37).

The concept of compensation was first introduced and added to the theory by Larry Coutts and Frank Schneider in 1976 in their ACT article that investigated the intimacy equilibrium and compensation hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Coutts2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coutts|first=L. M.|author2=Schneider|title=Affiliative Conflict Theory: An Investigation of the Intimacy Equilibrium and Compensation Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1976|pages=1135–1142|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.34.6.1135|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent modifications of ACT, as seen in John Aiello and Donna Thompson's comfort model which came about in 1979,&lt;ref name=Ailloe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ailloe|first=J.|author2=Thompson, D.|title=Interpersonal Distance Preferences|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|year=1979|volume=4|issue=2|pages=113–118|doi=10.1007/bf01006355}}&lt;/ref&gt; was at odds with ACT's basic premise; due to the conclusion that discomfort is not the trigger for compensation. Because "discomfort is only activated when interaction behaviors become extreme" (Burgoon, pg. 36). Another modification was done by Knowles (1980, 1989) whom introduced the rubric of field theory. One important contribution is that "behavior is goal oriented and purposeful, not necessarily mindful (Burgoon, pg. 36) The environments impact on human behavior also added another addition to ACT, known as field theory. Field Theory shows, that approach and avoidance gradients draw people together and apart. Approach is the need and desires whereas avoidance comes from enduring features like the fear of rejection. In 1989, Knowles "reconceptualization of ACT is that people feel discomfort when their internal approach and avoidance gradients are not equal" (Burgoon, pg. 36). "Knowles also allows for constant redefinition of gradieSnts and thus a fluctuating equilibrium level" (Burgoon, pg. 37). The problems it creates for ACT is such that, if gradients fluctuate "from moment to moment" then accurate predictions appears limited" (Burgoon, pg. 37). An interesting notion to take from these modifications is that "even when we want to be intimate with another, the fear of being too intimate or being rejected (avoidance gradient) may lurk in the background as an influential factor determining behavior" (Burgoon, pg. 37).

==Equilibrium==
The affiliative conflict theory becomes complex when one considers that approach and avoidance preferences are not the same, for example; when two people have "differing preferred levels of intimacy" (Burgoon, pg. 31). When two interactants have differing preferred levels of intimacy, they must (consciously or unconsciously) negotiate their differences to arrive at an equilibrium or [[homeostasis]] level that is mutually acceptable. This level of [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] is known as the intimacy equilibrium point. Equilibrium is reached when individuals or dyads can maintain sufficient [[distance]] and immediacy, such that they are close enough to meet affiliative needs, while allowing each other [[privacy]] and [[autonomy]]. ACT modification to discuss the process of compensation, is utilized to restore equilibrium. [[Anxiety]] is an example of an intimate behavior that can come from a disturbed or unbalanced equilibrium level.&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt; Thus, equilibrium can only be established when the two people/dyads are able to negotiate and maintain a comfortable level of intimacy through their nonverbal interactions.

"Because the intimacy equilibrium is said to be a product of several interrelated behaviors, it is not clear as to the influence of such variables on the overall equilibrium level. That is, while a particular factor may affect interpersonal immediacy along one behavioral dimension (e.g., eye contact) this effect may be offset by a compensatory shift in immediacy along some other (unmeasured) behavioral dimension (e.g. body orientation or interpersonal distance). As a consequence, a change may occur in one behavioral dimension, although there would be little relative change in the equilibrium as a whole" (Coutts, pg. 5.)&lt;ref name=Coutts /&gt;

Affiliative Conflict Theory thus proposes that there are two separate, but related; propositions that involve maintaining the balance of the intimacy equilibrium point. The first is the "establishment of an equilibrium or balance of approach and avoidance forces reflected in the intensity of immediacy behaviors emitted by the interactants" (Coutts, pg. 3). The second deals with "compensatory changes in one or more of the immediacy behaviors following disruptions in the established equilibrium" (Coutts, pg. 3). These propositions can also be explained as balanced and unbalanced.&lt;ref name=Coutts /&gt;

===Balanced===
A balanced equilibrium is created when there is an increase in affiliative behavior, notably a decrease in avoidance. All nonverbal behaviors contribute to maintaining balance but researchers focus mostly on three nonverbal behaviors of intimacy and their relationship, which include eye contact, physical proximity and need for affiliation.&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt;

[[File:The Gaze.jpg|thumbnail|right|Increased eye contact and physical proximity during social interaction warrants an increase in intimacy.]]

::• '''''[[Eye-contact]]''''': Eye-contact can have a variety of subjective meanings such as friendship, sexual attraction, hate and struggle for dominance.&lt;ref name=Argle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arygle|first=M.|author2=Dean, J.|title=Eye-Contact, Distance and Affiliation|journal=Sociometry|year=1965|volume=28|issue=3|pages=289–304|doi=10.2307/2786027}}&lt;/ref&gt; During social interaction, people look each other in the eye, repeatedly but short periods. If we may anticipate, people look most while they are listening, and use glances of about 3-10 seconds in length. When applied to the affiliative conflict theory, the approach forces include the need for feedback and affiliative needs. Argyle suggests that increased eye contact during interaction warrants an increase in intimacy. Eye contact is a reinforcer in the operative conditioning of verbal behavior such as looking your partner in the eye when you say I love you or during wedding vows.&lt;ref name=Argle /&gt;

::• '''''Physical Proximity''''' – The interpersonal distance between individuals can also affect the intimacy equilibrium level. During social interaction, one's intimacy should increase when individuals are close in space.&lt;ref name=Russo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russo|first=N.|title=Eye Contact, Interpersonal Distance, and the Equilibrium Theory.|journal=American Psychological Association|year=1975|volume=31|issue=3|pages=497–502|doi=10.1037/h0076476}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hug or kiss are good examples of nonverbal behaviors that increase intimacy between two interactants. It's important to note that in order to maintain a certain level of intimacy a change in one's behavior, such as interpersonal distance, must be compensated for by a change in another, such as eye contact.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=B.|author2=Goldberg, G.|author3= Keisler, C.|title=) Visual behavior and face-to-face distance during interaction|journal=Sociometry|year=1969|volume=32|issue=1|pages=43–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
::• '''''[[Need for affiliation]]''''' – The need for affiliation in a balanced equilibrium concerns the desire to be associated with specific people and groups, to have a greater sense of belonging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Connor | first1 = S. | last2 = Rosenblood | first2 = L. | year = 1996 | title = Affiliation motivation in everyday experience: A theoretical comparison | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 3| pages = 513–522 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.513}}&lt;/ref&gt; It plays an important role in human interactions and the formation of bonds and relationships. As a principle of this theory, the need for affiliation is determines the motivation for both verbal and nonverbal behaviors between two individuals. A person with a moderate need of affiliation towards another person tends to want to be intimate with that individual. One of the best examples is a wedding proposal. A man's desire to have a more intimate relationship with a woman is put on display and warrants a verbal response which also validates the woman's need for affiliation if she accepts his proposal.&lt;ref name=Russo /&gt; 
 
It is supposed that similar considerations apply to other types of behavior, which are linked with affiliative motivation. Thus, there have been many studies surrounding the equilibrium point of intimacy of conversation and of amount of smiling. The more these behaviors occur, the more affiliative motivation is satisfied, but if they go too far or are decreased, anxiety is created and an avoidance behavior is shown.&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt;

===Unbalanced===

An unbalance is created when there is a decrease in affiliative behavior, notably increased avoidance, changes in one or more of the immediacy behaviors following disruptions in the established equilibrium.  If equilibrium for intimacy is disturbed along one of its dimensions, attempts will first be made to restore it by adjusting the others. If this is not possible because all are held constant, or because the deviation is too extreme, the subject will feel uncomfortable.  If the disturbance is in the direction of less intimacy, he/she will simply feel deprived of affiliative satisfactions. Another source of unbalance is [[communication apprehension]] (CA).&lt;ref name=Meh /&gt; CA constitute a mediating variable and is characterizes as apprehension as an internal feeling of considerable discomfort which leads to communication avoidance. Thus, persons who report high levels of CA experience more anxiety during an interaction than persons who report low levels of CA. Examples of a typical unbalance in response to the close approach of another is to compensate with gaze aversion, indirect body orientation, backing away from a touch, and increased distance.  A person can use avoidance behavior that express a desire to resist what is considered an inappropriate increase in the level of intimacy for that particular interaction.

==Gender roles==

Research shows that gender plays an important role in ACT. As Argyle (1967) points out, females are socialized to have a higher [[affiliative]] orientation, which they may express through using more eye contact.  However, other explanations can account for the higher use of mutual gaze by females.&lt;ref name=Argyle3&gt;{{cite book|last=Argyle|first=M.|title=The psychology of interpersonal behavior,|year=1967|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt; A higher affiliative orientation may increase the female's sensitivity and/or responsivity to social cues. Since the eyes are the prime source of information about another's attention, females that socializes in our culture would be expected to look more at the other person's eyes for this social information, thus increasing the amount of time a female dyad engages in eye contact, and perhaps (but not necessarily) increasing the mean length of mutual gaze for the dyad. The data show that the looking time in general shows an increase in the significance of the sex effect with age. Females may rely more on external cues in general, and insofar as the eyes of another are salient cues, the percentage of time in monitoring them should increase.&lt;ref name=Russo /&gt;  
  
Interpersonal distance was examined after a study about eye contact and mean length of mutual glance by Argyle and Ingham (1972) showed conflicting and reversal effects between males and females.&lt;ref name=Argyle4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Argyle|first=M.|author2=Ingham, R.|title=Gaze, mutual gaze, and proximity|journal=Semiotica|pages=32–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Russo conducted a study that focused on the eye-contact and distance relationship. In this study, 24 males and 24 females were drawn in same-sex pairs from kindergarten, third, and sixth grades and asked to "try out some distances and tell (the researcher) how they like them" (p.&amp;nbsp;499). Each participant sat and conversed for 2 minutes at each of the three distances. At each 2 minute interval the researcher asked the subjects how they liked talking at that particular distance. Russo found that the percentage of time engaged in contact (a) increased with distance, (b) was higher for females than males; and (c) did not significantly differ with friendship. In terms of the mean length of eye contact it: (a) did not significantly increase with interpersonal distance; (b) was higher for females than for males; and (c) was significantly greater for friends than nonfriends. Thus, the mean length of eye-contact appears to index affiliative tendencies, while the total amount of eye-contact does not.&lt;ref name=Russo /&gt;

She was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Solo]] [[57th Annual Grammy Awards|in 2015]] for her album of French songs, ''Douce France''. She is a regular recital and recording partner with Swedish pianist [[Bengt Forsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/09/arts/music-review-von-otter-from-lieder-to-blues.html | title=Music Review: Von Otter, From Lieder to Blues | work=The New York Times | author=Anthony Tommasini | date=1998-05-09 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/19/arts/music/vibrant-singing-at-the-nice-price.html | title=Vibrant Singing at the Nice Price |work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Anthony Tommasini]]| date=2005-04-19 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/arts/music/05otte.html | title=Resilience of the Human Spirit, in Song | work=The New York Times | author=Steve Smith | date=2009-05-04 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, von Otter sang the Evangelist in the premiere of [[Sven-David Sandström]]'s ''[[Ordet – en passion]]''. Other work in contemporary music has included singing the role of The Woman in ''Senza Sangue'' of [[Péter Eötvös]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/arts/music/review-a-peter-eotvos-premiere-and-schubert-at-the-new-york-philharmonic.html|title=Review: A Peter Eotvos Premiere and Schubert at the New York Philharmonic|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Anthony Tommasini]]|date=2015-05-10| accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other media, she appeared in the film ''[[A Late Quartet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/movies/a-late-quartet-directed-by-yaron-zilberman.html | title=The Strings Play On; The Bonds Tear Apart | work=The New York Times | author=Stephen Holden | date=2012-11-01 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, she released an album of music written by composers imprisoned in the Nazi "model" ghetto of [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] (also known as Terezin) prior to their transportation to the death camp of Auschwitz. She collaborated on this project with [[Christian Gerhaher]] (baritone) and chamber musicians. She has stated that the material has special personal meaning for her as her father had attempted unsuccessfully during the war to spread information that he had received from SS officer [[Kurt Gerstein]] about the Nazi death camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://forward.com/culture/11634/a-different-aria-00490/ | title=A Different Aria | work=Forward | author=David Bartal | date=2007-09-17 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16334">The '''archaeology of trade and exchange''' is a sub-discipline of [[archaeology]] that identifies how material goods and ideas moved across human populations. The terms “trade” and “exchange” have slightly different connotations: trade focuses on the long-distance circulation of material goods; exchange considers the transfer of persons and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirth|first1=Kenneth G.|last2=Pillsbury|first2=Joanne|title= Merchants, Markets, and Exchange in the Pre-Columbian World|url={{google books|plainurl=y |id=hEyBMAEACAAJ}} |year=2013|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection|isbn=978-0-88402-386-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One part of archaeology considers [[pre-modern]] societies. [[market (place)|Market]]s, [[currency]], [[craft production]], [[ownership]] and concepts such as buying and selling had different meanings in those societies. Earlier economies were strongly defined by religious, ethnic and geographic constraints. Exchange could be used to strengthen social bonds instead of creating wealth. The archaeology of trade therefore includes the transfer of ideas and social practices in addition to the exchange of physical goods.

The archaeology of trade and exchange considers how trade influenced social development and power structures.

==Influences on ancient trade and exchange==
The theory and practice of the archaeology of trade and exchange have been influenced by several important schools of thought.

==Political economy==
The field of [[political economy]] deals with the interplay between political institutions and economic activity.&lt;ref name="Samuelson1983"&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul Anthony |last=Samuelson|title=Foundations of Economic Analysis|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=BWxJnwEACAAJ}}|date=January 1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-31303-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interdisciplinary field has contributions from [[economics]], [[political science]] and [[sociology]]. Archaeologists who study political economy focus on how political structure, leadership and administration affect economic activity and how the economy can affect the strength and organization of political institutions.&lt;ref name="Earle1997"&gt;{{cite book|first=Timothy K. |last=Earle|title=How Chiefs Come to Power: The Political Economy in Prehistory|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4AjAk15WSbQC}}|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2856-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic anthropology==
[[Economic anthropology]] is the study of the social context of economic transactions to explore the varied connections between [[culture]] and economy. Fields of research in economic anthropology include exchange, gift-giving and forms of [[currency]]. The study of [[economic anthropology]] also includes non-capitalist societies.

Important contributors to the field are listed below.

===Karl Marx===
[[Philosopher]] and [[economist]] [[Karl Marx]] influenced the fields of political economy and economic anthropology. His ideas on labor, modes and [[means of production]] and [[social class]] related to the frameworks used to understand the creation and exercise of power. Anthropologists used Marx’s ideas to provide perspective on archaeological and anthropological data. Marx’s theories on how the production and consumption of goods relate to social and political power were useful to those studying the evolution of trade and exchange in ancient societies.&lt;ref name="Diamond1979"&gt;{{cite book|first=Stanley |last=Diamond|title=Toward a Marxist Anthropology: Problems and Perspectives|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=uIQhnjuSjAcC}}|date=1 January 1979|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-080771-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karl Polanyi===
[[Karl Polanyi]], a 20th-century economic theorist, introduced the idea of [[substantivism]]. Substantivism argues that economies operate within distinct cultural contexts, rather than operating separately from culture. Polanyi introduced concepts to economic anthropology that remain important to describe the movements of goods and their link to power: [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]] and exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Polanyi|first1=Karl|chapter=The Economy as Instituted Process|editor-first1=Mark S. |editor-last1=Granovetter|editor-first2=Richard |editor-last2=Swedberg|title=The Sociology of Economic Life|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=sZP8XwAACAAJ}}|date=21 April 2011|publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com, Limited|isbn=978-1-4596-1721-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcel Mauss and Bronislaw Malinowski===
[[Bronislaw Malinowski]] and [[Marcel Mauss]] contributed to economic anthropology on gift-giving. They independently studied its economics and the social and political importance, especially in non-capitalist cultures. Their work is important in the study of ancient trade and exchange as a reminder of the significance and complexity of the movement of goods in non-capitalist societies.

===George Dalton===
Anthropologist George Dalton contributed to the early study of trade and exchange in non-capitalistic systems through his work on “primitive economies.”&lt;ref name="Dalton1961"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalton|first1=George|title=Economic Theory and Primitive Society|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=kQYFcAAACAAJ}}|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalton took part in a debate begun by Polanyi regarding “formal” versus “substantive” meanings of economy. The “formal” economy involves the mechanisms of trade and exchange based on rational decision-making, whereas the “substantive” economy is the process by which individuals subsist.

==Approaches for studying the archaeology of trade==
Approaches taken to the study of the archaeology of trade and exchange can be organized in three groups: the scalar approach (focusing on a particular level of interaction); the examination of different types of trade; or through the study of a particular phase of the economy (such as production).

===Scalar approaches===

====Global scale====
[[World-systems theory]] and [[network theory]] are commonly-used analytical tools that study global trade and exchange.
 
In the 1970s, [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] proposed [[World-systems theory]] to study the unequal relationships between developed “core” countries and underdeveloped “periphery” countries. Because of its strong analytical power in connecting societies under a comprehensive framework, world-systems theory was adapted by both anthropologists and archaeologists, who used it to study ancient societies (even though Wallerstein himself never agreed to this). [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]] and Thomas D. Hall apply the model to a range of human societies, from sedentary forager hamlets to the capitalist global system.&lt;ref name="Chase-DunnHall1991"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Christopher K. |last1=Chase-Dunn|first2=Thomas D. |last2=Hall|title=Core/periphery Relations in Precapitalist Worlds|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=jNZlQgAACAAJ}}|year=1991|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-7951-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Network theory attempts to make sense of individual objects within a broad web of connection with other objects. In the 1950s, social scientists used this theory as a quantitative method for more accurate social analysis. This was known as social network theory and focused on the contact patterns of individuals and social groups. The connections between entities are “mapped out” to show the frequency and strength of connections across space and time, demonstrating the relative importance of various nodes.

====Regional scale====
Regional approaches to trade and exchange generally take a meso-scalar focus: at the inter-regional (between) and the intra-regional (within) levels. Various approaches are used in both descriptive and explanatory frameworks of social systems and their transformation. These include peer polity interaction, interaction spheres, social network analysis and modified core-periphery models of Wallerstein’s world-systems theory. Peer polity interaction (PPI) was introduced by [[Colin Renfrew]] and John F. Cherry.&lt;ref name="RenfrewCherry1986"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Colin |last1=Renfrew|first2=John F. |last2=Cherry|title=Peer Polity Interaction and Socio-political Change|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=oP48AAAAIAAJ}}|date=29 May 1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-22914-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPI posits that regional interaction and competition can be drivers for social change. Polities, “the highest order sociopolitical unit in the region in question,” are considered autonomous from one another socio-politically, even though they may share aspects of trade, art, architecture and/or ideology. Through PPI, adjacent polities adopt or develop similar aspects of social complexity and archaeologists study how institutional features develop and how they are adopted. Interaction Spheres, developed by [[Joe Caldwell]] in 1964, examines how independent societies within and across regions could coherently interact within different institutional frameworks. Caldwell used the mortuary and ritual practices of the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell culture]] of North America as a prime example of an interaction sphere.&lt;ref name="CaldwellHall1970"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Joseph R. |last1=Caldwell|first2=Robert L. |last2=Hall|title=Hopewellian Studies|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ylcTnQEACAAJ}}|year=1970|publisher=Illinois State Museum|chapter=Interaction Spheres in Prehistory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like PPI, Interaction Spheres argues that interaction among different regional groups may leads to innovation in cultural traditions.

===Local scale (household)===
Trade between households and trade within communities are both “local” scales of analysis that can play a major role in shaping both domestic economies and large-scale systems. Ordinary goods—often produced at the household-level—are a significant part of community sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Monica|title=The Role of Ordinary Goods in Premodern Exchange|journal=Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory|volume=6|pages=109–132|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the local economy may consume most of the daily activities for a community, thereby defining the identity of many ancient peoples. Study of the local economy may also highlight the role of marginalized groups ([[gender]], [[class (social)|class]], etc.) that may have a significant impact in the economy. The study of household-level production and trade may also be used to extrapolate larger systems of trade and exchange.

==Types of trade==
[[Staple food|Staple]] or adornment goods move between individuals of the same or different groups by multiple modes. Those modes include those identified by Polanyi (reciprocity, redistribution and exchange) and market exchange.

===Reciprocity===
In [[cultural anthropology]], [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] is the non-market exchange of goods or labor ranging from [[barter]] to gift exchange. The act of giving creates a tacit commitment to provide a service or object in return at some future time.

===Redistribution===
[[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|Redistribution]] concerns the distribution of power within a society. Within a [[chiefdom]], the chief accumulates goods and resources from the population to later redistribute them according to local custom.

===Exchange===
Exchange and—more significantly—market exchange involves specific places (marketplaces) where goods and services can be negotiated and purchased. Archaeologists argue that evidence reveals market exchange in pre-Industrial societies such as the Prehistoric [[Hohokam]], the [[Aztecs]] and the [[Maya people|Maya]]. &lt;ref name="GarratyStark2015"&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher P. |last=Garraty|last2=Stark|first2=Barbara L.|title=Archaeological Approaches to Market Exchange in Ancient Societies|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Mxq8rQEACAAJ}}|date=15 April 2015|publisher=University Press of Colorado|isbn=978-1-60732-370-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Market economies have involved signature features such as commodities, set prices and regulating institutions.

==Trade as a process==
The production, circulation and consumption of goods provide another way that ancient trade and exchange can be studied. [[Production (economics)|Production]] concerns the activity by which ideas are materialized in utilitarian and ritual goods. In archaeology, production is most often associated with either the sources of specific materials or labor specialization. Circulation is the flow of products from the source or the place of manufacture toward locations with sufficient demand for that product. [[Consumption (economics)|Consumption]] is the acquisition and use of products. These three components of the commodity chain may be studied separately or in tandem.

==Techniques==

===Sourcing===
Sourcing involves identifying the characteristic properties of the raw materials used to fashion items in order to determine the original material source of an artifact. It helps to determine social, political and economic connections among groups. Pinpointing the locations of sources helps archaeologists analyze the distribution range of goods and/or commodities. In order for sourcing to be effective, something must distinguish the material source from similar sources. For materials such as [[obsidian]], determining the source can be easy; while for others, such as [[flint]] and some metals, it is more difficult. Moreover, not all materials can provide good data for sourcing, such as organic remains. Analytical methods used for sourcing may include:&lt;ref name="RenfrewBahn2016"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Colin |last1=Renfrew|first2=Paul |last2=Bahn|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods, and Practice|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6mzxsgEACAAJ}}|date=18 January 2016|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-29210-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[X-ray diffraction]]

===Agent-based modeling===
[[Agent-based model]]ing (ABM) is the simulation of agents (humans and social systems) based on a series of specified inputs. It models how humans (agents) and societies respond to inputs and stresses. For example, archaeologists working on social interactions in the Roman world used ABM to understand how social exchange affected the development of Roman expansionism in different regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Shawn| title=Networks, Agent-Based Models, and the Antonine Itineraries: Implications for Roman Archaeology|journal=Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology|volume=19|pages=45–64|year=2006|url=https://www.academia.edu/598316/Networks_agent-based_models_and_the_Antonine_itineraries_implications_for_Roman_archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, archaeologists working on human subsistence mechanisms modeled how economics affected social complexity in Eastern North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Andrew A.| title=Subsistence Economics, Family Size, and the Emergence of Social Complexity in Hunter-Gatherer Systems in Eastern North America|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|volume=31|pages=122–163|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographic information systems===
[[Geographic information system]]s (GIS) provide an environment to model and measure the conditions by which spatial relationships develop and change. GIS software serves as an important tool to visualize such metrics. In [[Mexico]], archaeologists used GIS models to examine transportation corridors between sites that prove useful in learning about trade relationships among polities through time. Archaeologists working in the Caribbean used GIS to model cultural landscapes to assess cultural and economic change in plantation societies. In the South American Andes, archaeologists used GIS to understand the exchange of the goods and ideologies of [[Chavín De Huantar]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">In [[epidemiology]], the '''attack rate''' is the biostatistical measure of frequency of [[morbidity]], or speed of spread, in an at risk population. It is used in hypothetical predictions and during actual [[outbreaks]] of disease. An at risk population is defined as one that has no immunity to the attacking pathogen which can be either a [[novel pathogen]] or an established pathogen. It is used to project the number of victims to expect during an [[epidemic]]. This aids in marshalling resources for delivery of medical care as well as production of vaccines and/or anti-viral and anti-bacterial medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony N. Glaser. High-Yield Biostatistics. Williams &amp; Wilkins. Baltimore. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The rate is arrived at by taking the number of new cases in the population at risk and dividing by the number of persons at risk in the population.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mbox{number of new cases in the population at risk}}{\mbox{number of persons at risk in the population}}=\mbox{Rate}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Rates are determined from the beginning of the [[outbreak]] to its end. The term should probably not be described as a rate because its time dimension is uncertain. While the duration of an epidemic can be predicted given other variables such as early intervention, it cannot be known in absolute terms. In epidemiology, a rate requires a defined unit change (in this instance, time) over which the rate applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = International Epidemiological Association | title = A Dictionary of Epidemiology. (Last JM, editor) | edition = 4th | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-19-514169-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it is often referred to as an attack ratio.

'''Billy Yank''' or '''Billy Yankee''' is the personification of the [[Northern United States|Northern states]] of the [[United States]], or less generally, the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell Irvin Wiley. 1952. The Life of Billy Yank: The Common Soldier of the Union. Indianapolis: Charter Books. Pages 454.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of his name is derived from ''[[yankee]]'', a slang term for [[New England]]ers. Political cartoonists used Billy Yank and his [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] counterpart [[Johnny Reb]] to symbolize the [[combatants]] in the American Civil War of the 1860s.

Billy Yank is usually pictured wearing a regulation Yankee wool uniform that included the [[fatigue blouse]], a light-weight wool coat with an inside pocket and four brass buttons on the front, with a [[kepi]]-style forage cap made of wool broadcloth with a rounded, flat top, cotton lining, and leather visor.

==Comics==
In the universe of the [[DC Comics]], the "Spirit of America" appeared first in human form as the [[Minuteman]] and then [[Brother Jonathan]] before splitting in two during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the war, the two halves of its essence ([[Johnny Reb]] and Billy Yank) recombined to form [[Uncle Sam]].

The '''Capitoline Wolf''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Lupa Capitolina'') is a [[bronze]] sculpture depicting a scene from the legend of the [[founding of Rome]]. The sculpture shows a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] suckling the mythical twin founders of Rome, [[Romulus and Remus]]. According to the legend, when [[Numitor]], grandfather of the twins, was overthrown by his brother [[Amulius]], the usurper ordered them to be cast into the [[Tiber River]]. They were rescued by a she-wolf who cared for them until a herdsman, [[Faustulus]], found and raised them.

The age and origin of the Capitoline Wolf is controversial.  The statue was long thought to be an [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] work of the 5th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/Lanciani/LANARD/11*.html (Lacus Curtius website) Rodolfo Lanciani, ''Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries'' ch.

==Description==
The sculpture is somewhat larger than life-size, standing {{convert|75|cm}} high and {{convert|114|cm}} long. The wolf is depicted in a tense, watchful pose, with alert ears and glaring eyes which are watching for danger. By contrast, the human twins – executed in a completely different style – are oblivious to their surroundings, absorbed by their suckling.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, Christin J. Mamiya. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', p. 241. Wadsworth, 2004. {{ISBN|0-534-64095-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution and dating==
The she-wolf from the legend of Romulus and Remus was regarded as a symbol of Rome from ancient times. Several ancient sources refer to statues depicting the wolf suckling the twins. [[Livy]] reports in his ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Roman history]]'' that a statue was erected at the foot of the Palatine Hill in 295 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Livy ''Ab Urbe Condita Book X ch.23&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions the presence in the [[Roman Forum]] of a statue of a she-wolf that was "a miracle proclaimed in bronze nearby, as though she had crossed the [[Comitium]] while [[Attus Navius]] was taking the omens". [[Cicero]] also mentions a statue of the she-wolf as one of a number of sacred objects on the Capitoline that had been inauspiciously struck by [[lightning]] in the year 65 BC: "it was a gilt statue on the Capitol of a baby being given suck from the udders of a wolf."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.etc.ucla.edu/projects/Forum/resources/primarysources/Cicero_Cat._3.19  ''[[In Catilinam]]'' 3.19.]&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero also mentions the wolf in ''[[De Divinatione]]'' 1.20 and 2.47.&lt;ref&gt;([http://dlib.etc.ucla.edu/projects/Forum/resources/Richardson/Ficus_Navia L. Richardson Jr.,] "[[Ficus Navia]]").&lt;/ref&gt;

It was widely assumed that the Capitoline Wolf was the very sculpture described by Cicero, due to the presence of damage to the sculpture's paw, which was believed to correspond to the lightning strike of 65 BC. The 18th-century German art historian [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] attributed the statue to an Etruscan maker in the 5th century BC, based on how the wolf's fur was depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Haskell, Nicholas Penny. ''Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Classical Sculpture, 1500–1900'', p. 241. Yale University Press, 1981. {{ISBN|0-300-02641-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first attributed to the [[Veii]]an artist [[Vulca]], who decorated the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus]], and then re-attributed to an unknown Etruscan artist of approximately 480–470 BC. Winckelmann correctly identified a [[Renaissance]] origin for the twins; they were probably added in 1471 or later.&lt;ref name="laregina2006"&gt;Adriano La Regina, "[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma.html Roma, l'inganno della Lupa è "nata" nel Medioevo]''. ''La Repubblica''. 17 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, a number of researchers questioned Winckelmann's dating of the bronze. [[August Emil Braun]], the secretary of the Archaeological Institute of Rome, proposed in 1854 that the damage to the wolf's paw had been caused by an error during casting. Wilhelm Fröhner, the Conservator of the [[Louvre]], stated in 1878 that style of the statue was attributable to the [[Carolingian art]] period rather than the Etruscan, and in 1885 [[Wilhelm von Bode]] also stated that he was of the view that the statue was most likely a mediaeval work. However, these views were largely disregarded and had been forgotten by the 20th century.&lt;ref name="laregina2006" /&gt;

In 2006, the Italian art historian Anna Maria Carruba and the Etruscologist Adriano La Regina contested the traditional dating of the wolf on the basis of an analysis of the [[casting]] technique. Carruba had been given the task of restoring the sculpture in 1997, enabling her to examine how it had been made. She observed that the statue had been cast in a single piece, using a variation of the [[lost-wax casting]] technique. This technique was not used in [[Classical antiquity]]; ancient Greek and Roman bronzes were typically constructed from multiple pieces, a method that facilitated high-quality castings, with less risk than would be involved in casting the entire sculpture at once. Single-piece casting was, however, widely used in the [[Middle Ages]] to mould bronze items that needed a high level of rigidity, such as [[bell]]s and [[cannon]]s. Carruba argues, like Braun, that the damage to the wolf's paw had resulted from an error in the moulding process. In addition, La Regina, who is the state superintendent of Rome's cultural heritage, argues that the sculpture's artistic style is more akin to Carolingian and [[Romanesque art]] than that of the ancient world.&lt;ref name="laregina2006" /&gt;

Radiocarbon and [[thermoluminescence]] dating was carried out at the [[University of Salento]] in February 2007 to resolve the question.  The results revealed with an accuracy of 95.4 percent that the sculpture was crafted between the 11th and 12th century AD.

==History of the sculpture==

[[File:She-wolf of Rome.JPG|thumb|right|The sculpture in Musei Capitolini]]

It is unclear when the sculpture was first erected, but there are a number of mediaeval references to a "wolf" standing in the Pope's [[Lateran Palace]]. In the 10th century ''Chronicon'' of [[Benedict of Soracte]], the monk chronicler writes of the institution of a supreme court of justice "in the Lateran Palace, in the place called the Wolf, viz, the mother of the Romans." Trials and executions "at the Wolf" are recorded from time to time until 1438.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo Lanciani, ''New Tales of Old Rome'', p. 38. Ayer Publishing, 1968. {{ISBN|0-405-08727-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th-century English cleric [[Magister Gregorius]] wrote a descriptive essay ''De Mirabilibus Urbis Romae''&lt;ref&gt;G. McN. Rushforth, "Magister Gregorius de Mirabilibus Urbis Romae: A New Description of Rome in the Twelfth Century", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'' '''9''' (1919, pp. 14–58), p. 28f. Magister Gregorius' description seems independent of the well-known topography ''[[Mirabilia Urbis Romae]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded in an appendix three pieces of sculpture he had neglected: one was the Wolf in the [[portico]], at the principal entrance to the Lateran Palace. He mentions no twins, for he noted that she was set up as if stalking a bronze ram that was nearby, which served as a [[fountain]]. The wolf had also served as a fountain, Magister Gregorius thought, but it had been broken off at the feet and moved to where he saw it.&lt;ref&gt;''Lupa etiam quondam singulis mammis aquam abluendis manibus emittebat, sed nunc fractis pedibus a loco suo divulsa est''&lt;/ref&gt;

The present-day Capitoline Wolf could not have been the sculpture seen by Benedict and Gregorius, if its newly attributed age is accepted, though it is conceivable that it could have been a replacement for an earlier (now lost) depiction of the Roman wolf. In December 1471 [[Pope Sixtus IV]] ordered the present sculpture to be transferred to the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]] on the Capitoline Hill, and the twins were added some time around then. The Capitoline Wolf joined a number of other genuinely ancient sculptures transferred at the same time, to form the nucleus of the [[Capitoline Museums|Capitoline Museum]].

==Modern use and symbolism==
[[File:Capitoline Wolf at Siena Duomo.jpg|thumb|Capitoline Wolf at [[Siena Duomo]]. According to a legend [[Siena]] was founded by [[Senius and Aschius]], two sons of Remus. When they fled [[Rome]], they took the statue of the She-wolf to Siena, which became the symbol of the town.]]
The image was favoured by [[Benito Mussolini]], who cast himself as the founder of the "[[New Rome]]" and donated [[List of Capitoline Wolf statues|copies of the statue to various places around the world]].&lt;ref name=Atlas&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laskow|first1=Sarah|title=Neither Rome, GA, Nor Rome, NY, Could Handle a Statue with Wolf Teats|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/neither-rome-ga-nor-rome-ny-could-handle-a-statue-with-wolf-teats|accessdate=5 January 2018|work=Atlas Obscura|date=16 October 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage [[United States|American]] goodwill, he sent several copies of the Capitoline Wolf to U.S. cities.

The Capitoline Wolf was used on both the [[emblem]] and the [[poster]] for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome. The Roman football club [[A.S. Roma]] uses it in its emblem as well.

The Capitoline Wolf was used as the logo for [[Artie Ripp|Artie Ripp's]] record label [[Artie Ripp#Family Productions|Family Productions]], which in 1971 released [[Billy Joel|Billy Joel's]] first album as a solo artist, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]''. Due to contractual obligations, it continued to appear on numerous Joel albums even after he was subsequently signed to [[Columbia Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/billy-joel-is-angry-19800904|date=September 4, 1980|accessdate=June 11, 2018|work=Rolling Stone|last1=White|first1=Timothy|title=Billy Joel Is Angry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme of conservation undertaken in the 1990s resulted in an exhibition devoted to the ''Lupa Capitolina'' and her iconography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museicapitolini.org/en/eventi/mostre_lupa.htm Capitoline Museums: Exhibition "The Capitoline She-Wolf", June–October 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516045944/http://www.museicapitolini.org/en/eventi/mostre_lupa.htm |date=16 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 film ''[[Agora (film)|Agora]]'', set in 5th-century [[Alexandria]], the Capitoline Wolf—complete with the del Pollaiolo twins—can be seen in the prefect's palace.  This is visible in the scene before [[Hypatia]]'s capture, directly behind her character.
In Rick Riordan's [[The Son of Neptune]], Lupa is the wolf that trains all demigods who wish to enter Camp Jupiter.  She trains [[Percy Jackson]] and is mentioned that she trained [[Jason Grace]] also.

In the first episode of the American television programme ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', a mirror-image sculpture of the Capitoline Wolf is on display in the Addams's living room. It can be seen standing atop a table, just to the right of the main staircase.

The [[Boston Latin School]] uses an image on the cover of their agenda book as well as being the official school emblem.

The Capitoline Wolf is used in Romania and Moldova as a symbol of the Latin origin of its inhabitants and in some major cities there are replicas of the original statue given as a gift from Italy at the beginning of the 20th century.

The Capitoline Wolf is reimagined in ''[[Look at Me (new Capitoline Wolf)]]'', a 2011 [[Installation art|installation]] by [[Poland|Polish]] artist [[Paweł Wocial]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The '''Chest of Saint Simeon''' or '''Saint Simeon's Casket''' ({{lang-hr|Škrinja sv. Šimuna}}) is a rectangular [[cedar wood|cedarwood]] [[sarcophagus]] in the shape of a ''[[Chasse (casket)|chasse]]'', overlaid with silver and silver-gilt plaques, said to hold the relics of [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|St Simon the God-receiver]]; it is located over the main altar in the Church of Saint Simeon in [[Zadar]], [[Croatia]]. The chest, considered a masterpiece of medieval art and also a unique monument of the goldsmith's craft of the age, is one of the most interesting works in gold in Europe now under the protection of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name="Marijan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wingfield"/&gt; It was made by local goldsmiths to an Italian design between 1377 and 1380.

==History==

===The legend of the chest===
Eastern Roman emperors who were seated in Constantinople in the sixth century were not only expanding their collection of valuable works of art, but also relics of saints in order to be able to stand side by side with Rome's. So, between 565 and 568 AD the sarcophagus where the remains of St. Simeon were being kept was moved from [[Syria]] to [[Constantinople]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27414/Anthony-Of-Novgorod|title=Anthony Of Novgorod|author=Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;According to some historians, the saint's body was translated from Jerusalem to Constantinople in the second half of the 6th century while others state that it was brought to Constantinople from Syria. The mentioning of the [[Dubrovnik Cathedral]] as his first resting place in Dalmatia after his transfer from Palestine also appears in a verse-chronicle of the [[Dubrovnik|Ragusan]] poet Miletius from 1159.&lt;/ref&gt; where it stayed until the year 1203 when it was then shipped to [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seymour Jr|first=Charles|title=The Tomb of Saint Simeon the Prophet in San Simeone Grande, Venice|year=1976|publisher=International Center of Medieval Art|pages=193|jstor=766767|OCLC=4893277455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madden|first=Thomas F.|title=International History Review|work=Vows and Contracts in the Fourth Crusade: The Treaty of Zara and the Attack on Constantinople in 1204|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|jstor=40106727|volume=15|pages=441–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Rourke|first=Michael|title=The Last Era of Roman Magnificence: 12th Century Byzantium and the Kommenoi Emperors|work=Byzantium under the Kommenoi Emperors|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/46449324/The-Last-Era-of-Roman-Magnificence-12th-Century-Byzantium-and-the-Komnenoi-Emperors|publisher=Scribd|year=2011|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The surviving ''Pilgrim’s Book'', written by Daniel and Anthony of Novgorod, monk and archbishop of [[Novgorod]], during their visit to Constantinople in 1200, testifies that the relics of the saint were still in Istanbul at the time. Legends relate that his body arrived in Zadar in 1203, 1213, 1243 or 1273 respectively, but despite the many dates and places the theory that the Eastern emperor's nephew [[Alexios IV Angelos|Alexius Angelus]] conspired with Venetians and Frankish crusaders to plounder the city of Zadar on their way to Constantinople in 1201 ([[Treaty of Venice]]) may sound quite possible to some researchers once the purpose of the plan was to defray part of the transporting cost of the expedition which the crusaders were unable to pay to Venice. In December 1202 Alexius IV promised aid and money in return for restoration to his throne, so like this the Treaty of Zara was signed in January 1203 and the [[Fourth Crusade]] proceeded against Christian Constantinople, despite protests from the Pope because the act represented a brutal assault on a Catholic town by Catholic troops. There is a mosaic in the Basilica of San Giovanni Batista in Ravenna, Italy, that portrays the invasion of Zadar by the crusaders (1208).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, the tradition of the worship of St. Simeon at Zadar began after the arrival of a Venetian merchant there who was transporting the relics of the saint in a stone sarcophagus when his ship was caught in a storm off Zadar, on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. While the city repaired his ship, he secretly buried the sarcophagus in a cemetery nearby so as to keep it safe from any danger; soon after that he got very ill. He sought refuge at an inn at the head of Zadar's harbour,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;This is the place where today stands the parish church of St. John.&lt;/ref&gt; where monks began to treat him. Seeing that his medical condition had worsened, they took all of his documents and found an inscription hanging around his neck reporting the miraculous powers of the saint. Oddly enough, that same night, three rectors appeared to them in a dream and warned each one individually that the remains of the holy saint were really buried in that said cemetery. Early in the following morning, as they walked to the site where they expected to find that stone sarcophagus, they told one another about their vision and so realised that they all had shared the same dream. They got to the grave where the chest had been hidden and dug it out of the ground, unaware of the real powers of its content. Shortly after that, gossips about this story reported by the monks and miracles performed in the name of the saint began to spread around the region inciting to the locals to refuse to let his body leave Zadar.&lt;ref name="Arambašić"/&gt;

When the remains of St. Simeon first came to Zadar they were deposed in the cemetery of a suburban monastery (Church of the Virgin - ''Velika Gospa''),&lt;ref name="Marijan"/&gt; which later became associated with the city's pilgrims hospice, until they were transferred to the sacristy of the female monastery of [[St. Mary Major]], where they remained until its demolition to make room for the construction of the city walls in 1570.&lt;ref name="Bousfield"&gt;Bousfield  Jonathan (2003).

===The theft of the finger===
In 1371, [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]],&lt;ref&gt;Fabijančić, Tony (2003). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sppa_IWNmosC&amp;pg=PA112 Croatia: travels in undiscovered country]'', The University of Alberta Press, pp. 112. {{ISBN|0-88864-397-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia]], and Queen of Hungary and Croatia as wife of one of the most powerful European rulers of his time, [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis I]], visited the city of Zadar.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Jelič, however, reported that this event happened during the king's entrance in Zadar and not in 1371.&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, during a religious mass, she furtively cracked off a piece of St. Simeon's finger and hid it in the breast of her dress, where it immediately began to decompose, a process which miraculously reverted itself when she returned the piece to the saint's hand. Confused by the appearing wound on her bosom and without being able to continue up to the point where she could safely exit from the church, most probably because of the maggots that infested the broken piece,&lt;ref name="Bousfield"/&gt; she ran blindly through the aisle of the church only to find out that she would soon be morally forced to restore the piece back to its original place under the accusatory and inquisitive glances exchanged by the many noblemen who formed a circle around her.

[[File:HAZU 47 17 lipnja 2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A replica of the chest as seen in the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]]]
When Elizabeth finally left the church she promised to honour the saint by presenting the church with a gift ornated in gold that she later came to commission to the Milanese goldsmith Francesco di Antonio da Sesto (Francis of Milan), who was asked to create a paper model with drawings of all the details to be discussed and approved by the queen's representatives so that their legibility and presentation might be in accordance with the royal expectations and deep interest in the making of such precious shrine. The intricate carvings were dexterously executed between 1377 and 1380 and was  assisted by Andrija Markov from [[Zagreb]], Petar Blažev from Reča, Stejpan Pribičev and Mihovil Damjanov.&lt;ref name="Qantara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossiter"&gt;Rossiter, Stuart (1969); ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dN0bAAAAMAAJ Yugoslavia: the Adriatic Coast]'', Benn, pp. 102. {{ISBN|0-510-02505-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Although Francis of Milan could have taken on assistants because of the urgency of the job, it is known today from documents that he only took on only one apprentice and one trained goldsmith who was engaged at the end of the work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The commission of the chest by Elizabeth is recorded in a document dated 5 July 1377 in Zadar. It reveals the techniques used in the making of the chest and also attests that the donation of the 240&amp;nbsp;kg of silver used to decorate the surface of the chest came from "Elizabeta" herself. It was most probably given to Zadar because the Royal couple needed the support of its people. Even being the commissioning of reliquary shrines a typical way by which medieval queens attempted to secure their political recognition, it was the period when the city frequently belonged to the [[Venetian Empire]] and the territory of the Croatian-Hungarian king. Thus Louis I, engaged in keeping Zadar away from the clutches of Venice, wanted a strong community to form a strong bond between the south Italian possessions and the Polish and Croatian-Hungarian state. For this reason, St. Simeon was the best choice for being the most popular saint in Zadar. But the Angevin chapter of Zadar's history, which began in 1350, ended in 1409 when [[Ladislaus of Naples]], the descendant of [[Elizabeth the Cuman]], sold Zadar and its duchy to the Venetian Republic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent events===
In 2007 the Archbishop of Zadar and the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem agreed that the Archdiocese would provide a piece of the body of the saint to the Patriarchate of Jerusalem to be venerated in the Church of the Katamon Monastery of St. Simeon. Arrangements were made with the Congregation of Divine Worship and Cult of Saints in Rome and the small silver reliquiary, constraining a particle measuring 5 x 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm and bearing the Latin inscription: "Ex corporis Sancti Simeoni Iusti Zadar 7. octobris 2010", was solemnly handed over to the representatives of the Orthodox Church during the celebration of Vespers in the eastern part of the historic quarters of Zadar.&lt;ref name=Marijan /&gt;

==Description of the chest==

===Dimensions===
The rectangular silver chest of Saint Simeon, standing 2.3&amp;nbsp;m above the ground on the main altar of the church of the same name,&lt;ref name=Cilauro/&gt; measures 1.92&amp;nbsp;m long by 62.5&amp;nbsp;cm wide and, including the 56&amp;nbsp;cm high saddle-shaped lid, 1.27&amp;nbsp;m high.&lt;ref name="Qantara"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Simeon's Shrine|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=1454&amp;lang=en|publisher=Qantara - Mediterranean Heritage|accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front side of the lid is dominated by the carved reclining figure of the saint dressed in a gown and cloak richly ornamented with plant motifs made by punching fastened on his breast by a clasp. The front panel, which unfolds by means of hinges located on the bottom displaying the saint's laid-down figure, measures 66.5&amp;nbsp;cm high.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt; It is raised by the outstretched arms of four bronze angels forged from seventeenth century Turkish cannons that were seized in the waters of Zadar in 1648.&lt;ref&gt;Raos, Ivan (1969). ''[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=The+bronze+figures+bearing+the+coffin+of++Simeon+were+cast+from+Turkish+cannons+#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;source=hp&amp;q=%22The+bronze+figures+bearing+the+coffin+of+St.+Simeon+were+cast+from+Turkish+cannons+seized+in+Zadar%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=7a8f28651437ace4 Adriatic tourist guide]'', Spektar, pp. 113. {{OCLC|112865}} on [[Google Search]] Retrieved 15 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Covered inside and outside with a thin lamina of 240&amp;nbsp;kg of pure silver and also a considerable quantity of gold, it shows intricate details carved on the cedar wood used to give shape to the chest. All free surface of the chest is filled in with more or less standard vine, leaves and winding rosettes of sinuate leaves ornamentations decorated with gold.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"&gt;Petricioli, Ivo. (1996). ''Artistic innovations on the silver shrine of St. Simeon in Zadar'', Hortus artium medievalium (vol. II), Zagreb - Motovun, pp. 9-17. {{OCLC|34729563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Munk"/&gt;

===Relief compositions===
The front part of the chest displays enhanced relief compositions depicting scenes from the saint's early years as a preacher, death and ascension into heaven on the back of a virgin,&lt;ref name="Cilauro"&gt;Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Rob Sitch (2003). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3K3hp3fOJtMC&amp;pg=PA58 Molvania: a land untouched by modern dentistry]'';  Hardie Grant Books, pp. 58. {{ISBN|978-1-74066-110-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as biblical and historical events of his time. The inside part contains a relief made by goldsmith Stjepan Martinič of Zadar representing the patron saints of the city in the background.&lt;ref name=Qantara/&gt; The inside of the lid is magnificently illustrated with three miracles attributed to the saint. His holy monk-like figure and two sets of the arms of Anjou also appear in high relief on both the triangle areas of the lid. They are both richly decorated in the same manner together with the shield of Hungarian bars and the characteristic Angevin fleur-de-lis, a cloak and a helmet with a crown. Above the crowns rises an ostrich with outspread wings and a horseshoe in its beak. Around the coat of arms there are reliefs of [[Acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves, and beside them the initials of the king: L.R. ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Lodovicus Rex'').&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The same coat of arms in the shape of a buckle can be found in the treasury of [[Aachen Cathedral]] once Ludvig I was the grandson of [[Charles Martel of Anjou|Charles Martel]], the son of [[Charles II of Naples]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HAZU 48 17 lipnja 2008.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The Latin inscription.]]
The Latin inscription on the central panel on the back of the chest, which corresponds to the main composition on the front panel, bears the goldsmith's signature with Louis's coat of arms in the corners of the richly worked vine tracery that complements the relief. It is divided in two parts, being the larger with the main inscription in Gothic capital letters beaten in high relief: "SYMEON: HI.C.IVSTVS.YEXVM.DE.VIRGINE.NATVM.VLNIS: QVI.TENVITHAC.ARCHA. PACE.QVIESCIT.HVNGARIE.REGINA.POTENS: ILLVSTRIS: ED.ALTA: ELYZABET.IUNIOR:QVAM.VOTO:CONTVLIT. ALMO.ANNO.MILLENO: TRECENO: OCTVAGENO." Below, angraved in stylized minuscule letters, appears the goldsmith's signature: "hoc.opus.fecit: franciscus.d.mediolano."&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;

Known in medieval Latin hexameters, the translation of the inscription reads as follows: "Simeon the Righteous, holding Jesus, born of a virgin, in his arms, rests in peace in this chest, commissioned by the Queen of Hungary, mighty, glorious and majestic Elizabeth the Younger, in the year 1380. This is the work of Francis of Milan".&lt;ref name=Marijan/&gt;

===Main scenes===
The scenes are separated by columns surmounted by small heads of angels sculpted during the two-year restoration process started in 1630.&lt;ref name="Qantara"/&gt; The work was conducted by the goldsmiths Constantino Piazzalonga of Venice and Benedetto Libani of Zadar, who reduced the length of the chest by four and the width by three fingers.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 1"&gt;Petricioli, Ivo (1983). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=e5osAQAAIAAJ St. Simeon's shrine in Zadar]'', Drago Zdunić, pp. 26-31. {{OCLC|12301571}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Sir Thomas Graham (1887).

*'''The Arrival of King Louis I in Zadar''', the right scene on the front panel depicting the town walls, gates and ramparts, includes a Romanesque cloister beside a church, a contemporary ship in a storm and several figures clad in garments with caps typical of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Ivančević, Radovan (1986). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=s6OfAAAAMAAJ Art treasures of Croatia]'', IRO Motovun - Belgrade: Jugoslovenska revija, pg. 97, {{OCLC|18052634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis I triumphantly enters the Zadar harbour dressed in ceremonial robes escorting the shrine, which is being carried in the middleground, after relieving the city from an eighteen-month siege. To the left of the king are five figures kneeling humbly and above them the short-bearded figure of Archbishop Nikola Matafar blessing the king.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;From a historical point of view, this is the most interesting piece of work as it interprets an almost contemporary event to the making of the chest. The returning of the saint's body to the place from which the Venetians had probably removed him during their ten-year-long rule, although this information is not confirmed in historical sources.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Presentation in the Temple''', the central relief on the front panel, is one depicting St. Simeon taking into his arms the infant Jesus under a four-squared-column ciborium. To the left stands Joseph holding a pigeon, and to the right the prophetess Anne holding an unrolled scroll in her left hand.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 1"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The central relief on the front of the chest, is believed to be a work based on a [[fresco]] by [[Giotto]], in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] (Cappella dell'Arena) in [[Padua]], or it might be a work based on another of Giotto's smaller paintings today in the Gardner Museum in Boston. This way Francis of Milan introduced the work of this grand master to [[Dalmatia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Discovery of the Saint's Body''', the scene on the left-hand side of the frontal panel shows a group of three rectors on the left bottom corner. The first has lifted a forefinger while the central figure has raised two, one in each hand. The third is pointing his left thumb over his shoulder at the other monks exhuming the body of the saint. The left monk swings a hoe above his head while the central figure kneels and holds a lantern, which shows that the scene takes place at night. The third monk is kneeling and taking care of the saint's naked body.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Writers agree that this composition depicts the finding of St. Simeon's body in a cemetery of a Zadar suburban monastery.&lt;/ref&gt;

!'''Compositions located on the right and left sides of the chest.'''

|align="center"|
*'''The Boat in the Storm''' is the scene on the right shorter side of the chest, by the saints feet, where the drama of a situation showing high waves bearing the sides of a large sailing ship and sailors jettisoning goods overboard is very expressively shown. It is believed that it interprets the story of how the bones of St. Simeon came to Zadar. A monstrous horned demon is clutching one of the two masts of the ship while two rushed sailors desperately try to fasten the sail. One has climbed up the mast and is taking a rope which the other is passing over to him. A third sailor is throwing a bundle of merchandise in the sea while the captain, on an elevated stern holding the helm, gives orders to the sailors. The frightened passengers are gathered on the center of the ship.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;This is an artistically important motif for also being reminiscent of [[Giovanni di Balduccio]]'s stone relief on the sarcophagus of St. Eustorgius in Milan. Older writers have the opinion that this scene is a despiction of the boat that brought the &amp;nbsp;saint's relics to Zadar and that it tells the legend of [[Margaret of Durazzo]], wife of Duke [[Charles III of Naples|Charles of Durazzo]], Ludvig's relative, who took part of the saint's body and tried to leave Naples, but the boats which were to take them and their suite could not sail out of the harbour.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Theft of the Finger''' is the scene located beneath the other coat of arms, on the shorter side of the chest, by the saint's head. It has been interpreted in many ways because of the large number of figures represented.&lt;ref name="Gyug"&gt;Gyug, Richard Francis; (2002), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JEcVlPQjl24C&amp;pg=PA62 Medieval cultures in contact]'', [[Fordham University Press]], pp. 62. {{ISBN|0-8232-2212-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Research Center for Late Antiquity and Middle Ages (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn_rAAAAMAAJ Hortus artium medievalium]'', The Center, pp. 225 (Vol. 10). {{OCLC|34729563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burdick, Lewis Dayton (2002). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HcQDUxTlET0C&amp;pg=PA44 The hand: a survey of facts, legends, and beliefs pertaining to manual]'', [[Purdue University Press]], pp. 44. {{ISBN|1-55753-294-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stylized building symbolizing a church where the scene takes place and a large group of people ornately dressed around a woman similarly dressed with her left hand pointing to her bosom dominate the center of this composition. A point-bearded nobleman of long hair in very nice attire stands beside her and another with a cloak over his clothes seems to point to the door while he looks at the woman standing by the chest. Around them, other nobles with long plumes in their caps show signs of great surprise. In the right bottom, the saint's chest with its lid open and a woman dressed in the same way appears holding a wide finger in her hand.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Older writers say that this scene shows Elizabeta stealing one of St. Simeon's fingers in order to have a male heir. St. Simeon was frequently invoked for couples wishing to have a boy and the belief of stealing the finger of a saint dates at least from the time of the hagiographer [[Gregory of Tours]]. Ancient Romans consecrated every joint of the fingers of both hands to a saint and St. Simeon figures as the first joint of the middle finger of the left hand.&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="wikitable" style="width:100%"

!'''Compositions located on the back part of the chest.'''
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Death of Ban Kotromanič''' is a two-part scene where the Queen's father appears on his deathbed with St. Simeon and a boy invoking aid in the foreground. Beyond him lies the bed with the sick man and two women, who can only be seen from their waist up, standing in front of a curtain. Another boy is shown on the right with his hands clasped in prayer.&lt;ref name="Munk"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;As the Queen's father was a [[Ban of Bosnia|Bosnian Ban]], and Bosnian rulers were often accused of the [[Bogomilism|Bogumil heresy]], writers say that this scene is meant to show that he was a good Catholic and that the two boys represent the Ban's nephews Tvrtko and Vuk, who came to Zadar to entreat the saint to protect their uncle. Other writers suggest that both boys personify only the eldest of the two, who was crowned King of Bosnia and Serbia in October 1377.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''Queen Elizabeth with her daughters presenting the chest to the saint''' is the scene which appears to the left of the Latin inscription and that shows Elizabeth ceremoniously dressed in a long cloak edged with a decorated band and a fur collar that wraps her entire body and feet. Her three daughters, [[Catherine of Hungary (1370–1378)|Catherine]], [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]] and [[Jadwiga of Poland|Hedwig]],&lt;ref name="Munk"/&gt; are shown more simply dressed looking at the saint with their hands clasped in prayer.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Catherine (1370-1378) was seven years old, Mary (1371-1395) six and Hedwig (1373-1399) almost four at the time of the commissioning of the chest, so this relief must have been finished when Elizabeth's eldest daughter was still alive.&lt;/ref&gt;

!'''Compositions located on the inside part of the front panel.'''
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Possessed Nobleman''' is the first of the three miracles carved on the internal surface of the front panel, which opens in order to show the saint's body. It is depicted in two parts, with the first showing a young man with no beard and an older one with long hair and a beard, simply dressed and tightly holding a nobleman possessed by a demon, who is coming out of his mouth. In the second scene the younger man is kneeling with clasped hands thanking the saint for the healing.
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Young Boy's Resurrection''', the second scene, shows a small boat on a stormy sea and a man in it with a long hair and beard, and a tall cap on his head, rescuing a young boy out of the sea with a hook on a long staff. The second part of the scene shows a woman in a long cloak with her head covered laying the drowned boy on the chest. The same boy, brought back to life, can be seen kneeling with his hands clasped in the bottom left corner of the relief.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;These figures showing the same boy were not connected in literature and therefore were first wrongly described as two miracles instead of only one, however all three characters bear the same features, hair and attire in this composition.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Preaching of a Heretic Priest''', depicting the third miracle performed by the saint, is a scene in which a priest is shown in a pulpit under two pictures. The first is an illustration of Christ in the grave and the second the Virgin holding the infant Jesus. He is holding an open book in his left hand and pointing to the picture of the Virgin with his right. A great part of the surface of this relief is taken up by a large bed where the same priest is lying, naked as was the costume at the time. A bench and a curtain in the background compose the scene. Behind the bed stands St. Simeon raising a sword with his right hand.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;This scene has been interpreted as the preaching of the priest who attacked some religious teaching concerning the Virgin, so St. Simeon appeared in his dream with a sword and threatened him, so steering him to the right path of life.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''The Prejurer''' is one of the three scenes on the back of the lid. It depicts a building with arches on the ground floor and a man dressed in a long and wide coat falling beside it. To the right of the chest, a group of eight men are shown. The first of the two m an who appear entirely described, is touching the lid of the chest with his right hand while his left is held around the other who has clasped his hands. The bust of a third also appears, but only the crown of the remaining five heads are shown. A priest is shown watching the group.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;According with some writers, this composition shows either some false oath or a sacrilege committed by that man.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Goldsmith''' is the central composition and shows only three figures. A man kneeling on one leg before the saint's chest on posts with goldsmith's tools in his hand. He is looking at a bald-headed younger man kneeling by a column and a female figure with her head covered and wrapped in a long cloak is shown standing in front of an arch.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The content of this relief has not been well explained. The figure kneeling by the post seems to represent the goldsmith working in the church who appears surprised by the arrival of the young man accompanied by the woman.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Miracle with the Leg''' is the right-hand scene which depicts a group of four priests gathered behind the chest and a fifth at its right holding one of the saints legs with his right arm and the other raised up to his chin.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;This composition is considered by some writers to also represent the punishment of a prejurer whose sin was to become a madman for the stealing of the saint's leg, which miraculously grew together with the body again after being sent back to Zadar.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Note''': The visual narrative of ''The Theft of the Finger'' and two other scenes located on the back part of the chest have recently been considered to be all connected.&lt;ref name="Munk"&gt;Munk, Ana (2004).

'''''Crusader Gold''''' is an archaeological adventure novel by [[David Gibbins]]. First published in 2006, it is the second book in Gibbins' Jack Howard series. It has been published in more than 20 languages and was a New York Times bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/books/bestseller/1028bestpapermassfiction.html?scp=1&amp;sq=David%20Gibbins&amp;st=cse |title=Paperback Mass-Market Fiction - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2007-10-28 |accessdate=2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Following a prologue set in AD 71 when the golden [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] from the [[Jewish Temple in Jerusalem]] is locked away in Rome, the novel picks up in present-day Turkey with marine archaeologist Jack Howard on a hunt for ancient treasures in the harbour of Istanbul, formerly [[Constantinople]]. One item not among the treasures thrown into the harbour when the [[Crusades|Crusader]]s pillaged the city is the menorah, and Jack soon learns from colleagues Jeremy and Maria that it may have been stolen from Constantinople by Norse warrior [[Harald Hardrada]] during his service to the emperor of Constantinople and taken by him on his explorations of [[North America|the New World]].

Jack goes to the monastery at [[Iona]] in Scotland to see a priest who tells him that the Nazi Ahnenerbe were on the trail of the menorah in the 1930s. The priest is found gruesomely murdered, showing that there are present-day Nazis who are shadowing them. In Greenland Jack and his friend Costas dive inside an iceberg, where they find a perfectly preserved Viking ship burial containing one of Hardrada's warriors. They go to [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], the Viking site in Greenland, where further clues lead them to the Yucatán in Mexico, where Hardrada and his men had a final standoff with the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. After a perilous dive into a [[cenote]], Jack discovers the truth of Hardrada's last stand and the fate of the menorah, and he has his own final standoff with the latter-day Nazi and his henchmen who have been following him.

The book ends with a chapter-length Author's Note in which Gibbins details the historical and archaeological facts behind the fiction in the novel.

The '''Dedication of Nikandre''' is a Greek marble sculpture, made approximately around 650 BCE, held in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]], Greece (Inv. 1). Nikandre, a woman from the island of [[Naxos (city)|Naxos]], dedicated the statue in the temple of [[Artemis]] at [[Delos]], the birthplace of Apollo and Artemis. The statue, which was found during archaeological excavation in the 19th century, is one of the earliest surviving [[Kore (sculpture)|korai]], or statues of women, and displays one of the oldest inscriptions of Ancient Greek in stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jenkins|1936|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its representation and its placement within the existing stylistic periods of Greek sculpture have become the subject of extensive scholarship. 

==Discovery==

[[Théophile Homolle]] uncovered the statue amongst several other sculptural pieces in ditches while excavating around the sanctuary of Artemis in 1878. Homolle himself published slightly contradictory notes regarding the find spot of the pieces that make up Nikandre's dedication during the years following the discovery. As such, scholars have not been able to definitively place the location of Nikandre's dedication.&lt;ref name="Donohue_32"&gt;{{harvp|Donohue|2005|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of Homolle's notes, however, most agree that the statue was deposited in a ditch some 12 to 15 meters from the corner of the sanctuary of Artemis along with the pieces of several other statues.&lt;ref name="Donohue_32"/&gt; The purpose of this deposit is unclear, but the statues appear to have been broken before burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donohue|2005|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscription==

On the left side of the statue is the dedicatory inscription, one of the earliest surviving inscriptions of Greek in stone. It is incised vertically, in a manner known as [[boustrophedon]]. The original Greek is as follows: «Νικάνδρη μἀνέθεκεν (ε)κηβόλοι ἰοχεαίρηι Κόρη Δεινοδίκηο τῶ Ναησίο ἒησοχος ἀλήον Δεινομένεος δὲ κασιγνέτη Φηράησο δ᾽ ἂλοχος ν[ῦν].» An English translation, provided by G.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;A. Richter, is: "Nikandre dedicated me to the goddess, far-shooter of arrows, Nikandre, the daughter of Deinodikos of Naxos, distinguished among women, sister of Deinomenes and wife of Phraxos."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Richter|1968|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this inscription, we know the name and gender of the dedicant, Nikandre, as well as some vague hint of her intention (to please the goddess). In addition to defining herself by her relationship to her father (Deinodikos), husband (Phraxos), and brother (Deinomenes), she refers to herself as "distinguished among women", claiming some amount of glory and emphasizing her reputation in her community. Though the inscription may imply that the statue was made on the island of Naxos, where Nikandre's family resided (an implication corroborated by the type of stone used to make the statue), it is unclear who the sculptor was or where he lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Spivey|2013|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==

Scholars have yet to reach a consensus regarding whom the statue represents. Although it is tempting to initially assume that a dedicant, such as Nikandre, would commission a statue in her own likeness, the number of surviving female statues with male dedicants indicates that while possible in some situations, this could not be the general rule.

In an article published three years after the discovery, Homolle proposed that Nikandre's dedication as well as the other statues found with it each represent Artemis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donohue|2005|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most ''korai'', the prevailing assumption is that they represent [[Persephone]], but they could represent whichever goddess was worshiped at the sanctuary where the statues were dedicated, including [[Artemis]], [[Hera]], [[Athena]], [[Demeter]], and even [[nymph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Boardman|1978|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as G.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;A. Richter has pointed out, rarely are the individual korai accompanied by the appropriate attributes and objects that cult statues usually display, such as Athena's ''[[aegis]]'' on her statue in the [[Parthenon]].&lt;ref name="Richter_3"&gt;{{harvp|Richter|1968|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, Nikandre's statue does have small holes in the center of its hands.&lt;ref name="Richter_26"&gt;{{harvp|Richter|1968|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the sculptor could have made these holes to attach objects associated with Artemis, such as a bow, to the statue's hands.&lt;ref name="Richter_26"/&gt;

''Korai'' could alternatively represent the priestesses of those goddesses and sanctuaries. This interpretation has found quite a following among scholars. For example, John Boardman and Nigel Spivey both posit that the statue represents a priestess of Artemis.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Boardman|1978|loc=Fig. 71}}; {{harvp|Spivey|2013|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents to this theory argue that the youthful depiction of the ''korai'' is generally not associated with the image and the stature of a priestess, though there are instances of young maidens serving as priestesses (e.g. the worship of Artemis at Brauron).&lt;ref name="Richter_3"/&gt;

==Stylistic period==

One of the major controversies regarding Nikandre's dedication revolves around its placement within preexisting categories of Greek sculpture, specifically the Daedalic style in the 7th century BCE and the Greek Monumental Period that followed.&lt;ref name="Donohue_32"/&gt;

The Daedalic style, exhibited by followers of the mythological inventor [[Daedalus]] (the so-called Daidalidai, such as Endios, Dipoino, Skyllis, Tektaios, ''et al.''), flourished between 675 and 600 BCE.&lt;ref name="Boardman_13"&gt;{{harvp|Boardman|1978|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following features characterize the style:&lt;ref name="Boardman_13"/&gt;
* Strict frontality
* Dress
* Shape of head
* Hair
Nikandre's dedication conforms to many of these stylistic features, with its strict frontality (the statue faces straight forward without any twisting of the body), its rigid and unrevealing dress (a ''[[peplos]]'' belted at the waist), and its neatly combed hair, which hangs in tresses on either side of the figure's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jenkins|1936|pp=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek Monumental Period (660–650 BCE) was marked by life-sized sculpture, the origins of which several scholars trace to Greek cultural interaction with Egypt and Mesopotamia. In fact, Homolle notes in his initial publication regarding the sculpture that "the hair is spread out on the shoulders, pretty much in the manner of the hairstyle of the Egyptians - which at first sight gives are statue the look of an Egyptian work",&lt;ref&gt;As translated and quoted in {{harvp|Donohue|2005|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he later insists that such similarities are purely coincidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donohue|2005|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikandre's dedication, which stands {{convert|1.75|m}} tall and {{convert|0.17|m|abbr=on}} thick, is one of the earliest whole surviving life-size marble sculptures, meaning that many have attributed it to the start of this new period of Archaic monumental sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See the captions for the image of the dedication of Nikandre, Fig. 71 in Boardman's treatise on Archaic Greek sculpture as well as {{harvp|Ridgway|1993|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, this conflict between the statue's dating has little impact on the meaning of the dedication; it affects merely whether we interpret the statue as the end of one era or the beginning of the next. In the end, such eras are classifications imposed by modern archaeologists and scholars, and may not accurately reflect what was presumably a fluid development of the style and craft of [[Ancient Greek sculpture]].

==Reception==
In discussing the "problem of description" in archaeology, A.&amp;nbsp;A. Donohue has shown that historically, most scholars have described Nikandre's dedication in negative terms. Donohue holds that the "objective" description of archaeological objects has been anything but.&lt;ref name="Donohue_222"&gt;{{harvp|Donohue|2005|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an evaluation of the historical, ethnic, and psychological context of scholarly criticisms of the statue, Donohue illustrates how the reception of Nikandre's dedication today should not necessarily build on previous descriptions, which have often scorned the flat nature of the work and the heavy dress as poor craftsmanship.&lt;ref name="Donohue_222"/&gt; In comparison with later Hellenistic sculpture, which is characterized by a progressively idealistic treatment of the human form, Nikandre's dedication, with its heavy garment and blockish torso, appeared to many early scholars as wholly unfeminine. In contrast, Donohue argues that the heavy clothing and stance of the figure were meant to convey the respectability and stature of the female within her society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donohue|2005|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In feature-based [[phonology]], '''delayed release''' is a [[distinctive feature]] representing how quickly the closure in a non-[[continuant]] consonant is released. It separates [[stop consonant|stops]], which are [&amp;minus;delayed release], from [[affricate]]s, which are [+delayed release], both of which are [&amp;minus;[[sonorant]], &amp;minus;[[continuant]]].

In linguistics, according to J. Richard et al., (2002), an '''error''' is the use of a word, speech act or grammatical items in such a way it seems imperfect and significant of an incomplete learning (184). It is considered by Norrish (1983, p.&amp;nbsp;7) as a systematic deviation that happens when a learner has not learnt something, and consistently gets it wrong. However, the attempts made to put the error into context have always gone hand in hand with either Language Learning and Second Language acquisition processes, Hendrickson (1987:357) mentioned that errors are ‘Signal’ that indicate an actual Learning process taking place and that the learner has not yet mastered or shown a well-structured competence in the target language.

All the definitions seemed to stress either on the systematic deviations triggered in the language learning process, or its indications of the actual situation of the language learner themselves which will later help the monitor be it an applied linguist or particularly the language teacher to solve the problem respecting one of the approaches argued in the Error Analysis (Anefnaf 2017), the occurrence of errors doesn’t only indicate that the learner has not learned something yet, but also it gives the linguist the idea of whether the teaching method applied was effective or it needs to be changed.

According to Corder (1976) errors are significant of three things, first to the teacher, in that they tell him, if he or she undertakes a systematic analysis,  how far towards that goal the learner has progressed and, consequently, what remains for him to learn. Second, they provide the researcher with evidence of how language is learned or acquired, and what strategies or procedures the learner is employing in his discovery of the language. Third (and in a sense this is their most important aspect) they are indispensable to the learner himself, because we can regard the making of errors as a device the learner uses in order to learn (p.&amp;nbsp;167). The occurrence of errors is merely signs of ‘’the present inadequacy of our teaching methods’’ (Corder 1976, p. 163).

There have been two schools of thought when it comes to errors analysis and philosophy, the first one, according to Corder (1967) linked the errors commitment with the teaching method arguing that if the teaching method was adequate, the errors would not be committed, the second school believed that we live in an imperfect world and that errors correction is something real and the applied linguist cannot do without it no matter what teaching approach they may use.

== Errors vs. mistakes ==
Chomsky (1965) made a distinguishing explanation of competence and performance on which, later on, the identification of Mistakes and Errors will be possible, Chomsky stated that ‘’We thus make a fundamental distinction between competence (the speaker-hearer's knowledge of his language) and performance (the actual use of language in concrete situations)’’ ( 1956, p. 4). In other words, errors are thought of as indications of an incomplete learning, and that the speaker or hearer has not yet accumulated a satisfied language knowledge which can enable them to avoid linguistics misuse. Relating knowledge with competence was significant enough to represent that the competence of the speaker is judged by means of errors that concern the amount of linguistic data he or she has been exposed to, however, performance which is the actual use of language does not represent the language knowledge that the speaker has. According to J. Richard et al (2002)  people may have the competence to produce an infinitely long sentence but when they actually attempt to use this knowledge (to “perform”) there are many reasons why they restrict the number of adjectives, adverbs, and clauses in any one sentence (2002, 392).

The actual state of the speaker somehow involves and influences the speaker’s performance by either causing a good performance or mistakes. Thus, it is quite obvious that there are some kind of interrelationship between competence and performance; somehow, a speaker can perform well if he or she has had already a satisfied linguistics knowledge. As a support to this, Corder (1967) mentioned that Mistakes are of no significance to ‘’the process of language learning’’ (P. 167).

==Error analysis approach==
Before the rise of Error Analysis approach, Contrastive Analysis had been the dominant approach used in dealing and conceptualizing the learners’ errors in the 1950s, this approach had often gone hand in hand with concept of L1 Interference and precisely the Interlingual effect (Anefnaf Z. 2017), it claimed that the main cause of committing errors in the process of second language learning is the L1, in other words, the linguistic background of the language learners badly affects the production in the target language.

X. Fang and J. Xue-mei (2007) pointed out that Contrastive analysis hypothesis claimed that the principal barrier to second language acquisition is the interference of the first language system with the second language system and that a scientific, structural comparison of the two languages in question would enable people to predict and describe which are problems and which are not. Error Analysis approach overwhelmed and announced the decline of the Contrastive Analysis which was only effective in phonology. and According to J. Richard et al. (2002) EA developed as a branch of Linguistics in the 1960s and it came to light to argue that the mother tongue was not the main and the only source of the errors committed by the learners. In addition, Hashim, A. (1999) mentioned that the language effect is more complex and these errors can be caused even by the target language itself and by the applied communicative strategies as well as the type and quality of the second language instructions.

The aim of EA according to J. Richard et al. (2002) is, first, to identify strategies which learners use in language learning, in terms of the approaches and strategies used in both of teaching and learning. Second, to try to identify the causes of learners’ errors, that is, investigating the motives behind committing such errors as the first attempt to eradicate them. Third, to obtain information on common difficulties in Language Learning, as an aid to teaching or in the preparation of the teaching materials,

The two major causes of error, coined by the Error Analysis approach, are the Interlingual error which is an error made by the Learner’s Linguistic background and Native language interference, and the Intralingual error which is the error committed by the learners when they misuse some Target Language rules, considering that the error cause lies within and between the target language itself and the Learners false application of certain target language rules.

Error analysis in SLA was established in the 1960s by [[S. P. Corder|Corder]] and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Corder | first1 = S. P. | year = 1967 | title = The significance of learners' errors | url = | journal = International Review of Applied Linguistics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 160–170 | doi=10.1515/iral.1967.5.1-4.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Error analysis (EA) was an alternative to [[contrastive analysis]], an approach influenced by [[behaviorism]] through which applied linguists sought to use the formal distinctions between the learners' first and second languages to predict errors. Error analysis showed that contrastive analysis was unable to predict a great majority of errors, although its more valuable aspects have been incorporated into the study of [[#Language transfer|language transfer]]. A key finding of error analysis has been that many learner errors are produced by learners making faulty inferences about the [[wiktionary:rule|rules]] of the new language.

Error analysts distinguish between errors, which are systematic, and mistakes, which are not. They often seek to develop a [[wikt:typology|typology]] of errors. Error can be classified according to basic type:  omissive, additive, substitutive or related to [[word order]]. They can be classified by how apparent they are: ''overt'' errors such as "I angry" are obvious even out of context, whereas ''covert'' errors are evident only in context. Closely related to this is the classification according to ''domain'', the breadth of context which the analyst must examine, and ''extent'', the breadth of the utterance which must be changed in order to fix the error. Errors may also be classified according to the level of language: [[phonology|phonological]] errors, [[vocabulary]] or [[lexicon|lexical]] errors, [[syntax|syntactic]] errors, and so on. They may be assessed according to the degree to which they interfere with [[communication]]: ''global'' errors make an utterance difficult to understand, while ''local'' errors do not. In the above example, "I angry" would be a local error, since the meaning is apparent.

From the beginning, error analysis  was beset with [[methodology|methodological]] problems. In particular, the above typologies are problematic: from linguistic data alone, it is often impossible to reliably determine what kind of error a learner is making. Also, error analysis can deal effectively only with learner production ([[Speech communication|speaking]] and [[writing]]) and not with learner reception ([[listening]] and [[reading (activity)|reading]]). Furthermore, it cannot account for learner use of [[communicative strategies]] such as [[avoidance coping|avoidance]], in which learners simply do not use a form with which they are uncomfortable. For these reasons, although error analysis is still used to investigate specific questions in SLA, the quest for an overarching [[theory]] of learner errors has largely been abandoned. In the mid-1970s, Corder and others moved on to a more wide-ranging approach to learner language, known as [[#Interlanguage|interlanguage]].

Error analysis is closely related to the study of [[Error treatment (linguistics)|error treatment in language teaching]]. Today, the study of errors is particularly relevant for [[focus on form]] teaching methodology.

In [[second language acquisition]], '''error analysis''' studies the types and causes of [[speech error|language errors]]. Errors are classified&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bussmann, Hadumod (1996), ''Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics'', London: Routledge, s.v. error analysis. A comprehensive bibliography was published by Bernd Spillner (1991), ''Error Analysis'', Amsterdam/Philadelphia: Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; according to:
* modality (i.e., level of proficiency in speaking, [[writing]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[listening]])
* linguistic levels (i.e., [[pronunciation]], [[grammar]], [[vocabulary]], [[style (fiction)|style]])
* form (e.g., omission, insertion, substitution)
* type (systematic errors/errors in competence vs. occasional errors/errors in performance)
* cause (e.g., [[language transfer|interference]], [[interlanguage]])
* norm vs. system

== Errors Types  ==
Linguists have always been attempting to describe the types of errors committed by the language learners, and that is exactly the best way to start with, as it helps out the applied linguist to identify where the problem lies. According to Dulay et al. (1982) errors take place when the learner change the surface structure in a particularly systematic manner (p.&amp;nbsp;150), thus, the error, no matter what form and type it is, represent a damage at the level of the target language production.

Errors have been classified by J. Richard et al. (2002) into two categories. The Interlingual Error and the Intralingual Error, those two elements refer respectively to the negative influence of both the speaker’s native language, and the target language itself.

Interlingual error is caused by the interference of the native language L1 (also known as interference, linguistic interference, and crosslinguistic influence), whereby the learner tends to use their linguistic knowledge of L1 on some Linguistic features in the target language, however, it often leads to making errors. The example, provided by J. Richard et al. (2002) ‘’ the incorrect French sentence Elle regarde les (“She sees them”), produced according to the word order of English, instead of the correct French sentence Elle les regarde (Literally, “She them sees”). (P. 267) shows the type of errors aroused by the negative effect of the native language interference.

Intralingual error is an error that takes place due to a particular misuse of a particular rule of the target language, it is, in fact, quite the opposite of Interlingual error, it puts the target language into focus, the target language in this perspective is thought of as an error cause. Furthermore, J. Richard, et al. (2002) consider it as one which results from ‘’faulty or partial’’ learning of the target language. (p.267) thus the intralingual error is classified as follow:

'''''Overgenerations:''''' in Linguistic, overgeneralizations error occur when the speaker applies a grammatical rule in cases where it doesn’t apply. Richard et al, (2002) mentioned that they are caused ‘’by extension of target language rules to inappropriate context.’’ (P.185). this kind of errors have been committed while dealing with regular and irregular verbs, as well as the application of plural forms. E.g. (Tooth == Tooths rather than teeth) and (he goes == he goed rather than went).

'''''Simplifications:''''' they are resulting from learners producing simpler linguistic forms than those found in the target language, in other words, learners attempt to be linguistically creative and produce their own poetic sentences/utterances, they may actually be successful in doing it, but it is not necessary the case, Corder (as cited in Mahmoud 2014:276) mentioned that learners do not have the complex system which they could simplify. This kind of errors is committed through both of Omission and addition of some linguistic elements at the level of either the Spelling or grammar. A. Mahmoud (2014) provided examples based on a research conducted on written English of Arabic-speaking second year University students:

# Spelling: omission of silent letters:
#* no (= know) * dout (= doubt) * weit (weight)
# Grammar:
## Omission:
##* We wait ^ the bus all the time.
##* He was ^ clever and has ^ understanding father.
## Addition:
##* Students are do their researches every semester.
##* Both the boys and the girls they can study together.

'''''Developmental Errors:''''' this kind of errors is somehow part of the Overgeneralizations, (this later is subtitled into Natural and developmental learning stage errors), D.E are results of normal pattern of development, such as (come = comed) and (break = breaked), D.E indicates that the learner has started developing their linguistic knowledge and fail to reproduce the rules they have lately been exposed to in target language learning.

'''''Induced errors:''''' as known as Transfer of Training, errors caused by misleading teaching examples, teachers, sometimes, unconditionally, explain a rule without highlighting the exceptions or the intended message they would want to convey. J. Richard et al. (2002) provided an example that occurs at the level of teaching prepositions and particularly ‘’ at ‘’ where the teacher may hold up a box and say ‘’ ''I am looking at the box ‘’,'' the students may understand that ‘’ ''at ‘’'' means ''‘’ under ‘’,'' they may later utter ‘’ the cat is at the table ‘’ instead of the cat is under the table.

'''''Errors of avoidance:''''' these errors occur when the learner fail to apply certain target language rules just because they are thought of to be too difficult.

'''''Errors of overproduction:''''' in the early stages of language learning, learners are supposed to have not yet acquired and accumulated a satisfied linguistic knowledge which can enable them to use the finite rules of the target language in order to produce infinite structures, most of the time, beginners overproduce, in such a way, they frequently repeat a particular structure.

== Error analysis experiments ( Morocco as a case of study )  ==

=== Difficulties of learning English in Morocco ===
As we have mentioned before in our theoretical part that the four basic skills of a language are the speaking/writing/reading/listening, these skills are usually used to test the learning development. Moreover, we decided to make this question for the sake of knowing where the Moroccans’ English learning difficulties at the very beginning of the process lie. However, and for the first time, we gave the participants to cross more than one choice because we were sure that, beginners find difficulties at many levels, and the results were:

The results indicate that 54 participants have encountered difficulties at the level speaking, and 44 found writing skill difficult to develop, and the difficulties at the level of listening were encountered by 33 of the participants, and lastly, 13 goes to the reading skill.&lt;ref name=Morocco_results&gt;https://www.academia.edu/33999467/English_Learning_in_Morocco_Linguistic_Flaws&lt;/ref&gt;

These results enable us to conclude that Moroccans have problems at the level of the production in the process of English Learning, we can apparently notice that speaking/writing are the most frequent problem that a huge number of the participants have had, so that applied linguists along with teachers should innovate new techniques that primarily focus on improving the production of the English Learners in Morocco.

=== The cause of Errors in Morocco ===
The question was thoroughly chosen as it will either approve or deny the approach of Error Analysis in our community, Morocco, however, Error Analysis claims that the causes of the Errors commitment do not only lie in the target language, we tended to ask the participants indirectly about what was the causes of their committing errors, whether it was the L1, L2 or Both and the results were as follow:

The results have shown that 43% of the participants thought that both of the L1 and L2 are the causes of the results of the errors they have made, and after that comes the native language alone as the source of the errors according to the perspective of 37% of the participants, and, lastly, the target language is considered by 20% of them as the only source of errors.&lt;ref name=Morocco_results/&gt;

The results, somehow, go hand in hand with the approach of error analysis, they indicate that the errors analysis approach is actually applicable to the Moroccan Community, thus, while trying to reduce and get rid of the problems predicted through the systematic comparison between L1 and L2, the applied Linguists should also focus on the complexity and the false application of the linguistic elements within and between the target language as well.

=== Preferred Correction time ===
After identifying the error and its cause, the major part, which is correcting it, takes place. However, this question has to do with the error correction time preferred by the learners themselves, whether immediate or delayed ones. The results were as follow:

the results indicate 72% of the participants prefer being corrected immediately corrected, yet only 28% see that delayed ones would be better.&lt;ref name=Morocco_results/&gt;

Immediate corrections can annoy the learners whose personality is not strong enough to perceive corrections as tools which enable them to improve and develop either the accuracy or fluency. However, the fact that Moroccans, through our survey, seemed to prefer immediate corrections which may be thought of as indication of several interpretations. First of all, Moroccans’ personality while learning English is probably strong enough to handle the interruptions. Second of all, Moroccans, maybe, do not feel ashamed of making errors in English, which is actually just the second foreign language in Morocco, and, finally, Moroccans may view that immediate corrections simply more effective than delayed ones.

=== Preferred correction manner ===
This question has to do with the second part of the correction situation which is the correction manner, we tended to know how the participants would like to be corrected and how they would like to fix the errors. However, we provided the participants with three choices; Self-correction correction, peer correction and teacher correction. And the results were as follow:

The results might have been anticipated, 53% of English Learners prefer teacher correction, 26% of them prefer Self-correction, and 21% prefer Peer Corrections.&lt;ref name=Morocco_results/&gt;

These results can only show that students trust more their teacher than both of their classmates and themselves, and since that Self-correction is considered to be the most effective one as we have mentioned in our theoretical part. Consequently, teachers should first teach their students how to properly correct their errors and mistakes, and, in the meanwhile, building up trust between the students. However, all the three kind of corrections should be set together in order to eradicate and get rid of the errors

== Steps ==
According to linguist Corder, the following are the steps in any typical EA research:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ellis | first = Rod | title = The Study of Second Language Acquisition | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=3KglibyrZ5sC&amp;pg=PA48 |year = 1994  | pages = 48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# collecting samples of learner language
# identifying the errors
# describing the errors
# explaining the errors
# evaluating/correcting the errors
collection of errors:
the nature and quantity of errors is likely to vary depending on whether the data consist of natural, spontaneous language use or careful, elicited language use.

Corder (1973) distinguished two kinds of elicitation:''clinical'' and ''experimental'' elicitation.
clinical  elicitation involves getting the informant to produce data of any sort, for example by means of general interview or writing a composition.
experimental elicitation involves the use of special instrument to elicit data containing the linguistic features such as a series of pictures which had been designed to elicit specific features.

'''Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum''' in [[London]], England, is the only library outside [[Belarus]] to collect exclusively in the field of Belarusian studies and its collection is the most comprehensive in this field in [[Western Europe]]. The library is an independent institution owned by a charitable trust.  It is located at 37 Holden Road, [[North Finchley]], London. The library is named after [[Francysk Skaryna]], a Belarusian and East-Slavonic publishing pioneer.

==Collections==
Currently, the book collection is estimated to contain over 30,000 volumes, among them over 20 printed before 1800. The strongest areas of the collection are history, literature, language, religion, folklore, local lore, bibliography, music and art. All standard reference works are available. A collection of expatriate publications, both books and periodicals, is fairly comprehensive. New publications from Belarus are being purchased regularly, as well as all important Belarus-related works appearing abroad in any language. Most of books are in [[Belarusian language]], a fair number in Russian and Polish, fewer in German, French and other languages. The library receives over 40 current periodicals from [[Belarus]] and abroad. The serials collection has over 200 titles; some of them are rare pre-1939 publications. The cartographic collection consists of over 100 maps from the sixteenth century onwards. The collection of [[Belarusian music]] records on LPs is comprehensive; more recent records on cassettes and CDs are collected episodically, with the emphasis on folk, rock and classical music. The archive is extensive; it is the least studied area of the library collection. It contains Church documents of the 18 and 19th centuries, materials dating from the period of the [[Belarusian Democratic Republic]] (1918), archives of Belarusian organisations and personalities in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Baltic and Slavonic libraries in Britain: their place in developing group identity and the life of émigré communities|last=Ivanoŭ|first=Ihar|publisher=Manifold|year=2006|isbn=0901067156|location=London|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of the Library collection began with the establishment of the [[Belarusian Catholic Mission (London)|Belarusian Catholic Mission]] in London in 1947 and its move to Marian House on Holden Avenue in the following year. There, a small (two to three hundred) but valuable collection of Belarusian books brought to England by [[Ceslaus Sipovich|Fr Česlaus Sipovič]] was housed in the southward-facing room on the first floor, immediately above the Mission's chapel. The Library served as a study centre and meeting place for the student associations ''Žyćcio'' and ''Ruń'', and was used by a number of scholars interested in Belarusian heritage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Francis Skaryna Byelorussian Library and Museum (Anglo-Byelorussian Historical papers no.1)|last=|first=|publisher=Anglo-Byelorussian Society|year=1971|isbn=|location=London|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following decade, the book collection increased tenfold and by 1957 was supplemented by subscriptions to all the main periodicals appearing in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|BSSR]] and Belarusian diaspora. In 1958 it received a name ''Bibliotheca Alboruthena''. In the same year, Fr [[Leo Garoshka]] moved from Paris to join the Belarusian Catholic community in London. He brought with him an excellent private library, which included a number of rare books published in western Belarus before the Second World War. This collection was added to the ''Bibliotheca Alboruthena'' making it the largest Belarusian library in western Europe. Frequently, the library was receiving further collections and items from visitors and Belarusians around the world. When in 1960 [[Ceslaus Sipovich|Fr Česlaus Sipovič]] was appointed Bishop and Apostolic Visitor of Belarusians in 1960, he was succeeded by Fr [[Leo Garoshka]] as the ''Bibliotheca Alboruthena''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s librarian. In 1960s, there was made the  first attempt to catalogue the collection.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Francis Skaryna Byelorussian Library and Museum (Anglo-Byelorussian Historical papers no.1)|last=|first=|publisher=Anglo-Byelorussian Society|year=1971|isbn=|location=London|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 the book collection was over 6,500 volumes and growing on the account of developing interest to the Belarusian Studies in British universities. In these circumstances it was decided to purchase a whole building to house the library collection (except the religious books not relevant to the [[Belarusian studies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Francis Skaryna Byelorussian Library and Museum|last=Dingley|first=Jim|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=London|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;), its archive, as well as the small museum housed, since 1967, in the adjusted building of the St Cyril's Belarusian school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The library was formally opened on 15 May 1971. Before that, in January 1971, Fr [[Alexander Nadson]] assumed the role of librarian instead of Fr [[Leo Garoshka]] appointed Director of the Belarusian service of the [[Vatican Radio]]. Initially the library was directed by a Board of Governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Francis Skaryna Byelorussian Library and Museum (Anglo-Byelorussian Historical papers no.1)|last=|first=|publisher=Anglo-Byelorussian Society|year=1971|isbn=|location=London|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the Library was registered as a Charitable Trust governed by a Board of Trustees appointed from among members of the Belarusian Catholic (Fr [[Alexander Nadson]], Fr Felix Žurnia) and Orthodox (Fr J. Piekarski) clergy, representatives of the Belarusian community in Britain (P. Asipovich, J. Dominik, J. Michaluk) and British scholars with a special interest in Belarusian studies ([[Jim Dingley]], [[Arnold McMillin]], [[Guy Picarda]]). Bishop [[Ceslaus Sipovich|Česlaus Sipovič]] remained its Chair until his death in 1981; he was succeeded by Fr [[Alexander Nadson]]. [[Peter J. Mayo|Peter Mayo]] was appointed a Trustee to succeed Fr Žurnia who died in 1982.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Francis Skaryna Byelorussian Library and Museum|last=Dingley|first=Jim|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=London|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution was conceived as a reference library for supporting Belarus-related research; its chief aim was defined as "to collect all material, both in printed and manuscript forms, relating to Byelorussia, and to make it accessible to all those interested in any aspect of Byelorussian studies".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By 1991, it acquired over 12,000 titles with an annual increase of 300-400. It was receiving practically all Belarusian publications, as well as those relating to Belarus, which appeared in [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|BSSR]], [[Poland]] and the West. In 1990, the Library established an exchange agreement with the [[National Academy of Sciences of Belarus|Belarusian Academy of Sciences]] Library, Minsk, which allowed it to receive duplicate copies of publications of the 1920s and 1930s - otherwise unobtainable - in exchange for expensive scholar publications from the West.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Its holdings were also enriched considerably by systematic search for old and out-of-print publications and by numerous gifts and bequests from various benefactors. Most books were in Belarusian, but with a considerable number of works in other languages, in particular Polish and Russian. An extensive collection of microfilms and microfiche was also acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Francis Skaryna Byelorussian Library and Museum|last=Dingley|first=Jim|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=London|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the large part of 1990s and 2000s, Prof Adam Maldzis (Minsk) singlehandedly supplied the Library with books and periodicals appearing in Belarus.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivanou|first=Ihar|date=2015|title=Belarusians in the UK: library as a soft-power tool|url=http://www.skaryna.org.uk/library-as-a-soft-power-tool/|journal=Belarusian Review|volume=27|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the period of booming publishing in Belarus; eventually, it became impossible to collect all Belarus-related publications appearing worldwide.

The library has organised several international seminars and conferences in Belarusian studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Гардзіенка|first1=Наталля|title=Беларусы ў Вялікабрытаніі|date=2010|publisher=Медысонт|location=Мінск|isbn=978-985-6887-63-8|pages=438–441|url=http://kamunikat.org/usie_knihi.html?pubid=14870|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the health of Fr Alexander Nadson, the long-standing head of the Board of Trustees and primary keeper of the institution, started deteriorating, the Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum entered the period of decline.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It was removed from the list of charitable organisations in 2011 for the lack of activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/RemovedCharityMain.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=278442|title=278442 - The Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Charity Commission|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Board of Trustees reconvened to revive the institution and ensure its future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.svaboda.org/content/article/26998244.html|title=Пасьля Надсана|last=Шупа|first=Сяргей|date=2015-05-06|website=Радыё Свабода|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mission Statement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skaryna.org.uk/about/mission-statement/|title=Mission Statement|last=|first=|date=2015-07-26|website=Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Aims&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skaryna.org.uk/about/aims/|title=Aims|last=|first=|date=2015-06-26|website=Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; were adopted revising, for the first time since 1971, the initial aims of the institution: in addition to collecting and preservation of the Belarusian cultural heritage, and supporting the Belarusian studies - to contribute to the life of the Belarusian community in Britain and encourage interest in Belarus among the British public. In 2015, as a confirmation of its revival and important place in the life of the British society, the institution received a new charity registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1161434|title=1161434 - THE FRANCIS SKARYNA BELARUSIAN LIBRARY AND MUSEUM|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Charity Commission|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, it began a programme of digitisation of its most valuable and rare items, series of events and collaborative working with other institutions in Belarus and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skaryna.org.uk/trustees-annual-report-for-2015/|title=Trustees’ Annual Report for 2015|last=|first=|date=2016-03-07|website=Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2016, the [[Church of St Cyril of Turau and All the Patron Saints of the Belarusian People]] has been built next to the Francis Skaryna Library.

'''GLONASS''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|ГЛОНАСС}}, {{IPA-ru|ɡɫɐˈnas|IPA}}; {{lang|ru|Глобальная навигационная спутниковая система}}; transliteration ''{{transl|ru|Globalnaya navigatsionnaya sputnikovaya sistema}}''), or "Global Navigation Satellite System", is a space-based [[satellite navigation system]] operating in the [[radionavigation-satellite service]]. It provides an alternative to [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and is the second navigational system in operation with global coverage and of comparable precision.

Manufacturers of [[GPS navigation device]]s say that adding GLONASS made more satellites available to them, meaning positions can be fixed more quickly and accurately, especially in built-up areas where the view to some GPS satellites may be obscured by buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3355462 | pmid=22666079 | doi=10.3390/s120405134 | volume=12 | title=Benefits of combined GPS/GLONASS with low-cost MEMS IMUs for vehicular urban navigation | year=2012 | journal=Sensors (Basel) | pages=5134–58 | last1 = Angrisano | first1 = A | last2 = Petovello | first2 = M | last3 = Pugliano | first3 = G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxts.com/glonass-significantly-benefits-gps/|title=GLONASS significantly benefits GPS - OxTS|date=15 September 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.sonymobile.com/2012/01/19/glonass-support-in-our-latest-xperia-phones/|title=Developer Tools - Sony Developer World|website=developer.sonymobile.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also more suitable for use in high latitudes (north or south).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS, GLonaSS, and More|url=http://www2.unb.ca/gge/Resources/gpsworld.june10.pdf|publisher=University of New Brunswick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of GLONASS began in the Soviet Union in 1976. Beginning on 12 October 1982, numerous rocket launches added satellites to the system until the [[Satellite constellation|constellation]] was completed in 1995. After a decline in capacity during the late 1990s, in 2001, under [[Vladimir Putin]]'s presidency, the restoration of the system was made a top government priority and funding was substantially increased. GLONASS is the most expensive program of the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]], consuming a third of its budget in 2010.

By 2010, GLONASS had achieved 100% coverage of [[Geography of Russia|Russia's territory]] and in October 2011, the full orbital constellation of 24 satellites was restored, enabling full global coverage. The GLONASS satellites' designs have undergone several upgrades, with the latest version being [[GLONASS-K2]], scheduled to enter service in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sworld.com.au/steven/space/russia-man.txt |title=Russian launch manifest |first=Steven |last=Pietrobon |date=18 June 2018 |access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2040 a group of communications and navigational satellite is announced to be deployed. The task also includes the delivery to the Moon of a series of spacecraft for orbital research and the establishment of a global communications and positioning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/science/201811301070263324-russia-glonassmoon-orbit-deployment/|title=Russia to Deploy Glonass-Type Satellites in Lunar Orbit by 2040|last=Sputnik|website=sputniknews.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Comparison satellite navigation orbits}}

GLONASS is a global satellite navigation system, providing real time position and velocity determination for  military and civilian users. The satellites are located in middle circular orbit at {{convert|19100|km}} altitude with a 64.8 degree inclination and a period of 11 hours and 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="ato_glonass"/&gt;&lt;ref name="federal_targeted_program_2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA484380|title=The Global Navigation System GLONASS: Development and Usage in the 21st Century|publisher=34th Annual Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) Meeting|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLONASS' orbit makes it especially suited for usage in high latitudes (north or south), where getting a [[GPS]] signal can be problematic.&lt;ref name="harvey_military"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moskvitch"/&gt; The constellation operates in three orbital planes, with eight evenly spaced satellites on each.&lt;ref name="federal_targeted_program_2002"/&gt; A fully operational constellation with global coverage consists of 24 satellites, while 18 satellites are necessary for covering the territory of Russia. To get a position fix the receiver must be in the range of at least four satellites.&lt;ref name="ato_glonass"/&gt;

=== Signal ===
{{anchor|Signals}}

==== FDMA ====
[[File:Glonass-receiver.jpg|thumb|One of first samples Russian military rugged, combined GLONASS/GPS receiver, 2003 yr]]

GLONASS satellites transmit two types of signal: open standard-precision signal L1OF/L2OF, and [[obfuscated]] high-precision signal L1SF/L2SF.

The signals use similar [[Direct sequence spread spectrum|DSSS]] encoding and [[binary phase-shift keying]] (BPSK) modulation as in GPS signals. All GLONASS satellites transmit the same code as their standard-precision signal; however each transmits on a different frequency using a 15-channel [[frequency division multiple access]] (FDMA) technique spanning either side from 1602.0 [[MHz]], known as the L1 band. The center frequency is 1602&amp;nbsp;MHz + ''n'' × 0.5625&amp;nbsp;MHz, where ''n'' is a satellite's frequency channel number (''n''=−7,−6,−5,...0,...,6, previously ''n''=0,...,13). Signals are transmitted in a 38° cone, using right-hand [[circular polarization]], at an [[Equivalent isotropically radiated power|EIRP]] between 25 and 27 [[dBW]] (316 to 500 watts).  Note that the 24-satellite constellation is accommodated with only 15 channels by using identical frequency channels to support [[antipodal point|antipodal]] (opposite side of planet in orbit) satellite pairs, as these satellites are never both in view of an earth-based user at the same time.

The L2 band signals use the same FDMA as the L1 band signals, but transmit straddling 1246&amp;nbsp;MHz with the center frequency 1246&amp;nbsp;MHz + ''n''×0.4375&amp;nbsp;MHz, where ''n'' spans the same range as for L1.&lt;ref name="glonass_xmtr"&gt;GLONASS transmitter specs&lt;/ref&gt; In the original GLONASS design, only obfuscated high-precision signal was broadcast in the L2 band, but starting with GLONASS-M, an additional civil reference signal L2OF is broadcast with an identical standard-precision code to the L1OF signal.

[[File:GLONASS GPS Personal Radio Beacon.jpg|thumb|A combined GLONASS/GPS Personal Radio Beacon]]

The open standard-precision signal is generated with [[Exclusive or|modulo-2 addition]] (XOR) of 511 kbit/s pseudo-random ranging code, 50 bit/s navigation message, and an auxiliary 100&amp;nbsp;Hz [[Meander (mathematics)|meander]] sequence ([[Manchester code]]), all generated using a single time/frequency oscillator. The pseudo-random code is generated with a 9-stage shift register operating with a period of 1 ms.

The navigational message is modulated at 50 bits per second. The superframe of the open signal is 7500 bits long and consists of 5 frames of 30 seconds, taking 150 seconds (2.5 minutes) to transmit the continuous message. Each frame is 1500 bits long and consists of 15 strings of 100 bits (2 seconds for each string), with 85 bits (1.7 seconds) for data and check-sum bits, and 15 bits (0.3 seconds) for time mark. Strings 1-4 provide immediate data for the transmitting satellite, and are repeated every frame; the data include ephemeris, clock and frequency offsets, and satellite status. Strings 5-15 provide non-immediate data (i.e. almanac) for each satellite in the constellation, with frames I-IV each describing five satellites, and frame V describing remaining four satellites.

The ephemerides are updated every 30 minutes using data from the Ground Control segment; they use [[ECEF|Earth Centred Earth Fixed]] (ECEF) Cartesian coordinates in position and velocity, and include lunisolar acceleration parameters. The almanac uses modified Keplerian parameters and is updated daily.

The more accurate high-precision signal is available for authorized users, such as the Russian military, yet unlike the US P(Y) code, which is modulated by an encrypting W code, the GLONASS restricted-use codes are broadcast in the clear using only ''[[security through obscurity]]''. The details of the high-precision signal have not been disclosed. The modulation (and therefore the tracking strategy) of the data bits on the L2SF code has recently changed from unmodulated to 250 bit/s burst at random intervals. The L1SF code is modulated by the navigation data at 50 bit/s without a Manchester meander code.

The high-precision signal is broadcast in phase quadrature with the standard-precision signal, effectively sharing the same carrier wave, but with a ten-times-higher bandwidth than the open signal.  The message format of the high-precision signal remains unpublished, although attempts at reverse-engineering indicate that the superframe is composed of 72 frames, each containing 5 strings of 100 bits and taking 10 seconds to transmit, with total length of 36 000 bits or 720 seconds (12 minutes) for the whole navigational message. The additional data are seemingly allocated to critical Luni-Solar acceleration parameters and clock correction terms.

===== Accuracy =====
At peak efficiency, the standard-precision signal offers horizontal positioning accuracy within 5–10 meters, vertical positioning within {{convert|15|m}}, a velocity vector measuring within {{convert|10|cm/s}}, and timing within 200 ns, all based on measurements from four first-generation satellites simultaneously;&lt;ref name="miller_2000"&gt;"A Review of GLONASS" Miller, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; newer satellites such as GLONASS-M improve on this.

GLONASS uses a coordinate [[geodetic datum|datum]] named "[[PZ-90]]" (Earth Parameters 1990 – Parametry Zemli 1990), in which the precise location of the [[North Pole]] is given as an average of its position from 1990 to 1995. This is in contrast to the GPS's coordinate datum, [[WGS 84]], which uses the location of the North Pole in 1984. As of 17 September 2007 the PZ-90 datum has been updated to version PZ-90.02 which differ from WGS 84 by less than {{convert|40|cm|0|abbr=on}} in any given direction. Since 31 December 2013, version PZ-90.11 is being broadcast, which is aligned to the [[International Terrestrial Reference System]] at epoch 2011.0 at the centimeter level.&lt;ref name=icg8&gt;[http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/pdf/icg/2013/icg-8/wgD/D3_3_2.pdf National Reference Systems of the Russian Federation used in GLONASS.] V.

The interface control documents for GLONASS CDMA signals was published in August 2016.&lt;ref name=glonass_icd&gt;[http://russianspacesystems.ru/bussines/navigation/glonass/interfeysnyy-kontrolnyy-dokument/ Russian Space Systems JSC - GLONASS Interface Control Documents] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to GLONASS developers, there will be three open and two restricted CDMA signals. The open signal L3OC is centered at 1202.025&amp;nbsp;MHz and uses BPSK(10) modulation for both data and pilot channels; the ranging code transmits at 10.23 million [[Chip (CDMA)|chips]] per second, modulated onto the carrier frequency using QPSK with in-phase data and quadrature pilot. The data is error-coded with 5-bit [[Barker code]] and the pilot with 10-bit [[Neuman-Hoffman code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpsworld.com/glonass-modernization-12232/|title=GLONASS Modernization|work=GPS World|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidegnss.com/auto/julyaug11-Dumas.pdf |title=Data |date=2011 |website=www.insidegnss.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open L1OC and restricted L1SC signals are centered at 1600.995&amp;nbsp;MHz, and open L2OC and restricted L2SC signals are centered at 1248.06&amp;nbsp;MHz, overlapping with GLONASS FDMA signals. Open signals L1OC and L2OC use [[time-division multiplexing]] to transmit pilot and data signals, with BPSK(1) modulation for data and BOC(1,1) modulation for pilot; wide-band restricted signals L1SC and L2SC use BOC (5, 2.5) modulation for both data and pilot, transmitted in quadrature phase to the open signals; this places peak signal strength away from the center frequency of narrow-band open signals.&lt;ref name=CDMA_2012_ICG/&gt;&lt;ref name=GPSWorld_Nov_2011&gt;[http://www.gpsworld.com/glonass-modernization-12232/ GLONASS Modernization] Yuri Urlichich, Valery Subbotin, Grigory Stupak, Vyacheslav Dvorkin, Alexander Povalyaev, Sergey Karutin, and Rudolf Bakitko, Russian Space Systems. GPS World, November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Binary phase-shift keying]] (BPSK) is used by standard GPS and GLONASS signals, however both BPSK and [[quadrature phase-shift keying]] (QPSK) can be considered as variations of [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] (QAM), specifically QAM-2 and QAM-4. [[Binary offset carrier]] (BOC) is the modulation used by [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], [[modernized GPS]], and [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou-2]].

The navigational message of CDMA signals is transmitted as a sequence of text strings. The message has variable size - each pseudo-frame usually includes six strings and contains [[ephemerides]] for the current satellite (string types 10, 11, and 12 in a sequence) and part of the almanac for three satellites (three strings of type 20). To transmit the full almanac for all current 24 satellites, a superframe of 8 pseudo-frames is required. In the future, the superframe will be expanded to 10 pseudo-frames of data to cover full 30 satellites. The message can also contain [[Earth rotation]] parameters, ionosphere models, long-term orbit parameters for GLONASS satellites, and COSPAS-SARSAT messages. The system time marker is transmitted with each string; [[UTC leap second]] correction is achieved by shortening or lengthening (zero-padding) the final string of the day by one second, with abnormal strings being discarded by the receiver.&lt;ref name=GPSWorld_Apr_2011&gt;[http://www.gpsworld.com/innovation-glonass-11405/ GLONASS: Developing Strategies for the Future]. Yuri Urlichich, Valeriy Subbotin, Grigory Stupak, Vyacheslav Dvorkin, Alexander Povalyaev, and Sergey Karutin. GPS World, November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The strings have a version tag to facilitate [[forward compatibility]]: future upgrades to the message format will not break older equipment, which will continue to work by ignoring new data (as long as the constellation still transmits old string types), but up-to-date equipment will be able to use additional information from newer satellites.&lt;ref name=GPSWorld_Nov_2013&gt;[http://gpsworld.com/new-structure-for-glonass-nav-message/ New Structure for GLONASS Nav Message] Alexander Povalyaev.

The navigational message of the L3OC signal is transmitted at 100 bit/s, with each string of symbols taking 3 seconds (300 bits). A pseudo-frame of 6 strings takes 18 seconds (1800 bits) to transmit. A superframe of 8 pseudo-frames is 14,400 bits long and takes 144 seconds (2 minutes 24 seconds) to transmit the full almanac.

The navigational message of the L1OC signal is transmitted at 100 bit/s. The string is 250 bits long and takes 2.5 seconds to transmit. A pseudo-frame is 1500 bits (15 seconds) long, and a superframe is 12,000 bits or 120 seconds (2 minutes).

L2OC signal does not transmit any navigational message, only the pseudo-range codes.

Glonass-K1 test satellite launched in 2011 introduced L3OC signal. Glonass-M satellites produced since 2014 (s/n 755+) will also transmit L3OC signal for testing purposes.

Enhanced Glonass-K1 and Glonass-K2 satellites, to be launched from 2018, will feature a full suite of modernized CDMA signals in the existing L1 and L2 bands, which includes L1SC, L1OC, L2SC, and L2OC, as well as the L3OC signal. Glonass-K series should gradually replace existing satellites starting from 2018, when Glonass-M launches will cease.&lt;ref name="ICG_2016"&gt;[http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/icg/2016/icg11/01.pdf GLONASS Program Update].

Glonass-KM satellites will be launched by 2025. Additional open signals are being studied for these satellites, based on frequencies and formats used by existing GPS, Galileo, and Beidou/COMPASS signals:

* open signal L1OCM using BOC(1,1) modulation centered at 1575.42&amp;nbsp;MHz, similar to [[L1C|modernized GPS signal L1C]], Galileo signal E1, and Beidou/COMPASS signal B1C;

== Satellites ==
{{See also|List of GLONASS satellites}}
The main contractor of the GLONASS program is Joint Stock Company [[Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems]] (ISS Reshetnev, formerly called NPO-PM). The company, located in [[Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Zheleznogorsk]], is the designer of all GLONASS satellites, in cooperation with the Institute for Space Device Engineering ([[:ru:РНИИ КП]]) and the Russian Institute of Radio Navigation and Time. Serial production of the satellites is accomplished by the company [[PC Polyot]] in [[Omsk]].

Over the three decades of development, the satellite designs have gone through numerous improvements, and can be divided into three generations: the original GLONASS (since 1982), GLONASS-M (since 2003) and GLONASS-K (since 2011). Each GLONASS satellite has a [[GRAU]] designation 11F654, and each of them also has the military "Cosmos-NNNN" designation.&lt;ref&gt;''Uragan'', Russian Space Web&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First generation ===
{{main article|GLONASS (satellite)}}
The true first generation of GLONASS (also called Uragan) satellites were all three-axis stabilized vehicles, generally weighing {{convert|1250|kg}} and were equipped with a modest propulsion system to permit relocation within the constellation. Over time they were upgraded to Block IIa, IIb, and IIv vehicles, with each block containing evolutionary improvements.

Six Block IIa satellites were launched in 1985–1986 with improved time and frequency standards over the prototypes, and increased frequency stability. These spacecraft also demonstrated a 16-month average operational lifetime. Block IIb spacecraft, with a two-year design lifetimes, appeared in 1987, of which a total of 12 were launched, but half were lost in launch vehicle accidents. The six spacecraft that made it to orbit worked well, operating for an average of nearly 22 months.

Block IIv was the most prolific of the first generation. Used exclusively from 1988 to 2000, and continued to be included in launches through 2005, a total of 56 satellites were launched. The design life was three years, however numerous spacecraft exceeded this, with one late model lasting 68 months, nearly double.&lt;ref&gt;GLONASS #787, 68.7 operational months; as reported by RSA "GLONASS constellation status" on 6 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Block II satellites were typically launched three at a time from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] using [[Proton-K]] Blok-DM-2 or Proton-K Briz-M boosters. The only exception was when, on two launches, an [[Etalon (satellite)|Etalon]] geodetic reflector satellite was substituted for a GLONASS satellite.

=== Second generation ===
{{main article|GLONASS-M}}
The second generation of satellites, known as Glonass-M, were developed beginning in 1990 and first launched in 2003. These satellites possess a substantially increased lifetime of seven years and weigh slightly more at {{convert|1480|kg}}. They are approximately {{convert|2.4|m|0|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|3.7|m|0|abbr=on}} high, with a solar array span of {{convert|7.2|m|0|abbr=on}} for an electrical power generation capability of 1600 watts at launch. The aft payload structure houses 12 primary antennas for L-band transmissions. Laser corner-cube reflectors are also carried to aid in precise orbit determination and geodetic research. On-board [[Caesium standard|cesium clocks]] provide the local clock source. Glonass-M includes 31 satellites ranging from satellite index 21 - 92 and with 4 spare active satellites.

A total of 41 second generation satellites were launched through the end of 2013. As with the previous generation, the second generation spacecraft were launched three at a time using [[Proton rocket|Proton-K]] Blok-DM-2 or Proton-K Briz-M boosters.  Some where launched alone with [[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz-2-1b]]/[[Fregat]]

On July 30, 2015, [[Information Satellite Systems Reshetnev|ISS Reshetnev]] announced that it had completed the last GLONASS-M (No. 61) spacecraft and it was putting it in storage waiting for launch, along with eight previously built satellites.&lt;ref name="issr-20150730" /&gt;&lt;ref name="itartass-811771" /&gt;

As on September 22, 2017, GLONASS-M No. 52 satellite went into operation and the orbital grouping has again increased to 24 space vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/news/russia-increases-glonass-orbital-grouping-24-satellites/|title=Russia increases GLONASS orbital grouping to 24 satellites - Geospatial World|date=2017-10-23|work=Geospatial World|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third generation ===
{{main article|GLONASS-K}}
GLONASS-K is a substantial improvement of the previous generation: it is the first unpressurised GLONASS satellite with a much reduced mass ({{convert|750|kg}} versus {{convert|1450|kg}} of GLONASS-M). It has an operational lifetime of 10 years, compared to the 7-year lifetime of the second generation GLONASS-M. It will transmit more navigation signals to improve the system's accuracy—including new CDMA signals in the L3 and L5 bands, which will use modulation similar to modernized GPS, Galileo, and Compass. Glonass-K consist of 26 satellites having satellite index 65-98 and widely used in Russian Military space.&lt;ref name="reshetnev_glonass_history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rian_scheduled"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20110209/162520205.html|title=Russia to launch Glonass satellite on Feb. 24|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BPW/is_10_21/ai_n56309362/?tag=content;col1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711083220/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BPW/is_10_21/ai_n56309362/?tag=content;col1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-11 |work=GPS World |first=Richard |last=Langley |title=GLONASS forecast bright and plentiful |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new satellite's advanced equipment—made solely from Russian components—will allow the doubling of GLONASS' accuracy.&lt;ref name="ato_glonass"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ato.ru/content/glonass-nearing-completion |title=Glonass nearing completion |journal=Russia &amp; CIS Observer |last=Afanasyev |first=Igor |author2=Dmitri Vorontsov |date=2010-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wgZX1j2m?url=http://www.ato.ru/content/glonass-nearing-completion |archivedate=22 February 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the previous satellites, these are 3-axis stabilized, [[nadir]] pointing with dual solar arrays.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The first GLONASS-K satellite was successfully launched on 26 February 2011.&lt;ref name="reshetnev_glonass_history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/images/File/magazin/2007/m2-screen_en.pdf |title=Glonass-K: a prospective satellite of the GLONASS system |publisher=Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713063606/http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/images/File/magazin/2007/m2-screen_en.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_russia_launches_satellite"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12587238|title=Russia launches satellite for global navigation system|publisher=BBC News|date=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their weight reduction, GLONASS-K spacecraft can be launched in pairs from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] launch site using the substantially lower cost [[Soyuz-2.1b]] boosters or in six-at-once from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] using Proton-K Briz-M launch vehicles.&lt;ref name="ato_glonass"/&gt;&lt;ref name="federal_targeted_program_2002"/&gt;

The system requires 18 satellites for continuous navigation services covering the entire territory of the Russian Federation, and 24 satellites to provide services worldwide.&lt;ref name="rianovosti_worldrecord"&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081229/119210306.html Russia to set world record with 39 space launches in 2009] RIA Novosti 2008-12-29&lt;/ref&gt; The GLONASS system covers 100% of worldwide territory.

On 2 April 2014 the system experienced a technical failure that resulted in practical unavailability of the navigation signal for around 12 hours.&lt;ref name="izvestia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/568647 |title=Роскосмос ищет причины сбоя ГЛОНАСС |publisher=Izvestia |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14–15 April 2014 nine GLONASS satellites experienced a technical failure due to software problems.&lt;ref name="novaya gazeta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/1680872.html |title=Система ГЛОНАСС вышла из строя втоher=Novaya Gazeta |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 2016 three GLONASS satellites experienced a technical failure: the batteries of GLONASS-738 exploded, the batteries of GLONASS-737 were depleted, and GLONASS-736 experienced a stationkeeping failure due to human error during maneuvering. GLONASS-737 and GLONASS-736 are expected to be operational again after maintenance, and one new satellite (GLONASS-751) to replace GLONASS-738 is expected to complete commissioning in early March. The full capacity of the satellite group is expected to be restored in the middle of March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/604492|title=Роскосмос обещает восстановить ГЛОНАСС к середине марта|date=18 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the launching of two new satellites and maintenance of two others, the full capacity of the satellite group was restored.

=== Accuracy ===
The GLONASS accuracy is up to 2.8 meters, in comparison with GPS, which have accuracy up to 5 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.gps.gov/technical/ps/2008-SPS-performance-standard.pdf|title=SPS Performance Standard|publisher=GPS.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;


According to Russian System of Differentional Correction and Monitoring's data, {{as of|2010|lc=on}}, precision of GLONASS navigation definitions (for p=0.95) for latitude and longitude were {{convert|4.46|–|7.38|m}} with mean number of navigation space vehicles (NSV) equals 7—8 (depending on station). In comparison, the same time precision of GPS [[navigation]] definitions were {{convert|2.00|–|8.76|m}} with mean number of NSV equals 6—11 (depending on station). Civilian GLONASS used alone is therefore very slightly less accurate than [[GPS]]. On high latitudes (north or south), GLONASS' accuracy is better than that of GPS due to the orbital position of the satellites.&lt;ref name="mt_swepos"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/first-foreign-firm-embraces-glonass/434850.html|title=First Foreign Firm Embraces Glonass|publisher=The Moscow Times|date=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern receivers are able to use both GLONASS and GPS satellites together, providing greatly improved coverage in urban canyons and giving a very fast time to fix due to over 50 satellites being available. In indoor, urban canyon or mountainous areas, accuracy can be greatly improved over using GPS alone. For using both navigation systems simultaneously, precision of GLONASS/GPS navigation definitions were {{convert|2.37|–|4.65|m}} with mean number of NSV equals 14—19 (depends on station).

In May 2009, [[Anatoly Perminov]], then director of the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]], stated that actions were undertaken to expand GLONASS's constellation and to improve the [[ground segment]] to increase the  navigation definition of GLONASS to an accuracy of {{convert|2.8|m}} by 2011.&lt;ref name="pr_rianscience"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rian.ru/science/20090512/170848130.html|title=Роскосмос обещает повысить точность работы ГЛОНАСС с 10 до 5,5 метров|work=РИА Новости|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the latest satellite design, [[GLONASS-K]] has the ability to double the system's accuracy once introduced. The system's ground segment is also to undergo improvements. As of early 2012, sixteen positioning ground stations are under construction in Russia and in the Antarctic at the [[Bellingshausen Station|Bellingshausen]] and [[Novolazarevskaya Station|Novolazarevskaya]] bases. New stations will be built around the southern hemisphere from Brazil to Indonesia. Together, these improvements are expected to bring GLONASS' accuracy to 0.6&amp;nbsp;m or better by 2020.&lt;ref name="kramnik_feb2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2012/02/16/glonass_benefits_worth_the_extra_expense_14862.html|title=GLONASS benefits worth the extra expense|last1=Kramnik|first1=Ilya|publisher=Russia Beyond the Headlines|date=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setup of a GLONASS receiving station in the [[Philippines]] is also now under negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DOST Finalizes MOU with Russian Space Agency|url=https://www.dfa.gov.ph/dfa-news/news-from-our-foreign-service-postsupdate/17790-dost-finalizes-mou-with-russian-space-agency|accessdate=24 September 2018|publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)]]|date=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stamp-russia2016-glonass.png|thumb|right|Russian 2016 stamp with a GLONASS satellite.]]

=== Inception and design ===
[[File:Glonass.gif|thumb|A GLONASS satellite]]
The first satellite-based radio [[navigation system]] developed in the Soviet Union was [[Tsiklon (satellite navigation system)|Tsiklon]], which had the purpose of providing [[ballistic missile submarine]]s a method for accurate positioning. 31 Tsiklon satellites were launched between 1967 and 1978. The main problem with the system was that, although highly accurate for stationary or slow-moving ships, it required several hours of observation by the receiving station to fix a position, making it unusable for many navigation purposes and for the guidance of the new generation of ballistic missiles.&lt;ref name="astronautix_tsiklon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/tsiklon.htm|title=Tsiklon|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628182723/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/tsiklon.htm|archivedate=28 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968–1969, a new navigation system, which would support not only the navy, but also the air, land and space forces, was conceived. Formal requirements were completed in 1970; in 1976, the government made a decision to launch development of the "Unified Space Navigation System GLONASS".&lt;ref name="astronautix_glonass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/glonass.htm|title=Glonass|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129132654/http://astronautix.com/craft/glonass.htm|archivedate=29 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The task of designing GLONASS was given to a group of young specialists at [[JSC Information Satellite Systems|NPO PM]] in the city of [[Krasnoyarsk-26]] (today called [[Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Zheleznogorsk]]). Under the leadership of [[Vladimir Cheremisin]], they developed different proposals, from which the institute's director [[Grigory Chernyavsky]] selected the final one. The work was completed in the late 1970s; the system consists of 24 satellites operating at an altitude of {{convert|20000|km}} in medium circular orbit. It would be able to promptly fix the receiving station's position based on signals from four satellites, and also reveal the object's speed and direction. The satellites would be launched three at a time on the heavy-lift [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]] rocket. Due to the large number of satellites needed for the program, NPO PM delegated the manufacturing of the satellites to [[PO Polyot]] in [[Omsk]], which had better production capabilities.&lt;ref name="iss_glonass_history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/images/File/magazin/2007/m2-screen_en.pdf |title=Start of GLONASS |publisher=ISS Reshetnev |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713063606/http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/images/File/magazin/2007/m2-screen_en.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iss_magazine8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/images/File/magazin/2009/m8-screen_en.pdf |title=Satellite Navigation of the 21st Century |publisher=ISS Reshetnev |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121215653/http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/images/File/magazin/2009/m8-screen_en.pdf |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, GLONASS was designed to have an accuracy of {{convert|65|m}}, but in reality it had an accuracy of {{convert|20|m}} in the civilian signal and {{convert|10|m}} in the military signal.&lt;ref name="harvey_military"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Brian|title=The Rebirth of the Russian Space Program|publisher=Springer|location=Germany|year=2007|edition=1st|chapter=Military programs|isbn=978-0-387-71354-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GLONASS (satellite)|first generation]] GLONASS satellites were {{convert|7.8|m}} tall, had a width of {{convert|7.2|m}}, measured across their solar panels, and a mass of {{convert|1260|kg}}.&lt;ref name="harvey_military"/&gt;

=== Achieving full orbital constellation ===
In the early 1980s, [[NPO PM]] received the first prototype satellites from [[PO Polyot]] for ground tests. Many of the produced parts were of low quality and NPO PM engineers had to perform substantial redesigning, leading to a delay.&lt;ref name="iss_glonass_history"/&gt; On 12 October 1982, three satellites, designated [[Kosmos-1413]], [[Kosmos-1414]], and [[Kosmos-1415]] were launched aboard a [[Proton (rocket)|Proton rocket]]. As only one GLONASS satellite was ready in time for the launch instead of the expected three, it was decided to launch it along with two mock-ups. The USA media reported the event as a launch of one satellite and "two secret objects." For a long time, the USA could not find out the nature of those "objects". The [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS) covered the launch, describing GLONASS as a system "created to determine positioning of civil aviation aircraft, navy transport and fishing-boats of the Soviet Union".&lt;ref name="iss_glonass_history"/&gt;

From 1982 to April 1991, the Soviet Union successfully launched a total of 43 GLONASS-related satellites plus five test satellites. When the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union disintegrated]] in 1991, twelve GLONASS satellites in two planes were operational; enough to allow limited use of the system (to cover the entire territory of the Union, 18 satellites would have been necessary.) The Russian Federation took over control of the constellation and continued its development.&lt;ref name="iss_magazine8"/&gt; In 1993, the system, now consisting of 12 satellites, was formally declared operational&lt;ref name="rian_made_available"/&gt; and in December 1995 it was brought to a fully operational constellation of 24 satellites. This brought the precision of GLONASS on a par with the USA [[GPS]] system, which had achieved full operation а year earlier.&lt;ref name="iss_magazine8"/&gt;

=== Economic crisis ===
Since the first generation satellites operated for three years each, to keep the system at full capacity, two launches per year would have been necessary to maintain the full network of 24 satellites. However, in the financially difficult period of 1989–1999, the space program's funding was cut by 80% and Russia consequently found itself unable to afford this launch rate. After the full complement was achieved in  December 1995, there were no further launches until December 1999. As a result, the constellation reached its lowest point of just six operational satellites in 2001. As a prelude to demilitarisation, responsibility of the program was transferred from the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defence]] to Russia's civilian space agency [[Roscosmos]].&lt;ref name="harvey_military"/&gt;

=== Renewed efforts and modernization ===
[[File:Putin Glonass navigator.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Vladimir Putin]] with a GLONASS car navigation device. As President, Putin paid special attention to the development of GLONASS.]]
In the 2000s, the Russian economy recovered and state finances improved considerably.  [[Vladimir Putin]] took a special interest in GLONASS&lt;ref name="harvey_military"/&gt; and the system's restoration was made one of the government's top priorities.&lt;ref name="moskvitch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8595704.stm|title=Glonass: Has Russia's sat-nav system come of age?|publisher=BBC News|date=2010-04-02|first=Katia|last=Moskvitch}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose, on August 2001, the Federal Targeted Program "Global Navigation System" 2002–2011 (Government Decision No. 587) was launched. The program was given a budget of $420 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/sci-tech/glonass-wants-system-gps/ Glonass still wants to be "the other guy in the sky] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213050452/http://rt.com/news/sci-tech/glonass-wants-system-gps/ |date=13 February 2011 }}. RT. 6 December 2010. Retrieved on 2011-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; and aimed at restoring the full constellation by 2009.

On 10 December 2003, the second generation satellite design, [[GLONASS-M]], was launched for the first time. It had a slightly larger mass than the baseline GLONASS, standing at {{convert|1415|kg}}, but it had seven years lifetime, four years longer than the lifetime of the original GLONASS satellite, decreasing the required replacement rate. The new satellite also had better accuracy and ability to broadcast two extra civilian signals.

In 2006, Defence Minister [[Sergei Ivanov|Sergey Ivanov]] ordered one of the signals (with an accuracy of {{convert|30|m}}) to be made available to civilian users. Putin, however, was not satisfied with this, and demanded that the whole system should be made fully available to everyone. Consequently, on 18 May 2007, all restrictions were lifted.&lt;ref name="rian_made_available"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rian_2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20061113/55588641.html|title=Russia to lift Glonass restrictions for accurate civilian use|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2006-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accurate, formerly military-only signal with a precision of {{convert|10|m}}, has since then been freely available to civilian users.

During the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, the Russian economy boomed, resulting in substantial increases in the country's space budget. In 2007, the financing of the GLONASS program was increased considerably; its budget was more than doubled. While in 2006 the GLONASS had received $181 million from the federal budget, in 2007 the amount was increased to $380 million.&lt;ref name="rian_made_available"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/science/20070518/65725503.html|title=Putin makes Glonass navigation system free for customers – 1|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, 140.1 billion rubles ($4.7 billion) were spent on the program 2001–2011, making it Roscosmos' largest project and consuming a third of its 2010 budget of 84.5 billion rubles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbth.ru/articles/2010/12/07/glonass_hits_a_snag05184.html GLONASS hits a snag]. ''Russia Beyond The Headlines''. 7 December 2010. Retrieved on 2011-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the period of 2012 to 2020 320 billion rubles ($10 billion) were allocated to support the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iss-reshetnev.ru/images/File/newspaper/2012/318.pdf |title=Работа в интересах развития ГЛОНАСС |trans-title=Work for the development of GLONASS |date=2012-09-14 |issue=№30(318) |publisher=Сибирский спутник [Siberian Satellite] |page=3 |accessdate=2013-05-12 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GdQGUBIP?url=http://www.iss-reshetnev.ru/images/File/newspaper/2012/318.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restoring full capacity ===

In June 2008, the system consisted of 16 satellites, 12 of which were fully operational at the time. At this point, Roscosmos aimed at having a full constellation of 24 satellites in orbit by 2010, one year later than previously planned.&lt;ref name="rian_june2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080607/109483418.html|title=Russia's Glonass satellite system to be fully operational in 2010|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] signed a decree allocating additional 67 billion rubles ($2.6 billion) to GLONASS from the federal budget.&lt;ref name="rian_september2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080912/116749330.html|title=Putin orders additional $2.6 bln on Glonass development|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Promoting commercial use ====
Although the GLONASS constellation has reached global coverage, its commercialisation, especially development of the user segment, has been lacking compared to the American GPS. For example, the first commercial Russian-made GLONASS navigation device for cars, [[Glospace SGK-70]], was introduced in 2007, but it was much bigger and costlier than similar GPS receivers.&lt;ref name="moskvitch"/&gt; In late 2010, there were only a handful of GLONASS receivers on the market, and few of them were meant for ordinary consumers. To improve the situation, the Russian government has been actively promoting GLONASS for civilian use.&lt;ref name="rt_dec2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/news/sci-tech/glonass-wants-system-gps/ |title=Glonass still wants to be "the other guy in the sky" |publisher=Russia Today |date=2010-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213050452/http://rt.com/news/sci-tech/glonass-wants-system-gps/ |archivedate=13 February 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve development of the user segment, on 11 August 2010, [[Sergei Ivanov]] announced a plan to introduce a 25% import duty on all GPS-capable devices, including mobile phones, unless they are compatible with GLONASS. The government also planned to force all car manufacturers in Russia to support GLONASS starting from 2011. This would affect all car makers, including foreign brands like [[Ford]] and [[Toyota]], which have car assembly facilities in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://top.rbc.ru/economics/27/10/2010/488865.shtml |script-title=ru:Сотовые и навигаторы без ГЛОНАСС обложат пошлиной в 25%

==== Finishing the constellation ====
Russia's aim of finishing the constellation in 2010 suffered a setback when a December 2010 launch of three GLONASS-M satellites failed. The [[Proton-M]] rocket itself performed flawlessly, but the upper stage [[Blok D]]M3 (a new version that was to make its maiden flight) was loaded with too much fuel due to a sensor failure. As a result, the upper stage and the three satellites crashed into the Pacific Ocean. [[Kommersant]] estimated that the launch failure cost up to $160 million.&lt;ref name="rbth_glonass"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2010/12/07/glonass_hits_a_snag05184.html|title=GLONASS hits a snag|publisher=Kommersant|date=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] ordered a full audit of the entire program and an investigation into the failure.&lt;ref name="Fred Weir"&gt;{{cite news

Following the mishap, Roscosmos activated two reserve satellites and decided to make the first improved [[GLONASS-K]] satellite, to be launched in February 2011, part of the operational constellation instead of mainly for testing as was originally planned. This would bring the total number of satellites to 23, obtaining almost complete worldwide coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Perminov | first=Anatoly

In 2010, President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] ordered the government to prepare a new federal targeted program for GLONASS, covering the years 2012–2020. The original 2001 program is scheduled to end in 2011.&lt;ref name="rbth_glonass"/&gt; On 22 June 2011, Roscosmos revealed that the agency was looking for a funding of 402 billion rubles ($14.35 billion) for the program. The funds would be spent on maintaining the satellite constellation, on developing and maintaining navigational maps as well as on sponsoring supplemental technologies to make GLONASS more attractive to users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/glonass-asks-for-1435bln/439306.html|title=Glonass Asks for $14.35Bln |author=|publisher=The Moscow Times|date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2011 the 24th satellite of the system, a GLONASS-M, was successfully launched from [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] and is now in service.&lt;ref name=ntv&gt;[http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/241055/ GLONASS finally becomes global] [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]]. 3 October 2011. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the GLONASS constellation fully restored, for the first time since 1996.&lt;ref name=ruvr&gt;[http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/10/03/58065478.html Russia restores its orbital GLONASS group – official]. ''The Voice of Russia''. 3 October 2011. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2011 the [[Proton-M]] booster successfully put three GLONASS-M units in final orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/en/c32/264486.html|title=TASS: Archive - 3 GLONASS satellites in final orbit|work=TASS|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 28 November 2011, a [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]] rocket, launched from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome|Plesetsk Cosmodrome Space Centre]], placed a single GLONASS-M satellite into orbit into Plane 3.

On 26 April 2013 a single GLONASS-M satellite was delivered to the orbit by Soyuz rocket from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, restoring the constellation to 24 operational satellites, the minimum to provide global coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1304/26soyuz/|title=Third Soyuz launch in a week bolsters Glonass system|date=2013-04-26|accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2013 a Proton-M rocket, carrying 3 GLONASS-M satellites, crashed during takeoff from Baikonur Cosmodrome. It veered off the course just after leaving the pad and plunged into the ground nose first. The rocket employed a DM-03 booster, for the first time since the December 2010 launch, when the vehicle had also failed, resulting in a loss of another 3 satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/proton_glonass49.html |title=Russia's Proton crashes with a trio of navigation satellites |date=2013-07-02 |accessdate=2013-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812040530/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/proton_glonass49.html |archivedate=12 August 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of 2014, while the system was completed from technical point of view, the operational side was still not closed by the Ministry of Defense and its formal status was still "in development".&lt;ref name="izvestia"/&gt;

On 7 December 2015, the system was officially completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lenta.ru/news/2015/12/07/glonass/|title=Разработчики объявили о завершении создания ГЛОНАСС|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Geisha'''''|芸者}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|ʃ|ə}}; {{IPA-ja|ɡeːɕa|lang}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forvo.com/word/geisha/ |title=How to pronounce 'Geisha' |website=[[Forvo]] |access-date=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ezglot.com/words.php?l=eng&amp;w=geisha |title=English 'geisha' translations |website=EZ Glot |access-date=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo|''geiko''|芸子}}, or {{nihongo|''geigi''|芸妓}} are Japanese women who entertain through performing the ancient traditions of art, dance and singing, and are distinctively characterized by traditional costumes and makeup. 

Contrary to popular belief, Geisha are not the Eastern equivalent of a prostitute; a misconception originating in the West due to interactions with [[Oiran]] Japanese courtesans, whose traditional attire is similar to that of geisha. 

==Terms==

[[File:Konpira fune fune.jpg|thumb|''Maiko'' Tomitsuyu playing the game "Konpira Fune Fune" with a female patron]]
The word ''geisha'' consists of two [[kanji]], {{nihongo2|芸}} (''Gei'') meaning "[[art]]" and {{nihongo2|者}} (''Sha'') meaning "person" or "doer". The most literal translation of geisha into English would be "artist", "performing artist", or "artisan". Another name for geisha is ''Geiko'' ({{nihongo2|芸妓}}), which translates specifically as "Woman of Art". This term is used to refer to geisha from Western Japan, which includes Kyoto and Kanazawa.

Apprentice geisha are called ''[[Maiko]]'' ({{nihongo2|舞妓}}), literally "Woman of Dance", or ''Hangyoku'' (半玉), "Half-Jewel" (meaning that they were paid half of the wage of a full geisha),&lt;ref name="Autobiography of a Geisha"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Masuda |first=Sayo |date=2003 |title=Autobiography of a Geisha |translator-last=Rowley |translator-first=G. G. |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-12951-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by the more generic term ''o-shaku'' ({{nihongo2|御酌}}), literally "one who pours (alcohol)". The white make-up and elaborate [[kimono]] and hair of a maiko is the popular image held of geisha. A woman entering the geisha community does not have to begin as a maiko, having the opportunity to begin her career as a full geisha. Either way, however, usually a year's training is involved before debuting either as a maiko or as a geisha. A woman above 21 is considered too old to be a maiko and becomes a full geisha upon her initiation into the geisha community.

On average, Tokyo apprentices (who typically begin at 18) are slightly older than their Kyoto counterparts (who usually start at 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=218 |chapter=The Real Memoirs of Geisha |date=May 2006 |isbn=978-1-58648-394-4 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJy_g4eYX2cC&amp;pg=200 |title=The Asian Mystique: Dragon Ladies, Geisha Girls, and Our Fantasies of the Exotic Orient |first=Sheridan |last=Prasso}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, geisha often began the earliest stages of their training at a very young age, sometimes as early as 6 years old. The early ''Shikomi'' (in-training) and ''Minarai'' (learns by watching) stages of geisha training lasted for years (shikomi) and months (minarai) respectively, which is significantly longer than in contemporary times. A girl is often a shikomi for up to a year while the modern minarai period is simply one month.

It is still said that geisha inhabit a separate world which they call the ''Karyūkai'' or "The Flower and Willow World". Before [[Oiran#History|they disappeared]], the [[Oiran|courtesans]] were the colourful "flowers" and the geisha the "[[Willow#Culture|willows]]" because of their subtlety, strength, and grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=5–6 |publisher=Gotham |date=February 2004 |origyear=2003 |isbn=978-1-59240-050-8 |title=Madame [[Sada Yacco|Sadayakko]] The Geisha Who Bewitched the West |last=Downer |first=L. |chapter=In Search of Sadayakko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
In the early stages of Japanese history, there were female entertainers: ''Saburuko'' (serving girls) were mostly wandering girls whose families were displaced from struggles in the late 600s. Some of these ''saburuko'' girls sold sexual services, while others with a better education made a living by entertaining at high-class social gatherings. After the imperial court moved the capital to [[Heian-kyō]] (Kyoto) in [[Heian period#History|794]] the conditions that would form geisha culture began to emerge, as it became the home of a [[Heian period#Beauty|beauty-obsessed elite]].&lt;ref name="Gallagher"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallagher |first=John |title=Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance, and Art |location=London |publisher=PRC |date=2003 |isbn=1-85648-697-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled female performers, such as [[Shirabyōshi]] dancers, thrived.

Traditional Japan embraced sexual delights (it is not a [[Shinto]] taboo) and men were not constrained to be faithful to their wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/05/16/the-rise-of-the-geisha-photos-from-19th-20th-century-show-the-japanese-entertainers/ |title=The Rise of the Geisha - photos from 19th &amp; 20th century show the Japanese entertainers |first=Neil |last=Patrick |date=16 May 2016 |website=The Vintage News |access-date=6 November 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal wife was a modest mother and manager of the home; by [[Confucian view of marriage|Confucian custom]] love had secondary importance. For sexual enjoyment and romantic attachment, men did not go to their wives, but to [[courtesan]]s. Walled-in pleasure quarters known as {{Nihongo||遊廓、遊郭|[[yūkaku]]}} were built in the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of geisha |url=http://www.japan-zone.com/culture/geisha.shtml |website=Japan Zone |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1617 the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] designated "pleasure quarters", outside of which prostitution would be illegal,&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt; and within which ''yūjo'' ("play women") would be [[Prostitution in Japan#Shogunate era|classified and licensed]]. The highest ''yūjo'' class was the geisha's predecessor, called ''[[tayuu]]'', a combination of [[actress]] and prostitute, originally playing on stages set in the dry [[Kamo River|Kamo]] riverbed in Kyoto. They performed erotic dances and skits, and this new art was dubbed ''kabuku'', meaning "to be wild and outrageous". The dances were called "kabuki", and this was the [[Kabuki#1603.E2.80.931629: Female kabuki|beginning of kabuki theater]].&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt;

===18th-century emergence of the geisha===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Beauty - Gion Seitoku.jpg|thumb|Ukiyoe depicting a Gion geisha, from between 1800 and 1833]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - A Kyoto Geisha - Yamaguchi Soken.jpg|thumb|Ukiyoe print by Yamaguchi Soken of a Kyoto geisha]]
These pleasure quarters quickly became glamorous entertainment centers, offering more than sex. The highly accomplished courtesans of these districts entertained their clients by dancing, singing, and playing music. Some were renowned poets and [[calligraphy|calligraphers]]. Gradually, they all became specialized and the new profession, purely of entertainment, arose. It was near the turn of the eighteenth century that the first entertainers of the pleasure quarters, called ''geisha'', appeared. The first geishas were men, entertaining customers waiting to see the most popular and gifted courtesans (''[[oiran]]'').&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt;

The forerunners of the female geisha were the teenage ''odoriko'' ("dancing girls"):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of the Geisha Girl |url=https://archive.org/stream/storyofgeishagir00fujiuoft#page/18/mode/2up |first=Taizo |last=Fujimoto |page=18 |isbn=978-1-4086-9684-2 |year=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; expensively trained as chaste [[dance]]rs-for-hire. In the 1680s, they were popular paid entertainers in the private homes of upper-class samurai,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yoshiwara: the glittering world of the Japanese courtesan |first=C. S. |last=Seigle |date=March 1993 |origyear=1931 |page=171 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4T-kJB8vKvcC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=171 |chapter=Rise of the Geisha |isbn=978-0-8248-1488-5 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many had turned to prostitution by the early 18th century. Those who were no longer teenagers (and could no longer style themselves ''odoriko''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Osaka Prints: Glossary |first=J. |last=Fiorillo |url=http://www.osakaprints.com/content/information/glossary.htm |quote=''geiko'': "Arts child", originally dancing girls who were too young to be called geisha but too old (more than twenty years of age) to be called odoriko. Geiko was the pronunciation used in the Kamigata region. Some geiko operated as illegal prostitutes. By the nineteenth century the term became synonymous with geisha.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) adopted other names—one being ''"geisha"'', after the male entertainers. The first woman known to have called herself ''geisha'' was a [[Fukagawa (Tokyo)|Fukagawa]] prostitute, in about 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law |last=Tiefenbrun |first=S. |title=Copyright Infringement, Sex Trafficking, and the Fictional Life of a Geisha |volume=10 |year=2003 |ssrn=460747 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.460747 |page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a skilled singer and [[shamisen]] player named Kikuya who was an immediate success, making female geisha extremely popular in 1750s Fukagawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geisha: a unique world of tradition, elegance, and art |first=J. |last=Gallagher |date=October 2003 |publisher=PRC Publishing |isbn=978-1-85648-697-2 |page=252 |chapter=Appendix II a timeline of geisha and related history}}—Gallagher says that "Kiku" from Fukugawa district founded the profession in 1750, and that by 1753 one hundred ''odoriko'' were consigned to [[Yoshiwara]], which licensed (female) Geisha in 1761.&lt;/ref&gt; As they became more widespread throughout the 1760s and 1770s, many began working only as entertainers (rather than prostitutes), often in the same establishments as male geisha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/shopcore/978-0-8248-1488-5/ |title=Yoshiwara: The Glittering World of the Japanese Courtesan |first=Cecilia Segawa |last=Seigle |date=1931 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |pages=172-174 |access-date=22 September 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613115352/http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/shopcore/978-0-8248-1488-5/ |archive-date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the geisha===
[[File:Tokyo Geisha with Shamisen c1870s,.jpg|thumb|Tokyo ''geisha'' with ''[[shamisen]]'', circa 1870s]]
The geisha who worked within the pleasure quarters were essentially imprisoned and strictly forbidden to sell sex in order to protect the business of the [[oiran]]. While licensed courtesans existed to meet men's sexual needs, ''machi geisha'' carved out a separate niche as artists and erudite female companions.

By 1800, being a geisha was considered a female occupation (though there are still a handful of male geisha working today). Eventually, the gaudy Oiran began to fall out of fashion, becoming less popular than the chic ("[[Iki (aesthetic ideal)#Interpretation|iki]]") and modern geisha.&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt; By the 1830s, the evolving geisha style was emulated by fashionable women throughout society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geisha |url=http://www.lizadalby.com/LD/geisha.html |page=74 |chapter=The paradox of modernity |first1=L. C. |last1=Dalby |oclc=260152400}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were many different classifications and ranks of geisha. Some women would have sex with their male customers, whereas others would entertain strictly with their art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=347 |title=Kamikaze, Cherry Blossoms, and Nationalisms: The Militarization of Aesthetics in Japanese History |first=E. |last=Ohnuki-Tierney |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |date=October 2002 |isbn=978-0-226-62091-6 |quote=[Before 1796] ''kuruwa geisha'' referred to the geisha in the geisha quarters who entertained their clients with the skills and performing arts and also offered their bodies. The term ''yūjo'' and'' jorō'' were used to distinguish them from ''machi geisha'', who were exclusively entertainers ... some of the latter too engaged in sexual services}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prostitution in Japan]] was legal up until 1908, so it was practiced throughout Japan.

[[World War II]] brought a huge decline in the geisha arts because most women had to go to factories or elsewhere to contribute to post war reconstruction. The geisha name also lost some status during this time because prostitutes began referring to themselves as "geisha girls" to American military men.&lt;ref name="Dalby 1998"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dalby |first=Liza |year=1998 |title=Geisha |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the geisha world, including the teahouses, bars and geisha houses, was forced to close, and all employees were put to work in factories. About a year later, they were allowed to reopen. The few women who returned to the geisha areas decided to reject Western influence and revert to traditional ways of entertainment and life. "The image of the geisha was formed during Japan's feudal past, and this is now the image they must keep in order to remain geisha."&lt;ref name="Dalby 1998"/&gt; It was up to these returning geisha to bring back traditional standards in the profession, though with increased rights for the geisha:
{{quote |text=After Japan lost the war, geisha dispersed and the profession was in shambles. When they regrouped during the Occupation and began to flourish in the 1960s during Japan's postwar economic boom, the geisha world changed. In modern Japan, girls are not sold into indentured service. Nowadays, a geisha's sex life is her private affair. |sign=[[Liza Dalby]] |source=Do They or Don't They?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lizadalby.com/LD/ng_geisha_sex.html |title=Do They or Don't They |accessdate=12 January 2010 |last=Dalby |first=Liza |website=lizadalby.com |quote=The question always comes up...just how 'available' is a geisha? ...

There were many rumors that stated before the war, a maiko's virginity would be auctioned (the original "[[mizuage]]").&lt;ref name="Melissa Hope Ditmore 2006"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of prostitution and sex work |first=Melissa Hope |last=Ditmore |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-313-32969-9 |location=Westport, Conn |page=184 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKBvqXL0jTQC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=erikae+maiko+geiko#PPA184,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-674-01753-6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan encyclopedia |publisher=Belknap Pr of Harvard U |location= |year=2005 |page=234 |isbn=0-674-01753-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=mizuage&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this was confused with the girls who were apprentices to prostitutes and courtesans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Wayne |last2=Gallagher |first2=John |title=Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance and Art |publisher=PRC Publishing |location= |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPDkdaPE3aUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22John+Gallagher.%22+geisha#PPA135,M1 |page=135 |isbn=1-85648-697-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory education laws passed in the 1960s made traditional geisha apprenticeships difficult, leading to a decline in women entering the field.&lt;ref name="bowing out"&gt;{{cite news |last=Taubman |first=Howard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/06/12/archives/geisha-tradition-is-bowing-out-in-japan-geishas-fighting-losing.html |title=Geisha Tradition Is Bowing Out in Japan; Geishas Fighting Losing Battle Against New Trends in Japan |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 12, 1968 |page=49 |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Geisha, a Life'', [[Mineko Iwasaki]] said: "I lived in the karyukai during the 1960s and 1970s, a time when Japan was undergoing the radical transformation from a post-feudal to a modern society. But I existed in a world apart, a special realm whose mission and identity depended on preserving the time-honored traditions of the past."&lt;ref name="Mineko 2003"/&gt;

==Ranking==
At the pinnacle of the complex geisha ranking system are the [[dowager#Noun|grand dowagers]] of Kyoto. The ''Gokagai'' of Kyoto are its five geisha districts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kyoto-gion-corner.info/ookini_en/introduction.html |title=Kyoto Gokagai |publisher=Kyoto Traditional Musical Art Foundation}} The total number of Kyoto geisha had declined to 196 by 2007 (and 77 maiko); see: {{cite web |url=http://www.lizadalby.com/LD/newgeishanotes.html |title=Preface "Geisha in the 21st Century" in the 25th anniversary edition of ''Geisha'' |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as ''[[hanamachi]]'' ("flower towns"). [[Gion|Gion Kobu]], [[Pontocho]] and [[Kamishichiken]] have the highest status;&lt;ref&gt;[[Liza Dalby|Dalby]]—''Geisha'' 2008 pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; they are very expensive and are frequented by powerful businessmen and [[Politics of Japan#Human factor|politicians]]&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt; (Gion Kobu is sometimes seen as having the very highest ranking). As reported by Dalby (1983) from her impressions in 1975&lt;ref&gt;''Geisha'' 2008 pp. 18, 77, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Geiko from the other two ''hanamachi'' (Gion Higashi and [[Miyagawa Cho]]) have high prestige but are considered to be one rank lower.

==Stages of training==
[[File:Geisha, maiko, shikomi in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Geiko Fumikazu with her minarai imōto Momokazu, and a shikomi from the Odamoto okiya]]
Traditionally, Geisha began their training at a young age. Some girls were bonded to geisha houses (''[[okiya]]'') as children. Daughters of geisha were often brought up as geisha themselves, usually as the successor (atotori, meaning "heir" or "heiress" in this particular situation) or daughter-role (musume-bun) to the okiya.

A maiko is an apprentice and is therefore bonded under a contract to her okiya. The okiya supplies her with food, board, kimono, [[Obi (sash)|obi]], and other tools of her trade. Her training is very expensive and her debt must be repaid to the okiya with the earnings she makes. This repayment may continue after the maiko becomes a full-fledged geisha and only when her debts are settled is she permitted to move out to live and work independently.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;

A maiko will start her formal training on the job as a ''minarai'', which literally means "learning by watching" at an ozashiki (お座敷, a banquet in any [[Minka|traditional Japanese building]] with [[tatami]]), to sit and observe as the other maiko and geiko interact with customers. This is a way in which she will gain insights of the job, and seek out potential clients. Although minarai attend ''ozashiki'', they do not participate at an advanced level. Their [[kimono]], more elaborate than a geiko's, are intended to do the talking for them. Minarai can be hired for parties but are usually uninvited (yet welcomed) guests at parties that their ''onee-san'' attends. They only charge a third of the usual fee. Minarai generally work with a particular tea house (''Minarai-jaya'') learning from the ''okaa-san'' (literally "mother", the proprietress of the house). From her, they would learn techniques such as conversation and gaming, which would not be taught to them in school. This stage lasts only about a month or so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geisha: A Life |last1=Iwasaki |first1=Mineko |authorlink1=Mineko Iwasaki |last2=Brown Ouchi |first2=Rande |authorlink2=Rande Gail Brown |page=132 |publisher=Atria |edition=first |date=October 2002 |isbn=978-0-7434-4432-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Performing Gion Kouta.jpg|thumb|Maiko Katsumi and Mameteru performing the Gion Kouta.]]
After a short period the final stage of training begins, and the students are now called "maiko", rather than minarai. Maiko (literally "dance girl") are apprentice geisha, and this stage can last for up to 5 years. Maiko learn from their senior maiko and geiko mentors. The ''onee-san'' and ''imouto-san'' (senior/junior, literally "older sister/younger sister") relationship is important. The ''onee-san'', any maiko or geiko who is senior to a girl, teaches her maiko everything about working in the [[hanamachi]]. The onee-san will teach her proper ways of serving tea, playing [[shamisen]], dancing, casual conversation and more.

[[File:Geisha-obi.jpg|thumb|left|Senior ''maiko'' Suzuha wearing ''[[sakkō]]'', two weeks before her ''[[erikae]]''.]]
There are three major elements of a maiko's training. The first is the formal arts training. This takes place in special geisha schools which are found in every ''hanamachi''. The second element is the entertainment training which the maiko learns at various tea houses and parties by observing her ''onee-san''. The third is the social skill of navigating the complex social web of the ''hanamachi''. This is done on the streets. Formal greetings, gifts, and visits are key parts of any social structure in Japan and for a maiko, they are crucial for her to build the support network she needs to survive as a geisha.

Maiko are considered one of the great sights of Japanese tourism, and look very different from fully qualified geisha. They are at the peak of traditional Japanese femininity. The scarlet-fringed collar of a maiko's kimono hangs very loosely in the back to accentuate the nape of the neck, which is considered a primary erotic area in Japanese sexuality. She wears the same white makeup for her face on her nape, leaving two or sometimes three stripes of bare skin exposed. Her kimono is bright and colourful with an elaborately tied ''obi'' hanging down to her ankles. She takes very small steps and wears traditional wooden shoes called ''[[okobo]]'' which stand nearly ten centimeters high.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt; There are five different [[hairstyle]]s that a maiko wears, that mark the different stages of her apprenticeship. The "[[Nihongami]]" hairstyle with [[Hairstyling tool#Kanzashi|"kanzashi"]] hair-ornamentation strips is most closely associated with maiko,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nihongami no sekai |first=I. |last=Tetsuo |trans-title=The World of traditional hairstyles and hair ornaments |publisher=Nihongami Shiryōkan |isbn=4-9902186-1-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who spend hours each week at the hairdresser and sleep on holed-pillows to preserve the elaborate styling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/geisha4.htm |title=Dressing as a Geisha |first=J. |last=Layton |website=howstuffworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maiko can develop a [[#Hair|bald spot on their crown]] caused by rubbing from Kanzashi strips and tugging in hairdressing.

Around the age of 20–21, the maiko is promoted to a full-fledged geisha in a ceremony called ''[[erikae]]'' (turning of the collar).&lt;ref name="Melissa Hope Ditmore 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Wayne |last2=Gallagher |first2=John |title=Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance and Art |publisher=PRC Publishing |location= |year=2003 |page=159 |isbn=1-85648-697-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPDkdaPE3aUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22John+Gallagher.%22+geisha&amp;client=safari#PPA159,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could happen after three to five years of her life as a ''maiko'' or ''hangyoku'', depending on at what age she debuted. Geisha remain as such until they retire.

==Female dominance in geisha society==
{{quote |text=The biggest industry in Japan is not shipbuilding, producing cultured pearls, or manufacturing transistor radios or cameras. It is entertainment.|sign=Boye De Mente |source=''Some Prefer Geisha''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=De Mente |first=Boye |year=1966 |title=Some Prefer Geisha |publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Company |location=Rutland, VT}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The term geisha literally translates to "entertainer". Some prostitutes refer to themselves as "geisha", but they are not. A geisha's sex and love life is usually distinct from her professional life. A successful geisha can entertain her male customers with music, dance, and conversation.

{{quote |text=Geishas are not submissive and subservient, but in fact they are some of the most financially and emotionally successful and strongest women in Japan, and traditionally have been so.|sign=Iwasaki Mineko|source=''Geisha, A Life''&lt;ref name="Mineko 2003"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Mineko |first1=Iwasaki |first2=Rande |last2=Brown |year=2003 |title=Geisha, A Life |publisher=Washington Square |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Geisha learn the traditional skills of dance and instruments and hold high [[social status]]. Geisha are single women, though they may have lovers or boyfriends whom they have personally picked, who support them financially.

{{quote |text=There is currently no western equivalent for a geisha—they are truly the most impeccable form of Japanese art. |sign=Kenneth Champeon |source=''The Floating World''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/2130 |title=The Floating World|accessdate=12 January 2010|last=Champeon|first=Kenneth|date=3 November 2002|format=|work=|publisher=Things Asian|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Relationships with male guests===
The appeal of a high-ranking geisha to her typical male guest has historically been very different from that of his wife. The ideal geisha showed her skill, while the ideal wife was modest. The ideal geisha seemed carefree, the ideal wife somber and responsible. Historically, geisha did sometimes marry their clients, but marriage necessitated retirement, as there were never married geisha.

Geisha may gracefully flirt with their guests, but they will always remain in control of the hospitality. Over their years of apprenticeship they learn to adapt to different situations and personalities, mastering the art of the hostess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://aminoapps.com/page/anime/5627502/what-is-a-geisha |title=What Is A Geisha? |website=Amino Apps |access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geisha as a women-centered society===
Women in the geisha society are some of the most successful businesswomen in Japan. In the geisha society, women run everything. Without the impeccable business skills of the female tea house owners, the world of geisha would cease to exist. The tea house owners are entrepreneurs, whose service to the geisha is highly necessary for the society to run smoothly. Infrequently, men take contingent positions such as hair stylists,&lt;ref name="tak"/&gt; dressers (dressing a maiko requires considerable strength) and accountants,&lt;ref name="Dalby 1998"/&gt; but men have a limited role in geisha society.

{{quote |text=The geisha system was founded, actually, to promote the independence and economic self-sufficiency of women. And that was its stated purpose, and it actually accomplished that quite admirably in Japanese society, where there were very few routes for women to achieve that sort of independence. |sign=[[Mineko Iwasaki]] in interview |source=''[[Boston Phoenix]]''&lt;ref name="Wieder"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Tamara |last=Wieder |title=Remaking a memoir |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/qa/documents/02473409.htm |newspaper=[[Boston Phoenix]] |date=17 October 2002 |accessdate=12 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106181143/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/qa/documents/02473409.htm |archivedate=6 January 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The majority of women were wives who did not work outside of their familial duties. Becoming a geisha was a way for women to support themselves without becoming a wife. Thus, some argue {{who?|date=June 2018}}  that geisha women live in a women-centered society.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Women run the geisha houses, they are teachers, they run the tea houses, they recruit aspiring geisha, and they keep track of a geisha's finances.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The only major role men play in geisha society is that of guest, though women sometimes take that role as well.&lt;ref name="tak"/&gt;

Historically, [[Feminism in Japan|Japanese feminists]] have seen geisha as exploited women, but some modern geisha see themselves as liberated feminists:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1656 |title=Japanese Feminism |accessdate=12 January 2010 |last=Collins |first=Sarah |date=24 December 2007 |website=Serendip Studio}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We find our own way, without doing family responsibilities. Isn't that what feminists are?"&lt;ref name="Dalby 1998"/&gt;

==Modern geisha==
Modern geisha still live in traditional geisha houses called ''okiya'' in areas called ''[[hanamachi]]'' ({{nihongo2|花街}} "flower streets"), particularly during their apprenticeship. Many experienced geisha are successful enough to choose to live independently. The elegant, high-culture world that geisha are a part of is called ''karyūkai'' ({{nihongo2|花柳界}} "the flower and willow world").

Before the twentieth century, geisha training began when a girl was around the age of six. Now, girls must go to school until they are 15 years old and have graduated from middle school and then make the personal decision to train to become a geisha. Young women who wish to become geisha now most often begin their training after high school or even college. Many more women begin their careers in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Times |last=Jones |first=N. |date=20 April 2007 |quote=now more [university] students are interested in becoming geisha |title=Japan's geisha hit by poor economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geisha still study traditional instruments: the ''[[shamisen]]'', ''[[shakuhachi]]'', and drums, as well as learn games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=29 |title=Japan the Culture |first=B. |last=Kalman |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7787-9298-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; traditional songs, [[Japanese calligraphy#Today|calligraphy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/career-geisha-outgrow-the-stereotype/2005/12/10/1134086848297.html?page=2 |title=Career geisha outgrow the stereotype, page 2|date=11 December 2005 |accessdate=21 June 2010 |last=McCurry |first=J. |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese traditional dances (in the [[nihonbuyō]] style), [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], literature, and [[japanese poetry|poetry]].&lt;ref name="coutsoukis-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photius.com/countries/japan/society/japan_society_performing_arts.html |title=Japan Performing Arts |first=Photius |last=Coutsoukis |date=10 November 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2009}} Originally from The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coutsoukis-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photius.com/countries/japan/society/japan_society_dance.html |title=Japan Dance |first=Photius |last=Coutsoukis |date=10 November 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2009}} Originally from The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook.&lt;/ref&gt;

By watching other geisha, and with the assistance of the owner of the geisha house, apprentices also become skilled dealing with clients and in the complex traditions surrounding selecting and wearing [[kimono]], a floor length silk robe embroidered with intricate designs which is held together by a sash at the waist which is called an obi.&lt;ref name="tames-1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tames |first=Richard |title=A Traveller's History of Japan |date=September 1993 |publisher=Interlink Books |location=[[Brooklyn, New York]]|isbn=1-56656-138-8 |page= |chapter= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kalman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kalman |first=Bobbie |title=Japan the Culture |date=March 1989 |publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |location=[[Stevens Point, Wisconsin]] |isbn=0-86505-206-9 |pages= |chapter= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Japan, geisha and their apprentices are now a rare sight outside ''hanamachi'' or {{nihongo||茶屋街|chayagai|literally "tea house district", often referred to as "entertainment district"}}. In the 1920s, there were over 80,000 geisha in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggmbp2pv8toC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=geisha+80,000#v=onepage&amp;q=geisha%2080%2C000&amp;f=false |page=182 |title=Kyoto: a cultural history |first=John |last=Dougill |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-530137-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V2d12iZkgOwC&amp;pg=PA639&amp;dq=geisha+80,000#v=onepage&amp;q=geisha%2080%2C000&amp;f=false |page=639 |title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate encyclopedia |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc |year=2000 |isbn=0-87779-017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but today, there are far fewer. Most common sightings are of tourists who pay a fee to be dressed up as a maiko.&lt;ref name="lies"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUST23171020080423?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Modern-day geisha triumphs in closed, traditional world |last=Lies |first=Elaine |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2009 |website=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sluggish economy, declining interest in the traditional arts, the exclusive nature of the flower and willow world, and the expense of being entertained by geisha have all contributed to the tradition's decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/Just+Woman/News/Women+In+The+News/Story/A1Story20071203-39347.html |title=World's oldest geisha looks to future to preserve past |quote=An economic downturn in the 1990s forced businessmen to cut back on entertainment expenses, while high-profile scandals in recent years have made politicians eschew excessive spending.

But even before the 90s, men were steadily giving up on late-night parties at 'ryotei", restaurants with traditional straw-mat tatami rooms where geishas entertain, in favour of the modern comforts of hostess bars and karaoke rooms. |date=3 December 2007 |website=[[AsiaOne]] |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304074403/http://www.asiaone.com/Just+Woman/News/Women+In+The+News/Story/A1Story20071203-39347.html |archive-date=4 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the flower and willow world has seen a resurgence in new members over the last 10 years{{fact|date=September 2017}} due to the accessibility that the internet has provided for young girls wanting to know more about the profession and not needing a formal introduction to an okiya.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Ichiriki entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to [[Ichiriki Ochaya]], one of the most famous tea houses where ''geiko'' entertain in Gion Kobu]]
Geisha are often hired to attend parties and gatherings, traditionally at {{nihongo||お茶屋|[[ochaya]]|literally "tea houses"}} or at traditional Japanese restaurants (ryōtei).&lt;ref name="kalman"/&gt; The charge for a geisha's time, which used to be determined by [[Incense clock#Stick incense clocks|measuring a burning incense stick]], is called ''senkōdai'' ({{nihongo2|線香代}}, "incense stick fee") or gyokudai ({{nihongo2|玉代}} "jewel fee"). Now they are flat fees charged by the hour. In Kyoto, the terms ''ohana'' ({{nihongo2|お花}}) and ''hanadai'' ({{nihongo2|花代}}), meaning "flower fees", are preferred. The okasan makes arrangements through the geisha union office ({{nihongo2|検番}} ''kenban''), which keeps each geisha's schedule and makes her appointments both for entertaining and for training.

==Non-Japanese Geisha==
Since the 1970s, non-Japanese have also attempted to become geishas.  
[[Liza Dalby]], an American national worked briefly with geisha in the [[Pontocho]] district of [[Kyoto]] as part of her doctorate research, although she did not formally debut as a geisha herself. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hyslop |first=Leah |title=Liza Dalby, the blue-eyed geisha |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/8008802/Liza-Dalby-the-blue-eyed-geisha.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=18 July 2011 |location=London |date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liza |first=Dalby |title=Geisha |year=1983 |publisher=Vintage U.K. |location=London |isbn=9780099286387 |pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The district of [[Gion]] in [[Kyoto, Japan]] does not accept non-Japanese women to train for becoming a geisha due to their ultra–traditionalist environment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Other foreign nationals who have completed training and worked as geisha in Japan include the following:

==Public performances==
While traditionally geishas have led a cloistered existence, in recent years they have become more publicly visible, and entertainment is available without requiring the traditional introduction and connections.

The most visible form of this are public dances, or ''[[Japanese traditional dance|odori]]'' (generally written in [[Historical kana orthography|traditional kana spelling]] as をどり, rather than modern おどり), featuring both maikos and geishas. All the Kyoto hanamachi hold these annually (mostly in spring, with one exclusively in autumn), dating to the [[Kyoto exhibition]] of 1872,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intojapan.co.uk/festivals/maiko-dance.php |title=Maiko Dance |website=Into Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many performances, with tickets being inexpensive, ranging from around 1500 yen to 4500 yen – top-price tickets also include an optional [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] (tea and [[wagashi]] served by maiko) before the performance;&lt;ref name="geishadances"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geishaofjapan.com/tourism/dances.html |title=Geisha dances |website=Geisha of Japan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102225341/http://www.geishaofjapan.com/tourism/dances.html |archivedate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Hanamachi#Kyoto hanamachi|Kyoto hanamachi]] and [[Hanamachi#Hanamachi in Kanazawa|Kanazawa hanamachi]] for a detailed listing.

[[File:Two geishas playing shamisen.jpg|thumb|''Geisha'' Komomo and Mameyoshi from Gion Kobu playing ''shamisen'']]
Geisha begin their study of music and dance when they are very young and continue it throughout their lives. Geisha can work into their eighties and nineties,&lt;ref name="kyotox"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/Just+Woman/News/Women+In+The+News/Story/A1Story20071203-39347.html |title=World's oldest geisha looks to future to preserve past |date=3 December 2007 |quote=Girls in the past could become apprentice geishas from the age of 13, but it is now illegal to become an apprentice before 18 except in Kyoto where a girl can be an apprentice at 15. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are expected to train every day even after seventy years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Times |last=Jones |first=N. |date=20 April 2007 |quote=Even the older sisters who became geisha as teenagers, they are [now] over 80 but still train every day |title=Japan's geisha hit by poor economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance of the geisha has evolved from the dance performed on the noh and kabuki stages. The "wild and outrageous" dances transformed into a more subtle, stylized, and controlled form of dance. It is extremely disciplined, similar to [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]]. Every dance uses gestures to tell a story and only a connoisseur can understand the subdued symbolism. For example, a tiny hand gesture represents reading a love letter, holding the corner of a handkerchief in the mouth represents coquetry and the long sleeves of the elaborate kimono are often used to symbolize dabbing tears.&lt;ref name="Downer"&gt;{{cite book |first=Lesley |last=Downer |chapter=The City Geisha and Their Role in Modern Japan: Anomaly or artistes  |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-iuYBiOkRgC&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |editor-last1=Feldman |editor-first1=Martha |editor-last2=Gordon |editor-first2=Bonnie |title=The Courtesan's Arts: Cross-Cultural Perspectives |date=23 March 2006 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-517029-0 |pages=223–242}}{{Vague|date=January 2010}}&lt;!-- Let's have precise page numbers --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The dances are accompanied by traditional Japanese music. The primary instrument is the [[shamisen]]. The shamisen was introduced to the geisha culture in 1750 and has been mastered by female Japanese artists for years.&lt;ref name=Maske&gt;{{Cite book |last=Maske |first=Andrew L. |title=Geisha: Beyond the Painted Smile |location=Peabody |publisher=[[Peabody Essex Museum]] |date=2004 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shamisen, originating in Okinawa, is a banjo-like three-stringed instrument that is played with a [[Plectrum#Non-Western instruments|plectrum]]. It has a very distinct, melancholy sound that is often accompanied by flute. The instrument is described as "melancholy" because traditional shamisen music uses only [[minor third]]s and sixths.&lt;ref name=Maske/&gt; All geisha must learn shamisen-playing, though it takes years to master. Along with the shamisen and the flute, geisha also learned to play a ''[[Tsuzumi|ko-tsuzumi]]'', a small, [[hourglass drum|hourglass-shaped]] shoulder drum, and a large floor ''[[taiko]]'' (drum). Some geisha would not only dance and play music, but would write beautiful, melancholy poems. Others painted pictures or composed music.&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt;

Sheridan Prasso wrote that Americans had "an incorrect impression of the real geisha world ... geisha means 'arts person' trained in music and dance, not in the art of sexual pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Asian-Mystique-Fantasies-ebook/dp/B0036FTOBW |title=The Asian Mystique: Dragon Ladies, Geisha Girls, and Our Fantasies of the Exotic Orient |last=Prasso |first=Sheridan |date=April 2009 |location=New York |publisher=Public Affairs |isbn=978-1-58648-214-5 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; K.&amp;nbsp;G. Henshall wrote that the geisha's purpose was "to entertain their customer, be it by dancing, reciting verse, playing musical instruments, or engaging in light conversation. Geisha engagements may include flirting with men and playful [[innuendo]]s; however, clients know that nothing more can be expected. In a social style that is common in Japan, men are amused by the illusion of that which is never to be."&lt;ref name="Henshall"&gt;{{cite book |last=Henshall |first=K. G. |date=1999 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Macmillan Press |location=London |isbn=0-333-74940-5 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, shortly after the [[Meiji Restoration]], the new government passed a law liberating "prostitutes (shōgi) and geisha (geigi)". The wording of this statute was the subject of controversy. Some officials thought that prostitutes and geisha worked at different ends of the same profession—selling sex— and that all prostitutes should henceforth be called "geisha". In the end, the government decided to maintain a line between the two groups, arguing that geisha were more refined and should not be soiled by association with prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Matsugu"&gt;{{cite book |first=Miho |last=Matsugu |chapter=In the Service of the Nation: Geisha and Kawabata Yasunari's 'Snow Country' |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-iuYBiOkRgC&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |editor-last1=Feldman |editor-first1=Martha |editor-last2=Gordon |editor-first2=Bonnie |title=The Courtesan's Arts: Cross-Cultural Perspectives |date=2006 |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-517028-8 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, geisha working in ''[[onsen]]'' towns such as [[Atami]] are dubbed [[onsen geisha]]. Onsen geisha have been given a bad reputation due to the prevalence of prostitutes in such towns who market themselves as "geisha". In contrast to these "one-night geisha", the true onsen geisha are competent dancers and musicians. However, the [[Autobiography of a Geisha|autobiography of Sayo Masuda]], an onsen geisha who worked in Nagano Prefecture in the 1930s, reveals that in the past, such women were often under intense pressure to sell sex.&lt;ref name="Autobiography of a Geisha"/&gt;

===Personal relationships and Danna partnership===
Geisha are portrayed as unattached. Formerly those who chose to marry had to retire from the profession, though today, some geisha are allowed to marry. It was traditional in the past for established geisha to take a ''danna'', or patron. A ''danna'' was typically a wealthy man, sometimes married, who had the means to support the very large expenses related to a geisha's traditional training and other costs. This sometimes occurs today as well, but very rarely. A geisha and her danna may or may not be in love, but intimacy is never viewed as a reward for the danna's financial support. While it is true that a geisha is free to pursue personal relationships with men she meets through her work, such relationships are carefully chosen and unlikely to be casual. A hanamachi tends to be a very tight-knit community and a geisha's good reputation is not taken lightly.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

==="Geisha (Gee-sha) girls"===
During the period of [[occupied Japan|the Allied occupation of Japan]], local women called "Geisha girls" worked as prostitutes. They almost exclusively serviced [[Military of the United States|American GIs]] stationed in the country, who actually referred to them as "Geesha girls" (a mispronunciation).&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Ozeki |title=Inside and other short fiction: Japanese women by Japanese women |publisher=Kodansha International |year=2005 |isbn=4-7700-3006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women dressed in ''kimono'' and imitated the look of geisha. Many Americans unfamiliar with the Japanese culture could not tell the difference between legitimate geisha and these costumed performers.&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt; Shortly after their arrival in 1945, some occupying American GIs are said to have congregated in [[Ginza]] and shouted, "We want geesha girls!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Booth |title=Looking for the Lost: Journeys Through a Vanishing Japan |publisher=Kodansha Globe Series |date=1995 |isbn=1-56836-148-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eventually, the English term "geisha girl" became a general word for any female Japanese prostitute or worker in the [[mizu shōbai]] and included [[Hostess bar|bar hostesses]] and [[streetwalker]]s.&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt;

Geisha girls are speculated by [[Japanology|researchers]] to be largely responsible for the continuing misconception in [[Western world|the West]] that all geisha are engaged in prostitution.&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt;

===Mizuage===
{{Main article|Mizuage}}
'''Mizuage''' ({{nihongo2|水揚げ}}) was a ceremony undergone by a maiko where she was promoted to [[senior status]] and changed her hairstyle from the junior wareshinobu to the senior ofuku.&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt; A ritual deflowering, also called mizuage, was practiced among prostitutes and geisha in smaller towns where these occupations often blurred lines. Prostitutes posing as geisha often used this term to refer to their acts with customers, which lead to great confusion when such prostitutes often called themselves "geisha" in the company of foreign soldiers and even Japanese customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geishaofjapan.com/history/world-war-ii-and-the-american-occupation/ |title=World War II and the American Occupation |website=Geisha of Japan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mizuage literally means "raising the waters" and originally meant unloading a ship's cargo of fish.&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;{{cite book |title=East Wind Melts the Ice: A Memoir through the Seasons by Liza Dalby |date=February 2009 |authorlink=Liza Dalby |first=L. |last=Dalby |publisher=University of California Press |chapter=Waters dry up |isbn=978-0-520-25991-1 |pages=190–191 |quote=The resulting official line that geisha live by art alone is unrealistically [[prude|prudish]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the word came to represent money earned in the entertainment business.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;

==Appearance==
[[File:Geisha-and-two-maiko.jpg|thumb|Mature ''geisha'' (center) ordinarily wear subdued clothing, makeup, and hair, contrasting with the more colourful clothing, heavy makeup, and elaborate hair of maiko (apprentices; left and right).]]

A geisha's appearance changes throughout her career, from the girlish, heavily made-up maiko, to the more somber appearance of an older established geisha. Different hairstyles and hairpins signify different stages of a girl's development and even a detail as minute as the length of one's eyebrows is significant. Short eyebrows are for the young and long eyebrows display maturity.&lt;ref name=Prasso&gt;Prasso, Sheridan. "The Asian Mystique." New York: Public Affairs, 2005:206&lt;/ref&gt;

===Makeup===
{{Further information|History of cosmetics}}
In modern times the traditional makeup of apprentice geisha is one of their most recognizable characteristics, though established geisha generally only wear full white face makeup characteristic of maiko during special performances.

The traditional makeup of an apprentice geisha features a thick white base with red [[lipstick]] and red and black accents around the eyes and eyebrows. Originally, the white base mask was made with lead; after the discovery that it poisoned the skin and caused terrible skin and back problems for the older geisha towards the end of the [[Meiji period|Meiji Era]], it was replaced with rice powder.

The application of makeup is hard to perfect and is time-consuming. Makeup is applied before dressing to avoid dirtying the kimono. First, a wax or oil substance called ''bintsuke-abura'' is applied to the skin. Next, white powder is mixed with water into a paste and applied with a bamboo brush starting from the neck and working upwards. The white makeup covers the face, neck, and chest, with two or three unwhitened areas (forming a ''W'' or ''V'' shape, usually a traditional ''W'' shape) left on the [[nape]], to accentuate this traditionally erotic area, and a line of bare skin around the hairline, which creates the illusion of a mask.

After the foundation layer is applied, a sponge is patted all over the face, throat, chest, the nape and neck to remove excess moisture and to blend the foundation. Next the eyes and eyebrows are drawn in. Traditionally, charcoal was used, but today, modern cosmetics are used. The eyebrows and edges of the eyes are coloured black with a thin charcoal; a maiko also applies red around her eyes.

The lips are filled in using a small brush. The colour comes in a small stick, which is melted in water. Crystallized sugar is then added to give the lips luster. Rarely will a geisha colour in both lips fully in the Western style, as white creates optical illusions and colouring the lips fully would make them appear overly large. The lower lip is coloured in partially and the upper lip left white for maiko in her first year, after which the upper lip is coloured. Newly full-fledged geisha will colour in only the top lip fully. Most geisha wear the top lip coloured in fully or stylized, and the bottom lip in a curved stripe that does not follow the shape of the lip. Geisha round the bottom lips to create the illusion of a flower bud.

Maiko who are in their last stage of training sometimes [[Ohaguro|colour their teeth black]] for a brief period. This practice used to be common among married women in Japan and, earlier, at the imperial court, but survives only in some districts. It is done partly because uncoloured teeth seem very yellow in contrast to white face makeup; colouring the teeth black means that they seem to "disappear" in the darkness of the open mouth. This illusion is of course more pronounced at a distance.

For the first year, a maiko wears this heavy makeup almost constantly. During her initiation, the maiko is helped with her makeup either by her ''onee-san'', or "older sister" (an experienced geisha who is her mentor), or by the ''okaa-san'', or "mother" of her geisha house. After this, she applies the makeup herself.

After a maiko has been working for three years, she changes her make-up to a more subdued style. The reason for this is that she has now become mature, and the simpler style shows her own natural beauty. For formal occasions, the mature geisha will still apply white make-up. For geisha over thirty, the heavy white make-up is only worn during those special dances that require it.

===Dress===
[[File:Maiko and geisha back.jpg|thumb|A senior ''maiko'' (left) with ''darari obi'' and ''geisha'' with ''taiko-musubi'']]
[[File:Niigata geisha dancing2.jpg|thumb|Niigata ''geisha'' performing dance, dressed in ''kimono'' and ''taiko musubi'']]
Geisha always wear [[kimono]]. Apprentice geisha wear highly colourful kimono with extravagant [[Obi (sash)|obi]]. The obi is brighter than the kimono she is wearing to give a certain exotic balance. Maiko of Kyoto wear the obi tied in a style called "darari" (dangling obi), while Tokyo "hangyoku" wear it tied in various ways, including taiko musubi. Older geisha of Kyoto wear more subdued patterns and styles (most notably the obi tied in a simpler knot used by married women known as the "taiko musubi" ({{nihongo2|太鼓結び}}), or "drum knot"). Tokyo and Kanazawa geisha wear {{nihongo|"yanagi musubi"|柳結び||''willow style''}}, taiko musubi and {{nihongo|"tsunodashi musubi"|角出結び}}.

The colour, pattern, and style of ''kimono'' is dependent on the season and the event the geisha is attending. A ''kimono'' can take from two to three years to complete, due to painting and embroidering.

Geiko wear red or pink ''nagajuban'', or under-kimono. A maiko wears red with white printed patterns. The junior maiko's collar is predominantly red with white, silver, or gold embroidery. Two to three years into her apprenticeship, the red collar will be entirely embroidered in white (when viewed from the front) to show her seniority. When she becomes a fully fledged geisha her collar will turn from red to solid white.

Geisha wear raised wooden sandals, called ''[[geta (footwear)|geta]]'' while maiko wear a special wooden sandal known as ''[[okobo]]'' and wear only ''[[tabi]]'' (white split-toed socks) indoors. Geisha and apprentices wear the flat-soled sandal ''[[zōri]]'' outdoors during inclement weather.

===Hair===
[[File:Geiko - Tea ceremony.jpg|thumb|Mamechiho as a ''geiko''.]]
The hairstyles of geisha have varied through history. In the past, it has been common for women to wear their hair down in some periods and up in others. During the 17th century, women began putting all their hair up again, and it is during this time that the traditional [[shimada (hairstyle)|shimada hairstyle]], a type of [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]] worn by most established geisha, developed.

There are two major types of the shimada seen in the karyukai: the ''Taka Shimada'', a high mage (high section) usually worn by young, single women and the ''Tsubushi Shimada'', a more flattened mage generally worn by older women Additional hairstyles for maiko include Wareshinobu, Ofuku, Katsuyama, Yakko Shimada, and [[Sakkō]]. Maiko of Pontocho will wear an additional six hairstyles leading up to Sakkō, including Oshidori, Kikugasane, Yuiwata, Suisha, Oshun, and Osafune.

These hairstyles are decorated with elaborate hair-combs and hairpins ([[kanzashi]]). Beginning In the seventeenth century and continuing through the [[Meiji Restoration]] period, hair-combs were large and conspicuous, generally more ornate for higher-class women. Following the Meiji Restoration and into the modern era, smaller and less conspicuous hair-combs became more popular.

Maiko sleep with their necks on small supports (takamakura), instead of pillows, so they keep their hairstyle perfect.&lt;ref name="tak"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/career-geisha-outgrow-the-stereotype/2005/12/10/1134086848297.html?page=3 |title=Career geisha outgrow the stereotype |date=11 December 2005 |accessdate=21 June 2010 |last=McCurry |first=J. |page=3 |location=Melbourne |newspaper=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if there are no accidents, a maiko will need her hair styled every week. Many modern geisha use [[wig]]s in their professional lives, while maiko use their natural hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/a-week-in-the-life-of-koaki-apprentice-geisha--schooled-in-the-arts-of-pleasure-1170322.html |title=A Week in the Life of: Koaki, Apprentice Geisha – Schooled in the arts of pleasure |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=8 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either must be regularly tended by highly skilled artisans. Traditional hairstyling is a slowly dying art. Over time, the hairstyle can cause balding on the top of the head.

{{nihongo||先笄|'''[[Sakkō]]'''}} is a Japanese [[hairstyle]]. It is worn by maiko today, but was worn in the [[Edo period]] by wives to show their dedication to their husbands. Maiko wear it during a ceremony called [[Erikae]], which marks their graduation from maiko to [[geiko]]. Maiko use black wax to stain their teeth as well. Crane and  [[tortoiseshell]] ornaments are added as [[kanzashi]]. The style is twisted in many knots, and is quite striking and elaborate.

==In popular culture==
A growing number of geisha have complained to the authorities about being pursued down the street and tugged on the sleeves of their kimonos by groups of tourists keen to take their photograph. As a result, residents and local businesses have joined forces to protect the geisha by launching patrols of the streets of Kyoto's Gion entertainment district in order to prevent tourists from pestering them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/4018220/Tourists-warned-to-stop-harassing-Kyotos-geisha.html |title=Tourists warned to stop 'harassing' Kyoto's geisha |first=Danielle |last=Demetriou |date=30 December 2008 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stories are told about geisha. This includes Arthur Golden's popular English-language novel ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' which was adapted into a film in 2005.

{{more footnotes|date=May 2010}}
'''Genre''' ({{ety|fr|genre|kind, sort}}) is any form or type of [[communication]] in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) with socially-agreed upon conventions developed over time. Genre is most popularly known as a [[Category of being|category]] of [[literature]], [[music]], or other forms of art or entertainment, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria, yet genres can be aesthetic, rhetorical, communicative, or functional. Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility.

Genre began as an absolute classification system for [[ancient Greek literature]].{{cn|date=March 2018}} [[Poetry]] ([[ode]]s,  [[Epic poetry|epics]], etc.), [[prose]], and [[performance]] each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best.

In later periods{{when?|date=March 2018}} genres proliferated and developed in response to changes in audiences and creators.  Genre became a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictable art. Because art is often a response to a social state, in that people write/paint/sing/dance about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings.

Genre suffers from the ills of any classification system. It has been suggested{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} that genres resonate with people because of the familiarity, the shorthand communication, as well as because of the tendency of genres to shift with public [[mores]] and to reflect the [[zeitgeist]]. While the genre of [[storytelling]] has been relegated{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} as lesser form of art because of the heavily borrowed nature of the [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], admiration has grown. Proponents{{who?|date=March 2018}} argue that the genius of an effective genre piece is in the variation, recombination, and evolution of the codes.

==Visual arts==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|A genre painting (''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder) ]]

The term ''genre'' is much used in the history and criticism of visual art, but in [[art history]] has meanings that overlap rather confusingly. [[Genre painting]] is a term for paintings where the main subject features human figures to whom no specific identity attaches{{spaced ndash}}in other words, figures are not portraits, characters from a story, or allegorical personifications. These are distinguished from [[staffage]]: incidental figures in what is primarily a [[landscape art|landscape]] or architectural painting. ''Genre painting'' may also be used as a wider term covering genre painting proper, and other specialized types of paintings such as [[still-life]], landscapes, [[marine painting]]s and animal paintings.

The concept of the "[[hierarchy of genres]]" was a powerful one in artistic theory, especially between the 17th and 19th centuries.  It was strongest in France, where it was associated with the [[Académie française]] which held a central role in [[academic art]]. The genres in hierarchical order are:
* [[History painting]], including narrative religious mythological and allegorical subjects
* [[Portrait painting]]
* Genre painting or scenes of everyday life
* Landscape (landscapists were the "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" according to the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]]) and cityscape
* [[Animal painter|Animal painting]]
* [[Still life]]

==Literature==
{{Literature}}
{{Main article|Literary genre|List of literary genres}}
A literary genre is a category of literary composition. Genres may be determined by [[literary technique]], [[setting tone|tone]], [[Content (media)|content]], or even (as in the case of fiction) length. Genre should not be confused with age category, by which literature may be classified as either adult, [[young adult fiction|young adult]], or [[children's literature|children's]].  They also must not be confused with format, such as [[graphic novel]] or picture book. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups.

The most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) [[epic poetry|epic]], [[tragedy]],&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1983, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[comedy]], [[novel]], and [[short story]]. They can all be in the genres [[prose]] or [[poetry]], which shows best how loosely genres are defined. Additionally, a genre such as [[satire]] might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general [[cultural movement]] of the [[historical period]] in which they were composed.  In [[popular fiction]], which is especially divided by genres, [[genre fiction]] is the more usual term.

In [[literature]], genre has been known as an intangible [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].  This taxonomy implies a concept of containment or that an idea will be stable forever.The earliest recorded systems of genre in [[Western world|Western history]] can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle. Gérard Genette, a French literary theorist and author of ''The Architext'', describes Plato as creating three Imitational genres: dramatic dialogue, pure narrative, and [[Epic (genre)|epic]] (a mixture of dialogue and narrative). [[Lyric poetry]], the fourth and final type of [[Greek literature]], was excluded by Plato as a non-mimetic mode. Aristotle later revised Plato's system by eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode and distinguishing by two additional criteria: the object to be imitated, as objects could be either superior or inferior, and the medium of presentation such as words, gestures or verse.  Essentially, the three categories of mode, object, and medium can be visualized along an XYZ axis.

Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: [[tragedy]] (superior-dramatic dialogue), [[epic poetry|epic]] (superior-mixed narrative), [[comedy]] (inferior-dramatic dialogue), and [[parody]] (inferior-mixed narrative). Genette continues by explaining the later integration of lyric poetry into the classical system during the [[Romanticism|romantic period]], replacing the now removed pure narrative mode. Lyric poetry, once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third leg of a new tripartite system: lyrical, epical, and dramatic dialogue. This system, which came to "dominate all the literary theory of German romanticism (and therefore well beyond)…" (38), has seen numerous attempts at expansion or revision. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing scope and complexity.

Genette reflects upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: "its structure is somewhat superior to…those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse" (74). Taxonomy allows for a structured classification system of genre, as opposed to a more contemporary rhetorical model of genre.

==Film==
{{main article|Film genre}}
The basic genres of film can be regarded as drama, in the [[feature film]] and most [[cartoon]]s, and [[documentary]].  Most dramatic feature films, especially from [[Hollywood]] fall fairly comfortably into one of a long list of film genres such as the [[Western film|Western]], [[war film]], [[horror film]], [[romantic comedy|romantic comedy film]], [[musical film|musical]], [[crime film]], and many others. Many of these genres have a number of subgenres, for example by setting or subject, or a distinctive national style, for example in the Indian [[Bollywood]] musical.

==Music==
{{main article|Music genre}}
A '''music genre''' is a conventional category that identifies pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Samson, Jim. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40599 "Genre"]. In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Accessed March 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} There are numerous genres in Western [[classical music]] and [[popular music]], as well as [[musical theatre]] and the music of non-Western cultures. The term is now perhaps over-used to describe relatively small differences in musical style in modern [[rock music]], that also may reflect sociological differences in their audiences.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Timothy Laurie suggests that in the context of rock and pop music studies, the "appeal of genre criticism is that it makes narratives out of musical worlds that often seem to lack them".&lt;ref name="Laurie 2014"&gt;{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp. 283-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music can be divided into different genres in several ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often arbitrary and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are several academic approaches to genres. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. According to Green, "Beethoven's ''Op. 61'' and Mendelssohn's ''Op. 64'' are identical in genre&amp;nbsp;– both are violin concertos&amp;nbsp;– but different in form. However, Mozart's ''Rondo for Piano, K. 511'', and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his ''Mass, K. 317'' are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Form in Tonal Music |last=Green |first=Douglass M. |year=1965 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc |isbn=0-03-020286-8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or "basic musical language".&lt;ref name=Pete&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music |last=van der Merwe |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist) |year=1989 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-316121-4 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, Allan F.
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3526163 "Categorical Conventions in Music Discourse: Style and Genre"]. ''Music &amp; Letters'', Vol. 82, No. 3 (Aug. 2001), pp. 432–442.&lt;/ref&gt; A music genre or subgenre may be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the styles, the context, and content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres.

Several music scholars have criticised the priority accorded to genre-based communities and listening practices. For example, Laurie argues that "music genres do not belong to isolated, self-sufficient communities. People constantly move between environments where diverse forms of music are heard, advertised and accessorised with distinctive iconographies, narratives and celebrity identities that also touch on non-musical worlds."&lt;ref name="Laurie 2014"/&gt;

==Popular culture and other media==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The concept of genre is often applied, sometimes rather loosely, to other media with an artistic element, such as [[video game genres]]. Genre, and numerous minutely divided subgenres, affect popular culture very significantly, not least as they are used to classify it for publicity purposes.  The vastly increased output of popular culture in the age of electronic media encourages dividing cultural products by genre to simplify the search for products by consumers, a trend the Internet has only intensified.

==Linguistics==
In [[philosophy of language]], genre figures prominently in the works of philosopher and literary scholar [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]. Bakhtin's basic observations were of "speech genres" (the idea of [[heteroglossia]]), modes of speaking or writing that people learn to mimic, weave together, and manipulate (such as "formal letter" and "grocery list", or "university lecture" and "personal anecdote"). In this sense, genres are socially specified: recognized and defined (often informally) by a particular culture or community. The work of [[Georg Lukács]] also touches on the nature of [[literary genre]]s, appearing separately but around the same time (1920s–1930s) as Bakhtin. [[Norman Fairclough]] has a similar concept of genre that emphasizes the social context of the text: Genres are "different ways of (inter)acting discoursally" (Fairclough, 2003: 26).

A text's genre may be determined by its:

# Linguistic function.
# Formal traits.
# Textual organization.
# Relation of communicative situation to formal and organizational traits of the text (Charaudeau and Maingueneau, 2002:278–280).

==Rhetoric==
In the field of [[rhetoric]], genre theorists usually understand genres as types of actions rather than types or forms of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi, A. S., &amp; Mary Jo Reiff. (2010). [http://wac.colostate.edu/books/bawarshi_reiff/ Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy.] chs. 5 and 6&lt;/ref&gt; On this perspective, texts are channels through which genres are enacted. Carolyn Miller's&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C. R. (1984). Genre as social action. Quarterly Journal of Speech, 70(2), 151–167.&lt;/ref&gt; work has been especially important for this perspective. Drawing on [[Lloyd Bitzer]]'s concept of rhetorical situation,&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, L. F. (1968). The Rhetorical Situation. Philosophy and Rhetoric, 1(1), 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller reasons that recurring rhetorical problems tend to elicit recurring responses; drawing on [[Alfred Schütz]],&lt;ref&gt;Schutz, A., &amp; Luckmann, T. (1973). The Structures of the Life-World. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; she reasons that these recurring responses become "typified" – that is, socially constructed as recognizable types. Miller argues that these "typified rhetorical actions" (p.&amp;nbsp;151) are properly understood as genres.

Building off of Miller, [[Charles Bazerman]] and Clay Spinuzzi have argued that genres understood as actions derive their meaning from other genres – that is, other actions. Bazerman therefore proposes that we analyze genres in terms of "genre systems",&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman, C. (1994). Systems of Genre and the Enactment of Social Intentions. In Genre and the New Rhetoric (pp. 79–101). London/Bristol: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; while Spinuzzi prefers the closely related concept of "genre ecologies".&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi, C., &amp; Zachry, M. (2000). Genre Ecologies : An Open-System Approach to Understanding and Constructing Documentation. ACM Journal of Computer Documentation, 24(3), 169–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition has had implications for the teaching of writing in American colleges and universities. Combining rhetorical genre theory with [[activity theory]], David Russell has proposed that standard English composition courses are ill-suited to teach the genres that students will write in other contexts across the university and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, D. R. (1995). Activity theory and its implications for writing instruction. In J. Petraglia (Ed.), Reconceiving writing, rethinking writing instruction (pp. 51–78). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Wardle contends that standard composition courses do teach genres, but that these are inauthentic "mutt genres" that are often of little use outside of composition courses.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, E. (2009). "Mutt Genres" and the Goal of FYC: Can we Help Students Write the Genres of the University? College Composition and Communication, 60(4), 765–789.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This concept of genre originated from the classification systems created by [[Plato]]. Plato divided [[literature]] into the three classic genres accepted in [[Ancient Greece]]: [[poetry]], [[drama]], and [[prose]]. [[Poetry]] is further subdivided into [[epic poetry|epic]], [[lyric poetry|lyric]], and [[drama]]. The divisions are recognized as being set by [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]; however, they were not the only ones. Many genre theorists added to these accepted forms of [[poetry]].

===Classical and Romance genre theory===
The earliest recorded systems of genre in Western history can be traced back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle#Rhetoric and poetics|Aristotle]]. [[Gérard Genette]] explains his interpretation of the history of genre in "The Architext". He described Plato as the creator of three imitational, mimetic genres distinguished by mode of imitation rather than content. These three imitational genres include dramatic dialogue, the [[drama]]; pure narrative, the [[dithyramb]]; and a mixture of the two, the [[Epic (genre)|epic]]. Plato excluded [[lyric poetry]] as a non-mimetic, imitational mode. Genette further discussed how Aristotle revised Plato's system by first eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode. He then uses two additional criteria to distinguish the system. The first of the criteria is the object to be imitated, whether superior or inferior. The second criterion is the medium of presentation: words, gestures, or verse. Essentially, the three categories of [[mode (literature)|mode]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], and [[Medium (communication)|medium]] can be visualized along an XYZ axis. Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: [[tragedy]], [[Epic (genre)|epic]], [[comedy]], and [[parody]].

Genette explained the integration of lyric poetry into the classical system by replacing the removed pure narrative mode. [[Lyric poetry]], once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third "Architext", a term coined by Gennette, of a new long-enduring tripartite system: lyrical; epical, the mixed narrative; and dramatic, the dialogue. This new system that came to "dominate all the literary theory of [[German romanticism]]" (Genette 38) has seen numerous attempts at expansion and revision. Such attempts include [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel's]] triad of subjective form, the lyric; objective form, the dramatic; and subjective-objective form, the epic. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing complexity. Gennette reflected upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: "its structure is somewhat superior to most of those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse".

==Culture==
Genre is embedded in [[culture]] but may clash with it at times. There are occasions in which a cultural group may not be inclined to keep within the set structures of a genre. Anthony Pare's studied Inuit social workers in "Genre and Identity: Individuals, Institutions and Ideology". In this study, Pare described the conflict between the genre of Inuit social workers' record keeping forms and the cultural values that prohibited them from fully being able to fulfill the expectations of this genre. Amy Devitt further expands on the concept of culture in her 2004 essay, "A Theory of Genre" by adding "culture defines what situations and genres are likely or possible" (Devitt 24).

Genre not only coexists with culture but also defines its very components. Genres abound in daily life and people often work within them unconsciously; people often take for granted their prominence and ever present residence in society. Devitt touches on Miller's idea of situation, but expands on it and adds that the relationship with genre and situation is reciprocal. Individuals may find themselves shaping the rhetorical situations, which in turn affect the rhetorical responses that arise out of the situation. Because the social workers worked closely with different families, they did not want to disclose many of the details that are standard in the genre of record keeping related to this field. Giving out such information would violate close cultural ties with the members of their community.

==Audiences==
Although genres are not always precisely definable, genre considerations are one of the most important factors in determining what a person will see or read. The classification properties of genre can attract or repel potential users depending on the individual's understanding of a genre.

Genre creates an expectation in that expectation is met or not. Many genres have built-in audiences and corresponding publications that support them, such as [[magazine]]s and websites. Inversely, audiences may call out for change in an antecedent genre and create an entirely new genre.

The term may be used in categorizing [[web page]]s, like "news page" and "fan page", with both very different layout, audience, and intention (Rosso, 2008). Some search engines like [[Vivísimo]] try to group found web pages into automated categories in an attempt to show various genres the search hits might fit.

==Subgenre==
A subgenre is a [[Hierarchy|subordinate]] within a genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subgenre|title=subgenre|publisher=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/subgenre|title=Subgenre|work=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two stories being the same genre can still sometimes differ in subgenre. For example, if a [[fantasy]] story has darker and more frightening elements of fantasy, it would belong in the subgenre of [[dark fantasy]]; whereas another fantasy story that features [[magic sword]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizards]] would belong to the subgenre of [[sword and sorcery]].

'''Gjergj Pekmezi''' (3 April 1872 - 4 February 1938) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] linguist, philosopher and folklorist. In 1916, he became a member of the Literary Commission of [[Shkodër]], which established the first standard form of the [[Albanian language]].
&lt;!---[[File:Lehr- und Lesebuch des Albanischen, Vienna , 1913.png|thumb|right|Lehr und Lesebuch des Albanischen, 1913]]---&gt;

== Early life ==
Pekmezi was born in [[Tushemisht]], [[Pogradec]] (modern day [[Albania]]). He began his initial studies in [[Ohrid]] and [[Bitola|Monastir]], moving on to [[Belgrade]] from 1890-1894. He later graduated from the [[University of Vienna]]  in [[philosophy]] and [[philology]] in 1898. After his graduation, Pekmezi returned to Albania. 

== Career ==
In 1903, Pekmezi was elected to direct the Albanian language [[cathedra]] at the Oriental University of Vienna.&lt;ref name="Skendi261"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=261.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the cultural-patriotic society Dija (Knowledge) in 1904 with [[Hile Mosi]], Kolë Rrota and other Albanian intellectuals. In the late Ottoman period, Austria-Hungary subsidized two of Pekmezi's works: ''Albanesische Bibliographie'' and ''Albanianische Grammatik''.&lt;ref name="Skendi277"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=The+Albanian+National+Awakening&amp;ots=zGjQbVyql8&amp;sig=xsmbL-yAAtc-ny3v0E4vN87JOBY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Pekmezi&amp;f=false|isbn=9781400847761|pages=277.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the autumn of 1913, Pekmezi worked for the border commission in southern Albania and in March 1914 was appointed ''dragoman'' (interpreter/secretary) at the new [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro–Hungaria]]n mission in [[Durrës]]. In 1916, he was a leading member of the [[Albanian Literary Commission]] in Shkodër under the auspices of Austro–Hungary. In April 1917 he accompanied and facilitated the delegation of Albanian chieftains and leaders who visited Vienna and met with the Imperial authorities with an invitation by [[Ignaz Trollmann|Ignaz Freiherr Trollmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|language=Albanian|accessdate=2014-02-15| url=http://www.shqiptarja.com/m/home/prijesit-shqiptare-ne-vjenen-e-1917-fotot-dhe-portretet-fisnike-156401.html| publisher=shqiptarja.com (Rilindasi Supplement)| date=2013-05-13| title=Prijësit shqiptarë në Vjenën e 1917 Fotot dhe portretet fisnike|trans-title=Albanian leaders in Vienna of 1917 Noble photos and portraits}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1920 to 1924 and 1926 to 1928, he served as Albanian consul in Austria. In 1924 he published a new edition of [[Thimi Mitko]]'s ''Bleta Shqipëtare'' using the modern Albanian alphabet.{{sfn|Marcel Cornis-Pope|2007| p=355}} Pekmezi's work became at that time the best-known edition of ''Bleta Shqipëtare''. 

From 1928 until his death, he taught Albanian at the [[University of Vienna]].{{sfn|Elsie|2010|p=351}} The [[Albanology]] branch of the University of Vienna bears his name.&lt;ref name="Telegraf"&gt;{{citation|url=http://gazetatelegraf.com/gjergj-pekmezi-nder-intelektualet-me-te-kulturuar-te-kohes/| publisher=Gazeta Telegraf| language=Albanian| accessdate=2014-02-15| title=Gjergj Pekmezi, ndër intelektualët më të kulturuar të kohës|trans-title=Gjergj Pekmezi, among the most educated intellectuals of his time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2613">'''Gustave Fougères''' (24 April 1863, [[Baume-les-Dames]] ([[Doubs]]) – 7 December 1927, Paris, aged 64) was a French [[archaeologist]], spécialist of [[archaic Greece]].

== Biography ==
A student of the [[École normale supérieure]], he joined the [[French School at Athens]] in 1885. He explored [[Thessaly]] and [[Anatolia]] and searched the gymnasium of [[Delos]] (1886) and the ancient city of [[Mantineia]] with its elliptical rampart (1887–1888).

He taught in Lille and Paris, traveling through Greece repeatedly and published his ''Guide de la Grèce''.

In 1913, after he became director of the French School at Athens, he continued the excavations already begun at Delos, [[Thasos]] and [[Philippi]] and opened new sites in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and Anatolia ([[Claros]], [[Aphrodisias]]). Archaeological research in Greece were interrupted by First World War.

He taught archaeology at the [[Sorbonne]] from 1919. His courses attracted many foreign students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bch_0007-4217_1928_num_52_1_2913 Gustave Fougères (1863–1927)], {{Interlanguage link multi|Bulletin de correspondance hellénique|fr}}, 1928, vol. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rbph_0035-0818_1928_num_7_1_6505 Gustave Fougères], ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique'', obituary, 1928, vol. 7, (p.&amp;nbsp;394–395)&lt;/ref&gt;

:''To be distinguished from [[Heinrich Zimmer]] (1890–1943) German Indologist, and [[Heinrich Zimmer (Celticist)]] (1851–1910)''

{{Expand German|Heinrich Zimmern|date=July 2015}}
'''Heinrich Zimmern''' (14 July 1862 in [[Graben-Neudorf|Graben]] &amp;ndash; 17 February 1931 in [[Leipzig]], 1931) was a German [[Assyriologist]]. He was the first professor of Assyriology at [[Leipzig University]],&lt;ref&gt;Instituut voor Semitistiek en Archeologie van het Nabije Oosten - Page 27 J. H. Hospers - 1978 "5 Der erste Lehrstuhl fur Assyriologie wurde im Jahre 1900 in Leipzig mit der Berufung von H. Zimmern als ordentlicher Professor geschaffen, s. J. Oelsner, "Heinrich Zimmern (1862-1931)", in: Bedeutende Gelehrte in Leipzig, Band I, Leipzig ..."&lt;/ref&gt; and considered the founder of the discipline of the history of the [[ancient Near East]]ern religions in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfram Von Soden]] The Ancient Orient: An Introduction to the Study of the Ancient ... - Page xvii  1994 "From those scholars already at work at the turn of the century, to whom we are indebted even today, I would like to name as representative here only Heinrich Zimmern (1862-1931), the founder of the discipline of the history of ancient Near Eastern religions."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
From 1881 to 1885 he studied [[theology]] and [[Semitic languages]] at the universities of Leipzig and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], receiving his [[habilitation]] for Semitic languages in 1889 at the [[University of Königsberg]]. In 1894 he became an associate professor of Assyriology to the faculty of philosophy at Leipzig, where from 1900 to 1929 he served as a full professor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-leipzig.de/unigeschichte/professorenkatalog/leipzig/Zimmern_183/ Prof. Dr. phil.

[[David John Lewis|David Lewis]] (D-[[Maryland|MD]]).]]

The [[Social Security Act]] was enacted August 14, 1935. The Act was drafted during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term by the President's Committee on Economic Security, under [[Frances Perkins]], and passed by [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] as part of the [[New Deal]]. The Act was an attempt to limit what were seen as dangers in the modern American life, including old age, poverty, unemployment, and the burdens of widows and fatherless children. By signing this Act on August 14, 1935, President Roosevelt became the first president to advocate federal assistance for the elderly.&lt;ref name=Achenbaum&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew (1986). Social Security Visions and Revisions. New York: [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act provided benefits to retirees and the unemployed, and a [[Lump sum|lump-sum]] benefit at death. Payments to current retirees are financed by a [[payroll tax]] on current workers' wages, half directly as a payroll tax and half paid by the employer. The act also gave money to states to provide assistance to aged individuals (Title I), for unemployment insurance (Title III), [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (Title IV), Maternal and Child Welfare (Title V), public health services (Title VI), and the blind (Title X).&lt;ref name=Achenbaum/&gt;

==Origins and design==
The idea of a federally funded pension plan was popularized by [[Francis Townsend]] in 1933, and the influence of the "Townsend Plan" movement on debate over social security persisted into the 1950s.&lt;ref name="When"&gt;{{cite book |title=When Movements Matter: The Townsend Plan and the Rise of Social Security |last=Amenta|first=Edwin|authorlink= |year=2006|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location= |isbn=978-0691124735|pages=viii|accessdate=October 18, 2017 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AN5QukE1Qi0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22Midway+City%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rallied%20an%20astounding%20fifth%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheme"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/towns5.html |title=Research Note #17: The Townsend Plan's Pension Scheme |work=Research Notes &amp; Special Studies by the Historian's Office, Social Security Administration |author=Larry Dewitt |date=December 2001 |accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early debates on Social Security's design centered on how the program's benefits should be funded. Some believed that benefits to individuals should be funded by contributions that they themselves had made over the course of their careers. Others argued that this design would disadvantage those who had already begun their careers at the time of the program's implementation because they would not have enough time to accumulate adequate benefits.&lt;ref name=Schieber&gt;{{cite book|last=Schieber|first=Sylvester|title=The Predictable Surprise: The Unraveling of the U.S. Retirement System|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0199890958|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial opposition===
Social Security was controversial when originally proposed, with one point of opposition being that it would reduce the labor force, but supporters argued instead that retiring older workers would free up employment for young men, which during the Depression was a vital point of concern.

Opponents also decried the proposal as [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Finance, Business, Economics: Huge Old-Age Reserve Fund Under Doughton Bill Gives Treasury Extensive New Financial Powers; Could Be Used to Control Credit Also |work= The Washington Post |date= April 25, 1935 |page= 23 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/150734868/ |quote= "The social security bill, in its present form, is thus not only a sweeping piece of legislation, but also a far-reaching financial measure.

The existence of this huge reserve, furthermore, will constantly encourage resort to venture in State Socialism." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Security Bill's Passage Held Likely Monday: Hastings and Long Assail Measure; Few Changes Are Expected |first= Robert C. |last= Albright |work= The Washington Post |date= June 15, 1935 |page= 2 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/150634350/ |quote= "Senator [[Frederick Hale (US senator)|Frederick Hale]] (Republican), Maine, assailed the [Social Security] bill incidentally in the course of a speech in which he said President Roosevelt is filling Washington with 'socialistic agencies.'

Most women and minorities were excluded from the benefits of [[unemployment insurance]] and [[old age pensions]].&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Gwendolyn (1995). ''The Wages of Motherhood: Inequality in the Welfare State, 1917–1942''. Ithaca: [[Cornell University Press]]. p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Job categories that were not covered by the act included workers in agricultural labor, domestic service, government employees, and many teachers, nurses, hospital employees, librarians, and social workers.&lt;ref&gt;Quadagno, Jill (1994). ''The Color of Welfare: How Racism Undermined the War on Poverty''. New York: [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The act also denied coverage to individuals who worked intermittently.&lt;ref name=Kessler130&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice, 2001. pp. 130-1.&lt;/ref&gt; These jobs were dominated by women and minorities. For example, women made up 90 percent of domestic labor in 1940 and two-thirds of all employed black women were in domestic service.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice, 2001. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusions exempted nearly half of the working population.&lt;ref name=Kessler130/&gt; Nearly two-thirds of all African Americans in the labor force, 70 to 80 percent in some areas in the South, and just over half of all women employed were not covered by Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice, 2001. p.157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Katznelson&gt;Katznelson, Ira. ''When Welfare was White: The untold history of racial inequality in twentieth century America''. New York: W.W. Norton, 2005. pp. 43-8.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the [[NAACP]] protested the Social Security Act, describing it as "a sieve with holes just big enough for the majority of Negroes to fall through."&lt;ref name=Katznelson/&gt;

Some writers have suggested that this discrimination resulted from the powerful position of [[Southern Democrats]] on two of the committees pivotal for the Act's creation, the [[Senate Finance Committee]] and the [[House Ways and Means Committee]]. However, Larry DeWitt has refuted those arguments, showing there was no evidence for them. Indeed, southern Democrats in 1935 were generally liberal and strongly supported of the New Deal and Social Security.  They became much more conservative after 1937.{{Citation needed|reason=Implication from this sentence is unclear. Further clarification needs a reliable source. If this sentence remains ambiguous, consider striking for lacking clarity and reliability.|date=March 2017}} The Social Security law was very unpopular among many groups, especially farmers, who resented the additional taxes and feared they would never be made good. They lobbied hard for exclusion. Furthermore, the Treasury realized how difficult it would be to set up payroll deduction plans for farmers, for housekeepers who employed maids, and for nonprofit groups; therefore they were excluded. State employees were excluded for constitutional reasons (the federal government cannot tax state government). Federal employees were also excluded. Many textbooks, however, falsely indicate that the exclusions were the product of southern racial hostility toward blacks; there is no evidence of that in the record.&lt;ref&gt;Larry DeWitt, "The Decision to Exclude Agricultural and Domestic Workers from the 1935 Social Security Act." ''Social Security Bulletin'' (2010) 70#4 pp: 49-68. [http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n4/v70n4p49.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars have replicated and endorsed DeWitt's analysis, agreeing that the exclusions were made by policy experts on technical grounds and were not grounded on racial hostility.  Rodems and Shaefer note in all other countries unemployment insurance programs "excluded domestic and agricultural workers when they were first implemented, a fact that the key New Deal policy makers were well aware of."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rodems and H. Luke Shaefer, "Left Out: Policy Diffusion and the Exclusion of Black Workers from Unemployment Insurance." ''Social Science History'' 40.3 (2016): 385-404 quote p 385&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusions followed consultation with leading experts in Europe as well as the United States, including [[William Beveridge]], Henry Steel-Maitland, and R.C. Davison in Britain, Andre Tixier of the [[International Labour Organization]], and [[Edwin Witte]], [[Wilbur J. Cohen]], and Evelyn Burns in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rodems and Shaefer, "Left Out" p 401&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Security reinforced traditional views of family life.&lt;ref name=Mink&gt;Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood'', 1995. pp. 126-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Women generally qualified for benefits only through their husbands or children.&lt;ref name=Mink/&gt; Mothers' pensions (Title IV) based entitlements on the presumption that mothers would be unemployed.&lt;ref name=Mink/&gt;

Historical discrimination in the system can also be seen with regard to [[Aid to Dependent Children]]. Since this money was allocated to the states to distribute, some localities assessed black families as needing less money than white families. These low grant levels made it impossible for African American mothers to not work: one requirement of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, 1995, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states also excluded children born out of [[Marriage|wedlock]], an exclusion which affected African American women more than white women.&lt;ref&gt;Mink 1995, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; One study determined that 14.4% of eligible white individuals received funding, but only 1.5 percent of eligible black individuals received these benefits.&lt;ref name=Katznelson/&gt;

===Debates on the constitutionality of the Act===
In the 1930s, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] struck down many pieces of Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, including the [[Railroad Retirement Board|Railroad Retirement Act]].  The Social Security Act's similarity with the Railroad Retirement Act caused [[Edwin Witte]], the executive director of the President's Committee on Economic Security under Roosevelt who was credited as "the father of social security,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2520349|title = Edwin E. Witte (1887-1960): Father of Social Security|journal = Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume = 14|issue = 1|pages = 7|last1 = Cohen|first1 = Wilbur J|doi = 10.2307/2520349|year = 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; to question whether or not the bill would pass;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v18n10/v18n10p22.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; John Gall, an Associate Counsel for the National Association of Manufacturers who testified before the US House of Representatives in favor of the act, also felt that the bill was rushed through Congress too quickly and that the old age provision of the act was "hodgepodge" that needed to be written more properly in order to have a higher likelihood of being ruled constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/perkins6.html |title=Social Security Online |publisher=Ssa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court threw out a centerpiece of the New Deal, the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]], the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]], and New York State's [[minimum-wage]] law. President Roosevelt responded with an attempt to pack the court via the [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937]]. On February 5, 1937, he sent a special message to Congress proposing legislation granting the President new powers to add additional judges to all federal courts whenever there were sitting judges age 70 or older who refused to retire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourthistory.org/01_society/01.html Supremecourthistory.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006175022/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/01_society/01.html |date=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practical effect of this proposal was that the President would get to appoint six new Justices to the Supreme Court (and 44 judges to lower federal courts), thus instantly tipping the political balance on the Court dramatically in his favor. The debate on this proposal was heated and widespread, and lasted over six months. Beginning with a set of decisions in March, April, and May, 1937 (including the Social Security Act cases), the Court would sustain a series of New Deal legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/court.html |title=Social Security Administration |publisher=Ssa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] rulings affirmed the constitutionality of the Social Security Act.
* ''[[Steward Machine Company v. Davis]]'', 301 U.S, 548&lt;ref name="www.oyez.org.654"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Steward Machine Company vs. Davis'', 301 U.S, 548 |url=https://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/368/ |accessdate=December 3, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128231948/https://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/368/ |archivedate=November 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1937) held, in a 5–4 decision, that, given the exigencies of the [[Great Depression]], "[It] is too late today for the argument to be heard with tolerance that in a crisis so extreme the use of the moneys of the nation to relieve the unemployed and their dependents is a use for any purpose narrower than the promotion of the [[Common good|general welfare]]". The arguments opposed to the Social Security Act (articulated by justices [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Butler]], [[James Clark McReynolds|McReynolds]], and [[George Sutherland|Sutherland]] in their opinions) were that the social security act went beyond the powers that were granted to the federal government in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. They argued that, by imposing a tax on employers that could be avoided only by contributing to a state [[Unemployment benefit|unemployment-compensation]] fund, the federal government was essentially forcing each state to establish an unemployment-compensation fund that would meet its criteria, and that the federal government had no power to enact such a program.
* ''[[Helvering v. Davis]]'', 301 U.S. 619 (1937), decided on the same day as ''Steward'', upheld the program because "The proceeds of both [employee and employer] taxes are to be paid into the Treasury like internal-revenue taxes generally, and are not earmarked in any way". That is, the Social Security Tax was constitutional as a mere exercise of Congress's general taxation powers.

==Implementation==

The first reported Social Security payment was to Ernest Ackerman, a Cleveland motorman who retired only one day after Social Security began.&lt;ref name= ackerman&gt;{{cite news |title= First Age Pension Yields Beneficiary Profit of 12 Cents |work= Associated Press |publisher= The Washington Post |date= January 8, 1937 |page= 9 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/150950134/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five cents were withheld from his pay during that period, and he received a lump-sum payout of seventeen cents from Social Security.&lt;ref name= ackerman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html#firstcheck First Payments of Social Security], Social Security Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first monthly payment was issued on January 31, 1940 to [[Ida May Fuller]] of [[Ludlow (town), Vermont|Ludlow]], [[Vermont]].&lt;ref name= fuller&gt;{{cite news |title= Ida May Fuller, 100, of Vermont, Received First Social Security Check: Classmate of Calvin Coolidge |work= The Washington Post |date= January 31, 1975 |page= C4 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/146227490/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, 1938, and 1939, she paid a total of $24.75 into the Social Security System. Her first check was for $22.54.&lt;ref name= fuller/&gt; After her second check, Fuller already had received more than she contributed over the three-year period.

==Expansion and evolution==
{{Further|List of Social Security legislation (United States)}}
The provisions of Social Security have been changing since the 1930s, shifting in response to economic worries as well as concerns over changing gender roles and the position of minorities. Officials have responded more to the concerns of women than those of minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Social Security gradually moved toward universal coverage. By 1950, debates moved away from which occupational groups should be included to how to provide more adequate coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in Social Security have reflected a balance between promoting equality and efforts to provide adequate protection.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Achenbaum 1986. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, benefits paid totaled $35 million. These rose to $961 million in 1950, $11.2 billion in 1960, $31.9 billion in 1970, $120.5 billion in 1980, and $247.8 billion in 1990 (all figures in nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation). In 2004, $492 billion of benefits were paid to 47.5 million beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/pdf/2007historybooklet.pdf p. 19] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229061211/http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/pdf/2007historybooklet.pdf |date=December 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, nearly 51 million Americans received $650 billion in Social Security benefits.

The effects of Social Security took decades to manifest themselves. In 1950, it was reported that as many as 40% of Americans over 65 were still employed in some capacity, but by 1980 that figure had dropped to less than 20%. In 1990, fewer than 11% of Americans over 65 were still employed, an all-time low after which the number began to slowly rise again.

During the 1950s, over-65s continued to have the highest poverty rate of any age group in the US with the largest percentage of the nation's wealth concentrated in the hands of Americans under 35. By 2010, this figure had dramatically reversed itself with the largest percentage of wealth being in the hands of Americans aged 55–75 and those under 45 being among the poorest. Elder poverty, once a normal sight, had thus become rare by the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/17/AR2006031702088.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===1939 Amendment===

====Economic concerns====
One reason for the proposed changes in 1939 was a growing concern over the impact that the reserves created by the 1935 act were having on the economy. The [[Recession of 1937]] was blamed on the government, tied to the abrupt decrease in government spending and the $2 billion that had been collected in Social Security taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum 1986, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits became available in 1940 instead of 1942 and changes to the benefit formula increased the amount of benefits available to all recipients in the early years of Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum 1986, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; These two policies combined to shrink the size of the reserves. The original Act had conceived of the program as paying benefits out of a large reserve. This Act shifted the conception of Social Security into something of a hybrid system; while reserves would still accumulate, most early beneficiaries would receive benefits on the pay-as-you-go system.
Just as importantly, the changes also delayed planned rises in contribution rates. Ironically if these had been left in place they would have come into effect during the wartime boom in wages and would have arguably helped to temper wartime inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Berstein, Merton and Joan (1988). ''Social Security: The System That Works''. New York City: [[Basic Books]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creation of the Social Security Trust Fund====
The amendments established a [[Social Security Trust Fund|trust fund]] for any surplus funds. The managing [[trustee]] of this fund is the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]. The money could be invested in both non-marketable and marketable [[securities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/BudgetTreatment SSA.gov], budget treatment {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The move toward family protection====
Calls for reform of Social Security emerged within a few years of the 1935 Act. Even as early as 1936, some believed that women were not getting enough support. Worried that a lack of assistance might push women back into the work force, these individuals wanted Social Security changes that would prevent this. In an effort to protect the family, therefore, some called for reform which tied women's aid more concretely to their dependency on their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood'', 1995. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Others expressed apprehension about the complicated administrative practices of Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions''. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about the size of the reserve fund of the retirement program, emphasized by a recession in 1937, led to further calls for change.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum 1986, pp. 27, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

These amendments, however, avoided the question of the large numbers of workers in excluded categories.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the amendments of 1939 made family protection a part of Social Security. This included increased federal funding for the [[Aid to Dependent Children]] and raised the maximum age of children eligible to receive money under the Aid to Dependent Children to 18. The amendment added wives, elderly widows, and dependent survivors of covered male workers to those who could receive [[old age pensions]]. These individuals had previously been granted lump-sum payments upon only death or coverage through the Aid to Dependent Children program. If a married wage-earning woman's own benefit was worth less than 50% of her husband's benefit, she was treated as a wife, not a worker.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood'', 1995. pp. 135-6.&lt;/ref&gt; If a woman who was covered by Social Security died, however, her dependents were ineligible for her benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Since support for widows was dependent on the husband being a covered worker, African American widows were severely underrepresented and unaided by these changes.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood'', 1995. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to assure fiscal conservatives who worried about the costs of adding family protection policies, the benefits for single workers were decreased and lump-sum death payments were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

====FICA====
[[File:SocialSecurityposter2.gif|thumb|A poster for the expansion of the Social Security Act]]
In the original 1935 law, the benefit provisions were in Title II of the Act (which is why Social Security is sometimes referred to as the "Title II" program.) The taxing provisions were in a separate title (Title VIII) (for reasons related to the [[Social Security (United States)#Debates on the constitutionality of the Act|constitutionality of the 1935 Act]]).  As part of the 1939 Amendments, the Title VIII taxing provisions were taken out of the Social Security Act and placed in the Internal Revenue Code and renamed the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|Federal Insurance Contributions Act]] (FICA).  Social Security payroll taxes are thus often referred to as "FICA taxes."

===Amendments of the 1950s and 60s===
After years of debates about the inclusion of domestic labor, household employees working at least two days a week for the same person were added in 1950, along with nonprofit workers and the self-employed. Hotel workers, laundry workers, all agricultural workers, and state and local government employees were added in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris 2001. p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the tax rate was raised to 4.0 percent (2.0 percent for the employer, 2.0 percent for the employee) and disability benefits were added. Also in 1956, women were allowed to retire at 62 with benefits reduced by 25 percent. Widows of covered workers were allowed to retire at 62 without the reduction in benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris 2001, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BrochureUSSocialSecurity1961Pages1and4FormOAAN7006.jpg|thumb|Brochure from 1961 with basic advice about Social Security cards (pages 1 and 4)]]
[[File:BrochureUSSocialSecurity1961Pages2and3FormOAAN7006.jpg|thumb|Same brochure (pages 2 and 3)]]
In 1961, retirement at age 62 was extended to men, and the tax rate was increased to 6.0%.

In 1962, the changing role of the female worker was acknowledged when benefits of covered women could be collected by dependent husbands, widowers, and children. These individuals, however, had to be able to prove their [[Dependant (law)|dependency]].&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] were added in 1965 by the [[Social Security Act of 1965]], part of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s "[[Great Society]]" program.

In 1965, the age at which widows could begin collecting benefits was reduced to 60. Widowers were not included in this change. When [[divorce]], rather than death, became the major cause of marriages ending, divorcées were added to the list of recipients. Divorcées over the age of 65 who had been married for at least 20 years, remained unmarried, and could demonstrate dependency on their ex-husbands received benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government adopted a [[unified budget]] in the Johnson administration in 1968. This change resulted in a single measure of the fiscal status of the government, based on the sum of all government activity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/BudgetTreatment.html |title=SSA.gov |publisher=SSA.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surplus in Social Security trust funds offsets the total [[debt]], making it appear much smaller than it otherwise would. This allowed Congress to increase spending without having to risk the political consequences of raising taxes.

===Amendments of the 1970s===

====1972 Amendments====
In June 1972, both houses of the [[United States Congress]] approved by overwhelming majorities 20% increases in benefits for 27.8 million Americans. The average payment per month rose from $133 to $166. The bill also set up a [[cost-of-living]] adjustment (COLA) to take effect in 1975. This adjustment would be made on a yearly basis if the [[Consumer Price Index]] (CPI) increased by 3% or more.&lt;ref name=achenbaum58&gt;Achenbaum 1986. p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; This addition was an attempt to index benefits to [[inflation]] so that benefits would rise automatically. If inflation was 5%, the goal was to automatically increase benefits by 5% so their real value didn't decline. A technical error in the formula caused these adjustments to overcompensate for inflation, a technical mistake which has been called double-indexing. The COLAs actually caused benefits to increase at twice the rate of inflation.

In October 1972, a $5 billion piece of Social Security legislation was enacted which expanded the Social Security program. For example, minimum monthly benefits of individuals employed in low income positions for at least 30 years were raised. Increases were also made to the pensions of 3.8 million widows and dependent widowers.&lt;ref name=achenbaum58/&gt;

These amendments also established the [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI). SSI is not a Social Security benefit, but a welfare program, because the elderly and disabled poor are entitled to SSI regardless of work history. Likewise, SSI is not an entitlement, because there is no right to SSI payments.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, during the phase-in period of Social Security, Congress was able to grant generous benefit increases because the system had perpetual short-run surpluses. Congressional amendments to Social Security took place in even numbered years (election years) because the bills were politically popular, but by the late 1970s, this era was over. For the next three decades, projections of Social Security's finances would show large, long-term deficits, and in the early 1980s, the program flirted with immediate insolvency. From this point on, amendments to Social Security would take place in odd numbered years (years that were not election years) because Social Security reform now meant tax increases and benefit reductions. Social Security became known as the "Third Rail of American Politics." Touching it meant political death.

Several effects came together in the years following the 1972 amendments which rapidly changed the outlook on Social Security's long-term financial picture from positive to problematic. By the 1970s, the phase-in period, during which workers were paying taxes but few were collecting benefits, was largely over, and the ratio of elderly population to the working population was increasing. These developments brought questions about the capacity of the long term financial structure based on a pay-as-you-go program.

During the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, the economy suffered double-digit inflation, coupled with very high [[interest rates]], oil and energy crises, high unemployment and slow [[economic growth]]. [[Productivity growth]] in the United States had declined to an average annual rate of 1%, compared to an average annual rate increase of 3.2% during the 1960s. There was also a growing federal budget [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] which increased to $66 billion. The 1970s are described as a period of [[stagflation]], meaning economic stagnation coupled with price inflation, as well as higher interest rates. Price inflation (a rise in the general level of prices) creates uncertainty in budgeting and planning and makes labor strikes for pay raises more likely.
These underlying negative trends were exacerbated by a colossal mathematical error made in the 1972 amendments establishing the COLAs. The mathematical error which overcompensated for inflation was particularly detrimental given the double-digit inflation of this period, and the error led to benefit increases that were nowhere near financially sustainable.

The high inflation, double-indexing, and lower than expected wage growth was financial disaster for Social Security.

====1977 Amendments====
To combat the declining financial outlook, in 1977 Congress passed and Carter signed legislation fixing the double-indexing mistake. This amendment also altered the tax formulas to raise more money,&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum 1986, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; increasing withholding from 2% to 6.15%.&lt;ref name="'70s 324"&gt;{{Cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|page= 324|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With these changes, President Carter remarked, "Now this legislation will guarantee that from 1980 to the year 2030, the Social Security funds will be sound."&lt;ref&gt;Sylvester J. Schieber and John. B. Shoven, ''The Real Deal: the History and Future of Social Security''. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1999), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; This turned out not to be the case. The financial picture declined almost immediately and by the early 1980s, the system was again in crisis.

=== 1983 Amendments ===
After the 1977 amendments, the economic assumptions surrounding Social Security projections continued to be overly optimistic as the program moved toward a crisis. For example, COLAs were attached to increases in the CPI. This meant that they changed with prices, instead of wages. Before the 1970s, wage measurements exceeded changes in price. In the 1970s, however, this reversed and real wages decreased. This meant that FICA revenues could not keep up with the increasing benefits that were being given out. Continued high unemployment levels also lowered the amount of Social Security tax that could be collected. These two developments were decreasing the Social Security Trust Fund reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, projections indicated that the Social Security Trust Fund would run out of money by 1983, and there was talk of the system being unable to pay benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvester J. Schieber and John. B. Shoven, ''The Real Deal'', 1999, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Commission on Social Security Reform, chaired by [[Alan Greenspan]], was created to address the crisis.

The National Commission on Social Security Reform (NCSSR), chaired by [[Alan Greenspan]], was empaneled to investigate the long-run solvency of Social Security. The 1983 Amendments to the SSA were based on the NCSSR's Final Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the National Commission on Social Security Reform |url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/gspan.html |accessdate= March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCSSR recommended enacting a six-month delay in the COLA and changing the tax-rate schedules for the years between 1984 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; It also proposed an income tax on the Social Security benefits of higher-income individuals. This meant that benefits in excess of a household income threshold, generally $25,000 for singles and $32,000 for couples (the precise formula computes and compares three different measures) became taxable. These changes were important for generating revenue in the short term.

Also of concern was the long-term prospect for Social Security because of demographic considerations. Of particular concern was the issue of what would happen when people born during the [[post–World War II baby boom]] retired. The NCSSR made several recommendations for addressing the issue.&lt;ref name="www.ssa.gov.656"&gt;{{cite web| title=Chapter 2 of the 1983 Greenspan Commission on Social Security Reform | url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/gspan5.html | accessdate=March 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 1983 amendments to Social Security, a previously enacted increase in the payroll tax rate was accelerated, additional employees were added to the system, the full-benefit retirement age was slowly increased, and up to one-half of the value of the Social Security benefit was made potentially taxable income.&lt;ref name="www.ssa.gov.657"&gt;{{cite web| title=Research Notes &amp; Special Studies by the Historian's Office | url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/taxationofbenefits.html | accessdate=March 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social Security Trust Fund ====
The 1983 Amendments also included a provision to exclude the [[Social Security Trust Fund]] from the [[unified budget]] (to take it "[[off-budget]]."{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}) Yet today Social Security is treated like all the other trust funds of the Unified Budget.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

As a result of these changes, particularly the tax increases, the Social Security system began to generate a large short-term surplus of funds, intended to cover the added retirement costs of the "[[baby boomer]]s." Congress invested these surpluses into special series, non-marketable U.S. [[Treasury securities]] held by the Social Security Trust Fund. Under the law, the government bonds held by Social Security are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

==The Supreme Court and the evolution of Social Security==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has established that no one has any legal right to Social Security benefits. The Court decided, in ''[[Flemming v. Nestor]]'' (1960), that "entitlement to Social Security benefits is not a contractual right". In that case, Ephram Nestor, a Bulgarian immigrant to the United States who made contributions for covered wages for the statutorily required "quarters of coverage" was nonetheless denied benefits after being deported in 1956 for being a member of the Communist party.

The case specifically held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
2. A person covered by the Social Security Act has not such a right in old-age benefit payments as would make every defeasance of "accrued" interests violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 608–611. (a) The noncontractual interest of an employee covered by the Act cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity, whose right to benefits are based on his contractual premium payments. Pp. 608–610. (b) To engraft upon the Social Security System a concept of "accrued property rights" would deprive it of the flexibility and [363 U.S. 603, 604] boldness in adjustment to ever-changing conditions which it demands and which Congress probably had in mind when it expressly reserved the right to alter, amend or repeal any provision of the Act. Pp. 610–611. 3. Section 202 (n) of the Act cannot be condemned as so lacking in rational justification as to offend due process. Pp. 611–612. 4. Termination of appellee's benefits under 202 (n) does not amount to punishing him without a trial, in violation of Art. III, 2, cl. 3, of the Constitution or the Sixth Amendment; nor is 202 (n) a [[bill of attainder]] or ex post facto law, since its purpose is not punitive. Pp. 612–621.[65]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Supreme Court was also responsible for major changes in Social Security. Many of these cases were pivotal in changing the assumptions about differences in wage earning among men and women in the Social Security system.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Goldberg v. Kelly]] (1970): The Supreme Court ruled that the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] required there to be an evidentiary hearing before a recipient can be deprived of government benefits.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7" /&gt;
* [[Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld]] (1975):  Stephen Wiesenfeld was a widower who claimed that he was entitled to his deceased wife's benefit. Before this case a widow and her children were eligible for her husband's Social Security benefits; however, if a wife died only her children and not the widower could receive benefits. Wiesenfeld believed that this violated his right to equal protection under the due process clause of the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]. The court upheld his claims, stating that automatically granting widows the benefits and denying them to widowers violated [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dates of coverage for various workers==
* 1935 All workers in commerce and industry (except railroads) under age 65.
* 1939 Age restriction eliminated; seamen, bank employees added; additional [[domestic worker]]s and food-processing workers removed
* 1946 Railroad and Social Security earnings combined to determine eligibility for and amount of survivor benefits.

Nonprofit organizations could elect coverage for their employees (other than ministers).
* 1951 Railroad workers with less than 10 years of service, for all benefits. (After October 1951, coverage is retroactive to 1937.)
* 1954 Farm self-employed. Professional self-employed except lawyers, dentists, doctors, and other medical groups. Additional regularly employed farm and domestic workers. Homeworkers. State and local government employees (except firemen and policemen) under retirement system if agreed to by referendum. Ministers could elect coverage as self-employed.

'''''Hotel Lobby''''' is an [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] by American [[Realist visual arts|realist]] painter [[Edward Hopper]]; it is held in the collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (IMA), in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], United States.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=Hotel Lobby | work=Collections | publisher =[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] | url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/hotel-lobby-hopper-edward | accessdate = 14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The painting depicts two women and a man in the lobby of a hotel. On the right is a woman with blond hair and a blue dress, sitting with her legs crossed and reading a book. To the left sits an older woman with a red dress, a coat and a hat. A man stands next to her, facing forward, with a suit on and an overcoat draped over his right arm. On the left wall, above the woman, is a framed landscape painting. A clerk behind the reception desk is barely visible in the shadows.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt;

==Context==

''Hotel Lobby'' is a signature piece in Hopper's work, displaying his classic themes of [[wiktionary:alienation|alienation]] and [[wiktionary:brevity|brevity]].&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt; The Hoppers traveled frequently, staying in many motels and hotels throughout his career. This is one of two works in his catalog that depicts a hotel, the other being ''Hotel Window'' (1955). The older couple are believed to represent Hopper and his wife, at that date in their 60s.&lt;ref name="Warkel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Warkel |first=Harriet G. |coauthors= |title=Paper to Paint: Edward Hopper's ''Hotel Lobby'' |publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] |year=2009 |month= |isbn=978-0-936260-84-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel guests have been described as being "both traveling and suspended in time,"&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt; reflecting a stoic and dramatic feeling, reminiscent of the [[film noir]] movies Hopper might have seen and the complex structure and feeling of works by [[Edgar Degas]]. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper Detail 2.JPG| thumb| Light detail]] --&gt;
The painting utilizes harsh light and rigid lines to create a "carefully constructed" uncomfortable environment. The elevated and [[theatrical]] [[wikt:vantage point|vantage point]] of the painting may be derived from Hopper's love of [[Broadway theatre]] which he often watched from the balcony.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt;

===Sketches===

Before he created the ''Hotel Lobby'' Hopper drew ten studies of the work, which are in the collection of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], as a gift for his wife, Josephine.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtistPanel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meyerowitz |first1=Joel |last2=Segal |first2=George |last3=Bailey |first3=William |last4=Levin |first4=Gail |year=1981 |title=Artists' Panel |journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]] |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=151–153 |publisher=[[College Art Association]] |doi= |jstor=776464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndianapolisMonth1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Indianapolis Museum of Art |journal=[[Indianapolis Monthly]] |volume= |issue=September |pages=170 |publisher=[[Emmis Communications]] |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of the ten studies are described as:

*Study one was believed to have been executed while Hopper in a hotel lobby observed two seated figures separated by a lamp and table. That wall features a curtained opening, a registration desk and a painting on the wall with the stairwell and railing on the left.
*Study two lacks the table and lamp and includes a second painting, which is separated from the other by a wall sconce, and one figure.
*Study three depicts the stairwell being moved into the background. A figure believed to be male stands in the open doorway to the left of the stairs while a woman sits to the left of the doorway with an empty chair, a painting on the wall and a tiled floor.
*Study four is more refined and has greater detail. The stairs are now removed with three people on the left: two seated figures next to a standing man. The rear doorway has a curtain, columns are on the reception desk, the ceiling appears to be beamed, a second painting is on the wall and a stripe is added to the floor.
*Study five is double sided. One side appears to be an abandoned diagram of a room. The reverse side shows the room with a more detailed revolving door and a return to a single, framed painting on the wall. The reception desk columns are more detailed, and the stripe on the floor is darkened.
*Study six is missing the seated figure from the left with only three remaining and in more detail. The figures and the elevator are in their final locations.
*Study seven shows the fourth figure reappearing by the couple. The ceiling, desk, revolving door, curtained doorway and elevator all have greater detail. The couple also appears to be having a conversation.
*Study eight was created to further detail the older woman's clothing and hands, showing her with a gold [[glove]].
*Study nine is a partial sketch of the younger woman who is reading, which shares the page with sketch eight, in greater detail. Until this sketch the other seated figure was a man.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;

These studies show the older couple communicating, only to cease their conversation in the final painting and reading man is replaced with a blonde young woman reading in the final painting.&lt;ref name="Saetre"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fame is no cure for fear, Hopper exhibit shows |author=Julie Cope Saetre |url=http://assets3.indy.com/posts/10478 |newspaper=Indy.com |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=14 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724055209/http://assets3.indy.com/posts/10478 |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modeling for both women in the painting was done by his wife Josephine. After their marriage in 1920 she insisted on being the model for all of his female figures.&lt;ref name="Elovich"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elovich |first1=Richard |last2= |first2= |year=1981 |title=London.

The coat the older woman wears is based on a [[fur coat]] owned by Hopper's wife, a coat she often wore to openings and a rare find in the Hopper's frugal household. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper Detail 1.JPG| thumb|left| Woman in red detail]] --&gt;
The red dress that the older woman wears (that Jo, in her journal, describes as "coral") signifies anger and extroversion, while the blue dress worn by the younger woman shows youth and distance. Throughout Hopper's sketches the clerk does not appear until the final painting. Under X-ray it can be seen that Hopper did little to change the canvas once he began work. Most alterations were made in the position of the young woman's head and in outlines of some areas in dark blue paint. A partial underdrawing was found but little detail remains.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper Detail 4.JPG| thumb| |Hopper detail]] --&gt;
Hopper was known to model for himself for figures, as in ''Nighthawks'', leading some to believe he may have modeled for the male figure in ''Hotel Lobby''.

One of the few paintings by Hopper to lack windows, ''Hotel Lobby'' utilizes light from the revolving door and an unseen area from between the ceiling beams.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;

==Reception==

In 1945 Hopper was awarded the [[Logan Medal of the Arts]] and a $500 [[honorarium]] for ''Hotel Lobby''.&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levin |first=Gail |coauthors= |title=Edward Hopper: An intimate biography |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=1998 |month= |isbn=0-520-21475-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtInstitute1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levin |first1=Gail |last2=Hopper |first2=Edward |year=1996 |title=Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks", Surrealism, and the War |journal=Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=195 |publisher=[[Art Institute of Chicago]] |doi= |jstor=4104321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was chosen by a jury composed of [[Juliana Force]], then director of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]], and artists [[Raphael Soyer]] and [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]].&lt;ref name="ArtInstitute1"/&gt; In regards to the painting, Chicago critic [[Clarence Joseph Bulliet|C.J. Bulliet]] stated that "Mr. Hopper is getting a little lazy about the excellent formula he has hit. ''Hotel Lobby'' is typical Hopper, but Hopper that has lost something of its kick."&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt; The artwork has been compared to Hopper's earlier work ''Summer Interior'' (1909), a work that helped to create Hopper's signature style; an intimate setting, simple lines and geometry, flat color usage and moody light. A shadowy figure and a sensual woman each make another visit in ''Hotel Lobby'' as seen in ''Summer Interior''.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;

==Ownership and exhibition history==
The painting was in the collection of Henry Hope from [[Bloomington, Indiana]].&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt;

From June until December 2006 the Whitney Museum, which has the largest holding of Hopper's works in the world, displayed ''Hotel Lobby'' alongside their own works and key loans such as ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) and ''New York Movie'' (1939).&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Edward Hopper | work=Exhibitions | publisher=Whitney Museum of American Art | url=http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/EdwardHopper | accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hoppers Come and Go In a Whitney Show |author=Carol Vogel |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=6 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronnen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiroche sale opens tomorrow |author=Meir Ronnen |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=7 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hotel Lobby'' is currently on display in the Indianapolis Museum of Art's [[American scene painting|American Scene]] Gallery.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt; In 2008 the IMA exhibited the work alongside the ten studies on loan from the Whitney in ''Edward Hopper: Paper to Paint'', which ran until January 2009.&lt;ref name="IndianapolisMonth1"/&gt;

===Publications===

In 1996 ''Hotel Lobby'' was used as the paperback cover for the book ''Hotel Paradise'' by [[Martha Grimes]].&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grimes |first=Martha |coauthors= |title=Hotel Paradise |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=1996 |month= |isbn=978-0-345-39425-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting also appears in ''City Limits: Crime, consumer culture and the urban experience'' by [[Keith Hayward]].&lt;ref name="Hayward"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayward |first=Keith |coauthors= |title=City limits: Crime, consumer culture and the urban experience |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |year=2004 |month= |isbn=1-904385-03-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ink brushes''' ({{Zh|t=毛筆|s=毛笔|p=máo bǐ}}; {{lang-ja|筆|fude}}; {{lang-ko|붓/筆}}) are used in [[Chinese calligraphy]] as well as [[Japanese calligraphy]] and [[Korean calligraphy]] which have a root of Chinese calligraphy. They are also used in [[Chinese painting]] and other [[brush painting]] styles. The brush was invented in China around 300 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ong|first=Siew Chey|title=China condensed: 5000 years of history &amp; culture|year=2005|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=Singapore|isbn=978-981-261-067-6|pages=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bt7q8hfiZ4gC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women of China, Issues 1-6|year=1995|publisher=Foreign Language Press|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nJWyAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[inkstone]], [[inkstick]] and [[Xuan paper]], these four writing implements form the [[Four Treasures of the Study]].

Brushes differ greatly in terms of size, texture, material, and cost. The brush hair chosen depends on one's needs at the moment; certain kinds of brushes are more suited to certain [[East asian script styles |script styles ]] and individuals than others. 
* '''Handle''': usually of bamboo, exotic brushes may instead use such materials as gold, silver, jade, ivory, [[red sandalwood]] or [[spotted bamboo]].
* '''Hair source''': normally the brush is made from goat, [[Siberian weasel]] (ch: 黄鼠狼 huángshǔláng, yellow-rat-wolf), pig, mouse, [[domestic buffalo|buffalo]], wolf, or rabbit hair, while exotic ones can be made from tiger, [[fowl]], deer, and even human hair (from a baby's first haircut, said to bring good fortune while taking the [[imperial examination]]s).
* '''Hair texture''': soft (ch: 軟毫 ruǎnháo), mixed (ch: 兼毫 jiānháo), or hard (ch: 硬毫 yìngháo) hair.
*'''Hair size''': generally classified as either big (ch: 大楷 dàkǎi, ja: 大筆 oofude), medium (ch: 中楷 zhōngkǎi, ja: 中筆 chufude), or small (ch: 小楷 xiǎokǎi, ja: 小筆 kofude)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =莫山 |last =榊 |title =文房四宝 筆の話 |date =1981-05-30 |publisher =角川書店 |edition =1 |page =202}}&lt;/ref&gt;; most calligraphy is written with a medium-sized brush. The smallest brushes are used for very small pieces and for fashioning designs for seals. While medium size brushes are the most widely used, wielded by a skilled artist a medium brush can produce a variety of thicknesses of line from very thin to fairly thick. The largest brushes are used only for very large pieces.
*'''Hair length''': generally classified by hair length for thickness of handle as either long (ja: 長鋒 chouhou), medium (ja: 中鋒 chuhou), short (ja: 短鋒　tannhou); most calligraphy is written with a medium-length hair brush. The long hair brush are more keep to hold a ink than the short hair brushes as their length. So, it used for continuous long stroke line scripting such as Japanese traditional ''hiragana'' style by ''rennmen''( ja: 連綿 ). The hair of long hair brushes are tend to made by hard texture hair to keep their hair form, but there is a not one. Japanese very long and slender hair brushes called ''menso''-burushes（ ja: 面相筆 ） are used for detail painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =久夫　|last =堀 |title =書筆使いこなしハンドブック |date =2001-03-16 |publisher =可成屋 |edition =1 |isbn =4-8393-8721-4 |page =128}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Synthetic hair is not traditionally used. Prices vary greatly depending on the quality of the brush; cheap brushes cost less than one US dollar while expensive brushes can cost more than a thousand dollars. Currently, the finest brushes are made in the town of [[Shanlian]], in the [[Nanxun District]], [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Huzhou]], of [[Zhejiang]] province.

==History==
[[File:Pinceaux chinois.jpg|thumb|Brushes of various sizes and types of hair, including one of chicken feathers at the top]]
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The earliest intact ink brush was found in 1954 in the tomb of a [[Chu (state)|Chu]] citizen from the [[Warring States period]] (475-221 [[Common Era|BCE]]) located in an archaeological dig site ''Zuo Gong Shan 15'' near [[Changsha]] (長沙). The primitive version of an ink brush found had a wooden stalk and a bamboo tube securing the bundle of hair to the stalk. Legend wrongly credits the invention of the ink brush to the later [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] general [[Meng Tian]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Traces of the writing brush, however, were discovered on the Shang jades, and were suggested to be the grounds of the oracle bone inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of Ancient China, 1999:108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fudepen==
{{see also|Fudepen}}

The '''Fudepen''', also known as a "Brush Pen", is a modern Japanese invention analogous to a [[Fountain pen]]. Today, Japanese companies such as [[Pentel]] and [[Sakura Color Products Corporation]] manufacture pens with tips resembling those of a small ink brush. These brush pens work almost identically to small ink brushes and can be used for most of the same purposes.

'''Islamic miniatures''' are small [[painting]]s on [[paper]], usually book or manuscript illustrations but also sometimes separate artworks. The earliest examples date from around 1000 AD, with a flourishing of the artform from around 1200 AD. The field is divided by scholars into four types, [[Arabic miniature|Arabic]],  [[Mughal painting|Mughal (Indian)]],  [[Ottoman miniature|Ottoman (Turkish)]], and  [[Persian miniature|Persian]].&lt;ref name=DavidCollection&gt;{{cite web |title=Miniature Painting |url=https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/materials/miniatures |publisher=The David Collection |accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MMA1933"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Islamic Miniature Painting and Book Illumination|journal=Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=October 1933|volume=28|issue=10|pages=166–171|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3255467.pdf.bannered.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''John Templeton Foundation''' ('''Templeton Foundation''') is a philanthropic organization that reflects the ideas of its founder, [[John Templeton]], who became wealthy after a career as a [[Contrarian investing|contrarian investor]] and wanted to support progress in religious and spiritual knowledge, especially at the intersection of religion and science. He also wanted to fund research on methods to promote and develop [[moral character]], intelligence, and creativity in people, and to promote free markets.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt; In 2016 ''Inside Philathropy'' called it "the oddest — or most interesting — big foundation around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Tate |title=Templeton Remains the Oddest—or Most Interesting—Big Foundation Around |url=https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2016/4/5/templeton-remains-the-oddestor-most-interestingbig-foundatio.html |work=Inside Philanthropy |date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Templeton founded the organization in 1987 and ran it until his death in 2008.  Templeton's son [[John Templeton, Jr.]] ran it until his death in 2015, at which point Templeton, Jr.'s daughter, Heather Templeton Dill, became president.

The foundation administers the annual [[Templeton Prize]] for achievements in the field of spirituality, including those at the intersection of science and religion.  It has an extensive grant-funding program (around $70M per year as of 2011) aimed at supporting notions associated with [[classical liberalism]], like "character development", "freedom and free enterprise", and "exceptional cognitive talent and genius".  It funded work in [[intelligent design]] in the 1990s but then abandoned that activity after it faced sharp criticism from the mainstream scientific community in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

Many scholars have raised concerns about the biased nature of the awards, research projects and publications backed by the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Libby A. Nelson.

According to Lecointre, this type of private funding would be "disastrous for the autonomy of scientific research".&lt;ref name=CNRS&gt;{{cite web|title=La Fondation Templeton, les formes présentables du créationnisme philosophique : des initiatives " science et religions " pour dissoudre les limites entre le collectif et l'individuel, entre le public et le privé|url=http://www.cnrs.fr/cw/dossiers/dosevol/decouv/articles/chap1/lecointre5.html|author=Guillaume Lecointre|publisher=[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Center for Scientific Research]]|quote=très lié au fondamentalisme protestant ...

==Leadership==
[[John Templeton]] (29 November 1912 – 8 July 2008) was an American-born British [[investor]], banker, [[Asset management|fund manager]], and philanthropist. In 1954, he entered the [[Mutual fund|mutual fund market]] and created the [[Franklin Templeton Investments|Templeton Growth Fund]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/business/09templeton-cnd.html|title=Sir John M. Templeton, Philanthropist, Rockstar, Dies at 95|date=9 July 2000|first=Robert D.|last=McFadden}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 profile of the foundation: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like many of his generation, Templeton was a great believer in progress, learning, initiative and the power of human imagination — not to mention the free-enterprise system that allowed him, a middle-class boy from Winchester, Tennessee, to earn billions of dollars on Wall Street. ... Unlike most of his peers, however, Templeton thought that the principles of progress should also apply to religion. He described himself as "an enthusiastic Christian" — but was also open to learning from Hinduism, Islam and other religious traditions. Why, he wondered, couldn't religious ideas be open to the type of constructive competition that had produced so many advances in science and the free market?.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These were the values he sought to promote first through the [[Templeton Prize]] which he started in 1972 and then through the foundation, which he founded in 1987 and ran until his death in 2008.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

[[John M. Templeton, Jr.]] worked as a pediatric surgeon; he was chief of pediatric surgery at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 1995 when he stopped practicing medicine and joined the foundation. He took over the leadership when his father died. He was an [[evangelical Christian]] and supported various [[American conservatism|American conservative]] causes.&lt;ref name=NYT2015&gt;{{cite news |title=John M.

Heather Templeton Dill, the daughter of John Templeton, Jr., became president in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People in the News (8/02/15): Appointments and Promotions|url=http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/people-in-the-news-8-02-15-appointments-and-promotions|newspaper=Philanthropy News Digest|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endowment==
As of 2011, the foundation had an endowment of around $2.1 billion.  Around $500 million of that was a bequest from John Templeton when he died in 2008.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

==Prizes==
{{main|Templeton Prize}}
The Templeton Prize was established by [[John Templeton]] and he administered the prize until the foundation was established in 1987, which took it over.&lt;ref name=Nature2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waldrop |first1=M. Mitchell |title=Religion: Faith in science |journal=Nature |date=17 February 2011 |volume=470 |issue=7334 |pages=323–325 |doi=10.1038/470323a}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11745591 |work = The Economist| title= Obituary – John Templeton | accessdate=July 2, 2009|date=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early prizes were given solely to people who had made great achievements in the field of religion; Mother Teresa received the inaugural award in 1973.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt; In the 1980's Templeton began considering the intersection of science and religion, and after he appointed to scientists to the judging panel, scientists who worked at the intersection began receiving it; [[Alister Hardy]] was the first, in 1987.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

==Funding==
Templeton believed in capitalism and in competition in all things.  Around 40% of grants are given in fields associated with [[classical liberalism]], like "character development", "freedom and free enterprise", and "exceptional cognitive talent and genius", and also across all religions, since Templeton believed progress in the field of spirituality could come from anywhere.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

The field of grants was broadened in the 1980s to include scientific fields like neuroscience, psychology, and cosmology, that could be seen as being at the intersection of science and religion.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;  In the 1990s the foundation funded people and organizations in the field of [[intelligent design]]; the foundation was frequently described as a major supporter of intelligent design during the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] litigation in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt; In the late 2000s, in the aftermath of its public shaming and loss of credibility among mainstream scientists, the foundation changed its grant topics to reduce the emphasis on religion and increase the emphasis on science and explicitly discouraged intelligent design proposals on its grant-application website.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

The top ten grants as of 2011 were:&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;
# Foundational Questions in Evolutionary Biology ($10,500,000)
# Foundational Questions in Physics and Cosmology ($8,812,078)
# The SEVEN Fund: Enterprise Based Solutions to Poverty ($8,742,911)
# Establishing an Institute for Research on Unlimited Love ($8,210,000)
# The Purpose Prize for Social Innovators Over the Age of 60 ($8,148,322)
# Templeton–Cambridge Journalism Fellowships and Seminars in Science and Religion ($6,187,971)
# Accelerating Progress at the Interface of Positive Psychology and Neuroscience ($5,816,793)
# AAAS Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion ($5,351,707)
# Promoting a Culture of Generosity, Part I: Feature Film ($5,000,000)
# Promoting a Culture of Generosity, Part II: The Philanthropy Channel ($5,000,000)

===American conservatism===

Like all [[501(c)(3)]] organizations, the Templeton Foundation is prohibited from engaging directly in political activity. However, a number of journalists have highlighted connections with conservative causes. A 1997 article in ''[[Slate Magazine]]'' said the Templeton Foundation had given a significant amount of financial support to groups, causes and individuals considered [[American conservatism|conservative]], including gifts to [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Walter E. Williams]], [[Julian Lincoln Simon]] and [[Mary Lefkowitz]], and referred to John Templeton, Jr., as a "conservative sugar daddy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plotz |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1822/ |title=God's Venture Capitalist |publisher=Slate.com |date=1997-06-08 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation also has a history of supporting the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think-tank, as well as projects at major research centers and universities that explore themes related to [[free market economics]], such as [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]]'s [[Institute for Liberty and Democracy|Instituto Libertad Y Democracia]] and the [[X Prize Foundation]].

In a 2007 article in ''[[The Nation]]'', [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] drew attention to the Foundation's president John M. Templeton Jr. funding of the conservative group [[Freedom's Watch]], and referred to the Foundation as a "right wing venture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/john-templetons-universe |title=John Templeton's Universe |publisher=The Nation |date=2007-10-10 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pamela Thompson of the Templeton Foundation, responding to Ehrenreich's allegations, asserted that "the Foundation is, and always has been, run in accordance with the wishes of Sir John Templeton Sr, who laid very strict criteria for its mission and approach", that it is "a non-political entity with no religious bias" and it "is totally independent of any other organisation and therefore neither endorses, nor contributes to political candidates, campaigns, or movements of any kind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Right's Academic Universe|url=http://ehrenreich.blogs.com/barbaras_blog/2007/10/the-rights-acad.html|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change denial===

In 2013 it was highlighted that the Templeton Foundation has been funding the [[climate change denial]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacPherson|first=Diana|date=26 December 2013|title=Templeton funds climate-change denialist groups|url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/templeton-funds-climate-change-denialist-groups/|website=Why Evolution is True}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligent design===

In the 1990s organizations funded by the foundation gave grants for writing books to [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]] and to [[William Dembski]] who are proponents of [[intelligent design]] and who both joined the [[Discovery Institute]].&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dembski |first1=William A. |title=Being as Communion: A Metaphysics of Information |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317175445 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wYHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also gave money directly to the Discovery Institute which in turn passed it through to Baylor University, which used the funds to support Dembski's salary at the short-lived [[Michael Polanyi Center]] at Baylor,&lt;ref name=Trojan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forrest |first1=Barbara |last2=Gross |first2=Paul R. |title=Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design |date=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195319736 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mMSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA306#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|306}}&lt;ref name=wedgeatwork&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gross |first1=Barbara |title=The Wedge at Work |url=https://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/wedge-at-work |work=NCSE |date=3 December 2008 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a major step forward in the Discovery Institute's [[wedge strategy]], in that it established a beachhead for intelligent design within a major US university.&lt;ref name=wedgeatwork/&gt; [[Bruce L. Gordon]], another intelligent design proponent, was associate director of the center, and the foundation continued to fund his projects at Baylor after the center was dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Final In Series Of Science And Faith Lectures To Be Held April 22–23 |url=https://www.baylor.edu/mediacommunications/news.php?action=story&amp;story=7161 |work=Media Communications {{!}} Baylor University |date=19 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other grants supported a conference around 2000 that put proponents of intelligent design on an equal footing with scientists.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

In 2005 the foundation was frequently described as a major supporter of intelligent design during the widely discussed [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] litigation in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;  The foundation, through Charles L. Harper Jr., its senior vice president for research, disputed that characterization, saying that while the foundation had initially been sympathetic to intelligent design, it had since grown disillusioned.&lt;ref name=NYT2005&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goodstein |first1=Laurie |title=Intelligent Design Might Be Meeting Its Maker |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/weekinreview/intelligent-design-might-be-meeting-its-maker.html |work=New York Times |date=December 4, 2005 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He told ''BusinessWeek'' that the foundation had become one of the "principal critics" of the intelligent design movement and funded projects that challenged it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_48/b3961617.htm |title=Bloomberg Business |publisher=Businessweek.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and told the ''New York Times'': "From the point of view of rigor and intellectual seriousness, the intelligent design people don't come out very well in our world of scientific review".&lt;ref name=NYT2005/&gt;

A 2007 article in the ''Los Angeles Times'' described the foundation as having "drawn criticism for its early support of intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Iritani |first1=Evelyn |title=Testing the role of trust and values in financial decisions |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/21/business/fi-values21 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=21 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the Discovery Institute accused the foundation of blocking its involvement in ''[[Biological Evolution: Facts and Theories]]'', a Vatican-backed, Templeton-funded conference in Rome. On the lack of involvement of any speakers supporting intelligent design, the conference director Rev. Marc Leclerc said, "We think that it's not a scientific perspective, nor a theological or philosophical one ... This makes a dialogue difficult, maybe impossible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2009/03/vaticanbacked_rome_conference.html |title=Vatican-backed Rome conference on evolution snubs intelligent-design and creationist groups |publisher=cleveland.com |date=2009-03-05 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion and medicine ===

[[Harold Koenig]], [[Dale Mathews]], David Larson, [[Jeffrey Levin]], [[Herbert Benson]] and [[Michael McCullough (psychologist)|Michael McCullogh]] are scholars to whom Templeton have provided funds to "report the positive relations" between [[Religion and health|religion and medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/blindfaithunholy00sloa|title=Blind faith : the unholy alliance of religion and medicine|last=Sloan|first=Richard P.|date=2006|publisher=New York : St. Martin's Press|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{pov section|date=November 2018}}
===Critiques from the French National Center for Scientific Research===
Giullaume Lecointre of the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Center for Scientific Research]] (CNRS) has been scathingly critical of the Templeton Foundation, calling its type of private founding "disastrous for the autonomy of scientific research", as the French Center considers it aligned to fundamentalist Protestantism, creationism, and aimed at the dissolution of the [[epistemology|epistemological]] distinction between the collective and public [[empirical knowledge|empirical]] enquiry and the individual and private [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] convictions.&lt;ref name=CNRS/&gt;

{{quote|''... Mais ce choix ne saurait en rien constituer un projet collectif de connaissance objective. Les connaissances empiriques, universellement testables, constituent la partie de nos savoirs qui unissent les hommes, et c'est pour cela qu'elles sont politiquement publiques. Les options métaphysiques restent personnelles et politiquement privées car elles peuvent diviser les hommes et donc devenir dans le champ politique une source d'oppression.''&lt;br&gt; ... But this choice [the promotion of individual metaphysical opinions] will not be able at all to constitute a collective project of objective knowledge. Empirical knowledge, universally testable, forms the part of our knowledge which unites humanity, and it is for this reason politically public. Metaphysical opinions remain personal and politically private since they can divide humanity and thus become, within the political field, a source of oppression.|CNRS&lt;ref name=CNRS/&gt;}}

===Critiques from individual scholars===
The Foundation's views on the connections between religious and scientific inquiry and their ability to provide significant grants for scientific research has led to a polarising debate within the scientific community.

====Chris Mooney====
Science journalist Chris Mooney, an atheist and author of ''The Republican War on Science'', received a 2010 Templeton-Cambridge Journalism Fellowship, enabling him to join other journalists for a three-week lecture program on science and religion at Cambridge University. In a 2010 article on his ''Discover'' magazine blog, Mooney wrote, "I can honestly say that I have found the lectures and presentations that we've heard here to be serious and stimulating. The same goes for the discussions that have followed them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mooney|first=Chris|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/06/07/science-and-religion-on-the-cam-part-i/#more-8792|title=Science and Religion on the Cam, Part I|website=Doscover|date=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Horgan, a 2005 Templeton-Cambridge fellow then working as a freelance science journalist, wrote in ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' that he had enjoyed his fellowship, but felt guilty that by taking money from the Templeton Foundation, he had contributed to the mingling of science with religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnhorgan.org/the_templeton_foundation__a_skeptic_s_take_52371.htm|title=The Templeton Foundation: A Skeptic's Take|publisher=John Horgan|date=7 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another 2010 article, Mooney took issue with Horgan's point, calling the idea that the fellowship was a "Trojan horse" for religion "pretty untenable". Templeton critics Richard Dawkins, [[A. C. Grayling]], and [[Daniel Dennett]] declined to answer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mooney|first=Chris|title=Science and Religion on the Cam, Part II|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/06/10/science-and-religion-on-the-cam-part-ii/#.VJiK_sAKA|website=Doscover|date=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Templeton-Cambridge fellow's interview requests, saying that they did not want to lend credibility to the science and religion journalism program. Mooney rejected this approach, writing, "You can't both denounce the fellowship for being intellectually tilted and also boycott it, thereby refusing to help lend it more of the balance you claim it needs". Grayling and Dennett answered this criticism as follows:

{{quote|... I disapprove of the Templeton Foundation's attempt to tie theologians to the coat tails of scientists and philosophers who actually do have expertise on this topic [that materialism is in Dennett's opinion not an obstacle to an ethical life].

Many years ago I made the mistake of participating, with some very good scientists, in a conference that pitted us against astrologers and other new age fakes. I learned to my dismay that even though we thoroughly dismantled the opposition, many in the audience ended up, paradoxically, with an increased esteem for astrologers! As one person explained to me "I figured that if you scientists were willing to work this hard to refute it, there must be something to it!" Isn't it obvious to you that the Templeton Foundation is eager to create the very same response in its readers?

{{quote|I cannot agree with the Templeton Foundation's project of trying to make religion respectable by conflating it with science; this is like mixing astrology with astronomy or voodoo with medical research, and I disapprove of Templeton's use of its great wealth to bribe compliance with this project. Templeton is to all intents and purposes a propaganda organisation for religious outlooks; it should honestly say so and equally honestly devote its money to prop up the antique superstitions it favours, and not pretend that questions of religion are of the same kind and on the same level as those of science—by which means it persistently seeks to muddy the waters and keep religion credible in lay eyes. It is for this reason I don't take part in Templeton-associated matters.|[[A.C. Grayling]]&lt;ref name="whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com"/&gt;}}

====Donald Wiebe====
Donald Wiebe, scholar of [[religious studies]] at the [[University of Toronto]], criticized the Templeton Foundation in a 2009 article entitled ''Religious Biases in Funding Religious Studies Research?''. According to him, the Templeton Foundation supports Christian bias in the field of religious studies, by deliberately imposing constraints to steer the results of the research.&lt;ref name=Wiebe/&gt;

{{quote|... A cursory review of these projects suggested to me that the religious (perhaps, speaking liberally, Christian) objectives of the Templeton Foundation were sufficiently problematic to warrant critical public scrutiny of their support for Religious Studies research. It seems to me that obtaining a grant from the Foundation involves constraints that impose a religious bias on the research they fund. As I see it, the Foundation seeks, whether directly or indirectly, to transform genuinely scientific research agendas into religious ones ...&lt;ref name=Wiebe/&gt;}}

====Jerry Coyne====
In 2011, the science journal ''Nature'' took note of the ongoing controversy among scientists over working with Templeton.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt; [[Jerry Coyne]], [[University of Chicago]] evolutionary biologist  sees a fundamental impossibility in attempting to reconcile faith with science.

{{quote|"Religion is based on dogma and belief, whereas science is based on doubt and questioning," says Coyne, echoing an argument made by many others. "In religion, faith is a virtue. In science, faith is a vice". The purpose of the Templeton Foundation is to break down that wall, he says—to reconcile the irreconcilable and give religion scholarly legitimacy ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/nature-on-templeton/|title=''Nature'' on Templeton|website=Why Evolution Is True|date=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A fierce Templeton critic, Coyne told ''Nature'' writer Mitchell Waldrop that the Foundation's purpose is to eliminate the wall between religion and science, and to use science's prestige to validate religion. Other scientists, including Foundation grantees like University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo and Anthony Aguirre, a University of California—Santa Cruz astrophysicist, told ''Nature'' that they have never felt pressured by Templeton to spin their research toward religion-friendly conclusions.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

====John Horgan====
[[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]], a science journalist and the author of several books, in 2006 wrote an article for ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' (reprinted in ''Edge'') of his "misgivings about the foundation's agenda of reconciling religion and science". He said that a conference he attended favored scientists who "offered a perspective clearly skewed in favor of religion and Christianity", and says that:

{{quote|One Templeton official made what I felt were inappropriate remarks about the foundation's expectations of us fellows. She told us that the meeting cost more than $1-million, and in return the foundation wanted us to publish articles touching on science and religion.&lt;ref name="Edge Horgan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/horgan06/horgan06_index.html|title=The Templeton Foundation: A Skeptic's Take|last=Horgan|first=John|date=4 May 2006|website=Edge}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Horgan fears recipients of large grants from the Templeton Foundation sometimes write what the Foundation wants rather than what they believe.

{{quote|Several areligious scientists told me privately that they did not want to challenge the beliefs of religious speakers for fear of offending them and the Templeton hosts.&lt;ref name="Edge Horgan"/&gt;}}

====Nathan Schneider====
In 2010, journalist [[Nathan Schneider]] published a lengthy investigative article about the Templeton Foundation, entitled ''God, Science and Philanthropy'', in ''[[The Nation]]''. In the article, he aired familiar complaints about the Foundation, but observed that many of its critics and grantees alike failed to appreciate "the breadth of the foundation's activities, much less the quixotic vision of its founder, John Templeton". Schneider observed: "At worst, Templeton could be called heterodox and naïve; at best, his was a mind more open than most, reflective of the most inventive and combinatorial strains of American religious thought, eager to radically reinterpret ancient wisdom and bring it up to speed with some version from the present."&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/god-science-and-philanthropy?page=full|title=God, Science and Philanthropy|newspaper=The Nation|date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the foundation, in Schneider's view, "has associated itself with political and religious forces that cause it to be perceived as threatening the integrity of science and protecting the religious status quo," these alliances meant the foundation "is also better positioned than most to foster a conservatism—and a culture generally—that holds the old habits of religions and business responsible to good evidence, while helping scientists better speak to people's deepest concerns".&lt;ref name=schneider/&gt;

====Paul Davies====
Professor [[Paul Davies]], physicist and member of the Foundation's Board of Trustees, gave a defense of the Foundation's role in the scientific community in the Times Higher Education Supplement in March 2005. Responding to concerns about the funding of such research by religious organisations that might have a hidden agenda and in particular the Templeton Foundation, Davies said:

{{quote|If the foundation were indeed a religious organisation with its own specific doctrine, [the] objections would have substance. In fact, it is nothing of the sort. The benefactor, Sir John Templeton, bemoans the way that religious leaders often claim to have all the answers. Imagine, he says, consulting a doctor about an ailment, only to find him reaching for a volume of Hippocrates.  Yet priests rely on ancient scriptures to deliver spiritual guidance. Sir John wants to address the big questions of existence with humility and open-mindedness, adopting the model of scientific research in place of religious dogma. "How little we know!" is his favourite aphorism. It is a radical message, as far from religious fundamentalism as it is possible to get.

... recurring research themes supported by the foundation are the search for extra-solar planets, the properties of liquid water, the evolution of primate behaviour, emergent properties of complex systems, the foundations of quantum mechanics and the biological and social bases for forgiveness in areas of human conflict. In none of these projects is anything like a preferred religious position encouraged or an obligation imposed to support any religious group.

Britain is a post-religious society. Yet ordinary men and women still yearn for some sort of deeper meaning to their lives.  Can science point the way? Science has traditionally been regarded as dehumanising and alienating, trivialising the significance of humans and celebrating the pointlessness of existence. But many scientists, atheists included, see it differently. They experience what Einstein called "a cosmic religious feeling" when reflecting on the majesty of the cosmos and the extraordinary elegance and ingenuity of its mathematical laws.

Science cannot and should not be a substitute for religion. But I see nothing sinister or unprofessional about scientists working with open-minded theologians to explore how science might be a source of inspiration rather than demoralisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seeking inspiration in science|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/seeking-inspiration-in-science/194642.article|date=11 March 2005|website=Times Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Peter Woit====
[[Peter Woit]], a mathematical physicist at [[Columbia University]], occasionally writes about his misgivings with the foundation on his blog (which is hosted by Columbia University). Woit feels it is unfortunate that Templeton's money is used to influence scientific research towards a convergence between science and religion.

In June 2005, Woit wrote:

{{quote|Look not at what the Templeton people say (which is relatively innocuous), but at what they do. They explicitly refuse to support serious science, and instead fund an incredible array of attempts to inject religion into scientific practice. ... Instead they are heavily funding the one part of the field that most people consider dangerous pseudo-science and a serious threat to the whole concept of what it means to do science.&lt;ref name=Woit1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=205|title=Multiverse, String Theory and Templeton|last=Woit|first=Peter|date=12 June 2005|work=Not Even Wrong (Peter Woit's blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In October 2007, he gave this more qualified, but still largely critical, assessment of the Foundation following attendance at a Templeton sponsored seminar:
 
{{quote|The symposium I attended had not a trace of involvement of religion in it, and it seems that Templeton is careful to keep this out of some of the things that it funds as pure science ... They appear to have a serious commitment to the idea of funding things in physics that can be considered "foundational". People working in some such areas often are considered out of the physics mainstream and so find it hard to get their research funded. For them, Templeton is in many ways a uniquely promising funding source.

... However, they unambiguously are devoted to trying to bring science and religion together, and that's my main problem with them. ... I remain concerned though about the significance for physics of this large new source of funding, out of scale with other such private sources, and with an agenda that seems to me to have a dangerous component to it.&lt;ref name=Woit2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=606|title=Deep Beauty|last=Woit|first=Peter|date=6 October 2007|work=Not Even Wrong (Peter Woit's blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nonetheless, Woit's impression is that the Foundation is careful to keep conservative politics out of its activities and he does state that "their encouragement of religion seems to be of a very ecumenical nature".&lt;ref name=Woit2/&gt;

On 16 March 2012, in an article entitled ''Templeton Millions'', Woit expressed a more scathing critique of the Templeton Foundation:

{{quote|... I think what is going on here is very dangerous. The Templeton Foundation's agenda is not the advancement of science, it is the advancement of a particular religious point of view about what science is and how it should be done. They are very cleverly putting large sums of money into backing theology and pseudo-scientific research at the most prestigious academic institutions in the world. One reason that these places are happily taking the money is because public funding is drying up. The organization is extremely wealthy, and now led by Templeton's son, who when he isn't spending his father's money on this is spending it on promoting Rick Santorum's political career or other far-right causes.&lt;ref name=Woit3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=4478&amp;cpage=1|title=Templeton Millions|last=Woit|first=Peter|date=16 March 2012|work=Not Even Wrong (Peter Woit's blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Woit wrote that the Templeton Foundation that year funded a project led by the astronomer Donald York of the [[University of Chicago]] because he is an [[evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]], quoting a statement of the Foundation itself.&lt;ref name=Woit3/&gt;

====PZ Myers====
On 7 May 2009, [[PZ Myers]], biologist at the [[University of Minnesota Morris]], wrote:

{{quote|They have an agenda, and it is one of the most corrupting and untrustworthy causes of all, religion. They already know the answer, and they only want to pay for results that can be interpreted to bolster their unsupportable claims. Even if they are not asking that anyone fake evidence, we know that any line of inquiry that leads away from their desired answer will be abandoned, even if it is leading to the right answer. They are antithetical to good science. ... And, boy are they loaded, with a massive endowment and the willingness to throw large sums of money around. Scarily huge sums — the kind of money that will tempt even the most principled scientist to compromise a little bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PZ Myers|url=https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/07/the-templeton-conundrum/#more://|title=The Templeton condrum|website=Freethought Blogs – Pharyngula|date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Richard Dawkins====
In his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] (an [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]]) repeatedly criticizes the Templeton Foundation, referring to the Templeton Prize as "a very large sum of money given ... usually to a scientist who is prepared to say something nice about religion". Concerning the conference that he and John Horgan attended, and to John Horgan's resulting article, Dawkins comments, "If I understand Horgan's point, it is that Templeton's money corrupts science".&lt;ref name='GodDelusion'&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The God Delusion|publisher=Black Swan|year=2006|location=UK|isbn=9780552773317|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Templeton funded a study specifically targeting Richard Dawkins, authored by a team led by the Templeton-funded sociologist [[Elaine Howard Ecklund]], of the [[Rice University]]. Out of a total number of interviewed scientists, the authors selected those who didn't like Dawkins, and compiled an entire publication based on their opinion. In the article Dawkins is variously called "Mr. Anti-God Europe", "extremely arrogant" and "overly aggressive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2016/11/18/in-defense-of-richard-dawkins-elaine-ecklund-and-team-write-a-pointless-templeton-funded-paper-saying-that-surveyed-scientists-feel-that-dawkins-misrepresents-science/|title=In defense of Richard Dawkins: Elaine Ecklund and team write a pointless, Templeton-funded paper saying that Dawkins "misrepresents science"|website=Why Evolution is True|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sean M. Carroll====
[[Sean M. Carroll]], a [[cosmologist]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]], wrote, in describing his self-recusal from a conference he discovered was funded by the Foundation, that "the entire purpose of the Templeton Foundation is to blur the line between straightforward science and explicitly religious activity, making it seem like the two enterprises are part of one big undertaking. It's all about appearances". But he also said, "I appreciate that the Templeton Foundation is actually, in its own way, quite pro-science, and is not nearly as objectionable as the anti-scientific crackpots at the [[Discovery Institute]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Sean|url=http://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2005_04_01_preposterousuniverse_archive.html#111387591806156772|title=Purity of essence|date=18 April 2005|website=Preposterous Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sunny Bains====
Sunny Bains of [[University College London]] Faculty of Engineering Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Sunny Bains Biography|url=http://www.sunnybains.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that there is:

{{quote|... evidence of cronyism (especially in the awarding in those million-dollar-plus Templeton prizes), a misleading attempt to move away from using religious language (without changing the religious agenda), the funding of right-wing anti-science groups, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bains|first=Sunny|title=Keeping an eye on the John Templeton Foundation|date=6 April 2011|url=https://www.absw.org.uk/news-and-events/news/keeping-an-eye-on-the-john-templeton-foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bains feels the Templeton Foundation "blur the line between science and religion". Bains' claims have been disputed by Josh Rosenau of the National Center for Science Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenau|first=Josh|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2011/03/how_bad_is_the_templeton_found.php|title=How bad is the Templeton Foundation? – Thoughts from Kansas|publisher=Scienceblogs.com|date=5 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502174515/http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2011/03/how_bad_is_the_templeton_found.php|archivedate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Priestley.jpg|thumb|200px|Priestley by [[Ellen Sharples]] (1794)&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, ''Iconography'', 28&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Joseph Priestley]] (13 March 1733 ([[Julian calendar|old style]]) &amp;ndash; 8 February 1804) was a [[Kingdom of Britain|British]] [[natural philosopher]], [[Political philosophy|political theorist]], clergyman, [[theologian]], and educator. He was one of the most influential [[English dissenters|Dissenters]] of the late 18th-century.

A member of marginalized religious groups throughout his life and a proponent of what was called "rational Dissent", Priestley advocated [[religious toleration]] (challenging even [[William Blackstone]]), helped [[Theophilus Lindsey]] found the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church and promoted the repeal of the [[Test Act|Test]] and [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation Acts]] in the 1780s. As the foremost British expounder of [[providentialism]], he argued for extensive civil rights, believing that individuals could bring about progress and eventually the [[Millennialism|Millennium]].&lt;ref name="Tapper, 314"&gt;Tapper, 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley's religious beliefs were integral to his metaphysics as well as his politics and he was the first philosopher to "attempt to combine theism, materialism, and determinism," a project that has been called "audacious and original."&lt;ref name="Tapper, 314"/&gt;

==Defender of Dissenters and political philosopher==
Priestley claimed throughout his life that politics did not interest him and that he did not participate in it. What appeared to others as political arguments were for Priestley always, at their root, religious arguments. Many of what we would call Priestley's political writings were aimed at supporting the repeal of the [[Test Act|Test]] and [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation Acts]], a political issue that had its foundation in religion.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, need page number.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1660 and 1665, Parliament passed a series of laws that restricted the rights of dissenters: they could not hold political office, teach school, serve in the military or attend [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] unless they ascribed to the [[thirty-nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]]. In 1689, a [[Act of Toleration 1689|Toleration Act]] was passed that restored some of these rights, if dissenters subscribed to 36 of the 39 articles ([[Catholics]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] were excluded), but not all Dissenters were willing to accept this compromise and many refused to [[nonconformism|conform]]. Throughout the 18th century Dissenters were persecuted and the laws against them were erratically enforced. Dissenters continually petitioned Parliament to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, claiming that the laws made them second-class citizens. The situation worsened in 1753 after the passage of [[Marriage Act 1753|Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act]] which stipulated that all marriages must be performed by Anglican ministers; some refused to perform Dissenting weddings at all.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 202&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley's friends urged him to publish a work on the injustices borne by Dissenters, a topic to which he had already alluded in his ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]'' (1765).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''An essay on a course of liberal education for civil and active life''. London: Printed for C. Henderson under the Royal Exchange; T. Becket and De Hondt in the Strand; and by J. Johnson and Davenport, in Pater-Noster-Row, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was Priestley's ''[[Essay on the First Principles of Government]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''An essay on the first principles of government; and on the nature of political, civil, and religious liberty''. Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; which Priestley's major modern biographer calls his "most systematic political work," in 1768.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The book went through three English editions and was translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. [[Jeremy Bentham]] credited it with inspiring his "greatest happiness principle."&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis of Bentham's statements on this issue, see Schofield, Vol. 1, 207&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Essay on Government'' is not strictly [[utilitarian]], however; like all of Priestley's works, it is infused with the belief that society is progressing towards perfection. Although much of the text rearticulates [[John Locke|John Locke's]] arguments from his ''[[Two Treatises on Government]]'' (1689), it also makes a useful distinction between political and civil rights and argues for protection of extensive civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, 17; Tapper, 315.&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguishes between a private and a public sphere of governmental control; education and religion, in particular, he maintains, are matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. As Kramnick states, "Priestley's fundamental maxim of politics was the need to limit state interference on individual liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Kramnick, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; For early [[liberalism|liberals]] like Priestley and Jefferson, the "defining feature of liberal politics" was its emphasis on the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 209&amp;ndash;10; Jackson, 100&amp;ndash;1; Uglow, 169; Kramnick, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement that articulates key elements of early liberalism and anticipates utilitarian arguments, Priestley wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It must necessarily be understood, therefore, that all people live in society for their mutual advantage; so that the good and happiness of the members, that is the majority of the members of any state, is the great standard by which every thing relating to that state must finally be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Gibbs, 40 and Uglow, 169; Tapper, 315.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Priestley acknowledged that revolution was necessary at times but believed that Britain had already had its only necessary revolution in [[Glorious Revolution|1688]], although his later writings would suggest otherwise. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Tapper, 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley would repeatedly return to these themes throughout his career, particularly when defending the rights of Dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 39&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critic of William Blackstone's ''Commentaries''===
In another attempt to champion the rights of Dissenters, Priestley defended their constitutional rights against the attacks of [[William Blackstone]], an eminent legal theorist. Blackstone's ''Commentaries'', fast becoming the standard reference for legal interpretation, stated that dissent from the Church of England was a crime and argued that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects. Furious, Priestley lashed out with his ''Remarks on Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries'' (1769), correcting Blackstone's grammar, his history and his interpretation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''Remarks on some paragraphs in the fourth volume of Dr. Blackstone’s Commentaries on the laws of England, relating to the Dissenters''. London: Printed for J. Johnson and J. Payne, 1769.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackstone, chastened, replied in a pamphlet and altered his ''Commentaries'' in subsequent editions; he rephrased the offending passages but still described Dissent as a crime.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 214&amp;ndash;16; Gibbs, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founder of Unitarianism===
{{See also|History of Unitarianism}}
When Parliament rejected the [[Feather's Tavern petition]] in 1772, which would have released Dissenters from subscribing to the [[thirty-nine articles]], many Dissenting ministers, as [[William Paley]] wrote, "could not afford to keep a conscience."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield, Vol. 2, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley's friend from Leeds, [[Theophilus Lindsey]], decided to try. He gave up his church, sold his books so that he would have money to live on and established the first Unitarian chapel in [[London]]. The radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]] helped him find a building, which became known as [[Essex Street Chapel]].&lt;ref name="unitarian.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.unitarian.org.uk/support/doc-EssexHall2.shtml chapter 2 ''The History of Essex Hall'' by Mortimer Rowe B.A., D.D. Lindsey Press, 1959.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307014023/http://www.unitarian.org.uk/support/doc-EssexHall2.shtml |date=7 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley's patron at the time, [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]], promised that he would keep the church out of legal difficulties (barrister [[John Lee (Attorney-General)|John Lee]], later Attorney-General, also helped&lt;ref name="unitarian.org.uk"/&gt;), and Priestley and many others hurried to raise money for Lindsey.

On 17 April 1774, the chapel had its first service. Lindsey had designed his own liturgy, of which many were critical. Priestley rushed to his defense with ''Letter to a Layman, on the Subject of the Rev. Mr. Lindsey's Proposal for a Reformed English Church'' (1774),&lt;ref&gt;Need publication information.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that only the form of worship had been altered and attacking those who only followed religion as a fashion. Priestley attended the church regularly while living in [[Calne]] with Shelburne and even occasionally preached there.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 26&amp;ndash;8; Jackson, 124; Gibbs, 88&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to support institutionalized Unitarianism after he moved to [[Birmingham]] in 1780, writing several ''Defenses'' of Unitarianism and encouraging the foundation of new Unitarian chapels throughout Britain and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 225; 236&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt; He also compiled and edited a liturgy and hymnbook for the new denomination.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 200&amp;ndash;1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787, 1789 and 1790, Dissenters again tried to repeal the [[Test Act|Test]] and [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation Acts]]. Although initially it looked as if they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of the [[French revolution]] looming in the minds of many members of Parliament, few were swayed by [[Charles James Fox|Charles James Fox's]] arguments for equal rights. Political cartoons, one of the most effective and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley specifically.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 176&amp;ndash;83.&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of these trying times, it was the betrayal of [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] and [[Edmund Burke]] that most angered Priestley and his friends; they had expected the two men's support and instead both argued vociferously against the repeal. Priestley wrote a series of ''Letters to William Pitt''&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A letter to the Right Honourable William Pitt, ... on the subjects of toleration and church establishments; occasioned by his speech against the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, on Wednesday the 28th of March, 1787''. Need publication information for first edition and other letters.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Letters to Burke''&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''Letters to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke, occasioned by his Reflections on the Revolution in France, &amp;c.'' Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but to no avail. These publications unfortunately also inflamed the populace against him.

In its propaganda against the "radicals," Pitt's administration argued that Priestley and other Dissenters wanted to overthrow the government. Dissenters who had supported the French revolution came under increasing suspicion as skepticism over the revolution's benefits and ideals grew.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 269&amp;ndash;81; Thorpe, 122&amp;ndash;125; Uglow, 409; 435&amp;ndash;38.&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1790 [[Richard Price]], the other leading Dissenting minister in Britain at the time, gave a rousing sermon supporting the French revolutionaries and comparing them to [[Glorious Revolution|English revolutionaries of 1688]], Burke responded with his famous ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Need publication information for first edition of Burke's text.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley rushed to the defense of his friend and of the revolutionaries, publishing one of the many responses, along with [[Thomas Paine]] and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], that became part of the "[[Revolution Controversy]]." Paradoxically, it is Burke, the secular statesman, who argued against science and maintained that religion should be the basis of civil society while Priestley, the Dissenting minister, argued that religion could not provide the basis for society and should be restricted to one's private life.&lt;ref&gt;Kramnick, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political adviser to Lord Shelburne==
Priestley also served as a kind of political adviser to Lord Shelburne while he working for him as a tutor and librarian; he gathered information for him on parliamentary issues and served as a conduit of information for Dissenting and American interests.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 91&amp;ndash;94.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley published several political works during these years, most of which were focused on the rights of dissenters, such as ''An Address to Protestant Dissenters . . . on the Approaching Election of Members of Parliament'' (1774).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''An address to Protestant dissenters of all denominations, on the approaching election of Members of Parliament, with respect to the state of public liberty in general, and of American affairs in particular''. London: Printed for Joseph Johnson, 1774.&lt;/ref&gt; This pamphlet was published anonymously and Schofield calls it "the most outspoken of anything he ever wrote."&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley called on Dissenters to vote against those in Parliament who had, by refusing to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, denied them their rights. He wrote a second part dedicated to defending the rebelling American colonists at the behest of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[John Fothergill (physician)|John Fothergill]]. The pamphlets created a stir throughout Britain but the results of the election did not favor Shelburne's party.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 13&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materialist philosopher and theologian==
In a series of five major metaphysical works, all written between 1774 and 1778, Priestley laid out his [[materialist]] view of the world and tried "to defend Christianity by making its metaphysical framework more intelligible," even though such a position "entailed denial of free will and the soul."&lt;ref name="Tapper, 316"&gt;Tapper, 316.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major work to address these issues was ''The Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry ... Dr. Beattie's Essay ... and Dr. Oswald's Appeal'' (1774).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''An examination of Dr. Reid’s Inquiry into the human mind on the principles of common sense, Dr. Beattie’s Essay on the nature and immutability of truth, and Dr. Oswald’s Appeal to common sense in behalf of religion''. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1774.&lt;/ref&gt; He challenged [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Scottish common-sense philosophy]], which claimed that "common sense" trumped reason in matters of religion. Relying on Locke and [[David Hartley (philosopher)|Hartley's]] [[associationism]], he argued strenuously against Reid's [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]] and maintained that ideas did not have to resemble their referents in the world; ideas for Priestley were not pictures in the mind but rather causal associations.&lt;ref name="Tapper, 316"/&gt; From these arguments, Priestley concluded that "ideas and objects must be of the same substance,"&lt;ref name="Tapper, 316"/&gt; a radically materialist view at the time. The book was popular and readers of all persuasions read it. [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]] wrote to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], recommending "that clear, strong, humorous, most entertaining piece of reasoning"&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield, Vol. 2, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; and Priestley heard rumors that even [[David Hume|Hume]] had read the work and "declared that the manner of the work was proper, as the argument was unanswerable."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield, Vol. 2, 51; 44&amp;ndash;51.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PriestleyMatterSpirit.png|right|thumb|upright|Title page from the first edition of ''[[Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit]]'' (1777)]]
When arguing for materialism in his ''Examination'' Priestley strongly suggested that there was no [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body duality]]. Such opinions shocked and angered many of his readers and reviewers who believed that for the [[soul]] to exist, there had to be a mind-body duality. In order to clarify his position he wrote ''[[Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit]]'' (1777),&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit. To which is added, the history of the philosophical doctrine concerning the origin of the soul, and the nature of matter; with its influence on Christianity, especially with respect to the doctrine of the pre-existence of Christ''. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1777.&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed that both "matter" and "force" are active, and therefore that objects in the world and the mind must be made of the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;Tapper, 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley also argued that discussing the soul was impossible because it is made of a divine substance and humanity cannot gain access to the divine. He therefore denied the materialism of the soul while simultaneously claiming its existence. Although he buttressed his arguments with familiar scholarship and ancient authorities, including scripture, he was labeled an [[atheist]]. At least a dozen hostile refutations of the work were published by 1782.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 59&amp;ndash;76; Gibbs, 99&amp;ndash;100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley continued this series of arguments in ''[[The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated]]'' (1777);&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''The doctrine of philosophical necessity illustrated; being an appendix to the Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit. To which is added an answer to the Letters on materialism, and on Hartley’s Theory of the mind''. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1777.&lt;/ref&gt; the text was designed as an "appendix" to the ''Disquisitions'' and "suggests that materialism and determinism are mutually supporting."&lt;ref&gt;Tapper, 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley explicitly stated that humans had no [[free will]]: "all things, past, present, and to come, are precisely what the Author of nature really intended them to be, and has made provision for."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield, Vol. 2, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; His notion of "philosophical necessity," which he was the first to claim was consonant with Christianity, at times resembles [[determinism|absolute determinism]]; it is based on his understanding of the natural world and theology: like the rest of nature, man's mind is subject to the laws of causation, but because a benevolent God has created these laws, Priestley argued, the world as a whole will eventually be perfected.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, 55; Tapper, 319; Sheps, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the associations made in a person's mind were a ''necessary'' product of their lived experience because Hartley's theory of associationism was analogous to natural laws such as [[gravity]]. Priestley  contends that his necessarianism can be distinguished from [[fatalism]] and [[predestination]] because it relies on natural law. Isaac Kramnick points out the paradox of Priestley's positions: as a reformer, he argued that political change was essential to human happiness and urged his readers to participate, but he also claimed in works such as ''Philosophical Necessity'' that humans have no free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kramnick, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Philosophical Necessity'' influenced the 19th-century [[utilitarian]]s [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], who were drawn to its determinism. [[Immanuel Kant]], entranced by Priestley's determinism but repelled by his reliance on observed reality, created a transcendental version of determinism that he claimed allowed liberty to the mind and soul.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 77&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last of his important books on metaphysics, ''[[Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever]]'' (1780),&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''Letters to a philosophical unbeliever. Containing an examination of the principal objections to the doctrines of natural religion, and especially those contained in the writings of Mr. Hume''. Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley continues to defend his thesis that materialism and determinism can be reconciled with a belief in a God.&lt;ref&gt;Tapper, 320.&lt;/ref&gt; The seed for this book had been sown during his trip to Paris with Shelburne. Priestley recalled in his ''Memoirs'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As I chose on all occasions to appear as a Christian, I was told by some of them [''[[philosophes]]''], that I was the only person they had ever met with, of whose understanding they had any opinion, who professed to believe Christianity. But on interrogating them on the subject, I soon found that they had given no proper attention to it, and did not really know what Christianity was ... Having conversed so much with unbelievers at home and abroad, I thought I should be able to combat their prejudices with some advantage, and with this view I wrote ... the first part of my ‘Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever’, in proof of the doctrines of a God and a providence, and ... a second part, in defence of the evidences [sic] of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, ''Autobiography'', 111.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The text addresses those whose faith is shaped by books and fashion; Priestley draws an analogy between the skepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses. He again argues for the existence of God using what Schofield calls "the classic argument from design ... leading from the necessary existence of a creator-designer to his self-comprehension, eternal existence, infinite power, omnipresence, and boundless benevolence."&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In the three volumes, Priestley discusses, among many other works, [[Baron d'Holbach|Baron d'Holbach's]] ''[[The System of Nature|Systeme de la Nature]]'', often called the "bible of [[atheism]]." He claimed that d'Holbach's "energy of nature," though it lacked intelligence or purpose, was really a description of God. Priestley believed that [[David Hume|David Hume's]] style in the ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) was just as dangerous as its ideas; he feared the open-endedness of the Humean dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 37&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous journalists have been murdered or killed in the United States while reporting, covering a military conflict, or because of their status as a journalist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5164">'''Maud Edith Cunnington'''  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}}  (''[[née]]'' Pegge; 24 September 1869 – 28 February 1951) was a [[Wales|Welsh]]-born [[archaeologist]], most famous for her pioneering work on the prehistoric sites of [[Salisbury Plain]].

==Early life and education==
Maud Pegge was born at [[Briton Ferry]] in [[Glamorgan]] to  Catherine Milton Leach and her husband Charles Pegge, a doctor who ran Vernon House, the last privately owned [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] in Wales. She was one of seven children. Cunnington's older brother [[Edward Pegge|Edward]] followed his father as a doctor, and was also a notable rugby player and Welsh international. Maud was educated briefly at [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite book |first=Penelope |last=Rundle |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/45470 |title=Cunnington, Maud Edith (1869–1951) |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1897, Maud carried out early [[rescue archaeology]] work during development in the area but also carried out full [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] at some of the most important sites in British archaeology. These included the first known Neolithic [[causewayed enclosure]] at [[Knap Hil]], the [[Iron age]] village at [[All Cannings Cross]], [[West Kennet Long Barrow]], [[Figsbury Ring]], [[Woodhenge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mike |last=Parker Pearson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4j23BQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=Maud%20Cunnington&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q=Maud%20Cunnington&amp;f=false |title=Stonehenge: A New Understanding: Solving the Mysteries of the Greatest Stone Age Monument |publisher=Workman Publishing |date=2014 |pages=83–85 |isbn=9781615191932}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Sanctuary]]. This last monument she rediscovered as it had been lost since [[William Stukeley]] saw it in the eighteenth century. Woodhenge and The Sanctuary were bought by the Cunningtons and given to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Timothy |last=Darvill |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gzEclkBq0u0C&amp;lpg=PT31&amp;dq=Maud%20Cunnington&amp;pg=PT333#v=onepage&amp;q=Maud%20Cunnington&amp;f=false |title=Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |isbn=9780191579042}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 she excavated and re-erected one of the two surviving stones in the Beckhampton Avenue and one of the stones in the West Kennet Avenue at Avebury. In 1933, she was elected president of the [[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society]], the first woman to hold that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sara |last=Champion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brj2o4EF_EMC&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Maud%20Cunnington&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q=Maud%20Cunnington&amp;f=false |chapter=Women in British Archaeology: Visible and Invisible" |editor-first1=Margarita |editor-last1=Diaz-Andreu |editor-first2=Marie Louise Stig |editor-last2=Sorensen, |title=Excavating Women: A History of Women in European Archaeology |publisher=Routledge |date=2005 |page=177 |isbn=9781134727766}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to technical reports, she published a short handbook, ''Avebury: A Guide'' (1931),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Maud E. |last=Cunnington |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Avebury.html?id=ho5nrgEACAAJ |title=Avebury: A Guide |date=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a children's guide to Devizes Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Susan |last=Greaney |title=Maud Cunnington at Stonehenge |publisher=English Heritage |magazine=English Heritage Members' Magazine |date=April 2018 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1889, Maud Pegge married [[Ben Cunnington (archaeologist)|Ben Cunnington]] who was the honorary curator of [[Devizes]] Museum. Their only son, Edward, was killed in the [[First World War]]. 
Cunnington was named a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[1948 Birthday Honours]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38311 |date= 10 June 1948 |page=3374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for services to archaeology, the first woman archaeologist to receive the honour. However, she had been bedridden since 1947, and suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]], so she never knew of the accolade. When she died at home a few years later she left almost all her property (£14,000) to Devizes Museum (now [[Wiltshire Heritage Museum]]), allowing a salaried [[curator]] to be appointed for the first time. Her husband had died a few months earlier.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

'''Ordensburg Krössinsee''' (also ''Crössinsee'') was the first of three ''[[NS-Ordensburgen]]'', educational centers constructed in [[Germany]] in the 1930s for [[cadres]] of the [[Nazi Party]].  It was built near what was then the city of Falkenburg in [[Pomerania]], today [[Złocieniec]] in [[Poland]].  

Today, this former Nazi training centre is used by the 2nd Battalion, 12th Tank Brigade of the [[Polish Land Forces]].

== History ==

The groundbreaking for ''Ordensburg Krössinsee'' was on 22 April 1934. It was designed by the Cologne architect [[Clemens Klotz]]. The vast construction of rustic stone buildings with granite foundations was built at a cost of 20 million Reichsmarks, and the facility was officially dedicated on 24 April 1936. On 16 May 1941, the ''Ordensburg'' was renamed '''"Die Falkenburg am Krössinsee"''' (The Castle Falkenburg at Lake Krössin) by the Reichs Minister of Labor, Dr. [[Robert Ley|Ley, Robert]]. On 29 June 1944, a small portion of the complex was destroyed by fire.

''Ordensburg Krössinsee'' was one of three ''NS-Ordensburgen'', the others being [[Ordensburg Sonthofen]] in [[Allgäu]] and [[Ordensburg Vogelsang]] in [[Eifel]].  A fourth was planned, but never built, at (the historic) [[Ordensburg Marienburg]] in [[West Prussia]], known today as [[Malbork Castle]] in [[Poland]].

==Student requirements==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17964, Ordensburg Krössinsee, Herzog von Windsor.jpg|thumb|[[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, the Duke of Windsor]] on a visit to the ''Ordensburg Krössinsee'' 1937 (together with [[Robert Ley]] on the left in a white coat)]]
The Commander of the [[Ordensburg]] was Otto Gohdes. Cadets, known as Ordens Junkers, were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|4|in|m}}, between 23 and 26 years old, racially pure and in good health without any physical limitations. At the outbreak of [[World War II]], a very high percentage of Junkers were killed in action.

==Daily routine==

Two courses of studies took place here from 1937–38 and 1938-39.  Classes began each morning at 7 and included studies in philosophy, politics and world history. Afternoons were devoted to military drills, battle tactics, sports and equestrian techniques. The school was recognized for its outstanding equestrian program. The nearby lake provided the means for students to develop rowing and sailing skills.

==Hitler Youth==

In 1937, the cadres began sharing the facility with members of the Hitlerjungen or [[Hitler Youth]]. These boys between 12–18 years old eventually became the sole occupants of all three Order Castles with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] in 1939 and the start of World War II.

==Time capsule==
During the construction of the ''Ordensburg Krössinsee'', a copper cylinder [[time capsule]] was buried in the foundation of one of the towers, presumably in April 1934 when construction of the Nazi facility commenced.  The capsule was opened by archaeologists in 2016, more than 80 years after it had been buried.  Although the archeologists had long known that the time capsule was buried in the building foundation, they were not able to access it until 2016, and had to wade through groundwater, cut through thick concrete and evade potential German mines in order to reach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Platt|first1=Gareth|title=Nazi time capsule from 1934 found buried in Third Reich training school |url=http://talkradio.co.uk/news/nazi-time-capsule-1934-found-buried-third-reich-training-school-1609164215|accessdate=19 September 2016|publisher=[[Talkradio]]|date=16 September 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6kduYXm70|archivedate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many time capsules, the contents of which are often damaged or destroyed by water, the contents of this capsule were perfectly preserved.  The contents included photographs (including images of [[Adolf Hitler]]), newspapers from 1934, coins, books (including two copies of [[Mein Kampf]]), and promotional and historical materials about what was then the town of Falkenburg.  The contents were transferred to the [[National Museum, Szczecin|National Museum in Szczecin]] for cataloguing, translation, preservation and display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eleftheriou-Smith|first1=Loulla-Mae|title=Nazi time capsule: Newspapers, photographs and copies of Mein Kampf found ‘perfectly preserved’ in Poland|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/nazi-time-capsule-poland-mein-kampf-adolf-hitler-discovery-photos-a7315771.html|accessdate=19 September 2016|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=18 September 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6kduXhDw5|archivedate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3488">'''Pancake sentences''' are a phenomenon in [[Scandinavia]]n [[linguistics]] where [[Agreement (linguistics)|sentence agreement]] does not follow conventional linguistic patterns. The phrase appears to have been [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Hans-Olav Enger]] in a 2004 academic paper, "Scandinavian pancake sentences as semantic agreement" but it was well-known also by classic grammar and was dubbed "constructio ad sensum" or "syllepsis"; see [[zeugma and syllepsis]]. Enger states that pancake sentences are "where the predicative adjective apparently disagrees with its subject". This phenomenon may be related or compared to English language linguistics, where [[American English]] speakers might say "the team &lt;u&gt;has&lt;/u&gt; arrived", [[syntax|syntactically]] agreeing the singular ''team'', versus [[British English]] speakers saying "the team &lt;u&gt;have&lt;/u&gt; arrived", agreeing [[semantics|semantically]] to the collective noun ''team''.

An example from Swedish is the sentence "''Pannkakor är nyttigt''":

:{| 
|-
| ''Pannkak-or'' || ''är'' || ''nyttig-t''
|-
| Pancake-{{small|C.PL}} || {{small|COP}} || healthy-{{small|NEUT.SG}} 
|-
|colspan=9|It’s healthy to have pancakes.
|}

While ''Pannkakor'' 'pancakes' is plural and of common gender, ''nyttigt'' 'healthy' is inflected to singular and neuter.

A similar phenomenon also occurs in [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]], where the copula (and adjectives) appear to disagree with the subject, as well as is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] with some nouns used without the article (''Água é bom. É proibido entrada. Está proibido brincadeiras. '') when feminine nouns of either number agree with a masculine adjective in its singular form.

Pegida was founded in October 2014 by [[Lutz Bachmann]], who runs a [[public relations]] agency in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name=guard1412&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kate|title=Estimated 15,000 people join ‘pinstriped Nazis’ on march in Dresden|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/15/dresden-police-pegida-germany-far-right|accessdate=4 January 2015|work=The Guardian|date=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachmann's impetus for starting Pegida was witnessing a rally by alleged supporters of the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) against the siege of [[Kobani]] by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] (ISIL) on 10 October 2014 in Dresden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/regional/dresden/demonstrationen/pegida-erfinder-im-interview-38780422.bild.html |title=PEGIDA-Erfinder: Wir hören erst auf, wenn die Asyl-Politik sich ändert! - Dresden |publisher=Bild.de |date=1 December 2014 |accessdate=17 February 2015|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he posted on YouTube on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6aFr9GVE2c |title=KURDEN DEMO DRESDEN |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=  |website=Youtube |publisher=Lutz Bachmann |accessdate= 5 January 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he founded a [[Facebook group]] called ''{{lang|de|Patriotische Europäer Gegen die Islamisierung des Abendlandes}}'' ("Patriotic Europeans against Islamisation of the Occident").&lt;ref name=spie12-21-14/&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel2015-01-12&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/origins-of-german-anti-muslim-group-pegida-a-1012522.html|title=Prying into Pegida: Where Did Germany's Islamophobes Come From?|last1=Popp|first1=Maximilian|last2=Wassermann|first2=Andreas|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=12 January 2015|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days earlier, on 7 October, a group of Muslims, assumed to be [[Salafi movement|Salafists]], had violently attacked alleged PKK supporters who were gathering after a demonstration against ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro-ISIS radicals with machetes, knives attack Kurds in Germany|url=http://rt.com/news/194060-germany-kurds-muslims-brawls/|date=8 October 2014|accessdate=16 January 2015|work=[[RT (TV network)|RT.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, [[Yazidis]] and Muslim [[Chechens]] had violently clashed in [[Celle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany: Holy War Erupts in Hamburg|url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4780/hamburg-holy-war|date=15 October 2014|accessdate=16 January 2015|work=[[Gatestone Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October, out of 5,000 protesters, "at least 400 right-wing extremists went on a rampage in downtown [[Cologne]] during a demonstration" by "[[Hogesa|Hooligans Against Salafists]]".&lt;ref name=spie12-21-14/&gt; Bachmann mentioned these events in a release for his first demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/pegida-bewegung-gegen-islamisierung-des-abendlandes-13306852.html |title=Pegida: Bewegung gegen Islamisierung des Abendlandes |publisher=Faz.net |date=25 January 2016 |accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First wave of demonstrations===
The first demonstration, or "evening stroll" (according to Pegida),&lt;ref name=guard1615 /&gt; took place on 20 October 2014, and only attracted a handful of people.&lt;ref name=spie12-21-14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smale7/&gt; During the following days, the movement began gaining wider public attention, and, subsequently, the weekly Monday demonstrations drew larger numbers of people. Among the 7,500 participants on 1 December 2014, the police identified 80 to 120 [[hooliganism|hooligans]]. The demonstration grew to 10,000 people on 8 December 2014.&lt;ref name=Smale7&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smale|first1=Alison|title=In German City Rich With History and Tragedy, Tide Rises Against Immigration|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/08/world/in-german-city-rich-with-history-and-tragedy-tide-rises-against-immigration.html|accessdate=16 December 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirshbaum16&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirschbaum|first1=Erik|title=Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West quickly gathering support in Germany|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/patriotic-europeans-against-the-islamisation-of-the-west-quickly-gathering-support-in-germany-20141216-128105.html|accessdate=16 December 2014|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the weekly demonstrations on Monday evenings, Pegida supporters carried banners with slogans such as "For the preservation of our culture," "Against religious fanaticism, against any kind of radicalism, together without violence," and "Against religious wars on German soil."&lt;ref name="DW 7 December 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stute|first1=Dennis|title=Anti-Islamist protests with right-wing ties expand in Germany|url=http://www.dw.de/anti-islamist-protests-with-right-wing-ties-expand-in-germany/a-18113657|accessdate=9 December 2014|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath of ''Charlie Hebdo'' and rising tensions===

While the demonstration on 29 December 2014 was cancelled by the organizers, the movement continued to draw large numbers of participants in early January 2015. After the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]] on 7 January 2015 in Paris, politicians (including ministers [[Thomas de Maiziere]] and [[Heiko Maas]]) warned Pegida against misusing the attack on ''Charlie Hebdo'' for its own political ends. On Saturday 10 January 2015 some 35,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdr.de/sachsen/demonstrationen-in-dresden-und-bautzen100.html |title=35.000 Dresdner demonstrieren für Toleranz |publisher=MDR.DE |date=13 January 2015 |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-Pegida protesters gathered to mourn the victims of Paris, observing a [[minute's silence]] in front of the [[Dresden Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]].

On 12 January 2015, Pegida organizers organized a rally of some 25,000 participants. Pegida's main organizer, Bachmann, declared the six central political objectives of Pegida, which include calls for selective immigration and the expulsion of religious extremists, the right and duty to integrate, and tighter internal security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Record turnout at Dresden PEGIDA rally sees more than 25,000 march|url=http://www.dw.de/record-turnout-at-dresden-pegida-rally-sees-more-than-25000-march/a-18186820|first=Kate|last=Brady|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=12 January 2015|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2015, a young [[Eritrea]]n immigrant, [[Murder of Khaled Idris Bahray|Khaled Idris Bahray]], was found stabbed to death in his Dresden high-rise apartment. International media correspondents portrayed an "atmosphere of hatred and resentment" and published social media comments of Pegida sympathizers, who had expressed disdain for the dead Eritrean.

Dresden police did not permit the demonstration planned for 19 January 2015, due to a definite threat against one of Pegida's leadership members in form of an Arabic-language [[Twitter|tweet]] labelling Pegida an "enemy of Islam".&lt;ref name=huff&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sommers|first1=Jack |title=Pegida Cancel Lastest &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; Dresden Demonstration After Threats|work=Huffington Post UK| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/01/18/pegida-cancel-dresden-demo_n_6496262.html|accessdate=19 January 2015|publisher=AOL (UK) Limited|date=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pegida cancelled its 13th demonstration and stated in a post on its Facebook page that there was an explicit threat against a leadership member, and "his execution had been ordered by ISIS terrorists".&lt;ref name=reu11815&gt;{{cite news|title=Dresdner Polizei verbietet Demos wegen Anschlagsgefahr| url=http://de.reuters.com/article/topNews/idDEKBN0KR0N620150118|accessdate=19 January 2015|work=Reuters|publisher=Thomson Reuters|date=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Pegida demonstrations resumed in full force in the summer and autumn of 2015, with 10,000 demonstrators attending a rally in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Germany faces massive anti-migrant vs. pro-migrant standoff amid refugee crisis|url = http://www.rt.com/news/314684-germany-protests-migrants-pegida/|accessdate = 1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignations===
On 21 January 2015, Bachmann resigned from his position with Pegida after coming under fire for a number of Facebook posts.&lt;ref name=ft20150121&gt;{{cite web|title=German populist leader quits after Hitler pose emerges|first=Stefan|last=Wagstyl|work=[[Financial Times]]|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4b28b384-a154-11e4-bd03-00144feab7de.html|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts from a closed Facebook conversation incriminated Bachmann as having designated immigrants as "animals", "scumbags"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dw.de/pegida-founder-bachmann-quits-after-hitler-mustache-photo/a-18207351 |title=PEGIDA founder Bachmann quits after Hitler mustache photo |publisher=DW |date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "trash",&lt;ref name=Guardian20150121 /&gt; classified as [[hate speech]] in Germany.

On another occasion, Bachmann had posted a photo of a man wearing the uniform of the US white supremacist organisation [[Ku Klux Klan]] accompanied by the slogan: "Three Ks a day keeps the minorities away".&lt;ref name=ft20150121 /&gt; The Dresden state prosecutors opened an investigation for suspected ''[[Volksverhetzung]]'' (incitement), and [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Deputy Chancellor]] [[Sigmar Gabriel]] said the real face of Pegida had been exposed: "Anyone who puts on a Hitler disguise is either an idiot or a Nazi. People should think carefully about running after a [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]] like this".&lt;ref name=Reuters20150121 /&gt;

''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that Pegida's media spokeswoman, [[Kathrin Oertel]], turned to the [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]] for advice, and that the ''[[Sächsische Zeitung]]'' and ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' both confirmed there was a phone conversation between the AfD's [[Frauke Petry]] and Oertel. Petry said to Oertel that Bachmann should no longer be supported ("Ich habe ihr gesagt, dass Bachmann nicht mehr zu halten ist"). On that same day Oertel announced Bachmann's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skandal um Lutz Bachmann: AfD beriet Pegida in Hitler-Affäre|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/afd-beriet-pegida-in-der-hitler-affaere-von-lutz-bachmann-a-1014623.html|accessdate=23 February 2016|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reinstatement===
In February 2015, Pegida confirmed on its Facebook page that Lutz Bachmann had been re-elected as chairman by the six other members of the organisation’s leadership committee, after the [[Sächsische Zeitung]] published a report that the Hitler moustache on the now infamous photo had been added after the photo was taken.&lt;ref name="rein"/&gt;

=== Party founding ===
The founder of Pegida, Lutz Bachmann, has set up a new political party, the ''Freiheitlich Direktdemokratische Volkspartei'' ("Liberal Direct Democratic People's Party", or "FDDV").  The FDDV was established on 13 June 2016.&lt;ref name="party"&gt;{{cite web | last=GmbH | first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung | title=Dresden: Pegida-Anhänger gründen offenbar eigene Partei | website=FAZ.NET | date=19 July 2016 | url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/lutz-bachmann-hat-angeblich-eine-pegida-partei-gegruendet-14348098.html | language=de | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]] founded a subsidiary branch of Pegida in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Allchorn, William.

Pegida's specific demands were initially unclear, largely because Pegida has refused a dialogue, considering the press to be a politically correct conspiracy.&lt;ref name=econ115 /&gt; Demonstrators have been observed chanting "[[Lügenpresse]]" (lying press) a term that has a long history in German politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=24 February 2016 |title=Lying Press?

According to Frank Richter, director of Saxony's [[Federal Agency for Civic Education]], Pegida is "a mixed group—known figures from the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]], soccer hooligans, but also a sizable number of ordinary citizens".&lt;ref name=Smale7/&gt; Werner Schiffauer, director of the Migration Council has pointed out that the movement is strongest where people have hardly any experience with foreigners, and among "easterners who never really arrived in the Federal Republic and who now feel they have no voice".&lt;ref name=econ115&gt;{{cite news|title=The uprising of the decent|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21638194-xenophobic-marches-continue-parts-germany-others-stand-up-uprising-decent|accessdate=16 January 2015|work=Economist|date=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, Gordian Meyer-Plath, president of the [[Landesamt für Verfassungsschutz Sachsen|Landesamt für Verfassungsschutz]], said that initial suspicion that Pegida might tie in with the riots staged by [[Hogesa]] earlier in [[Cologne]] were not substantiated, so the movement was not put under official surveillance. He said there were no indications that the organizers were embracing right-wingers. This assessment was contested by the weekly ''[[Die Zeit]]'' who researched the ideological proximity of Pegida organizer Siegfried Däbritz to the [[Europe Defence League|German Defence League]] or the European [[Identitarian movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neues aus der Tabuzone|work=[[Die Zeit]]|issue=52|url=http://www.zeit.de/2014/52/pegida-dresden-wutbuerger-nationalismus-afd/seite-2|date=17 December 2014|accessdate=22 January 2015|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Der Tagesspiegel|Tagesspiegel]] interview on 19 January Meyer-Plath reaffirmed that the participant spectrum was very diverse and that there was no evidence of radicalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sachsen im Fokus der Dschihadisten|first=Frank |last=Jansen|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/verfassungsschutz-praesident-im-interview-sachsen-im-fokus-der-dschihadisten/11250948.html|date=19 January 2015|accessdate=22 January 2015|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dresden University of Technology]] (TU) interviewed 400 Pegida demonstrators on 22 December 2014 and 12 January 2015. According to the poll, the main reasons of their participation were dissatisfaction with the political situation (54 percent), "Islam, Islamism and Islamisation” (23 percent), criticism of the media and the public (20 percent), and reservations regarding asylum seekers and migrants (15 percent). In all, 42 percent had reservations regarding Muslims or Islam, 20 percent were concerned about a 'high rate of crimes' committed by asylum seekers, or feared socio-economic disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huber|first1=Joachim |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/medien/pegida-und-die-luegenpresse-wort-im-mund-umdrehen/11140250.html|title=Pegida und die "Lügenpresse". "Wort im Mund umdrehen"|accessdate=19 January 2015|agency=[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/ Der Tagesspiegel]|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author, Vorländer, did not see Pegida as a movement of right-wing extremists, pensioners or the unemployed, but stated that the rallies served as a way to express feelings and resentments against a political and opinion-making elite which have not been publicly articulated before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Federl|first1=Fabian|last2=Meisner|first2=Matthias |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/hitler-verkleidung-fluechtlinge-als-viehzeug-die-hintergruende-zum-fall-lutz-bachmann/11252882.html|title=Hitler-Verkleidung, Flüchtlinge als "Viehzeug".

A group of social scientists led by Dieter Rucht from the Social Science Research Centre Berlin ([[Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung]], WZB) collected data both by flyer and online survey. Despite a participation rate of only 18 percent in the online survey, it largely had similar results to the survey in Dresden. According to data from the WZB, Pegida was a male-dominated group, participants were mostly employees with a relatively high level of education, they had no confidence in institutions and they sympathized with [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]]. In some cases the participants demonstrated far-right and right-wing extremist attitudes. The conclusion emphasized that Pegida supporters cannot be viewed as 'ordinary citizens', since they articulate group-focused enmity and racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.merkur-online.de/politik/pegida-demonstrationen-dresden-anfuehrer-lutz-bachmann-helfer-4539731.html|title=Pegida: Das sind die Köpfe der Bewegung|agency=[http://www.merkur-online.de/ Merkur Online]|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hauser|first1=Uli|title=ie Köpfe hinter Pegida.

In protest against a Pegida march, the floodlights of the Catholic [[Cologne Cathedral]] were switched off on the evening of 5 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cologne Cathedral to turn out the lights in protest at anti-Muslim march|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/02/us-germany-immigration-idUSKBN0KB0KU20150102|accessdate=3 January 2015|work=Reuters|date=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dresden's [[Volkswagen]] plant used the same method of protest.&lt;ref name=volkswagen&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany Pegida protests: 'Islamisation' rallies denounced|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30694406|accessdate=6 January 2015|work=BBC News|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German tabloid newspaper ''[[Bild]]'' launched a petition against Pegida, including former Chancellors [[Helmut Schmidt]] and [[Gerhard Schröder]], as well as actress [[Karoline Herfurth]] and former footballer [[Oliver Bierhoff]].&lt;ref name=volkswagen/&gt;

===Polls===
According to a [[Opinion poll|survey]] by the Emnid institute conducted in December 2014, 53% of East Germans and 48% of West Germans showed understanding for Pegida demonstrations. Differentiated by political parties, supporters consisted of 86% of all surveyed [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]] members, 54% of all [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] members, 46% of all [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] members and 19% of all questioned supporters of [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]] and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Die Grünen]] respectively.&lt;ref name=n24&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Islam-Bewegung "Pegida": Mehrheit der Ostdeutschen zeigt Verständnis.|url=http://www.n24.de/n24/Nachrichten/Politik/d/5860796/mehrheit-der-ostdeutschen-zeigt-verstaendnis.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=n24|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 43% of all Germans participating in the survey thought that Pegida protesters are mainly concerned about the "spread of Islam“. 33% believed that mainly [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] extremists attend their demonstrations.&lt;ref name=Presseportal&gt;{{cite news|title=Deutsche vermuten Neonazis und besorgte Bürger hinter PEGIDA.|url=http://www.presseportal.de/pm/13399/2903923/n24-emnid-umfrage-zu-pegida-und-asyl-deutsche-vermuten-neonazis-und-besorgte-buerger-hinter-pegida|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Presseportal|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On behalf of German online newspaper Zeit Online, [[YouGov]] conducted a survey from 12 to 15 December 2014. The survey showed that 30% of all 1107 surveyed felt sympathetic with regards to the demonstrations. Another 19% said they were understanding rather than the opposite. 26% approved at least partially of the demonstrations, while 10% showed little sympathy and a further 13% no understanding at all.&lt;ref name="Die Zeit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Islam-Proteste: Jeder Zweite sympathisiert mit Pegida.|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-12/islam-pegida-fluechtlinge-deutschland-umfrage|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Die Zeit|date=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey by TNS Infratest conducted in December 2014 on behalf of German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' showed that 65% of all surveyed German citizens felt that the government did not respond appropriately to their concerns about asylum [[Public policy|policy]] and immigration. 28% disagreed, while 34% observed an increasing Islamisation in Germany.&lt;ref name="DerSpiegelSurvey"&gt;{{cite news|title=Spiegel-Umfrage zur Flüchtlingspolitik: Deutsche fühlen sich von Regierung übergangen.|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/deutsche-kritisieren-fluechtlingspolitik-ein-drittel-stimmt-pegida-zu-a-1008274.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Der Spiegel|date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A representative survey by Emnid conducted from 17 to 18 December 2014 showed that 85% of all 1006 surveyed were not willing to participate in demonstrations for Pegida policy. Only 9%, more than half of all surveyed AfD followers, said they were in fact willing to demonstrate.&lt;ref name=Focus&gt;{{cite news|title=Protest gegen angebliche Islamisierung – So viele Deutsche würden bei Pegida mitmarschieren.|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/protest-gegen-angebliche-islamisierung-umfrage-so-viele-deutsche-wuerden-mit-pegida-demonstrieren_id_4360367.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Focus|date=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2014, the [[Forsa Institute]] conducted a survey which showed that 67% of all surveyed Germans considered the danger of Islamisation exaggerated. 29%, consisting of 71% of all surveyed AfD supporters, felt too strong an Islamic influence in Germany and deemed respective demonstrations justified. 13% said they would participate in protests near their residence. 10%, consisting of 57% of all surveyed AfD followers, would even vote for an [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] party.&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite news|last=Mathes|first=Werner|title=stern-Umfrage: 13 Prozent der Deutschen würden für Pegida marschieren.|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/fuer-pegida-auf-die-strasse-13-prozent-der-deutschen-wuerden-mitmarschieren-2163092.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Stern|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special report by the [[Bertelsmann Foundation]], complemented by a TNS Emnid survey from November 2014, showed that a majority of German citizens considered Islam dangerous. Consequently, there seemed to be a "strong sympathy“ for „Pegida paroles“. In absolute numbers, 57% of all surveyed thought of Islam as a danger. 40% felt like "foreigners in their own country“, while 24% stated that they would like to prevent further Muslim immigration. These opinions were not exclusive to any political camps or [[social class]]es.&lt;ref name="ZeitSurveyIslamDanger"&gt;{{cite news|last=Löbbert|first=Raoul|title=Religionsmonitor: 57 Prozent der Deutschen fühlen sich vom Islam bedroht.|url=http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2015-01/islam-pegida-islamfeindlichkeit-religionsmonitor|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Zeit Online|date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political opponents===
Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] has criticized Pegida, saying that the leaders of Pegida "have prejudice, coldness, even hatred in their hearts”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/30/angela-merkel-criticizes-pegida-far-right-group-germany|title=Angela Merkel issues New Year’s warning over rightwing Pegida group|date=30 December 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Minister of the Interior]] [[Thomas de Maizière]] said that among the participants of the mass rallies were many ordinary people who expressed their concerns about the challenges of today's society.&lt;ref name="vek/dpa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=vek|first1=dpa|title= Protest-Märsche: De Maizière zeigt Verständnis für Pegida-Demonstranten|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/pegida-proteste-thomas-de-maiziere-zeigt-verstaendnis-a-1008028.html|accessdate=16 December 2014|publisher=SPIEGEL Online|date=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernd Lucke]], the leader of the political party [[Alliance for Progress and Renewal]], has said he considers most of the positions of Pegida to be legitimate.&lt;ref name=Hill16&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Jenny|title=Anti-Islam 'Pegida' march in German city of Dresden|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30478321|accessdate=16 December 2014|publisher=BBC|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lucke, the people taking part in these demonstrations did not feel that their concerns were being understood by politicians.&lt;ref name=Huggler14&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hugglet|first1=Justin|title=German Eurosceptics embrace anti-Islam protests|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11285422/German-Eurosceptics-embrace-anti-Islam-protests.html|accessdate=16 December 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Dresden city council's AfD faction welcomed Pegida's weekly demonstrations.&lt;ref name=DresAfD&gt;{{cite web|author1=AfD-Fraktion, Dresden|title=Erklärung der AfD-Fraktion im Stadtrat der Landeshauptstadt Dresden zu den Demonstrationen von PEGIDA|url=http://www.afd-fraktion-dresden.de/nachrichtenleser/afd-fraktion-zu-pegida.html|publisher=AfD|accessdate=5 January 2015|language=German|date=20 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105141722/http://www.afd-fraktion-dresden.de/nachrichtenleser/afd-fraktion-zu-pegida.html|archivedate=5 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josef Schuster]], chairman of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]], voiced his opposition to the group, saying that the possibility of an Islamic conquest of Germany would be as "absurd" as a [[Fourth Reich|resurrection of the Nazi regime]]. Schuster described Pegida as being "highly dangerous": “It starts with verbal assault and leads to actual attacks like the one on a planned refugee hostel in Bavaria". He referred to an arson attack on a home for asylum-seekers that was ready for occupation. After the attack, swastika graffiti was found at the scene. Schuster said that Pegida is a combination of "neo-Nazis, far-right parties and citizens who think they are finally allowed to show their racism and xenophobia openly". He condemned the movement, stating that the fear of Islamist terror was being exploited to disparage an entire religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German Council of Jews chairman condemns "immensely dangerous" PEGIDA movement|url=http://www.dw.de/german-council-of-jews-chairman-condemns-immensely-dangerous-pegida-movement/a-18143163|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aiman Mazyek from the [[Central Council of Muslims in Germany]] stated that again and again right-wing extremists gave the public the false impression of a racist Germany. The slogans of the protesters showed that xenophobia and anti-Semitic racism had become socially acceptable.{{contradict-inline|date=February 2015}}{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In November 2014, [[Saxony]]'s Interior Minister, [[Markus Ulbig]] (CDU), claimed that foreign criminals stayed in Germany too long. He announced the creation of a special police unit to deal with criminal immigrants in [[Dresden]] and the rest of Saxony. Investigators and specialists in criminal and immigrant law would collaborate to process foreign criminals in the criminal justice system, and prevent those not eligible for asylum from obtaining the right to stay in Germany.&lt;ref name="DerSpiegelAsylum"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/asylbewerber-sachsen-plant-sondereinheit-der-polizei-a-1004670.html |title= Pläne in Sachsen: Sondereinheit soll gegen straffällige Asylbewerber "durchgreifen" |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date= 24 November 2014 |accessdate= 9 January 2015 |trans-title= Plans in Saxony: Special unit to clamp down on criminal asylum seekers |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulbig admitted that there had been a number of criminal acts committed by immigrants near the homes for [[Right of asylum|asylum]]-seekers, but these were a minority and should not be allowed to undermine solidarity with the great majority of law-abiding refugees.

===Reactions from political scientists===
[[Political science|Political scientist]] Werner J.

He says that this points to a serious problem in [[society]], which neither the [[Left-wing politics|left wing]] nor parties of the [[Centrism|political middle ground]] concern themselves with. This allows new social initiatives critical of Islam and immigrants to form.&lt;ref name=FreiePresse&gt;{{cite news|last=Hach|first=Oliver|title=Pegida - oder: Die Welle.|url=http://www.freiepresse.de/NACHRICHTEN/SACHSEN/Pegida-oder-Die-Welle-artikel9048569.php|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=FreiePresse|date=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the demonstrators are normal people approachable by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]], if only the party stopped following [[ostrich policy]] concerning immigration.&lt;ref name="Le Temps"&gt;{{cite news|title=Des "patriotes" allemands se mobilizent contre l’immigration.|url=http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/1042927e-80ae-11e4-9a92-1e037d8e04b7/Des_patriotes_allemands_se_mobilizent_contre_limmigration|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Le Temps|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Far-right politics]] expert Hans-Gerd Jaschke thinks that the demands in Pegida’s position paper stem from the [[middle class]] [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] and could as well be the content of [[CDU/CSU]]’s position papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/jaschke-jetzt-ist-die-zivilgesellschaft-gefragt/a-18125144 |title=Jaschke: "Jetzt ist die Zivilgesellschaft gefragt" &amp;#124; Deutschland &amp;#124; DW.DE &amp;#124; 12.12.2014 |publisher=DW.DE |date=13 December 2014 |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social psychologist [[Andreas Zick]] from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Research on Conflict and Violence (IKG) assesses the party as a “middle-class right-wing populist movement”.&lt;ref name="Deutsche Welle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pabst|first=Sabrina|title=Jaschke: Jetzt ist die Zivilgesellschaft gefragt.|url=http://www.dw.de/jaschke-jetzt-ist-die-zivilgesellschaft-gefragt/a-18125144|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Deutsche Welle|date=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to right-wing extremism researcher Johannes Kies, Pegida states what many people think.&lt;ref name="Stuttgarter Zeitung"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lachmann|first=Harald|title=Dresden und der Pegida-Protest: Sorge um die weltoffene Stadt.|url=http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.dresden-und-der-pegida-protest-sorge-um-die-weltoffene-stadt.27d42051-6d58-427b-b801-a29fa58de02e.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Stuttgarter Zeitung|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kies says that these opinions are widespread in society and that great anti-democratic potential is erupting there.&lt;ref name=MDR&gt;{{cite news|last=Bohmann|first=Christin|title=Extremismus-Forscher: "Pegida spricht aus, was die Leute denken."|url=http://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/pegida-interview-extremismusforscher100.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=MDR|date=1 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219033820/http://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/pegida-interview-extremismusforscher100.html#|archive-date=19 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist Alexander Häusler we are facing “a right-wing oriented group of enraged citizens”, that “mingles with members of the right-wing scene and even hooligans”.&lt;ref name=tagesschau&gt;{{cite news|last=Gensing|first=Patrick|title=Pegida- und HoGeSa-Demonstrationen: Gegen Islamismus, für 'Heimatschutz'|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/pegida-103.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=tagesschau|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Hajo Funke sees a connection between Pegida and the great increase in attacks on asylum seekers in 2014. He says that because politics did not react to the population’s fear of ever-increasing numbers of asylum seekers, these groups could use these fears and fan them further.&lt;ref name="Augsburger Allgemeine"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kandzora|first=Jan|title=Proteste gegen Asyl und Islam: Das steckt hinter Pegida und Bagida.|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/Proteste-gegen-Asyl-und-Islam-Das-steckt-hinter-Pegida-und-Bagida-id32271632.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Augsburger Allgemeine|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article for the German newspaper [[Die Zeit|Zeit Online]], political scientist and historian Michael Lühmann called it “cynical to want to place Pegida in the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|tradition of 1989]]”. The demonstrators in Dresden do not align themselves with the philosophy of the extreme right-wing, he says, but they fit the bill for “extremism of the centre ground”, which is widespread in Saxony and for whose “group-based misanthropy […] at times the CDU, but prevalently the [[National Democratic Party of Germany|NPD]] and as of now the [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]] stand” in parliament.&lt;ref name="Zeit Online"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lühmann|first=Michael|title=Dresden: Pegida passt nach Sachsen.|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-12/pegida-dresden-politische-tradition|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Zeit Online|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar fashion, historian [[Götz Aly]] traces the fact that Pegida were able to form in Dresden back to the city’s history. In one of his columns in the [[Berliner Zeitung]] he referred to the [[Jewish emancipation]] of 19th century Saxony, where the comparatively few resident [[Jews]] were faced with unequally difficult legal obstacles. Aly concluded that in Dresden “[[freedom]], self-aggrandising local presumption and [[fear]] of foreigners” have long belonged together.&lt;ref name="Berliner Zeitung"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aly|first=Götz|title=Pegida, eine alte Dresdner Eigenheit.|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/meinung/kolumne-zur-fremdenangst-in-dresden-pegida--eine-alte-dresdner-eigenheit,10808020,29338774.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Berliner Zeitung|date=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political philosopher Jürgen Manemann considers Pegida an anti-political movement. According to Manemann, political action serves the [[common good]] and thus requires politicians to voice especially the interests of minorities. While politics was based on [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], Pegida was in fact anti-pluralistic and thus anti-political. In Manemann’s eyes, the movement has neither an appreciation of [[Alterity|otherness]] nor [[empathy]], which he sees as the basic virtue of political action.&lt;ref name="Philosophie Indebate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Manemann|first=Jürgen|title=InDebate: Pegida ist eine anti-politische Bewegung!|url=http://philosophie-indebate.de/2052/indebate-pegida-ist-eine-anti-politische-bewegung|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Philosophie Indebate|date=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining especially those protests against the actually non-existent threat of Islamisation from people with middle-class backgrounds, political scientist [[Gesine Schwan]] referred to results from studies on [[prejudice]]. These studies indicate that aggressive prejudices do not originate from those groups met with [[resentment]], but are rather a result of the situation of those who have them. In addition, fear of social decline often seems to be expressed through [[aggression]]. This is then directed especially against those minorities which may seem dangerous, but are in reality unable to defend themselves, often due to a perceived unpopularity within the respective society. In the first half of the 20th century, it was the Jewish minority who were imputed with plans for [[world domination]]. Today, it is the Muslim minority who is accused of plotting an Islamisation of Europe.&lt;ref name="ZeitOnlineWeimar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwan|first=Gesine|title=Fremdenhass: Pegida ist überall.|url=http://www.zeit.de/2015/01/pegida-abstiegsangst-weimarer-republik|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Zeit Online|date=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview about Pegida, researcher on prejudice [[Wolfgang Benz]] referred to his previous warnings about right-wing extremists using the fear of foreign infiltration for their ends. It was not the formation but the attendance figures that really surprised him.&lt;ref name=BR&gt;{{cite news|last=Cordsen|first=Knut|title=Patriotismus oder Vorurteile?

Political scientist and researcher on extremism Armin Pfahl-Traughber considers Pegida demonstrations "a new phenomenon of [[xenophobia]]".&lt;ref name="Endstation Rechts"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cordsen|first=Knut|title=Die Pegida-Demonstrationen als neues Phänomen für Fremdenfeindlichkeit.|url=http://www.endstation-rechts.de/news/kategorie/sonstige/artikel/die-pegida-demonstrationen-als-neues-phaenomen-fuer-fremdenfeindlichkeit.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Endstation Rechts|date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, he accused Pegida leaders of fuelling "[[hostility]] and [[hatred]] against people of different [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] or religion".&lt;ref name="Westdeutsche Zeitung"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurz|first=Peter|title=Politologe Pfahl-Traughber zu Pegida: "Bevormundung der Basis."|url=http://www.wz-newsline.de/home/politik/inland/politologe-pfahl-traughber-zu-pegida-bevormundung-der-basis-1.1828279|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Westdeutsche Zeitung|date=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2015, the Council on Migration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rat-fuer-migration.de/ |title=Rat für Migration |publisher=Rat-fuer-migration.de |date= |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; called for a new general orientation in German society. Since, in their eyes, migration was controllable only to a limited extent, they suggested an orientation committee. Consisting of politicians and representatives of immigrants and minorities, this would work together in order to analyse and redefine "German [[National identity|identity]] and [[solidarity]] in a pluralist [[Republicanism|republican]] society". Their results were to be included in German schools' curricula in order to emphasize the historical importance of [[Immigration to Germany|migration in Germany]]. In the eyes of the Council, German policy has been influenced for far too long by the CDU's guiding principle of "Germany not being a land of immigration". Thus, a concept of integration should include foreigners and refugees in German society. According to the Council, German integration policy should not only focus on immigrants, but also provide courses on integration for groups such as Pegida. Praising German Chancellor Angela Merkel's distancing herself from Pegida, the Council stressed that an immigration society is a very complex construct.&lt;ref name="Spiegel Online"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reimann|first=Anna|title=Umgang mit Pegida: Forscher fordern neues Deutschland-Bild in Lehrplänen.|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/pegida-migrationsforscher-fordern-neues-leitbild-fuer-deutschland-a-1011260.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Spiegel Online|date=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political theorist Wolfgang Jäger considers Pegida a part of increasingly right-wing populist tendencies in Europe, in their Islamophobia possibly being the heir to widespread [[antisemitism]]. He claims that the demonstrations themselves expose the movement's moderate position paper as a [[fig leaf]] for "blatantly unconstitutional xenophobia". Thus, democrats should not sympathize with the movement, as their referring in particular to Judeo-Christian values was contrary to their actual demands. Jäger also voiced concerns about the "ghosts of the old [[German nationalism|nationalism]] re-entering Germany through the back door". According to political theorists, a democracy needs to be measured by how it [[Minority rights|protects its minorities]]. A knowledge of foreign cultures should be taught in schools. Only in this way would it be possible to understand [[globalisation]] as a chance for cultural enrichment in the face of global [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Badische Zeitung"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jäger|first=Wolfgang|title=Die Gespenster des völkischen Nationalismus.|url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/meinung/kommentare/die-gespenster-des-voelkischen-nationalismus|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=Badische Zeitung|date=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International reactions===
The controversy around Pegida sparked reactions from international media as well. In France, ''[[Le Monde]]'' wrote that Islamophobia divided German society, while ''[[Libération]]'' and ''[[L'Opinion]]'' discussed possible parallels to the French far-right [[National Front (France)|Front National]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ist Pegida ein deutscher Front National?|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/frankreichs-reaktion-ist-pegida-ein-deutscher-front-national-13356464.html|website=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several French and francophone cartoonists published a flyer aimed against a funeral march by Pegida in the wake of the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]] in January 2015. The signatories - among them a surviving member of ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'''s editorial staff – disapproved of Pegida using the mourning to gather attention for their own cause. They stated that Pegida symbolized everything ''Charlie Hebdo'' had fought against and asked the population of Dresden for more tolerance and to be open towards different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Französische Karikaturisten wehren sich gegen Pegida|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2015-01/frankreich-charlie-hebdo-karrikaturen-pegida-paris-dresden|website=Die Zeit|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' claimed that, for the first time since 1945, a German populist movement was publicly complaining about an ethnic minority. This would frighten the establishment. [[BBC News]] said that Germany is not used to such large numbers of demonstrators supporting such positions.&lt;ref name="zeit.de"&gt;{{cite web|title=Das moderne Deutschland ist das nicht gewohnt|url=http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2015-01/pegida-internationale-presse|website=Die Zeit|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' described Pegida as an emerging campaign against immigrants that would eventually endanger tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ausländische Medien über Pegida: "Im Tal der Ahnungslosen"|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/pegida-und-dresden-wie-die-auslaendische-presse-die-bewegung-sieht-a-1008750.html|website=Der Spiegel|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' claimed that, because of its communist history, East Germany was more xenophobic than the rest of the country. The paper claimed that, in light of the low numbers of Muslims living in Saxony, the fear of Islamisation was bizarre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In German City Rich With History and Tragedy, Tide Rises Against Immigration|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/08/world/in-german-city-rich-with-history-and-tragedy-tide-rises-against-immigration.html?_r=0|website=International New York Times|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russia Today]] reported comprehensively on Pegida. Its subsidiary [[Ruptly]] broadcast several rallies live on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weltpresse über deutsche Islamfeinde: "Die Rhetorik von Pegida ist armselig"|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/pegida-das-sagt-die-internationale-presse-zu-den-protesten-a-1011431.html|website=Der Spiegel|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey's ''[[Hürriyet]]'' and [[Sabah (newspaper)|''Sabah'']] reported on Pegida and counterrallies. Sabah interpreted the demonstrations as a “rise of the radical right in Europe”. In an interview with the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', Turkish prime minister [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]] compared Pegida followers with members of the terror organisation IS. He said that both had an archaic mindset and that Turkey was "very concerned about Pegida". He called the movement a “threat to Turks, Muslims and Germany itself”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Türkischer Regierungschef vergleicht Pegida mit IS|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/tuerkeis-regierungschef-davutoglu-vergleicht-pegida-mit-is-13367895.html|website=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic news network [[Al Jazeera]] primarily reported on counter-demonstrations.&lt;ref name="zeit.de"/&gt;

==Offshoots and variations==

===In Germany===
Pegida has spawned a number of smaller offshoots across Germany, including ''Legida'' in [[Leipzig]], ''Sügida'' in [[Thüringen|Südthüringen]],&lt;ref name=mdr/&gt; ''Kagida'' in [[Kassel]], ''Wügida'' in [[Würzburg]], ''Bogida'' in [[Bonn]], ''Dügida'' in [[Düsseldorf]],&lt;ref name=Knight/&gt; and ''Fragida'' in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gedziorowski |first=Lukas|title=Pegida wird Fragida|url=http://www.journal-frankfurt.de/journal_news/Politik-10/Anti-Islamisierungsbewegung-kommt-nach-Frankfurt-Pegida-wird-Fragida-23358.html|accessdate=16 December 2014|publisher=Journal Frankfurt|date=15 December 2014|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some internal disputes, representatives of ''Pegida NRW'', an affiliate aiming to operate in the federal state of [[North Rhine Westphalia]], distanced itself from the ''Bogida'', ''Dügida'' and ''Kögida'' clones in North Rhine Westphalia. The latter were said to have been taken over by members of the openly xenophobic right-wing splinter party [[Pro NRW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/dresdens-pegida-buendnis-distanziert-sich-von-nrw-ablegern-13364370.html|first=Reiner|last=Burger|title=Schwarze Pädagogik, die wir nicht nötig haben|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=12 January 2015|accessdate=17 January 2015|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2015, ''Pegida NRW'' replaced their media representative Melanie Dittmer with Sebastian Nobile, a member of the ''German Defence League'', an anti-Islamist organisation modelled on the [[English Defence League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksta.de/politik/nach-scheitern-von-koegida-pegida-nrw-feuert-pressesprecherin-und-will-koeln-kuenftig-meiden,15187246,29492340.html|title=Pegida-NRW feuert Pressesprecherin und will Köln künftig meiden|work=[[Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger]]|date=6 January 2015|accessdate=17 January 2015|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, rival right-wing forces founded an [[anti-Americanism|anti-American]] Facebook group under the name PEGADA ({{lang-de|Patriotische Europäer gegen die Amerikanisierung des Abendlandes}}, or "Patriotic Europeans Against the Americanisation of the West"), claiming the true problem was not the phenomenon of Islamism but the suspected American forces behind it. On 25 January they held a first rally in Erfurt under the title ''EnDgAmE'' ({{lang|de|Engagierte Demokraten gegen die Amerikanisierung Europas}}, or "Committed democrats against the Americanisation of Europe"). Promoted by a number of activists of the [[Third Position]] ''[[Vigils for Peace|Mahnwachen]]''-Movement and by [[Hooligans against Salafists]] (''Hogesa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pegada statt Pegida|first=Horst|last=Freires|work=[[Blick nach Rechts]]|url=http://www.bnr.de/artikel/aktuelle-meldungen/pegada-statt-pegida|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=24 January 2015|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; they attracted some 1,000 protesters, but were opposed by 800 mostly left-wing counter-demonstrators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.europeonline-magazine.eu/scuffles-as-anti-american-protesters-meet-resistance-in-germany_373909.html|title=Scuffles as anti-American protesters meet resistance in Germany|work=Europe online|date=24 January 2015|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Erfurt's mayor [[Andreas Bausewein]] and trade union members, [[Jusos]] and the local [[Antifascism|Antifa]].&lt;ref name=mdr&gt;{{cite web|title=Knapp 2.000 Teilnehmer bei Kundgebungen|work=[[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]]|url=http://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/kundgebungen_erfurt102_zc-e9a9d57e_zs-6c4417e7.html|date=24 January 2015|accessdate=24 January 2015|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127085542/http://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/kundgebungen_erfurt102_zc-e9a9d57e_zs-6c4417e7.html#|archive-date=27 January 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another offshoot, Nügida, drew scrutiny after several of its members became involved in a [[2015 German refugee attack plot|neo-Nazi plot to bomb a refugee centre]].&lt;ref name="naziplot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/extremist-plot-to-bomb-german-migrant-shelters-using-highly-dangerous-explosives-uncovered|title=Police foil right-wing extremist plot to bomb German migrant shelters with ‘highly dangerous explosives’}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 350 persons were present and about 227 of them received a fine for participating in an unauthorized demonstration.

On 28 February 2015, [[Pegida UK]] held its first protest in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], with around 400 attending. Around 1,000 people turned up to oppose, led by former MP [[George Galloway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Anti-Islamisation' group Pegida UK holds Newcastle march|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-31657167|accessdate=2 March 2015|work=BBC News|date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a small Pegida demonstration in London on 4 April 2015, with a counter-demonstration by anti-fascist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dearden|first1=Lizzie|title=Pegida in London: British supporters of anti-'Islamisation' group rally in Downing Street|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/pegida-in-london-british-supporters-of-antiislamisation-group-rally-in-downing-street-10155887.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fortress Europe==
On 23 January 2016, representatives of fourteen like-minded allies, including Pegida Austria, Pegida Bulgaria, and [[Pegida Netherlands]], met with [[Lutz Bachmann]] and [[Tatjana Festerling]] in the Czech Republic to sign the [[2016 Prague Declaration|Prague Declaration]], which states their belief that the "history of Western civilisation could soon come to an end through Islam conquering Europe", thus formalizing their membership in the Fortress Europe coalition against that eventuality. Other signatories present were: Blok proti islámu, [[Conservative People's Party of Estonia|Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond]], [[Lega Nord]], Odvaha, [[Ruch Narodowy]] and [[Dawn - National Coalition|Úsvit - Národní Koalice]]. Úsvit's Marek Černoch said that the meeting was, among other things, a reaction to the [[New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany|attacks on women in Cologne]] in Germany on New Year’s Eve, which took place as celebrations were being held to usher in 2016. At the end of the Prague Declaration, above the signatures, it is stated that there would be demonstrations on 6 February 2016 to manifest their determination. Others who joined Fortress Europe or participated in Pegida-organized demonstrations are: [[Identity Ireland]], [[Pegida Ireland]], [[Pegida Switzerland]], [[Pegida UK]], [[Reclaim Australia]], and former [[French Foreign Legion]] General [[Christian Piquemal]]'s group in [[Calais]] (lists may not be comprehensive).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fortress Europe: PEGIDA to be joined by 14 anti-Islam allies for mass February protests|url=https://www.rt.com/news/330075-pegida-coalition-mass-protest/|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=[[Russia Today]]|date=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pegida meets with European allies in the Czech Republic|url=http://www.dw.com/en/pegida-meets-with-european-allies-in-the-czech-republic/a-19000895|accessdate=27 January 2016|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gutteridge|first=Nick|title=Anti-Islam groups launch Europe-wide coalition pledging to defend 'Western civilisation'|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/638910/anti-islam-groups-launch-Europe-coalition-defending-western-civilization-EDL-march-UK|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=[[Daily Express]]|date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roche|first=Barry|title=Anti-Islamic group Pegida Ireland to be launched at Dublin rally|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/anti-islamic-group-pegida-ireland-to-be-launched-at-dublin-rally-1.2515875|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dozens arrested as Pegida anti-migrant marches sweep across Europe (PHOTOS, VIDEOS)|url=https://www.rt.com/news/331586-pegida-anti-migrant-demonstrations-europe/|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=[[Russia Today]]|date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lüssi|first=Marco|title=Pegida Schweiz wirft Ignaz Bearth raus|url=http://www.20min.ch/schweiz/news/story/27858448|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=[[20 Minuten]]|date=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swiss activists plan PEGIDA anti-Muslim march amid rising tensions across Europe|url=https://www.rt.com/news/222035-swiss-pegida-anti-islamic/|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=[[Russia Today]]|date=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pegida Ireland is the Irish branch of the German-based movement Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (''{{lang|de|Patriotische Europäer gegen die Islamisierung des Abendlandes}}''; Pegida), a [[far-right]], [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] political movement.

The '''cataclysmic pole shift''' [[fringe theory]] suggests that there have been geologically rapid shifts in the relative positions of the modern-day geographic locations of the poles and the [[axis of rotation]] of the [[Earth]], creating calamities such as floods and tectonic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There is evidence of [[precession]] and changes in [[axial tilt]], but this change is on much longer time-scales and does not involve relative motion of the spin axis with respect to the planet. However, in what is known as [[true polar wander]], the solid Earth can rotate with respect to a fixed spin axis. Research shows that during the last 200 million years a total true polar wander of some 30° has occurred, but that no super-rapid shifts in the Earth's pole were found during this period.&lt;ref name=jgr107_b11/&gt; A characteristic rate of true polar wander is 1° or less per million years.&lt;ref name="jgr90" /&gt; Between approximately 790 and 810 million years ago, when the [[supercontinent]] [[Rodinia]] existed, two geologically rapid phases of true polar wander may have occurred. In each of these, the magnetic poles of the Earth shifted by approximately 55°.&lt;ref name="gsab118"&gt;{{cite journal

== Definition and clarification ==

The [[geographic pole]]s are defined by the points on the surface of the Earth that are intersected by the axis of rotation. The pole shift hypothesis describes a change in location of these poles with respect to the underlying surface – a phenomenon distinct from the changes in axial orientation with respect to the [[plane of the ecliptic]] that are caused by [[precession]] and [[nutation]], and is an amplified event of a [[true polar wander]].

Pole shift hypotheses are not connected with [[plate tectonics]], the well-accepted geological theory that the Earth's surface consists of solid plates which shift over a viscous, or semifluid [[asthenosphere]]; nor with [[continental drift]], the corollary to plate tectonics which maintains that locations of the continents have moved slowly over the face of the Earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | first=C. R. | last=Scotese | authorlink = Christopher Scotese| title=The PaleoMap Project

Pole shift hypotheses are not the same as [[geomagnetic reversal]], the periodic reversal of the Earth's magnetic field (effectively switching the north and south magnetic poles).

== Speculative history ==
In popular literature, many conjectures have been suggested involving very rapid polar shift. A slow shift in the poles would display the most minor alterations and no destruction. A more dramatic view assumes more rapid changes, with dramatic alterations of geography and localized areas of destruction due to earthquakes and tsunamis.

=== Early proponents ===

An early mention of a shifting of the Earth's axis can be found in an 1872 article entitled "Chronologie historique des Mexicains"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | title=Chronologie historique des Mexicains
 | pages=77–85 | journal=L'ethnographie
 | publisher=Société d'Ethnographie | volume=7

In 1889, [[The Purchase of the North Pole|Jules Verne]] imagined the possible consequences of artificial pole shift. 
In 1948, [[Hugh Auchincloss Brown]], an electrical engineer, advanced a hypothesis of catastrophic pole shift. Brown also argued that accumulation of ice at the poles caused recurring tipping of the axis, identifying cycles of approximately seven millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In his controversial 1950 work ''[[Worlds in Collision]]'', [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] postulated that the planet [[Venus]] emerged from [[Jupiter]] as a [[comet]]. During two proposed near approaches in about 1,450 BCE, he suggested that the direction of the Earth's rotation was changed radically, then reverted to its original direction on the next pass. This disruption supposedly caused earthquakes, [[tsunamis]], and the parting of the [[Red Sea]]. Further, he said near misses by [[Mars]] between 776 and 687 BCE also caused the Earth's axis to change back and forth by ten degrees. Velikovsky cited historical records in support of his work, although his studies were generally ridiculed by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Charles Hapgood]] is now perhaps the best remembered early proponent. In his books ''The Earth's Shifting Crust'' (1958) (which includes a foreword by [[Albert Einstein]])&lt;ref name="Hapgood1958"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles H.

Hapgood argued that shifts (of no more than 40 degrees) occurred about every 5,000 years, interrupting 20,000- to 30,000-year periods of polar stability. He cited recent North Pole locations in [[Hudson Bay]] (60°N, 73°W), the Atlantic Ocean between [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]] (72°N, 10°E) and the [[Yukon]] (63°N, 135°W).&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Brad. 'Modern Esoteric: Beyond Our Senses', San Francisco, CCC Publishing, 2014). {{ISBN|1888729503}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his subsequent work ''The Path of the Pole'', Hapgood conceded Einstein's point that the weight of the polar ice is insufficient to cause polar shift. Instead, Hapgood argued that causative forces must be located below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Flem-Ath published the results of this work in 1995 in ''When the Sky Fell'' co-written with his wife Rose.&lt;ref&gt;Flem-Ath, Rand, Flem-Ath, Rose. ''When The Sky Fell: In Search of Atlantis'' (introduction by [[Colin Wilson]], London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1995). {{ISBN|0-297-81628-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 [[Flavio Barbiero]], an engineer and explorer, theorized that shifting of the Earth's axis took place 11,000 years ago and caused what was subsequently recorded in [[myth]] as the destruction of [[Atlantis]] and [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]]. He suggested that shifting was probably caused by the impact of a comet on the Earth's surface and that the current position of Atlantis has to be sought under the [[Antarctic ice sheet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Queen Anne's Revenge''''' was an early-18th-century ship, most famously used as a [[flagship]] by the [[piracy|pirate]] [[Blackbeard]] (Edward Teach). Although the date and place of the ship's construction are uncertain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qaronline.org/history/ships-journey|title=The Pirate Ship's Journey - Queen Anne's Revenge Project|author=|date=|website=www.qaronline.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227061908/https://www.qaronline.org/history/ships-journey|archivedate=27 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is believed she was built for merchant service in Bristol in 1710 and named ''Concord''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewayofthepirates.com/pirate-life/queen-annes-revenge/|title=Queen Anne's Revenge - Story of Blackbeard's Ship|author=|date=|website=www.thewayofthepirates.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023175311/http://www.thewayofthepirates.com/pirate-life/queen-annes-revenge/|archivedate=23 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later she was captured by the French and renamed ''La Concorde''. After several years' service with the French (both as a naval [[frigate]] and as a merchant vessel - much of the time as a slave trading ship), she was captured by Blackbeard and his pirates in 1717. Blackbeard used the ship for less than a year,&lt;ref name="national geographic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0712_050712_pirateship.html |title="Blackbeard's Ship" Yields New Clues to Pirate Mystery |author=Brian Handwerk |work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=2005-07-12 |accessdate=2011-05-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015222518/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0712_050712_pirateship.html |archivedate=2011-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but captured numerous [[prize (law)|prizes]] using her as his flagship.

In May 1718, [[Blackbeard]] ran the ship aground at Beaufort Inlet, [[North Carolina]], in the present-day [[Carteret County, North Carolina|Carteret County]].&lt;ref name="national geographic"/&gt; After the grounding, her crew and supplies were transferred to smaller ships. In 1996 Intersal, Inc., a private firm, discovered the remains of a vessel that was later determined to be ''Queen Anne's Revenge'', which was added to the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==History==
The 200-ton vessel, originally named ''Concord'', was a cargo and merchant vessel believed to have been built in 1710. She was captured in 1711 by the French warships ''Élisabeth'' and ''Hampton'' (both ships were also originally British and had been captured at an earlier date), and was fitted out as a French light [[frigate]], with her name now spelt ''Concorde''. She was handed over to [[René Duguay-Trouin]] and employed in his service for some time before being converted into a slave ship, now operated by the leading slave trader René Montaudin of Nantes, until sold in 1713 in Peru or Chile. She was briefly re-acquired by the French Navy in November 1716, but was sold by them for commerce five months later in France, again for use as a slaver.&lt;ref&gt;Rif Winfield (2017), ''French Warships in the Age of Sail 1626-1786: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates'', p.234. Seaforth Publishing, Barnsley. {{ISBN|978-1-4738-9351-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She was captured by [[Blackbeard]] and his pirates on 28 November 1717, near the island of [[Saint Vincent (Antilles)|Saint Vincent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qaronline.org/history/ships-journey|title=The Pirate Ship's Journey {{!}} Queen Anne's Revenge Project|website=www.qaronline.org|access-date=2017-12-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023174935/https://www.qaronline.org/history/ships-journey|archivedate=2017-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After selling her cargo of slaves at Martinique, Blackbeard made ''La Concorde'' into his [[flagship]], adding more heavy [[cannon]] and renaming her ''Queen Anne's Revenge''. The name may come from the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], known in the Americas as [[Queen Anne's War]], in which Blackbeard had served in the [[Royal Navy]], or possibly from sympathy for [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], the last [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republicofpirates.net/Blackbeard.html|title=Blackbeard (Edward Thatch) Biography -- The Republic of Pirates|author=|date=|website=www.republicofpirates.net|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021182602/http://www.republicofpirates.net/Blackbeard.html|archivedate=21 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackbeard sailed this ship from the west coast of Africa to the Caribbean, attacking British, Dutch, and Portuguese merchant ships along the way.

Shortly after blockading [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] harbor in May 1718, and refusing to accept the [[Governor]]'s offer of a pardon, Blackbeard ran ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' aground while entering Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina on 10 June 1718. A deposition given by the former captain of ''Adventure'', David Herriot, states "Thatch's [Teach's] ship ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' run a-ground off of the Bar of Topsail-Inlet." He also states that ''Adventure'' "run a-ground likewise about Gun-shot from the said Thatch" in an attempt to kedge ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' off the bar.&lt;ref name="D. Moore. 1997 pp. 31"&gt;D.

(North Carolina Maritime History Council)&lt;/ref&gt; Teach then disbanded his flotilla and escaped by transferring supplies onto the smaller sloop, ''Adventure''. He stranded several crew members on a small island nearby, where they were later rescued by Captain [[Stede Bonnet]]. Some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cordingly, David|title=Life Among The Pirates|publisher=Abacus|location=London, England|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest Blackbeard deliberately grounded the ship as an excuse to disperse the crew. Shortly afterward, Blackbeard did surrender and accepted a royal [[pardon]] for himself and his remaining crewmen from Governor [[Charles Eden (politician)|Charles Eden]] at [[Bath, North Carolina]]. However, he eventually returned to piracy and was killed in combat in November 1718.&lt;ref name="D. Moore. 1997 pp. 31"/&gt;

Recognizing the significance of ''Queen Anne's Revenge'', the [[North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources]] (NCDNCR), Intersal, and Maritime Research Institute (MRI) entered into a memorandum of agreement in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queen Anne's Revenge Fact Sheet|url=http://www.qaronline.org/Portals/3/Documents/QAR%20Fact%20Sheet%202014.pdf|website=qaronline.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004101014/http://www.qaronline.org/Portals/3/Documents/QAR%20Fact%20Sheet%202014.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersal agreed to forego entitlement to any coins and precious metals recovered from the wreck site in order that all artifacts remain as one intact collection, and in order for NCDNCR to determine the ultimate disposition of the artifacts.

The State of North Carolina owns the wreck since it lies in state waters (within the three-mile limit).

For one week in 2000 and 2001, live [[Underwater videography|underwater video]] of the project was [[webcast]] to the [[Internet]] as a part of the ''QAR DiveLive''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll22/id/695248|title=Live from Morehead City, it's Queen Anne's Revenge :: State Publications|author=|date=|website=digital.ncdcr.gov|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021055900/http://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll22/id/695248|archivedate=21 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; educational program that reached thousands of children around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C Southerly and J Gillman-Bryan. |title=Diving on the Queen Anne's Revenge |journal=In: SF Norton (ed).

In November 2006 and 2007, more artifacts were discovered at the site and brought to the surface. The additional artifacts appear to support the claim that the wreck is that of ''Queen Anne's Revenge''. Among evidence to support this theory is that the cannons were found loaded. In addition, there were more cannons than would be expected for a ship of this size, and the cannons were of different makes. Depth markings on the part of the stern that was recovered point to it having been made according to the French foot measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secrets of the Dead: Blackbeard's Lost Ship|url=http://video.pbs.org/video/1208271760/|publisher=PBS|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620132528/http://video.pbs.org/video/1208271760|archivedate=2010-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine cannonballs, [[bar shot]] halves, an iron bolt and a [[grenado]] were also recovered during the 2014 field season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pirate Blackbeard's Newly Recovered Cannon to be Shared with Public|url=http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/june-2013/article/pirate-blackbeard-s-newly-recovered-cannon-to-be-shared-with-public|accessdate=12 June 2015|publisher=Popular Archaeology|date=October 31, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230170548/http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/june-2013/article/pirate-blackbeard-s-newly-recovered-cannon-to-be-shared-with-public|archivedate=30 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, sixteen fragments of paper were identified after being recovered from sludge inside a cannon. The scraps were from a copy of the book ''[[A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World|A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, Perform’d in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711]]'' by Captain Edward Cooke; it is likely the pages were torn from the book and used as [[wadding]] in that cannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Rare Scraps of Paper Unearthed in the Sludge of Famed Pirate Ship|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/discovery-shows-pirates-liked-read-about-sailing-expeditions-180967775/|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|date=January 9, 2018|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ronde''' (''round'' in French) is a kind of script in which the heavy strokes are nearly upright, giving the characters when taken together a round look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |year=1913 |title=Webster's Dictionary |trans-title= |url= |access-date=|dead-url= |format= |language=English |location= |publisher= |page= |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronde script appeared in France at the end of the 16th century, and was popularized by writing masters such as [[Louis Barbedor]] in the 17th century. In its original form, it borrowed some of its letterforms from the [[Rotunda (script)|round Gothic style]]. This style of writing was still in use (with some modifications) until the 20th century because it was used in French school manuals to teach the bases of cursive writing. It was also commonly used by the scribes of the [[French Ministry of Finance]] until right after World War II,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Marc H.|date=|year=2008|title=Du manuscrit à la typographie numérique : présent et avenir des écritures anciennes|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00646804/|journal=Gazette du Livre Médiéval|publisher=CNRS|volume=|issue=52-53|pages=51–78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave this style the name of ''écriture ronde finnancière'' (''round financial writing'', not to be confused with the ''financière'' writing style).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/654540|title=The history and technique of lettering|last=1901-1995.|first=Nesbitt, Alexander,|date=1957|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=9780486204277|edition=[New Dover ed.]|location=New York|oclc=654540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic French rondes where also very present in the work of 18th century type founder and calligrapher [[Nicholas Gando]], which has been revived for the digital medium by way of the French 111 font.&lt;ref&gt;Published by the [[Bitstream]] type foundry in 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roy Simon Bryce-Laporte''' (born Roy Laporte; September 7, 1933 in [[Panama City]] – July 30, 2012 in [[Sykesville, Maryland]]) was a [[sociologist]] who established one of the first [[African-American studies]] departments.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;Douglas Martin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/nyregion/roy-bryce-laporte-who-led-black-studies-program-at-yale-dies-at-78.html "Roy S. Bryce-Laporte, Who Led Black Studies at Yale, Dies at 78"] (obituary), ''[[New York Times]]'', Aug. 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy Simon Laporte was born and raised in the Republic of Panama, of a family of mixed West Indian and African ancestry.&lt;ref name="colgateobit"&gt;Rebecca Costello, [http://blogs.colgate.edu/2012/08/roy-bryce-laporte-former-colgate-alst-director-and-professor-passes-away.html "Roy Bryce-Laporte, ex-ALST director and professor, dies"] (obituary), ''Colgate University News'', Aug. 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryce-Laporte attended the [[University of Panama]], earning an associate degree, before earning bachelor's and master's degrees from the [[University of Nebraska at Lincoln]] and studying at the [[University of Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;  He completed a Ph.D. in sociology at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

He taught at [[Hunter College]] at [[CUNY]] and then at [[Yale]], before becoming the founding director of [[Yale]]'s department of African-American studies, established in 1969.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Wendell Bell, ''Memories of the Future'', "A Time of Change at Yale", pp.184-186, for recollections of the hiring process.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Yale department's approach to African-American studies, and Bryce-Laporte's as well, centered not just on African-American history in the United States but on African experience in the entire Western hemisphere (the [[hemispheric studies]] approach) and what has come to be called the [[African diaspora]].&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;  Bryce-Laporte's research centered on the experiences of Black immigrants in the United States.&lt;ref name="jbhe"&gt;[http://www.jbhe.com/2012/08/in-memoriam-roy-simon-bryce-laporte-1933-2012/ "In Memoriam: Roy Simon Bryce-Laporte, 1933-2012"], ''Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'', Aug. 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Yale, Bryce-Laporte taught at a variety of institutions including [[College of Staten Island]] at CUNY, [[Syracuse University]], [[Catholic University of America]], [[Howard University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Colorado College]].&lt;ref name="colgateobit" /&gt;  He was the founding director of [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s Research Institute on Immigration and Ethnic Studies.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;  In 1989 Bryce-Laporte joined the faculty at [[Colgate University]] as [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur]] Professor of Sociology and Anthropology, and director of its Africana and Latin American studies program.&lt;ref name="jbhe" /&gt;

He was married to Dorotea Lowe Bryce and companions with Marian D. Holness, and parented three children.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

Would they be recognized as members of an immigrant group or just simply as black?  Over 30 years after the publication of ''The Negro Immigrant'', Roy Bryce-Laporte addressed these issues in a pivotal ''Journal of Black Studies'' article in which he put forward the notion of double invisibility as applied to immigrants of African descent. He argued that as blacks and as black foreigners they suffered more inequality and greater levels of pressure concerning questions of identity than either native-born blacks or European immigrants."&lt;ref&gt;in Reed Ueda, editor, ''A Companion to American Immigration'')&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

'''''Saint Philip''''' is an [[Carrara marble|Apuan marble]] statue of [[Philip the Apostle]] by [[Nanni di Banco]]. It forms part of a cycle of fourteen sculptures commissioned for the external niches of [[Orsanmichele]] in [[Florence]], each showing the patron saint of one of the city's guilds. It is 2.5 m high and was commissioned by the Arte dei Calzolai. Completed around 1410-1412, it is now in the [[Museo di Orsanmichele]], although a replica fills its original niche.

In [[law]], a '''secondary authority''' is an authority purporting to explain the meaning or applicability of the actual verbatim texts of [[Primary authority|primary authorities]] (such as [[constitution]]s, [[statute]]s, [[case law]], [[Administrative law|administrative]] [[regulation]]s, [[Delegated legislation|executive orders]], [[Treaty|treaties]], or similar [[legal instrument]]s).

Some secondary authority materials are written and published by governments to explain the laws in simple, non-technical terms, while other secondary authority materials are written and published by private companies, non-profit organizations, or other groups or individuals. Some examples of secondary authority are:

*[[Law review]] articles, comments and notes (written by law professors, practicing lawyers, law students, etc.)
*Legal textbooks, such as [[legal treatise]]s and [[hornbooks]]
*Legal digests, such as the [[West American Digest System]]
*Annotations published in statute books, [[Code (law)|codes]], or other materials, such as the annotations in the [[American Law Reports]] series
*[[Legal encyclopedia]]s (such as [[Corpus Juris Secundum]], [[Encyclopedia of Law]] and [[American Jurisprudence]])
*Legal dictionaries (such as [[Black's Law Dictionary]]). See [[Law Dictionary (disambiguation)|Law Dictionary]]
*[[Restatement of the Law|Restatements of the Law]] published by the [[American Law Institute]]
*Legal briefs and memoranda;
*Tax forms and instructions published by governments
*Government publications explaining or summarizing the laws
*Government employee manuals (such as the [[Internal Revenue Manual]] for employees of the [[Internal Revenue Service]])
*Course materials from continuing legal education seminars
*Debate in [[legislature]]s, including such commentaries published in the [[Congressional Record]] (this may reveal [[legislative intent]])
*Other similar materials

In the United States, various legal scholars disagree over whether legislative histories in the form of texts of congressional committee reports should be considered to be secondary authority or, alternatively, primary authority.&lt;ref&gt;Compare G.L. Richmond, ''Federal Tax Research: Guide to Materials and Techniques'', page 2, fn.4 (4th ed. 1990) and C.L. Kunz, D.A. Schmedemann, C.P. Erlinder &amp; M.P. Downs, ''The Process of Legal Research'', page 3 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although secondary authorities are sometimes used in [[legal research]] (especially, to allow a researcher to gain a preliminary, overall understanding of an unfamiliar area of law) and are sometimes even cited by courts in deciding cases, secondary authorities are generally afforded less weight than the actual texts of primary authority.

}}'''''The Firesign Theatre's Box of Danger''': The Complete Nick Danger Casebook'' is a four-[[compact disk|CD]] [[boxed set]] of most recorded material by comedy group [[The Firesign Theatre]] containing their fictional character [[Nick Danger]], portrayed by [[Phil Austin]]. Danger is a [[parody]] of the [[hard-boiled|hard-boiled detective]] genre, and is often announced as "Nick Danger, [[Third eye|Third Eye]]", a parody of the term ''[[private investigator|private eye]]''. Danger stories involve stereotypical [[film noir]] situations, including mistaken identity, betrayal, and [[femme fatale]]s. Danger originally appeared on the 1969 album ''[[How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All]]'', and was reprised in various live shows, radio appearances and albums, including the 1979 ''[[Nick Danger: The Case of the Missing Shoe]]'', 1984 ''[[The Three Faces of Al]]'', and 2001 ''[[The Bride of Firesign]]''.

==Disc one==
===''The Further Adventures of Nick Danger''===
Danger debuts in a 28:11 track on side 2 of the 1969 album ''[[How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All]]''. This is an episode titled "Cut 'Em Off at the Past", of a mock radio program purportedly aired on December 6, 1941. Rocky Rococo comes to Danger's office and attempts to sell him the ring Danger gave Nancy back in college. Danger goes to the mansion where Nancy lives and meets her butler Catherwood. After knocking Danger unconscious, Catherwood and Nancy murder Rococo, who is blackmailing them. They attempt to frame Danger for their crime, but Danger forces Catherwood to reveal the truth, and solves his problem by some means we will never know; the show is interrupted by the news bulletin of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (Bergman) announcing the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;The liner notes actually say the program aired on December 6, 1941, even though the Pearl Harbor attack occurred on December 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Young Guy Motor Detective''===
On the 1972 live album ''[[Not Insane or Anything You Want To]]'', the group presented a [[self-parody]] of Nick Danger. This has Austin playing the title role as a Japanese detective Young Guy, Proctor as his Japanese girlfriend Miki, Ossman as the detective's robotic Japanese butler Rotonoto, and Bergman as American police Lieutenant Brad Shaw.

===''School For Actors''===
In 1976, while Proctor and Bergman went on sabbatical from The Firesign Theatre to produce a live show, Austin and Ossman produced a two-act live show, ''Radio Laffs of 1940''. Act one pits Danger against a cabal of Nazi spies conspiring to remake America by converting its radio drama to [[Dadaism|dadaist]] [[surreal humor]]. Bergman's absence forced the omission of Lieutenant Bradshaw, and Ossman voiced all the non-Danger roles, including several females.

==Disc two==
===''The Case of the Missing Shoe''===
{{Main|Nick Danger: The Case of the Missing Shoe}}
In 1979, the Firesign Theatre produced five short (2:24) episodes of a prospective comic radio serial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nick Danger: The Case of the Missing Shoe: Track listing|url=http://firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=cotms-tl|website=Firesign Media|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (similar to the 1960s syndicated ''[[Chickenman (radio series)|Chickenman]]''). These were released by [[Rhino Records]] on a 12:00 [[Extended play|EP]] record.

===''Frame Me Pretty''===
====Part 1: "Straight Up"====
====Part 2: "With a Twist"====
====Part 3: "On the Rocks"====

===''The Case of the Missing General''===

===''Nick Danger Meets E.T.''===

==Disc three==
===''The Three Faces of Al''===
{{Main|The Three Faces of Al}}
This 1984 album was produced without David Ossman, who had temporarily left to produce shows for [[National Public Radio]]. This story is inspired by a line in the original "Cut 'Em Off at the Past" where Bradshwaw tells Danger, "You're lucky we didn't burn ya on the [[Anselmo (disambiguation)|Anselmo]] [[pederasty]] case." Bradshaw has realized his dream to become District Attorney, and gets his chance to prosecute Danger, who is the apparent suspect in the murder of mob boss Anselmo Von Pederazzi. Nancy and Rocky Rococo also appear.

===''Back From the Shadows''===
{{Main|Back From the Shadows}}
All four Firesigns reunited for their second wave in 1993 with a 25th anniversary reunion tour. On November 11, they gave a live performance of the original Nick Danger "Cut 'Em Off At The Past" at [[Keswick Theatre]] in Glenside, Pennsylvania. This performance was originally released on the reunion tour album in June 1994.

===''Shack Out On the Alien Highway''===
In October 2001, the Firesign Theatre got a series on [[XM Satellite Radio]] titled ''Fools In Space''. They produced seven serial Nick Danger episodes for this show, the first three broadcast on October 27, November 17, and December 15.

====''Part 1: "Nick Begins the Case"''====
====''Part 2: "The Case Continues"''====
====''Part 3: "The Suspects Seque"''====

==Disc four==
===''Shack Out On the Alien Highway'' (continued)===
The XM Satellite show ''Fools In Space'' continued through August 2002. Four more Nick Danger episodes were broadcast on January 26, February 23, April 27, and August 24.

====''Part 4: "Shack-Out"''====
====''Part 5: "Shack-In"''====
====''Part 6: "Six Months Later"''====
====''Part 7: "Where Were We Now?"''====

===''All Things Firesign''===
{{Main|All Things Firesign}}
The Firesigns performed approximately once a month on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]'' news program from July 2002 to April 2003, released on a CD album in 2003. Two performances, on October 3 and December 24, featured Nick Danger. The Christmas Eve show featured a parody of the poem ''[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]''.

====''Lucky Liability''====
====''A St. Nick Dangerous Christmas Eve''====

===''Snakehead Symphony''===
===''Scaled Down Danger''===

==Other appearances==
Nick Danger also appeared on a track of the 2001 album ''[[Bride of Firesign]]'', the third installment of the ''We're Doomed'' trilogy. This was not included in the ''Box of Danger''.

'''Varsity Brands''' is a private company in the [[United States]]. The company produces apparel and equipment for [[American football|football]] and 11 other sports; class rings, graduation regalia, jewelry and yearbooks, and motivation and recognition tools and resources; cheerleading, and [[dance]] activities, with subsidiary units and programs that regulate and administer most organized collegiate cheerleading and dance activities within the United States &lt;ref&gt; https://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2014/06/03/rebranding-spreads-varsity-name-around.html/&lt;/ref&gt;.  Involvement in cheerleading and dance activities includes its ownership of subsidiaries and programs that conduct competitions and camps.  Notably, the breadth of influence Varsity Brands Inc. possesses over cheerleading and dance activities has led to discussion of potential conflicts of interest including its interests related to the issue of the classification of competitive cheerleading as a sport in the United States.&lt;ref name="USDistCourt"&gt;Biediger, et al., v. Quinnipiac Univ., pp. 31-32 http://courtweb.pamd.uscourts.gov/courtwebsearch/ctxc/KX330R32.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P_and_T"&gt;Penn and Teller, "Bullshit: Cheerleading" Season 8, Episode 1 http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/episodes.do?episodeid=136409&amp;ep=801 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701070753/http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/episodes.do?episodeid=136409&amp;ep=801 |date=2010-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varsity Brands Inc. is based in Farmers Branch, Texas, and is made up of three companies: [[Varsity Spirit]], which sells uniforms, hosts competitions, and runs instructional cheerleading and dance camps; [[Herff Jones]], which is a provider of graduation and educations products such as class rings, [[jewelry]], caps and gowns, yearbooks and recognition products; and BSN Sports, a distributor of sports uniforms and equipment.&lt;ref name="Rebranding"&gt;Rebranding Spreads Varsity Name Around http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2014/06/03/rebranding-spreads-varsity-name-around.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

Varsity Brands made news in 2014 when it began negotiations to be acquired by [[Charlesbank Capital Partners]], a private equity group.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;&lt;&lt;Wall Street Journal, https://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/11/04/the-morning-leverage-charlesbank-and-partners-group-get-their-varsity-letters/&gt;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2018, when it was announced that Bain Capital Private Equity would be acquiring the company &lt;ref&gt; https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-19/bain-capital-to-acquire-varsity-brands-from-charlesbank-capital.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Blumenfeld, who served as CEO of BSN Sports since 2007, was named CEO of Varsity Brands in 2017 &lt;ref
&gt; url=https://www.dallasnews.com/business/business/2015/02/27/the-biggest-distributor-of-sports-apparel-footwear-and-equipment-is-right-here-in-farmers-branch.html/&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Varsity Brands has partnered with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital as part of their “Team Up for St. Jude, Spirited by Varsity” campaign, and has raised $5 million to date. They have provided caps, gowns and achievement products for the St. Jude School Program by Chili’s, implemented a fundraising letter campaign at summer camps, donated a percentage of sales of select items, coordinated pep rallies and volunteer events, and participated in the St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer and the St. Jude Memphis Marathon  &lt;ref&gt; https://www.stjude.org/get-involved/school-fundraising-ideas/high-school/varsity.html)&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Potential conflicts of interest==
While holding an interest in the business of cheerleading apparel, Varsity Brands Inc. owns subsidiaries and programs:
* Responsible for conducting national cheerleading competitions, where scoring systems are intertwined with promotion of Varsity Brand's products.  A recent court decision provides an example: "During the “spirit” portion of the competition, cheerleading teams are awarded points for using props, such as pom poms, sold by Varsity Brands; the more props a team uses, the more points that team receives".&lt;ref name="USDistCourt" /&gt;
* Overseeing and certifying practitioners responsible for safety in cheerleading activities.&lt;ref name="P_and_T" /&gt;
* Institutionalizing high financial costs for participation in forms of competitive cheerleading.&lt;ref name="P_and_T"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CSciMonitor"&gt;"Cheerleading may not be a sport, but it is an industry" http://www.csmonitor.com/Money/new-economy/2010/0722/Cheerleading-may-not-be-a-sport-but-it-is-an-industry&lt;/ref&gt;

These conflicts of interest were a main focus of Season 8, episode 1 of [[List of Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit! episodes#Season 8: 2010|''Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!'']]

==Programs and subsidiaries==
Programs and subsidiaries of Varsity Brands Inc. include:
