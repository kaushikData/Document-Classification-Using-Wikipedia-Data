'''2,4-Dinitrophenol''' ('''2,4-DNP''' or simply '''DNP''') is an organic compound with the formula HOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a yellow, crystalline solid that has a sweet, musty odor. It sublimes, is volatile with steam, and is soluble in most organic solvents as well as aqueous alkaline solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21297020|title=The Merck index : an encyclopedia of chemicals, drugs, and biologicals|last=|first=|date=1989|publisher=Merck|others=Budavari, Susan.|year=|isbn=091191028X|edition=11th ed., centennial|location=Rahway, N.J., U.S.A.|pages=1900|oclc=21297020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a precursor to other chemicals and is biochemically active, inhibiting energy ([[adenosine triphosphate]], ATP) production in cells with mitochondria.

==Biochemical aspects==
In living cells, DNP acts as a proton [[ionophore]], an agent that can shuttle [[protons]] (hydrogen cations) across biological membranes. It dissipates the proton gradient across [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]] membranes, collapsing the [[proton motive force]] that the cell uses to produce most of its [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] chemical energy. Instead of producing ATP, the energy of the proton gradient is lost as heat.&lt;ref name="PMC3550200Tab1" /&gt;

DNP is often used in [[biochemistry]] research to help explore the [[bioenergetics]] of [[Chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] and other [[membrane transport]] processes.

===Health effects===
DNP is considered to have high [[acute toxicity]].&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;  Acute oral exposure to DNP has resulted in increased basal metabolic rate, nausea, vomiting, sweating, dizziness, headache, and loss of weight.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;  Chronic oral exposure to DNP can lead to the formation of cataracts and [[skin lesion]]s and has caused effects on the [[bone marrow]], [[central nervous system]], and [[cardiovascular system]].&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry | title = Toxicological Profile for Dinitrophenols | author = Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | date = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dieting aid===
DNP was used extensively in [[Anti-obesity medication|diet pills]] from 1933 to 1938 after Cutting and Tainter at Stanford University made their first report on the drug's ability to greatly increase metabolic rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cutting WC, Mehrtens HG, Tainter ML | title = Actions and uses of dinitrophenol: Promising metabolic applications | journal = [[J Am Med Assoc]] | year = 1933 | volume = 101 | issue = 3 | pages =  193–195 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1933.02740280013006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tainter ML, Stockton AB, Cutting WC | title = Use of dinitrophenol in obesity and related conditions: a progress report | journal = [[J Am Med Assoc]] | year = 1933 | volume = 101 | issue = 19 | pages =  1472–1475 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1933.02740440032009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After only its first year on the market Tainter estimated that at least 100,000 people had been treated with DNP in the United States, in addition to many others abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Tainter ML, Cutting WC, Stockton AB | title = Use of Dinitrophenol in Nutritional Disorders : A Critical Survey of Clinical Results | journal = [[Am J Public Health]] | year = 1934 | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages =  1045–1053 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.24.10.1045 | pmc = 1558869 | pmid = 18014064 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1558869/pdf/amjphnation00921-0049.pdf | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNP acts as a [[protonophore]], allowing protons to leak across the inner [[mitochondrial membrane]] and thus bypass [[ATP synthase]]. This makes ATP energy production less efficient. In effect, part of the energy that is normally produced from cellular respiration is wasted as heat. The inefficiency is proportional to the dose of DNP that is taken. As the dose increases and energy production is made more inefficient, metabolic rate increases (and more fat is burned) in order to compensate for the inefficiency and to meet energy demands. DNP is probably the best known agent for uncoupling [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The "[[phosphorylation]]" of [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) by ATP synthase gets disconnected or "uncoupled" from oxidation.

The factor that limits ever-increasing doses of DNP is not a lack of ATP energy production, but rather an excessive rise in body temperature due to the heat produced during uncoupling. Accordingly, DNP overdose will cause fatal [[hyperthermia]], with body temperature rising to as high as {{convert|44|C|F}} shortly before death. In light of this, when it was used clinically, the dose was slowly [[Dosing|titrated]] according to personal tolerance, which varies greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Simkins S. | title = Dinitrophenol and desiccated thyroid in the treatment of obesity: a comprehensive clinical and laboratory study | journal = [[J Am Med Assoc]] | year = 1937 | volume = 108 | pages = 2110–2117 | doi=10.1001/jama.1937.02780250024006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Case reports have shown that an acute administration of 20–50&amp;nbsp;mg per kilogram of body weight in humans can be lethal.&lt;ref name="pmid16035205"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hsiao AL, Santucci KA, Seo-Mayer P |title=Pediatric fatality following ingestion of dinitrophenol: postmortem identification of a "dietary supplement" |journal=Clin Toxicol |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=281–285 |year=2005 |pmid=16035205 |url= |doi=10.1081/clt-200058946|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest published fatal ingested dose is 4.3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name="pmid21739343" /&gt; Concerns about dangerous side-effects and rapidly developing [[cataracts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Study of Dinitrophenol and Its Relation to Cataract Formation | pmc=1315023 | pmid=16693262 | volume=39 | year=1941 | journal=Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc | pages=405–37 | vauthors=Horner WD}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in DNP being discontinued in the United States by the end of 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colman|first=Eric|date=July 2007|title=Dinitrophenol and obesity: an early twentieth-century regulatory dilemma|journal=[[Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology]]|volume=48|issue=2|pages=115–117|doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2007.03.006|issn=0273-2300|pmid=17475379}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNP, however, continues to be used by some [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]] and athletes to rapidly lose body fat.

Although DNP is widely considered too dangerous for clinical use, its [[mechanism of action]] remains under investigation as a potential approach for treating obesity.&lt;ref name="pmid12119996"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harper JA, Dickinson K, Brand MD |title=Mitochondrial uncoupling as a target for drug development for the treatment of obesity |journal=Obesity Reviews |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=255–265 |year=2001 |pmid=12119996 |doi =10.1046/j.1467-789X.2001.00043.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, research is being conducted on [[uncoupling protein]]s naturally found in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Busiello|first=Rosa A.|last2=Savarese|first2=Sabrina|last3=Lombardi|first3=Assunta|date=2015-02-10|title=Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins and energy metabolism|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fphys.2015.00036|issn=1664-042X|pmc=4322621|pmid=25713540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom's [[Food Standards Agency]] identifies DNP as "an industrial chemical known to have serious short-term and long-term effects, which can be extremely dangerous to human health." and advises "consumers not to take any product containing DNP at any level. This chemical is not suitable for human consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warning about 'fat-burner' substances containing DNP|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2012/nov/dnp-warning#.UXZBuJWTAYM|publisher=Food Standards Agency|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacokinetics===
Information about [[pharmacokinetics]] of DNP in humans is limited and conflicting. The EPA states that "Data on the elimination kinetics of the dinitrophenols or their metabolic products in humans were not found."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] | title = Ambient water quality criteria for nitrophenols, 440/5-80-063 | url = http://www.epa.gov/ost/pc/ambientwqc/nitrophenols80.pdf |format=PDF| year = 1980| accessdate= 9 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ATSDR]]'s Toxicological Profile for Dinitrophenols also states that "No studies were located regarding distribution in humans after oral exposure to 2,4-DNP. Limited information is available regarding distribution in animals after oral exposure to 2,4-DNP." However, they do state that "Elimination from the body appears to be rapid, except possibly in cases of compromised liver function."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Harris, M. O. |author2=Cocoran, J. J. | year = 1995 | title = Toxicological Profile for Dinitrophenols | publisher = [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] | url = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=729&amp;tid=132 | accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincides with a review in the NEJM on the biological actions of dinitrophenol, which stated that "Judging from the metabolic response, DNP appears to be eliminated entirely in three or four days; in the presence of liver or kidney damage it is possible that the drug will be retained over a longer period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM193408302110901 | author = Edsall, G. | year = 1934 | title = Biological actions of dinitrophenol and related compounds: a review | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 211 | pages =  385–390 | issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oddly, more recent papers give an array of possible half-lives, ranging from 3 hours,&lt;ref name="pmid16045446"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Korde AS, Pettigrew LC, Craddock SD, Maragos WF |title=The mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol attenuates tissue damage and improves mitochondrial homeostasis following transient focal cerebral ischemia |journal=J. Neurochem. |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=1676–1684 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16045446 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-4159.2005.03328.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 5–14 days.&lt;ref name="pmid16035205" /&gt; Other recent papers maintain that the half-life in humans is unknown.&lt;ref name="GermanDeath" /&gt;

Although further investigation is needed, one case report notes that dinitrophenol-induced hyperthermia has been successfully resolved with [[dantrolene]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar S, Barker K, Seger D | year = 2002 | title = Dinitrophenol-Induced Hyperthermia Resolving With Dantrolene Administration. Abstracts of the North American Congress of Clinical Toxicology | url = | journal = Clin Toxicol | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 599–673 | doi=10.1081/clt-120016859}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Dinitrophenol uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, causes release of calcium from mitochondrial stores and prevents calcium re-uptake. This leads to free intracellular calcium and causes muscle contraction and hyperthermia. Dantrolene inhibits calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which reduces intracellular calcium. The resulting muscle relaxation allows heat dissipation. There is little risk to dantrolene administration. Since dantrolene may be effective in reducing hyperthermia caused by agents that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation, early administration may improve outcome."&lt;ref name="pmid16749560"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barker K, Seger D, Kumar S |title=Comment on "Pediatric fatality following ingestion of Dinitrophenol: postmortem identification of a 'dietary supplement'" |journal=Clin Toxicol |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=351 |year=2006 |pmid=16749560 |doi= 10.1080/15563650600584709|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commerce==
In 2003, a vendor of DNP was sentenced to prison for [[mail and wire fraud|mail fraud]], with the FDA's [[Office of Criminal Investigations|OCI]] investigators having gathered evidence that the vendor's [[capsule (pharmacy)|encapsulation]] of DNP was neither accurate nor sanitary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/EnforcementStory/EnforcementStoryArchive/ucm096380.htm|title = Office of Criminal Investigation 2003|date = 8 Jun 2015|accessdate = 10 Sep 2015|website = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a seller in [[United Kingdom]] was convicted of [[Manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] for selling DNP as "fatburner" for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.harrow.gov.uk/news/article/673/harrow_council_wins_landmark_dnp_manslaughter_case|title=Harrow Council wins landmark DNP manslaughter case|last=|first=|date=2018-06-27|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental effects==
DNP is considered an important environmental contaminant by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. It has been found in 61 of 1400 priority sites that need clean-up of industrial waste. It can enter the air from automobile exhaust, burning of certain industrial substances, and from reaction of nitrogen in air with other atmospheric chemicals. The major site of degradation is the soil, where microorganisms metabolize it.

However, the effects of DNP on [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] micro-organisms are still largely undetermined. Some studies suggest that there is anaerobic toxicity due to a reduced methane production.

{{History of Morocco}}
The '''Moroccan protests''' are a series of demonstrations across [[Morocco]] which occurred from 20 February 2011 to the spring of 2012. They were inspired by [[Arab Spring|other protests in the region]].&lt;ref name="businessweek Unrest Spreads"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hatem|first=Mohammed|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-16/bahrain-yemen-libya-face-protests-as-region-s-unrest-spreads.html|title=Bahrain, Yemen, Libya Face Protests as Region’s Unrest Spreads|work= Business Week|date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests were organized by the '''20 February Movement'''.

==Origin==
The protests in Morocco were inspired by the [[Arab Spring]] protests and revolutions in other North African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxAzDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97|title=Morocco: Challenges to Tradition and Modernity|last=Sater|first=James N.|date=2016-05-20|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317573982|location=|pages=97|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were centred around demands for political reform, which included reform against police brutality, electoral fraud, political censorship and high unemployment.

==Timeline==

===2011===
On 20 February, thousands of Moroccans rallied in the capital, [[Rabat]], to demand that King Mohammed give up some of his powers, chanting slogans such as "Down with autocracy" and "The people want to change the constitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703498804576156180408970252?mod=googlenews_wsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Marc | last=Champion | title=Morocco Joins in, Defying Predictions | date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were heading towards the parliament building, and police did not halt them, although Moroccan Finance Minister Salaheddine Mezouar said that people should not join the march. A separate protest was underway in [[Casablanca]] and one was planned for [[Marrakesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12518116 |title=Morocco protesters demand political change |work=BBC |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=20 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110221024225/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12518116| archivedate= 21 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looting and major disorder were widespread in Tangier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hespress.com/?browser=view&amp;EgyxpID=28211 |title=تخريب مخفر شرطة ووكالة بنكية في طنجة |publisher=Hespress |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marrakesh,&lt;ref name="aufaitmaroc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aufaitmaroc.com/actualites/maroc/2011/2/20/20-fevrier-incidents-apres-des-manifestations-a-marrakech-et-a-larache |title="20 février": Incidents après des manifestations à Marrakech et à Larache |publisher=Aufait Maroc |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224010619/http://www.aufaitmaroc.com/actualites/maroc/2011/2/20/20-fevrier-incidents-apres-des-manifestations-a-marrakech-et-a-larache |archivedate=24 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hespress.com/?browser=view&amp;EgyxpID=28257 |title=بلطجية' مراكش يفسدون مسيرة 20 فبراير' |publisher=Hespress |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lakome.com/videos/77-featured/2614-2011-02-20-22-15-24.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222221615/http://www.lakome.com/videos/77-featured/2614-2011-02-20-22-15-24.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 February 2011 |title=أعمال تخريب بمراكش |publisher=Lakome.com |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Hoceima]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hespress.com/?browser=view&amp;EgyxpID=28276 |title=تخريب يطال الحسيمة بعد انتهاء مسيرة 20 فبراير |publisher=Hespress |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hespress.com/?browser=view&amp;EgyxpID=28275 |title=التخريب بمدينة الحسيمة |publisher=Hespress |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chefchaouen]],&lt;ref name="hespress2"/&gt; [[Larache]],&lt;ref name="aufaitmaroc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hespress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hespress.com/?browser=view&amp;EgyxpID=28272 |title=يد التخريب تمتد إلى العرائش والقصر الكبير |publisher=Hespress |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hespress.com/?browser=view&amp;EgyxpID=28271 |title=نهب وتخريب في العرائش |publisher=Hespress |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ksar-el-Kebir]],&lt;ref name="hespress1"/&gt; [[Fes|Fez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hespress.com/?browser=view&amp;EgyxpID=28274 |title=عنف بمدينة فاس |publisher=Hespress |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guelmim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hespress.com/?browser=view&amp;EgyxpID=28263 |title=اشتباكات بين الأمن ومتظاهرين في كلميم |publisher=Hespress |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tétouan]],&lt;ref name="hespress2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hespress.com/?browser=view&amp;EgyxpID=28416 |title=218 شخصا أمام العدالة بعد أحداث 20 فبراير |publisher=Hespress |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sefrou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hespress.com/?browser=view&amp;EgyxpID=28264 |title=هدوء حذر يسود مدينة صفرو |publisher=Hespress |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands took to the streets of Rabat, Casablanca, Tangier and Marrakech in peaceful protests demanding a new constitution, a change in government and an end to corruption. During a march on Hassan II Avenue in the capital, Rabat, demonstrators demanded a new constitution to bring more democracy to the country. They shouted slogans calling for economic opportunity, education reform, better health services, and help in coping with the rising cost of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/856068-protests-spread-to-streets-of-morocco |title=Protests spread to streets of Morocco |work=Metro NEws |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2011/02/20/moroccans-want-to-reign-in-royal-powers/ |title=Moroccans want to reign in royal powers |work=Euronews |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February, about 1,000 people demonstrated in [[Casablanca]] demanding political reforms, according to [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/at-reform-rally-in-morocco/story-fn6s850w-1226012647707|title=Casablanca catches protest fever |date=27 February 2011|accessdate=1 March 2011|work=Herald Sun|agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March, several hundred demonstrators gathered in Casablanca demanding reforms. Riot police broke up the rally with batons, injuring dozens in what was described as the most violent intervention since the start of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moroccan police break up rally, hurt dozens-witness  |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE72D00X20110314?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;sp=true |agency=Reuters Africa |date=14 March 2011|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May, Moroccan police spent hours chasing hundreds of pro-democracy activists through the streets of the capital in an effort to prevent any pro-reform demonstrations. The government appeared to be implementing a new zero-tolerance policy for protesters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/Article_2011-05-22-ML-Morocco-Demonstrations/id-paaa0869d0d074b9388450639c6688ea5 Associated Press 22 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July, a few dozen 20 February Movement protesters gathered in front of a courthouse in Safi to demand authorities to free two unfairly arrested Sebt Gzoula demonstrators. Those two{{who|date=November 2012}} were arrested under false claims of attacking government forces.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Protests have continued nearly every Sunday, with thousands marching in cities around Morocco calling for governmental reform.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

On 18 September, 3,000 protesters marched through the streets of Casablanca in the largest such demonstration in months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/18/ap/middleeast/main20107964.shtml |title=Morocco's democracy protests restart after hiatus |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919155145/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/18/ap/middleeast/main20107964.shtml |archivedate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Off-topic|date=March 2013}}
On 27 May, tens of thousands of Moroccans took to the streets of [[Casablanca]] protesting against the government’s alleged failure to tackle unemployment and other social woes, accusing Prime Minister [[Abdelilah Benkirane]] of failing to deliver promised reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Morocco protests fill Casablanca streets| date=27 May 2012 | publisher=BBC News| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18231125| accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July, hundreds of protesters led by 20 February Youth Movement marched in the working class area of [[Sidi Bernoussi]] in Casablanca and chanted against government policies, social marginalisation, and corruption. They also took aim at the wealthy clique of Moroccans known as the [[Makhzen]], the governing elite centred around monarch King [[Mohammed VI]]. They were later met with violence by police; suddenly at the very end, police started beating street vendors and passers-by and later started chasing and apprehending protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Molloy|first=Connor| title = Morocco protests turn violent| date=25 July 2012 | work=Daily News Egypt| url = http://thedailynewsegypt.com/2012/07/25/morocco-protests-turn-violent/| accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 August, nearly 1,000 people gathered in Casablanca chanting anti-corruption slogans, denouncing the sharp rise in prices, and calling for the release of jailed activists, with another 300 people gathered near the main boulevard in [[Rabat]] chanting slogans criticising Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane and King Mohammed VI, while waving anti-government banners. Activists blame the ruling [[Justice and Development Party (Morocco)|Justice and Development Party (PJD)]] for a surge in fuel prices &amp;mdash; petrol jumped by 20% in June 2012 when the government moved to cut its unaffordable subsidies bill &amp;mdash; that has driven up the cost of food and other basic goods. They also accuse the moderate [[Islamist]] party of not fulfilling its campaign pledges to address social grievances and fight corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Anti-government demos in Morocco's main cities| date=11 August 2012 | publisher=Agence France-Presse (via Google)| url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hMyJ5rFtqF4ToxuixWwMXTsJ806g?docId=CNG.0ecd32f22630d8846ffcba9428901618.91| accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dozens of activists gathered on 23 August outside Parliament to call for the abolition of the ceremony of the [[Bay'ah]], in which government officials bow down before King Mohammed VI in an elaborate ritual at the palace in Rabat, an annual event normally held on 30 July to commemorate the king's coronation 13 years ago. Opposition activists say the event perpetuates a "backwardness" and "servitude" in Morocco that is inappropriate for the 21st century, touching on a highly sensitive issue in the [[North African]] country. Most of those attending demonstration were members of the 20 February Youth Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martelli|first=Simon|title=Protest over Morocco king loyalty ritual highlights tensions| date=23 August 2012 | publisher=Agence France-Presse (via Google)|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iL-sPVYaDTFBuxsIX0ydVsUYG3gw?docId=CNG.70a031fd8f1cbe07c563f19c1c6f856f.1a1| accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 500 demonstrators marched in Rabat on 23 September to protest against corruption and political detentions. The marchers, mostly youths, chanted slogans urging the authorities to release from prison members of the 20 February Youth Movement. There were no reports of unrest and the march ended peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protests in Rabat against political detentions |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jA6jKrty4836LFDx7I3yYb_UAT-A?docId=CNG.ecf981e7cccc633c7b442e7e2570178e.831|accessdate=24 September 2012|publisher=Agence France-Presse (via Google) |date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic response==
On 9 March, in a live televised address, King Mohammed VI announced his decision to undertake a comprehensive constitutional reform aimed at improving democracy and the rule of law, and underlined his "firm commitment to giving a strong impetus to the dynamic and deep reforms... taking place". The monarch announced the formation of a commission to work on the constitutional revisions, with proposals to be made to him by June after which a [[Moroccan constitutional referendum, 2011|referendum]] would be held on the draft constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=

The commission was widely criticised by the protest movement leaders, which refused to participate in the commission's work, despite being invited to do so by the government.

On 14 April, King Mohammed VI pardoned or reduced the sentences of 190 prisoners, including Islamists and [[Sahrawi independence]] activists.&lt;ref name="24AprAFP"/&gt;

==Constitutional reform proposals==
In a televised speech on 17 June, [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|King Mohammed VI]] announced a series of constitutional reforms, passed through [[Moroccan constitutional referendum, 2011|a national referendum]] on 1 July.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/world/africa/18morocco.html?_r=1&amp;src=me&amp;ref=world Morocco King Proposes Limited Steps to Democracy], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 17 June 2011. Retrieved 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The newly proposed reforms were largely supported by Moroccans, and popular celebrations were observed throughout the country, although the leaders of the 20 February Movement rejected the proposals as insufficient and called for continuing protests on 19 June 2011 demanding "truly democratic constitution and a parliamentary monarchy", while calling for a mass boycott of the poll.&lt;ref name="aj"&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/06/201161810543184895.html Protests called against Morocco reform plan,] [[Al Jazeera]], 18 June 2011. Retrieved 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13827502 | publisher=BBC News | title=Moroccans demonstrate over king's proposed reforms | date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 June 2011, the protesters called for a boycott of the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;http://derstandard.at/1308680006152/Demokratiebewegung-ruft-zum-Boykott-auf&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed reforms passed and gave the prime minister and parliament more executive authority, and made [[Berber languages|Berber]] an official language in Morocco, together with [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as well as the [[Hassānīya language|Arab-Hassani Language]] spoken among the [[Saharawi]] tribes of Morocco. The proposal empowered the prime minister with the authority to appoint government officials and to dissolve the parliament - the powers previously held by the king.&lt;ref name="aj"/&gt; However, the king remains the military commander-in-chief and retains his position as the chair of the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Security Council, the primary bodies responsible for the security policy.&lt;ref name="aj"/&gt; A new constitutional provision  also confirms the king's role as the highest religious authority in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13816974 Morocco's King Mohammed unveils constitutional reforms], [[BBC News]],  18 June 2011. Retrieved 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In a televised speech on 30 July the king said the constitutional changes should be implemented swiftly, starting with [[Moroccan parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary elections]], adding that "any delay may jeopardise this dynamic of trust and squander opportunities offered by the new reform". After negotiations between the interior ministry, which oversees elections, and some 20 political parties, the government proposed that parliamentary elections should take place on 11 November instead of the scheduled date of September next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Morocco to host early parliamentary election|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/08/201181541738753674.html |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of protesters went onto the streets again on 11 September 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://derstandard.at/1315006080977/Tausende-demonstrieren-erneut-fuer-demokratische-Reformen&lt;/ref&gt; and on 18 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Morocco’s pro-democracy movements start demonstrations again after hiatus |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/moroccos-pro-democracy-movements-start-demonstrations-again-after-hiatus/2011/09/18/gIQArwB2cK_story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923023420/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/moroccos-pro-democracy-movements-start-demonstrations-again-after-hiatus/2011/09/18/gIQArwB2cK_story.html |archive-date=2011-09-23 |deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Media platforms==
One of the media platforms that advertised the movement was [[Mamfakinch]], a collaborative website that published content mainly in French and Arabic, but also English. "Mamfakinch" means "no concession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://moroccansforchange.com/2011/04/03/mamfakinch/ |work=Moroccans For Change |title=Mamfakinch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415045504/http://moroccansforchange.com/2011/04/03/mamfakinch/ |archivedate=15 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The website was started by young Moroccans who were excited by the 20 February demonstrations, which sought sweeping social, economic, and political reform in Morocco.  The designers claim diverse political persuasions but share a common belief in the democratic values of freedom and humans rights.  The site is not afraid to be critical of the Moroccan government and promotes the rights to free speech and access to information. Mamfakinch is a citizen media source endeavoring to provide accurate information that other, mainstream media sources misrepresent, intentionally distort, or completely ignore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://summit2012.globalvoicesonline.org/2012/07/announcing-the-winners-of-the-breaking-borders-awards/ | work= Global Voices | title= Announcing the Winners of the Breaking Borders Awards }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Mamfakinch received the [http://summit2012.globalvoicesonline.org/2012/07/announcing-the-winners-of-the-breaking-borders-awards/ Google/Global Voices Breaking Borders Award] for "defending and promoting freedom of speech rights on the internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mamfakinch.com/a-propos/ | work=Mamfakinch | title= About Us }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==
On 20 February 2011, five bodies had been found in [[Al Hoceima]], within a bank that had been destroyed by protesters who set it on fire during the 20 February protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12524647 |title=Morocco protests: Five burned bodies found - minister |accessdate=21 February 2011 |date=21 February 2011 |publisher=BBC News |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wfm0MiTu?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12524647 |archivedate=21 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to eyewitnesses, the bodies belonged to rioters that were trying to loot the bank.&lt;ref name="hespress3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hespress.com/?browser=view&amp;EgyxpID=28416 |title=ارتفاع حصيلة أحداث 20 فبراير إلى 6 قتلى |publisher=Hespress |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 2011, a man died of injuries he had allegedly received during the riots the city of Safi witnessed three days before. Official reports state that the man's participation to the protest in  precarious health conditions led to the complications which caused his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David E. |last=Miller|title=Demonstrator's death energizes Moroccan protesters|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=224033|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=The Media Line|date=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[GCC Champions League]]''' ({{lang-ar|دوري أبطال الخليج للأندية}}), is an annually organized football league tournament for club of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].

The 2016 edition was set to be the 31st edition.&lt;ref&gt;https://instagram.com/p/3jd8Riog4P/&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6th 2015 it was announced that the competition would be postponed until February 2016 due to the suspension of [[Kuwait]] from [[FIFA]]. Later in January 2016 it was announced that the competition would not take place at all due to a lack of sponsorship. The next edition would therefore be held in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kooora.com/?n=459598&amp;cz=8467&amp;o=n8467|title=اللجنة التنظيمية تقرر تأجيل كأس الأندية الخليجية 31|language=Arabic|publisher=Kooora|date=12 January 2016|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jdey moved to [[Canada]], using a false passport and seeking [[Right of asylum|asylum]],&lt;ref name="bosglob"&gt;Hickerson, Colin. [[Boston Globe]], "US wary of 'time bombs' waiting to strike from north", February 4, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leiken, Robert S. and Steven Brooke, [http://www.nixoncenter.org/reports/BrookeLeikenMatrix.xls Matrix of terror suspects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513194255/http://www.nixoncenter.org/reports/BrookeLeikenMatrix.xls |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Tunisia]] in 1991 and became a [[Canadian nationality law|Canadian citizen]] in 1995.

He rented a [[C$]]217 monthly apartment in [[Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie]] (a borough of Montreal),&lt;ref name="bosglob"/&gt; and studied [[biology]] at the [[Université de Montréal]].&lt;ref name="rfjhotsheet"/&gt; In 1999, he wrote a pair of letters to unknown [[Muslims]] overseas, explaining how he found religion and speaking with contempt of the United States and [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;Ha, Tu Thanh.

American authorities allege that he "may" have trained at [[Mes Aynak]] alongside hijackers [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]] and [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] in Afghanistan, before being assigned to a second wave of attacks. A letter written by [[Saif al-Adl]], and later found by American forces, suggested that Jdey may have originally been slated to have participated in the original [[9/11|September 11 attacks]]&lt;ref name="rfjhotsheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;[[9/11 Commission]], [http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf 9/11 Report: Notes to Chapter 7.], August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Jdey returned to [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada in early 2001. [[Khalid Sheikh Mohamed]], while being [[enhanced interrogation|harshly interrogated]], said that Jdey then backed out of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence report, interrogation of KSM, July 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 2010 Harvard report on al Qaeda by a former CIA officer, Jdey was detained in summer 2001 together with [[Zacarias Moussaoui]].  Moussaoui was carrying textbooks on cropdusting; Jdey was carrying textbooks on biology.  Jdey was evidently subsequently released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/al-qaeda-wmd-threat.pdf |title=Al Qaeda Weapons of Mass Destruction Threat: Hype or Reality? p. 16 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2001, he left Canada, several months after obtaining a replacement passport for one he'd received two years earlier which he claimed to have lost.&lt;ref name="again"&gt;[[CBC.ca|CBC]], [http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/ussecurity/fbi_wanted.html Wanted - again], May 27, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He was believed to be bound for Europe.&lt;ref name="bosglob"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rfjhotsheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/english/index.cfm?page=abderraouf |title=Rewards For Justice wanted poster on Jdey |publisher=Rewardsforjustice.net |date=1965-05-30 |accessdate=2013-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205062604/http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/english/index.cfm?page=abderraouf |archivedate=2012-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==November airline crash==
Less than three months after the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 587]] in [[Queens, New York]], rumors were already suggesting that it had been destroyed by an unknown terrorist with a [[shoe bomb]] similar to the one found on [[Richard Reid]].&lt;ref&gt;Irvine, Reed. Accuracy in Media, [http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/rumors-about-flight-587/ Rumors about Flight 587], February 6, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Four months later, [[Mohammed Mansour Jabarah]] agreed to cooperate with American authorities in exchange for a reduced sentence. A known colleague of [[Khalid Sheikh Mohamed]], he stated that Mohamed's lieutenant had told him that Reid and Jdey had both been enlisted by the al-Qaeda chief to carry out identical plots as part of a "second wave" of attacks against the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Mili, Hayder.

==United States 2002 claims==
[[File:Jdey Composite 2.jpg|thumb|A [[composite image]] created by the FBI to show how Jdey may try to disguise himself.]]
On January 14, 2002, a series of five videocassettes were recovered from the rubble of the destroyed home of [[Mohammad Atef]] outside of [[Kabul, Afghanistan]]. The tapes showed Jdey, [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], [[Muhammad Sa'id Ali Hasan]], [[Abdul Rahim Jenko|Abd Al-Rahim]], and [[Khalid Ibn Muhammad Al-Juhani]] vowing to die as martyrs.  It was the first time authorities had reason to suspect him of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;[[CBC.ca|CBC]], [http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2002/01/25/terror_cda020125.html Two Canadians among fugitive al-Qaeda members], January 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC News]] said the videos had been recorded after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Three days later, the FBI released to the public the first [[FBI Seeking Information – Terrorism list]] in order to profile the five wanted terrorists about whom very little was known, but who were suspected of plotting additional terrorist attacks in martyrdom operations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/seekinfo/seek.htm Most Wanted Terrorists Seeking Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060314213748/https://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/seekinfo/seek.htm |date=March 14, 2006 }}, January 17, 2002, (dead link)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/terseekinfomartyr.htm Martyrdom Messages/video, Seeking Information Alert] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805042335/https://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/terseekinfomartyr.htm |date=August 5, 2009 }} video clips published by the FBI January 17, 2002, and photos of the remaining 4 terrorists, FBI archival after September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Already under fire for issuing "excessive and somewhat alarmist" warnings about terrorists plotting against the United States, [[Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] stated that Jdey and [[Faker Boussora]] were likely traveling together and should be considered "extremely dangerous".&lt;ref&gt;Lichtblau, Eric. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jan/26/news/mn-24928 2 Canadians tied to terrorist plots], January 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after Jdey and Boussora were declared fugitives, the [[Republic of Turkey]] announced that the pair may be within their borders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fox News]], [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,45989,00.html Turks: Al Qaeda Men Planning Israel Attack], February 20, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]] was interrogated at an American [[black site]] in 2003 about his knowledge of Jdey, and confessed that Jdey had recruited by [[al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence report, interrogation of bin al-Shibh, Sept. 11 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The following year [[Walid bin 'Attash]], similarly interrogated under harsh circumstances at [[The Dark Prison]], confirmed that Jdey had been known to him.&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence report, interrogation of Khallad (Walid bin 'Attash), May 21, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States 2003 claims==
In September 2003, the FBI issued an alert for four people they alleged "pose a threat to U.S. citizens", including Jdey, [[Adnan G. El Shukrijumah]] and the previously unknown [[Zubayr al-Rimi]] and [[Karim el-Mejjati]].&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[[CNN]], [http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/09/05/fbi.bolo/ FBI seeks 4 suspected of terrorist activities], September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States 2004 claims==
On May 26, 2004, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] and [[FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]] announced that reports indicated that Jdey was one of seven al-Qaeda members who were planning terrorist actions for the summer or fall of 2004. The other six named were Shukrijumah, [[Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani]], [[Fazul Abdullah Mohammed]], [[Amer El-Maati]], [[Aafia Siddiqui]] and [[Adam Yahiye Gadahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/05/26/terror.threat.transcript/ Transcript: Ashcroft, Mueller news conference], CNN.com, Wednesday, May 26, 2004 Posted: 8:19 PM EDT (0019 GMT)&lt;/ref&gt;  American [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]s labeled the warning "suspicious" and said it was held solely to divert attention from President Bush's plummeting poll numbers and to push the failings of the [[Invasion of Iraq]] off the front page.&lt;ref name="kerry"&gt;Pither, Kerry. "Dark Days: The Story of Four Canadians Tortured in the Name of Fighting Terror", 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; CSIS director [[Reid Morden]] voiced similar concerns, saying it seemed more like "election year" politics, than an actual threat, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed out that one day before the announcement, they had been told by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] that there were no current risks.&lt;ref name="kerry"/&gt;

The day after the announcement, there was a reported sighting of Jdey and Shukrijumah at a [[Denny's|Denny's restaurant]] in [[Colorado]].{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;ref name="online"&gt;Kupferberg, Chaim.

In April 2005, the [[U.S. State Department]] [[Bureau of Diplomatic Security|Rewards for Justice Program]] offered a reward of up to US$5 million for information leading to the capture of Jdey, even though he has not been indicted.&lt;ref name="fbihotsheet"&gt;[[FBI]], [https://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/jdey.htm Rewards for Justice: Jdey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183944/https://www2.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/jdey.htm |date=2016-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atlantis 35th Anniversary Show''', or more properly '''Funcion Homenaje a Atlantis por 35 Años de carrera luchistica''' (Spanish for "Tribute to Atlantis for his 35 year career in wrestling") was a [[professional wrestling]] [[Card (sports)#Supercard|super card]] held on July 13, 2018. The show was produced and scripted by the Mexican [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL: Spanish for "World Wrestling Council") and took place at [[Arena México]] in Mexico City, Mexico. The special edition of CMLL's [[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]] show honored CMLL wrestler [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] for reaching his 35th anniversary as a professional wrestler.

While the event honored Atlantis he did not work the main event match, instead he teamed up with old partners [[Octagón]] and [[Rayo de Jalisco Jr.]] to defeat the team of [[Fuerza Guerrera]], [[Máscara Año 2000]] and [[Último Guerrero]]. The main event saw [[Los Ingobernables]] ([[Rush (wrestler)|Rush]] and [[El Terrible]]) defeat the Sky Team ([[Valiente (wrestler)|Valiente]] and [[Volador Jr.]]) to with the [[CMLL World Tag Team Championship]]. The show featured four additional matches.

==Production==
===Background===
Professional wrestler [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] made his in ring debut in the summer of 1983.&lt;ref name=FigurasAtlantis&gt;{{cite news|title=Lucha Libre: Conoce la historia de las leyendas de cuadrilátero|work=Atlantis (1962)|location=[[Mexico]]|id=Grandes Figuras de la Lucha Libre|page=8|year=2008|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years the young, highly skilled wrestler rose through the ranks of CMLL, winning his first major ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or "bet match", just over a year after his debut as he defeated [[Arturo Beristain|Talismán]] in the main event of the [[EMLL 51st Anniversary Show]].&lt;ref name=79Anniversaries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Superluchas.com/2010/09/07/cmll-77-historias-77-aniversario-las-77-luchas-estelares/|title=CMLL: 79 historias, 79 Aniversario, las 79 luchas estelares|first=Alex|last=Ruiz Glez|date=September 7, 2010|accessdate=October 20, 2012|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later main event the [[EMLL 56th Anniversary Show]], teaming up with [[El Satánico]] to win the masks of Tierra Viento y Fuego and [[MS-1 (wrestler)|MS-1]].&lt;ref name=79Anniversaries/&gt; He won his third anniversary show main event in 1991 when he defeated and unmasked [[Mano Negra (wrestler)|Mano Negra]] at [[CMLL 60th Anniversary Show]].&lt;ref name=FigurasAtlantis/&gt; In 2000 he deafted and unmasked [[Villano III]] in the main event of ''[[Juicio Final (2000)|Juicio Final]]'', in a match that was voted the [[Wrestling Observer]] match of the year.&lt;ref name=DiaMarch16&gt;{{cite web | url=https://superluchas.com/2015/03/17/en-un-dia-como-hoy-2000-atlantis-vence-a-villano-iii-en-duelo-de-mascaras-ultimo-guerrero-estrella-del-futuro/ | title=En un día como hoy… 2000: Atlantis vence a Villano III en duelo de máscaras… Último Guerrero, estrella del futuro | first=Teddy | last=Centinela | date=March 17, 2015 | accessdate=July 1, 2015 | work=SuperLuchas Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; His list of high profile mask victories later included long-time rival [[Último Guerrero]] at [[CMLL 81st Anniversary Show]] and [[Andrade Cien Almas|La Sombra]] at [[CMLL 82nd Anniversary Show]].&lt;ref name=SL81&gt;{{cite web | url=http://Superluchas.com/2014/09/19/cmll-81-aniversario-cobertura-y-resultados-atlantis-vs-ultimo-guerrero-mascara-vs-mascara/ | title=CMLL 81 aniversario (Cobertura y resultados en vivo) -Atlantis destapa a Último Guerrero | first=Eduardo | last=Cano Vela | date=September 19, 2014 | accessdate=September 20, 2014 | work=SuperLuchas | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SLVivo&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.com/2015/09/18/cmll-82-aniversario-cobertura-en-vivo-atlantis-vs-sombra-mascara-contra-mascara-el-adios-de-dark-angel/ | title=CMLL: 82 Aniversario — Cobertura en vivo — Atlantis vs. Sombra máscara contra máscara — El adiós de Dark Angel | date=September 18, 2015 | accessdate=September 18, 2015 | first=Ernesto | last=Ocampo | work=Superluchas | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
The event featured six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

==Event==
The fifth match of the night honored Atlantis as he teamed up with his old partners [[Octagón]] and [[Rayo de Jalisco Jr.]], neither of whom worked for CMLL on a regular basis at that point in time. To honor his partner Octagón wore an outfit where his traditional red color was replaced with the blue color associated with Atlantis. The trio faced off against [[Fuerza Guerrera]], [[Máscara Año 2000]] and [[Último Guerrero]]. For the night both Máscara Año 2000 and Último Guerrero wore their old wrestling masks that they had both lost years ago. After his team won Atlantis introduced his sons, Atlantis Jr. and El Hijo de Atlantis, to the CMLL crowd.&lt;ref name=CMLLTag39/&gt;&lt;ref name=EstoAtlantis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Atlantis35/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The ongoing rivalry between [[Los Ingobernables]] and the Ibarra family ([[Volador Jr.]], [[L.A. Park]], [[El Hijo de L.A. Park]] and [[Flyer (wrestler)|Flyer]]) continued past the championship change, focusing more on Rush and Volador Jr. than previously. After the [[Negro Casas 40th Anniversary Show]], [[Matt Taven]] and [[Bárbaro Cavernario]] were added to the mix,&lt;ref name=Casas40Ovaciones&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ovaciones.com/aceptan-el-reto/ | title=¡Aceptan el reto! | first=Arturo | last=Rosas Plata | language=Spanish | date=August 4, 2018 | accessdate=September 21, 2018 | work=Ovaciones}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter stepping in to take [[El Terrible]]'s place when he was injured. That feud that became the main event of CMLL's biggest show of 2018, the [[CMLL 85th Anniversary Show]]. Rush and Bárbaro Cavernario won the tag team ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet match, when Taven attacked Volador Jr., forcing both Volador Jr. and Taven to be shaved bald as a result.&lt;ref name=WON&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.f4wonline.com/mexico/cmll-85th-aniversario-live-results-hair-vs-hair-tag-team-main-event-265781 | title=CMLL 85.

The '''Bonville–Courtenay feud''' of 1455 engendered a series of raids, sieges, and attacks between two major [[Devon]] families, the [[House of Courtenay#The English House of Courtenay|Courtenays]] and the [[Baron Bonville|Bonvilles]], in [[south west England]], in the mid-fifteenth century. One of many such aristocratic feuds of the time, it became entwined with national politics due to the political weight of the protagonists. The Courtenay [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]] were the traditional powerbrokers in the region, but by this time a local baronial family, the Bonvilles, had become more powerful and rivalled the Courtenays for royal patronage. Eventually this rivalry spilled over into physical violence, including social disorder, murder and siege.

The Bonville-Courtenay feud is often given as an example of the degree to which law and order and respect for the king had broken down in the provinces. As a result, modern historians have often considered it a cause of the later [[Wars of the Roses]]; and indeed, the course of the feud often closely followed the sectarian politics of the day. The feud is perhaps most well known for culminating in an armed encounter at [[Clyst Heath|Clyst]] (called the fight, or sometimes the battle, of Clyst), near [[Exeter]], which resulted in loss of life.

The events at Clyst  resulted in government intervention in the politics of the west country. This was unusual, as the government did not have a good track-record of settling local disputes among the nobility. However, it is likely that this was done for reasons of higher politics; [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville|William Bonville]] was by 1455 a Yorkist, and [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] had been made [[Lord Protector]]. Although in the short term it resulted in [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon|Thomas de Courtenay, Earl of Devon]]'s incarceration, the Bonville–Courtenay feud did not come to an effective end until the protagonists were all killed in the early years of the civil wars.

The mid-fifteenth century suffered greatly from the private [[feud]]s of the [[nobility]], and the [[Wars of the Roses]] in general. Devonshire, whilst experiencing none of the pitched battles, was still ravaged by a private feud.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 252&lt;/ref&gt; This was between [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]], whose family had been [[Earl of Devon|earls of that county]] since 1335&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne, G.E. &amp; Gibbs, V.,(ed.), ''The Complete Peerage of Great Britain and Ireland'', 16 vols, rev. (London, 1916), 323&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]]. Their feud became inextricably tied to the national political scene, but originated in regional Devon society. In 2003, [[historian]] Martin Cherry agreed that the south west was to a great degree lawless at this time. However, he suggested that the Bonville-Courtenay feud, whilst being the best-known, is not the sole example of political upheaval in the region, which was common throughout the century.&lt;ref&gt;Kleineke, H., 'Why the West was Wild: Law and Disorder in Fifteenth-Century Cornwall and Devon', in: Clark, L.S., (ed.), ''The Fifteenth Century III: Authority and Subversion'' (Woodbridge, 2003), 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, historian [[R. L. Storey]] suggested that the [[civil war]]s which racked England for much of the fifteenth century had their origins in the breakdown of both the king's ability to govern, and law and order in the localities, and gave the Courtenay-Bonville feud as one such example.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 165–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], had been incapacitated by mental illness in August 1453.&lt;ref name="Wagner2001"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubXnWRMt6uoC&amp;pg=PA113|title=Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2001|isbn=978-1-85109-358-8|pages=113–|author=John A.

York and his closest allies, his brother-in-law [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury]] and Salisbury's son [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]], anticipated that charges might be brought against them at this assembly. They gathered an armed retinue and marched to stop the royal party from reaching Leicester, intercepting them at [[St Albans]]. Both militarily and politically it was a complete victory for York and the Nevilles. On 22 May 1455, at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] they captured the king and retook their places in government, while York's and the Nevilles' rivals, the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford|Lord Clifford]] were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, A., ''The Wars of the Roses: Military Activity and English Society, 1452–97'', (London, 1981), 24&lt;/ref&gt; Among the royalists wounded were the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] and Somerset's son the [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Earl of Dorset]], the [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], and the king's half-brother [[Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford|Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke]].&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale, 2010), 110.&lt;/ref&gt; York was appointed Protector of England, for the second time, by parliament a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale, 2010), 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Ralph A. Griffiths]] places the fault for the feud between the Courtenays and Bonvilles firmly in the lap of King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], through whose "thoughtless liberality and government carelessness&amp;nbsp;... personal jealousies in the [[west country]] had been exacerbated."&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 577&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recently, Martin Cherry warned against seeing the feud as the same as the later civil wars writ small; they were, he says, "qualitatively" different, resulting in the ultimate disintegration of the earl's affinity, rather than symptomatic of his violence.&lt;ref&gt;Kleineke, H., 'Why the West was Wild: Law and Disorder in Fifteenth-Century Cornwall and Devon', in: Clark, L.S., (ed.), ''The Fifteenth Century III: Authority and Subversion'' (Woodbridge, 2003), 77&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]] has pointed out that although there were many other regional feuds at this time (including the [[John Talbot, 1st Viscount Lisle#Aggressive acquisition|Lisle]]-[[Berkeley family|Berkeley]] dispute, also waged in the west country), they did not have the same causes, or were necessarily caused by weak government at all: for instance, whereas the Bonville–Courtenay feud had territorial domination at its root, others, such as the Berkeley–Lisle dispute, were begun over contested [[inheritance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'' (Totton, 2012), 96&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry has also suggested that the main cause of the Bonville–Courtenay dispute was the desperation of the earl to "gain access to crown patronage for himself and his clients" – something he was gradually failing to do in the face of competition.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 123–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local politics===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Sir William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville, KG.png|thumb|Coat of Arms of Sir William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]]
As noted, the feud between the Bonvilles and Courtenays was rooted in local Devonshire politics. The rivalry between them stemmed from the fact that they were major [[estate (land)|estate]] holders in the south west, and further, because both had claims to crown patronage. For example, William Bonville had fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] for both Henry VI and his father, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], whilst Devon through his wife was the king's cousin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1912"&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 253&lt;/ref&gt; Although the earl was both the greatest landowner and the highest ranking nobleman in the county, he had in recent years seen members of the lesser gentry and nobility (such as William Bonville) receive advancement in his stead.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 574&lt;/ref&gt; Bonville had also furthered his own advancement by successively marrying into the lower nobility (a daughter of the [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Lord Grey of Ruthin]]) and then to an aunt of the Earl of Devon himself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"/&gt; The main royal office in the area –  and therefore the main source of royal patronage –  was the stewardship of the highly profitable [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. Both men had held the office alternately over recent years. Tensions between the two have been traced back to 1437, when the stewardship was taken from Courtenay and granted to William Bonville. Courtenay did receive a royal grant of £100 ''per annum'' [[life annuity]] at this time. But, says Griffiths, this is unlikely to have made up for loss of the main royal office in the county.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 574–5&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, within two years, severe attacks were being launched on Bonville's property, and by 1440, relations between the two were, Griffiths says, "at breaking point." This tension became apparent in open manifestations of military strength; manifestations worrying enough to government to lead to them both being summoned before council.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 575&lt;/ref&gt; In 1441 the stewardship was returned to the Earl of Devon, although Radford questions whether Bonville actually ever physically surrendered the office, as in November that year an [[arbitration]] took place between them to "end all [of their] differences."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1912"/&gt;

There followed a four-year period of peace; but this could simply be accounted for by the fact that Bonville spent that time in service in [[Gascony]], which, it has been suggested, may have been one of the conditions of the arbitration.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; It was, though, only a temporary peace for the region as by 1449 the earl besieged Bonville (now promoted to the [[baronage]] in recognition of his success in France)&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 576&lt;/ref&gt; in his castle of [[Taunton Castle|Taunton]] for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 254&lt;/ref&gt; Courtenay supported [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] in his 1452 rebellion at [[Dartford]], even joining him in the field against the king. This [[treason]] resulted in him forfeiting his royal offices in the south west, including not only the stewardship of the duchy – which was finally granted to Bonville for life – but [[Lydford Castle]], the [[Forest of Dartmoor]], and the [[River Exe|Water of Exe]].&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 255&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, as his ally the duke was eclipsed in government, Courtenay was eclipsed by Bonville in the south west. Courtenay had –  in imitation of his ally –  waged a local war against Bonville and Bonville's ally, the [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Earl of Wiltshire]], between 1451–5. Raising an army of 5–6,000 men, he forced Wiltshire to desert his manor of Lackham, and then returned to the siege of Taunton. The siege was only lifted when the Duke of York arrived unannounced three days later, and took the castle into his own hands, forcing a peace upon the two parties.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

Bonville had, then, by April 1455, received much royal favour, including all the offices the earl had lost, as well as the constableship of [[Rougemont Castle|Exeter Castle]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 165&lt;/ref&gt; He was –  as one historian has called him –  "the King's lieutenant in the west." The Earl of Devon had already reacted against this hegemony during the Duke of York's first protectorate (1454–5) and joined the [[Curia regis|royal council]]. However, it appears that even the council itself did not trust him to keep the [[Queen's peace|King's peace]], as they placed him under a bond of £1,000 to do so. This he had disregarded,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"/&gt; and commenced another campaign against Bonville. This time, the Earl of Devon was accompanied by his sons, and, bringing a force of men into [[Exeter]] in April 1455, he attempted to ambush Bonville. This resulted in further government-imposed undertakings of good behaviour between the two parties. As the government was now headed by Courtenay's old ally, the Duke of York, it is likely that it was now that the earl decided to reject his alliance with York and give his support to the crown. He fought (and was wounded) at [[First Battle of St Albans|St Albans]] on 22 May that year, on the side of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Roskell, J.S., ''The Commons in the Parliament of 1422'' (Manchester, 1954), 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Bonville, meanwhile, through his wife, was related to the Harrington family of [[Hornby-with-Farleton|Hornby]], [[Lancashire]], who had close links to the [[House of Neville|Nevilles]] –  his father-in-law was [[Thomas Harrington (knight)|Thomas Harrington]], a [[feoffee]] and [[Bastard feudalism|retainer]] to the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]]. Bonville's new-found [[House of York|Yorkist]] sympathies seem to have driven the Earl of Devon to even greater violence in the county.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==The murder of Nicholas Radford==
[[File:Tower, Exeter castle (geograph 3468003).jpg|thumb|left|Tower at Exeter castle]]
From October 1455, Devon and his sons were committing acts of social disorder, seemingly intending to disrupt the administrative machinery of the county (of which Bonville, of course, was a part), for instance by preventing the local [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] from holding quarterly sessions by force; they then proceeded to raise a small army at [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]] under the leadership of Devon's eldest son, [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay]]. It was this force that was to be guilty of what [[R. L. Storey]] has called "the most notorious private crime of the century," due not only to the violence involved but the fact that it was "so obviously premeditated."&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 167&lt;/ref&gt; This force made its way to [[Upcott, Cheriton Fitzpaine|Upcott]] on 23 October 1455, the home of [[Nicholas Radford]], a close associate and legal advisor to Bonville, and a respected member of the community who had previously been [[Recorder (judge)|recorder]] of the city of Exeter and [[member of parliament]]. Storey has suggested that being an experienced lawyer, he was most probably targeted by Devon and his sons for the very reason that he had aided Bonville's escape from Devon's litigation in the past;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 168&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 1455 he had [[enfeoffed]] Bonville (and others) for land valued at £400.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Courtenay's force attacked Radford's manor that night; they set fire to the wall and gates to draw him out. On their word, including Courtenay's solemn promise to do him no harm if he would speak with them, Radford let them in – although apparently he commented upon their large number. Whilst Radford and Devon's son drank wine, the latter's followers "ransacked"&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Radford's house, stealing goods up to the value of 1,000 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], including all his horses and the sheets off his [[Patient|invalid]] wife's bed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 169&lt;/ref&gt; On a pretext of meeting his father the earl, Courtenay persuaded Radford to accompany him when his force withdrew; however, he abandoned Radford on the road a short distance from the house, and six of Courtenay's men killed him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; Devon subsequently dispatched a force to the [[chapel]] where Radford's body was; they performed, says Storey, a "mock inquest, one of them acting as coroner and others, with assumed names, as jurors. They brought in a verdict of [[suicide]]."&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; They then forced Radford's servants to convey his corpse as if he had been a [[Heresy|heretic]] to the graveyard, where it was deposited unceremoniously into an open grave; the stones laid ready to build his memorial were then dropped on the body, crushing it. By making recognition of the body impossible, this prevented an official [[inquest]] being held into Radford's death.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;

==Following the murder==
The murder of Nicholas Radford, says R. L. Storey, was only "the curtain raiser" for further military activities. Devon proceeded to raise a force and occupy Exeter – "as if they were the city's lawful garrison" – until just before Christmas, seizing the [[Freedom of the City|keys of the city]];&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 257&lt;/ref&gt; various houses in the city belonging to Bonville and his supporters were ransacked, and members of the [[Exeter Cathedral|Cathedral]] were arrested and forced to buy their freedom. In one case, a man was bodily removed from the choir whilst celebrating [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]]. Both Bonville and Courtenay had 'extensive relations' with the Cathedral, dating back to the 1430s, but the Courtenays had greatly contributed to its expansion in the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;Attreed, L., 'Arbitration and the Growth of Urban Liberties in Late Medieval England', Journal of British Studies, 31 (1992), 227–8&lt;/ref&gt; Their actions in 1455 were probably inspired by the fact that Radford had entrusted much of his wealth to the safe-keeping of the church, and Devon saw an opportunity to enrich himself; possibly, says Storey, he was forced to take such action to be able to pay his men.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 170&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Cherry has pointed to the lack of references to any martial expenses on the earl's behalf in the extant accounts, as indicating that his campaign effectively paid for itself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; During the same period, Devon, "in warlike fashion and like an insurrection"&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; also besieged [[Powderham Castle]], which belonged to his distant cousin and Bonville ally, Sir [[Philip Courtenay (died 1463)|Philip Courtenay]]; the latter resisted, and Bonville came to his assistance. Prior to doing this, however, he raided the Earl of Devon's house at [[Colcombe Castle]] and proceeded to ransack it. Bonville attempted to lift the siege at Powderham on 19 November, but was repulsed by Devon, and lost two men in the fight,&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 171&lt;/ref&gt; which may have involved up to a thousand men.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 258&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Devon continued his attempts to persuade the city of Exeter to raise a force on his behalf – which they refused to do – before leaving Exeter on 15 December,&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt; as Bonville approached, on his way to Powderham. The two forces met at Clyst, just south west of Exeter.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fight at Clyst==
[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]
Devon marched from Exeter to encounter Bonville at [[Clyst Heath]]; there are very few extant sources for the event, and only one chronicler provides any details, saying he "departed out of the city with his people into the field of Clyst, and there bickered and fought with the Lord Bonville and put them to flight, and so returned again that night into the city."&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 171–2&lt;/ref&gt; Many bones were discovered when the site was excavated in 1800, although some, Storey points out, must belong to those killed in the [[Prayer Book Rebellion#Clyst Heath massaacre | 1549 engagement on the same site]]. Although difficult to assess the extent to which the engagement can be described as a battle (one chronicler estimated the dead at twelve men)&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Crown &amp; Political Society in Devon' (PhD thesis, University of Wales (Swansea), 1981), 307&lt;/ref&gt; it does appear to have been decisive in Devon's favour. The earl returned to Exeter, where the [[Mayor of Exeter|mayor]] had "tactfully" laid on a celebration.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt; Hannes Kleineke has described the mayor's decision to illuminate the city walls on the earl's return as "pragmatic",&lt;ref&gt;Kleineke, H., '"þe Kynges Cite"– Exeter in the Wars of the Roses', in Clarke, L. (ed.), ''Conflicts, Consequences and the Crown in the Later Middle Ages: The Fifteenth Century VII''  (Woodbridge, 2007), 156&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Cherry explains the mayor's behaviour as being due to the fact that the earl, "in his peculiar manner, [had behaved] punctiliously" to the mayor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt; The earl subsequently sent a [[sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]] led by [[Thomas Carrew]]&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 172&lt;/ref&gt; to attack Bonville's [[manor]] at [[Old Shute House#Bonville|Shute]] where they faced no resistance and pillaged freely, stealing Bonville's cattle, furnishings, and food.&lt;ref&gt;Orme, N., 'Representation and Rebellion in the Later Middle Ages', in Kain, R. &amp; W. Ravenhill (eds.), ''Historical Atlas of South-West England'' (Exeter, 1999), 141, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The weeks preceding the battle had been accompanied by what has been called "exchange[s] of formal declarations of war disguised in the chivalric mode of challenges to a duel."&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt; Michael Hicks has suggested that, in spite of the earl's clear superiority in numbers, it was Bonville who "goaded the earl into a fair fight," and that "in the spirit of chivalry" the confrontation at Clyst was his fault.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., The Wars of the Roses, (Yale, 2010), 116&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry too has suggested that Bonville and Courtenay of Powderham deliberately attempted to recruit members of the earl's historical tenantry, further poisoning relations,&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M. 'The Courtenay Earls of Devon: The Formation and Disintegration of a Late Medieval Aristocratic Affinity', ''Southern History'', 1 (1979), 95&lt;/ref&gt; and also that, although doubtless the earl has deserved the 'universally bad press' he has received from modern historians, he was still "reluctant to go to war," and that he did so "only after all other methods of achieving his aims&amp;nbsp;... had failed."&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Glourcester, 1981), 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from government==
[[File:PowderhamCastle FromUnderGatehouse.jpg|thumb|200px|Powderham Castle, west front, viewed from under the Victorian gatehouse. The leftmost tower dates from 1390–1450 as does the main high central block, which originally housed a full-height [[great hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Powderham Castle guide book, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
However decisive the Earl of Devon's victory had been, it had also drawn the attention of the government. This was still under the control of Bonville's allies, York, Salisbury, and Warwick, but had up until that point the Yorkists had failed to intervene in this local feud. The feud has been described as an example of local activities influencing parliament itself,&lt;ref&gt;Lander, J.R., 'Henry Vl and the Duke of York's Second Protectorate, 1455-6', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library'', 3 (1960), 59&lt;/ref&gt; and Griffiths said it was used as "a pretext for demanding York's appointment as protector."&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 755&lt;/ref&gt; When parliament reassembled on 12 November it was presented with reports that Devon was leading an army of about 4,000 men and including 400 cavalry to London. The king was still incapacitated. Unable to manage the situation; the Duke of York used the immediate necessity for intervention as a mechanism for being formally appointed Protector. He did not immediately hasten to the south west to punish the Earl of Devon, though. The earl was merely dismissed from his role on the [[Justice of the peace|commission of the peace]] in early December.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 172–3&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the local gentry were ordered to be ready to assist York. The duke did not set out until news was received of the Clyst confrontation. One chronicler states that following his defeat, Bonville "fled, and came to Grenewiche to the kyng, and the kyng sent him agayne to the lord protectour;"&lt;ref&gt;Lander, J.R., 'Henry Vl and the Duke of York's Second Protectorate, 1455-6', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library'', 3 (1960), 64&lt;/ref&gt; although it is also possible that he was committed to the [[Fleet Prison]] for a short time.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Crown &amp; Political Society in Devon' (Ph.D thesis, University of Wales (Swansea) 1981), 303&lt;/ref&gt; When finally York left for the south west, he summoned the Earl of Devon to [[Shaftesbury]] where the earl was arrested and sent to the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Earl of Devon remained imprisoned for only a few months. It is possible that an attempt was made to bring him to trial in February, but if so, it was probably – in Storey's words – "countermanded." This could have been, he suggests, indicative of York's "waning" position, as the protectorate was soon to come to an end:&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt; Cherry has said that the king's resumption of personal power in February 1456 must have come as "a considerable relief" to the earl.&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 138&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have taken the Yorkists' eclipse as a further opportunity to continue the feud, which provoked governmental admonishment in March, when his son [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|John Courtenay]], with 500 armed men, again prevented the Exeter justices of the peace from sitting, and evicted them. [[Letters patent|Commissions]] of ''[[oyer and terminer]]'' were issued in August, being led by Bonville's ally the [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Earl of Wiltshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 173–4&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bonville presented a long list of offences committed by Devon to the council (whilst mitigating his own involvement), the crown "was obviously unimpressed" by this, and eventually not only restored Devon to commission of the peace (12 September 1456) but also pardoned him and his sons for any involvement in the murder of Radford, eventually even appointing him to the lucrative office of keeper of the forest and park of [[Clarendon Park, Wiltshire|Clarendon]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt; The region subsequently remained quiet; Bonville was of advanced age and Devon was possibly unwell, as he died in [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] within eighteen months.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 174&lt;/ref&gt; His will was executed by some of the most important men on the Queen's council.&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt;

The region took no active part in the ensuing civil wars until the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471, but both parties to the feud were killed in the civil wars over the next few years. The new [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], who had killed Radford, was a thorough supporter of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] regime. After the [[House of York|Yorkist]] victory at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] in June 1460, he took his troops northwards to [[Margaret of Anjou]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt; in [[York]], where, in April 1461, he was executed by the new king, [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] after the [[Battle of Towton]]. Bonville's son and grandson had been killed with the [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Duke of York]] and the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]] at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, and Bonville himself, captured after the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] was summarily beheaded&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 174–5&lt;/ref&gt; – probably, so the chroniclers tell us, after a mock trial directly instigated by the Earl of Devon.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 138–9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central City Opera''' is the fifth-oldest opera company in the [[United States]], founded in 1932 by Julie Penrose and Anne Evans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpomar.org/who-we-are/our-history/julie-penrose History of Julie Penrose on elpomar.org] Retrieved 12 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Each festival is presented in the 550-seat historic [[Central City Opera House]] built in 1878 in the gold mining era town of [[Central City, Colorado]]. Pelham G. Pearce was selected in 1996 as Managing Director for Central City Opera, and he was named General/Artistic Director in May 1998, when John Moriarty became Artistic Director Emeritus.

Most recent six-week summer festivals have included traditional and progressive works.  About forty performances, including those specifically for young people, are presented each season.  2007 marked the 75th anniversary of the company and a single-season move from 3 to 4 opera productions.  "Short Works" (selected ten-minute opera scenes), selected one-acts, and "Lunch &amp; a Song" (solo luncheon performances), are produced alongside the main opera season by assistant directors and apprentice singers as part of the [[May Bonfils Stanton|Bonfils-Stanton Foundation]] Artists Training Program.

==Commissions==
Successful commissions for the company include the American classic ''[[The Ballad of Baby Doe]]'' by [[Douglas Moore]], premiered in 1956, the popular one-act opera ''[[The Face on the Barroom Floor (opera)|The Face on the Barroom Floor]]'' by [[Henry Mollicone]], premiered in 1978 and the 2003 world premiere of ''[[Gabriel's Daughter]]'', also composed by Henry Mollicone. The World Premiere of Chinese opera, ''[[Poet Li Bai]]'', commissioned by the Asian Performing Arts of Colorado, was presented in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artists/2007-07/20/content_101432.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305083848/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artists/2007-07/20/content_101432.htm |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }} Retrieved 30 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist training==
Central City Opera's prestigious [[Bonfils-Stanton Foundation]] Artists Training Program, founded by Artistic Director Emeritus [[John Moriarty (Conductor)|John Moriarty]], has served for more than two decades as a national model for training young singers.  The rigorous 10-week program integrates daily training in diction, movement, and [[stage combat]] with individual coaching, sessions in career management and rehearsals and performance opportunities in the summer's mainstage and auxiliary productions.  The program selects 30-32 participants from nearly 1,000 applicants each year.

==Opera traditions==
Noteworthy Opera traditions include the annual Yellow Rose Ball, Colorado's oldest debutante ceremony, on opening day.

The [[Ushers Song]] (sung by the Usher Corps as they march up the street to open the theatre for each mainstage performance).  The Usher Corps, composed of collegiate and young professional interns from all production and administrative departments, includes the traditional Bell Ringer to announce the time.

:Lyrics for The Ushers' Song:
:Well, what do you know, here we go / we're off to start the show.
:You'll know who we are from afar; /frankly we sing better than the star.

:We're the ushers, who show to your seat / then nonchalantly, we step upon your feet.
:You may have bought a ticket / for Row A and seat 3.
:But when we're through with you / you'll find you're in the balcony.

:We're the ushers who heed your beck and call / yet when you need us, we're never there at all.
:Our flashlights never working to show the pitfalls lurking / We're the ushers of the Central City show!

The '''Coal Glen mine disaster''' was a coal mine explosion that occurred on May 27, 1925, in [[Farmville, Chatham County, North Carolina|Coal Glen]], Oakland Township, [[Chatham County, North Carolina|Chatham County]], [[North Carolina]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~pfwilson/coal_glen.html|title=Coal Glen Mine Disaster|website=freepages.history.rootsweb.com|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located just north of the city of [[Sanford, North Carolina]]. Fifty-three miners died in the explosion. Attempts at re-opening the mine were made  sporadically until the 1950s, but were never financially viable.  The mine was permanently closed in 1951.

A historical marker was dedicated June 3, 2017 at Farmville Community Church at [[U.S. Route 15/501 in North Carolina|U.S. 15-501]] and Walter Bright Road.

==The incident==

The incident happened in the early hours of February 18, 2012 at the car park behind the [[Crowne Plaza Hotel]] on [[Sheikh Zayed Road]], Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mwakilishi.com/content/articles/2012/03/20/esther-mwikamba-the-kenyan-woman-brutally-beaten-in-dubai-last-month-has |title=Esther Mwikamba, the Kenyan Woman Brutally Beaten in Dubai Last Month Has Died |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323101602/http://mwakilishi.com/content/articles/2012/03/20/esther-mwikamba-the-kenyan-woman-brutally-beaten-in-dubai-last-month-has |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esther with two other women were walking to a waiting taxi during dark early morning when a group of young men in their early twenties approached them uninvited. Eyewitnesses alleged that unwarranted advances by one male led to the violence. They claimed that he groped one of the women on her buttocks. One of the women, Susan Wanjiru, said she immediately protested in very clear terms and told the offending man to leave her friend alone. The unidentified man answered with a punch to Susan's face, she claimed. When Susan was knocked from her feet, Esther attempted to defend her friend, throwing one of her shoes in the direction of the assailant. 

According to Susan, the group of men quickly gathered up their male friend and placed him in a four-wheel-drive vehicle to defuse the scene and apologized saying that he was drunk. But the man left the vehicle, then allegedly punched Esther in the face, knocking her to the ground, and began kicking her in the head. 

Her friends said that the assailant repeatedly kicked Esther in the head, even though her friends resisted, while she was lying on the ground defenseless, bleeding from her ears, nose, and mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/crime/woman-fights-for-her-life-following-brutal-assault-in-dubai-1.983864|title=Woman fights for her life following brutal assault in Dubai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as [[Ministry of Finance (Hawaii)|Minister of Finance]] during the reign of Queen [[Liliuokalani]], and was one of her trusted political advisor during the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]].

==Early life==
He was born in October 8, 1848 in Hawaii. His parents were Richard (or Henry) Macfarlane (died 1860) and Eliza Macfarlane (1828–1904). His father was Scottish, of the Highland [[Clan MacFarlane]], while his mother was of English descent from [[Devonshire]]. His parents married in [[Auckland]] and were early settlers of Hawaii arriving to the islands in 1846 via [[New Zealand]]. His brothers were: Henry R. Macfarlane, [[George W. Macfarlane]], who served on as Chamberlain of King [[Kalākaua]], Frederick W. Macfarlane and [[Clarence W. Macfarlane]]. A younger sister Helen Blanche Macfarlane married [[William H. Cornwell]].

He moved to California and worked for [[The Wasp (magazine)|''The Wasp'']], a [[San Francisco]] magazine, owned by Frank J. Ballinger, for a time before returning to Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Death" /&gt;

==Political career==
In the legislative election of 1890, Macfarlane ran and was successfully elected to the House of Nobles, the upper house of the [[Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii]], for a four-year term. He sat in the legislative assembly of 1890 during the reign of King Kalākaua and during the 1892–93 session under his successor Queen [[Liliuokalani|Liliʻuokalani]].&lt;ref name="1890Legislature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1892Legislature" /&gt; He was a member of the [[National Reform Party (Hawaii)|Hawaiian National Reform Party]] in the 1890 session and remain so in the following session.&lt;ref name="1890Legislature"&gt;{{harvnb|Hawaii|Lydecker|1918|page=178}}; {{cite news|title=Composition of he Legislature|newspaper=The Daily Bulletin|location=Honolulu|date=February 14, 1890|volume=|issue=|page=3|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1890-02-14/ed-1/seq-3/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1892Legislature"&gt;{{harvnb|Hawaii|Lydecker|1918|page=182}}; {{harvnb|Blount|1895|page=1138}}; {{cite news|title=List Of Candidates|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=February 3, 1892|volume=|issue=|page=4|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1892-02-03/ed-1/seq-4/}}; {{cite news|title=Legislature Of 1892|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=February 26, 1892|volume=|issue=|page=1|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1892-02-26/ed-1/seq-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 28, 1892 to January 14, 1893, the legislature of the Kingdom convened for an unprecedented 171 days, which later historian Albertine Loomis dubbed the "[[1892 Legislative Session of the Kingdom of Hawaii|Longest Legislature]]".&lt;ref name="Loomis"&gt;{{harvnb|Loomis|1963|pages=7–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This session was characterized by a divided legislature with no party holding control.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=549}}
On September 12, 1892, Macfarlane became the head of the so-called “Macfarlane Cabinet” and was appointed [[Ministry of Finance (Hawaii)|Minister of Finance]] after the previous cabinet under [[Hermann A. Widemann]] resigned. He formed his cabinet consisting of [[Samuel Parker (Hawaii)|Samuel Parker]], retaining him from the previous cabinet as minister of foreign affairs; [[Charles T. Gulick]], as minister of the interior; and [[Paul Neumann (Attorney General)|Paul Neumann]], as attorney general. Serving a mere five weeks, he and his colleagues were voted out by the legislature on a resolution of want of confidence, on October 17. The queen asked them to retain their position until she appointed a new cabinet on November 1.&lt;ref name="office"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macfarlane, Edward C. office record|work=state archives digital collections|publisher=state of Hawaii|archive-url=|archivedate=|url=https://digitalcollections.hawaii.gov/greenstone3/sites/localsite/collect/governm1/index/assoc/HASH01ce/51ba1ad5.dir/doc.pdf|deadurl=no|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=553–556}}&lt;ref name="1893Cabinets"&gt;{{cite news|title=A New Cabinet – Some New Ministers for the Public to Swallow|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=January 14, 1893|volume=XVII|issue=3277|page=4|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1893-01-14/ed-1/seq-4/|accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow of the monarchy]], Macfarlane accompanied Neumann and Prince [[David Kawānanakoa]] to represent the deposed queen's case to the United States government.{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|page=390}} Queen Liliuokalani regarded Macfarlane as a trusted advisor and confided with him during the overthrow.{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|page=242, 379–380}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Twigg-Smith|1998|pp=109–110, 179, 180–182, 351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in her 1898 memoir ''[[Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen]]'', she noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Macfarlane cabinet was one of the greatest popularity amongst the Hawaiian people on account of the stand Mr. Macfarlane took in the House, and his courage in replying to the false and uncalled-for speeches of [[John L. Stevens|J. L. Stevens]], the American Minister resident.{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|page=242}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later life and death==
After the establishment of the [[Territory of Hawaii]], he ran as a candidate of the [[Democratic Party of Hawaii|Democratic Party]] for the first [[Hawaii Territorial Legislature]], although he was not elected. Besides politic, he also engaged in business in Hawaii. He managed E. C. Macfarlane &amp; Company and was involved in the investment of Royal Hawaiian Hotel (not the current [[Royal Hawaiian Hotel|Waikiki hotel]]) with his brother George.&lt;ref name="Death" /&gt; On February 6, 1902, he married, in San Francisco, Florence Ballinger, the sister of Frank J. Ballinger, his former business partner. During their honeymoon, Macfarlane caught a cold and died of [[pleuropneumonia]] in [[Chicago]], on February 16, 1902; contradictory reports claimed he was either 53 or 49.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of E.

'''''Enab Baladi''''' ({{lang-ar|عنب بلدي}}) is a Syrian nonprofit media organization established in [[Darayya]], [[Syria]] in 2011.

==History and profile==
''Enab Baladi'' newspaper was first launched in 2011 by a group of citizen journalists and activists from Daraya, a Syrian town in Damascus suburbs. In January 29, 2012, issue #0 was published marking the beginning of a revolutionary newspaper. Since then, it has been printed each week on Sundays, with one two-week stoppage in August 2012 due to [[Darayya massacre]] committed by Assad forces.

Enab Baladi's mission is to serve a role in educating Syrian citizens through in-depth public interest reporting, including investigative journalism and news reports to elevate important social topics at the local level. Enab Baladi helps advance a democratic society in Syria by producing independent and credible journalism that informs the Syrian public about important issues.

Every week, a new issue of Enab Baladi newspaper is published. The publishing process takes two forms: print and digital. The print version is distributed in Syria as Enab Baladi currently prints around 7,000 copies every week and distributes them in northern parts of Syria (Aleppo and suburbs, Latakia and suburbs, and Idlib and suburbs) and in Turkey to Syrian refugees. The printing takes place in Turkey and then shipped to Syria. Enab Baladi used to print and distribute in the southern parts of Syria but after Assad forces destroyed its office and equipment in Daraya, the team was forced to start printing and distributing in northern Syria. The PDF version of the newspaper reaches hundreds of thousands of subscribers and fans, whether through electronic distribution list, Enab Baladi website and/or social media pages including over 0.65 million Facebook fans.

Since its establishment during the first year of the Syrian uprising, late 2011, EB has focused on promoting the peaceful resistance methods to counter the sectarian and violence narratives of the Syrian regime. Enab Baladi succeeded in providing the Syrian people with trusted information about events in Syria through its weekly newspaper. EB coverage included the human rights violations perpetrated by the Syrian regime, as well as the inception of the nascent Syrian civil society, in addition to various news and topics in the fields of politics, economy, and social affairs.

==Growth==
The newspaper grew from amateur-run organization into becoming one of the most prominent Syrian media organizations according to BBC Syria profile page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC Syria Media Profile|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14703914|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Enab Baladi produces several products, [http://www.enabbaladi.net/newspaper Enab Baladi Weekly Newspaper],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enab Baladi Weekly Newspaper|url=http://www.enabbaladi.org/newspaper|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [http://www.enabbaladi.net Enab Online News Service Website],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enab Online News Service Website|url=http://www.enabbaladi.org|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.syrianprints.org Syrian Print-Media Archive],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian Print-Media Archive|url=http://www.syrianprints.org|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its latest [http://english.enabbaladi.net English news website].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enab Baladi English|url=http://english.enabbaladi.net|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects are supported by a network of reporters and journalists who strive to give credible reports from the ground in Syria.

The French famous magazine “ELLE” published a story about EB’s women team, [http://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a28194/the-newsroom/ “THE "GANG OF GIRLS" RISKS THEIR LIVES TO REPORT FROM INSIDE A WAR ZONE”]. Around ten women are working as reporters, editors, and translators for EB. ELLE article tells the story of one of them, [[Kholoud Waleed]], and highlights the role that women played in the establishment of the newspaper, the challenges they faced during their work as citizen journalists in Syria and the success they achieved.

'''Failure to obey a police officer''', or '''failure to obey a police order''', is typically a [[misdemeanor]] in the [[United States]]{{clarify|date=April 2018}}. In [[Washington, DC]], this law is utilized primarily for purposes of ensuring that officers tasked with directing traffic have the authority to direct motorists and pedestrians in a proper and safe manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dcwatch.com/police/030125.htm |title=Final Report Relative to Complaints of Alleged Misconduct Made at the October 24, 2002, Hearing of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Council of the District of Columbia Concerning the IMF/World Bank Protest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006135953/http://dcwatch.com/police/030125.htm |archivedate=2010-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Virginia]], it is a misdemeanor to refuse to assist an officer in responding to a [[breach of the peace]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=§ 18.2-464.

==Canada==

In Canada, the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] makes it illegal for a motor vehicle driver to disobey an order to stop for a police officer.{{cn|date=October 2015}}  This includes [[wikibooks:Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offences/Flight from a Peace Officer|flight from a peace officer]].  Such a charge, other than those involving death or bodily harm, can be prosecuted either [[Summary offence#Canada|summarily]] or by [[indictment]].  Flight from police causing injury or death is always indictable, with maximum penalties of 14 years and [[Life imprisonment in Canada|life imprisonment]], respectively.  A conviction also comes with a mandatory [[driver licence]] suspension by the relevant [[Canadian provinces and territories|provincial or territorial]] [[Ministry of Transportation]] (e.g. [http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/driver/handbook/section4.8.5.shtml minimum 5-year suspension] of Ontario-wide driving privileges).

The '''GT4 European Series''' is a [[sports car racing|sports car]] championship created by the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation]] (SRO) and organised by GT-Future GmbH.  It is an amateur championship which followed a formula similar to the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]], which was itself derived from the [[FIA GT Championship]] which utilized the GT1 and GT2 classes.  The GT4 class cars are the least powerful of the four classes, yet are equalised in order to allow driving skill to become key.

==History==
Following the successful introduction of the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]] in 2006, the formula was expanded to include usage by other nationally based professional championships such as the [[British GT Championship]], [[Belcar]], [[Australian GT Championship]] and German [[ADAC GT Masters]]. While the FIA GT3 European Championship continues, the SRO felt that a true amateur championship was needed in order to complement GT3 which allowed a certain level of professional driver to compete. Many national series also adopted the GT4 regulations as a lower class, and the European Cup eventually lacked the competitors needed to continue. During the [[2016 24 Hours of Spa]], the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation]] (SRO) announced that the European Cup will be divided in 2 different series starting from 2017..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportscar365.com/sro/gt4-europe/gt4-european-series-splits-extended-calendar-for-2017/ |title=GT4 European Series Splits; Extended Schedule for 2017 |website=sportscar365.com|publisher=Jake Kilshaw|date=December 29, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are called the [[GT4 European Series Northern Cup]] and the [[GT4 European Series Southern Cup]]. The Northern Cup will be the same as the European Cup, while the Southern Cup will collect forces with the [[FFSA GT Championship]]. Since Stéphane Ratel spoke out about his firm belief in this class, many championships and constructors have followed. 

===Vehicles===
GT4 class cars are mostly what can be referred to as [[track day]] cars, which are factory-built race cars available to the public.  However, custom-built cars based on production models can also be built by teams.  All cars are test driven by the FIA and then modified so that they all have near identical performance levels.  Once a car has been approved by the FIA, it cannot be modified by the teams, eliminating continual development costs for constructors.  All cars run on regulated [[Pirelli]] tires and [[Continental AG|Continental]] tires to further equalize performance.

The following cars are currently homologated for GT4:

===Drivers===
Like GT3, GT4 drivers have a set of criteria which would automatically eliminate them from competition based on their level of experience.  Since GT4 class drivers are meant to be true amateurs, these criteria are tighter than that seen in GT3.

Drivers under the age of 30 are not allowed to have had a top-ten finish in any national or international single-seater championship, nor to have had a distinguishable career in a national or international GT championship.  These drivers are known as Silver drivers.  Drivers over the age of 30 who did not receive their racing licenses until after turning 30 and having no single-seater experience at all are also allowed in the series, under the term Bronze drivers.

===Races===
Just as in GT3, each event would consist of two races of equal distance, usually held on different days.  Teams were not required to have two drivers and could use the same driver for each race.

===Championship===
The championship used the standard FIA point scheme for the top ten finishers: 25-18-15-12-10-8-6-4-2-1.  If a team used different drivers for each race in a single event, both drivers would receive points.  A driver and team championship were both held.

If at least five cars of the same make participate in a race, then a manufacturer cup would also be awarded, similar to the style used in GT3.

Since the introduction of the GT4 European Cup, the GT4 class of cars have been expanded to various national series.

The law excluded, until December 31, 2001, from government, parliament and judiciary, and mass media positions any higher political officials who held office in Albania prior to March 31, 1991, i.e., who held higher positions in Communist Albania: members of [[politburo]], [[Central Committee]], parliament, as well as former [[secret police]] agents and informers.&lt;ref name=omri950925/&gt;&lt;ref name=ij&gt;"Eastern Europe at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century: A Guide to the Economies in Transition", by Ian Jeffries, {{ISBN|0-415-23671-1}}, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=L7PBtDujYt0C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=%22law+on+communist+genocide%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T7sLSdSfnE&amp;sig=02adZ82A9lDmOfTSvSDx2ctYXvo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h8GSSqGmKY2ssgOZ55gM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22law%20on%20communist%20genocide%22&amp;f=false p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt; It was similar to [[decommunization]] efforts in other former [[communist state]]s.

A person may run for an office after an investigation of their "moral character" by a special state commission. The commission decision may be appealed before the Cassation Court.

An attempt to repeal the law basing on its alleged unconstitutionality&lt;ref name=cwatch/&gt; was rejected by the [[constitutional court]] on January 31, 1996.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; However some provisions of the law were stricken out.&lt;ref name=cwatch/&gt;

Basing on this law, former President [[Ramiz Alia]], previously amnestied, was imprisoned again, now on charges for [[crime against humanity]]. Some decried this application of the law as an example of [[double jeopardy]].&lt;ref name=cwatch/&gt;

The law lasted only two years, because it was repealed during the [[1997 rebellion in Albania]], and eventually formerly banned politicians entered the coalition government.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt;

The '''Greater Gulf State Fair''' is an annual [[fair]] and [[agricultural show]] that is held at the Greater Gulf State Fairgrounds in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]]. It features [[livestock]] competitions, [[roller coasters|rides]], concessions, motor contests, and concerts. It has been held every year since 1955, and moved to its current location in 1974. The event's name stems from its serving of people from [[Lower Alabama]], [[Lower Mississippi]], and the [[Panhandle of Florida]]. It is the largest fair in the state of Alabama.

==Background==
The Greater Gulf State Fair began as a fund-raising initiative for the Mobile Jaycees, a group of members of the Mobile Junior Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegroundsmobile.com/content/ggsf-1.html|title=The Greater Gulf State Fair|publisher=TheGroundsMobile.com|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first held at [[Blakeley Island (Alabama)|Blakeley Island]] in 1955,&lt;ref name="al"/&gt; and drew 60,000 people in its inaugural year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCEEAAAAMBAJ|title=Mobile, Ala.

With the event gaining success, the Jaycees hired a president to oversee planning in 1958.&lt;ref name="al"/&gt; During these years, the event took place at [[Ladd Stadium]], and later at Hartwell Field in Mobile.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCAEAAAAMBAJ|title=Free Name Act Show Boosts Mobile Fair|date=October 24, 1960|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|The Billboard]]|issn=0006-2510|pages=56–58|volume=72|issue=4|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the Fair moved to its permanent residence at the Greater Gulf State Fairgrounds in west Mobile. It was renamed "the Grounds" in 2014.

The rides present at each Fair are a combination of the Fair that begins in [[Canada]], travels down opposite seaboards, and regroups in Mobile.&lt;ref name="al"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/60th_greater_gulf_state_fair_i.html|title=60th Greater Gulf State Fair in Mobile focuses on the family|date=October 29, 2014|work=[[Press-Register]]|publisher=AL.com|author=Angela Lewis|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lonnie Franklin, Jr. was born on August 30, 1952. He grew up in [[South Central Los Angeles]], [[California]]. He married and had two children. He was given a [[general discharge]] from the [[United States Army]] on July 24, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Pelisek |first= Christine |title=Accused Grim Sleeper Lonnie Franklin Jr. Is the Ringmaster of His Own Murder Trial |url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/accused-grim-sleeper-lonnie-franklin-jr-is-the-ringmaster-of-his-own-murder-trial-4504291 |publisher=LA Weekly |date= 14 March 2014 |accessdate=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;url= http://www.people.com/article/grim-sleeper-serial-killer-lonnie-franklin-sentenced&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin's criminal record dates back to 1989. He was convicted of two charges of theft, one charge of misdemeanor assault, and one charge of [[Battery (crime)|battery]]. He served time for one of the theft charges.&lt;ref name=abcnews1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/familys-dna-led-police-grim-sleeper-serial-killer/story?id=11116381&amp;page=2|title=New Technique of Using Family's DNA Led Police to 'Grim Sleeper' Suspect|publisher=ABC News|date=2010-07-08|accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
In the 1980s, the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] marked the deaths of several women in [[South Los Angeles, California|South Los Angeles]] with the identification “NHI”, meaning No Humans Involved - which was used for cases involving chronic drug users and prostitutes. Margaret Prescod formed the "Black Women Count" movement with community members to pressure the LAPD into acknowledging the deaths as serial killings and forming a task force in response. The coalition launched a media campaign and set a monetary reward aiming to capture the killer. The joint LAPD-[[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] investigation determined that the crimes were committed by a single person labeled the "Southside Slayer". Their results were announced to the public on September 23, 1985.&lt;ref name=SSS/&gt;

According to investigators, evidence was found suggesting that several serial killers were murdering women in South Los Angeles. Louis Craine committed at least two of the "Southside Slayer" murders, and [[Michael Hughes (serial killer)|Michael Hughes]], [[Daniel Lee Siebert]], [[Chester Turner]], and Ivan Hill committed at least one each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Map: Serial Killers in South L.A. |work= Los Angeles Times |date= 3 August 2010 |url= http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-serialkillersmap-0804-i,0,515310.htmlstory |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate series of killings commenced with the murder of Debra Jackson and a different ''[[modus operandi]]'' involving a firearm.&lt;ref name=SSS&gt;{{cite web |last= Jones |first= Jack |title= Man Sought in Slayings of 10 L.A.-Area Prostitutes |work= Los Angeles Times |publisher= |date= 24 September 1985 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-24/news/mn-18536_1 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These became known, misleadingly, as the "Strawberry Murders." Sheriff's Detective Rickey Ross was wrongfully arrested due to a ballistics error. Two decades later, the perpetrator of these crimes was dubbed the "Grim Sleeper" due to the long period of apparent inactivity between murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jill Stewart |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2010-07-15/news/missing-the-grim-sleeper-by-a-hair/1 |title=Missing the Grim Sleeper by a Hair|work=LA Weekly |date=2010-07-15 |accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, the slaying of Janecia Peters, 25, was linked through [[DNA]] analysis to at least eleven unsolved murders in Los Angeles, the first of which occurred in 1985. This same year, in secrecy, the LAPD formed the "800 Task Force," composed of six detectives and overseen by the Robbery-Homicide Unit. After a four-month investigation, ''[[LA Weekly]]'' [[investigative journalism|investigative reporter]] Christine Pelisek broke the news of the task force's existence, the link between Peters' killing and the earlier murders, and the silence of [[Mayor of Los Angeles|Mayor]] [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] and Police Chief [[William J. Bratton]] regarding the killer's existence. Villaraigosa and Bratton neither issued a press release nor warned the community. In some cases, ''LA Weekly'' was the first to inform the families that their daughters had long been confirmed as victims of a serial killer.&lt;ref name=LAWeekly0/&gt;

In early September 2008, Los Angeles officials announced that they were offering a $500,000 reward to help catch the killer.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; On November 1, the case was featured on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] program ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amw.com/fugitives/brief.cfm?id=60381/ |title=Most Wanted fugitives website (defunct) |date= |work=[[America's Most Wanted]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022040939/http://www.amw.com/ |archivedate=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 25, 2009, Bratton addressed the press for the first time regarding the case, at which time the police formally gave the killer the "Grim Sleeper" nickname chosen by ''LA Weekly''. Bratton also released a [[9-1-1]] call from the 1980s in which a man reported seeing a body being dumped by the Grim Sleeper, giving a detailed description and license plate number of a van connected with the now-closed Cosmopolitan Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pelisek |first=Christine |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/1tape-may-hold-clue-to-identif/ |title=Tape May Hold Clue to Identifying Grim Sleeper Serial Killer – Los Angeles News – The Informer |publisher=Blogs.laweekly.com |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, Pelisek conducted an extensive interview with Enietra Washington, the sole survivor of the Grim Sleeper's attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christine Pelisek |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-08-28/news/grim-sleeper/4 |title=Grim Sleeper Returns: He's Murdering Angelenos, as Cops Hunt his DNA|work=LA Weekly |date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAWeekly1&gt;{{cite web |author=Christine Pelisek |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-03-12/news/grim-sleeper-39-s-sole-survivor/2 |title=Grim Sleeper's Sole Survivor|work=LA Weekly |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington described him as "a black man in his early 30s...He looked neat. Tidy. Kind of geeky. He wore a black polo shirt tucked into khaki trousers." She also described the interior and exterior of his vehicle.&lt;ref name=survive&gt;{{cite web |author=Christine Pelisek |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-03-12/news/grim-sleeper-39-s-sole-survivor/ |title=Grim Sleeper's Sole Survivor|work=LA Weekly |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
On July 7, 2010, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that an arrest had been made. [[Los Angeles County District Attorney|Los Angeles District Attorney]] Steve Cooley identified the suspect as 57-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr., a mechanic who worked between 1981 and 1988 for the City of Los Angeles in the sanitation department and briefly for the LAPD.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; Franklin was identified for arrest, at least in part, on [[DNA profiling#DNA evidence as evidence in criminal trials|familial DNA analysis]].&lt;ref name=latimesblog&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/07/lapd-make-arrest-in-grim-sleeper-serial-killings.html |title=LAPD make arrest in Grim Sleeper serial killings |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date= 2010-07-07|accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police had found no exact match between DNA found at the crime scenes and any of the profiles in California's DNA profile database, so they searched the database for stored profiles that demonstrated sufficient similarity to allow police to infer a familial relationship. They found similar DNA belonging to Franklin's son, Christopher, who had been convicted of a [[felony]] weapons charge. According to Cooley, detectives then used a piece of discarded pizza with Franklin's DNA to make the link. One undercover police officer pretended to be a waiter at a restaurant where Franklin ate, collecting dishes, silverware, glasses, and pizza crusts to obtain DNA.&lt;ref name=yahoonews1/&gt; The identification was used to arrest Franklin after his DNA was obtained and deemed a match.&lt;ref name=CNN1/&gt; Saliva found on the victims established a DNA match linking Franklin to the deaths.&lt;ref name=abcnews1/&gt;

Law enforcement missed an opportunity to catch Franklin because his DNA was never collected. In 2003, Franklin was convicted of a felony and was serving three years of supervised [[probation]]. In 2004, voters passed [[California Proposition 69 (2004)|Proposition 69]], which requires that DNA must be collected from all felons and everyone arrested on some specified charges. It also requires the expansion of the DNA database. Authorities collected and sorted through thousands of DNA samples. While he was on probation, Franklin's DNA was supposed to be entered in the system, but was not as probation officers did not collect samples from people who were on unsupervised probation between November 2004 and August 2005. The probation department did not have the resources to collect samples until August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/15/local/la-me-grim-sleeper-dna-20100715|title=Authorities Missed A Chance to Catch Grim Sleeper Suspect|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-07-15|accessdate=2010-07-23|first=Jack|last=Leonard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2010, the LAPD released 180 photos of women found in Franklin's home after unsuccessful attempts to identify the individuals, possibly additional victims. "These people are not suspects, we don't even know if they are victims, but we do know this: Lonnie Franklin's reign of terror in the city of Los Angeles, which spanned well over two decades, culminating with almost a dozen murder victims, certainly needs to be investigated further," said Police Chief [[Charlie Beck]]. In all, investigators found over 1,000 photos and several hundred hours of video in his home.&lt;ref name=reuters1&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitcomb |first=Dan |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BF6EU20101216 |title=L.A. police release photos of possible Grim Sleeper victims |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-12-16|accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images show mainly black women of a wide age range, from teenagers to middle-aged and older, often nude. Police believe Franklin took many of the pictures, which show both conscious and unconscious individuals, dating back 30 years.&lt;ref name=reuters1/&gt; The photos were released to the public in an effort to identify the women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hayes |first=Kevin |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20026038-504083.html |title="Grim Sleeper" Photos: LAPD Deluged with Calls - Crimesider |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/grim-sleeper-serial-killer-victim-photos-released-los/story?id=12424559 |title=Five Women Tentatively Identified in 'Grim Sleeper' Cas - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2011, [[Reuters]] reported that the police were considering Franklin as a suspect in six more slayings of additional female victims. The police were investigating two of the six as potential victims killed during a 14-year lapse between an initial spate of Grim Sleeper murders that ended in 1988 and several more that began in 2002. Of the remaining four victims, two bodies were discovered in the 1980s and two were reported missing in 2005 but the remains of the other two were never found, police said. Detectives said they linked Franklin to the six additional killings after reviewing hundreds of old case files and seeking the public's help in identifying a collection of 180 photographs of women and girls that were found in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Kandel |first= Jason |title= Police tie "Grim Sleeper" suspect to six more killings |work= |publisher= Reuters |date= 3 November 2011 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/03/us-crime-grimsleeper-idUSTRE7A20L120111103 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Rubin |first= Joel |title= Police link 6 more slayings to Grim Sleeper suspect |work= Los Angeles Times |publisher= |date= 29 October 2011 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/29/local/la-me-grim-sleeper-20111029 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Olivia |first= Katrandjian |author2=Lauren Effron |author3=Lauren Sher |author4=Neal Karlinsky |title= Six More Deaths Linked to Grim Sleeper Serial Killer |work= abc NIGHTLINE |publisher= abc NEWS |date= 29 October 2011 |url= http://abcnews.go.com/US/deaths-linked-grim-sleeper-serial-killer/story?id=14842183#.TwMkn_KDtXU |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
The known killings began in 1985 in South Los Angeles. The "Grim Sleeper" apparently took a 14-year hiatus after his last known crime in 1988 and the murders that resumed in 2002 (leading to the epithet by which he is known), but this history may be only an accident of the evidence collected. The last confirmed slaying was in January 2007.&lt;ref name=abcnews1/&gt; All of his victims were found outdoors, often in alleys a short distance from downtown Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/07/07/arrest-la-grim-sleeper-killings/|title=Arrest Made in L.A.

All but one of his victims were black women. One of his suspected victims was a black man.&lt;ref name=LATimes1/&gt; Many of his victims were prostitutes.  One witness recalls that Franklin frequently brought prostitutes into his home. He shot all of his victims with a .25 caliber gun.&lt;ref name=abcnews1/&gt; Franklin took many photographs of nude women and kept the records in his garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100708/ap_on_re_us/us_grim_sleeper_killings_23|title=Accused LA Serial Killer Said to Visit Prostitutes |publisher=Yahoo!

It was created by The Institut national de l'audiovisuel (or [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]], the French for National Audiovisual Institute). The first IMAGINA festival was held in 1981, while the actual name IMAGINA was only introduced in 1986. It is sometimes compared to the CG festival part of  [[SIGGRAPH]]. In 2000, the festival was sold to the Monte-Carlo television festival, which decided to switch towards a meeting targeting professionals.

An '''international monetary system''' is a set of internationally agreed rules, conventions and supporting institutions that facilitate [[international trade]], [[Foreign direct investment|cross border investment]] and generally the [[redistribution (economics)|reallocation of capital]] between [[nation state]]s. It should provide means of payment acceptable to buyers and sellers of different nationalities, including deferred payment. To operate successfully, it needs to inspire confidence, to provide sufficient liquidity for fluctuating levels of trade, and to provide means by which global imbalances can be corrected. The system can grow organically as the collective result of numerous individual agreements between international economic factors spread over several decades. Alternatively, it can arise from a single architectural vision, as happened at [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] in 1944.

==Historical overview==
{{See also|Reserve currency}}
Throughout history, precious metals such as [[gold]] and [[silver]] have been used for trade, sometimes in the form of [[bullion]], and from early history the coins of various issuers – generally kingdoms and empires – have been traded. The earliest known records of pre-coinage use of precious metals for monetary exchange are from Mesopotamia and Egypt,  dating from the third millennium BC.&lt;ref name = "money a history" &gt;{{cite book
  | editor= Jonathan Williams with Joe Cribb and Elizabeth Errington
  | title = Money a History
  | year = 1997
  | ISBN = 0-7141-0885-5
  | pages = 16–27 , 111 ,127 ,  131 , 136 , 136 , 
  | publisher = British Museum Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early money took many forms, apart from bullion; for instance bronze [[spade money]] which became common in [[Zhou dynasty]] China in the late 7th century BC. At that time, forms of money were also developed in [[Lydia]] in [[Asia Minor]], from where its use spread to nearby Greek cities and later to many other places.&lt;ref name = "money a history" /&gt;

Sometimes formal [[monetary system]]s have been imposed by regional rulers. For example, scholars have tentatively suggested that the Roman king [[Servius Tullius]] created a primitive monetary system in the early history of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Tullius reigned in the sixth century BC - several centuries before Rome is believed to have developed a formal coinage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | publisher =WileyBlackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with bullion, early use of coinage is believed to have been generally the preserve of the elite. But by about the 4th century BC coins were widely used in Greek cities. They were generally supported by the city state authorities, who endeavoured to ensure they retained their values regardless of fluctuations in the availability of whatever base or precious metals they were made from.&lt;ref name = "money a history" /&gt; From Greece the use of coins spread slowly westwards throughout Europe, and eastwards to India. Coins were in use in India from about 400 BC; initially they played a greater role in religion than in trade, but by the 2nd century{{clarify|date=August 2018}} they had become central to commercial transactions.  Monetary systems that were developed in India were so successful that they spread through parts of Asia well into the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name = "money a history" /&gt;

As a variety of coins became common within a region, they were exchanged by [[moneychanger]]s, the predecessors of today's [[foreign exchange market]], as mentioned in the Biblical story of [[Jesus and the money changers]]. In Venice and the other Italian city states of the early Middle Ages, money changers would often have to struggle to perform calculations involving six or more currencies. This partly led to [[Fibonacci]] writing his [[Liber Abaci]] which popularised the use of [[Arabic numerals|Indo-Arabic numerals]], which displaced the more difficult Roman numerals then in use by western merchants.&lt;ref name="Ascent "&gt;

[[File:International money montage.jpg|thumb|left| Historic international currencies. From top left: crystalline [[gold]], a 5th-century BCE [[Persian daric]], an 8th-century English [[mancus]], and an 18th-century [[Spanish real]].]]
When a given nation or empire has achieved regional [[hegemony]], its currency has been a basis for international trade, and hence for a ''de facto'' monetary system. In the West – Europe and the Middle East – an early such coin was the [[Persian daric]]. This was succeeded by [[Roman currency]] of the [[Roman Empire]], such as the [[denarius]], then the [[Gold Dinar]] of the Ottoman Empire, and later – from the 16th to 20th centuries, during the [[Age of Imperialism]] – by the currency of European colonial powers: the [[Spanish dollar]], the [[Dutch guilder]], the [[French franc]] and the [[British pound sterling]]; at times one currency has been pre-eminent, at times no one dominated. With the growth of American power, the [[US dollar]] became the basis for the international monetary system, formalised in the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] agreement that established the post–World War II monetary order, with fixed exchange rates of other currencies to the dollar, and [[convertibility]] of the dollar into gold. The Bretton Woods system broke down, culminating in the [[Nixon shock]] of 1971, ending convertibility; but the US dollar has remained the ''de facto'' basis of the world monetary system, though no longer ''de jure''{{dubious|date=August 2018}}, with various European currencies and the [[Japanese yen]] also being prominent in foreign exchange markets. Since the formation of the [[Euro]], the Euro has also gained use as a [[reserve currency]] and a medium of transactions, though the dollar has remained the most important currency.

A dominant currency may be used directly or indirectly by other nations: for example, English kings minted the gold [[mancus]], presumably to function as dinars to exchange with [[Islamic Spain]]; colonial powers sometimes minted coins that resembled those already used in a distant territory; and more recently, a number of nations have used the US dollar as their local currency, a custom called [[dollarization]].

Until the 19th century, the global monetary system was loosely linked at best, with Europe, the Americas, India and China (among others) having largely separate economies, and hence monetary systems were regional. [[European colonization of the Americas]], starting with the Spanish empire, led to the integration of American and European economies and monetary systems, and European colonization of Asia led to the dominance of European currencies, notably the British pound sterling in the 19th century, succeeded by the US dollar in the 20th century. Some, such as [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]], foresee the decline of a single base for the global monetary system, and the emergence instead of regional [[trade bloc]]s; he cites the emergence of the Euro as an example. See also [[Global financial system]]s, [[world-systems approach]] and [[polarity in international relations]]. It was in the later half of the 19th century that a monetary system with close to universal global participation emerged, based on the gold standard.

==History of modern global monetary orders==

===The pre WWI financial order: 1816–1919===
{{Main|Gold Standard#Establishment of the international gold standard}}

[[File:Gold Bars.jpg|thumb|The [[gold standard]] widely adopted in this era rested on the conversion of paper notes into pre-set quantities of gold.]]
From the 1816 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the world benefited from a well-integrated financial order, sometimes known as the "first age of globalisation".&lt;ref name = "GPE"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally also called the ''golden age of capitalism'' in older sources,  and also the ''first golden age of capitalism'' in later sources that recognise golden age that spanned approx 1951–73. A few economists such as [[Barry Eichengreen]] date the ''first age of globalisation'' as starting in the early 1860s with the laying of the first transatlantic cables between Great Britain and the USA.&lt;/ref&gt;
There were monetary unions which enabled member countries to accept each others' currencies as legal tender. Such unions included the [[Latin Monetary Union]] (Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, France) and the [[Scandinavian monetary union]] (Denmark, Norway and Sweden). In the absence of shared membership of a union, transactions were facilitated by widespread participation in the [[gold standard]], by both independent nations and their colonies. Great Britain was at the time the world's pre-eminent financial, imperial, and industrial power, ruling more of the world and exporting more capital as a percentage of her national income than any other creditor nation has since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

While capital controls comparable to the Bretton Woods system were not in place, damaging capital flows were far less common than they were to be in the post 1971 era. In fact Great Britain's capital exports helped to correct global imbalances as they tended to be counter-cyclical, rising when Britain's economy went into recession, thus compensating other states for income lost from export of goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Accordingly, this era saw mostly steady growth and a relatively low level of financial crises. In contrast to the Bretton Woods system, the pre–World War I financial order was not created at a single high level conference; rather it evolved organically in a series of discrete steps. The [[Gilded Age]], a time of especially rapid development in North America, falls into this period.

===Between the World Wars: 1919–1939===
[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|left|This era saw periods of worldwide economic hardship. The image is [[Dorothea Lange]]'s ''[[Migrant Mother]]'' depiction of destitute [[pea-pickers]] in [[California]], taken in March 1936.]]
The years between the world wars have been described as a period of "de-globalisation", as both international trade and capital flows shrank compared to the period before World War I. During World War I, countries had abandoned the gold standard. Except for the United States, they later returned to it only briefly. By the early 1930s, the prevailing order was essentially a fragmented system of floating exchange rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In this era, the experience of Great Britain and others was that the gold standard ran counter to the need to retain domestic policy autonomy. To protect their reserves of gold, countries would sometimes need to raise interest rates and generally follow a deflationary policy. The greatest need for this could arise in a downturn, just when leaders would have preferred to lower rates to encourage growth. Economist Nicholas Davenport

had even argued that the wish to return Britain to the gold standard "sprang from a sadistic desire by the Bankers to inflict pain on the British working class."

By the end of World War I, Great Britain was heavily indebted to the United States, allowing the USA to largely displace it as the world's foremost financial power. The United States, however, was reluctant to assume Great Britain's leadership role, partly due to isolationist influences and a focus on domestic concerns. In contrast to Great Britain in the previous era, capital exports from the US were not countercyclical. They expanded rapidly with the United States' economic growth in the 1920s until 1928, but then almost completely halted as the US economy began slowing in that year. As the [[Great Depression]] intensified in 1930, financial institutions were hit hard along with trade; in 1930 alone, 1345 US banks collapsed.

During the 1930s, the United States raised trade barriers, refused to act as an international [[lender of last resort]], and refused calls to cancel war debts, all of which further aggravated economic hardship for other countries. According to economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], another factor contributing to the turbulent economic performance of this era was the insistence of French premier [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] that Germany pay [[World War I reparations|war reparations]] at too high a level, which Keynes described in his book [[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]].

===The Bretton Woods Era: 1944–1973===
{{Main|Bretton Woods system}}
[[File:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Harry Dexter White]] (left) and [[John Maynard Keynes]] (right) at [[Bretton Woods Conference|Bretton Woods]]]]

British and American policy makers began to plan the post-war international monetary system in the early 1940s. The objective was to create an order that combined the benefits of an integrated and relatively liberal international system with the freedom for governments to pursue domestic policies aimed at promoting full employment and social wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The principal architects of the new system, John Maynard Keynes and [[Harry Dexter White]], created a plan which was endorsed by the 42 countries attending the 1944 [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods conference]], formally known as the [[United Nations]] Monetary and Financial Conference. The plan involved nations agreeing to a system of fixed but adjustable{{clarify|date=August 2018}} exchange rates so that the currencies were pegged against the dollar, with the dollar itself convertible into gold. So in effect this was a gold – dollar exchange standard. There were a number of improvements on the old gold standard. Two international institutions, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] were created. A key part of their function was to replace private finance as a more reliable source of lending for investment projects in developing states. At the time the soon to be defeated powers of Germany and Japan were envisaged as states soon to be in need of such development, and there was a desire from both the US and Britain not to see the defeated powers saddled with punitive sanctions that would inflict lasting pain on future generations. The new exchange rate system allowed countries facing economic hardship to devalue their currencies by up to 10% against the dollar (more if approved by the IMF) – thus they would not be forced to undergo deflation to stay in the gold standard. A system of capital controls was introduced to protect countries from the damaging effects of capital flight and to allow countries to pursue independent macro economic policies
&lt;ref&gt;According to Keynes: "In my view the whole management of the domestic economy depends on being free to have the appropriate rate of interest without reference to rates prevailing elsewhere in the world. Capital control is a corollary to this"
&lt;/ref&gt;
while still welcoming flows intended for productive investment. Keynes had argued against the dollar having such a central role in the monetary system, and suggested an international currency called [[bancor]] be used instead, but he was overruled by the Americans. Towards the end of the Bretton Woods era, the central role of the dollar became a problem as international demand eventually forced the US to run a persistent trade deficit, which undermined confidence in the dollar. This, together with the emergence of a parallel market for gold in which the price soared above the official US mandated price, led to speculators running down the US gold reserves. Even when convertibility was restricted to nations only, some, notably France,&lt;ref name = "Copeland"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued building up hoards of gold at the expense of the US. Eventually these pressures caused [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] to end all convertibility into gold on 15 August 1973. This event marked the effective end of the Bretton Woods system; attempts were made to find other mechanisms to preserve the fixed exchange rates over the next few years, but they were not successful, resulting in a system of floating exchange rates.&lt;ref name = "Copeland"/&gt;

===The post Bretton Woods system: 1973– present===
{{Main|Washington Consensus}}
[[File:NYC NYSE.jpg|thumb|left|The [[New York Stock Exchange]]. The current era has seen huge and turbulent flows of capital between nations.]]

An alternative name for the post Bretton Woods system is the '''Washington Consensus'''. While the name was coined in 1989, the associated economic system came into effect years earlier: according to economic historian [[Robert Skidelsky|Lord Skidelsky]] the ''Washington Consensus'' is generally seen as spanning 1980–2009 (the latter half of the 1970s being a transitional period).&lt;ref name = "return"&gt;

The transition away from Bretton Woods was marked by a [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|switch]] from a state led to a market led system.&lt;ref name="GPE"/&gt; The  Bretton Wood system is considered by economic historians to have broken down in the 1970s:&lt;ref name = "return"/&gt; crucial events being [[Richard Nixon#Economy|Nixon suspending the dollar's convertibility into gold]] in 1973, the United States' abandonment of capital controls in 1974, and the UK's ending of capital controls in 1979 which was swiftly copied by most other major economies.

In some parts of the developing world, liberalisation brought significant benefits for large sections of the population – most prominently with [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s [[Economic reforms in China|reforms in China]] since 1978 and the liberalisation of India after its [[1991 India economic crisis|1991 crisis]].

Generally the industrial nations experienced much slower growth and higher unemployment than in the previous era, and according to Professor Gordon Fletcher in retrospect the 1950s and 60s when the Bretton Woods system was operating came to be seen as a [[Golden Age of Capitalism|golden age]].

Financial crises have been more intense and have increased in frequency by about 300% – with the damaging effects prior to 2008 being chiefly felt in the emerging economies. On the positive side, at least until 2008 investors have frequently achieved very high rates of return, with salaries and bonuses in the financial sector reaching record levels.

From 2004, economists such as Michael P. Dooley, Peter M. Garber, and David Folkerts-Landau began writing papers describing the emergence of a new international system involving an interdependency between states with generally high savings in Asia lending and exporting to western states with generally high spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael P. |last=Dooley |first2=David |last2=Folkerts‐Landau |first3=Peter |last3=Garber |title=The Revived Bretton Woods System |journal=International Journal of Finance and Economics |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=307–313 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/ijfe.250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the original ''Bretton Woods'', this included Asian currencies being pegged to the dollar, though this time by the unilateral intervention of Asian governments in the currency market to stop their currencies appreciating. The developing world as a whole stopped running current account deficits in 1999

– widely seen as a response to unsympathetic treatment following the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]]. The most striking example of east-west interdependency is the relationship between China and America, which [[Niall Ferguson]] calls [[Chimerica]]. From 2004, This supposed "New Bretton Woods",&lt;ref&gt;*[[Robert Brenner]], "What is Good for Goldman Sachs is Good for America The Origins of the Present Crisis" (October 2, 2009).

Dialynas and Marshall Auerback, PIMCO&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since at least 2007 those authors have also called for a new ''de jure'' system: for key international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank to be revamped to meet the demands of the current age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/13197.html

|author1=Michael P. Dooley |author2=David Folkerts-Landau |author3=Peter Garber |publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]]
|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and between 2008 and mid-2009 the term ''New Bretton Woods'' was increasingly used in the latter sense. By late 2009, with less emphases on structural reform to the international monetary system and more attention being paid to issues such as [[Balance of payments|re-balancing]] the world economy.

Since 2011, [[Sanjeev Sanyal]], a colleague of Dooley, Garber and Folkerts-Landau has taken the framework a step further to argue that periods of global economic expansions are almost always underpinned by symbiotic imbalances. Such imbalances cause distortions but are an inevitable part of expanding economic ecosystems. Thus, he argues that the next round of economic growth will again be underpinned by a return to global imbalances, probably with China supplying capital and the US again running deficits to absorb it. He names this relationship Bretton Woods III.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-economy-imbalances-by-sanjeev-sanyal-2014-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calls for a "New Bretton Woods"==
[[File:Cumbre de Washington.jpg|thumb|250px|G-20 leaders at [[2008 G-20 Washington summit|Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy]].]]
Leading financial journalist [[Martin Wolf]] has reported that all financial crises since 1971 have been preceded by large [[Capital account|capital inflows]] into affected regions. While ever since the seventies there have been numerous calls from the [[global justice movement]] for a revamped international system to tackle the problem of unfettered capital flows, it was not until late 2008 that this idea began to receive substantial support from leading politicians. On September 26, 2008, [[Nicolas Sarkozy|French President Nicolas Sarkozy]], then also the [[President of the European Union]], said, "We must rethink the financial system from scratch, as at Bretton Woods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

said world leaders must meet to agree to a new economic system: {{cquote| We must have a new Bretton Woods, building a new international financial architecture for the years ahead. }}
However, Brown's approach was quite different from the original [[Bretton Woods system]], emphasising the continuation of [[globalization]] and [[free trade]] as opposed to a return to fixed exchange rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Also during March 2009, in a speech entitled ''Reform the International Monetary System'', [[Zhou Xiaochuan]], the governor of the [[People's Bank of China]] came out in favour of Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Dr Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that part of the reason for the Bretton Woods system breaking down was the failure to adopt Keynes's [[bancor]]. Dr Zhou said that national currencies were unsuitable for use as global reserve currencies as a result of the [[Triffin dilemma]] – the difficulty faced by reserve currency issuers in trying to simultaneously achieve their domestic monetary policy goals and meet other countries' demand for reserve currency. Dr Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs) as a centrally managed global reserve currency &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2009 article published in [[Foreign Affairs]] magazine, economist [[C. Fred Bergsten]] argued that Dr Zhou's suggestion or a similar change to the international monetary system would be in  the United States' best interests as well as the rest of the world's.&lt;ref name = "Bersten"&gt;{{cite web

Leaders meeting in April at the [[2009 G-20 London summit]] agreed to allow $250 Billion of SDRs to be created by the IMF, to be distributed to all IMF members according to each countries voting rights.  In the aftermath of the  summit, Gordon Brown declared "the Washington Consensus is over".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Prime-Minister-Gordon-Brown-G20-Will-Pump-One-Trillion-Dollars-Into-World-Economy/Article/200904115254629| title=Prime Minister Gordon Brown: G20 Will Pump Trillion Dollars Into World Economy| date=2 April 2009| publisher=''[[Sky News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in a [[Keynes: The Return of the Master|book]] published during September 2009, Professor [[Robert Skidelsky]], an international expert on [[Keynesianism]], argued it was still too early to say whether a new international monetary system was emerging.&lt;ref name = "return"/&gt;

On Jan 27, in his opening address to the [[World Economic Forum|2010 World Economic Forum]] in Davos,  President Sarkozy repeated his call for a new Bretton Woods, and was met by wild applause by a sizeable proportion of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In December 2011, the [[Bank of England]] published a paper arguing for reform, saying that the current International monetary system has performed poorly compared to the ''Bretton Woods system''. 
&lt;ref name = "COEDec2011"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 in an ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' op-ed, Harvard University professor and director of the [[Committee on Capital Markets Regulation]] [[Hal S. Scott]] called for a global response to the [[European sovereign debt crisis|Euro-zone crisis]]. He wrote that two failures to address European problems around German power had led to world wars in the 20th century and that the current crisis was also beyond the capacity of Europe, with Germany again at the center, to solve on their own. Accepting that leadership transitions were underway in both China and America, Scott called on all concerned—with Japan included with China and America—to begin organizing a global restructuring through the [[International Monetary Fund]] with possibly a Bretton Woods II conference as part of the process.

  |accessdate=2012-08-16}}  
&lt;/ref&gt; 
''[[MarketWatch]]'' commentator Darrell Delamaide endorsed Scott's idea but concluded "unfortunately it’s not likely to happen". He added first the example of the failure of Europe to address successfully the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]] without outside assistance as a reason for his endorsement. But he found U.S. presidential and Treasury Department leadership and IMF leadership dramatically lacking in the capacity to mount an initiative such as Scott proposed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7837">'''John Fare''' (sometimes '''John Charles Fare''' or '''John Fahey''' or '''John Faré''') is a fictional [[performance artist]] who allegedly used robotic surgery to remove parts of his body onstage as part of his act. His final performance was allegedly [[suicide by beheading]]. The story originated in 1968 and is generally considered an [[urban legend]].&lt;ref name="cramer"&gt;Cramer, Florian (2006).

''Studio International'' (#949), pp. 160&amp;ndash;161.&lt;/ref&gt; The reader was inquiring about an artist named Fahey who ended his career by having his head amputated onstage.&lt;ref&gt;''Apocalypse Culture'', Adam Parfrey, Feral House, 1991, 2nd ed., pp. 95&amp;ndash;96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ooz.net/~wax/john_far.txt.html John Fare&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="steinberg"&gt;Shirley R. Steinberg, Priya Parmar, Birgit Richard - 2006  Contemporary Youth Culture: An International Encyclopedia: Volume 2 - Page 317&lt;/ref&gt;

In Craig's embellished and plagiarized version of Shein's original, John Charles Fare was born in 1936 in Toronto and attended [[Forest Hill College]]. In 1959 he moved to London to study architecture at the [[Bartlett School of Architecture]], but soon left to live in [[Copenhagen]]. He was briefly held in a mental health facility for exposing himself in public at performances. After his release, he was re-arrested for gluing objects to a car. The car's owner, musician and inventor Golni Czervath, did not press charges and befriended Fare. The two developed a robotic operating table with painter Gilbert Andoff. The first performance was a lobotomy on Fare in June 1964. All performances were performed on a Friday.  By the time Fare performed at the Isaacs Gallery in Toronto on 17 September 1968, he "was short one thumb, two fingers, eight toes, one eye, both testicles, and several random patches of skin." The amputated parts were preserved in alcohol. That evening, he had his right hand amputated. Fare's body was fitted with small microphones, which transmitted his pulse and breathing frequency in a distorted fashion. Craig said Fare had performed six more shows between 1968 and 1972.

In 1985 [[Danny Devos]] wrote to Isaacs Gallery founder [[Avrom Isaacs]] enquiring about John Fare and his supposed performance in 1968. The response included a statement in writing that the story of John Fare "has no factual basis," adding "there was no such person as John Fare as far as I know."&lt;ref name="isaacs1985"&gt;Isaacs, Av (February 15, 1985) [http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6816/3140/1600/john_fare_letter.jpg Personal correspondence].

==Response==

The story was reprinted in a [[fanzine]] made in collaboration with the band [[Coil (band)|Coil]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="tool" /&gt; That publication included more correspondence with Isaacs, who said, "I know of no such person as John Fare. In the sixties I had a series of mixed media concerts in my gallery, and out of this came the myth of John Fare. Every five years or so, someone rediscovers the myth and writes me a letter such as yours."&lt;ref name="tool" /&gt; Fare's alleged performance was emulated during a [[Nocturnal Emissions]] concert in London in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Noctunrnal Emissions (2005). [http://www.earthlydelights.co.uk/discog/johnfare.htm NIGEL AYERS / ANDREW LILES Four Compositions. Created for an imaginary performance by the legendary John Fare.] Pipkin CDR (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the event, a British music journalist recounts: "Fare cuts an eccentric figure. He wears trousers made from zips and has a diagram of a brain tattooed onto his shaven scalp. The performance artist placed his left hand on a chopping board with the fingers spread. Fare’s assistant, Jill Orr, is partially sighted and she slammed an axe between her boyfriend’s pinkies with increasing speed. Eventually the axe severed Fare’s little finger. This was the end of the performance art element within the evening’s entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Home in ''D&gt;Tour'' magazine, December 1997.  Cf.

'''Lianne Audrey Dalziel''' ({{IPAc-en|d|æ|l|ˈ|z|ɛ|l}}; born 7 June 1960) is the [[Mayor of Christchurch]]. Prior to this position, she was a member of the [[New Zealand Parliament]] for 23 years, serving as Minister of Immigration, Commerce, Minister of Food Safety and Associate Minister of Justice in the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]].&lt;ref name="reshuffleOct07"&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=New Zealand Government |date=31 October 2007 |title=Ministerial List for Announcement on 31 October 2007 |url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/Documents/Files/Ministerial%20List.DOC |format=DOC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001195125/http://www.beehive.govt.nz/Documents/Files/Ministerial%20List.DOC |archivedate=1 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She resigned from [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] on 20 February 2004 after apparently lying about a [[leak]] of documents to the media, but was reinstated as a Minister following [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]'s return to office after the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 election]]. She resigned from Parliament effective 11 October 2013 to contest the [[Christchurch mayoral election, 2013|Christchurch mayoral election]].

Dalziel entered Parliament as a [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] MP for [[Christchurch Central]] in [[New Zealand general election, 1990|1990]], replacing outgoing former Prime Minister [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]].&lt;ref name="Point of Principle" /&gt; She held this seat until the [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996 election]] (being replaced by [[Tim Barnett (politician)|Tim Barnett]]), when she became a list MP under the new [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] electoral system. In the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 election]], she chose to contest an electorate again, and won the [[Christchurch East]] seat. She held the seat in the 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2011 elections. In 2011 she opted not to go on the Labour list.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine picked her as a future leader in its December 1994 edition.&lt;ref name="Point of Principle" /&gt;

=== Cabinet minister ===
In the new government formed by [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]], Dalziel became Minister of Immigration, Minister for Senior Citizens, and Minister for Disability Issues. When Labour won re-election in the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 election]], Dalziel also became Minister of Commerce (while ceasing to be Minister for Disability Issues). In 2003, she ceased to be Minister for Senior Citizens. As Minister of Immigration, Dalziel was often in the spotlight. In particular, she often clashed with [[Winston Peters]], leader of the anti-immigration [[New Zealand First]] party.

After the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 election]], Dalziel was re-elected by her caucus colleagues to [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] and was given the portfolios of Commerce, Small Business, and Women's Affairs.

[[Mike Williams (New Zealand politician)|Mike Williams]], President of the Labour Party from 2000 to 2009, states that he was surprised by Clark appointing Dalziel Minister of Commerce and thought of it as an "odd choice". But she worked herself into the portfolio, paid attention to detail, and within a year had "proved herself". Williams believes this is due to her high intelligence and her ability to listen.&lt;ref name="Point of Principle" /&gt; [[Tim Barnett (politician)|Tim Barnett]], MP for [[Christchurch Central]] from 1996 to 2008, and today General Secretary of the Labour Party (equivalent to [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]), credits her training as a lawyer and "having a bigger brain than most of us" for her success.&lt;ref name="Point of Principle" /&gt; Williams states that as Minister of Commerce, Dalziel worked closely with National's [[Simon Power]] and built "cross-party unity on various issues".&lt;ref name="Point of Principle" /&gt;

=== Controversies ===
Dalziel's position became difficult after she was accused of giving certain documents to the press to bolster the case for a decision her Associate Minister had made. The decision, concerning the deportation of a [[Sri Lanka]]n teenager who was seeking asylum but who had originally lied about the reasons, was controversial, and Dalziel leaked the notes of the teenager's lawyer to [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]], attempting to discredit the teenager's case for asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dalziel loses job over leak |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/content/256921/2591754/article.html |accessdate=20 April 2013 |newspaper=TVNZ |date=20 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dalziel tried to avoid admitting to being the source of the documents, but was forced to admit that the leak had been at her direction. There was also significant controversy about how Dalziel had obtained the documents in the first place. Dalziel offered her resignation which Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] accepted.

=== Opposition and mayoral ambitions===
After Labour was defeated in the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008 general election]], Dalziel became the Opposition spokesperson on Justice and Commerce and, from [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011]], the spokesperson for the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|Christchurch Earthquake Recovery]], Civil Defence &amp; Emergence Management, Consumer Rights &amp; Standards, and associate spokesperson for Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lianne Dalziel |url= http://www.labour.org.nz/liannedalziel |accessdate=30 September 2013 |publisher=[[New Zealand Labour Party]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumours of Dalziel standing as [[Mayor of Christchurch]] go back to at least 2009.&lt;ref name="Point of Principle"&gt;{{cite news |last=Matthews |first=Philip |title=A Point of Principle |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=21 September 2013 |pages=C1–C3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the February 2011 earthquake, the rumours that Dalziel would contest the [[Christchurch mayoral election, 2013|2013 Christchurch mayoralty]] became more consistent. In May 2012, Dalziel tried to put an end to these rumours by announcing: "The job I really want is [[Gerry Brownlee]]'s, rather than [[Bob Parker (mayor)|Bob Parker]]'s."&lt;ref name="Brownlee's job"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gorman |first=Paul |title=Dalziel won't run for mayor |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/6908427/Dalziel-won-t-run-for-mayor |accessdate=26 August 2012 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brownlee is Earthquake Recovery Minister, and Parker was the [[Mayor of Christchurch]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Brownlee's job" /&gt; In the February 2013 reshuffle of opposition portfolios, Dalziel dropped out of the top 20 (only the first 20 positions are ranked by the Labour Party).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vance |first=Andrea |title=Dalziel dropped from Labour's top 20 |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8348590/Dalziel-dropped-from-Labours-top-20 |accessdate=3 March 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An editorial in ''[[The Press]]'' presumed that her strong support for [[David Cunliffe]] was part of the reason for her demotion. The editorial also speculated that she might reconsider her political future:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Labour's new faces |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/editorials/8350124/Editorial-Labours-new-faces |accessdate=3 March 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=26 February 2013 |page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The demotion is bound to concentrate Dalziel's mind on whether she should run for the [[Mayor of Christchurch|Christchurch mayoralty]]. As things stand, a place for her in a Labour cabinet as minister for the earthquake recovery looks unlikely, but she would be a strong candidate for mayor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following months of speculation, ''The Press'' reported on 20 April 2013 that Lianne Dalziel would challenge Parker for the mayoralty, and that she had asked 24-year-old Student Volunteer Army organiser [[Sam Johnson (activist)|Sam Johnson]] to be her running mate, with a view of Johnson becoming deputy mayor. The newspaper expressed surprise by this pairing, given that Dalziel was a Labour Party member, and Johnson a member of the [[New Zealand Young Nationals|Young Nats]], the youth arm of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dalziel invites Johnson to join mayoral race |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8574677/Dalziel-seeks-running-mate-in-mayoral-race |accessdate=20 April 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=20 April 2013 |location=[[Christchurch]] |page=A1&lt;!-- Note that the online version of this article is somewhat different --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saying that: "It was a really difficult decision to make, but I don't think it is the right thing for me right now", Johnson eventually decided against running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Student-Army-head-wont-run-for-mayor/tabid/423/articleID/295115/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title= Student Army head won't run for mayor| date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June, Dalziel formally confirmed that she would contest the mayoralty, also announcing that she would resign from Parliament, which would trigger a [[Christchurch East by-election, 2013|by-election in the Christchurch East electorate]].&lt;ref name=Heavyweights&gt;{{cite news |last=Cairns |first=Lois |title=Heavyweights fight for city |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8811913/Heavyweights-fight-for-City |accessdate=19 June 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=19 June 2013 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enters mayoralty race"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cairns |first=Lois |title=Dalziel formally enters mayoralty race |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/local-elections-2013/8940226/Dalziel-formally-enters-mayoralty-race |accessdate=26 August 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalziel delivered her resignation letter on 17 September and delivered her valedictory speech the following day with her resignation taking effect on Friday, 11 October; the day before the [[New Zealand local elections, 2013|local body election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Conway |first=Glenn |title=Dalziel officially resigns from Parliament  |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/local-elections-2013/9175441/Dalziel-officially-resigns-from-Parliament |accessdate=17 September 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=17 September 2013 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that the by-election campaign did not interfere with the local body election.&lt;ref name="enters mayoralty race" /&gt; In a later interview, Dalziel confirmed that she would have left Parliament even if Shearer had put her onto the [[Frontbench team of David Shearer|front bench]].&lt;ref name="Point of Principle" /&gt;

Although some expressed concerns about Dalziel's Labour Party background, including [[Christchurch Central City|central city]] property developer [[Antony Gough]], who talked of her "red apron strings" getting in the way of working with local business owners,&lt;ref name="Point of Principle" /&gt; she also nevertheless open support from the political right for her mayoral ambitions:&lt;ref name="Point of Principle" /&gt; [[Christchurch City Council]]lor Tim Carter, son of Christchurch property developer Philip Carter and nephew of [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[David Carter (politician)|David Carter]], encouraged her to stand for the mayoralty;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cairns |first=Lois |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8593994/Tim-Carter-out-backs-Lianne-Dalziel |title=Carter out, backs Dalziel&lt;!-- this is the title in the printed version; the online title is slightly longer --&gt; |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=25 April 2013 |location=[[Christchurch]] |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; former [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] cabinet minister [[Philip Burdon]] was one of her nominees when she lodged her nomination for the mayoralty with the returning officer;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cairns |first=Lois |title=Dalziel formally enters mayoralty race |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/local-elections-2013/8940226/Dalziel-formally-enters-mayoralty-race |accessdate=30 September 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and blogger [[Cameron Slater]], by many considered a "conduit for factions of the National Party"&lt;ref name="Point of Principle" /&gt; wrote:&lt;ref name="Point of Principle" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Cameron Slater |last=Slater |first=Cameron |title=Onya Lianne |url= http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2013/06/onya-lianne/#axzz2gOzc0pIC |publisher=Whale Oil Beef Hooked |accessdate=30 September 2013 |date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christchurch needs a uniter, not a divider, and the word is that National would far rather deal with Lianne and the competent councillors she is bringing with her than Bob Parker.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dalziel's Earthquake Recovery portfolio in Labour's shadow cabinet was split and given to [[Ruth Dyson]] and [[Clayton Cosgrove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cairns |first=Lois |title=Two MPs to take over Dalziel's portfolio |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8907042/Two-MPs-to-take-over-Dalziels-portfolio |accessdate=23 August 2013 |newspaper=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article lists verifiable '''spaceflight-related accidents and incidents''' resulting in fatality or near-fatality during flight or training for manned space missions, and testing, assembly, preparation or flight of manned and unmanned spacecraft. Not included are accidents or incidents associated with [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) tests, unmanned space flights not resulting in fatality or serious injury, or [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] or [[Germany|German]] [[rocket-powered aircraft]] projects of [[World War II]]. Also not included are [[Lost cosmonauts|alleged unreported Soviet space accidents]], which are considered [[fringe theory|fringe theories]] by a majority of historians.

{{As of|2018}}, there have been 18 astronaut and cosmonaut fatalities during spaceflight.{{sfnp|Harwood|2005}}{{Sfnp|Musgrave, Larsen, Tommaso|2009|p=143}} Astronauts have also died while training for space missions, such as the [[Apollo 1]] launch pad fire which killed an entire crew of three. There have also been some non-astronaut fatalities during spaceflight-related activities.

==Astronaut fatalities==
:''(In the statistics below, "astronaut" is applied to all space travellers to avoid the use of "astronaut/cosmonaut".)''

===During spaceflight===
{{As of|2018|03}}, in-flight accidents have killed 18 astronauts, in four separate incidents.{{Sfnp|Musgrave, Larsen, Tommaso|2009|p=143}}

NASA astronauts who died on duty are memorialized at the [[Space Mirror Memorial]] at the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center#Visitor Complex|Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] in [[Merritt Island, Florida]].  Cosmonauts who died on duty under the [[Soviet Union]] were generally honored by burial at the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] in [[Moscow]]. No Soviet or Russian cosmonauts have died during spaceflight since 1971.

There have been a total of five fatal in-flight accidents, three of them flew above the [[Kármán line]], and one was intended to do so. In each case, the entire crew was killed.

||The Space Shuttle [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']] was destroyed 73 seconds after lift-off on [[STS-51-L]] at an altitude of {{convert|15|km|ft|sp=us}}. The investigation found that cold weather conditions caused an [[O-ring]] seal to fail, allowing hot gases from the shuttle [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster (SRB)]] to impinge on the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external propellant tank]] and booster strut.

* 1972 May 10 : ''T-38 jet, electrical malfunction, out of fuel, ejected'' : Astronaut Charles "Pete" Conrad ejected safely from his NASA T-38 jet near Bergstrom AFB, Austin, TX. He landed about 90 meters from the base operations building. An electrical malfunction that caused loss of instruments during severe weather was listed by the review board as a major factor in the accident. Conrad was on a flight from Dover, DE via Dobbins AFB, GA to Ellington AFB, Houston, TX. Due to bad weather, he was diverted first to Hobby Airport, Houston because Ellington AFB was below minimums for landing. While on final approach to Hobby Airport, in darkness, heavy rain and lightning, the T-38 generator failed, causing a loss of cockpit lighting and partial loss of navigation instruments. Conrad broke off the approach and tried to climb above the bad weather. The generator was brought back online along with cockpit lighting. Because of the electrical problems, he requested a diversion to an airport that was under visual flight rules. Controllers sent him toward Randolph AFB, San Antonio, TX. It soon became apparent the T-38 did not have enough fuel to reach Randolph AFB. Controllers then diverted him to Bergstrom AFB. The T-38 ran out of fuel as it reached Bergstron AFB. Conrad ejected at 1100 meters. The aircraft was destroyed. He was taken to the base hospital for a routine examination and returned to Houston later that night.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rFohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1IUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=astronaut%20conrad&amp;pg=3737,2252747 "Moon man's jet crashes"], ''Richland, WA - Tri-City Herald newspaper'', May 11, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/83124main_1972.pdf "NASA Manned Spacecraft Center - 1972 Press Releases "], ''Release No: 72-98

'''Matthew 27:60''' is the sixtieth verse of the twenty-seventh chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]]. This verse describes the [[Entombment of Jesus]] by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] after the [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]].

The original [[Koine Greek]], according to [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]], reads:
:και εθηκεν αυτο εν τω καινω αυτου μνημειω ο ελατομησεν εν τη 
:πετρα και προσκυλισας λιθον μεγαν τη θυρα του μνημειου απηλθεν

In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible it is translated as:
:And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and 
:he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.

The modern [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, 
:and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed. 

For a collection of other versions see [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=27:60&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 27:60]

Joseph of Arimathea places Jesus in his own new tomb, a sign of great loyalty by Joseph. This verse is based on [[Mark 15:46]], and is paralleled by [[Luke 23:53]] and [[John 19:41]]. Matthew is the only gospel writer to mention that it was Joseph's own tomb that Jesus was placed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert H. Gundry|Gundry, Robert H.]] ''Matthew a Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art.'' Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982. pg. 581&lt;/ref&gt; Typically wealthy residents of Jerusalem would have a large family tomb, with space for many burials. The new tomb implies that no one has yet been entombed there, something made explicit in both Luke and John. Mentioning the newness, and emptiness, of the tomb may also be part of the body of evidence Matthew presents for the truth of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. A new tomb with only one body would prevent any confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. T. France|France, R.T.]]. ''The Gospel of Matthew.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007 pg. 1090&lt;/ref&gt; Davies and Allison note that reference to the newness of the tomb might also be an allusion to the newness that emerges from it with the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W.D. and Dale C. Allison, Jr. ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew''. Edinburgh : T. &amp; T. Clark, 1988-1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The newness of the tomb may also reflect that Joseph's wealth is new found, or that his family is newly arrived in Jerusalem. This could explain why he has a tomb in Jerusalem rather than his native Arimathea.&lt;ref&gt;Keener, Craig S. ''The Gospel of Matthew: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2009. pg. 694&lt;/ref&gt;

The description of the rock hewn tomb is fully in keeping with archeological evidence from the period. [[Jerusalem]] was surrounded by soft limestone rock that was perforated by natural and artificial caves, creating a giant natural cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Daniel J. ''The Gospel of Matthew.'' Liturgical Press, 1991 pg. 405&lt;/ref&gt; The door also matches examples from this period. Most tombs would have a smaller stone able to keep out animals. More expensive tombs would have a stone large enough to keep out grave robbers. This and other verses make clear that a larger stone is in place.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W.D. and Dale C. Allison, Jr. ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew''. Edinburgh : T.&amp; T. Clark, 1988-1997.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Joseph departs, not to be seen again in Matthew's narrative. Davies and Allison note that Matthew frequently treats his minor characters in this manner, giving no unnecessary details.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W.D. and Dale C. Allison, Jr. ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew''. Edinburgh : T. &amp; T. Clark, 1988-1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph leaving is in the next verses contrasted with the women who remain and the guards who later arrive.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. T. France|France, R.T.]]. ''The Gospel of Matthew.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007 pg. 1090&lt;/ref&gt; His departure is not mentioned in any of the other gospels, but Matthew adds the story of the guards arriving, so that could explain adding a mention of Joseph leaving.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert H. Gundry|Gundry, Robert H.]] ''Matthew a Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art.'' Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982. pg. 582&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and official line-up ==
Originally, it was supposed to be a Brazilian version of the famous German [[Wacken Open Air]].&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; However, the promoters failed to obtain official permission to use the name, so they decided to switch it for Metal Open Air.&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; From that moment on, several bands, including [[Shaman (Brazilian band)|Shaman]], [[Megadeth]], [[Symphony X]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]],&lt;ref name="vírgula"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sem shows nem estrutura, Metal Open Air é cancelado|url=http://virgula.uol.com.br/ver/noticia/festivais-de-musica/2012/04/21/298723-sem-shows-nem-estrutura-metal-open-air-e-cancelado|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=[[Universo Online|Vírgula]]|date=21 April 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; started to confirm their performances, though a few have cancelled, including [[Shadowside]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salzano Jr|first=Costábile|title=Metal Open Air: Shadowside cancela participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_842/147389-krisiun.html|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=3 February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krisiun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: Krisiun cancela sua participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_840/152194-metalopenair.html|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=12 April 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Volbeat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: Volbeat cancela sua participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_843/146543-metalopenair.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=23 January 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly for logistical reasons.

By February/March 2012, the official announced line-up was as follows (act names in '''bold''' are headliners; El Diablo is an entertainment group that prepared rock night parties after every headliner performance):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: anunciada a programação oficial do evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_842/148537-metalopenair.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=17 February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The festival and the cancellations ==
[[File:Symphony x 2004.tiff|thumb|right|220px|[[Michael Romeo]] (left) and [[Russell Allen]] (right); Symphony X was among the very few bands that managed to make a performance at the festival.]]

Shortly before and even during the festival, several bands cancelled their performances. British thrash band Venom, for example, had their [[Visa (document)|visas]] sent to Africa instead of Brazil by mistake,&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; thus making it impossible for them to take part of MOA and two other South American festivals. [[Hansi Kürsch]], vocalist for German power metal quartet Blind Guardian, stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Open Air 2012 performance cancelled|url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/2012/04/21/metal-open-air-2012-performance-cancelled/|publisher=Official Blind Guardian website|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|date=21 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''In 25 years of our career we [...] have been extremely successful in the avoidance of cancelled shows, so far. This unfortunately comes to a very sad end here in São Luís. Due to massive technical and administrative problems we were forced to cancel tonight's show. As far as we understand it seems to be the local management who has not been able to secure a proper festival environment, anymore. Things are pretty out of hand there. We feel very sorry about this totally unsatisfying situation, but the mistakes made by the local promoter makes an even improvised show impossible. [...] In the future we will be more careful in confirming such festivals.''}}

[[Aquiles Priester]], from Hangar, also cancelled his band's participation, stating:&lt;ref name=exame/&gt;

{{cquote|''We negotiated everything via oral conversation, but we made ourselves very much clear that we needed the total cash before our performance, since we needed to pay our trip to São Luís in our very own bus. We wouldn't accept, by any means, to play without our backline. So far, we were paid with only 25% of the cash to cover all our expenses (fuel, accommodation and food for the band and crew), we needed at least 75%.''}}

Terra Prima's members didn't receive their air tickets to São Luís nor the confirmation of their accommodations in the city.&lt;ref name=exame/&gt;

Symphony X, one of the few bands that managed to take on the stage and perform, posted a note some days later, thanking their fans for the show and criticizing the event's structure:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Open Air|url=http://www.symphonyx.com/site/news/metal-open-air/|publisher=Official Symphony X website|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''We want to thank the fans for sticking it out on Friday night! We were extremely close to having to cancel the show due to technical reasons and did not know if we would even play for sure until an hour before the set, which had already been delayed two hours. The lack of organization and chaos surrounding the event, which had also been noted by the media, had forced many bands to cancel. This is unfair to the fans in attendance, and unfortunately these fans were robbed of many performances.''}}

[[Dave Mustaine]], from Megadeth, also thanked his fans and regretted the festival's organization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Megadeth Mainman On Brazil's METAL OPEN AIR: 'We Were Playing For The People'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=172916|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''To the fans last night in São Luís, thank you. It's all I can say. One Big Mega Thank You! Yesterday's show in Sao Luis was very challenging, but we did it! [...] I was told a lot of the talent opted out from coming. I was also told the tickets cost $450 [[Brazilian real]] for the three-day weekend, and $250 BRL for just one day. The average person in this area makes $28 BRL a day, so you can do the math. [...] We were playing, no matter what. We weren't playing for the promoter anymore; we were playing for the people!''}}

[[Ricardo Confessori]], drummer for [[Shaman]], publicly contested Anthrax guitarist [[Scott Ian]] for canceling the band's performance at the festival, accusing him of not giving a good excuse for  the fans, to which Ian replied that the problem was "the whole terrible organization. We never want to cancel but they made it impossible."&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Scott_Ian/status/193877446603448320 Confessori's and Ian's discussion] at [[Twitter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, a total of 30 of the 47 invited bands cancelled their performances due to the severe logistical, structural and financial problems regarding the festival.&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; As for the fans, some had to camp inside [[stable]]s, with almost no electricity, lack of places to buy food, beverage and hygiene products and only one public toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freire|first=Pedro Henrique|title=Estábulos para cavalos viram área de camping para o público|url=http://www.oimparcial.com.br/app/noticia/especiais/metal-open-air/2012/04/20/interna_metal,113830/estabulos-para-cavalos-viram-area-de-camping-para-o-publico.shtml|publisher=O Imparcial|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|language=Portuguese|date=20 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524014607/http://www.oimparcial.com.br/app/noticia/especiais/metal-open-air/2012/04/20/interna_metal,113830/estabulos-para-cavalos-viram-area-de-camping-para-o-publico.shtml#|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barbosa|first=Alex|title=

'''National Youth Day''' is celebrated in [[India]] on 12 January on the birthday of [[Swami Vivekananda]]. In 1984 the Government of India declared the day as the National Youth Day and since 1985 the event is celebrated in India every year.

== History ==
It was a great decision of Government of India taken in the year, 1984 to celebrate the birthday of great Swami Vivekananda i.e. 12th January as a National Youth Day every year. As the Government of India had quoted and realized that ' the philosophy of Swamiji and the ideals for which he lived and worked could be a great source of inspiration for the Indian Youth.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Youth Day|url=http://www.belurmath.org/national_youth_day.htm|work=National Youth Day 12th January|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2013, Former Indian Prime  Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] told in his address at the inauguration of four-year-long celebrations of Swami Vivekananda's 150th birth anniversary— &lt;ref name="PM's address at the Inauguration of four Year Long Celebrations of Swami Vivekananda's 150th Birth Anniversary"&gt;{{cite web|title=PM's address at the Inauguration of four Year Long Celebrations of Swami Vivekananda's 150th Birth Anniversary |url=http://pmindia.gov.in/speech-details.php?nodeid=972 |publisher=Indian Government |accessdate=1 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816022843/http://pmindia.gov.in/speech-details.php?nodeid=972 |archivedate=16 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;What Gandhiji said captures the great importance of spreading Swami Vivekananda's ideas and ideals among the youth in our country today. He personified the eternal energy of the youth and their restless quest for truth. It is entirely fitting that the Government of India has declared 12th January, the birthday of Swami Vivekananda, as National Youth Day. We must work to rekindle the eternal message of this great patriot and son of India.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Celebration and activities ==

The National Youth Day is observed all over India at schools and colleges, with processions, speeches, recitations, music, youth conventions, seminars, Yogasanas, presentations, competitions in essay-writing, recitations and sports on 12 January every year. Swami Vivekananda's lectures and writings, deriving their inspiration from Indian spiritual tradition and the broad outlook of his Master Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa, are the source of inspiration and have motivated numerous youth organizations, study circles and service projects involving the youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Youth Day, India|url=http://india.gov.in/allimpfrms/alldocs/2539.pdf|work=National Youth Day|accessdate=6 October 2011|date=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7621">'''Newborn care and safety''' are the activities and precautions recommended for new parents or caregivers. It is also an educational goal of many hospital and birthing centers when it's time to bring their [[infant]] home.&lt;ref name = NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/childbirth-and-beyond/newborn-care-and-safety|title=Newborn care and safety - womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newborn care==
Taking a newborn care class during [[pregnancy]] can prepare caregivers for the real thing. But feeding and [[diaper]]ing a baby doll isn't quite the same. During the stay in a hospital or birthing center, clinicians and nurses help with basic baby care. These health providers will demonstrate basic infant care. Newborn care basics include:

* Handling a newborn, including supporting the baby's neck
* Changing diapers
* Bathing
* Dressing
* Swaddling 
* Feeding and burping 
* Cleaning the umbilical cord
* Caring for a healing circumcision
* Using a bulb syringe to clear the baby's nasal passages
* Taking a newborn's temperature
* Tips for soothing the baby&lt;ref name = NIH2017/&gt;

Before leaving the hospital, ask about home visits by a nurse or health care worker. Many new parents appreciate somebody checking in with them and their baby a few days after coming home. If  breastfeeding,  a mother can ask whether a lactation consultant visit in the home to provide follow-up support, as well as providing other resources in the community, such as peer support groups.&lt;ref name = NIH2017/&gt;

Many first-time parents also welcome the help of a family member or friend who has "been there." Having a support person stay with the newborn for a few days can give the mother the confidence to go at it alone in the weeks ahead. This can be to arranged before delivery.&lt;ref name = NIH2017/&gt;

The baby's first doctor's visit is another good time to ask about any infant care questions. Parents can ask about reasons to call the doctor and about what vaccines  baby needs and when. Young children need vaccines because the diseases they protect against can strike at an early age and can be very dangerous in childhood. This includes rare diseases and more common ones, such as the flu.&lt;ref name = NIH2017/&gt;

Caring for a newborn also includes the health screening of the newborn, most of the times this occurs in the hospital or pediatrician's office shortly after birth. Every state screens babies for more than two dozen disorders. Early detection can help treat the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2c.cdc.gov/podcasts/player.asp?f=8629632&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safe nutrition==
{{Main|Infant food safety}}
Handwashing helps to prevent the spread of foodborne illnesses to children. Pathogenic microorganisms can be transmitted from other children and their [[diapers]], and from uncooked meat, [[seafood]], [[poultry egg|eggs]], dogs, [[feline zoonosis|cats]], [[turtles]], [[snakes]], [[birds]], [[lizards]], and soil.&lt;ref name = FDA2017&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/HealthEducators/ucm089629.htm|title=Health Educators - Food Safety for Moms to Be: Once Baby Arrives|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|last=Nutrition|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=25 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sudden infant death syndrome==
{{Main | Sudden infant death syndrome}}

Since 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that infants be placed to sleep on their backs to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also called crib death. SIDS is the sudden and unexplained death of a baby under 1 year of age. Even though there is no way to know which babies might die of SIDS, recommendations include:

* Always place the baby on his or her back to sleep, even for naps. This is the safest sleep position for a healthy baby to reduce the risk of SIDS.
* Place the baby on a firm mattress, such as in a safety-approved crib. Research has shown that placing a baby to sleep on soft mattresses, sofas, sofa cushions, waterbeds, sheepskins, or other soft surfaces raises the risk of SIDS.
* Remove soft, fluffy, and loose bedding and stuffed toys from the baby's sleep area. Make sure all pillows, quilts, stuffed toys, and other soft items are kept away from the baby's sleep area.
* Do not use infant sleep positioners. Using a positioner to hold an infant on his or her back or side for sleep is dangerous and not needed.
* Make sure everyone who cares for the baby knows to place the baby on his or her back to sleep and about the dangers of soft bedding. Talk to child care providers, grandparents, babysitters, and all caregivers about SIDS risk. Remember, every sleep time counts.
* Make sure the baby's face and head stay uncovered during sleep. Keep blankets and other coverings away from the baby's mouth and nose. The best way to do this is to dress the baby in sleep clothing so there will not have to use any other covering over the baby. If using a blanket or another covering, make sure that the baby's feet are at the bottom of the crib, the blanket is no higher than the baby's chest, and the blanket is tucked in around the bottom of the crib mattress.
* Do not allow smoking around the baby. Don't smoke before or after the birth of the baby and make sure no one smokes around the baby.
* Don't let the baby get too warm during sleep. Keep the baby warm during sleep, but not too warm. The baby's room should be at a temperature that is comfortable for an adult. Too many layers of clothing or blankets can overheat the baby.&lt;ref name = NIH2017/&gt;
Some mothers worry if the baby rolls over during the night. However, by the time the baby is able to roll over by herself, the risk for SIDS is much lower. During the time of greatest risk, 2 to 4 months of age, most babies are not able to turn over from their backs to their stomachs.&lt;ref name = NIH2017/&gt;

==Car seats==
{{Main | Child safety seat}}
[[File:Rear facing car seat image from the CDC.png|thumb |100px|Rear facing car seat]]
Newborns and older infants are to use rear-facing car seats. These are required until age 2 or when they reach the upper weight or height limit of that seat. After this, a forward-facing car seat is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/features/passengersafety/ingofraphic.html|title=CDC Features - Child Passenger Safety|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=26 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death for children in the US. Buckling up is the best way to save lives and reduce injuries. Child passenger restraint laws result in more children being buckled up. Only 2 out of every 100 children live in states that require car seat or booster seat use for newborns and infants. A third of children who died in crashes in 2011 were not buckled up. Caregivers promote the safety their newborns by: Knowing how to use car seats, booster seats, and seat belts and using them on every trip, no matter how short.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/childpassengersafety/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rupert Murdoch - WEF Davos 2007.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Rupert Murdoch]], chairman and chief executive officer of [[News Corporation]], the parent company of [[News International]]]]
The '''News International phone-hacking scandal''' was a controversy involving the now defunct ''[[News of the World]]'' and other British newspapers published by [[News International]], a subsidiary of [[News Corporation]]. Employees of the newspaper were accused of engaging in [[phone hacking]], police bribery, and exercising improper influence in the pursuit of stories. Whilst investigations conducted from 2005 to 2007 appeared to show that the paper's phone hacking activities were limited to celebrities, politicians, and members of the [[British Royal Family]], in July 2011 it was revealed that the phones of murdered schoolgirl [[Murder of Milly Dowler|Milly Dowler]], relatives of deceased British soldiers, and victims of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] had also been hacked. The resulting public outcry against News Corporation and its owner [[Rupert Murdoch]] led to several high-profile resignations, including that of Murdoch as News Corporation director, Murdoch's son [[James Murdoch|James]] as executive chairman, [[Dow Jones]] chief executive [[Les Hinton]], News International legal manager [[Tom Crone]], and chief executive [[Rebekah Brooks]]. The [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|commissioner]] of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]] (MPS), [[Paul Stephenson (police officer)|Sir Paul Stephenson]], also resigned. Advertiser boycotts led to the closure of the ''News of the World'' on 10 July 2011, after 168 years of publication.&lt;ref name=bbctimeline&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14124020 |title=Phone-hacking scandal: Timeline |publisher=BBC News |date=12 July 2011 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public pressure shortly forced News Corporation to cancel its proposed takeover of the British satellite broadcaster [[BSkyB]].

The prime minister [[David Cameron]] announced on 6 July 2011 that a public inquiry, known as the [[Leveson Inquiry]], would look into phone hacking and police bribery by the ''News of the World'', consider the wider culture and ethics of the British newspaper industry and that the [[Press Complaints Commission]] would be replaced "entirely".&lt;ref name=bbctimeline/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8634757/Phone-hacking-David-Cameron-announces-terms-of-phone-hacking-inquiry.html|title=Phone hacking: David Cameron announces terms of phone-hacking inquiry|accessdate=13 July 2011|work=The Telegraph|date=13 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of arrests and convictions followed, most notably of the former ''News of the World'' managing editor [[Andy Coulson]].

Murdoch and his son, [[James Murdoch|James]], were summoned to give evidence at the [[Leveson Inquiry]].

By 2002, an organised trade in confidential personal information had developed in Britain and was widely used by the British newspaper industry.&lt;ref name=WhatPricePrivacy/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianRees20020921a&gt;{{cite news|last=McLagan|first=Graeme|title=Fraudster squad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/21/privacy2|accessdate=28 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illegal means of gaining information used included hacking the private voicemail accounts on mobile phones, hacking into computers, making false statements to officials, entrapment, blackmail, burglaries, theft of mobile phones and making payments to public officials.&lt;ref name=NYTimesMcMullan201111&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|title=British Inquiry Is Told Hacking Is Worthy Tool|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/world/europe/british-hacking-scandal-widens-to-government-secrets.html?pagewanted=all|date=29 November 2011|accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="channel4.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Undercover at the News of the World|newspaper=Channel 4|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/undercover-at-the-news-of-the-world/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1|date=2 August 2012|accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianFallon20120803&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Carroll|first=Lisa|title=Kieren Fallon says he felt suicidal over News of the World sting|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/03/kieren-fallon-suicidal-news-of-the-world-sting|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DaviesRees20110609&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Nick|title=The NoW’s merchant of secrets|url=http://www.nickdavies.net/2011/07/08/the-nows-merchant-of-secrets/|accessdate=19 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Somaiya"&gt;{{cite news|last=Somaiya|first=Ravi|title=Murdoch Inquiry Extends to Cellphone Theft|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/world/europe/murdoch-probe-extends-to-cellphone-theft.html?hp|date=23 July 2012|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Nigeria===
Private investigators who were illegally providing information to the ''News of the World'' were also engaged in a variety of other illegal activities. Between 1999 and 2003, [[List of persons arrested in phone-hacking scandal|several were convicted]] for crimes including drug distribution, the theft of drugs, child pornography, planting evidence, corruption, and perverting the course of justice. [[Jonathan Rees]] and his partner Sid Fillery, a former police officer, were also under suspicion for the murder of private investigator [[Daniel Morgan (private investigator)|Daniel Morgan]]. The MPS undertook an investigation of Rees, entitled [[Metropolitan Police role in the News International phone hacking scandal#Operation Nigeria (1999)|Operation Nigeria]], and tapped his telephone. Substantial evidence was accumulated that Rees was purchasing information from improper sources and that, amongst others, Alex Marunchak of the ''[[News of the World]]'' was paying him up to £150,000 a year for doing so.&lt;ref name=GuardianRees20110311/&gt; [[Jonathan Rees]] reportedly bought information from former and serving police officers, Customs officers, a VAT inspector, bank employees, burglars, and from blaggers who would telephone the Inland Revenue, the [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency|DVLA]], banks and phone companies, and deceive them into releasing confidential information.&lt;ref name=DaviesRees20110609/&gt; Rees then sold the information to the ''[[News of the World]]'', the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' and the ''[[Sunday Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Sam|title=Blagging – the dark art of the men Gordon Brown calls 'known criminals'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/12/blagging-dark-art-gordon-brown|accessdate=18 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Operation Nigeria bugging ended in September 1999 and Rees was arrested when he was heard planning to plant drugs on a woman so that her husband could win custody of their child.&lt;ref name=GuardianRees20110311/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianRees20020921b&gt;{{cite news|last=McLagan|first=Graeme|title=Journalists caught on tape in police bugging|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/21/privacy|accessdate=29 August 2011|newspaper=The Guaradian|date=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rees was convicted in 2000 and served a five-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name=GuardianRees20110311&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Nick|title=Jonathan Rees: private investigator who ran empire of tabloid corruption|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/11/jonathan-rees-private-investigator-tabloid|accessdate=18 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianRees20110608&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/08/phone-hacking-scandal-jonathan-rees |title=Phone-hacking scandal: Jonathan Rees obtained information using dark arts |author=Davies, Nick |work=The Guardian |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other individuals associated with Rees who were taped during Operation Nigeria, including Detective Constable Austin Warnes, former detective Duncan Hanrahan, former Detective Constable Martin King and former Detective Constable Tom Kingston, were prosecuted and jailed for various offences unrelated to phone hacking.&lt;ref name=GuardianRees20110311/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianRees20020921b/&gt;&lt;ref name="HackAttack"/&gt;

In June 2002, Fillery had reportedly used his relationship with Alex Marunchak to arrange for private investigator [[Glenn Mulcaire]], then doing work for ''News of the World'', to obtain confidential information about Detective Chief Superintendent David Cook, one of the police officers investigating the murder of [[Daniel Morgan (private investigator)|Daniel Morgan]]. Mulcaire obtained Cook's home address, his internal Metropolitan police payroll number, his date of birth and figures for his mortgage payments as well as physically following him and his family. Attempts to access Cook's voicemail and that of his wife, and possibly hack his computer and intercept his post were also suspected.&lt;ref name=GuardianCook20110706/&gt; Documents reportedly held by Scotland Yard show that "Mulcaire did this on the instructions of [[Greg Miskiw]], assistant editor at ''News of the World'' and a close friend of Marunchak." The Metropolitan Police Service handled this apparent attempt by agents of the ''News of the World'' to interfere with a murder inquiry by having informal discussions with [[Rebekah Brooks]], then editor for the newspaper. "Scotland Yard took no further action, apparently reflecting the desire of Dick Fedorcio, Director of Public Affairs and Internal Communication for the Met who had a close working relationship with Brooks, to avoid unnecessary friction with the newspaper."&lt;ref name=GuardianCook20110706/&gt;

No one was charged with illegal acquisition of confidential information as a result of Operation Nigeria, even though the Met reportedly collected hundreds of thousands of incriminating documents during the investigation into Jonathan Rees and his links with corrupt officers.&lt;ref name="GuardianRees20110608xy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Nick|title=Phone-hacking scandal widens to include Kate Middleton and Tony Blair|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jun/08/phone-hacking-kate-middleton-tony-blair|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodd, Vikram and Sandra Laville"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dodd, Vikram  |author2=Sandra Laville |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Scotland Yard in spotlight as axe murder case collapses|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/11/scotland-yard-murder-case-daniel-morgan|accessdate=26 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fillery was convicted for child pornography offences in 2003.&lt;ref name=GuardianRees20110608/&gt; Upon Rees' release from prison in 2005, he immediately resumed his investigative work for the ''News of the World'', where [[Andy Coulson]] had succeeded Rebekah Brooks as editor.

===Operation Motorman===
In 2002, under the title [[Operation Motorman (ICO investigation)|Operation Motorman]], the [[Information Commissioner's Office]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ico.gov.uk/ |title=Information Commissioner's Office |work=Information Commissioner's Office Website |publisher=Information Commissioner's Office |accessdate=23 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920050609/http://www.ico.gov.uk/ |archivedate=20 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; raided the offices of various newspaper and private investigators, looking for details of personal information kept on unregistered computer databases. The operation uncovered numerous invoices addressed to newspapers and magazines, which detailed prices for the provision of personal information. 305 journalists, working for at least 30 publications, were identified as purchasing confidential information from private investigators.&lt;ref name=WhatPricePrivacy&gt;{{cite web|title=What Price Privacy?|url=http://www.ico.gov.uk/~/media/documents/library/Corporate/Research_and_reports/WHAT_PRICE_PRIVACY.ashx|publisher=Information Commissioner's Office|date=10 May 2006|accessdate=20 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829133733/http://www.ico.gov.uk/~/media/documents/library/Corporate/Research_and_reports/WHAT_PRICE_PRIVACY.ashx|archivedate=29 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PG36439/&gt; The ICO raided a private investigator named John Boyall, whose specialty was acquiring information from confidential databases.

"Media, especially newspapers, insurance companies and local authorities chasing council tax arrears all appear in the sales ledger" of the agency.&lt;ref name=WhatPricePrivacyNow/&gt;  Whittamore's network gave him access to confidential records at telephone companies, banks, post offices, hotels, theatres, and prisons, including [[BT Group]], [[Crédit Lyonnais]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Hang Seng Bank]], [[Glen Parva (HM Prison)|Glen Parva prison]], and [[Stocken (HM Prison)|Stocken prison]].&lt;ref name=GuardianMotorman20090830&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Nick|title=Operation Motorman: the full story revealed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/31/press-privacy-information-commmissioner|accessdate=21 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ICO issued two reports, "What price privacy?" in May 2006 and "What price privacy now?" in December 2006, much of the information obtained through Operation Motorman was not made public.&lt;ref name=WhatPricePrivacyNow/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background information from "What Price Privacy?" report|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/background_information_from_what|work=What Do They Know.com- Make and explore Freedom of Information requests|publisher=What Do They Know.com|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was evidence of many people being engaged in illegal activity, relatively few were questioned.

==2005–2006: Royal phone hacking scandal==
{{Main article|News of the World royal phone hacking scandal}}

On 14 November 2005, the ''[[News of the World]]'' published an article written by royal editor [[Clive Goodman]], claiming that [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] was in the process of borrowing a portable editing suite from [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] correspondent [[Tom Bradby]]. Following the publication, the Prince and Bradby met to try to figure out how the details of their arrangement had been leaked, as only two other people were aware of it. Prince William noted that another equally improbable leak had recently taken place regarding an appointment he had made with a knee surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-399814/Moment-Prince-William-discovered-voicemail-scam.html |title=Moment Prince William discovered 'voicemail scam' |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=9 August 2006 |accessdate=5 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince and Bradby concluded it was likely that their voicemails were being accessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Julia Day |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/aug/09/royalsandthemedia.themonarchy |title=Phone tap investigation widens |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 9 August 2006|accessdate=5 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metropolitan Police]] set up an investigation under Deputy Assistant Commissioner [[Peter Clarke (police officer)|Peter Clarke]] reporting to Assistant Commissioner [[Andy Hayman]], commander of the [[Specialist Operations]] directorate, which included royal protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/29/july7.duncancampbell|title=The Guardian profile: Peter Clarke|author=Campbell, Duncan | author2 = Cowan, Rosie|date=29 July 2005|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian040410&gt;Nick Davies.

In August 2006, Goodman and Mulcaire were arrested by the Metropolitan Police, and later charged with hacking the telephones of members of the royal family by accessing voicemail messages, an offence under section 79 of the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4778159.stm |title=Two charged in 'phone-tap' probe |publisher=BBC News |date=9 August 2006 |accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''News of the World'' had paid Mulcaire £104,988 for his services.

In March 2007, a senior aide to Rupert Murdoch told a parliamentary committee that a "rigorous internal investigation" found no evidence of widespread hacking at the ''News of the World''.

==PCC investigations==
The [[Press Complaints Commission]], PCC, is the organisation charged with self-regulation of the newspaper and magazine industry in Britain. The PCC's inquiry into phone hacking in 2007 concluded that the practice should stop but that "there is a legitimate place for the use of subterfuge when there are grounds in the public interest to use it and it is not possible to obtain information through other means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PCC Report on Subterfuge and Newsgathering|url=http://www.pcc.org.uk/assets/218/PCC_subterfuge_report.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2011|publisher=Press Complaints Commission|date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Preston|first=Peter|title=PCC editors failed to sound the phone-hacking alarm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/06/phone-hacking-press-complaints-commission-comment|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[News of the World]]'' editor [[Colin Myler]] told the PCC that Goodman's hacking was "aberrational", "a rogue exception" of a single journalist. The PCC opted not to question Andy Coulson on the grounds that he had left the industry, and not to question any other journalist or executive on the paper, apart from Myler, who had no knowledge of what had been going on there before his appointment.

In 2009 the PCC held another inquiry, to see whether they were misled by the ''[[News of the World]]'' in 2007, and if there was any evidence that phone hacking had taken place since then.

==2009–2011: Renewed investigations==
{{Main article|News of the World phone hacking scandal investigations}}
[[File:Trapped underground.jpg|thumb|It was reported that the ''News of the World'' may have hacked the phones of relatives of [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7/7 attack]] victims (survivors pictured aboard one of the bombed Underground trains)]]

After the 2006 conviction of [[Clive Goodman]] and [[Glenn Mulcaire]], and with assurances from ''[[News International]]'', the [[Press Complaints Commission]] and the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] that no one else had been involved in phone hacking, the public perception was that the matter was closed. [[Nick Davies]] and other journalists from ''The Guardian'', and eventually other newspapers, however continued to examine evidence from court cases and use [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] requests to find evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name=GuardianRusbridger20110717&gt;{{cite news | author =Rusbridger, Alan| title =How We Broke the Murdoch Scandal -Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger on his dogged reporter, a U.S Ally—and a gamble that finally paid off.| work =The Daily Beast| date =17 July 2011| url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/07/17/how-the-guardian-broke-the-news-of-the-world-hacking-scandal.html| accessdate =7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Correspondence Between The New York Times and Scotland Yard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/07/17/world/europe/20110717police-correspondence.html|accessdate=14 October 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Guardian'' July 2009 reports===
A small number of victims of phone hacking engaged solicitors and made civil claims for invasion of privacy. By March 2010, News International had spent over £2&amp;nbsp;million settling court cases with victims of phone hacking. As information about these claims leaked out, ''[[The Guardian]]'' continued to follow the story. On 8 &amp; 9 July 2009, the newspaper published three articles alleging that:
* [[News Group Newspapers]], NGN, a subsidiary of [[News International]], agreed to large settlements with hacking victims, including [[Gordon Taylor (footballer)|Gordon Taylor]]. The settlements included gagging provisions to prevent release of evidence that NGN journalists had used criminal methods to get stories. "News Group then persuaded the court to seal the file on Taylor's case to prevent all public access, even though it contained prima facie evidence of criminal activity."&lt;ref name=GuardianGag20090708&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Nick|title=Murdoch papers paid £1m to gag phone-hacking victims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/08/murdoch-papers-phone-hacking|accessdate=23 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That evidence included documents seized in raids by the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] as well as by the Met.&lt;ref name=GuardianCoulson20090708&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Nick|title=Trail of hacking and deceit under nose of Tory PR chief|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/08/murdoch-newspapers-phone-hacking|accessdate=23 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the suppressed evidence became public, hundreds more phone hacking victims might be able to take legal action against [[News International]] newspapers and might lead to police inquiries being re-opened.&lt;ref name=GuardianGag20090708/&gt;
* When [[Andy Coulson]] was editor of the ''[[News of the World]]'', journalists there openly engaged private investigators for illegal phone hacking and raised invoices that itemised illegal acts.&lt;ref name=GuardianCoulson20090708/&gt;
* Everybody at the ''News of the World'' knew what was going on and knew that there was no public interest defense for phone hacking. The way investigations had been pursued raised serious questions about the Metropolitan Police, the Crown Prosecution Service, and the courts which, "faced with evidence of conspiracy and systemic illegal actions,...agreed to seal the evidence." rather than make it public.&lt;ref name=GuardianNeil20090708&gt;{{cite news|last=Dodd|first=Vikram|title=Ex-Murdoch editor Andrew Neil: News of the World revelations one of most significant media stories of our time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/09/andrew-neil-murdoch-andy-coulson|accessdate=24 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Met held evidence that thousands of mobile phones had been hacked into by agents of the ''News of the World'' and that Members of Parliament, including cabinet ministers, were among the victims.&lt;ref name=GuardianGag20090708/&gt;
* "The Metropolitan Police took the decision not to inform all the individuals whose phones had been targeted and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] decided not to take News Group executives to court."&lt;ref name=GuardianCoulson20090708/&gt;
* News International executives had misled a Parliamentary select committee, the [[Press Complaints Commission]] and the public about the extent of their newspaper's illegal activities.&lt;ref name=GuardianGag20090708/&gt;

===Scotland Yard's response===
When the ''Guardian'' articles were published, [[Metropolitan Police Service]] Commissioner [[Paul Stephenson (police officer)|Sir Paul Stephenson]] asked Assistant Commissioner [[John Yates (police officer)|John Yates]] to look at the phone hacking case to see if it should be reopened. Yates reportedly took just eight hours to consult with senior detectives and Crown Prosecution lawyers to conclude there was no fresh material that could lead to further convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Cherry|title=John Yates expresses 'massive regret' over phone hacking investigation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jul/09/john-yates-massive-regret-phone-hacking-investigation|accessdate=23 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His review did not include an examination of the thousands of pages of evidence seized in the 2006 Mulcaire raid.&lt;ref name=TelegraphYates20110709&gt;{{cite news|author1=Alasdair Palmer  |author2=Robert Mendick |lastauthoramp=yes |title=John Yates: Phone hacking investigation was a 'cock up'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8627599/John-Yates-Phone-hacking-investigation-was-a-cock-up.html|accessdate=23 September 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, Yates maintained his position to the Commons [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] saying, "There remain now insufficient grounds or evidence to arrest or interview anyone else and...no additional evidence has come to light."&lt;ref name="ParliamentYates20110902"&gt;{{cite news|title=Examination of Witnesses (Question Numbers 1889–1899)-Assistant Commissioner John Yates and Detective Chief Superintendent Philip Williams|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmcumeds/362/9090214.htm|accessdate=27 August 2011|publisher=UK Parliament|date=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon review of the first inquiry, he concluded that there were "hundreds, not thousands" of potential victims."&lt;ref name=GuardianCorrupt20110707/&gt;  Yates told the Committee, "It is very few, it is a handful" of persons that had been subject to hacking.&lt;ref name=ParliamentYates20110902a/&gt; Although Yates was aware of the "Transcript for Neville" email that indicated more than a single rogue reporter was involved, he did not interview [[Neville Thurlbeck]] nor any other journalist at the ''News of the World'', nor look into the cases of victims beyond the eight named in court in 2006.&lt;ref name=ParliamentYates20110902a&gt;{{cite news|title=Examination of Witnesses (Question Numbers 1900–1919)-Assistant Commissioner John Yates and Detective Chief Superintendent Philip Williams|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmcumeds/362/9090215.htm|accessdate=27 August 2011|publisher=UK Parliament|date=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianYates20110127&gt;{{cite news|title=Phone hacking: Transcript of MPs questioning Met police in 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/27/transcript-mps-question-police-phone-hacking|accessdate=23 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee's findings, released in February 2010, were critical of the police for not pursuing "evidence that merited a wider investigation."&lt;ref name=NYTimesRoyals20100901/&gt;&lt;ref name=ParliamentCMSC20100209&gt;{{cite web|title=Press standards, privacy and libel- Second Report of Session 2009–10 Volume I Report, together with formal minutes|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/.../362/362i.pdf|work=Press standards, privacy and libel|publisher=UK Parliament- Culture, Media and Sport Committee|accessdate=15 October 2011|date=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee Chairman [[John Whittingdale]] also questioned whether the Committee had been misled by several of the News International executives who had testified before it in 2007 that Goodman alone was involved in phone hacking. The Committee again heard evidence from [[Les Hinton]], by then chief executive officer of [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]], and Andy Coulson, by then director of communications for the Conservative Party. Their report concluded that it was "inconceivable" that no one, other than Goodman, knew about the extent of phone hacking at the paper, and that the Committee had "repeatedly encountered an unwillingness to provide the detailed information that we sought, claims of ignorance or lack of recall and deliberate obfuscation".&lt;ref name=ParliamentCMSC20100209/&gt;

Assistant Commissioner Yates returned to the Committee on 24 March 2011 and defended his position that only ten to twelve victims met the criteria given to the police by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]]. The CPS denied that what they had told the Met could be reasonably used to limit the scope of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Nick|title=Phone hacking: Metropolitan police chief keeps up row with DPP|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/24/phone-hacking-metropolitan-police-dpp|accessdate=17 September 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, they claimed to have been misled by the Met during consultations on the Royal Household inquiry. Met officials reportedly "didn’t discuss certain evidence with senior prosecutors, including the notes suggesting the involvement of other reporters."&lt;ref name=NYTimesRoyals20100901/&gt;

The [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] also questioned Yates in 2009 about the Met's continuing refusal to reopen the investigation "following allegations that 27 other [[News International]] reporters had commissioned private investigators to carry out tasks, some of which might have been illegal." Yates responded that he had only looked into the facts of the original 2006 inquiry into Goodmans activities.&lt;ref name=RegisterTaylor20090715&gt;{{cite news|last=Leyden|first=John|title=MPs shown 'email evidence' of wider NotW snooping alert print tweet'One bad apple' defence wormed into|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/15/notw_hack_hearings/|accessdate=27 September 2011|newspaper=The Register|date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Home Affairs Committee began another inquiry on 1 September 2010 and later published a report highly critical of the Met, stating, "The difficulties were offered to us as justifying a failure to investigate further, and we saw nothing that suggested there was a real will to tackle and overcome those obstacles."

''The Guardian'' continued to be critical of Yates, who responded by hiring a firm of libel lawyers, paid for by the Met, to threaten legal action against anyone that claimed he had misled Parliament.&lt;ref name=GuardianRees20110311/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianYates20110825&gt;{{cite news|last=Laville|first=Sandra|title=Scotland Yard paid John Yates's legal bills|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/25/met-yates-legal-bills|accessdate=25 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, as celebrities and politicians continued asking if they had been victims of hacking, Yates directed that the evidence from the Mulcaire raid, that had been stored in bin bags for three years, finally be entered into a computer database. Ten people were assigned the task. Yates himself did not look at the evidence saying later, "I’m not going to go down and look at bin bags. I am supposed to be an Assistant Commissioner."&lt;ref name=TelegraphYates20110709/&gt;  He did not re-open the investigation.

Days after the settlement with Gordon Taylor was revealed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in July 2009, [[Max Clifford]], another of the eight victims named in 2006, announced his intentions to sue. In March 2010, [[News International]] agreed to settle his suit for £1,000,000, a much greater than expected settlement if hacking Clifford's phone was the only issue.&lt;ref name=GuardianClifford20100309&gt;{{cite news|author1=Nick Davies  |author2=Rob Evans |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Max Clifford drops News of the World phone hacking action in £1m deal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/09/clifford-news-of-the-world-phone-hacking|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These two awards encouraged other victims to explore legal redress, resulting in more and more phone hacking queries to the Metropolitan Police, which they were often slow to respond to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin Hickman|title=Charlotte Harris: Nowhere to hide, says the lawyer on Murdoch's case|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/charlotte-harris-nowhere-to-hide-says-the-lawyer-on-murdochs-case-2269242.html|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One commentator observed that "the Goodman-Mulcaire revelations and subsequent prosecution were supposed to have settled the hacking matter forever and might have done just that, except that successful law suits...  kept popping up against News of the World after the convictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefeministwire.com/2011/07/29/dial-m-for-murdoch-and-mayhem/ |title=Dial M for Murdoch and Mayhem |author=Spillers, Hortense |work=The Feminist Wire |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Guardian'' December 2010 report===
[[File:The Guardian Building Window in London.JPG|right|thumb|''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper was at the forefront of reporting on the phone hacking scandal.]]
On 15 December 2010, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that some of the documents seized from [[Glenn Mulcaire]] in 2006 by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] and only recently disclosed in open court, implied that ''[[News of the World]]'' editor [[Ian Edmondson]] specifically instructed Mulcaire to hack voice messages of [[Sienna Miller]], [[Jude Law]], and several others. The documents also implied that Mulcaire was engaged by ''News of the World'' chief reporter [[Neville Thurlbeck]] and assistant editor [[Greg Miskiw]], who had then worked directly for editor [[Andy Coulson]].&lt;ref name=GuardianMiller20101215/&gt; This contradicted  testimony to the [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] by News International executives and senior Met officials that there was no evidence of hacking by anyone other than Mulcaire and Goodman.

In June 2011, the issue of computer hacking was addressed with the launch of [[Operation Tuleta]].

Having failed thus far to put the phone hacking issue to rest,  [[News International]]'s law firm, Hickman &amp; Rose, hired former [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] [[Ken Macdonald]] to review the emails that News International executives had used as the basis of their claim that no one at the ''[[News of the World]]'' but [[Clive Goodman]] had been involved in phone hacking. Macdonald immediately concluded, regardless of whether others had been involved, that there was clear evidence of criminal activity, including payments to serving police officers. Macdonald arranged for this evidence to be turned over to the Met, which led to their opening in July 2011 of [[Operation Elveden]], an investigation focused on bribery and corruption within the Met's ranks.

The first arrests as part of Operation Weeting were made on 5 April 2011. Ian Edmondson and the ''News of the World''{{'s}} chief reporter [[Neville Thurlbeck]] were arrested on suspicion of unlawfully intercepting voicemail messages.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/09/world/europe/09hacking.html |work=The New York Times | first=Sarah | last=Lyall | title=British Tabloid Accepts Blame in Cell Hacking | date=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arrests"&gt;{{Cite news

===Apology and compensation===
[[News International]] announced on 8 April 2011 that it would admit liability in some of the [[breach of privacy]] cases being brought in relation to phone hacking by the ''News of the World''. The company offered an unreserved apology and compensation to eight claimants, but would continue to contest allegations made by other litigants.&lt;ref name="apology1"&gt;{{Cite news

Scottish politician [[Danny Alexander]] predicted further arrests would be made. The shadow [[Secretary of State for Wales]] [[Peter Hain]] called on the legal authorities to conduct a "full and proper public investigation" and then claimed the police investigation had been "tardy".&lt;ref name="kennedy1"/&gt;

In January 2012 it was reported that [[Respect Party|Respect]] politician [[George Galloway]], who was not an MP at the time, had settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Deans, Amelia Hill &amp; Lisa O'Carroll [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/19/phone-hacking-payment-victims "Phone hacking: News International to pay out to 37 victims"], theguardian.com, 19 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Galloway had begun legal proceedings for breach of privacy in 2010 after being told by the Met that he had probably been targeted by Mulcaire. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Former MP George Galloway 'offered payout over hacking' |work=BBC News | date =30 January 2011 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12319722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galloway said the apology was a cynical attempt to protect Rebekah Brooks.

In April, ''[[The Observer]]'' reported claims from a former minister that Rupert Murdoch tried to persuade Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] early in 2010 to help in resisting attempts by Labour MPs and peers to investigate the affair, and to go easy on ''News of the World'' in the run-up to the UK's general election of May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Helm; James Robinson.

''[[The Guardian]]''. 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; News International described the report as "total rubbish"; a spokesperson for Brown declined to comment.

The BBC reported on 20 May 2011 that a senior ''News of the World'' executive was implicated, according to actor [[Jude Law]]'s barrister in the High Court. This report also said that the number of people whose phones may have been hacked may be much larger than previously thought. The High Court was said to have been told that "notebooks belonging to a private investigator hired by News Group Newspapers contained thousands of mobile phone numbers" and "police also found 149 individual personal identification numbers and almost 400 unique voicemail numbers which can be used to access voice mail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13473347 |publisher=BBC News | title=Hacking row: News of the World executive 'implicated' | date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==July 2011: new allegations==

===Milly Dowler's voicemail===
It was first reported by ''The Guardian'' on 4 July 2011 that police had found evidence suggesting that the private investigator [[Glenn Mulcaire]] collected personal information about the family of the missing [[Surrey]] teenager [[Murder of Milly Dowler|Milly Dowler]], following her disappearance in March 2002 and the discovery of her body six months later.&lt;ref name="dowlerallegation"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the paper, journalists working for the ''News of the World'' had hired private investigators to hack into Dowler's voicemail inbox shortly after her disappearance. It was alleged that they had deleted some messages, giving false hope to police and to Dowler's family, who thought that she might have deleted the messages and therefore might still be alive and potentially destroying valuable evidence about her abduction and any evidence against a potential abductor and murderer. 

[[Levi Bellfield]] had been convicted of the murder just two weeks before these revelations – he had already been convicted of two murders and an attempted murder which took place after Milly's disappearance and the discovery of her body. It was later established that Dowler's phone had deleted the messages automatically, 72 hours after being listened to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fiveash|first=Kelly|title=NotW didn't delete Milly Dowler 'false hope' voicemail|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/12/notw_dowler_voicemail/|work=The Register|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' commented that the ''News of the World'' did not conceal from its readers in an article on 14 April 2002 that it had intercepted telephone messages and also informed Surrey police of this fact on 27 March 2002, six days after Milly went missing.&lt;ref name="dowlerallegation" /&gt;

===7/7 London attack victims===
On the day before the sixth anniversary of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], it was reported that relatives of some victims may have had their telephones snooped on by the ''[[News of the World]]'' in the aftermath of the attacks. A man who lost two children in the bombings told the BBC that police officers investigating phone hacking had warned him that their contact details were found on a target list, while a former firefighter who helped rescue injured passengers also said he had been contacted by police who were looking into the hacking allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14040841 |title=News of the World 'hacked 7/7 family phones' |publisher=BBC News |date=6 July 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of survivors from the bombings revealed that police had warned them their phones may have been hacked and their messages intercepted; in some cases they were advised to change security codes and PINs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hutchinson |first=Lisa |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2011/07/07/tyneside-7-7-bombings-survivor-lisa-french-has-been-contacted-by-detectives-investigating-news-of-the-world-phone-hacking-scandal-72703-29009171/ |title=Tyneside 7/7 bombings survivor Lisa French has been contacted by detectives investigating News of the World phone hacking scandal. – Chronicle News – News |publisher=ChronicleLive |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201141110/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2011/07/07/tyneside-7-7-bombings-survivor-lisa-french-has-been-contacted-by-detectives-investigating-news-of-the-world-phone-hacking-scandal-72703-29009171/ |archivedate=1 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/london_bombing_survivor_threatens_to_sue_over_hacking_1_956554 |title=London bombing survivor threatens to sue over hacking – News |publisher=Kent News |accessdate=18 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812034940/http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/london_bombing_survivor_threatens_to_sue_over_hacking_1_956554 |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan Ryan |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/warnings-of-potential-irish-victims-of-notw-phone-hacking-172128-Jul2011/ |title=Warnings of potential Irish victims of NOTW phone hacking · TheJournal |publisher=Thejournal.ie |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sara Payne===
On 28 July, ''The Guardian'' reported that the ''News of the World'' hacked into the voicemail of media campaigner [[Sara Payne]], whose eight-year-old daughter, [[Murder of Sarah Payne|Sarah Payne]], was murdered in [[West Sussex]] by [[paedophile]] [[Roy Whiting]], in July 2000. This news was arguably met with even more public outrage than the Dowler revelations, given the prominent role that Rebekah Brooks and the ''News of the World'' played in the passage of [[Sarah's Law]], which changed [[sex offender]] laws in the UK. Sara Payne has been an active campaigner in favour of such laws with News International and other media and charity organisations since her daughter's death.

Brooks developed a long-standing friendship with Sara Payne in the years after her daughter's death; Payne wrote a column praising the ''News of the World''{{'s}} support for Sarah's Law in its final issue, writing that the paper's staff "supported me through some of the darkest, most difficult times of my life and became my trusted friends".&lt;ref&gt;Nick Davies; Amelia Hill. [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/28/phone-hacking-sarah-payne "News of the World targeted phone of Sarah Payne's mother"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. 28 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks used the Sarah's Law campaign to defend the ''News of the World'' when she was questioned by the [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee]].

Scotland Yard had reportedly found materials pertaining to Payne in Glenn Mulcaire's notes. They also discovered that Payne's voicemail was on a mobile phone given to her by Brooks, ostensibly to help her keep in touch with supporters. Brooks issued a statement denying that the ''News of the World'' was aware of Mulcaire's targeting of Payne, saying that such an idea was "unthinkable". Payne was said to be "absolutely devastated and deeply disappointed" at the disclosure.

===Other victims===
Some email messages were discovered suggesting Jonathan Rees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/11/phone-hacking-dark-arts-jonathan-rees |title=Phone hacking: The dark arts of Jonathan Rees |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; made requests for sums of around £1,000 for contact details of senior members of the Royal Family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14107410 |title=News of the World 'paid royal police officer' |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=12 July 2011 |date=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012 it was reported that billionaire [[Robert Agostinelli]] had been targeted by a private detective named Steve Whitamore working for [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s newspaper to gain confidential information pertaining to Agostinelli's business affairs – this evidence brought to light the fact that high-profile U.S citizens were targeted by private investigators in the UK within Rupert Murdoch's empire.

==Aftermath==

===Closure of the ''News of the World''===

[[File:Final NOTW cover.jpeg|thumb|The final edition of ''[[News of the World]]'', published on 10 July 2011.]]
The closure of the ''News of the World'' after 168 years in print, was the first significant effect of the scandal. In the days leading up to 7 July 2011, [[Virgin Holidays]], [[The Co-operative Group]], [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[General Motors]] (owner of [[Vauxhall Motors]]) had all pulled their advertisements from the ''News of the World'' in response to the unfolding controversy. Several other major advertisers also considered doing the same.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|author=Laura Smith-Spark, CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/BUSINESS/07/06/uk.phonehacking.ads/index.html |title=Firms reconsider ad deals over newspaper phone hacking scandal |publisher=CNN |accessdate=12 July 2011 |date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his resignation announcement, Hinton said that he was not told of "evidence that wrongdoing went further" but indicated that he nevertheless felt it "proper" to resign from his position.&lt;ref name="hintonresign2" /&gt;

On 17 July, the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police]] and Britain's most senior police officer, [[Paul Stephenson (police officer)|Sir Paul Stephenson]], announced his resignation with immediate effect.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson's resignation was followed by that of [[Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|assistant commissioner]] [[John Yates (police officer)|John Yates]] on 18 July. Yates had been criticised for failing to re-open the original 2006 investigation into phone hacking at News International, despite new evidence coming to light in 2009. In the wake of the later 2012 allegations against ''The Sun'' and arrests of executives, senior reporters and other personnel, James Murdoch resigned from his posts as News International executive chairman and BSkyB chairman on 1 March 2012. Later that July, Rupert Murdoch resigned from his directorships at Times Newspaper Holdings, NewsCorp Investments and News International Group Limited.

===Dismissals===
Matt Nixson was escorted by security from the Wapping headquarters of ''The Sun'' newspaper the evening of 20 July 2011. His computer was seized by News International officials and the police were said to have been informed. Nixson was a features editor at ''The Sun''. It was reported that Nixson's dismissal was related to the time he spent at the ''News of the World'' from 2006, when it was edited by Coulson. At the ''News of the World'' he reported to assistant editor [[Ian Edmondson]].

Details emerged 7 September 2011 that senior journalist Amelia Hill of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was questioned under caution but not arrest, for several hours by officers from Operation Weeting the previous week. Hill had reported the names of individuals linked to the phone hacking scandal minutes after their arrests and it is thought her questioning was linked to the earlier arrest of a 51-year-old detective suspected of leaking information to the newspaper.

[[File:Rupert-Murdoch-ad-001.jpeg|thumb|A full-page apology ad published in British newspapers by News International. The letter, signed by Rupert Murdoch, begins: "The ''News of the World'' was in the business of holding others to account. It failed when it came to itself."&lt;ref name="Sorrypage"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/14/phone-hacking-apologise-national|title=Phone hacking: NI plans full page apology in national press|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=14 July 2011|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
From 15 July, onwards, News Corp began to change its position through a series of public apologies. On 15 July, Rupert Murdoch in interview with the News Corp owned ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' apologised for the ''News of the World'' letting slip the group's standards of journalism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Murdoch also alleged that the group's legal advisers, Harbottle &amp; Lewis, had made "a major mistake" in its part in the internal investigation into phone-hacking in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalweek.com/legal-week/news/2094408/murdoch-cites-major-mistakes-legal-adviser-culmination-drama|title=Murdoch cites 'major mistake' at legal adviser in culmination of a week of high drama|author=Suzi Ring|publisher=LegalWeek.com|date=15 July 2011|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July, Harbottle &amp; Lewis issued an open letter outlining its position, and appointed [[George Pitcher#Luther Pendragon|Luther Pendragon]] to handle PR issues relating to the affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalweek.com/legal-week/news/2094792/harbottle-defends-hackgate-position-grabiner-tipped-lead-newscorp-clean|title=Harbottle Defends Hackgate Position|publisher=LegalWeek.com|date=18 July 2011|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 and 17 July, News International published two full-page apologies in many of Britain's national newspapers. The first apology took the form of a letter, signed by Rupert Murdoch, in which he said sorry for the "serious wrongdoing" that occurred. The second was titled "Putting right what's gone wrong", and gave more detail about the steps News International was taking to address the public's concerns.

On the afternoon before the ads were published, Rupert Murdoch also attended a private meeting in London with the family of [[Murder of Milly Dowler|Milly Dowler]], where he apologised for the hacking of their murdered daughter's voicemail. The Dowler family's solicitor later said Murdoch appeared shaken and upset during the talks. He added that the Dowlers were surprised Murdoch's son James did not attend and called on the News International chairman to "take some responsibility" in the affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14170756 |title= Rupert Murdoch 'sorry' in newspaper adverts |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=16 July 2011 |date=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012 the ''Daily Mail'' published a story which it claimed was "evidence of the incestuous relationship between the Metropolitan Police and News International" and a political connection to David Cameron. In late 2010 the Mail had sought confirmation from the Prime Minister's office of a rumour that Cameron had been seen out riding horses with Rebekah Brooks's husband, Charlie Brooks, a horse trainer. Coulson, as Communications Director for Cameron had denied this. In March 2012, after the PM's office had denied the story again for three days, the Mail reported that Cameron had finally admitted that he had been out riding with Brooks back in 2010. He also admitted that the horse had been Raisa, a horse on loan to Rebekah Brooks from the Metropolitan Police.&lt;ref name="horsegate"&gt;{{Cite news

In February 2013 News International expressed "sincere" contrition and paid undisclosed "substantial" damages for a total of 144 cases. Among 17 phone-hacking victims given public apologies by News International in the High Court were [[Sarah, Duchess of York]], actors [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Christopher Eccleston]], the Catholic parish priest of singer [[Charlotte Church]], singer [[James Blunt]], [[Uri Geller]], [[Geoffrey Robinson]], the former Labour minister, and Colin Stagg, the man wrongly accused of the [[murder of Rachel Nickell]]. Mr Stagg, one of the few to have his damages disclosed, was awarded £15,500.  Others who settled but opted to keep the terms of the arrangement private, included [[Cherie Blair]], the wife of the former prime minister, [[UK Independence Party]] leader [[Nigel Farage]], TV presenters [[Jamie Theakston]] and [[Chris Tarrant]], Ted Beckham, the father of the former England football captain, former Tory minister [[David Maclean]], Baron Blencathra, actor [[James Nesbitt]], footballer [[Wayne Rooney]] and BBC reporter [[Tom Mangold]].&lt;ref name=JCusick&gt;{{cite web |author=James Cusick|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/hugh-grant-gets-an-apology-from-murdoch-8486935.html

====Neil Wallis====
Former ''News of the World'' executive editor [[Neil Wallis]] was arrested in west London on 14 July, on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications. He joined the paper in 2003 as a deputy to Coulson and in 2007, became an executive editor before leaving in 2009. Later that year his media consultancy company began to advise [[Paul Stephenson (police officer)|Paul Stephenson]] and [[John Yates (police officer)|John Yates]], two high-ranking Metropolitan Police officers, providing "strategic communications advice" until September 2010. During that time, Yates made the decision that the phone hacking needed no further investigation, despite ''The Guardian'' alleging that the previous investigation had been inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2011/jul/14/phone-hacking-scandal-live-coverage?commentpage=all#block-65|title=Phone hacking scandal – live coverage – 4.32&amp;nbsp;pm|author=Paul Owen|date=14 July 2011|accessdate=14 July 2011|work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also paid to advise commissioner Stephenson and Yates.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;

====Jonathan Rees and Alex Marunchak====
On 2 October 2012, two individuals associated with the [[News media phone hacking scandal#Operation Nigeria|earliest investigations (1999) into the phone hacking scandal]] were arrested.  Private investigator [[Jonathan Rees]] and ''[[News of the World]]'' journalist Alex Marunchak were arrested for alleged offences under section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and sections 1 and 2 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 by police officers working on [[Operation Kalmyk]], part of [[Operation Tuleta]] dealing with computer hacking.&lt;ref name=GuardianRees20121002&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dodd, Vikram  |author2=Jason Deans |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Alex Marunchak and Jonathan Rees held as part of Operation Kalmyk|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/02/alex-marunchak-jonathan-rees-operation-kalmy |date=2 October 2012|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arrests came thirteen years after Rees' premises were raided under Operation Nigeria, during which large amounts of evidence indicating widespread illegal trafficking in confidential information was seized by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]]. Marunchak was arrested by Scotland Yard detectives on 2 October 2012 and remained on bail for 23 months until 16 September 2014 when he was released from bail. In a formal letter to him the following year, on 9 September 2015, the Crown Prosecution Service stated it had "concluded that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction in respect of offences contrary to the Computer Misuse Act (for ‘computer hacking’ offences)", "that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for any associated or alternative offences" and "that no further action be taken in relation to this matter."

===Murdochs and Brooks summonsed &lt;!-- The word is summonsed, it's not a typo --&gt;to Parliament===
On 14 July, the [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] served a [[summons]] on Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks, expecting them to appear before the parliamentary committee on 19 July. After an initial invitation to give evidence to the committee, Brooks stated she would attend but the Murdochs declined. Rupert Murdoch claimed to be unavailable on that date but said he would be "fully prepared" to give evidence in Leveson's inquiry, while James Murdoch offered to appear on an alternative date, the earliest of which was 10 August. The Murdochs did, however, later confirm they would attend after the committee issued them a summons to Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14148658 Phone hacking: Murdochs agree to appear before MPs]. [[BBC News]], 14 July 2011. Retrieved 18 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] and Martin Hickman report in their book ''Dial M For Murdoch'' that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unbeknown to members of the Culture Committee, the NOTW established a team to investigate their private lives. For several days, as chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck would later tell Tom Watson, reporters searched for any secret lovers or extra-marital affairs that could be used as leverage against the MPs.

Thurlbeck said: "All I know is that, when the DCMS [Department of Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee] was formed or rather when it got onto all the hacking stuff, there was an edict came down from the editor and it was find out every single thing you can about every single member: who was gay, who had affairs, anything we can use.

"Each reporter was given two members and there were six reporters that went on for around 10 days. I don't know who looked at you. It fell by the wayside; I think even Ian Edmondson [the news editor] realised there was something quite horrible about doing this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/exclusive-extracts-from-dial-m-for-murdoch-7661728.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Tom | last=Watson | date=20 April 2012 | title=Exclusive extracts from 'Dial M for Murdoch'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At their appearance before the committee, Rupert Murdoch said it had been "the most humble day of my life" and argued that since he ran a global business of 53,000 employees and that the ''News of the World'' was "just 1 percent" of this, he was not ultimately responsible for what went on at the tabloid; he added that he had not considered resigning. Meanwhile, his son James described the "illegal voicemail interceptions" as a "matter of great regret" but that the company was "determined to put things right and make sure they do not happen again". James Murdoch stated that News International had based its "push back" against new allegations on the combination of three pieces of evidence: that the Metropolitan Police had closed their investigation, that the Crown Prosecution Service had closed their prosecution and that they had received written advice from their legal advisors Harbottle &amp; Lewis, that there was nothing to suggest phone hacking was not the work of one "rogue reporter" working with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire.&lt;ref name=BBC14195259&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14195259|title=Phone hacking: 'Humbled' Murdoch rejects blame|publisher=BBC News |date=19 July 2011|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the Murdochs' two hours of evidence, a protestor sitting in the public gallery, identified as comedian Jonnie Marbles, threw a [[Shaving cream|shaving-foam]] pie at Rupert Murdoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8648117/News-of-the-World-phone-hacking-live.html|title=Rupert Murdoch attacked by protester|date=19 July 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=19 July 2011|location=London|first=Andrew|last=Hough}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident propelled Murdoch's wife, [[Wendi Deng Murdoch]], into the media spotlight for her athletic response in defence of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protester Attacks Rupert Murdoch in UK Parliament|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/rupertmurdoch-pieattack/2011/07/19/id/404155|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=NewsMax|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wendi Deng: just who is the smack-down sister?|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/wendi-deng-just-who-is-the-smack-down-sister|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=Channel 4 News|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marbles later said that he had "much respect" for Deng for fighting back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murdoch pie thrower has respect for Wendi|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/murdoch-pie-thrower-has-respect-for-wendi|accessdate=23 July 2011|newspaper=Channel 4 News|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marbles, real name Jonathan May-Bowles, was sentenced to six weeks in prison for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14370398 |title=Murdoch foam attack: 'Jonnie Marbles' jailed |date=2 August 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harbottle &amp; Lewis later commented that it could not respond to "any inaccurate statements or contentions" about the 2007 letter to News International due to client confidentiality.&lt;ref name=BBC14195259/&gt; Later on the same day, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee, former director of public prosecutions Lord MacDonald stated that it took him "three to five minutes" to decide that the same emails contained in the file passed to Harbottle &amp; Lewis contained "blindingly obvious" evidence of corrupt payments to police officers, which had to be immediately passed to the Metropolitan Police.&lt;ref name=GuardMacD110719&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/19/news-corp-police-payments-macdonald|title=News Corp board shocked at evidence of payments to police, says former DPP|author=Owen Bowcott|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC14197962&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14197962 |title=Ex-Met Police chief denies 'swipe' at prime minister |publisher=BBC News |date=20 July 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The testimony of James Murdoch was questioned by two former News International executives. Murdoch had denied reading or being aware of an email, sent after he authorised an out-of-court payment to Gordon Taylor over the hacking of his phone, which suggested the practice was more widely used than just by a rogue ''News of the World'' reporter. A former editor of the newspaper, Colin Myler and Tom Crone, the former News International legal manager, both said they "did inform" him of the email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14242763 |title=James Murdoch evidence questioned by former executives |publisher=BBC News |date=21 July 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News Corporation's management standards committee===
On 18 July, News Corporation announced that its UK management standards committee would be removed from News International. It will now be housed in a separate building,&lt;ref name=BBC14183505/&gt; under the chairmanship of [[Anthony Grabiner, Baron Grabiner|Lord Grabiner]], and reporting to News Corporation director [[Joel Klein]].

===Death of Sean Hoare===
On 18 July, former ''News of the World'' journalist [[Sean Hoare]], who was the first reporter to tell of "endemic" phone hacking at the publication for which he used to work, was found dead at his home in [[Watford]], Hertfordshire. A police spokesperson said the death was treated as "unexplained" but not suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14194623 |title=NoW phone-hacking whistle-blower Sean Hoare found dead |publisher=BBC News |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Amelia Hill, James Robinson  |author2=Caroline Davies  |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/18/news-of-the-world-sean-hoare |title=News of the World phone-hacking whistleblower found dead |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=18 August 2011 |date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, the coroner for Hertfordshire concluded that Hoare died of natural causes after suffering from liver disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-NoW reporter Sean Hoare 'died of natural causes'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15855935|newspaper=BBC News|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Daily Mirror'' allegations===
[[File:Piers Morgan - 2011 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Piers Morgan]] was editor of ''The Daily Mirror'' from 1995 to 2004]]
On 20 July, ''[[Private Eye]]'' asked how the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' had, early in 2003, obtained a transcript of phone calls by [[Angus Deayton]] and in October 2003 had come into possession of every call and text message made by [[Rio Ferdinand]] one afternoon (when he claimed to have missed a drugs test due to having his mobile switched off). The latter story was co-written by [[James Weatherup]], who moved to the ''[[News of the World]]'' the following year.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Private Eye]]'', "Brooks and Brooksmen", issue 1293, p9&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July, former ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' financial journalist [[James Hipwell]] spoke to ''[[The Independent]]'', claiming that the practice had been "endemic" at the Mirror during his time there under the editorship of [[Piers Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Former-Mirror-Reporter-James-Hipwell-Makes-New-Hacking-Claim-Against-Daily-Mirror/Article/201107416035919?lpos=UK_News_First_Home_Article_Teaser_Region_1&amp;lid=ARTICLE_16035919_Former_Mirror_Reporter_James_Hipwell_Makes_New_Hacking_Claim_Against_Daily_Mirror |title=Ex-Mirror Journalist Makes New Hacking Claim |work=Sky News |date=23 July 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/hacking-was-endemic-at-the-mirror-says-former-reporter-2319039.html|title= Hacking was endemic at the 'Mirror', says former reporter|first= James|last= Burrell|first2= Ian|last2= Burrell|publisher=Independent Print Limited|work=The Independent |location=UK |date= 23 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|"They would call a celebrity with one phone and when it was answered they would then hang up. . . .

He also alleged that phone hacking took place at some of the Mirror's sister publications. [[Trinity Mirror]], the publisher of the ''Daily Mirror'' and ''Sunday Mirror'', rejected Hipwell's claims. A spokesman said: "Our position is clear.... Our journalists work within the criminal law and the Press Complaints Commission code of conduct."&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; The BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme reported other sources at the ''Sunday Mirror'' confirming use of phone hacking, with one source saying "At one point in 2004, it seemed like it was the only way people were getting scoops." It was also said that the paper made use of private investigators.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 23 July 2011, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/23/phone-hacking-sunday-mirror-newsnight Phone hacking used by Sunday Mirror, claims BBC Newsnight]&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 July Trinity Mirror announced an internal review of its editorial procedures.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 July 2011, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/26/daily-mirror-publisher-to-review-editorial-controls Daily Mirror publisher to review editorial controls]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August, [[Heather Mills]] alleged that a senior journalist working for Trinity Mirror had admitted to her in 2001 that the company had access to voicemail messages which they knew to have been obtained by hacking. In response Trinity Mirror repeated the statement used in rejecting James Hipwell's claims, saying "Our position is clear. All our journalists work within the criminal law and the PCC code of conduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14393925 |title=Heather Mills 'told she was phone-hacking target' |date=3 August 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 3 August, [[Piers Morgan]] issued a statement through CNN, his employer, that "I have never hacked a phone, told anyone to hack a phone, nor to my knowledge published any story obtained from the hacking of a phone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/05/world/europe/05hacking.html?pagewanted=all |title=Calls for CNN Host to Testify in Hacking Scandal |author=Burns, John F. |date =4 August 2011 |work=The New York Times| accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement omitted comment on whether he had any knowledge of phone hacking by employees or paid contractors of the Mirror during the period he was editor there.

That Morgan did have knowledge of phone hacking is suggested in his own 2006 article in the ''Daily Mail'', regarding a phone message from [[Paul McCartney]] to his girlfriend Heather Mills in which Morgan stated, "At one stage I was played a tape of a message Paul had left for Heather on her mobile phone. It was heartbreaking. . . The couple had clearly had a tiff, Heather had fled to India, and Paul was pleading with her to come back. He sounded lonely, miserable and desperate, and even sang 'We Can Work It Out ' into the answer phone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-411323/Im-sorry-Macca-introducing-monster.html |title=I'm sorry, Macca, for introducing you to this monster |author=Morgan, Piers |date=19 October 2006 | work=Daily Mail |accessdate=5 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 August, Heather Mills told BBC's Newsnight: "There was absolutely no honest way that Piers Morgan could have obtained that tape&amp;nbsp;... unless they had gone into my voice messages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14393925 |title=Heather Mills 'told she was phone-hacking target' | date=3 August 2011 |publisher=BBC News | accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harbottle and Lewis===
During the internal investigation into the unfair dismissal claim against News Group Newspapers Limited by Clive Goodman, News International hired law firm [[Harbottle &amp; Lewis]] (H&amp;L) and passed on hundreds of internal emails to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2015461/News-World-phone-hacking-Why-did-Prince-Williams-lawyers-hide-evidence.html|title = Why did Prince William's lawyers hide hacking evidence?

The letter from Mr Abramson to Mr Chapman makes no mention of whether the e-mails contain evidence of wrongdoing by journalists other than Mr Goodman.&lt;ref name="smoking gun" /&gt;

It was reported{{when|date=April 2012}} that NI executives urged H&amp;L to give them a clean bill of health in the strongest possible terms, that earlier draft letters by H&amp;L were rejected by NI and that lawyers on both sides seemed to struggle to find language that said the review had found no evidence of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/30/world/europe/30letter.html |title=2007 Letter Clearing a Tabloid Comes Under Scrutiny|work=The New York Times|date=31 July 2011|accessdate=31 July 2011|first1=Jo|last1=Becker|first2=Don|last2=Van Natta Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information was provided by "two people familiar with both the contents of the e-mails and the discussions between the executives and the law firm". This letter was used by various News International executives in their defence during a parliamentary investigation into phone hacking in 2009.&lt;ref name="smoking gun"/&gt;

In July 2011, Rupert Murdoch alleged in interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that H&amp;L made [[News of the World royal phone hacking scandal#Unfair dismissal claim|"a major mistake" in its part in an internal investigation into phone-hacking]] at News International.&lt;ref name="RM accuses H&amp;L"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14195259|publisher=BBC News |date=20 July 2011|title= Phone hacking: 'Humbled' Murdoch rejects blame}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2011, H&amp;L issued an open letter outlining its position,&lt;ref name=LegalWeek2094792&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legalweek.com/legal-week/news/2094792/harbottle-defends-hackgate-position-grabiner-tipped-lead-newscorp-clean|title=Harbottle defends Hackgate position; Grabiner to lead News Corp clean-up|publisher=Legal Week.com|date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed Luther Pendragon to handle PR issues relating to the affair.&lt;ref name=LegalWeek2094792/&gt; On 19 July, Lord MacDonald the former Director of Public Prosecutions engaged by News Corporation to review the emails handed to Harbottle &amp; Lewis in 2007, said in evidence to the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]]:

At his appearance before the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on 19 July, James Murdoch stated that News International had based its "push back" against new allegations on the combination of three pieces of evidence and one of these was the written advice from H&amp;L.&lt;ref name="RM accuses H&amp;L"/&gt;

On 20 July, H&amp;L issued a statement saying that they had asked News International to release them from their professional duty of confidentiality, which had been declined by News International. The company had since written to [[John Whittingdale]] MP, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, asking to provide evidence to the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-sport/Harbottle_and_Lewis_letter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203002940/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-sport/Harbottle_and_Lewis_letter.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrne |first=Matt |url=http://www.thelawyer.com/harbottle-forbidden-from-responding-to-news-internationals-put-down/1008692.article |title=Harbottle forbidden from responding to News International's put-down  |work=The Lawyer |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July, Tom Watson MP published a letter from the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]], in response to his letter expressing concerns about Harbottle and Lewis's part in the phone-hacking affair. In the letter, Anthony Townsend, chief executive of the SRA said:

{{cquote|On the basis of our preliminary review of the public domain material, we have decided to instigate a formal investigation. We will pursue our investigation vigorously and thoroughly, but emphasise that our inquiries are at an early stage, and that no conclusions have been reached about whether there may have been any impropriety by any solicitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tom-watson.co.uk/2011/07/response-from-solicitors-regulation-authority-harbottle-lewis |title=Response from Solicitors Regulation Authority – Harbottle &amp; Lewis – Tom Watson MP |publisher=Tom-watson.co.uk |date=22 July 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808150051/http://www.tom-watson.co.uk/2011/07/response-from-solicitors-regulation-authority-harbottle-lewis/ |archivedate=8 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Culture, Media and Sport Committee wrote to H&amp;L on 29 July asking a series of detailed questions about the interaction between NI and H&amp;L.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/PH20A-Chairman-to-Harbottle-and-Lewis-29-July-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; H&amp;L replied to this request on 11 August.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/PH20HarbottleandLewis11Aug2011coveringletter.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/PH20.2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817183749/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/PH20.2.pdf |archivedate=17 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in what was described as "a withering attack on News International and the Murdochs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14542092|title=Phone hacking: Murdochs savaged by Harbottle|date=18 August 2011 | publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H&amp;L said that it provided very narrow advice on whether the emails in question could be used to support Clive Goodman's allegations, that his illegal activities were known about and supported by other employees at NOTW. They were not retained to provide NI with a "good conduct certificate" which they could show to parliament. H&amp;L state that the terms of their contract with NI explicitly stated that their advice should not be disclosed to a third party without H&amp;L's written consent. They also state that if NI "had approached them (as it should have done) before presenting the letter to Parliament as evidence of its corporate innocence, H&amp;L would not have agreed to this without further discussion". They also state that they could not have reported NI to the police even if they had found evidence of criminal activity in the emails, because of client confidentiality. Their fee for the work was £10,294 + VAT. The letter suggests that this amount be compared with James Murdoch's evidence where he said that he had been told that the litigation costs in the Gordon Taylor and Max Clifford cases were expected to be between £500,000 and £1m.

===Criminal charges and convictions===
{{Main article|Metropolitan Police role in the News International phone hacking scandal}}

Charges and a total of [[News International phone hacking scandal reference lists#Convictions|seven convictions]] concerning the illegal acquisition of confidential information were made in three separate waves in 2004–2005, 2006 and 2012. Further convictions resulted from the ''[[R v Coulson, Brooks and others]]'' trial which concluded in July 2014.&lt;ref name=verdict/&gt;

On 24 July 2012, charges were brought against eight former employees and agents of the ''[[News of the World]]'' including editors [[Rebekah Brooks]] and [[Andy Coulson]]. Of the thirteen suspects that had been referred to the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] for review under [[Operation Weeting]], eight were charged with a total of nineteen charges, three were not to be pursued due to insufficient evidence, and two were to continue to be investigated.  Seven of the eight were "charged with conspiring to intercept communications without lawful authority from 3rd October 2000 to 9th August 2006."  All eight were charged regarding illegal interception of communications relating to specific individuals&lt;ref name="CPS20120724"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianCharged20120724"/&gt;

The trial ''[[R v Coulson, Brooks and others]]'' began in October 2013. In December 2013 the trial judge announced that Ian Edmondson was unwell and that his case would be considered at a separate hearing when he recovered.&lt;ref name="unfit"&gt;{{cite web |author=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-25352013|title=Defendant Ian Edmondson 'unfit' for hacking trial|date=12 December 2013|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2014 the trial jury found Coulson guilty of one charge of conspiracy to hack phones and failed to agree a verdict on two other charges in relation to the alleged purchase of confidential royal phone directories in 2005 from a police officer. Brooks and the five remaining defendants were found not guilty.&lt;ref name=verdict&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=Hacking trial: Coulson guilty, Brooks cleared of charges |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27997688 |work=BBC News|accessdate=20 August 2014|date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2014 the trial judge announced that Coulson and Clive Goodman, would face a retrial on the outstanding charges.&lt;ref name="LisaoC"&gt;{{cite web |author=Lisa O'Carroll|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/30/andy-coulson-retrial-clive-goodman-phone-hacking-trial|title=Andy Coulson to face retrial over alleged payments to public officials|date=30 June 2014|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentences were announced on 4 July 2014, with Coulson receiving 18 months imprisonment, former chief reporter [[Neville Thurlbeck]] and news editor [[Greg Miskiw]] sentences of six months each, former reporter [[James Weatherup]] a four-month suspended sentence and former private investigator [[Glenn Mulcaire]] a six-month suspended sentence.

On 3 October 2014, Ian Edmondson pleaded guilty to conspiring with Glenn Mulcaire and others to intercept private voicemails between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006. Edmondson was jailed for eight months on 7 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29953209 |title= Ian Edmondson jailed over News of the World hacking plot |date=7 November 2014|website=BBC News | accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further UK investigations==
The scandal has triggered multiple investigations from various governmental agencies looking at other News Corporation-owned media outlets in addition to ''News of the World''.

With the unfolding scandal at the ''News of the World'' came allegations that another News Corporation-owned tabloid, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', itself engaged in phone hacking. In February 2011, the Metropolitan Police investigated the claims of Scottish trade union leader Andy Gilchrist, who accused ''The Sun'' of hacking into his mobile phone to run negative stories about him; the stories were published shortly after Rebekah Brooks was installed as the paper's editor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/now-met-police-probes-the-sun-after-union-chief-raises-concerns-2208670.html Now Met Police probes 'The Sun' after union chief raises concerns], ''The Independent'', 9 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2011, the head of the Press Complaints Commission [[Baroness Buscombe]] said in interview with [[Andrew Neil]] on the BBC programme ''[[The Daily Politics]]'', that she had been lied to by the ''News of the World'' over phone hacking.&lt;ref name=GuardBuscombe&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/05/phone-hacking-lie-pcc-buscombe|title=Phone hacking: Buscombe admits News of the World lied to PCC|author=Tara Conlan|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buscombe said that she did not know the extent of the scandal when she joined the PCC in 2009, but stated that she had been "misled by the News of the World" after she had previously concluded just the opposite.&lt;ref name=GuardBuscombe/&gt; Buscome further admitted that her statement put out in 2009, when the PCC had reviewed the 2007 evidence, that "Having reviewed all the information available, we concluded that we were not materially misled;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NjA0OQ==|title=Statement By Baroness Buscombe, Chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, On New Evidence in the Phone Message Hacking Episode|publisher=Press Complaints Commission|date=15 November 2009|accessdate=19 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318003206/http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NjA0OQ==|archivedate=18 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was now{{When|date=July 2011}} in hindsight incorrect.&lt;ref name=GuardBuscombe/&gt; This led to Labour leader Ed Miliband calling the PCC a "toothless poodle," and in agreement with Prime Minister David Cameron proposed the creation of a new press watchdog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14073718|title=Phone hacking: Cameron and Miliband demand new watchdog|publisher=BBC News |date=8 July 2011|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July, the day after the ''News of the World'' ceased publication, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that Scotland Yard was investigating both ''The Sun'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' for illegally gaining access to the financial, phone, and legal records of former prime minister [[Gordon Brown]]. It was also reported that ''The Sun'' improperly obtained medical information on Brown's infant son to publish stories about his diagnosis of [[cystic fibrosis]]. Brown issued a statement saying that his family was "shocked by the level of criminality and the unethical means by which personal details have been obtained."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/07/11/uk.phone.hacking.scandal/index.html Ex-British prime minister 'shocked' by new hacking claims], CNN, 11 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July, the satirical publication ''[[Private Eye]]'' reported that sometime between 2001 and 2004, a PR man for the [[BBC]] series ''[[EastEnders]]'' had suspected his voicemail was being intercepted. The ''Eye'' said that the man's suspicions were confirmed when he had a friend leave a voicemail concerning a fake story about ''EastEnders'', and that same evening received call from a ''Sun'' reporter declaring that they had "proof" of the fake story.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Private Eye]]'', issue 1293, p7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leveson inquiry===
{{Main article|Leveson Inquiry}}

On 6 July 2011, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] announced to parliament that a public government inquiry would convene to further investigate the affair. On 13 July, Cameron named [[Brian Leveson|Lord Justice Leveson]] as chairman of the inquiry, with a remit to look into the specific claims about phone hacking at the ''News of the World'', the initial police inquiry and allegations of illicit payments to police by the press, and a second inquiry to review the general culture and ethics of the British media.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt;

On 20 July 2011, Cameron announced to Parliament the final terms of reference of Leveson's inquiry, stating that it will extend beyond newspapers to include broadcasters and [[social media]]. He also announced a panel of six people who will work with the judge on the inquiry:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/20/phone-hacking-inquiry-broadcasters-social-media|title=Phone-hacking inquiry extended to include broadcasters and social media|author=Lisa O'Carroll|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was subsequently reported in the media that Leveson had attended two parties in the prior 12 months at the London home of [[Matthew Freud]], a PR executive married to [[Elisabeth Murdoch (businesswoman)|Elisabeth Murdoch]], the daughter of [[Rupert Murdoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8656131/Phone-hacking-inquiry-judge-attended-parties-at-home-of-Rupert-Murdochs-son-in-law.html|title=Phone hacking inquiry judge attended parties at home of Rupert Murdoch's son-in-law|accessdate=23 July 2011|work=The Telegraph|date=22 July 2011|location=London|first=Christopher|last=Hope}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23972388-investigate-james-murdoch-over-smoking-gun-email-urges-mp.do |title=MP calls for police to investigate Murdoch son over crucial email |accessdate=23 July 2011 |work=London Evening Standard |location=UK |date=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724071051/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23972388-investigate-james-murdoch-over-smoking-gun-email-urges-mp.do |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home Affairs Select Committee===
The [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] (HASC) has taken various forms of evidence and undertaking during the whole affair, and continues to investigate various aspects as part of its normal parliamentary undertakings.

On the afternoon of 19 July 2011, the HASC took evidence from both holders of the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions, for the period which covered the scandal.&lt;ref name=GuardMacD110719/&gt; Lord Macdonald, in charge of the Crown Prosecution Service when prosecution of Goodman and Mulcaire was undertaken, stated that he had only been alerted to the case due to the convention that the DPP is always notified of crimes involving the royal family.&lt;ref name=GuardMacD110719/&gt; Committee member [[Mark Reckless]], the then Conservative MP for [[Rochester and Strood (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochester and Strood]], stated that the original 2007 police investigation and the 2009 review had both been hindered by the advice from the CPS, that "phone hacking was only an offence if messages had been intercepted before they were listened to by the intended recipient;" which was in fact incorrect.&lt;ref name=GuardMacD110719/&gt; Current{{When|date=July 2011}} DPP Keir Starmer in evidence stated that the CPS had told the Metropolitan Police that "the RIPA legislation was untested."&lt;ref name=GuardMacD110719/&gt; Mark Lewis, the solicitor acting for a number of phone hacking victims including the family of Milly Dowler, stated in evidence that he was sacked from his job when fellow partners at his law firm stated they no longer wished to pursue other victims' claims. Lewis stated that he, ''The Guardian'' newspaper, and Labour MP Chris Bryant had all been threatened to be sued by solicitors [[Carter-Ruck]] acting for AC John Yates, all the costs for which after the actions were dropped were picked up by the Metropolitan Police; Lewis submitted letters from Carter Ruck in evidence to the committee. In closing, Lewis stated that the reason for the investigation having taken so long was not only due to the Metropolitan Police: "The DPP seems to have got it wrong and needs to be helped out."&lt;ref name=GuardMacD110719/&gt;

On 20 July 2011, the HASC published their completed report on the UK Parliament website. In that report, the Committee says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/news/110720-phone-hacking-report|title=Phone hacking: Select Committee Report|publisher=UK Parliament|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mark Lewis===
Lewis, who is not connected with the Harbotte &amp; Lewis firm, first engaged with ''News of the World'' in 2005 when it was moving to print a story asserting marital infidelity on Gordon Taylor's part. Lewis worked for George Davies Solicitors LLP in Manchester specialising in defamation cases and was able to persuade the paper not to run the story.&lt;ref name=timesofisrael-20170412/&gt; In 2006, in the criminal trial over the hacking of royals' voicemail accounts, it became public that the paper had also hacked, among others, Taylor's voicemail. In his "[[Eureka effect|eureka]] moment", Lewis realised then that it was hacked information which had led to the earlier story about Taylor. From that insight came the realisation that the paper had a potential civil liability from its hacking practices, and that led to Taylor's civil case. In 2011, working now with Taylor Hampton Solicitors in London, Lewis seems about to close a $4.7 million settlement in the Dowler case and has "more than 70 clients who believe ''News of the World'' illegally intercepted their cellphone voice mails", according to a ''Wall Street Journal'' story.&lt;ref&gt;Whalen, Jeanne, and Steve Stecklow, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903374004576582724169872208 "At the Eye of Hacking Storm: British Lawyer Mark Lewis Filed One of the First Suits Against News Corp."], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (a [[Rupert Murdoch|Murdoch-owned]] paper), 21 September 2011. Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee===
The [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] spent 6 September 2011 questioning four witnesses: the News of the World's former editor [[Colin Myler]], News Group Newspapers' former legal manager [[Tom Crone]], its former group [[human resources]] director, [[Daniel Cloke]], and News International's former director of legal affairs, Jonathan Chapman:.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, Tim, Salamander Davoudi and Kiran Stacey, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d67d7e22-d891-11e0-8f0a-00144feabdc0.html "Hacking inquiry puts heat back on Murdoch"], ''[[Financial Times]]'', 6 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the Commons privileges committee stated that Colin Myler and Tom Crone had misled the Culture, Media and Sport Committee during that meeting by "answering questions falsely", and found them found in [[contempt of Parliament]]. Myler and Crone rejected this finding.&lt;ref name=bbc20160914&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37362584|title=Phone hacking: News of the World pair in contempt of Parliament |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=15 September 2016 |date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* An investigation of the employment of Neil Wallis's daughter Amy with the Metropolitan Police, alleged to have been at the request of John Yates

===Elizabeth Filkin===
On 18 July 2011, it was announced that former parliamentary commissioner for standards [[Elizabeth Filkin]] would "recommend changes to links between the police and the media, including how to extend transparency."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 19 July 2011, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jul/18/phone-hacking-theresa-may-inquiries Phone hacking: Theresa May announces more inquiries]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clive Goodman's 2007 letter===
It was revealed that both [[John Whittingdale]] and [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] may need to speak to James Murdoch again as the Commons culture select committee about recalling James Murdoch. An MP has released a letter from the now jailed journalist, alleging senior ''News of the World'' figures knew that the hacking scandal was going on, when the former royal editor, [[Clive Goodman]], wrote his letter to News International as he appealed against his dismissal in 2007.&lt;ref name=bbc20110818&gt;{{cite news|author=Dominic Casciani |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14541848 |title=Hacking 'discussed' at News of the World, Clive Goodman letter says |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=18 August 2011 |date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical concerns, legal concerns and possible implications==
{{See also|News Corporation scandal}}

===Criticism of News International culture===
&lt;!--[[File:Private Eye Cover.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Private Eye]]'' cover satirising the scandal.]]--&gt;

The effect of the phone hacking scandal originating with the ''News of the World'' also raised wider questions about the ethics employed by companies under Murdoch's ownership, as well as the effects the scandal will have on the ethics employed specifically by print journalists and to some extent the wider world of journalism.&lt;ref name="GrossmanTravesty" /&gt;

Murdoch had previously been criticised for building a media empire that lacked any ethical base&lt;ref name="GrossmanTravesty"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karl-grossman/murdoch-media-empire-a-jo_b_896836.html Grossman, Karl. "Murdoch Media Empire: A Journalistic Travesty"] ''Huffington Post'' 13 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and replacing responsible journalism with "gossip, sensationalism, and manufactured controversy."&lt;ref name="BernsteinWatergate"&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2011/07/10/murdoch-s-watergate.html Bernstein, Carl. "Is Phone-Hacking Scandal Murdoch's Watergate?."] ''Newsweek'' 11 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Grossman]], a professor of journalism at [[State University of New York at Old Westbury]], accused Murdoch of building the most "dishonest, unprincipled and corrupt" media empire in history and of "making a travesty of what journalism is supposed to be about." Grossman also claimed that News Corporation changes the culture of their newly acquired news outlets, using them to promote Murdoch's political and financial interests. Once-acclaimed newspapers such as the ''[[New York Post]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[The Times]]'' have been accused of becoming an "instrument" to aide politicians that Murdoch favours.&lt;ref name="GrossmanTravesty" /&gt;

In ''[[Newsweek]]'' in July 2011, one of Murdoch's former top executives was quoted as saying: "This scandal and all its implications could not have happened anywhere else. Only in Murdoch's orbit. The hacking at ''News of the World'' was done on an industrial scale. More than anyone, Murdoch invented and established this culture in the newsroom, where you do whatever it takes to get the story, take no prisoners, destroy the competition, and the end will justify the means." This same executive went on to say, "In the end, what you sow is what you reap. Now Murdoch is a victim of the culture that he created. It is a logical conclusion, and it is his people at the top who encouraged lawbreaking and hacking phones and condoned it."&lt;ref name="BernsteinWatergate" /&gt;

In 2010, it was also suggested that the journalistic approach of such newspapers at the ''News of the World'' had brought into public focus that there had been a shift away from the traditional ethics of journalism, raising serious questions about privacy, freedom of speech, and confidentiality.&lt;ref name="MediaNow4"&gt;Straubhaar, Joseph, Robert LaRose, and Lucinda Davenport. Media Now: Understanding Media, Culture, and Technology. 6th ed. Boston, MA: Wadsworth, 2010. 477–488. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also observations in the North American Press about the ethics employed by the ''News of the World''. [[NBC New York]] noted that the old journalistic maxim, "Get it first. But, first, get it right," although speaking for accurate reporting does not address the situation where in the case of the ''News of the World'' information was allegedly obtained in an unethical way or by illegal means.&lt;ref name="PressmanEndMeans"&gt;[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/In-Journalism-the-End-Doesnt-Justify-the-Means-125446643.html Pressman, Gabe. "In Journalism, the End Doesn't Justify the Means."] NBC Newyork 12 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The approach was also criticised by [[Stephen B. Shepard]], dean of the [[CUNY Graduate School of Journalism]], who commenting on the phone hacking scandal, said: "It's wrong. It's not a grey area. What they did was illegal and, even if it weren't, it's just plain wrong. There's no defence for it. Even the government needs a warrant to get into a house or a computer. You can't break into something like this and get away with it."&lt;ref name="PressmanEndMeans" /&gt;

===Ethical backlash===
Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] first intimated in early July 2011 that an investigation by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] on media ethics and standards will be carried out. Soon after he announced that two independent enquiries, led by a senior judge would take place. This led to anxieties being expressed by newspaper editors about the impact of state media regulation on the free press.&lt;ref name="HeawoodManifesto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/13/media-ethics-investigation-david-cameron |author=Heawood, Jonathan|title=A new manifesto for media ethics |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also concerns amongst journalists that new regulations would be enacted as a means of reining in the press—"an attack on the power of the press itself"—rather than more effective self-regulation and ensuring a stricter enforcement of existing legislation to deter the use of phone hacking, breaches of privacy laws and bribery of public officials.&lt;ref name="DoctorowRein"&gt;Doctorow, Cory (14 July 2011).  [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jul/14/phone-hacking-internet-press "The phone-hacking scandal must not be used to rein in the press."] ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; A further major concern was expressed that more stringent regulation will not assist the ordinary people who were the subject of investigative journalism, whereas powerful corporations will still have the money, power, and resources to get out of any tough situation they might encounter.&lt;ref name="DoctorowRein" /&gt;

The consequences of the exposure of ethical transgressions that occurred at ''News of the World'' have also led to concerns that such practices could be happening at other News Corporation titles in Britain. Furthermore, there has been speculation that American news companies that are a part of Rupert Murdoch's media empire may have become implicated.&lt;ref name="McMahonScrutiny"&gt;McMahon, Barbara (15 July 2011). [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/15/rupert-murdoch-now-phone-hacking "Rupert Murdoch's US papers face closer scrutiny."] ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 the Ethical Investment Advisory Group (EIAG) of the [[Church of England]], England's [[Established church]], issued a statement stating that "The behaviour of the News of the World has been utterly reprehensible and unethical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2011/07/news-corporation-statement-from-ethical-investment-advisory-group.aspx|title=Top News Releases – The Church of England|work=Church of England News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012 the EIAG further announced that it had no confidence in News Corporation's stated intention of returning to ethical practices, and that as a result all Church of England organisations would cease investment in News Corporation. In practical terms this involved the [[Church Commissioners]] and the Church of England Pensions Board in selling shareholdings valued at around £1.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2012/08/church-of-england-disinvests-from-news-corporation.aspx|title=Top News Releases – The Church of England|work=Church of England News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact in other countries==
{{Main article|News Corporation scandal}}

===Australia===

====News Limited announces review====
In light of News Corporations global review, John Hartigan, the CEO of News Corporation's Australian company [[News Limited]], announced a review of all payments in the previous three years, and that he was personally willing to co-operate with any Australian Government led inquiry.&lt;ref name=BBC14212954&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14212954|title=Phone hacking: Australian PM promises 'hard questions'|publisher=BBC News |date=19 July 2011|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Green party called for a parliamentary inquiry into News Limited, but Hartigan directly denied allegations by both the Greens and the governing Labor party that News Limited has been running a campaign against them, describing his group's journalism as "aggressive but fair."&lt;ref name=BBC14212954/&gt;

====Australian Government announces formal review====
While the scope of the enquiry was yet to be finalised, a spokesman for the Communications Minister, Stephen Conroy, said that the current administration under the Labor Party had decided that an investigation was required.

The News Limited chairman, John Hartigan, vowed full co-operation with the government inquiry.&lt;ref name=Ausinq1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/8759338/Australia-to-hold-media-inquiry.html|title=Australia to hold media inquiry|work=The Telegraph|date=13 September 2011|accessdate=13 September 2011|location=London|first=Bonnie|last=Malkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, where News Corporation is headquartered and operates multiple media outlets, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] launched a probe on 14 July 2011, to determine whether News Corporation accessed voicemails of victims of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]]. On 15 July, US Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] announced an additional investigation by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], looking into whether the company had violated the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].

News Corporation owns a multitude of news outlets in the United States, including the ''[[New York Post]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and the [[Fox News Channel]]. Several media critics{{who|date=June 2013}} have called for investigations into whether they too engaged in phone hacking activities. In addition to any possible illegal activities in the US, News Corporation and/or its executives might also face civil and criminal liability under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/18/news-corp-global-investigation-bribery |title=News Corp faces global investigation into bribery |author=Ed Pilkington and Dominic Rushe |date=18 July 2011 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 US Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]] (D-NJ) wrote to Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]] after a small New Jersey marketing company called FLOORgraphics alleged that News America Marketing engaged in illegal computer espionage by breaking into password protected computer systems and obtaining confidential information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lautenberg.senate.gov/newsroom/record.cfm?id=333557 |title=Senator Frank R.

Further controversy was aroused by an unsigned editorial&lt;ref name="WSJeditorial"/&gt; in the News Corporation-owned ''Wall Street Journal'' which lashed out against the company's critics, specifically mentioning the [[BBC]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the news website [[ProPublica]]. At the same time, the editorial praised former ''Journal'' publisher [[Les Hinton]], who had just resigned in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.&lt;ref name="WSJeditorial"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303661904576451812776293184 |title=News and Its Critics |date=18 July 2011 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many observers were frustrated by ''The Wall Street Journal''{{'s}} comments. In [[Twitter|tweets]], [[Jay Rosen]], professor of journalism at [[New York University]], referred to the "deluded dishonest whining victimology delivered in the form of a Wall Street Journal editorial on the phone hacking crisis" and [[Sarah Ellison]] of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' commented: "Tonite's WSJ Editorial is sad. I've always defended the Edit page, but now It's a PR arm."&lt;ref name="WSJcontroversy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/wsj-editorial-skewers-news-corps-critics-133478 |title='WSJ' Editorial Skewers News Corp.'s Critics |author=Kari Lipschutz |date=18 July 2011 |work=[[Adweek]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Uruguay]], the '''Nostalgia Night''' (Spanish: ''Noche de la Nostalgia'') is celebrated every 24th of August. Every dancing club, broadcasting station and many other events play "nostalgic music" (oldies).

==Overview==
Its origins are somehow disputed. It started in the 24 August 1978. According to José Fernández, owner of the Disco Ton Ton Metek, as every 24 August is the day before Uruguayan Independence Day, a national holiday, once he proposed to Pablo Lecueder (director of the broadcast program Old Hits, in the then [[CX32 Radiomundo]]) to do something in a night that could be commercially profitable.

That same year, the 24 August at night (disputed) in Ton Ton was held the first Nostalgia Night. The night repeated its success and become part of Uruguayan folklore.

Uruguayans are said to be typically nostalgic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.larepublica.com.uy/cultura/53647-el-invento-de-la-nostalgia/|title=The invention of nostalgia |publisher=La República|date=24 August 2001|accessdate=11 July 2013|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Be it for that or for whatever reason, the Nostalgia Night is such a success that it was officially named by the Ministry of Tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www0.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=17825&amp;Anchor=|title=Ley Nº 17.825.

'''The Notre Dame Shakespeare Festival''' (formerly Summer Shakespeare) at the [[University of Notre Dame]] is an annual festival that seeks to combine professional productions of the works of [[William Shakespeare]] with community outreach and educational programs. The Notre Dame Shakespeare Festival is a part of the University of Notre Dame's Shakespeare initiative entitled "Shakespeare at Notre Dame", a program that recognizes the centrality of the study of Shakespeare in humanistic pedagogy at the University. Its fifteenth season (summer of 2014) was known as the 15/150, also celebrating the 450th birthday of William Shakespeare, and the 150th anniversary of the first full production of Shakespeare at the university in 1864&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nd.edu/search/theatre/plays000f.htm|title=Archives of the University of Notre Dame :: Specialized Indexes :: Theatre Chronology|website=archives.nd.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Records indicate the first performance of Shakespeare at the University of Notre Dame took place in 1847, a collection of scenes also from ''Henry IV).'' The anniversary season consisted of the Professional Company production of ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'' (directed by Michael Goldberg), the Young Company performance of ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (directed by West Hyler), and the annual ShakeScenes shows featuring actors of all ages from South Bend and the surrounding community.

== History ==
The Notre Dame Shakespeare Festival, (the professional theatre in residence at the University of Notre Dame), is a direct outgrowth of an experimental course called "Shakespeare in Performance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magazine.nd.edu/news/18270-much-ado-about-shakespeare/|title=Much Ado about Shakespeare // News // Notre Dame Magazine // University of Notre Dame|last=Dame|first=ENR/PAZ // University Communications: Web // University of Notre|website=magazine.nd.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;" created in 1989 by Dr. Paul Rathburn, NDSF's founder. The premise of this course was that Shakespeare's works are both theatrical scripts and literary texts and are illuminated best through work in both the theater and in the classroom. It began in the summer of 2000 with the program's inaugural production, ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', but has since evolved to include guest artists and productions, the ShakeScenes community program, and a Young Company production produced and staffed entirely by Notre Dame and [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's]] students. Following the 2005 production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', Dr. Paul Rathburn retired from his role as Producing Artistic Director. The company's Artistic Director from 2006 - 2012 was Jay Paul Skelton. The current Ryan Producing Artistic Director for the Notre Dame Shakespeare Festival is Grant Mudge. The resident lighting designer for the festival since its inception has been ND Associate Professor [[Kevin Dreyer]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Andrew, "Kevin Dreyer," Spotlights, Arts and Entertainment, South Bend Tribune, August 11, 2011, http://www.nd.edu/~ftt./AE_Aug_11_Dreyer.pdf, Accessed August 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Professional Company Production ==
Arguably the centerpiece of the annual festival, the professional company production consists of a professionally mounted performance of one of the plays of William Shakespeare. The production is always directed and designed by theatrical professionals, typically from either the [[Chicago]] theatre world or the University's own faculty and staff. A number of professional actors are also employed, as well as Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students and South Bend community members. The integration of professional actors and designers with students creates a unique opportunity for those students who wish to pursue theatre as a profession following their graduation.  In recent years, students and professionals from other universities such as [[Ball State University]], the [https://theatre.umn.edu/theatre/bfa University of Minnesota's BFA program] affiliated with the [http://www.guthrietheater.org/ Guthrie Theater], and [[Northwestern University]] have participated in NDSF.

== The Young Company ==
Beginning with 2003's production, the student actors and technicians in the professional company production were given the chance to perform in a production produced entirely by them (though directed by a senior company member). The roles in the Young Company performance are necessarily larger both on and offstage - the professional company's Assistant to the Technical Director may become the Young Company Technical Director, while a student playing First Soldier may have a chance to play [[King Richard III]]. Although in the past Young Company performances have taken place on the same set used for the professional company performance, 2006 saw the introduction of "green shows", performances in which Young Company members traveled to local parks in South Bend and the surrounding community.

== ShakeScenes ==
ShakeScenes is NDSF's community outreach program, employing local theatre troupes and schools to perform selected scenes from Shakespeare's works. The coordinating director for ShakeScenes from its inception until 2012 was Deborah Girasek-Chudzynski of South Bend's [[Stanley Clark School]]. In 2012, the baton was passed to Christy Burgess, the Shakespeare Outreach Program Director at Notre Dame's [http://rclc.nd.edu/ Robinson Community Learning Center]. Participants range in age from 7 to 70, and scene directors are usually educators from local grade schools, high schools, colleges, and directors of area civic theatres. These individuals cast and direct their respective scenes as well as facilitate costumes, props, and choreography. All members of the ShakeScenes company attend acting workshops taught by local and national theatre artists.

'''Outlook Festival''' is a musical event, started as a subsidiary of Leeds event SubDub, hosting all kinds of [[bass music]] held just outside the city of [[Pula]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/21/european-festival-listings The best European festivals 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Although held in Croatia, many of the attendees come from the [[United Kingdom]] as do much of the team involved in organizing the festival. Held in [[Fort Punta Christo]] and the surrounding beaches the festival is unique in its setting, with [[Sound reinforcement system|sound systems]] and stages being erected in various tunnels and even the [[moat]] of the abandoned ruins.

The festival also plays host to a number of [[boat parties]] which feature artists from the festival and sail around the [[Adriatic]] [[coastline]] playing more individual selections of music that other stages around the festival.

The 2011 edition of the festival saw an increase of almost double the capacity and the introduction of a number of new stages. This led to mixed reviews from attendees of the previous festival, some of whom preferred the more intimate setting, however the larger audience allowed festival organisers to book some relatively exclusive artists who perhaps may not have been within the budget otherwise.

Past performers include [[Skream]], [[Benga (musician)|Benga]], [[Digital Mystikz]], [[Johnny Clarke]], [[Pharoahe Monch]], [[Horace Andy]], [[David Rodigan]], [[Jamie xx]], [[Shy FX]], [[Friction (musician)|Friction]], [[Dawn Penn]], [[Iration Steppas]], [[P Money]], [[Plastician]], [[Phi Life Cypher]], [[Phaeleh]], [[Channel One (band)|Channel One]], [[Eksman]], [[Gentleman's Dub Club]], [[Congo Natty]], [[Jehst]] and [[Foreign Beggars]].

The [[UK Festival Awards]] gave Outlook the title of ‘Best Overseas Festival’ in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.festivalawards.com/news1/and-the-winners-are/ ...and the winners are!] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9SwO38G?url=http://uk.festivalawards.com/news1/and-the-winners-are/ |date=2011-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''party plan''' is a method of [[marketing]] products by hosting what is presented as a [[party|social event]] at which products will be offered for sale.  It is a form of [[direct selling]].  The primary system for generating [[sales lead]]s for home party plan sales is the home party itself: the salesperson uses the home party business model as a source for future business by asking attendees if they would like to host selling parties, too.

Direct selling through the party plan typically uses [[multi-level marketing]] (salesperson is paid for selling and for sales made by people he recruits or sponsors) rather than [[single-level marketing]] (salesperson is paid only for the sales he makes himself).&lt;ref name=Abrams&gt;{{cite news

| title = Don't get taken by multi-level marketing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This plan has been used primarily to sell items whose main appeal is to women by women, such as kitchen [[food utensil|utensils]], [[home decor]] items, jewelry, cosmetics, [[handbag]]s, and similar products.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite book

| oclc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent additions to the field include [[lingerie]], wine, and [[Sex toy party|sex toys]].  Sometimes a combination party is held, at which a wide variety of such merchandise is offered for sale.

==How it works==
In this system, representatives of the sales organization, almost invariably women, approach other women about hosting a social event in their homes during which a product will be demonstrated and offered for sale to guests.  In consideration, they will be given hostess gifts and a portion of the proceeds from the amount of goods sold.  Frequently all in attendance will be given a token item of nominal value as an incentive to attend.

At the event, the salesperson displays and demonstrates various products.  She then takes orders from attendees.  The salesperson is almost always paid solely a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] on sales.  If the salesperson has recruited other sales people into the organization, then she also receives a commission based on her recruits' sales.

==History==
The party plan is regarded as primarily the invention of Norman W. Squires, who developed it for Stanley Home Products in Westfield, MA, which company was founded by Stanley Beveridge and Catherine O'Brien in the mid-1930s. Mr. Beveridge and Ms. O'Brien were former employees of the [[Fuller Brush Company]], which sold its products with door-to-door salespersons.

==Criticism==
The party plan is criticized for exploiting social conventions and pressuring "guests" into buying things they do not want.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

[[Handbag|Purse]] parties that are not done through a dedicated program by the manufacturer differ, however, from these other parties in that the merchandise at these parties often consists of counterfeit [[knock-off]]s of popular, name-brand purses.&lt;ref name=Milwaukee /&gt;  Merchandise at American purse parties is usually bought in bulk from [[smuggling|smugglers]] in New York's Chinatown or in [[Garment District (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles' garment district]] and sold to unsuspecting customers at a significantly higher price, although still lower than the retail price of the legitimate product.  These inferior smuggled goods have been linked to [[organized crime]] and the funding of [[terrorism]], so purse parties have become of interest to [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]].  Selling such purses, with an imitation designer label, is a US federal crime called [[trafficking in counterfeit goods]], even if the seller tells the buyer that the purse is a fake.&lt;ref name=Milwaukee&gt;[http://www.wisn.com/r/2191330/detail.html Counterfeit Bags May Have Links To Organized Crime, Terrorism] ''Milwaukee News'' 8 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Potsdam Declaration''' or the '''Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender''' was a statement that called for the [[Surrender of Japan|surrender]] of all [[Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan|Japanese armed forces]] during [[World War II]]. On July 26, 1945, [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], [[United Kingdom]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], and [[President of the Republic of China|Chairman]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Nationalist Government of China]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] issued the document, which outlined the terms of [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] for the [[Empire of Japan]] as agreed upon at the [[Potsdam Conference]]. This [[ultimatum]] stated that, if Japan did not surrender, it would face "prompt and utter destruction".&lt;ref name=atomicarchive&gt;{{cite web | title = Potsdam Declaration: Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender Issued, at Potsdam, July 26, 1945 | url = http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Hiroshima/Potsdam.shtml | publisher = National Science Digital Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = United States Department of State, Office of the Historian | url = https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/potsdam-conf | title = Milestones: 1937-1945 / The Potsdam Conference, 1945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms of the Declaration==
On July 26, the United States, Britain, and China released the Potsdam Declaration announcing the terms for Japan's surrender, with the warning, "We will not deviate from them. There are no alternatives. We shall brook no delay." For Japan, the terms of the declaration specified:&lt;ref name=atomicarchive/&gt;
* the elimination "for all time of the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest";
* the [[Occupation of Japan|occupation of "points in Japanese territory to be designated]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]";
* that the "Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of [[Honshu]], [[Hokkaido]], [[Kyushu]], [[Shikoku]], and such minor islands as we determine", as had been announced in the [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]] in 1943;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/etc/c06.html|title=Potsdam Declaration - Birth of the Constitution of Japan|work=ndl.go.jp|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* that "the Japanese [[Armed forces|military forces]], after being completely disarmed, shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives";
* that "we do not intend that the Japanese shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all [[War crime|war criminals]], including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners".

On the other hand, the declaration offered that:
* "The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. [[Freedom of speech]], [[freedom of religion|of religion]], and [[Freedom of thought|of thought]], as well as respect for the [[Fundamental rights|fundamental]] [[human rights]] shall be established."
* "Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to rearm for war. To this end, access to, as distinguished from control of, raw materials shall be permitted. Eventual Japanese participation in world trade relations shall be permitted."
* "The occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established, in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people, a peacefully inclined and responsible government."

The mention of "[[unconditional surrender]]" came at the end of the declaration:&lt;ref name=atomicarchive/&gt;
* "We call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction."&lt;ref name=atomicarchive/&gt;

Contrary to what had been intended at its conception, which was to disenfranchise the Japanese leadership so the people would accept a mediated transition, instead the declaration made no direct mention of the Emperor at all. It did, however, insist that "the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be eliminated for all time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/etc/c06.html | title = Potsdam Declaration | work = Birth of the Constitution of Japan | publisher = National Diet Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allied intentions on issues of utmost importance to the Japanese, including the extent and number of Allied "occupation points", the fate of Japan's minor islands, and the extent to which the Allies planned to "control" Japan's "raw materials", as well as whether [[Hirohito]] was to be regarded as one of those who had "misled the people of Japan" or whether the Emperor might potentially become part of "a peacefully inclined and responsible government", were thus left unstated, essentially a [[blank check]] for the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Potsdam Declaration|journal=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|year=1966|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "prompt and utter destruction" clause has been interpreted as a veiled warning about American possession of the [[atomic bomb]] which had been [[Trinity (nuclear test)|successfully tested]] in [[New Mexico]] on July 16, 1945, the day before the Potsdam Conference opened. Although the document warned of further destruction like the [[Bombing of Tokyo|''Operation Meetinghouse'' raid on Tokyo]] and [[Air raids on Japan|other carpetbombing of Japanese cities]], it did not mention anything about the atomic bomb.

A major aspect relating to the Potsdam Declaration was that it was intended to be ambiguous. It is not clear from the document itself whether a Japanese government was to remain under Allied occupation or whether the occupation would be run by a foreign military government. In the same manner, it was not clear whether after the end of the occupation Japan was to include any territory other than the four main Japanese islands, i.e., whether the set or sets of islands potentially satisfying the description "such minor islands as [the Allies] determine" included the [[empty set]]. This ambiguity was intentional on the part of the U.S. government in order to allow the Allies a free hand in running the affairs of Japan afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945Berlinv02/d1254 Department of State Memorandum, undated, but certainly from late July 1945, ''FRUS, Conference of Berlin'', vol. 2, doc. 1254]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaflets and radio broadcasts==
The Declaration was released to the press in Potsdam on the evening of July 26 and simultaneously transmitted to the [[Office of War Information]] (OWI) in Washington.  By 5&amp;nbsp;p.m. Washington time, OWI's West Coast transmitters, aimed at the Japanese home islands, were broadcasting the text in English, and two hours later began broadcasting it in Japanese. Simultaneously, American bombers dropped over 3 million leaflets describing the declaration over Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Information War in the Pacific, 1945: Paths to Peace|author=Williams, Josette H.|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol46no3/article07.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration was never transmitted to the Japanese government through diplomatic channels.&lt;ref name="Hellegers-2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hellegers|first=Dale M. |title=We, the Japanese People: Washington |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GL8h6wZPqIoC&amp;pg=PA134 |year=2001 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-8032-2 |page=134 |oclc=47238424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although picking up enemy propaganda leaflets and listening to foreign radio broadcasts (in Japan) was illegal, the American propaganda efforts were successful in making the key points of the declaration known to most Japanese.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Aftermath==
{{main|Surrender of Japan}}

The terms of the declaration were hotly debated within the Japanese government. Upon receiving the declaration, Foreign Minister [[Shigenori Tōgō]] hurriedly met with Prime Minister [[Kantarō Suzuki]] and Cabinet Secretary [[Hisatsune Sakomizu]]. Sakomizu recalled that all felt the declaration must be accepted. Despite being sympathetic to accepting the terms, Tōgō felt it was vague concerning the eventual form of government for Japan, disarmament, and the fate of accused war criminals, and still had hope that the [[Soviet Union]] would agree to mediate negotiations with the Western Allies to obtain clarifications and revisions of the declaration's terms. Shortly afterwards, Tōgō met with Emperor [[Hirohito]], and advised him to treat the declaration with the utmost circumspection, but that a reply should be postponed until the Soviet response to the Japanese request to mediate peace. Hirohito stated that the declaration was "acceptable in principle". Meanwhile, the Supreme Council for the Direction of the War met the same day to discuss the declaration. War Minister [[Korechika Anami]], General [[Yoshijirō Umezu]], and Admiral [[Teijirō Toyoda]] opposed accepting the declaration, arguing that the terms were "too dishonorable", and advised that the Japanese government openly reject it. Suzuki, Tōgō, and Admiral [[Mitsumasa Yonai]] leaned towards accepting it, but agreed that clarification was needed over the status of the Emperor. Tōgō's suggestion that the government not respond until it received the Soviet response was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Wainstock, Dennis: ''The Decision to Drop the Atomic Bomb'', p. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

At a press conference with the Japanese press in Tokyo, Suzuki stated that the Japanese policy towards the declaration would be one of {{nihongo||黙殺|[[mokusatsu]]|lit. "killing with silence"}}, which the United States interpreted as meaning "rejection by ignoring", leading to a decision by the White House to carry out the threat of destruction.&lt;ref name=Kawai&gt;"Mokusatsu, Japan's Response to the Potsdam Declaration", Kazuo Kawai, ''Pacific Historical Review'', Vol. 19, No. 4 (November 1950), pp. 409–414.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the White House decision, the [[United States Army Air Forces]] dropped the [[Little Boy|first atomic bomb]] on the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945, and then the [[Fat Man|second atomic bomb]] on the Japanese city of [[Nagasaki]] three days later on August 9, 1945. These two bombings devastated the two cities, killing an estimated 129,000–246,000 people and destroying much of the cities' infrastructure as well as [[military base]]s and [[war]] [[Industry|industries]] in a matter of seconds in a radius that stretched for more than 1 mile (1.6 kilometers).

However, the word ''mokusatsu'' can also mean "withholding comment".&lt;ref name=Kawai /&gt; Since World War II, it has been alleged that the [[bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] were attributable to English translations of ''mokusatsu'' having misrepresented Suzuki as rejecting the terms of the Potsdam Declaration;&lt;ref name=Zanettin&gt;Federico Zanettin,  [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13556509.2016.1149754  ‘The deadliest error’: translation, international relations and the news media]   The Translator   Volume 22, 2016 - Issue 3 pp 303-318.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Polizzotti1&gt;Mark Polizzotti,   [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/opinion/sunday/why-mistranslation-matters.html 'Why Mistranslation Matters,'] [[New York Times]] 28 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; however, this claim is not universally accepted.&lt;ref name=chalmers1980&gt;[[Chalmers Johnson]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/132001 'Omote (Explicit) and Ura Implicit):Translating Japanese Political Terms,'] [[The Journal of Japanese Studies]], Vol. 6, No. 1 (Winter, 1980), pp. 89-115&lt;/ref&gt;

In a widely broadcast speech after the bombing of Hiroshima, which was picked up by Japanese news agencies, President Truman warned that if Japan failed to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration it could "expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=United States Department of State |title=Foreign Relations of the United States: diplomatic papers: the Conference of Berlin (the Potsdam Conference)|year=1945|volume=2|pages=1376–1377 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |series=Foreign Relations of the United States |url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/FRUS.FRUS1945Berlinv02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Prime Minister [[Kantarō Suzuki|Suzuki]] felt compelled to meet the Japanese press, to whom he reiterated his government's commitment to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Walter |last=Scoenberger | title = Decision of Destiny | location = Columbus | publisher = Ohio University Press | year=1969 | pages =248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of the Allies' demands brought home to the Japanese leaders and people the extent of the success Japan's enemies had achieved in the war.&lt;ref name="Rhodes-1976"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rhodes |first=Anthony Richard Ewart |title=Propaganda: The Art of Persuasion: World War II |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CuZOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA262 |edition=2, illustrated |year=1976 |publisher=Chelsea House |isbn=978-0-87754-029-8 |page=262 |oclc=1500305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the receipt of the Potsdam Declaration, the Japanese Government attempted to maintain the issue of the Emperor's administrative prerogative within the Potsdam Declaration through its surrender offer of August 10, but in the end had to take comfort with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]]' reply "From the moment of surrender the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied powers who will take such steps as he deems proper to effectuate the surrender terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Japanese Surrender Documents - WWII|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1945/450729a.html|website=Ibiblio.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, at 1200 JST on August 15, 1945, the Emperor announced his acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration, which culminated in the surrender documents signature on board the {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} on September 2, 1945. The radio announcement to the Japanese people was the first time many of them had actually [[Jewel Voice Broadcast|heard the voice]] of the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, Rinehart and Winston, American Anthem textbook, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 1945, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], based on a secret agreement at the [[Yalta Conference]] in February, unilaterally abrogated the USSR's [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|Neutrality Treaty with Japan]] (1941) and declared war on Japan on August 9, 1945, beginning the [[Soviet–Japanese War]]. The Soviets [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]] on three fronts. 

The Potsdam Declaration was intended from the start to serve as legal basis for handling Japan after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945Berlinv02/d1254 Department of State Memorandum, undated, but certainly from late July 1945, ''FRUS, Conference of Berlin'', vol. 2, doc. 1254]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |date=November 2016 |reason= Please provide a quote which supports those text.}} Following the surrender of the Japanese government and the landing of General McArthur in Japan in September 1945, the Potsdam Declaration served as legal basis{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2016}} for occupation reforms.

[[File:Quick Step dance pattern.png|thumb|right|250px|"Quick Step" dance [[rhythm]] figure.&lt;ref name="Blatter"&gt;Blatter, Alfred (2007). ''Revisiting Music Theory: A Guide to the Practice'', p.28. {{ISBN|0-415-97440-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''quickstep''' is a light-hearted [[dance]] of the standard [[ballroom dance]]s. The movement of the dance is fast and powerfully flowing and sprinkled with [[syncopation]]s. The upbeat [[melodies]] that quickstep is danced to make it suitable for both formal and informal events. Quickstep was developed in the 1920s in [[New York City]] and was first danced by Caribbean and African dancers. Its origins are in combination of slow [[foxtrot]] combined with the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]], a dance which was one of the precursors to what today is called [[swing dancing]].

==History==
The quickstep evolved in the 1920s from a combination of the [[foxtrot]], [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]], [[Collegiate shag (dance)|shag]], [[Peabody (dance)|peabody]], and [[One-Step|one-step]]. The dance is English in origin and was standardized in 1927. While it evolved from the foxtrot, the quickstep now is quite separate. Unlike the modern foxtrot, the man often closes his feet, and [[syncopated step]]s are regular occurrences (as was the case in early foxtrot). Three characteristic dance figures of the quickstep are the [[chassé]]s, where the feet are brought together, the [[quarter turns]], and the [[Lock step (dance move)|lock step]].&lt;ref name=VS&gt;Silvester, Victor 1982. ''Modern ballroom dancing: history and practice''. Paul, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p126&lt;/sup&gt;

This dance gradually evolved into a very dynamic one with a lot of movement on the dance floor, with many advanced patterns including hops, runs, quick steps with a lot of momentum, and rotation. The tempo of quickstep dance is rather brisk, as it was developed to [[ragtime]] era [[jazz]] music, which is fast-paced when compared to other dance music.

By the end of the 20th century the complexity of quickstep as done by advanced dancers had increased, with the extensive use of syncopated steps with [[eighth note]] durations. While in older times quickstep patterns were counted with "quick" (one beat) and "slow" (two beats) steps, many advanced patterns today are cued with split beats, such as "quick-and-quick-and-quick, quick, slow", with there being further steps on the 'and's.

==Style==
The quickstep is elegant like the [[foxtrot]] and should be smooth and glamorous. The dancers should appear to be very light on their feet. It is very energetic and form-intensive.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}}
The quickstep is danced to 4/4 music of 48-52 measures per minute.&lt;ref name=BallroomGuide&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballroom Guide - Dance Music!|url=http://ballroomguide.com/resources/music.html|website=Ballroom Guide|publisher=Ballroom Guide|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syllabus==
The two [[International Style (dance)|International Style]] syllabi of [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]] and [[IDTA]] for quickstep differ very little.

The [[American Style]] [[dance competition]] program does not include quickstep, but a limited version of the dance is taught and [[social dance|danced socially]] in some American dance venues.

The '''Red Earth Festival''' is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultural festival that takes places every June in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], United States. '''Red Earth, Inc.''' is the nonprofit organization that hosts the festival and maintained the '''Red Earth Art Center''', which houses temporary exhibits and a permanent collection of [[Native American art]] in downtown Oklahoma City.

==History==
Red Earth, Inc., was founded in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=RE003|title=Red Earth Festival|last=Bates|first=Richenda Davis|date=|website=The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; when art advocates planned a Native art market and [[powwow]]. The organization grew out of the Native-run Center of the American Indian, a cultural center and art museum founded in 1978. The two groups merged in 1992 to create Red Earth.

==Festival==
The festival is a multi-day event beginning with a parade through downtown Oklahoma City. It features an art market open to Native American members of [[federally recognized tribes|federal]] and [[state recognized tribes]]. The festival also features nonprofit and educational booths, [[gourd dance|gourd dancing]], and a powwow. Typically it takes place in the [[Cox Convention Center]].

'''''The Star Wars Holiday Special''''' is a 1978 American [[Musical film|musical]] [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[television film]] set in the [[Star Wars galaxy|''Star Wars'' galaxy]]. It stars [[Star Wars (film)|the original film]]'s main cast, [[Chewbacca]]'s family, and introduces [[Boba Fett]], who would appear in later films. It is the first official ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film and was directed by [[Steve Binder]].

In the storyline that ties the special together, following the events of the original film, Chewbacca and [[Han Solo]] attempt to visit [[Kashyyyk|the Wookiee home world]] to celebrate "Life Day". They are pursued by agents of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], who are searching for members of the [[Rebel Alliance]] on the planet. The special introduces three members of Chewbacca's family: his father Itchy, his wife [[Chewbacca#Expanded Universe|Malla]], and his son [[Lumpawarrump|Lumpy]].

The program also features the rest of the main ''Star Wars'' characters, including [[Luke Skywalker]], [[C-3PO]], [[R2-D2]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[Princess Leia]], all portrayed by the original cast. The program includes footage from the 1977 film, and a [[Animated cartoon|cartoon]] produced by [[Toronto]]-based [[Nelvana]] featuring the [[bounty hunter]] Boba Fett. A few scenes take place in space and in spacecraft including the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and a [[Star Destroyer]]. The variety show segments and cartoon also take place in a few other locales, such as the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina seen in the original film, and a newly introduced red [[ocean planet]] known as Panna.

The special is notorious for its extremely negative reception and has never been rebroadcast or officially released on home video.&lt;ref name="abc1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[ABC News]]|title=Holiday Specials Gone Bad; The 'Star Wars Holiday Special' Flop Lives On|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=4034365&amp;page=1|date=December 20, 2007|first=John|last=Berman|author2=Ted Gerstein|accessdate=October 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hofstede&gt;{{cite book|author=David Hofstede|title=What Were They Thinking? The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History|publisher=Back Stage Books|year=2004|pages=204–206|isbn=0-8230-8441-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has, therefore, become something of a cultural legend, because of the [[Underground film|underground]] quality of its existence.

On Life Day, Chewbacca, accompanied by Han Solo, is headed home to see his family. Along the way, the duo are chased by two [[Star Destroyer]]s, but they escape into [[Hyperspace (science fiction)#Star Wars|hyperspace]].

Meanwhile, on [[Kashyyyk]], Chewbacca's family is preparing for his return. Hoping to find the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', his wife, Malla, runs a computer scan for starships in the area but is unsuccessful. Malla contacts [[Luke Skywalker]], who, along with [[R2-D2]], is working on his [[X-wing]] starfighter. Luke tells her that he does not know what happened. Malla contacts Saun Dann, a local human trader. He tells her through a carefully worded message that Han and Chewbacca are on their way and should be arriving soon. Malla then attempts (unsuccessfully) to prepare a meal, the instructions of which are being aired via a local cooking show by an eccentric four-armed alien cook, Chef Gormaanda ([[Harvey Korman]]).

Saun arrives with Life Day gifts for everyone, including a virtual reality fantasy program (featuring [[Diahann Carroll]]) for Itchy. Back on the ''Falcon'', Chewbacca and Han have just come out of hyperspace not far from Kashyyyk. Han notices an increased Imperial presence, so they decide to land in an unguarded area to the north. As they enter the atmosphere, Lumpy hears the roaring of the ship. Believing Han and Chewie might be arriving, Malla opens the door, but instead finds two [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]] and officers.

The Imperials force their way into the house. An officer orders a search for Chewbacca. As they search, Saun and the others attempt to distract them with food and Malla's music video box (which features a video by [[Jefferson Starship]]). When the music finishes, the head officer orders the search to continue. The head officer tells Malla to keep Lumpy busy while they search his room, so Lumpy (and the viewing audience) watches a [[Animated cartoon|cartoon]] on a viewscreen of one of his father's many adventures:

:During a search for a [[talisman]], the ''Millennium Falcon'' crashes on the water planet of Panna. Upon landing, they run into [[Boba Fett]], who claims to want to help them after saving Luke from a giant monster that attacks him from behind. They all board the ''Falcon'', where Han has been infected by a mysterious sleeping virus caused by the talisman. Luke then contracts the virus as well.

:Fett and Chewie go into Panna City to get the cure. Once they get into the Imperial-occupied city, Fett instructs Chewie to stay behind while he gets the cure, and contacts [[Darth Vader]]. On the ''Falcon'', as C-3PO is caring for Han and Luke, R2-D2 intercepts the call between Vader and Fett, causing worry for C-3PO. Evading the Imperials, Fett and Chewie return to the ''Falcon'' with the cure. After everyone recovers from the virus, they learn of Fett's true allegiances. Fett blasts away in his jetpack, promising that they'll meet again. Everyone then escapes from the planet and back to the Rebel base aboard the ''Falcon''.

When the cartoon finishes, Lumpy works to create a translation device from his Amorphian machine that will fool the Imperials into returning to their base by faking their commander's voice. To do so, he first must watch the manual for the device, being presented by a malfunctioning, incompetent robot (also played by Korman).

While the Imperials are searching downstairs, the living room viewscreen activates, announcing that [[Tatooine]] is now being put under curfew by the Empire, because of "[[subversion|subversive]] forces". The video is announced as required viewing for all Imperial forces and much of it features Ackmena ([[Bea Arthur]]) running the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina. Ackmena is approached by an admirer: Krelman, an amorous alien, who has misunderstood something she said to him recently. When the Empire announces the curfew, Ackmena announces [[Last call (bar term)|last call]], and when she is ignored, sings "Good Night, But Not Goodbye".

Lumpy uses this opportunity to put his plan into motion, faking a repeated call for the Imperials to "return to base." They leave, but one stormtrooper stays behind and realizes they were tricked. He finds Lumpy and destroys the machine, then chases Lumpy outside.

As they both run onto the deck, Han and Chewbacca arrive. Chewie protects Lumpy as Han dispatches the stormtrooper. After they are reunited, an Imperial officer appears on the viewscreen, giving a general alert for the missing stormtrooper. Saun quickly responds that the trooper stole supplies and deserted. The danger averted, the family prepares to go to the festival at the great [[Tree of life|Tree of Life]]. They hold glowing orbs, and appear in space wearing red robes.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-star-wars-holiday-special-20181117-story.html|title=‘The Star Wars Holiday Special’ aired only once. 40 years later, it’s still weird|last=Roy|first=Jessica|date=November 17, 2018|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wookiees walk into a bright star and arrive at the Tree of Life, where many are gathered, including C-3PO and R2-D2. Luke, Leia, and Han also appear. Leia gives a short speech and sings a song in celebration. Chewie remembers his adventures during the events of the original film. Finally, the Wookiee family sits around a table and bows their heads.

[[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]], who played {{nowrap|[[R2-D2]]}} in the films, was not involved in the special. The droid was performed entirely by a radio-controlled unit, operated by [[Mick Garris]] (Lucas's receptionist). In the credits, R2-D2 is credited by announcer [[Art James]] as playing himself.

Because James Earl Jones was originally uncredited in ''Star Wars'', the special marked the first time he was credited as the voice of Darth Vader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/2027329002|title=Remembering that infamously bad 'Star Wars' holiday special, 40 years later|last=McKairnes|first=Jim|date=November 19, 2018|website=USA Today|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
While outlining the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and planning its potential sequels, Lucas imagined a "film just about Wookiees, nothing else."&lt;ref&gt;Steranko, "George Lucas", ''Prevue'' #42, September–October 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; After the original film's success, its cast made a few appearances on TV [[variety show]]s.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; According to Charles Lippincott, who was head of marketing of [[the Star Wars Corporation]], [[CBS]] brought the idea of doing a TV special to him and Lucas, although there is some internal dispute about this claim.&lt;ref name=WeirdTV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2008/12/star_wars_special200812|title=The Han Solo Comedy Hour!|last=Digiacomo|first=Frank|date=December 2008|website=Vanity Fair|accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to J.W. Rinzler, "Everybody agreed that a television special was a good idea." Lucas was busy moving his production company to a new location, which was not heavily involved in the special. Though Lucas is uncredited, it was his idea to build the narrative around Chewbacca's family.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

CBS hired experienced variety show writers and producers.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Writer [[Bruce Vilanch]] was concerned about the decision to center the special on a species who grunt in a fictional language without subtitles, and feared that the special would turn into "one long episode of ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]''." Regardless, Lucas would not budge on his vision.&lt;ref name=WeirdTV/&gt; The special went through two directors. The first, David Acomba, was brought in through an attempt to "make us different in variety shows", according to  Lippencott. Acomba, a classmate of George Lucas at [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|USC film school]], was unfamiliar with a [[multiple-camera setup]], which caused some problems. Acomba also felt that there was a divide between himself and the producers, and chose to leave the project after finishing only a few scenes, including the cantina and Jefferson Starship. He was replaced by [[Steve Binder]], whose only contact with [[Lucasfilm]] was a "Wookiee [[Bible (screenwriting)|bible]]" detailing how the species should look and behave.&lt;ref name=WeirdTV/&gt; [[Stan Winston]] was hired to design the Wookiee family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/72863/dark-side-oral-history-star-wars-holiday-special|title=The Dark Side: An Oral History of The Star Wars Holiday Special|last=Rossen|first=Jake|website=Mental Floss|date=December 3, 2017|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special was broadcast in its entirety in the United States only once, on Friday, November 17, 1978 (the week before [[Thanksgiving]]), on the television network [[CBS]] from 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm to 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm, [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] (EST), pre-empting ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' and ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]''. It was also broadcast on the Canadian television network [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] from 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm to 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm, Eastern Standard Time.&lt;ref name="abc1"/&gt;, in [[New Zealand]] on [[TVNZ]], and in Australia on the [[Seven Network]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Reception==
The ''Star Wars Holiday Special'' has become notorious for its extremely negative reception, both by ''Star Wars'' fans and the general public.&lt;ref name="abc1"/&gt; [[Anthony Daniels]], in a documentary promoting the worldwide tour of ''Star Wars: In Concert'', notes with a laugh that the ''Star Wars'' universe includes "The horrible ''Holiday Special'' that nobody talks about". [[Nathan Rabin]] of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote, "I'm not convinced the special wasn’t ultimately written and directed by a sentient bag of [[cocaine]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Star Wars Holiday Special Was the Worst Thing on Television|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-star-studded-star-wars-holiday-special-was-the-worst-thing-on-television-ever|last=Pasternack|first=Alex|date=December 24, 2014|publisher=Vice|work=Motherboard|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Lucas]] did not have significant involvement with the film's production and was reportedly unhappy with the results; however, [[Patty Maloney]], who played Lumpy, stated in 2008 that Lucas was sent [[dailies]] of each day's shooting for approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kirkwood, SKot|date=November 8, 2008|url=http://www.starwarsholidayspecial.com/text/patty_maloney.htm|title=Interview with Patty Maloney, 'Lumpy'|publisher=The Star Wars Holiday Special|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Hofstede, author of ''What Were They Thinking?: The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History'', ranked the holiday special at number one, calling it "the worst two hours of television ever".&lt;ref name=Hofstede/&gt; [[Shepard Smith]], a news anchor for the [[Fox News Channel]], referred to it as a "'70s train wreck, combining the worst of ''Star Wars'' with the utter worst of [[variety television]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jppgzd/a-star-wars-holiday-special-you-were-not-supposed-to-see-this|title=In Praise of The Ominous Star Wars Holiday Special|last=Pasternack|first=Alex|date=December 25, 2010|publisher=Vice|work=Motherboard|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[review-aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film received a 33% approval rating, based on nine reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 3.5/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_holiday_special |title=Star Wars: Holiday Special (1978) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=May 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Segments==
All the acts were loosely linked together with material which involves the Wookiees' preparation for Life Day on [[Kashyyyk]], Han and Chewie's attempt to bypass the Imperial blockade and make it to Chewie's family, and the Imperial garrison's search for rebels. The plot strings together a series of musical numbers, celebrity [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] and other variety show acts. These include songs and comedy routines by such 1970s talents as [[Jefferson Starship]], [[Diahann Carroll]], [[Art Carney]], [[Harvey Korman]] and [[Bea Arthur]], and a circus-style [[acrobatics]] routine including [[uneven bars]] and [[juggling]]. The most notable segment is an animated cartoon featuring the onscreen debut of [[Boba Fett]].

===Music===
Original music was composed for ''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' by Ken and Mitzie Welch, while Ian Fraser was brought in to adapt [[John Williams]]' orchestral themes from ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name=WeirdTV /&gt; The special features four songs:
# "This Minute Now" is sung by [[Diahann Carroll]]. Carroll – who is supposed to be an image created by a [[virtual reality]] machine – tells Chewbacca's father, Itchy, that she is his "fantasy" and suggestively invites him to "experience" her.
# "Light the Sky on Fire", performed by [[Jefferson Starship]], which is presented as a [[3-D film|3D]] music video watched by one of the Imperial guards; during production the song was given the working title "Cigar-Shaped Object (Vanished Without a Trace)" (the song was included as a bonus 45 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] single in the Jefferson Starship greatest hits collection ''[[Gold (Jefferson Starship album)|Gold]]''). (The clip marked [[Marty Balin]]'s final appearance with Jefferson Starship, as he had left the band in October 1978, a month before the special was broadcast. He later rejoined the band in 1993.)
# Later, [[Bea Arthur]], who plays a bartender in the [[Mos Eisley]] [[cantina]], sings "Good Night, But Not Goodbye" set to the "Cantina Band" theme. Some of the same aliens seen in the cantina in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' reappear, including the band [[Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes]], as back-up musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzXKySxPFCI|title=Bea Arthur sings in the Star Wars Holiday Special|date=July 11, 2006|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Finally, at the end of the special, [[Carrie Fisher]] sings a song in celebration of [[Life Day]] to the tune of the ''Star Wars'' main theme by [[John Williams]].

===Comedy===
[[Harvey Korman]] provides comedy in three of the special's skits, including the cantina skit with Bea Arthur where he plays a barfly who drinks through a hole in the top of his head. He also performs two solo routines: one as Chef Gormanda, a four-armed parody of [[Julia Child]] (the four arms allow her to work much faster than [[Mallatobuck|Malla]] can keep up with) and one as a malfunctioning Amorphian [[android (robot)|android]] in an instruction video watched by [[Chewbacca#Expanded Universe|Lumpy]]. Art Carney has a more integral role in the story, playing a trader named Saun Dann on [[Kashyyyk]] who is a member of the rebellion and helps Chewie's family. His segments are also largely played for laughs and at one point includes a scene alluding to his character Ed Norton from ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', where an Imperial officer demands that he "get on with it" while Carney dallies with a prop, thus introducing the Jefferson Starship performance.

The cartoon introduces [[Boba Fett]], whose appearance was based on footage of the unpainted costume from ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and according to Nelvana co-founder [[Clive A.

==Versions and availability==
''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' was mostly forgotten after its only airing in 1978, until some time in the early-to-mid-1990s when individuals came forward and offered original videotape recordings of the TV airing. These have since been duplicated and reduplicated so that most copies of the special available today are based on second- to sixth-generation VHS dubs. Some of these fan-made copies include the original commercials that aired during the show, as well as the news breaks; the most notable news item was the sentencing of [[William Kampiles]]. One such recording from [[WCBS-TV]] in [[New York City]] featured anchor [[Rolland Smith]] teasing a story on "fighting the frizzies" for that night's 11 p.m. news, an ID which itself has gained popularity over the years on the Internet and television shows such as ''[[South Park]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwarsholidayspecial.com/multimedia.htm|title=Holiday Special Multimedia|publisher=The Star Wars Holiday Special|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It soon became a [[cult classic]] among ''Star Wars'' fans. While originally shared or sold as a [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] video at conventions or via outlets such as [[eBay]], [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] networks have made the special more widely available to fans curious to see it for themselves.&lt;ref name="abc1"/&gt; Online video sites such as YouTube have also hosted clips of the special. However, the special has not been officially released. The so-called "Platinum Edition" DVD mentioned in a review by [[Lawrence Person]] on Locus Online was an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Locus Online |url=http://locusmag.com/2005/Features/0401_StarWarsDVD.html |title=DVD review of The Star Wars Holiday Special}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animation cels sold in the mid-1990s came from the special's animated Boba Fett segment. Segments of that cartoon appear in the 2002 ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' web documentary "Bucket Head" and [[Jeremy Bulloch]], who portrayed Fett in the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original films]], introduces the segment as coming from the ''Holiday Special''. In 2004, the official ''Star Wars'' site confirmed that documentary filmmaker [[Kevin Burns]] was allowed access to the original print for use in his ''[[Empire of Dreams]]'' documentary; however, the segment using footage from the holiday special was ultimately left out of the final cut.

The entire Fett cartoon would get an official home video release as an [[Easter Egg (media)|Easter Egg]] on the 2011 ''Star Wars: the Complete Saga'' [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] set and therefore the only portion of the Holiday Special officially released in any home video format.

===International distribution===
The program was seen in Canada on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] on the [[simsub|same evening as the CBS broadcast]]. [[Toronto]] CTV station [[CFTO-DT|CFTO-TV]] aired the program at 7&amp;nbsp;pm, an hour earlier than seen on the nearest American outlet, [[WIVB-TV]] in [[Buffalo, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Star Wars special reunites cast on planet of Kazzook |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  | date=17 November 1978 | page=18 | author=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also distributed and seen in Australia and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} It was shown on Swedish [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] on May 31, 1979 as ''Stjärnornas krig - och fred'' (literally "Star Wars - and Peace", a pun on the Swedish title of the first film).&lt;ref&gt;[http://smdb.kb.se/catalog/search?q=%22stj%C3%A4rnornas+krig+och+fred%22+typ%3Atv+datum%3A1978-2013&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 "Stjärnornas krig och fred"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911143444/http://smdb.kb.se/catalog/search?q=%22stj%C3%A4rnornas%20krig%20och%20fred%22%20typ%3Atv%20datum%3A1978-2013&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |date=September 11, 2016 }}.

==Role in greater ''Star Wars'' continuity==
===Canonicity of the special===
{{See also|Star Wars expanded to other media#Holocron database and canonicity}}
Despite the unpopularity of the special, [[Lucasfilm]] maintained its status as part of the continuity, placing it halfway between Episodes ''IV'' and ''V''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=152583&amp;start=0870|title=Star Wars: Message Boards: Holocron continuity database questions|last=Chee|first=Leland|website=StarWars.com|date=October 12, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080610163311/http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=152583&amp;start=0870|archivedate=June 10, 2008|accessdate=November 17, 2018|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1978 to 2014, most elements of ''Holiday Special'' fell under the [[Star Wars expanded to other media#Holocron database and canonicity|S-canon]], a secondary level of canon superseded by other licensed works.

This was clarified in 2007 by Leland Chee, who maintains Lucasfilm's internal continuity database called "the Holocron". According to Chee, the Holocron contained at least 28 entries about ''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' by that point. These placed all elements referred to in other works, such as Life Day and Chewbacca's family members, in the {{nowrap|C-canon}}. He stated that elements not subsequently referred to were given the lower rank of {{nowrap|S-canon}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=152583&amp;start=870|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115064750/http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=152583&amp;start=870|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 15, 2006|title=Holocron continuity database question|last=Chee|first=Leland|website=StarWars.com|date=October 4, 2006|accessdate=October 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chee also confirmed that [[Leslie Schofield]] appears as an unnamed character in ''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' and not the character he played in ''A New Hope'' named [[Chief Bast]]. Previously this confusion had caused fans (drawing on a hint in the ''[[Star Wars Customizable Card Game|Customizable Card Game]]'') to question whether Bast's death aboard the Death Star was genuine.

After Lucasfilm was acquired by [[The Walt Disney Company]], the Holocron was retired. Only the episodic films and animated series beginning with ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'' were declared to be part of the new canon. However, {{nowrap|J. J.}} Abrams sarcastically referred to ''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' as canon in a 2015 interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2230940/j-j-abrams-star-wars-the-force-awakens-yes-no/|title=J.

===Later appearances===
After being introduced by the special, the character [[Boba Fett]] and the planet [[Kashyyyk]] have gone on to play integral roles in the franchise, making their first film appearances in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'', respectively. Apart from this, more specific references to ''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' have been made including:
* In 1979, one year after the special's broadcast, [[Lucasfilm]] published ''Star Wars: The Wookiee Storybook'', a children's storybook which reunited characters from the special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Wars FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Trilogy That Changed the Movies|last=Clark|first=Mark|page=172|year=2015|publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books|isbn=978-1480360181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[The Unifying Force]]'' (2003, {{ISBN|9780345428523}}) is the final book of the ''[[The New Jedi Order|New Jedi Order]]'' series. It features Lumpy, who takes up Chewbacca's life debt to Han.
* ''[[Star Wars: Galaxies]]'' (2003) was a popular [[MMORPG]] that allowed the player to visit and explore Kashyyyk. While there, the player can explore the customs of Life Day, as there are several Wookiees dressed in red robes, as in the special. Lumpy's stuffed [[bantha]] from the special can also be seen in the game. The official site for ''Star Wars: Galaxies'' even had a webpage dedicated to explaining these features in the game and the customs of Life Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Star Wars Galaxies |url=http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/content.jsp?page=Wookiee%20Life%20Day |title=Wookiee Life Day |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051020072824/http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/content.jsp?page=Wookiee%20Life%20Day |archivedate=October 20, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[A Forest Apart]]'' (2003) is an e-book by [[Troy Denning]], also released in print as a supplement to his book ''[[Tatooine Ghost]]''.

* ''[[List of Star Wars Books#Visual dictionaries|The Visual Dictionary of Star Wars, Episode III]]'' (2005, {{ISBN|9780756611286}}) explains that the gunner of one of the ''Oevvaor'' jet [[catamaran]]s in the film was Itchy.
* ''Star Wars: Complete Locations'' (2005, {{ISBN|9781465452726}}) mentions that while Luke, Obi-Wan and the droids are in the cantina in ''Star Wars'', Ackmena is in a nearby room negotiating for a raise in her pay.
* ''HoloNet News'' (2005) featured an issue about Chef Gormaanda. Featuring a new recipe, it was explained that she had won a cooking award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holonetnews.com/50/life/1344_2.html "Life" section] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124062124/http://www.holonetnews.com/50/life/1344_2.html |date=November 24, 2005 }}, ''HoloNet News'' Volume 531 No. 50 13:4:4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Street Parade''' is the most attended{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[technoparade]] in the world, since the [[Love Parade stampede|end of Love Parade 2010]]. It takes place in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] and is the largest annual event in Zurich. Officially a demonstration for freedom, love and tolerance attended by up to a one million people, it proceeds along the side of [[Lake Zurich]] on the second Saturday of August.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
*'''1992 — participants: 1,000'''&lt;br /&gt;The first Street Parade (the [[English language|English]] name is used in [[German language|German]]) took place on September 5, 1992, initiated by student Marek Krynski and officially called the Demonstration for Love, Peace, Liberty, Generosity and Tolerance ({{lang-de|Demonstration für Liebe, Frieden, Freiheit, Grosszügigkeit und Toleranz}}). About 1,000 took part in dancing behind two [[Lovemobile]]s.

*'''1993 — participants: 10,000 — temp: 27&amp;nbsp;°C'''&lt;br /&gt;In only its second year, 10,000 [[rave]]rs participated.
*'''1994 — participants: 20,000'''&lt;br /&gt;The parade was nearly banned by the head of the police department Robert Neukomm (Socialist Party) and Monika Stocker (Green Party), but strong protests from the media, the population and the techno music scene forced the city to back down. Since then the parade takes place every August with a lengthened route around the corner of Lake Zurich. The first compilation was published that year: ''Energy 94 Streetparade - The Disc.''
*'''1995 — participants: 150,000 — temp: 24&amp;nbsp;°C'''&lt;br /&gt;As many as 150,000 Swiss and foreign ravers come to the Street Parade. The double-disc ''Street Parade 95'' is the first dedicated release.
*'''1996 — participants: 350,000 — motto: The Rave-olution continues'''&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, the Street Parade is organized by its own dedicated Association, founded by Marek Krynski, Barbara Suter and Christoph Soltmannowski. The official logo of the Street Parade is conceived: a stylized "P" inside a rounded red star.
*'''1997 — participants: 475,000 — temp: 27&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Climb &amp; Dance'''
*'''1998 — participants: 450,000 — temp: 28&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: It's All In Your Hands'''&lt;br /&gt;The Street Parade can be first heard in a live CD, directly recorded on a Lovemobile. As music plays, the crowds are heard cheering and celebrating in the background. In this way the disc uniquely portrays the voice of the Street Parade.
*'''1999 — participants: 550,000 — temp: 30&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: More than Words'''&lt;br /&gt;Radio Street Parade goes on the air for about two weeks prior to and about a week following the Street Parade. Radio Street Parade broadcasts techno music, electronica and dance, interviews with DJs and musicians as well as reports about the Street Parade.
*'''2000 — participants: 750,000 — temp: 32&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Believe in Love'''&lt;br /&gt;The Street Parade is for the first time broadcast live on Swiss television SF1, 3sat and Tele 24. The German music television [[Viva (TV station)|VIVA]] showed two-hour summaries in the following week.
*'''2001 — participants: 1,000,000 — temp: 21&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Love, Freedom, Tolerance'''&lt;br /&gt;The event reaches record heights with one million participating ravers. The Zurich Street Parade came out of the shadow of the Berlin Love Parade.
*'''2002 — participants: 650,000 — temp: 17&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Peace!'''&lt;br /&gt;Rain dampens success of the event.
*'''2003 — participants: 900,000 — temp: 37&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Let the Sun Shine'''&lt;br /&gt;Very hot weather with partly clouded sky. Attendance slightly down to an estimated 900,000. However, this contrasts to far more drastic declines in the Berlin event. The direction of the route was reversed in this year in order to reduce noise levels on certain streets, and to provide better exits for the trucks.
*'''2004 — participants: 1,000,000 — temp: 37&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Elements of Culture'''&lt;br /&gt;The Street Parade again reaches a 1,000,000-person count.
*'''2005 — participants: 1,000,000 — temp: 23&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Today is Tomorrow'''&lt;br /&gt;A million [[rave]]rs and visitors are officially cited once again. The Street Parade Radio ran into some financial difficulties, but was rescued by the Zurich local radio station [[Energy Zürich]] and the free newspaper [[20 Minuten]]. Beer was for the first time available at official drink stands. It was perceived by many that the Street Parade took on a more aggressive tone than before.
*'''2006 — participants: 800,000 — temp: 17&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Move Your Mind'''
*'''2007 — participants: 800,000 — temp: 23&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Respect'''&lt;br /&gt;The Street Parade attracts 800,000 people despite the bad weather forecast.
*'''2008 — participants: 820,000 — temp: 24&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Friendship'''
*'''2009 — participants: 600,000 — temp: 19&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Still have a Dream'''
*'''2010 — participants: 650,000 — temp: 22&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Celebrate the Spirit of Street Parade
*'''2011 — participants: 900,000 — temp: 28&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: 20 Years Love, Freedom, Tolerance &amp; Respect'''
*'''2012 — participants: 950,000 — temp: 24&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Follow your Heart'''
* '''2013 — participants: 950,000 — temp: 25&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Dance for Freedom'''
* '''2014 — participants: 950,000 — temp: 25&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Enjoy the Dancefloor - and save it!'''
* '''2015 — participants: 1'000,000 — temp: 32&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Magic Moments'''
* '''2016 — participants: 1'000,000 — temp: 26&amp;nbsp;°C — motto: Zurich is unique'''

==Organization==
Since 1996, the event is organized by the Verein Street Parade (Street Parade Association). Today,{{When|date=August 2016}} the Street Parade has all the character of a popular festival, however legally it is still a political demonstration. This frees the organisation of security costs, among all else that the city takes under its charge.

==Political aspects==
According to the official website,  "The Street Parade is still a demonstration that calls on everyone to live together in peace and tolerance." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetparade.com/content/slogan?lang=en-us&amp;id=1&amp;content=67&amp;main=18  20 Years Love, Freedom, Tolerance &amp; Respect] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831012027/http://www.streetparade.com/content/slogan?lang=en-us&amp;id=1&amp;content=67&amp;main=18 |date=2011-08-31 }} on streetparade.com, accessed March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
Since 1996 the counterparade ''Antiparade'' takes place in Zurich on the same day as the Street Parade to provide an alternative to it. Similar to the [[Fuckparade]] in Berlin, the goal of this smaller technoparade is to demonstrate against the increasing commercialisation of club culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Antiparade – Parade of the Nerds| url=http://www.nzz.ch/die-antiparade--umzug-der-nerds-1.11912321|publisher=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|date=15 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Parade of the Orthodox| url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/stadt/Der-Umzug-der-Orthodoxen/story/29592019 |publisher=[[Tages-Anzeiger]]|date=15 August 2010|accessdate=9 August 2016| language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Visions of Simone Machard''''' is a play by the German [[Modernism|modernist]] playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]]. Written in [[1942 in literature#New drama|1942]], the play is the second of three treatments of the [[Joan of Arc]] story that Brecht created (after ''[[Saint Joan of the Stockyards]]'' (written 1929-1931) and before ''[[The Trial of Joan of Arc of Proven, 1431]]'' (1952)). The play was jointly written with [[Lion Feuchtwanger]] and was completed during their exile in [[Los Angeles]]. Set in [[France]] in 1940, it portrays Joan as the patron saint of the resistance movement against the Germans. It was first staged in Frankfurt am Main, in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to the Social and Political Philosophy of Bertolt Brecht: Revolution and Aesthetics|last = Squiers|first = Anthony|publisher = Rodopi|year = 2014|isbn = 9789042038998|location = Amsterdam|pages = 190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the play, an adolescent girl named Simone works at a gas station in central [[France]]. Her older brother is a soldier in the army, and the [[Wehrmacht]] forces are approaching. While engrossed in a book about [[Joan of Arc|Saint Joan]], she slips into a series of dreams in which the real persons in her life take on other identities. Her brother appears as an angel, her boss as the coward Connetand, and herself as Saint Joan who helps starving refugees and defies her employer. In real life she sets fire to a secret supply of gasoline before the Germans can get to it. In her dream she is captured and sentenced to death, but in real life she is not yet considered a saboteur. The Germans hand her over to the French as a mere arsonist, and she is led away by nuns to a mental institution.

{{Economy of Turkey}}
The '''Turkish currency and debt crisis of 2018''' ({{Lang-tr|Türkiye döviz ve borç krizi}}) is an ongoing financial and economic crisis in [[Turkey]] with international repercussions due to [[financial contagion]]. It is characterised by the [[Turkish lira]] (TRY) plunging in value, high [[inflation]], rising borrowing costs, and correspondingly rising [[Default (finance)|loan defaults]]. The crisis was caused by the Turkish economy's excessive [[current account]] deficit and foreign-currency debt, -for some analyists- in combination with President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s increasing [[authoritarianism]] and his unorthodox ideas about [[interest rate]] policy.&lt;ref name=e101 /&gt;&lt;ref name=challenge /&gt;&lt;ref name=crash /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-08-19/turkeys-lessons-for-emerging-economies-101316583.html|title=Turkey’s Lessons for Emerging Economies - Caixin Global|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analyists also stress the leveraging effects of the geopolitical frictions with the United States and recently enforced tariffs by Trump administration on some Turkish products such as steel and aluminum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Goujon |first1=Reva |title= Aug 16, 2018 {{!}} 09:00 GMT  11 mins read Making Sense of Turkey's Economic Crisis |url= https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkish_currency_and_debt_crisis,_2018&amp;action=submit |accessdate= 31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the crisis was prominent for waves of major devaluation of the currency, later stages were characterised by debt defaults and finally by contraction of the economic growth. With the inflation rate stuck in the double digits, [[stagflation]] ensued. The crisis ended a period of overheating economic growth under Erdoğan-led governments, built largely on a construction boom fuelled by easy credit and government spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/business/turkey-lira-currency.html|title=Life in Turkey Now: Tough Talk, but Fears of Drug Shortages|date=17 August 2018|publisher=New York Times|author=Jack Ewing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current account deficit and foreign-currency debt ==

[[File:Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge IMG 3065.jpg|thumb|right|Previous economic growth had been led by fiscal and monetary stimulus to the construction industry,&lt;ref name=bentley /&gt;&lt;ref name=bet /&gt; resulting in a huge backlog of unsold new houses,&lt;ref name=houses /&gt; and unprofitable grand projects like the [[Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge]].&lt;ref name=selim /&gt;]]

A longstanding characteristic of Turkey's economy is a low savings rate.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/05/19/how-turkey-fell-from-investment-darling-to-junk-rated-emerging-market|title=How Turkey fell from investment darling to junk-rated emerging market|date=19 May 2018|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] assumed control of the government, Turkey has been running huge and growing [[current account]] deficits, $33.1 billion in 2016 and $47.3 billion in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-current-account-deficit-at-5-4-billion-in-april-133114|title=Turkey’s current account deficit at $5.4 billion in April|date=11 June 2018|work=Hurriyet Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; climbing to US$7.1 billion in the month of January 2018 with the rolling 12-month deficit rising to $51.6 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/turkish-economy/turkish-current-account-deficit-more-doubles|title=Turkish current account deficit more than doubles|date=12 March 2018|work=Ahval}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest current account deficits in the world.&lt;ref name=economist /&gt; The economy has relied on capital inflows to fund private-sector excess, with Turkey's banks and big firms borrowing heavily, often in foreign currencies.&lt;ref name=economist /&gt; Under these conditions, Turkey must find approximately $200 billion a year to fund its wide current account deficit and maturing debt, while being always at risk of inflows drying up; the state has gross foreign currency reserves of just $85 billion.&lt;ref name=challenge&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/79317f20-67f5-11e8-8cf3-0c230fa67aec|title=Inflation rise poses challenge to Erdogan as election looms|date=5 June 2018|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic policy underlying these trends had increasingly been micro-managed by Erdoğan since the election of his AK Party in 2002, and strongly so since 2008, with a focus on the [[construction|construction industry]], state-awarded contracts and stimulus measures. Although, [[research and development]] expenditure of the country (% of GDP) and the government expenditure on [[education]](% of GDP) are nearly doubled during AK Party governments, the desired outcomes could not been achieved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research and development expenditure (% of GDP) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS |website=The World Bank Data |publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics |accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Government expenditure on education, total (% of GDP) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS?end=2014&amp;locations=TR&amp;start=1999&amp;view=chart&amp;year=2014 |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) Institute for Statistics. |accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bet&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-06-22/a-crazy-200-billion-says-erdogan-wins-his-election-bet|title=A Crazy $200 Billion Says Erdogan Wins His Election Bet|date=22 June 2018|publisher=Bloomberg|author1=Marc Champion|author2=Cagan Koc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motive for these policies have been described as Erdoğan losing faith in Western-style capitalism since the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]] by the secretary general of the main Turkish business association, [[Turkish Industry and Business Association|TUSIAD]].&lt;ref name=bet /&gt;

Investment inflows had already been declining in the period leading up to the crisis, owing to Erdoğan instigating political disagreements with countries that were major sources of such inflows (such as Germany, France, and the Netherlands).&lt;ref name=e101 /&gt; Following the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|2016 coup attempt]], the government [[2016–present purges in Turkey|seized the assets]] of those it considered involved, even if their ties to the coup were attenuated. Erdoğan has not taken seriously concerns that foreign companies investing in Turkey might be deterred by the country's political instability.&lt;ref name=e101 /&gt; Other factors include worries about the decreasing value of lira (TRY) which threatens to eat into investors' profit margins.&lt;ref name=e101&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/25/erdogan-is-a-mad-economist-and-turkey-is-his-laboratory/|title=Erdogan Is Failing Economics 101|date=25 May 2018|publisher=Foreign Policy|author=Borzou Daragahi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment inflows have also declined because Erdoğan's [[Erdoğanism|increasing authoritarianism]] has quelled free and factual reporting by [[financial analyst]]s in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/a-big-chill-silences-turkey-s-market-analysts-amid-lira-s-plunge|title=A Big Chill Has Silenced Turkey’s Market Analysts|date=24 May 2018|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between January and May 2017, foreign portfolio investors funded $13.2 billion of Turkey's $17.5 billion current account deficit, according to the latest available data. During the same period this year they plugged just $763 million of a swollen $27.3 billion deficit.&lt;ref name=pariah /&gt;

By the end of 2017, the corporate foreign-currency debt in Turkey had more than doubled since 2009, up to $214 billion after netting against their foreign-exchange assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-29/turkey-s-bill-for-debt-fueled-economic-growth-starts-to-fall-due|title=Turkey's Bill for Debt-Fueled Economic Growth Starts to Fall Due|date=29 March 2018|agency=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey's gross external debt, both public and private, stood at $453.2 billion at the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/turkeys-external-debt-stock-reaches-4532b-/1103634|title=Turkey's external debt stock reaches $453.2B|date=30 March 2018|agency=Anadolu}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2018, $181.8 billion of external debt, public and private, was due to mature within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/wps/wcm/connect/b19b5048-dd64-4075-ae01-47b2fd3ede50/st.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-b19b5048-dd64-4075-ae01-47b2fd3ede50-mdO36yX|title=Short Term External Debt Statistics|date=March 2018|work=Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası (Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-resident holdings of domestic shares stood at $53.3 billion in early March and at $39.6 billion in mid-May, and non-resident holdings of domestic government bonds stood at $32.0 billion in early March and at $24.7 billion in mid-May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/wps/wcm/connect/7b1a6b8b-cd10-43ae-90b4-b3d702fae602/hmkexcelEn.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-7b1a6b8b-cd10-43ae-90b4-b3d702fae602-mehWrra/|title=Securities Statistics|date=18 May 2018|work=Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası (Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall non-residents’ ownership of Turkish equities, government bonds and corporate debt has plummeted from a high of $92 billion in August 2017 to just $53 billion as of July 13, 2018.&lt;ref name=pariah&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/115e91ac-8f51-11e8-bb8f-a6a2f7bca546|title=Turkey nears ‘pariah’ status over defiance on rates|date=31 July 2018|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government's ‘action plans’ to tackle the crisis ==

The finance minister of the Turkish government, Albayrak unveiled a new economic program to stave off the recent financial crisis.

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' quoted leading emerging markets financial analyst Timothy Ash analyzing that "Turkey has strong banks, healthy public finances, good demographics, pro-business culture but [has been] spoiled over past four to five years by unorthodox and loose macroeconomic management."&lt;ref name=strong /&gt; By mid-June, analysts in London suggested that with its current government, Turkey would be well advised to seek an [[International Monetary Fund]] loan even before the dwindling central bank foreign exchange reserves run out, because it would strengthen the central bank's hand against Erdoğan and help gain back investor confidence in the soundness of Turkey's economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/turkish-lira/turkey-needs-imf-loans-after-investor-confidence-undercut|title=Turkey needs IMF loans after investor confidence undercut|date=16 June 2018|publisher=Ahval|author=Mark Bentley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] described the unfolding crisis as "a classic currency-and-debt crisis, of a kind we’ve seen many times", adding: "At such a time, the quality of leadership suddenly matters a great deal. You need officials who understand what’s happening, can devise a response and have enough credibility that markets give them the benefit of the doubt. Some emerging markets have those things, and they are riding out the turmoil fairly well. The Erdoğan regime has none of that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/opinion/turkey-trump-erdogan.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region|title=Turmoil for Turkey’s Trump|date=24 May 2018|author=Paul Krugman|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences in Turkey ==
During the emergence of the crisis, lenders in Turkey were hit by restructuring demands of corporations unable to serve their [[United States dollar|USD]] or [[Euro|EUR]] denominated debt, due to the loss of value of their earnings in [[Turkish lira]]. While financial institutions had been the driver of the [[Istanbul stock exchange]] for many years, accounting for almost half it's value, by mid-April they accounted for less than one-third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-10/investors-bet-against-turkey-banks-as-debt-wave-gathers-force|title=Investors Bet Against Turkey Banks as Debt Wave Gains Force|date=10 April 2018|agency=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late-May, lenders were facing a surge in demand from companies seeking to reorganise debt repayments.&lt;ref name=pile&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-31/turkish-banks-face-increasing-pile-of-debt-restructuring-demands|title=Turkish Banks Face Rising Pile of Debt-Restructuring Demands|date=31 May 2018|agency=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early-July, public restructuring requests by some of the country's biggest businesses alone already totalled $20,000,000,000 with other debtors not publicly listed or large enough to require disclosures.&lt;ref name=bereket&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-05/turkey-s-bereket-is-said-to-begin-sales-to-pay-4-billion-debt|title=Turkey's Bereket Is Said to Begin Sales to Pay $4 Billion Debt|date=5 July 2018|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[asset quality]] of Turkish banks, as well as their [[capital adequacy ratio]], kept deteriorating throughout the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/turkish-lira/unethical-moodys-forewarns-second-wave-turkish-crisis|title=‘Unethical’ Moody’s forewarns second wave of Turkish crisis|date=9 June 2018|author=Mark Bentley|publisher=Ahval}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June [[Halk Bankası]], the most vulnerable of the large lenders, had lost 63% of its US dollar value since last summer and traded at 40% of book value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/turkeys-economic-crisis-has-just-begun/|title=Turkey’s economic crisis has just begun|date=12 June 2018|author=David P. Goldman|publisher=Asia Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is hard to say that this is mainly due to the economic developments in Turkey since the valuation of Halkbank was largely affected by the rumors over the possible outcomes of the US investigation about the bank's alleged help Iran for evading US sanctions.&lt;ref name="ING-Halkbank"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smallwood |first1=Nicholas |title=Halkbank: What happens next? |url=https://think.ing.com/articles/turkish-bank-halkbank-posts-1q18-results/ |website=THINK - Economic and Financial Analysis |publisher=ING Bank |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Banks continuously raised interest rates for business and consumer loans and [[Mortgage loan|mortgage loan]] rates, towards 20% annually, thus curbing demand from businesses and consumers. With a corresponding growth in deposits, the gap between total deposits and total loans, which had been one of the highest in emerging markets, began to narrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/turkish-banking/cash-hungry-turkish-banks-raise-rates-highest-crisis|title=Cash-hungry Turkish banks raise rates to highest since crisis|date=9 April 2018|publisher=Ahval}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=estate&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/turkey-economy/turkey-limits-real-estate-commissions-house-prices-slashed|title=Turkey limits real estate commissions, house prices slashed|date=14 May 2018|publisher=Ahval}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this development has also led to unfinished or unoccupied housing and commercial real estate littering the outskirts of Turkey's major cities, as Erdoğan's policies had fuelled the construction sector, where many of his business allies are very active, to lead past economic growth.&lt;ref name=bentley&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/turkish-elections/turkish-real-estate-ills-reflect-erdogans-snap-poll-decision|title=Turkish real estate ills reflect Erdoğan’s snap poll decision|date=19 April 2018|publisher=Ahval|author=Mark Bentley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=estate /&gt; In March 2018, home sales fell 14% and mortgage sales declined 35% compared to a year earlier.

While heavy portfolio capital outflows persisted, $883,000,000 in June, with official foreign exchange reserves declining by a $6,990,000,000 during June, the current account deficit started narrowing in June, due to the weakened exchange rate for the lira.

As a consequence of the earlier monetary policy of easy money, any newfound fragile short-term macroeconomic stability is based on higher interest rates, thus creating a recessionary effect for the Turkish economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/turkey-economy/turkish-contraction-looms-rates-fallout-becomes-evident|title=Turkish contraction looms as rates fallout becomes evident|date=8 June 2018|publisher=Ahval|author=Güldem Atabay Şanlı}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-June, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' carried the quote from a senior financial figure in Istanbul that "years of irresponsible policies have overheated the Turkish economy.

=== Timeline of events (2018) ===
* 12 February – [[Yıldız Holding]] unexpectedly requested to restructure as much as $7,000,000,000 in loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-12/yildiz-7-billion-request-adds-to-asset-woes-for-turkish-banks|title=Yildiz $7 Billion Restructuring Bid Adds to Turkish Bank Woes|date=12 February 2018|agency=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 21 February – Cemil Ertem, senior economic adviser to president [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], published an opinion piece in the ''[[Daily Sabah]]'' suggesting that the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s policy advice for Turkey's central bank to raise short term interest rates should be ignored and that "not only Turkey, but all developing countries, should do the opposite of what the IMF preaches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/imf-turkey/imf-backed-terrorists-has-failed-turkey-adviser|title=IMF backed by terrorists has failed in Turkey – adviser|date=21 February 2018|work=Ahval}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 7 April – [[Doğuş Group|Doğuş Holding]] applied to their banks for debt restructuring. Doğuş’ outstanding loans stood at the equivalent of 23,500,000,000 Turkish lira (£2,765,597,500) at the end of 2017; up 11% from the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-dogus-gyo-debt/turkeys-dogus-in-talks-with-banks-on-debt-restructuring-sources-idUSKBN1HE06U|title=Turkey's Dogus in talks with banks on debt restructuring|date=7 April 2018|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 18 April – President Erdoğan announced that the upcoming [[Turkish general election, 2018|general election]] would be held on 24 June, eighteen months earlier than scheduled.

* 14 and 15 May – In a televised interview with ''Bloomberg'' and in a meeting with global money managers in [[London]], Erdoğan said that after the elections, he intended to take greater control of the economy, including ''de facto'' control over monetary policy, and to implement lower interest rates; this caused "shock and disbelief" among investors about the central bank's ability to fight inflation and stabilise the lira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-markets-investors/disbelief-investors-in-turkey-stunned-by-erdogans-fight-with-markets-idUSKCN1IG2Y1|title='Disbelief': Investors in Turkey stunned by Erdogan's fight with markets|date=15 May 2018|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unorthodox /&gt;

* 30 May – Turkey's central bank released minutes of the crucial 23 May Monetary Policy Committee meeting, saying that “the tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement and becomes consistent with the targets”, the latter being 5 percent by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-central-bank-vows-tight-policy-warns-about-risks-132659|title=Turkish Central Bank vows tight policy, warns about risks|date=31 May 2018|work=Hurriyet Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One aspect concerns risk to foreign lenders, where according to the [[Bank for International Settlements]], international banks had outstanding loans of $224 billion to Turkish borrowers, including $83 billion from banks in Spain, $35 billion from banks in France, $18 billion from banks in Italy, $17 billion each from banks in the United States and in the United Kingdom, and $13 billion from banks in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://turkey.theglobepost.com/turkey-economy-bonds-erdogan/|title=Turkey’s Economy Under Great Stress After Erdogan’s Monetary Remarks|date=22 May 2018|publisher=The Globe Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article176765162/Drohende-Kreditausfaelle-Europas-Banken-fuerchten-tuerkischen-Kollaps.html|title=Europas Banken fürchten den türkischen Kollaps|date=29 May 2018|publisher=Die Welt|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect concerns the situation of other [[emerging economies]] with high levels of debt denominated in USD or EUR, with respect to which Turkey may either be considered "a canary in the coalmine" or even by its crisis and the bad handling thereof increase international investors' retreat for increased perception of risk in such countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/turkey-lira-turmoil-herald-global-financial-crisis-180825165156035.html|title=Turkey's lira turmoil could herald a global financial crisis|date=26 August 2018|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 2018, the Institute of Financial Research (IIF) reported that the Turkish crisis has already spread to [[Lebanon]], [[Colombia]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.nl/debt-contagion-in-argentina-and-turkey-is-spreading-to-other-countries-2018-6/?international=true&amp;r=UK|title=Debt ‘contagion’ in Argentina and Turkey is spreading to other countries|date=6 June 2018|publisher=Businessinsider|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 7 March – Credit ratings agency [[Moody's Investors Service]] downgraded Turkey's [[sovereign debt]], warning of an erosion of checks and balances under Erdoğan, and saying that the [[Turkish military operation in Afrin]], having strained [[Turkey–United States relations|ties with Washington]] and drawn the country deeper into the Syrian civil war, had added an extra layer of geopolitical risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moody’s downgrades Turkish debt|url=https://www.ft.com/content/18004182-2263-11e8-9a70-08f715791301|publisher=Financial Times|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 7 June – Credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service downgraded the ratings of 17 Turkish banks, reasoning "that the operating environment in Turkey has deteriorated, with negative implications for the institutions’ funding profile."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/moodys-takes-rating-actions-on-19-turkish-financial-institutions-132988|title=Moody’s takes rating actions on 19 Turkish financial institutions|date=8 June 2018|publisher=Hurriyet Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on 7 June, Moody's put eleven of Turkey’s top companies under review, because their credit quality was correlated in varying degrees to the government in [[Ankara]].

* 26 June – The [[European Union]]'s [[General Affairs Council]] stated that "the Council notes that Turkey has been moving further away from the European Union.

* 13 July – Credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings downgraded Turkey's debt rating further into junk with negative outlook, reasoning that "economic policy credibility has deteriorated in recent months and initial policy actions following elections in June have heightened uncertainty (...) Monetary policy credibility has been damaged by comments by President Erdoğan suggesting a greater role of the presidency in setting monetary policy after the elections (...) Monetary policy has persistently been unable to bring inflation near its 5% target and inflation expectations have become unanchored. Key figures from the previous administration with reformist credentials were excluded from a new cabinet, appointed on 9 July, while the son-in-law of the president was appointed as Minister of Treasury and Finance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/turkey-economy/fitch-downgrades-turkey-bb-outlook-negative|title=Fitch Downgrades Turkey to 'BB'; Outlook Negative|date=13 July 2018|publisher=Ahval}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 20 July – The government of Germany lifted export credit guarantee sanctions against Turkey, which it had implemented a year earlier in order to protest the ongoing state of emergency (OHAL) in Turkey and to effect the release of German citizen [[Deniz Yücel]] and others held under arrest by the Turkish government, after the German citizens concerned were freed and the state of emergency was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/export-absicherung-bundesregierung-hebt-obergrenzen-fuer-tuerkei-buergschaften-auf/22829208.html|title=Bundesregierung hebt Obergrenzen für Türkei-Bürgschaften auf|date=21 July 2018|publisher=Handelsblatt|language=german}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2018-07-30/how-save-us-turkey-relationship|title=How to Save the U.S.-Turkey Relationship|date=30 July 2018|publisher=Foreign Affairs|author=Amanda Sloat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 26 July – European rating agency Scope Ratings placed Turkey's BB+ sovereign ratings on review for downgrade, citing i) "Deterioration in Turkey’s economic policy and governance framework both before and in following the June election, which weigh on the effectiveness and credibility of fiscal, monetary and structural economic policy management" alongside ii) "Increasing downside risks to Turkey’s macroeconomic stability stemming from external vulnerabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scoperatings.com/#search/research/detail/157333EN|title=Scope places Turkey’s BB+ ratings under review for downgrade|date=26 July 2018|publisher=Scope Ratings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 10 August – The [[European Central Bank]] voiced increased concerns about the exposure of some of the [[Euro]] currency area's biggest lenders to Turkey – chiefly [[BBVA]], [[UniCredit]] and [[BNP Paribas]] – in light of the lira's dramatic fall.&lt;ref name=Allah&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/51311230-9be7-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d|title=Turkish lira plunges as crisis mounts|date=10 August 2018|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the US government started "a bullet a day" economic sanctions against Turkey, designed to effect the release of US citizen [[Andrew Brunson]] and 15 others, held under arrest (on charges described as a sham by U.S. officials) by the Turkish government; in a first step, US President Donald Trump announced a doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1027899286586109955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkish-turmoil-is-tied-to-pastors-fate-1533942854|title=Turkish Turmoil Is Tied to Pastor’s Fate|date=10 August 2018|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 16 August – European rating agency Scope Ratings downgraded Turkey's sovereign ratings to BB- from BB+ and revised the Outlook to Negative, citing in the downgrade: i) "Deterioration in Turkey’s economic policy predictability and credibility, in view of monetary, fiscal and structural economic policies inconsistent with the rebalancing of the economy onto a more sustainable path"; ii) "Accentuated macroeconomic imbalances"; and iii) "The impact of balance of payment weaknesses on modest levels of international reserves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scoperatings.com/#search/research/detail/157475EN|title=Scope downgrades Turkey’s credit rating to BB- from BB+ and changes Outlook to Negative|date=16 August 2018|publisher=Scope Ratings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Improvements ==
On 29th November the Turkish lira hit an 4 month high in value against the [[US Dollar]]. It recovered from 7.0738 against the dollar to 5.17 on 29 November, an increase of 36.8%. Reuters also reported in a response to a poll that it expects the inflation to decrease for the November month. The reasons that were given are the positive exchanges, discounts on products and taxt cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasdaq.com/article/turkish-cpi-expected-to-fall-from-15year-peak-in-november-poll-shows-20181129-00458|title=Turkish CPI expected to fall from 15-year peak in November, poll shows|date=29 November 2018|publisher=Nasdaq|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside sanctions on specific government figures, [[tariffs]] were also used by both countries to create economic pressure. Vox describes it as a "[[trade war|trade spat]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kirby |first1=Jen |title=The US-Turkey trade spat, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/world/2018/8/15/17687928/turkey-united-states-tariffs-lira-andrew-brunson |accessdate=August 15, 2018 |work=Vox |publisher=Vox Media |date=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators such as Vox's Jen Kirby have pointed to the pivotal role Brunson's case plays in it.

A tariff on steel and other products was placed on Turkey by the United States. However, Sarah Sanders has described the American tariffs as related to "national defense"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/us-tariffs-on-turkey-for-national-security-will-not-be-lifted-white-house-118081600095_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;, and thus not changeable by circumstances, noting that only the sanctions would be lifted upon the release of Brunson. 

Erdogan describes these tariffs as an "economic war" against Turkey. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-currency-erdogan/turkey-is-a-target-of-economic-war-erdogan-says-idUSKBN1KW08U&lt;/ref&gt;

In retaliation, Turkey announced tariffs on US products, most notably the iPhone. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.voanews.com/a/erdogan-wants-boycott-of-us-electronics/4527699.html&lt;/ref&gt; The tariffs by Turkey cover products such as American cars, and coal. At a White House Press conference, Sanders described these as "regrettable".  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-condemns-turkey-s-tariffs-on-us-products/4530059.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders claimed that the Turkish economic trouble was part of a long-term trend that wasn't related to any actions America did.


On August 22, 2018, [[John R. Bolton]], speaking to Reuters, said "the Turkish government made a big mistake in not releasing Pastor Brunson... [e]very day that goes by that mistake continues, this crisis could be over instantly if they did the right thing as a NATO ally, part of the West, and release pastor Brunson without condition." &lt;ref name="Reuters Bolton economy"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Dan |title=U.S.-Turkey crisis could end 'instantly' if pastor freed: Bolton |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-turkey-bolton-interview/us-turkey-crisis-could-end-instantly-if-pastor-freed-bolton-idUSKCN1L70A5 |accessdate=28 August 2018 |agency=Reuters |date=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to state that Turkey's membership in NATO was not as much of a major foreign policy issue for the US, but instead the American focus was on individuals that the United States believes Turkey is holding for non-legitimate reasons. Bolton also expressed skepticism in regard to Qatar's attempts to infuse money in the Turkish economy.&lt;ref name="Reuters Bolton economy" /&gt; 
Erdogan spokesman  Ibrahim Kalin, in a written statement, described these remarks as an admission that, contra Sanders, the American tariffs were, in fact, in relation to the Brunson case and proof that the US intended them to economically war against Turkey. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-currency-erdogan-nato-exclusiv/exclusive-bolton-remarks-proof-us-targeting-turkey-in-economic-war-erdogan-spokesman-idUSKCN1L729I&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a poll from April 2018, 42 percent of Turks, and 59 percent of Erdoğan's governing AKP voters, saw the decline in the lira as a plot by foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/turkish-lira/forty-two-percent-turks-say-liras-drop-foreign-plot|title=Forty-two percent of Turks say lira's drop is foreign plot|date=18 May 2018|publisher=Ahval}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another poll from July, 36 percent of survey respondents said it the AKP government was most responsible for the depreciation of the Turkish lira, while 42 percent said it was foreign governments.&lt;ref name=poll&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/08/22/turkeys-currency-is-plummeting-heres-what-it-might-mean-for-president-erdogan/?noredirect=on|title=Will Turkey’s currency crisis hurt Erdogan?

=== Crisis as a topic in the June 2018 elections ===
{{Further|Turkish general election, 2018}}

On 16 May, a day after [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) president [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] had unsettled markets during his visit to London by suggesting he would curb the independence of the [[Central Bank of Turkey]] after the election, [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) presidential candidate [[Muharrem İnce]] and [[İyi Party|İYİ Party]] presidential candidate [[Meral Akşener]] both vowed to ensure the independence of the central bank if elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-election-chp/erdogans-policies-driving-turkey-to-the-edge-challenger-says-idUSKCN1IH2BO|title=Erdogan's policies driving Turkey to the edge, challenger says|date=16 May 2018|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tired-driver-is-sending-turkeys-economy-over-cliff-edge-iyi-party-head-aksener-131932|title=‘Tired driver’ is sending Turkey’s economy over cliff edge: İYİ Party head Akşener|date=16 May 2018|work=Hurriyet Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/chp-presidential-candidate-muharrem-ince-vows-to-ensure-central-bank-independence-if-elected-131953|title=CHP presidential candidate Muharrem İnce vows to ensure Central Bank independence if elected|date=17 May 2018|work=Hurriyet Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 26 May interview [[Muharrem İnce presidential campaign, 2018|on his campaign trail]], CHP presidential candidate Muharrem İnce said on economic policy that "the central bank can only halt the lira’s slide temporarily by raising interest rates, because it’s not the case that depreciation fundamentally stems from interest rates being too high or too low. So, the central bank will intervene, but the things that really need to be done are in the political and legal areas. Turkey needs to immediately be extricated from a political situation that breeds economic uncertainty, and its economy must be handled by independent and autonomous institutions. My economic team is ready, and we have been working together for a long time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/muharrem-ince/muharrem-ince-turkish-economy-needs-political-reform-exclusive|title=Muharrem İnce: Turkish economy needs political reform|date=26 May 2018|publisher=Ahval}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a nationwide survey conducted between 13 and 20 May, 45 percent saw the economy (including the steadily-dropping lira and unemployment) as the greatest challenge facing Turkey, with foreign policy at 18 percent, the justice system at 7 percent and terror and security at 5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/economy/turkeys-biggest-problems-economy-unemployment-survey|title=Turkey’s biggest problems economy, unemployment - survey|date=23 May 2018|publisher=Ahval}}&lt;/ref&gt;

İYİ Party presidential candidate Meral Akşener, supported by a strong economic team led by former Central Bank Governor Durmuş Yılmaz,&lt;ref name=bentley /&gt; had on 7 May presented her party's economic program, saying that "we will purchase the debts from consumer loans, credit card and overdraft accounts of 4.5 million citizens whose debts are under legal supervision of banks or consumer financing companies and whose debts have been sold to collection companies as of April 30, 2018.

{{other uses|The Two Boys (disambiguation)}}
'''''Two Boys''''' is an [[opera]] in two acts by American composer [[Nico Muhly]], with an English-language [[libretto]] by American playwright [[Craig Lucas]]. The opera's story is based on real events in Manchester, England, in 2001 as described in a 2005 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article titled "You Want Me 2 Kill Him?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/ontheweb/features/2005/02/bachrach200502|title=You Want Me 2 Kill Him?|work=Vanity Fair|date=February 2005|first=Judy|last=Bachrach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhly's opera was first performed by the [[English National Opera]] (ENO) in London on 24 June 2011, directed by [[Bartlett Sher]].&lt;ref name=ENO&gt;{{Citation|title=''Two Boys'' production details|publisher=English National Opera|url=http://www.eno.org/see-whats-on/productions/production-page.php?&amp;itemid=1092}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed by the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York in October and November 2013. The ENO and the Met shared the initial production costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/13/arts/music/13met.html?ref=music|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Muhly and Lucas's Opera First Met-Lincoln Center Project|first=Daniel J.|last=Wakin|date=13 February 2010|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/136904-Sher-to-Stage-Lucas-Muhly-Opera-at-the-Met-and-English-National-Opera "Sher to Stage Lucas-Muhly Opera at the Met and English National Opera"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013055752/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/136904-Sher-to-Stage-Lucas-Muhly-Opera-at-the-Met-and-English-National-Opera |date=2012-10-13 }} by Adam Hetrick, ''[[Playbill]]'' (12 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the narrative structure of a police investigation into a violent crime, the opera explores the world of online relationships and chatrooms, and was billed by the ENO as "a cautionary tale of the dark side of the internet."&lt;ref name=ENO /&gt;

[[Nonesuch Records]] released the first recording of the piece, from the Metropolitan Opera production, in 2014.&lt;ref name="album"&gt;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/recording-metropolitan-opera-production-nico-muhly-two-boys-out-now-nonesuch-2014-09-30|title=Recording of Metropolitan Opera Production of Nico Muhly's ''Two Boys'' Out Now on Nonesuch|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Two Boys'' opened to mixed reviews from the British press. William Hartstone in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' called it "thoroughly modern opera, both disturbing and challenging".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Opera Review: ''Two Boys'', English Nantional Opera|author=William Hartston|work=Daily Express|date=29 June 2011|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/255746/Opera-review-Two-Boys-English-National-Opera}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Seckerson writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' praised the composition, libretto and staging, calling it "an auspicious operatic debut."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=''Two Boys'', English National Opera|author=Edward Seckerson|date=25 June 2011|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/reviews/two-boys-english-national-opera-2302721.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Gillard writing in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', said, "A compelling opera for our time inspired by real-life internet crime," while conceding that the overall evening was "static".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=''Two Boys'': A compelling opera for our time inspired by real-life internet crime|author=David Gillard|date=1 July 2011|work=Daily Mail|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2010307/Two-Boys-review-Compelling-opera-time-inspired-real-life-internet-crime.html?ito=feeds-newsxml}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Hall, writing in ''[[The Stage]]'', praised the libretto, but called Muhly's music "a commonplace and ultimately thin soundtrack accompaniment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=''Two Boys''|author=George Hall|date=27 June 2011|work=The Stage|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/32689/two-boys}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rupert Christiansen]], writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', described it as "a bit of a bore – dreary and earnest rather than moving and gripping, and smartly derivative rather than distinctively individual". He continued, "It sounds more intriguing than it is, because Muhly signally fails to build the narrative into a sound melodramatic structure. Although the opera isn't long, it seems so, plodding along without substantial contrast of pace or mood, and never reaching a satisfactory climax."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=''Two Boys'', ENO, review|author=Rupert Christiansen|authorlink=Rupert Christiansen|date=27 June 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/8600499/Two-Boys-ENO-review.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''New York Times'', Zachary Woolfe wrote: "Serious and radiant, ''Two Boys'' is a landmark in the career of an important artist. Confidently staking his claim to the operatic tradition, Mr. Muhly has added to it a work of dark beauty."&lt;ref&gt;Woolfe, Zachary, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/01/arts/music/two-boys-by-nico-muhly-at-the-english-national-opera-review.html "On the Internet, Nobody Knows You're a Youngster With Issues"], ''The New York Times'', June 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Bloomberg review began by quoting Muhly's PR tagline as "the hottest composer on the planet", concluding "Whichever planet that is, it must be a pretty tepid one." The review also faulted the libretto which "moves with such exasperating slowness, that if the audience hasn't worked things out by Act II, then they're probably asleep or sensibly diverting their mental energy elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Psychopaths Haunt Classrooms in Nico Muhly's ''Two Boys'': Review|author=Bloomberg|date=26 June 2011|work=SF Gate|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/06/26/bloomberg1376-LNF3720YHQ0X01-7DLBPDHR88TE2SUL051SISDGMR.DTL#ixzz1R9ZTJEf4}} {{Dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opera elicited unkind comparisons to police procedurals on TV. ''The Independent'' dismissed it as "''[[Prime Suspect]]'' with a soundtrack of semi-skimmed [[Philip Glass|Glass]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=''Two Boys'', Coliseum, London – ''Seven Angels'', CBSO Centre, Birmingham – ''Das Rheingold'', Town Hall, Leeds|author=Picard, Anna|date=26 June 2011|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/reviews/two-boys-coliseum-londonbrseven-angels-cbso-centre-birminghambrdas-rheingold-town-hall-leeds-2302743.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Guardian'', which has frequently commissioned guest columns from Muhly, Andrew Clements dismissed the opera as "a bland mid-Atlantic compromise" with a musical idiom "pitched somewhere between recent [[Philip Glass]] and the [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] of ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=''Two Boys'' - review|author=Clements, Andrew|date=25 June 2011|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/25/two-boys-review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''The Londonist'', Sam Smith concurred, "Muhly's music...is interesting but can feel underwhelming and derivative."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Opera Review: ''Two Boys'' @ Coliseum|author=Smith, Sam|date=28 June 2011|work=The Londonist|url=http://londonist.com/2011/06/opera-review-two-boys-coliseum.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''So So Gay'' panned the production as "an operatic misadventure" and "a dreary letdown", and agreeing that the music "is minimalist to the point of being unexciting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Opera Review: ''Two Boys''|author=Waygood, James|date=4 July 2011|work=So So Gay|url=http://sosogay.org/2011/opera-review-two-boys-the-london-coliseum-london/|access-date=2011-07-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706070916/http://sosogay.org/2011/opera-review-two-boys-the-london-coliseum-london/#|archive-date=2011-07-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Financial Times'', Andrew Clark felt the opera was underwhelming and that "the fault lies in Muhly's generic minimalism. The orchestral accompaniment, rarely breaking out of a steady moderato, has the quality of a soundtrack. Vocal lines are singable but impersonal...'Accessible' hovers over every bar."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=''Two Boys'', Coliseum, London|author=Clark, Andrew|date=27 June 2011|work=The Financial Times|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a74e187c-a0d9-11e0-adae-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1R9VoqeXj|access-date=2011-07-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630084054/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a74e187c-a0d9-11e0-adae-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1R9VoqeXj#axzz1R9VoqeXj|archive-date=2011-06-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tết''' ({{IPA-vi|tet˧˥|}} or {{IPA-vi|təːt˧˥|}}), or '''Vietnamese New Year''', is the most important celebration in [[Vietnamese culture]]. The word is a shortened form of '''Tết Nguyên Đán'''(節元旦), which is [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] for "Feast of the First Morning of the First Day". Tết celebrates the arrival of spring based on the [[Vietnamese calendar]], which usually has the date falling in January or February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TET NGUYEN DAN The Vietnamese New Year|url=http://www.queensbotanical.org/education/56902/57016/vietnam|accessdate=12 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527124500/http://www.queensbotanical.org/education/56902/57016/vietnam|archivedate=27 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnamese people celebrate the Lunar New Year annually, which is based on a [[lunisolar calendar]] (calculating both the earth's movement around the sun and the moon around the earth). Tết is generally celebrated on the same day as [[Chinese New Year]], except when the one-hour time difference between [[Vietnam]] and [[China]] results in [[new moon]] occurring on different days. It takes place from the first day of the first month of the Vietnamese calendar (around late January or early February) until at least the third day. Many [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] prepare for Tết by cooking special holiday food and cleaning the house. These foods include ''bánh chưng, bánh dày,'' dried young bamboo soup (''canh măng''), ''giò'', and sticky rice. Many customs are practiced during Tết, such as visiting a person's house on the first day of the new year (''xông nhà''), ancestor worship, wishing New Year's greetings, giving lucky money to children and elderly people, and opening a shop.

Tết is also an occasion for pilgrims and family reunions. They start forgetting about the troubles of the past year and hope for a better upcoming year. They consider Tết to be the first day of spring, and the festival is often called ''Hội xuân ''(spring festival).

Vietnamese people usually return to their families during Tết. Some return to worship at the family altar or visit the graves of their ancestors in their homeland. They also clean the graves of their family as a sign of respect. Although Tết is a national holiday among all Vietnamese, each region and religion has its own customs.

Tết in the three Vietnamese regions can be divided into three periods, known as ''Tất Niên'' (penultimate New Year's Eve), ''Giao Thừa'' (New Year's Eve), and ''Tân Niên'' (the New Year), representing the preparation before Tết, the eve of Tết, and the days of and following Tết, respectively. &lt;!-- All of these customs are to celebrate Tết in Vietnam. --&gt;

===The New Year===

[[Image:LiXi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A red envelope.]]

The first day of Tết is reserved for the  [[nuclear family]]. Children receive a [[red envelope]] containing money from their elders. This tradition is called ''mừng tuổi'' (happy new age) in the north and ''lì xì'' in the south. Usually, children wear their new clothes and give their elders the traditional Tết greetings before receiving the money. Since the Vietnamese believe that the first visitor a family receives in the year determines their fortune for the entire year, people never enter any house on the first day without being invited first. The act of being the first person to enter a house on Tết is called  ''xông đất'', ''xông nhà'' or ''đạp đất'', which is one of the most important rituals during Tết. According to Vietnamese tradition, if good things come to the family on the first day of the lunar New Year, the entire following year will also be full of blessings. Usually, a person of good temper, morality, and success will be the lucky sign for the host family and be invited first into the house. However, just to be safe, the owner of the house will leave the house a few minutes before midnight and come back just as the clock strikes midnight to prevent anyone else entering the house first who might potentially bring any unfortunate events in the new year to the household.

Sweeping during Tết is taboo or ''xui'' (unlucky), since it symbolizes sweeping the luck away; that is why they clean before the new year. It is also taboo for anyone who experienced a recent loss of a family member to visit anyone else during Tết.

During subsequent days, people visit relatives and friends. Traditionally but not strictly, the second day of Tết is usually reserved for friends, while the third day is for teachers, who command respect in Vietnam. Local [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples are popular spots as people like to give donations and to get their fortunes told during Tết. Children are free to spend their new money on toys or on [[gambling]] games such as ''[[bau cua ca cop|bầu cua cá cọp]]'', which can be found in the streets. Prosperous families can pay for dragon dancers to perform at their house. Also, public performances are given for everyone to watch.

These celebrations can last from a day up to the entire week, and the New Year is filled with people in the streets trying to make as much noise as possible using firecrackers, drums, bells, gongs, and anything they can think of to ward off evil spirits.  This parade will also include different masks, and dancers hidden under the guise of what is known as the ''Mua Lan ''or [[Lion dance#Vietnamese Lion|Lion Dancing]].  The ''Lan'' is an animal between a lion and a dragon, and is the symbol of strength in the Vietnamese culture that is used to scare away evil spirits.  After the parade, families and friends come together to have a feast of traditional Vietnamese dishes, and share the happiness and joy of the New Year with one another.  This is also the time when the elders will hand out red envelopes with money to the children for good luck in exchange for Tết greetings.

It is also tradition to pay off your debts before the Lunar New Year for some Vietnamese families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lunar-year-debt-20170126-story.html|title=Vietnamese prepare for Lunar New Year by paying off debts, a tradition that can often bring stress|last=Do|first=Anh|website=latimes.com|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, each family displays ''[[cây nêu]]'', an artificial [[New Year tree]] consisting of a [[bamboo]] pole 5 to 6 m long. The top end is usually decorated with many objects, depending on the locality, including good luck charms, [[origami]] fish, cactus branches, etc.

At Tết, every house is usually decorated by [[Ochna integerrima|Yellow Apricot blossoms]] (''hoa mai'') in the central and southern parts of Vietnam; or [[Peach|peach blossoms]] (''hoa đào'') in the northern part of Vietnam; or [[St. John's wort]] (''hoa ban'') in the mountain areas. In the north, some people (especially the elite in the past{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}) also decorate their house with a [[Prunus mume|plum blossoms]] (also called ''hoa mai'' in Vietnamese, but referring to a totally different species from mickey-mouse blossoms{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}). In the north or central, the [[kumquat]] tree is a popular decoration for the living room during Tết. Its many fruits symbolize the fertility and fruitfulness for which the family hopes in the coming year.

Vietnamese people also decorate their homes with [[bonsai]] and flowers such as [[chrysanthemums]] (''hoa cúc''), [[Tagetes|marigolds]] (''vạn thọ'') symbolizing longevity, [[Celosia|cockscombs]] (''mào gà'') in southern Vietnam and [[Narcissus tazetta|paperwhites]] (''thủy tiên'') and [[pansies]] (''hoa lan'') in northern Vietnam. In the past was a tradition where people tried to make their paperwhites bloom on the day of the observance.

They also hung up [[Dong Ho painting]]s and ''[[thư pháp]]'' [[calligraphy]] pictures.

The traditional greetings are "''Chúc Mừng Năm Mới''" (Happy New Year) and "''Cung Chúc Tân Xuân''", (gracious wishes of the new spring). People also wish each other prosperity and luck. Common wishes for Tết include:

*''Sống lâu trăm tuổi'' (long life of 100 years): used by children for elders. Traditionally, everyone is one year older on Tết, so children would wish their grandparents health and longevity in exchange for ''mừng tuổi'' or ''lì xì''.
*''An khang thịnh vượng'' ({{vi-nom|安康興旺}}, security, good health, and prosperity)
*''Vạn sự như ý'' ({{vi-nom|萬事如意}}, may myriad things go according to your will)

In Vietnamese language, to celebrate Tết is to ''ăn Tết'', literally meaning "eat Tết", showing the importance of food in its celebration. Some of the food is also eaten year-round, while other dishes are only eaten during Tết. Also, some of the food is vegetarian since it is believed to be good luck to eat vegetarian on Tết. Some traditional foods on Tết are:
* ''[[Bánh chưng]]'' and ''bánh tét'': essentially tightly packed [[sticky rice]] with meat or bean fillings wrapped in ''dong'' (''[[Phrynium placentarium]]'') leaves. When these leaves are unavailable, banana leaves can be used as a substitute. One difference between them is their shape. ''Bánh chưng'' is the square-shaped one to represent the Earth, while ''bánh tét'' is cylindrical to represent the moon. Also, ''bánh chưng'' is more popular in the northern parts of Vietnam, so as ''bánh tét'' is more popular in the south. Preparation can take days. After moulding them into their respective shapes (the square shape is achieved using a wooden frame), they are boiled for several hours to cook.  The story of their origins and their connection with Tết is often recounted to children while cooking them overnight.
* ''Hạt dưa'': roasted [[watermelon]] seeds, also eaten during Tết
* ''Dưa hành'': pickled onion and pickled cabbage
* ''Củ kiệu'': pickled [[Allium chinense|small leeks]]
* ''Mứt'': These dried candied fruits are rarely eaten at any time besides Tết.
* ''[[Kẹo dừa]]'': coconut candy
* ''Kẹo mè xửng'': peanut brittle with sesame seeds or peanuts
* ''Cầu sung dừa Đủ xoài'': In southern Vietnam, popular fruits used for offerings at the family altar in [[fruit arranging art]] are the [[custard-apple]]/[[sugar-apple]]/[[soursop]] (''mãng cầu''), [[coconut]] (''dừa''), [[goolar fig]] (''sung''), [[papaya]] (''đu đủ''), and [[mango]] (''xoài''), since they sound like "''cầu sung vừa đủ xài''" ([We] pray for enough [money/resoures/funds/goods/etc.] to use) in the southern dialect of Vietnamese.
* ''Thịt Kho Nước Dừa'' Meaning "meat stewed in coconut juice", it is a traditional dish of pork belly and medium boiled eggs stewed in a broth-like sauce made overnight of young coconut juice and ''[[nuoc mam]]''. It is often eaten with pickled bean sprouts and chives, and white rice.
* ''Xôi Gấc'': traditionally a red sticky rice that is typically prepared by steaming and sweetened lightly, typically paired with Chả lụa (most common type of [[sausage]] in [[Vietnamese cuisine]], made of [[pork]] and traditionally wrapped in [[Banana leaf|banana leaves]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vietnamvisa-easy.com/blog/xoi-gac-gac-sticky-rice-fortunate-red-of-vietnam/|title=Xoi gac-gac sticky rice, fortunate red of Vietnam - Travel information for Vietnam from local experts|work=Travel information for Vietnam from local experts|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games and entertainment==
[[File:Bầu cua cá cọp.jpg|thumb|''Bầu cua tôm cá ''is a Vietnamese gambling game that involves using three dice. It is traditionally played during Tết.]]
People enjoy traditional games during Tết, including: ''[[bầu cua cá cọp]]'', ''[[Chinese chess|cờ tướng]]'', ''[[ném còn]]'', ''[[chọi trâu]]'', and ''[[đá gà]]''. They also participate in some competitions presenting their knowledge, strength, and aestheticism, such as the bird competition and ''[[ngâm thơ]]'' competition.

Fireworks displays have also become an traditional part of a Tết celebration in Vietnam. During the New Year's Eve, fireworks displays at major cities, such as [[Ha Noi|Hà Nội]], [[Sai Gon|Ho Chi Minh City]], and [[Da Nang]], are broadcast through multiple national and local TV channels, accompanied by New Year wishes of the [[President of Vietnam|incumbent president]]. In 2017, fireworks display has been banned due to political and financial reasons.

''Gặp nhau cuối năm'' (''Year-end Gathering'') is a national favourite comedy show broadcast during the night before the New Year's Eve.

{{history of Romania}}
The '''Union of Transylvania with Romania''' was declared on {{OldStyleDate|December 1|1918|November 18}} by the assembly of the delegates of ethnic Romanians held in [[Alba Iulia]].

The [[Holidays in Romania|national holiday]] of [[Romania]], the [[Great Union Day]] (also called ''Unification Day''&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook, [http://www.cia.gov/publications/factbook/geos/ro.html#Govt Romania - Government]&lt;/ref&gt;) occurring on December 1, celebrates this event. The holiday was established after the [[Romanian Revolution]], and marks the unification not only of [[Transylvania]], but also of the provinces of [[Banat]], [[Bessarabia]] and [[Bukovina]] with the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]. These other provinces had all joined with the Kingdom of Romania earlier in 1918.

The planned border followed a line some 20-40 kilometres west of the present Hungarian-Romanian border, but joined river [[Tisza]] in the South, thus granting the whole of Banat to Romania.  
*'''August 1916''' Romania attacks Austria-Hungary. The offensive is soon halted by Austrian-Hungarian and German forces. In return, with a combined push from Transylvania and from [[Bulgaria]], the Central Powers occupy [[Wallachia]], including [[Bucharest]]. The Romanian capital temporarily moves to [[Iași]].
*'''December 1916''' - The German offensive is stopped along the [[Mărășești]]-[[Galați]] line.

National Councils spring up throughout Austria-Hungary, and prefer to negotiate directly with the Entente powers, rather than with the failing Central Government.
*''same day'' - A reply to Emperor Karl I of Habsburg's Manifesto is passed by the ''Corps of the Transylvanian and [[Bukovina|Bukovinian]] Volunteers in the Austrian-Hungarian Army'', which calls for a union of the territories inhabited by Romanians with the Kingdom of Romania.

*'''October 31, 1918''' - A new government, led by [[Károlyi Mihály]] is formed in Budapest, with the democrat [[Oszkár Jászi]] as Minister of Nationalities. The Hungarian government terminates its union with Austria, officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state.

*'''{{OldStyleDate|November 6|1918|October 24}}''' - As the Entente's victory on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] seems more and more likely, and as the Army of General [[Maurice Sarrail]] from [[Thessaloniki|Salonic]] breaks through the Bulgarian lines on the [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|Balkan Front]], the Romanian pro-German government of Alexandru Marghiloman resigns. A new government, with General [[Constantin Coandă]] as Prime Minister, is formed. The general mobilization is decreed.

*'''November 13, 1918''' - [[Armistice of Belgrade|Armistice on the Balkan Front]] is signed in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], between the French General [[Franchet d'Esperey]], chief of the Entente's Oriental Army, and the Hungarian government. Small-scale military action continues for a few days in southern Hungary. The agreement fixes demarcation lines between Hungary, Serbia and Romania, according to which the region of [[Banat]] goes under Serbian administration, in spite of the 1916 secret treaty with Bucharest. Körösvidék ([[Crișana]]) and Máramaros ([[Maramureș]]), including the cities of Szatmárnémeti ([[Satu Mare]]), Nagyvárad ([[Oradea]]), Belényes ([[Beiuș]]), and Arad, as well as the inner Transylvania up to the river Maros ([[Mureș River|Mureș]]), are left under Hungarian administration. Hungary is required by the Entente Powers to allow Romanian troops to enter the Transylvanian territories east of the demarcation line along Mureș. Hungary is allowed to keep only 8 army divisions. Disarmed troops are returning home.
*'''November 13&amp;ndash;15, 1918''' - Negotiations are held in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] between the Hungarian government of Károlyi Mihály and the Central National Romanian Council (of Transylvania), without reaching any agreement.

*'''November 13&amp;ndash;20, 1918''' - Romanian troops occupy further major mountain passes on the North-Eastern border of Hungary. They have the intent to occupy up about 1/4 of the territory of Transylvania, as allotted by the November 13 armistice in Belgrade to pass under its temporary administration. Hungary pulls out troops to comply with the armistice treaty. Isolated armed clashes with the Hungarian military police occur. 
*'''November 1918''' - During a 12-day interval, elections are held for the '''National Assembly of Romanians of Transylvania and Hungary'''.

*'''November 25, 1918''' - The Romanian Army occupies Marosvásárhely ([[Târgu-Mureș]]), the most important town of [[Székely Land]], in eastern Transylvania.
*'''November 28, 1918''' - The National Assembly of [[Székelys]] in Marosvásárhely ([[Târgu-Mureș]]) reaffirms their support to the territorial integrity of Hungary.
*'''November 28, 1918''' - The elected 100-member '''General Congress of [[Bukovina]]''' passes a resolution of unconditional union with the Kingdom of Romania. Romanian (74), German (7) and Polish (6)-speaking deputies vote ''for'', while the 13 Ukrainian deputies leave before the final vote.

On December 1, 1918 (November 18 [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]), the ''National Assembly of Romanians of Transylvania and Hungary'', consisting of 1,228 elected representatives of the Romanians in [[Transylvania]], [[Banat]], [[Crișana]] and [[Maramureș (historical region)|Maramureș]], convened in [[Alba Iulia]] and decreed (by unanimous vote)

The declaration included 26 counties of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Raffai, Ernő: Magyar Tragédia Trianon 75 éve, Budapest, 1996, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Resolution&lt;ref&gt;Romanian Institute for Cultural Remembrance, [http://www.cimec.ro/Istorie/Unire/rezo_eng.htm The Resolution of the National Assembly in Alba Iulia on December 1, 1918] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608152320/http://www.cimec.ro/Istorie/Unire/rezo_eng.htm |date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; voted by the National Assembly stipulated also the "fundamental principles for the foundation of the new Romanian State":

# Full national freedom for all the co-inhabiting peoples. Each people will study, manage and judge in its own language by individual of its own stock and each people will get the right to be represented in the law bodies and to govern the country in accordance with the number of its people.
# Equal rights and full autonomous religious freedom for all the religions in the State.
# Full democratic system in all the realms of public life. Suffrage universal, direct, equal, secret, in each commune, proportionally, for both sexes, 21 years old at the representation in communes, counties or parliament.
# Full freedom of the press, association and meeting, free propaganda of all human thoughts.
# Radical agrarian reform. All the assets, above all the big ones, will be inscribed. The wills by which the heir consigns the land to a third party will be abolished; meanwhile, on the basis of the right to cut down estates freely, the peasant will be able to his own property (ploughing land, pasture, forest), at least one for him and his family to labour on. The guiding principle of this agrarian policy is promoting social evening, on the one hand, and giving force to production, on the other.
# The industrial workers will be granted the same rights and privileges that are in force in the most advanced western industrial states.''

The union was conditional, and demanded the preservation of a democratic local autonomy, the equality of all nationalities and religions.

The Assembly also formed from 200 of its members, plus 50 co-opted members a ''High National Romanian Council of Transylvania'', the new permanent parliament of Transylvania.

The next day, on December 2, 1918 the High National Romanian Council of Transylvania formed a government under the name of '''[[Directory Council of Transylvania]]''' (''Consiliul Dirigent al Transilvaniei''), headed by [[Iuliu Maniu]].

*'''December 7, 1918''' - The Romanian Army enters [[Brașov]] (Brassó), in southeastern Transylvania.
*'''December 7, 1918''' - General Henri Berthelot, the commander of the French Danubian forces, gave Romanian troops permission in early December to cross the Mures and occupy eight towns between [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and Máramarossziget ([[Sighetu Marmației]]), but he long delayed informing the Hungarian government of this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/439.html|title=The End of Hungarian Rule in Transylvania|website=mek.niif.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian Army is heading towards Torda ([[Turda]]), with the intention of occupying Kolozsvár ([[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]]), the most important city in Transylvania. Hungary is ordered by the Entente Powers to further pull back its troops.
*'''December, 1918''' - The Hungarian Government decides to recruit soldiers to be able to resist the advancing Romanian troops but the time is too short. 
*'''December 12, 1918''' - Romanian troops enter Nagyszeben ([[Sibiu]]) (southern Transylvania). 
*'''December 14, 1918''' - The Directory Council of Transylvania, elected by ethnic Romanians, sends a delegation headed by [[Miron Cristea]], the Bishop of [[Caransebeș]] (Karánsebes), to [[Bucharest]] to negotiate the details of the Union. [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand I of Romania]] receives and accepts the Declaration of Union, passed on December 1 by the National Assembly of Romanians of Transylvania and Hungary. 
*'''December 22, 1918''' - In response, a ''Hungarian General Assembly'' in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] (Kolozsvár), central Transylvania, and the most important Hungarian town in Transylvania reaffirms the loyalty of Hungarians from Transylvania to Hungary.
*'''December 24, 1918''' - As King Ferdinand I of Romania signs the decree sanctioning the Union of Bessarabia, of Bukovina, and of Transylvania with Romania, the Hungarian government protests. Romania starts negotiations in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] with the four [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers, as well as with [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Russia]] for the establishment of the new border. 
*'''December 24, 1918''' - Romanian troops enter [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] (Kolozsvár). Cluj and other major towns are surrendered with no resistance.
*'''January 1919''' - Following a Romanian request, the Allied Command in the East under the leadership of the French general [[Franchet d'Esperey]] allows the Romanian Army to advance up to the line of the Western Carpathians. Entente negotiators in Versailles show open hostility towards the boldness of the actions of Romanians. Romanians in turn claim the decisions of the Parliament of Transylvania should have priority over the armistice agreements between France and Hungary.
*'''January 8, 1919''' - A ''National Assembly of Germans of Transylvania and Banat'' is held in [[Mediaș]] (Medgyes), central Transylvania, and a declaration is passed to support the decision of the Romanians to unite with the Kingdom of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.hu/books?id=Yt1M3egMbWMC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=8+january+1919+saxon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v5q73Sb_NJ&amp;sig=jsDloftyOK8VxDiUbx0_kqHIFL0&amp;hl=hu&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAmaff57nWAhXBJZoKHVANCAEQ6AEINDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=8%20january%201919%20saxon&amp;f=false Lucy Mallows, Rudolf Abraham, Transylvania p. 212]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epa.oszk.hu/00400/00462/00006/6.htm |title=The Romanian Occupation of Transsylvania in 1918-1919 |last=Fráter |first=Olivér |date=2000 |website=epa.oszk.hu |publisher=Kisebbségkutatás -  9. évf. 2000. 2. szám}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''January 14, 1919''' - Romanian troops reach [[Baia Mare]].
*'''January 18, 1919''' - The Romanian Army enters [[Sighetu Marmației]].
*'''January 22, 1919''' - Romanian troops now control the entire territory up to the new demarcation line indicated by the Entente powers. Inner [[Transylvania]] and [[Maramureș]] (Máramaros) are under Romanian control, leaving [[Banat]] under Serbian, and [[Crișana]] (Körösvidék) under Hungarian control.

===Crișana and the Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919===
{{main|The Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919}}
*'''March 19, 1919''' - French lieutenant-colonel [[Fernand Vix]], on behalf of the Entente Powers, notifies Hungary of a new demarcation line to which the Romanian Army would advance. This line coincides with the railway line [[Satu Mare]] (Szatmárnémeti) - [[Oradea]] (Nagyvárad) - [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], however the Romanian Army is not allowed to enter these cities. A demilitarized zone is to be created, stretching from there up to 5&amp;nbsp;km beyond the border marking the extent of the Romanian territorial requests on Hungary. The retreat of the Hungarian Army behind the westward border of the demilitarized zone is to begin on March 23, 1919.
*'''March 21, 1919''' - Hungary's Prime Minister Károlyi says in an address to the people that he cannot accept the territorial losses that the Entente powers press on him to accept, and transfers the power to a radical left-wing government, headed by the [[Communist]] [[Béla Kun]], who in turn proclaims Hungary a ''[[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Soviet Republic]]'', and renounces the passive policy of accepting territorial losses dictated by the Entente. 
*'''March 1919''' - The Romanian delegation at the Peace Conference in Paris, headed by Prime Minister [[Ion I.C. Brătianu]], asks the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Council of the Great Powers]] to allow Romania to occupy the territory up to the river [[Tisza]] (as agreed upon before Romania's entry into the war in 1916). The proposal is rejected. South-African General [[Jan Smuts]] is sent to Budapest to negotiate with Béla Kun.
*'''April 1919''' - The discussion between Entente representatives and Kun government are stalled, as Kun requests that the Romanian Army fall back to the [[Mureș river|Mureș (Maros) river]]. More information about the anti-Romanian repression in the Romanian-inhabited areas still under Hungarian control reaches Bucharest. The Romanian Army is ordered by the Romanian government to prepare a general offensive for April 16, 1919 to force the Hungarian authorities to comply with the Allied council decision on February 28 concerning the new demarcation line. The battle plans are even more bold: according to them the overall advance is to stop only at the [[Tisza]] river.
*'''April 15, 1919, evening''' - Hungarian troops organize a preemptive strike against the Romanian Army in western Transylvania.
*'''April 16–19, 1919''' - Violent battles take place in the [[Apuseni Mountains]], eventually won by the Romanian troops (five divisions), which broke through the front lines into the [[Crișana Plain]]. 
*'''April 19, 1919''' - Following their successful counter-offensive against the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], Romanian troops enter [[Carei]] (Nagykároly) and [[Satu Mare]] (Szatmárnémeti).
*'''April 20, 1919''' - The Romanian Army enters [[Oradea]] (Nagyvárad) and [[Salonta]] (Nagyszalonta), reached the line set by the Allies in the Vix Note. However, the Romanian High Command decided to go over this line and advance to the Tisza river, for military reasons: Tisza makes a natural obstacle that is easy to defend, and at the same time the Hungarian Army was beaten but not destroyed. By doing so, the Romanians went against the wishes of the Allies.
*'''May 1, 1919''' - The Romanian Army reaches the river [[Tisza]].
*'''May 17, 1919''' - Romanian army units enter [[Arad, Romania|Arad]].
*'''June–July, 1919''' - The Council of the Great Powers asks the Romanian government to retreat its troops to the (second) demarcation line and invites Béla Kun to Paris. Romania answers negative, and says it would agree to the demand if the Communist Hungarian Army is disarmed and demobilized. Béla Kun refuses this condition.
*'''July 17, 1919''' - Béla Kun orders a counter-offensive against the Romanian Army.
*'''July 20, 1919''' - The Hungarian Army crosses the Tisza; violent battles take place.
*'''July 26, 1919''' - The Hungarian offensive fails and the Romanian Army pushes the Hungarian troops back to the Tisza. Many [[POW]]s are captured.
*'''August 6, 1919''' - French-supported Romanian forces enter Budapest.&lt;ref name=League&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/timeline.htm |title= Reference Sources: League of Nations Timeline |via=Indiana University, Center for the Study of Global Change |publisher=League of Nations Archives |location=Geneva |accessdate= 28 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist government of Hungary collapses and its leaders flee.

'''Victory Day Parades''' are celebrated on the 9th of May in various post-soviet nations, primarily [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Belarus]], and formerly [[Ukraine]]. The Ukrainian government in 2015 had renamed the holiday as "[[Victory Day over Nazism in World War II]]" as part of [[decommunization]] laws, but even after the change a vast amount of the populous still honors Ukrainian-Soviet troops who fought in [[World War 2]] in the traditional [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] style.

==List of parades==
===Soviet Union {{flagicon|USSR}}=== 
During the entire history of the [[Soviet Union]], only a total of four parades ever took place in [[Moscow]] and throughout the entire Soviet Union. In December 1947 the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] under [[Josef Stalin]], decreed that ''May 9th (Victory Day)'' would become a working day, effectively making the celebrations cancelled and ceased completely. Stalin was also not eager to see the maimed Red Army soldiers who fought victoriously during the war, parade on [[Red Square]], as he had no need for heroes. Stalin had many of the veterans removed from the city limits, and the removal of the holiday helped build his image of being the great commander and hero of the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|war]], effectively broadening his [[Cult of Personality]] during his reign of power.

However, on April 26, 1965, nearly twenty years after the first parade, under [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] reversed the actions made in 1947, thus making May 9 a non-working holiday, this would be the first time Victory Day was made as an actual holiday. On May 9, 1965 the second Victory Day parade took place in Moscow, this Victory Day celebration also saw veterans obtain the first [[Jubilee Medal "Twenty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945"|jubilee medal]] for "''Twenty Years of Victory''" in honor of the 20th year anniversary since the Allied victory in Europe against Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;https://sputniknews.com/russia/201605091039305682-russia-vicrtory-celebration-parade/ Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20180317185211/https://sputniknews.com/russia/201605091039305682-russia-vicrtory-celebration-parade/&lt;/ref&gt; Further parades would be held in 1985 and 1990.

Ukraine, as the second largest former Soviet republic in terms of population, suffered massive casualties during the war. Ukrainians were the largest minority ethnic group of the USSR, and had seen the full force of the Nazi invasion that struck a huge blow to the Ukrainian population. An estimated 1,377,400 Ukrainian servicemen and women of the Soviet Armed Forces lost their lives fighting against Wehrmacht troops during the war. Although Victory Day as a holiday has been altered completely and renamed as a completely different holiday ([[Victory Day over Nazism in World War II]]), many Ukrainians still honor their forefathers in the traditional Victory Day style.{{according to whom|date=July 2018}} Only in the rebel breakaway regions of [[Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk]] do the people completely celebrate the traditional Victory Day parades with military vehicles and soldiers marching past the main squares.

===Baltics {{flagicon|Estonia}}{{flagicon|Latvia}}{{flagicon|Lithuania}}===
The three [[Baltic states|Baltic republics]]: [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] do not officially celebrate Victory Day, as all three consider it a reminder of an illegal [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]], although a shared minority in the Baltic's  retains the tradition of celebrating, primarily from Latvians, Lithuanians, Estonians, and Russians who either fought in the Red Army or have family that fought in the war.

== Expanded summary of the parades within the CIS ==
As Victory Day is the principal military holiday of Russia and of almost all member countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (except the Baltics and the Ukraine), the celebrations in [[Moscow]] and other capital cities thus serve as national events to mark such an important holiday for millions of people, marking the anniversary of the capitulation of Nazi Germany in 1945. The annual or semiannual parades mark the Allied victory in World War II on the Eastern Front, on the same day as the signing of the German act of capitulation to the victorious Allies in Berlin, at midnight of May 9, 1945 (Russian time), officially concluding the Second World War in Europe and northern parts of Africa.

=== [[Red Square]], Moscow ===
[[File:2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade 45.jpg|thumb|The [[2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade]].]]
The most important parade of those being held on May 9 is the one held on Moscow's Red Square, with the [[President of Russia]] as the guest of honor and keynote speaker in virtue of his constiutional mandate as Supreme Commander of the [[Russian Armed Forces]].  On the morning of the day, an estimated 14,000 military personnel, including a regiment of female cadets and youth cadets, assemble by battalions on the square together with the Massed Bands of around 1,100 bandsmen under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the [[Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia]] (an appointment bestowed to either a Colonel or a general rank officer), together with more than 178 vehicles and 3,500 vehicle crews assembled on Tverskaya Street just north of the [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow]], during the major parades a battalion or company of historical Red Army vehicles, estimated at around 36 vehicles and composed of just the [[T-34]], GAZ-67 and the SU-100 plus the optional BM-13N (or at around 260 when counting other vehicles of the war which would take part just like in the parades of 1985 and 1990) assemble on the street as well with modern military hadware. At the air bases outside Moscow (in areas like [[Kubinka]]), more than 80 aircraft are assembled with their aircrews for the flypast segment.

The celebrations begin at 9:50 am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival of the President and the [[Prime Minister of Russia]] to a special grandstand in front of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]], where 6 of the past parades were reviewed by national leaders. They greet the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service commanders, deputy ministers in the Ministry of Defence and commanders of the support units within the Armed Forces, together with veterans, veterans' families and representatives of the Suvorov and Nakhimov Schools assembled.To the left and right of the grandstand are the stands wherein veterans, veterans' families and descendants and families of personnel killed in action are gathered. In between the grandstand to the south of the stands are two platoons of armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in the Imperial-styled military uniforms and some unarmed half-companies of the Kremlin Regiment, both of which would be later taking post to mark the distance of the troops marching past and to line the square's western side facing the Kremlin. At the square, the parade commander (usually a Colonel General with the billet of Commander of the Ground Forces or as the Deputy Chief of General Staff) takes his place in a special Zil limousine, having just received the report on the readiness of the parade from the commandant of the Combined Arms Academy.

As the [[Spasskaya Tower]] of the [[Kremlin]] sounds the chimes at 10am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms as the 154th PICR's 1st Honor Guard Company Colour Guard, to the melody of ''[[The Sacred War]]'' being played by the Massed Bands, marches into the square and past the dignitaries with guard carrying both the [[Flag of Russia]] and the Victory Banner. As the colour guards approach the grandstand, the colour officers execute eyes left. This is followed by the parade being commanded to stand at ease after the colours take their place at the northwest end of the square fronting the [[State Historical Museum]], besides the colour of the Armed Forces. Then the Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) is driven on the limousine to the center of the square nearest the tribune, the parade presenting arms again at this point. The parade commander informs him of the readiness of the parade to be inspected. The report is received, and to the tune of the Massed Bands the Minister and the parade commander are driven to inspect the parading contingents each together with the bands. As the limousines stop the Minister sends Victory Day greetings to each of the parading contingents, in which they respond with a threefold loud ''[[Oorah (Marines)|Oorah]]'' that is heard all over the grounds. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands strike up to ''Slavsya'' from [[A Life for the Tsar]] as the PC returns to his place, the Minister driven to the grandstand amidst louds shouts of ''Oorah'' by the parade contingents where he dismounts the limousine and the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's car led by the Commandant of the College and the college colour guard. The parade is ordered to stand at ease after the Minister informs the President that the parade is formed up for the march past in review and its inspection officially completed. In the 1965, 1985 and 1990 parades, the limousines would inspect the personnel of the mobile column at the Manezhnaya Square, in remembrance of the mounted inspection of the original 1945 parade. When should it happen any point in the future the [[Iberian Gate and Chapel]]'s  gates open for the limousines to pass through and the PC and the Minister pay respects to the holy Marian icon of the [[Panagia Portaitissa]] at the small chapel, following this the Minister, together with the PC, are driven in their limousines past the [[Four Seasons Hotel Moscow]] and then proceed the south end of Tverskaya Street at the north end of the square to inspect the troops comprising the mobile column formed into battalions, after the inspection is finished then will the bands at the Red Square play ''Slavsya'' as the vehicles are driven past the east side of the Manezhnaya Square first and then into Red Square itself. In either case, following the report of the Minister of Defence, the keynote holiday address to the nation of the President follows, preceded by a fanfare by the Massed Bands, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare''. A moment of silence, since 2014, features as part of the keynote address.

As the president finishes the address and a threefold ''Oorah'' resounds all over the square by the entire parade assembled and the honor guard presents arms, the Massed Bands play the [[National Anthem of Russia]] and a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound Retreat and the parade commander orders the parade to commence the march past in the following manner:

::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''&lt;br&gt;''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''&lt;br&gt;''Slope.. arms!''

As the command is given to start the linemen take their places and the field markers also as well at the south end of the square. As the PC ends the commands with ''Eyes to the right, forward, quick march!'' the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, as is their tradition since 1938, march first to the tune of the  "General Miloradovich" by one of its late alumni, Lieutenant General [[Valery Khalilov]], one of the longest serving Senior Directors of Music of the Military Band Service and conductor of the Moscow area massed bands from 2002 to 2016, being played by the drummers and fifers. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums stop playing by the signal of the Corps Drum Major and swings its drumsticks while on the eyes right. The Corps is followed by the colour guard of the 154th PICR and its 1st Honor Guard Company, during jubilee parades, the colour guard is followed by a company of colour bearers carrying the front standards in the order of their marchpast in the 1945 Victory Parade and their escorts, colours from the regiments, brigades and divisions which took part in the original 1945 parade and a historical unit of servicemen in period uniforms, optionally joined by the Kuban Cossacks, in memory of their contingent which marched past on that very parade, and the Escort Cavalry Squadron of the [[Kremlin Regiment]] plus a number of international contingents. This is followed by the rest of the parade ground column, starting with the youth contingents and by the Combined Arms Academy, in the following order starting 2010:

* Youth contingents
** Survorov and Nakhimov Military Schools
** Cadet Corps colleges of the Armed Forces and other uniformed organizations
** [[Young Army Cadets National Movement]] Moscow Area (led by the Chairman, includes female students of the Moscow National Pensions School Cadet Corps)
* [[Russian Ground Forces]]
* [[Russian Aerospace Forces]]
* Russian Navy
* Battalion of female cadets of Armed Forces academies (starting 2016)
* Strategic Missile Troops
* Russian Airborne Troops
* Military Police (beginning 2018)
* NBC Troops
* Russian Railway Troops
* Border Service of the Federal Security Service
* Ministry of Emergency Situations
* [[National Guard of Russia]] [[Separate Operational Purpose Division]] ([[National Guard Forces Command]])
* Military forces of the Western Military District

The ground column ends, as the massed bands play either Victory Day or Let's Go, with the traditional marchpast of the [[Moscow Higher Military Command School]], which has been done since the golden jubilee [[October Revolution Day]] parade of 1967 as a commemoration of the school's importance as the first military officer cadet school to be established in modern-day Russia, the first time it had been seen last in the Victory Day parade ground column was in 1985 (the two battalions of the school's Corps of Cadets also march past the square in memory of the cadets who fought in the 1941 [[Battle of Moscow]]). With the ground segment competed the bands stop playing at the signal of the senior director and the senior drum majors and, to give way to the mobile column, march towards the facade of the GUM department store, with two sections of the MMMC Corps of Drums at either side of the bands, reflecting the formations of the massed bands alongside the Corps of Drums in the Red Square parades of the 1950s and the 1960s.

The mobile column starts with the drivepast of historical vehicles in jubilee years. In non-special anniversary years only a T-34/85 medium battle tank carrying the Victory Banner leads the column of tens of military vehicles and equipment.

=== [[Victors Avenue]], Minsk ===

[[File:A Belarusian soldier provides an honor guard as 34 airmen from the U.S. Air Forces in Europe Band march in the World War II Victory Day Parade in Minsk, Belarus.jpg|thumb]]
The parade commander (the Deputy Defense Minister bearing the rank of Major General) arrives on [[Victors Avenue]] to receive the report from the commander of the first parade formation (usually the [[Military Academy of Belarus]]). The [[President of Belarus]] then arrives at the grandstand in front of the [[Minsk Hero City Obelisk]] to await the start of the parade before 10:00 in the morning.

The parade commander gives the order to begin the review of the Minsk Garrison by the Defence Minister of Belarus, the parade presenting arms at that juncture and the [[Central Band of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus]], by itself a grouping of massed bands of the Armed Forces, beginning to play inspection music. Then as the limousines stop in front of the grandstand and the massed bands stop playing the Deputy Defense Minister of Belarus reports to the Defense Minister on the status of the parade. The Defense Minister then reviews the parading troops along the avenue. As the defense minister concludes the inspection of the troops, he reports to the president on the readiness of the parade. A minute of silence then takes place, followed by a performance of the National Anthem of Belarus ([[My Belarusy]]) by the massed bands. The president then delivers an address to the nation and congratulates the citizens on the holiday. As the president concludes the address, the parade commander then gives the order for the Minsk Garrison to get into their parade formations, and for the troops of the Honour Guard Company to take their post as linemen to mark the distance of the troops marching past the grandstand. The first unit to march, beating the snare drums, are the drummers of the [[Minsk Suvorov Military School]], followed by a colour guard and the standards of the fronts which were involved in the 1944 [[Minsk Offensive]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6891">The '''Yukon International Storytelling Festival''' was held every Summer in [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]], [[Yukon]], generally in an outdoor setting. Cofounders of the [[storytelling festival]] were storytellers [[Louise Profeit-Leblanc]] and Anne Taylor.{{Sfn|Petten|2003|page=34}} Profeit-Leblanc, from the [[Northern Tutchone]] Nation, was the niece of [[Angela Sidney]] {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} (1902 &amp;ndash; 1991), one the Yukon's last [[Tagish language|Tagish]]. Sidney had devoted her life to preserving the stories of the Tagish of Southern Yukon,{{Sfn|Chrapko|2011}} Profeit-Leblanc and Taylor were motivated to found a more local venue for sharing Yukon stories when they realized that Sidney had had to travel in 1984 to the Toronto Festival of Storytelling to disseminate her peoples' stories to a world audience.{{Sfn|Petten|2003|page=34}} In 1987 interested parties came together to plan the first Yukon Storytelling Festival in 1988. It later grew beyond the scope of [[Yukon]] and [[Canada]] to attract [[storytelling|storytellers]] from all over the world with an emphasis on native peoples storytelling and [[circumpolar People|circumpolar countries]].

== History ==
In 1984 Angela Sidney shared her stories at the Toronto Festival of Storytelling. Fellow storytellers were inspired by her to develop the Yukon International Storytelling Festival which was created in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storytelling.yk.net/History.htm |title=History |accessdate=2008-06-09 |publisher=storytelling.yk.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705012815/http://www.storytelling.yk.net/History.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''First decade.''' The first edition in 1988 proposed storytellers from 4 continents and 23 languages (including 16 native languages). In 1989 the festivals take flight and promotes attendance by schoolchildren and [[Jerry Alfred]] was one of the artists. In 1990 the festival grows. In 1991 the festival gains notoriety from a national festival reviewer and changes its name to "Yukon International Storytelling Festival". The Tagish lady who inspired the creation of the festival, [[Angela Sidney]], died. 1992's edition experienced diplomatic problems with its scheduled [[Russians|Russian]] guests. 1993 saw record attendance and box office sales. 1994 the festival experienced severe financial losses due to a windstorm that nearly destroyed the festival tents and caused the festival to relocate. In 1995 the festival was scaled down in order to recoup past financial losses, and produced a surplus for the first time. In 1996 the festival grew once more and saw its second best attendance. The 10th anniversary edition in 1997 experienced its best attendance yet and interest from the [[Canada Council]] finally started happening.

'''Second decade.''' The 1998 edition felt a loss of attendance because of competing local events. In 1999 it proposed a new successful "Winter tour" and finally garnered support from the [[Canada Council]]. The 2000 edition was held in June and had great weather . 2001, rain did not impede the festivals popularity. In 2002 the festival gained much political support and moved into new offices with a new dynamic leader. The 2003 edition saw a successful Circumpolar Banquet and other workshops and events throughout the day. The many forest fires of 2004 created a unique atmosphere for the festival, the highlight storytellers were Red Sky Performance Troupe from [[Ontario]]. The largest festival in 2005 had 12 tents with many different activities. Highlighted artists were Uzume Taiko Japanese drumming ensemble, Aché Brasil performing the [[Brazil]]ian [[martial art]] of [[capoeira]] and Robert Bly. 2006, with MacPap International Brigades veteran Jules Paivio as highlight remembering the Spanish Civil War, was a similarly large and well attended endeavour. Partnership with "Harvest Fair" and the [[Mongolian culture|Mongolian]] [[yurt]]s provided cozy, warm and intimate storytelling venues. The 20th anniversary was held indoors for the first time at the Yukon Arts Center in August. Highlighted artists were SunsDrum, an interactive [[Inuit]] presentation of traditional [[drum]]ming and [[Inuit throat singing|throat singing]], Jeanne Doucet Currie, an [[Acadian]] traditional storyteller and singer/songwriter, Dan Yashinsky (founder of the Toronto Festival of Storytelling) and Ida Calmagne (Tagish, Yukon), daughter of the founder of the festival.

The festival is currently on an indefinite sabbatical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Storytellers of Canada|title=Canadian Festivals|url=http://www.storytellers-conteurs.ca/festivals.html|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
